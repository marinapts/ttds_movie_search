1
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:49,020
Oopsie.

2
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,489
Decaf double tall
nonfat capp for Bruce.

3
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:57,052
You got it, buddy.

4
00:01:57,096 --> 00:01:59,894
That's a wonderful choice,
Bruce.

5
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:02,958
-Thank you, Sam. Take care.
-It certainly is.

6
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:07,530
One Caramel Macchiato.
It's very hot.

7
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:09,473
Good morning.

8
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,408
Vanilla grande no-foam latte.

9
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:13,105
That's a wonderful choice.

10
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:15,306
-Thanks, Sam.
-Yeah.

11
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,910
Hey, Sam. They called.
It's time for you to go.

12
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:21,545
Oh, yeah, it's time.

13
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:22,554
It's time, buddy.

14
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:26,615
It's time for me to go now.

15
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,526
It's time for me to go now,
George!

16
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:30,722
Good luck.

17
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:33,061
It's time.

18
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:37,963
It's time now.

19
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,009
Hurry up. The first floor
is two more floors.

20
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,417
Hurry up.

21
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:57,854
The second floor--
one more floor.

22
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,485
I have to go to Room 324
on the third floor.

23
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:08,189
Rebecca!

24
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:09,997
You the one responsible
for this?

25
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:11,502
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,903
Too late for sorries.
Get over here and hold her hand.

27
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,100
Are you OK?

28
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:19,110
Got a live one, Gert.

29
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,343
Good. Come on.
Focus and breathe.

30
00:03:23,382 --> 00:03:25,407
This is it.

31
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,909
This is it.

32
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:32,913
This is it.

33
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,289
And it's a girl!

34
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:49,238
It's OK.

35
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,545
What's her name?

36
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:12,430
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

37
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:16,992
Lucy Diamond Dawson.

38
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:29,370
You're my daughter.
I'm your father.

39
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:39,986
Get them to make the bus stay.
They're leaving.

40
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:42,016
-I'll get them.
-They're leaving.

41
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:45,326
Excuse me.
Hang on one second, please.

42
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,164
Becca!

43
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,468
Becca! The bus is going!

44
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:01,041
Uh-oh.

45
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:46,387
Didn't you just go to sleep?

46
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,025
Let me see.

47
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,492
OK.

48
00:05:57,536 --> 00:06:02,030
Lucy, you look beautiful
this morning.

49
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:05,602
You look very beautiful.

50
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:18,723
Look at that, Lucy. Nose.

51
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:22,090
OK. Yeah, l--

52
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:24,095
Oopsie.

53
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:12,473
What the hell are you
doing to that baby?

54
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,876
What's the matter
with the baby, Sam?

55
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:22,580
Everything
is just so tiny, tiny.

56
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:25,249
Will you come over here
and help me?

57
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,748
You know I can't do that.
What does her mother say?

58
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,695
Her mother said,
"This isn't my life...

59
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,096
"and I didn't want
a baby with you.

60
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,499
"I just needed
a place to sleep."

61
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:39,504
What if the baby's sick?

62
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:42,336
Bring her over here.

63
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:46,674
Sam, babies need food
every two hours.

64
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,019
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Lucy in the sky.

65
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:58,215
You know...

66
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:00,851
critics and fools said that
that song...

67
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:04,420
had some mysterious meaning,
but John always said...

68
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:07,728
it came from a picture
his son Julian drew...

69
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:10,826
of his friend Lucy O'Connell.

70
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:15,131
So I made a good choice?

71
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:20,908
You made
an excellent choice, Sam.

72
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:24,507
Now, what time does
this little diamond wake up?

73
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:30,150
What time does
this little diamond wake up?

74
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,419
She wakes up all the time.

75
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:39,486
Let's just assume
she wakes up at 6:00.

76
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:44,628
Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.

77
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,297
I want you to feed her first...

78
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:50,274
when "Hogan's Heroes"
comes on.

79
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:57,215
And then again.
Wait until "I Dream of Jeannie."

80
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:03,245
And then, feed her
when "I Love Lucy" comes on.

81
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:05,381
We have to be quiet.

82
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:08,120
I've seen nothing.
I know nothing!

83
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:13,588
Such a nice man for an officer.

84
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:25,205
What are you doing?

85
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:27,269
I'm just getting Lucy asleep...

86
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:29,041
and you're making noise
and everything.

87
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:31,276
-Oh, sorry.
-We're here for video night.

88
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:37,747
Eight years every Thursday
video night, and you forgot?

89
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:38,949
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:43,951
It's always every first Thursday
of every month...

91
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:49,400
video night at Sam's house.
And I forgot.

92
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:51,061
Yeah, and I forgot.

93
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,072
Becca's gone.
"Gone with the Wind."

94
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:56,131
1939,
directed by Victor Fleming.

95
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:57,801
That was a very sad movie.

96
00:09:57,843 --> 00:10:02,576
Here we go.
Everything changes now.

97
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:05,344
Soon you'll forget about
Wednesday night at IHOP...

98
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:07,852
and then Friday night
at karaoke...

99
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:11,322
and I got hit by a car today.

100
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:13,449
You did?

101
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:16,655
It was probably that guy
from the V.A.

102
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:20,096
Did you bring
"Kramer vs. Kramer"?

103
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:25,126
I see what's happening here.
I see.

104
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,660
So this is all my fault now.

105
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,366
Don't tell me you forgot again.

106
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,335
I broke a date with
a daydream to come here.

107
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:35,346
It's your mother.

108
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,373
Hi, Robert. Hello, boys.
It's me, Estelle.

109
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:43,081
Ma, I told you.
Video night's over at 9:00.

110
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:45,112
It's only 6:30.

111
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:51,926
Well, I guess
I'll just wait downstairs.

112
00:10:51,964 --> 00:10:53,625
Sure there isn't anything
I can get you?

113
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:56,657
No, Ma. You can wait downstairs.
That's fine.

114
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:59,227
OK. See you later, Rob.

115
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:00,966
Bye, Estelle.

116
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:05,971
What a pretty baby.
Hi, little baby.

117
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,571
-Doesn't she look smart?
-She does.

118
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:10,376
She looks smart.

119
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,679
That baby looks so darn smart.

120
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:16,085
It's amazing how smart she is.

121
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:17,679
She's very smart.

122
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:21,022
She really does.
I think she's really beautiful.

123
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,924
Of course she looks smart.

124
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,122
She's already reading the paper.

125
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:44,677
Double Macchiato,
low fat, low foam.

126
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:46,445
That's a wonderful choice.

127
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:53,749
Oh, my God!

128
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,191
An ice cube went down--

129
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:57,058
Thank you. Oh, my God.

130
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:58,221
Can I get another drink, please?

131
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:01,892
Iced cappuccino.
That's a wonderful choice.

132
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:02,957
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

133
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,561
Annie, I can't take her
to work anymore...

134
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:07,697
because she's too big now.

135
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:10,230
-Annie.
-That was her first word.

136
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,800
-Annie.
-See?

137
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:15,972
People worry you're not smart.

138
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:18,412
Papa.

139
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:24,055
Yes. Oh, you smell so good.

140
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,650
You can tell a lot about people
by the way they smell.

141
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:45,670
Daddy, why does the snow flake?

142
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,804
Because snow--
because snow flakes.

143
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:51,281
Daddy, what is mustard made of?

144
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:54,479
Because it's yellow ketchup.

145
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,749
Daddy, why are men bald?

146
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:59,689
Sometimes they're bald
because their head is shiny...

147
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,555
and they don't have hair on it.

148
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:04,790
So their head
is just more of their face.

149
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,695
Daddy,
are ladybugs only girls...

150
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,358
or are there boys, too?

151
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,028
And if there are,
what are they called?

152
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:12,832
Yeah, the Beatles.

153
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:15,965
Daddy, where does the sky end?

154
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:17,872
Why does the moon
follow me home?

155
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:19,206
Why is the sun orange?

156
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:21,644
Where does the hour go
in Daylight Savings?

157
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,207
Daddy, do I look more
like you or Mommy?

158
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:30,344
Daddy...

159
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,218
Do you think
she'll ever come back?

160
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:44,925
Paul McCartney lost
his mother when he was little.

161
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,669
And John Lennon lost his mother
when he was little.

162
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:54,839
Annie says that sometimes
God picks the special people.

163
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,905
That's what Annie says.

164
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:02,553
Daddy, did God mean for you
to be like this...

165
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,555
or was it an accident?

166
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,821
What do you mean?

167
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,351
I mean you're different.

168
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:18,865
But what do you mean?

169
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:21,532
You're not like other daddies.

170
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:29,045
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

171
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,277
Yeah, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:35,252
It's OK, Daddy.

173
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:40,088
Don't be sorry. I'm lucky.

174
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,253
Nobody else's daddy
ever comes to the park.

175
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:56,263
Yeah, we are lucky.
Aren't we lucky?

176
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:57,707
Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity.

177
00:14:57,742 --> 00:15:01,371
Sunnyside up, not too runny.
two sausage links.

178
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,938
French pancakes
instead of buttermilk.

179
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:06,075
Fruit topping on the side.

180
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:07,607
The Funny Face special.

181
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:10,815
I think it's funny when
you say "Funny Face special."

182
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:13,983
French, not buttermilk.
Fruit topping on the side.

183
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:15,287
Not on top.

184
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:17,887
You're getting a funny face.

185
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:25,693
That's a wonderful choice.
Thank you, Grace.

186
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:27,898
Thank you
very, very, very, very much.

187
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:29,065
You got it, Sam.

188
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:30,597
Is that too big?

189
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,337
I think that's a little too big.

190
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,107
You need a pair of
good, sturdy school shoes.

191
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:36,272
These are sturdy.

192
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:38,578
The arches
are very important.

193
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:40,949
No. Sturdy is boring, Sam.

194
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:45,616
These shoes light up, OK?

195
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:50,219
These are really good shoes
for school.

196
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:51,456
I know. I love them.

197
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:53,930
I found the most perfect shoes.

198
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:57,128
They look like the shoes
that Dorothy wore...

199
00:15:57,168 --> 00:15:59,602
played by Judy Garland
in "The Wizard of Oz"...

200
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:02,698
1939,
directed by Victor Fleming.

201
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:06,677
These are pink.
These are also Velcro.

202
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:10,647
They might have
a little arch in there, too.

203
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:13,378
Sam, these are
probably too big...

204
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:16,615
but I thought maybe
Lucy would like those.

205
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:21,319
When we were at the zoo,
she liked the animal prints.

206
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,589
But these are for adults.

207
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:26,722
But when we went--
I don't know you.

208
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:27,891
I don't know who you are.

209
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:29,729
I like these, Daddy.

210
00:16:29,768 --> 00:16:33,534
She knows what she likes.
That's why she likes these.

211
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:36,131
-Black goes with everything.
-How much are these?

212
00:16:36,174 --> 00:16:38,472
$16.19 with tax.

213
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:44,006
Because I have $6.25.

214
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,516
That's all you have?

215
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,849
I didn't get my whole check
because I had to go...

216
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:52,220
to the parent and teacher
meeting this week.

217
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm sorry. It's $16.19.

218
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,396
I couldn't go to work
all day that day.

219
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:02,594
It's OK, Sam, because
I have $3.00 to contribute.

220
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:06,502
Sam, I've only got
two plus two...

221
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:12,033
but I need one for stamps,
so 1...2...3.

222
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:13,908
Joe's got $1.50.

223
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:18,848
Yeah. So, is that enough?

224
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:21,408
If there's a God.
I'll count it.

225
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:24,445
Do we get a balloon with these?

226
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:30,219
All of us, or just her?

227
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:09,133
"And I will eat them
here and there.

228
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,567
"I will eat them anywhere."

229
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,666
"I do so like
green eggs and ham.

230
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,074
"Thank you, thank you,
Sam I am."

231
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,874
One more time?

232
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:24,973
-Yeah.
-OK.

233
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:28,417
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

234
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,478
"I will eat them with a mouse.

235
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:32,490
"And I will eat them
here and there.

236
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:34,355
"Say, I will
eat them anywhere.

237
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:37,361
"I do so like
green eggs and ham.

238
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:39,989
"Thank you, thank you,
Sam I am."

239
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,357
One more time?

240
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:46,234
Daddy, it's my first day
of school tomorrow.

241
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:49,729
I don't want to be too sleepy.

242
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:57,075
Everybody says Bob's Big Boy
has the best hamburgers.

243
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,312
Can we go there Wednesday
instead of IHOP?

244
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,842
But Wednesday is IHOP.

245
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:05,321
Just one time?

246
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:08,154
Yeah, but Wednesday is IHOP.

247
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,527
Can I read just the beginning?

248
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,536
Just the beginning.

249
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,562
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

250
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,843
There are four stages
of a butterfly's life.

251
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:32,282
The first three stages are
from egg to larva to cocoon.

252
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:36,686
Last...

253
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:40,316
They're hard to remember
because there's so many stages.

254
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:42,826
It's hard to remember.

255
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,921
33 days. It lasts 33 days.

256
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:50,401
Spiders and insects
are members of the ants--

257
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:52,699
ants--anthro--

258
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:56,104
Conner. Anthropod class.

259
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,233
Anthropod class.

260
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:02,440
However, spiders and insects
are very different.

261
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,643
-Spiders have six legs--
-Eight legs.

262
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:09,744
Eight legs and two body parts,
and they're called...

263
00:20:09,787 --> 00:20:12,449
Conner. What are you doing?
You know this stuff.

264
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,787
-No, I don't.
-You do know it.

265
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:16,259
You wrote that part,
remember?

266
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:19,388
I wanted to do potato bugs
anyway. Oh, forget it.

267
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,558
I think he can make
that boy feel better.

268
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,959
Sorry, Mr. Egg.

269
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:27,699
What's wrong with your father?

270
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:29,730
Why's he acts like a retard?

271
00:20:29,774 --> 00:20:31,435
He is.

272
00:20:31,476 --> 00:20:34,070
-Are you?
-No.

273
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,171
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

274
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:37,203
How do you know?

275
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:38,545
He told me.

276
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,948
He's a retard.

277
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:42,214
Well, it takes one to know one.

278
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:46,417
It's wonderful to have you
for company tonight.

279
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:49,756
Isn't it wonderful to have
Conner for company, Lucy?

280
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:54,520
Yeah. "Sorry, Mr. Egg."

281
00:20:57,368 --> 00:21:01,031
"They per..."

282
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:06,703
"They perched in...

283
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,905
"Si--

284
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:10,380
silen--"

285
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:14,609
Silence.

286
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:17,450
Yeah. Silence.

287
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:22,425
"They perched in silence
for a long time."

288
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,556
Your teacher gave you
a really hard book this time.

289
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:29,192
That's really
a hard book to read.

290
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:34,899
"How can we be so..."

291
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,805
Differ--

292
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:41,004
Different.

293
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:43,980
Oh, yeah. OK.

294
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:50,944
"How can we be so different
and feel so much alike?"

295
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,479
I don't like that book.

296
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:55,014
Let's read
"Green Eggs and Ham."

297
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:58,688
Yeah! OK.

298
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,097
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

299
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:09,068
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

300
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:11,302
"I am Sam."

301
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:20,207
Hey, you.

302
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,719
Hey, handsome.

303
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:29,952
"Premature baby
claims he's Cupid.

304
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:33,657
"Has arrow to prove it."
You believe that?

305
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:38,158
But if he has the arrow,
that's the only thing.

306
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:40,602
You got a good point.

307
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:44,904
This is the lnternational
House of Pancakes quiz.

308
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:47,877
And Lucy found the word "beet."

309
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:51,814
I want to surprise her
and find the word "carrot"...

310
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:53,248
but it's hiding.

311
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,184
Carrot!

312
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:58,211
-Where?
-C-a-r-r--carrot.

313
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:01,020
Carrot. It's right there.

314
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,253
And you're smart.
You would be a good mother.

315
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:10,433
Do you tell good stories?

316
00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:13,460
-I got stories up the wazoo.
-Really?

317
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:14,630
You come with me and relax...

318
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:17,072
and I'll tell you
some nice stories.

319
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:20,407
Lily, what did I tell you
about selling on my beat?

320
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:23,608
Put it down on the table.

321
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,446
It's the lnternational
House of Pancakes quiz.

322
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:27,815
Put your hands behind your head.

323
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:28,944
What did l--

324
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:30,544
Do you have any weapons on you?

325
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:36,451
He touched me
on my private place.

326
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:42,992
At such a time as this,
Annie's the boss.

327
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:45,867
First time in 19 years
I actually believe a guy...

328
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:47,632
when he says he didn't know
she was a hooker.

329
00:23:47,672 --> 00:23:49,503
You say that like
it's a good thing.

330
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,667
Did you brush your teeth?

331
00:23:51,709 --> 00:23:54,701
They don't sound
like they were brushed.

332
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,411
She forgot to brush her teeth.

333
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,475
Let him go.

334
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,646
Says he never spent
the night away from his kid.

335
00:24:06,557 --> 00:24:11,051
Trouble. Oh, boy,
I'm really in trouble.

336
00:24:14,332 --> 00:24:16,994
Are you in trouble, too?

337
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:22,232
Are you in trouble, too?

338
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:25,003
Yeah, I'm in trouble, too.

339
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,113
It gives us great insight
into what she must be feeling.

340
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,482
Mr. Dawson,
it's becoming clear...

341
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,977
that she's holding herself
back in the classroom.

342
00:24:38,022 --> 00:24:41,549
It's as if she's literally
afraid to learn.

343
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:44,720
No one doubts
that you love your daughter.

344
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:49,590
But the Department
of Child and Family Services...

345
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:51,158
contacted us.

346
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,329
They shared with us
that your records show...

347
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:56,306
that your
intellectual capacity...

348
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,740
is around that of a 7-year-old.

349
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:06,215
Our concern is what happens
when Lucy turns 8.

350
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:11,011
Mr. Dawson,
do you understand...

351
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:13,319
what Ms. Wright is trying
to tell you about Lucy?

352
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:29,605
John wanted to try new things.

353
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:35,438
And it wasn't Yoko's fault.

354
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:38,243
No, it wasn't Yoko's fault.

355
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,117
Annie says you can hear it
on The White Album.

356
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,227
Because John wanted
to try new things.

357
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:05,475
"They perched in silence.
How can we be so diff--"

358
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:10,845
Diff...diff--
I don't know that word.

359
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:19,284
Yes, you do. That's the word
that starts with a "D."

360
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:21,883
I'm tired.

361
00:26:21,926 --> 00:26:24,224
I don't believe you.

362
00:26:24,262 --> 00:26:27,493
Are you calling me a liar?

363
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:31,228
Yes. I think
you have to read the word.

364
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:32,930
No.

365
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,369
Yeah, you have to read
that word.

366
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:35,565
No.

367
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:37,233
Yeah. Here it is.

368
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:40,073
There's the picture
where they're all perched.

369
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:42,238
-Now read the word.
-No!

370
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:47,777
I won't read the word!

371
00:26:47,818 --> 00:26:50,412
I'm your father...

372
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:53,753
and I'm telling you
to read the word.

373
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:57,955
I can tell you to
because I'm your father.

374
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:00,589
I'm stupid.

375
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:03,828
-You are not stupid.
-Yes, I am.

376
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:08,066
You are not stupid,
because you can read that word.

377
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,368
I don't want to read it
if you can't.

378
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:19,975
No, because it makes me happy.

379
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:22,884
It makes me happy
hearing you read.

380
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:33,758
Yeah. It makes me happy
when you're reading.

381
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,502
"They perched in silence
for a long time.

382
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:44,030
'How can we be so different...

383
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:46,703
and feel so much alike?'
mused Flitter.

384
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,735
'How can we feel
so different...

385
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,373
and be so much alike?'
wondered Pip.

386
00:27:51,415 --> 00:27:53,781
'l think
this is quite a mystery."'

387
00:27:55,553 --> 00:27:57,350
Keep going.

388
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,913
They have Oreo
ice cream mud pie.

389
00:27:59,957 --> 00:28:01,424
This is so great.

390
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,950
Yeah, this is so great.

391
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,798
And the menu says...

392
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:11,199
you can have your
favorite breakfast all day.

393
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:13,669
That's so great, too, you know.

394
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:16,969
Because you wanted
to come to a new place...

395
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:20,739
so we came
to a different place.

396
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:26,943
Hey, guys.
Can I get you coffee?

397
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,519
No, I don't drink coffee.

398
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:34,922
OK. What can I get you guys?

399
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,757
I'd like the Super Big Boy
with a root beer float, please.

400
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:40,263
OK. What about you?

401
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:49,535
I would like to have
two eggs, sunnyside up.

402
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:51,973
But not runny, OK?

403
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:53,203
Not runny.

404
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:56,179
And then I would like
to have French pancakes...

405
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:58,909
with the fruit topping
on the side.

406
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:02,385
We don't have French pancakes.

407
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,409
We have French toast.

408
00:29:03,454 --> 00:29:04,819
No, I don't want French toast.

409
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:07,483
I want French pancakes,
like at IHOP.

410
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:11,552
Just the same kind
like they have at IHOP.

411
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:13,927
That's what my favorite
breakfast is, OK?

412
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:15,431
They're those thin pancakes.

413
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,196
The crepe pancakes?

414
00:29:18,235 --> 00:29:19,532
I don't even want crepes.

415
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,629
I want to have
French pancakes...

416
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,299
with the fruit topping
on the side.

417
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,605
That's what
I want to have, please.

418
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:27,702
Thank you.

419
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:30,339
We don't have that, though, sir.

420
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:32,611
Do you want
regular pancakes and jam--

421
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,813
I don't want something else!
Why did you ask me that?

422
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:38,413
I'll see.
Maybe they have something--

423
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:41,448
-Yeah, ask Bob!
-OK.

424
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:43,483
Ask Bob's Big Boy.

425
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:45,825
Because the customer's
always right.

426
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:47,558
I understand that--

427
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:50,032
The customer's always right.

428
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,351
Because when Lucy comes
through the door...

429
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,881
everybody says, "surprise!"

430
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:51,486
You gotta stop bouncing
for a second.

431
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:53,759
You'll say, "surprise!"

432
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:55,094
Can we keep bouncing?

433
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:57,623
You'll have to come down.

434
00:30:57,668 --> 00:31:01,297
After Lucy gets here
and we say, "surprise."

435
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:03,932
So you have to assume
surprise position.

436
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:06,772
Should we rehearse it
one more time?

437
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:11,409
Assume the surprise position.

438
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:13,939
Annie was supposed to warn us.

439
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:16,009
Brad, hit the light.

440
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:20,946
Surprise!

441
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:22,652
It's not her.

442
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:24,684
Hi. I don't know
if you remember me.

443
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:26,753
I'm Margaret Calgrove...

444
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:29,129
Department of
Child and Family Services.

445
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,100
We met at the police station.

446
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:32,602
Put the present there.

447
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,729
You have to hurry,
because Lucy's coming.

448
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:36,239
Come on, hide with us.

449
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:37,900
Come on, over here.

450
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,810
Annie said Lucy's coming up
the stairs right now.

451
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:48,750
So you have to assume
the surprise position.

452
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:50,117
I bet she already knows.

453
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:52,952
Why are you being
a party pooper?

454
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,457
She's coming now.

455
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,482
You have to assume
the surprise position.

456
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:59,257
Don't touch me.
I've got cooties!

457
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:00,627
It's contagious!

458
00:32:00,664 --> 00:32:03,497
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your hands off him.

459
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:04,501
What are you doing
touching my kid?

460
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:07,265
-Surprise!
-Leave him alone!

461
00:32:07,304 --> 00:32:10,068
Happy birthday.

462
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:11,472
Daddy?

463
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:12,736
You don't
have to call him Daddy.

464
00:32:12,776 --> 00:32:15,176
She said you're not
her real father anyway.

465
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,772
She said she was adopted.

466
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:27,414
Lucy!

467
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,085
Given the fact
that the father...

468
00:32:29,126 --> 00:32:31,356
was arrested
for solicitation...

469
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:33,158
couldn't control
his emotions...

470
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:35,324
endangering other children.

471
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:39,962
No, you can't!
It's her birthday!

472
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:42,234
Ms. Calgrove also cites...

473
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:45,265
Mr. Dawson's mental delays
which raise serious questions...

474
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:47,675
about his ability
to properly parent.

475
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:49,440
Run!

476
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,175
I find at this time...

477
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:53,877
it's not in the best interest of
the child to remain in the home.

478
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:55,578
And I order her detained...

479
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:59,077
until a formal
jurisdictional hearing.

480
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:01,614
Mr. Dawson.

481
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:04,423
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

482
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:11,162
I wanted to make it
a really special surprise party.

483
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:15,035
So I went, and I got plates
at the Pic 'n' Save...

484
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:20,203
in yellow and in pink--
Like a princess.

485
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:22,735
And then I went
to the toy store...

486
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,045
and I got balloons
with the helium in them.

487
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,311
-Mr. Dawson?
-Yeah.

488
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:31,754
It sounds like you gave her
such a lovely party.

489
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:33,552
Yes, I'm sure it was.

490
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,993
Right now, I want to talk to you
about your legal rights.

491
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,859
OK. There's room
at this table...

492
00:33:39,897 --> 00:33:43,264
if anybody wants
to sit next to me.

493
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,165
I just want to talk to you
about your legal rights...

494
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:49,298
so if you have not already
retained legal counsel...

495
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,638
the court will appoint
someone for you...

496
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:55,907
to present your case
on January 5. OK?

497
00:33:58,882 --> 00:34:00,679
That's a month from now...

498
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:04,279
so I come back here
in one month with Lucy.

499
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:08,849
No, Mr. Dawson. You will have
monitored visits...

500
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:13,556
two times a week
for two hours.

501
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:17,055
And now we're moving on
to 4-D, Parker--

502
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:19,729
What do you mean?

503
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:25,231
You will see Lucy
two times a week for two hours.

504
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:28,608
Why isn't Lucy
going home with me?

505
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:32,911
I want her to go home with me.

506
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,817
Not today.
Thank you, Mr. Dawson.

507
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:39,812
4-D. Parker vs. Van Wert.
Thank you.

508
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:42,724
Of course the judge
picked the lawyer.

509
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,252
For God's sake,
put it together.

510
00:34:46,296 --> 00:34:48,025
She's the one who took
Lucy away from you...

511
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:50,397
so it's time that
you get your own lawyer now.

512
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:52,334
You guys think I'm guilty?

513
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:54,837
-No, Sam.
-You didn't kill anybody.

514
00:34:54,872 --> 00:34:56,601
I miss Lucy, Sam.

515
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,335
Me, too.

516
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,002
You need
a personal injury lawyer...

517
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:02,807
because you have been
personally injured.

518
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:06,646
When Dustin Hoffman
was trying to keep Billy...

519
00:35:06,683 --> 00:35:08,651
from going back
to Meryl Streep...

520
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:11,119
his lawyer told him that
it would cost him $15,000...

521
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:12,554
and that's if we win.

522
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:15,649
-$15,000!
-And that's if we win.

523
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:18,354
Don't worry about money, Sam.

524
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:23,230
Get the best. Century City.
Here. Look at that.

525
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:24,894
Let me show you
what it looks like.

526
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:27,768
Rothman, Glenn,
Harrison, and Williams.

527
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:32,999
This is one of the best ads
I've seen in the Yellow Pages.

528
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:34,271
So maybe we're going to win.

529
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:38,441
-We're gonna win.
-One of the best ads I've seen.

530
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:40,609
With Rothman and Glenn
and Harrison and Williams...

531
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,448
we're gonna win.

532
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:48,750
Did Fred Kimble call?
I'm already 20 minutes late.

533
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,522
What did Michelle Kresge say?
Was she defensive?

534
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:52,961
That's ridiculous.

535
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:54,691
What happened with my car?
Because it wasn't my fault.

536
00:35:54,731 --> 00:35:56,995
Oh, I know.

537
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:00,962
This is Mr. Dawson.

538
00:36:01,004 --> 00:36:03,837
There was some confusion
with the temp last week--

539
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:05,273
How do you do? I'm Sam.

540
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:07,277
Mr. Dawson. It's a pleasure.

541
00:36:07,311 --> 00:36:09,779
Since somebody made a mistake...

542
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:11,576
unfortunately
we only have a little time.

543
00:36:11,615 --> 00:36:14,015
Hold my calls
unless it's my kid.

544
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:17,187
That's a wonderful choice.

545
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:21,186
Can we get you something
to drink?

546
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:22,852
Is it for free?

547
00:36:26,763 --> 00:36:30,164
-My treat.
-OK. Thank you.

548
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,668
Yeah, I would like
a glass of milk.

549
00:36:32,703 --> 00:36:35,399
Did you get that, Patricia?

550
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:37,430
Yes.

551
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:41,677
And Lucy
had an ice cream cake...

552
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:45,307
with pink flowers--
not white--

553
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:48,750
and she likes
cherry vanilla because--

554
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:50,946
If that's Jake Hiller,
put him through.

555
00:36:50,988 --> 00:36:54,515
Jake, no.

556
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:56,082
So I got cherry--

557
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,594
-Your son's on line two.
-Did you get that?

558
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:00,119
Tell him to hold
for just one second.

559
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:01,721
I have to go. The what?

560
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:04,233
...melted together as orange.

561
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:06,793
No. Have a nice weekend.

562
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:09,738
And Brad wanted
a princess on top...

563
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:12,606
with little pink shoes.

564
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:14,042
I think there's a--

565
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:15,738
I think your son's on line two.

566
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:19,078
Oh, my God. Willy?

567
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:21,107
Patricia, get Willy back.

568
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,415
Well, keep trying.

569
00:37:23,453 --> 00:37:27,913
Mr. Dawson, quite bluntly,
you can't afford to hire me.

570
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:32,986
Yeah, because I make
$8.00 an hour at Starbucks.

571
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,726
Per hour. It's an hourly rate.

572
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:37,495
I could pay you per hour.

573
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:39,229
Mr. Dawson, I'm sorry,
but I have--

574
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:43,831
I have to be in court in
eight minutes with the Kresges.

575
00:37:43,874 --> 00:37:47,901
But good luck to you.
Don't give up.

576
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:50,880
I'm not giving up.
Where am I going?

577
00:37:50,914 --> 00:37:52,313
I can show you out.

578
00:37:55,218 --> 00:37:57,118
Patricia, where are my keys?

579
00:37:57,154 --> 00:38:00,021
This is her
on her first birthday.

580
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:03,390
December 6.
That's her birthday.

581
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:05,793
And this is Lucy two years old.

582
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:09,959
This is Lucy seven years old
on her birthday...

583
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,332
the day they took her away.

584
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:13,336
Your son's on line two.

585
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,032
Willy, hi.

586
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:18,974
Jackson told Wyatt he wasn't
my best friend anymore.

587
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,307
Could we possibly talk
about this when I get home?

588
00:38:21,345 --> 00:38:26,373
Willy? Come on, you're
not gonna talk to me now?

589
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:30,716
I bought a bag of your favorite
lemonade jellybeans.

590
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,870
God!

591
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,499
I hate that stupid coffee table.

592
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:53,975
How many times, Patricia,
have I told you...

593
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:56,241
to get rid of
that crappy coffee table?

594
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:05,351
It's OK.

595
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:20,560
You have a son, Rita Rothman
Glenn Harrison Williams.

596
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:24,472
If they took him
away from you...

597
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:26,442
would you do what
Robert said and got...

598
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:30,708
the fastest-talking,
four-name lawyer you could?

599
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,717
I may know someone who handles
these kinds of cases.

600
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:40,621
I'll see if she can help you.
Leave your number with Patricia.

601
00:39:40,657 --> 00:39:42,591
Your therapist
is on line one.

602
00:39:42,626 --> 00:39:44,856
Tell him you can't find me.

603
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:51,593
I'm gonna leave my number
with you, OK?

604
00:39:55,772 --> 00:40:01,733
I'm ready to make coffee.
Decaf nonfat latte.

605
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:06,806
It's coffee up to here,
nonfat milk up to here...

606
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,787
and chocolate
or cinnamon sprinkles.

607
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:13,380
That's pretty good, Sam.
I'll think about it.

608
00:40:13,423 --> 00:40:15,914
We'll come up with a promotion
that's good for you.

609
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,890
But I know what that means.

610
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:28,166
When I worked as a janitor
at the La Reina Theater...

611
00:40:28,205 --> 00:40:32,073
I asked Mr. Jenkins
if I could be a ticket-taker...

612
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:34,942
and he said
he would think about it.

613
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:39,108
And Jimmy Peters got the job.

614
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:42,118
And he let his friends
in for free.

615
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:43,949
I promise you, Sam.

616
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:45,147
We'll come up
with something for you.

617
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:46,985
You have my word.

618
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:49,287
Word, words, words.
I need more than that.

619
00:40:49,326 --> 00:40:52,318
I need to make coffee.

620
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:55,229
I need to pay my lawyer.

621
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,598
I am celebrating
congratulations to us.

622
00:40:59,636 --> 00:41:02,833
These are the moments.
Good night.

623
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,146
By any chance,
did you call your friend?

624
00:41:14,184 --> 00:41:17,278
The one
that does this kind of work?

625
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:22,450
I don't have her number anymore.

626
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:25,017
We lost touch.

627
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:27,723
Yeah, that happens.

628
00:41:27,764 --> 00:41:29,755
If you get
back in touch with her...

629
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,292
and you find her number,
will you call me?

630
00:41:33,336 --> 00:41:35,270
I'm just in the middle of--

631
00:41:35,305 --> 00:41:37,205
It's a special--

632
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,332
Yeah, I'll call you.

633
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:41,469
OK. Yeah.

634
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:42,637
Is that the new janitor?

635
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:46,479
Oh, it's a...

636
00:41:46,516 --> 00:41:48,313
a case I'm helping out with...

637
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:50,285
sort of a pro bono thing.

638
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:53,686
What's that supposed to mean?

639
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:57,853
Cracker went down
the wrong pipe.

640
00:41:57,894 --> 00:42:00,021
You think I don't do pro bono?

641
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,793
Have another glass, please.
On me.

642
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:06,132
No, on you. It's pro bono.

643
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:08,103
I do pro bono.

644
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:10,504
I know. You go, girl.

645
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,168
You just spread that love.
Spread it all around.

646
00:42:23,787 --> 00:42:27,780
Stop. Driver, stop the bus.

647
00:42:27,824 --> 00:42:29,951
Stop the bus.

648
00:42:39,236 --> 00:42:42,797
Wait for me. I got it.

649
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,808
Lucy, he's an hour
and 45 minutes late.

650
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:48,333
You'll only have
a few minutes left.

651
00:42:48,378 --> 00:42:51,973
You can leave if you want.

652
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:54,210
-Lucy!
-Daddy?

653
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:56,344
I'm here. I'm here.

654
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:58,513
It's Daddy. I told you!

655
00:42:58,555 --> 00:42:59,647
Oh, shoot!

656
00:42:59,689 --> 00:43:02,283
I spilled it all. Hi.

657
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:06,891
And guess her name is.

658
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,626
Her name is Rita Harrison.

659
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:11,998
Lovely Rita Meter Maid?

660
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:15,766
Yeah, and Harrison like George.

661
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:25,274
Is she going to help us?

662
00:43:25,315 --> 00:43:29,376
She can't help us...

663
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:31,979
but if she ever finds
her friend's number...

664
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:37,483
who does this kind of cases,
she's gonna call me.

665
00:43:40,797 --> 00:43:43,493
You've grown.

666
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:44,966
Have l?

667
00:43:45,001 --> 00:43:47,469
Yeah. Because your ears
are bigger...

668
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:49,495
and your eyes are older.

669
00:43:55,879 --> 00:44:00,339
Guess what I'm gonna get
when I get my next paycheck?

670
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,681
I'm gonna get
an answering machine...

671
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,552
because then you can call
and leave a message.

672
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:09,388
You can say,
"Hi. This is Lucy."

673
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:11,360
We can't afford
an answering machine.

674
00:44:11,394 --> 00:44:14,522
Yeah, because
I'm gonna get a big promotion...

675
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:17,294
a promotion that's big.

676
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:19,461
They'll let you make coffee?

677
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:24,303
Always set
your dreams high, Lucy.

678
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:29,040
I'm sorry, Daddy.

679
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,842
It was all my fault.

680
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,611
Don't say that.

681
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:37,347
It was not all your fault,
so don't say that.

682
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:41,153
I wouldn't want
any daddy but you.

683
00:44:47,497 --> 00:44:49,624
Did you hear that?

684
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:52,100
I said I was sorry!

685
00:44:52,135 --> 00:44:54,729
I said I didn't want
any daddy but him.

686
00:44:54,771 --> 00:44:57,433
Why don't you write that down?

687
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:03,706
Let me make sure
that I'm clear here.

688
00:45:03,747 --> 00:45:05,874
Are you telling me
neither of you...

689
00:45:05,915 --> 00:45:07,405
wants custody of your child?

690
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,884
He has created a monster.

691
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:11,580
He is exactly like him.

692
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:14,419
Here we go again.
It's the same old story.

693
00:45:14,457 --> 00:45:16,618
The tears and the tears.

694
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:19,093
Oh, my God.
Are you really--

695
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:20,596
You cannot stand emotion.

696
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,292
I'm right here with you.
Excuse me.

697
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:26,059
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:26,102 --> 00:45:30,300
Hi! Did you get in touch
with your friend?

699
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,900
Because I need legal advice now.

700
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:35,706
You said
I couldn't afford you...

701
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:38,077
so I have to talk to somebody.

702
00:45:43,987 --> 00:45:48,822
That's why I told you
I would be your lawyer pro bono.

703
00:45:48,858 --> 00:45:53,557
I don't understand
exactly what you mean.

704
00:45:53,596 --> 00:45:56,156
You told me
that you would be my lawyer?

705
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:57,325
Sam, I'm your--

706
00:45:57,367 --> 00:46:00,302
Golly, because
I must have misunderstood.

707
00:46:00,336 --> 00:46:02,429
I told you that
when we first met.

708
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:05,236
You said
you would be my lawyer?

709
00:46:05,275 --> 00:46:06,902
Yes. Sam--

710
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:10,674
You're my lawyer!

711
00:46:10,713 --> 00:46:12,578
That's right. I'm your lawyer.

712
00:46:12,615 --> 00:46:14,583
And I can pay you per hour.

713
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:16,642
-No, no, no.
-On the hour.

714
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:18,517
Pro bono. It's free.

715
00:46:20,223 --> 00:46:22,316
My lawyer for free.

716
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:24,622
Now, you--God.

717
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:28,688
Thank you.
Because I have to get this.

718
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:31,427
It's "Urgent, open immediately"

719
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:33,527
For my lawyer for free!

720
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:38,169
They want to have you
evaluated by a shrink...

721
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:42,110
and your appointment is today!
At 3:00.

722
00:46:42,145 --> 00:46:43,669
It's today! It's now.

723
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:45,647
I don't actually
want to go to a shrink.

724
00:46:45,682 --> 00:46:47,240
Sam, you don't actually
have a choice.

725
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:48,341
It's court-ordered.

726
00:46:48,384 --> 00:46:51,842
The lady in your office
is crying.

727
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:56,318
Patricia,
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

728
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:57,690
Can you get him out of here?

729
00:46:57,727 --> 00:47:00,025
Don't feel bad.

730
00:47:00,063 --> 00:47:01,997
Sam, come with me.

731
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:03,430
Don't feel bad.

732
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:05,058
We'll get through this.
Will you excuse us?

733
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:09,595
It's their turn now, not yours.
Theirs.

734
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:12,039
If you leave now,
you can make this...

735
00:47:12,075 --> 00:47:13,599
and you have to make it.

736
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:17,272
But I have to take
the number 13...

737
00:47:17,313 --> 00:47:21,977
downtown Wilshire express
to Grand Street...

738
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:27,456
then I transfer to the number 34
at Cesar Chavez Avenue...

739
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,152
because that used
to be Brooklyn Avenue...

740
00:47:30,193 --> 00:47:33,026
and my grandfather
had a bakery on it...

741
00:47:33,062 --> 00:47:34,962
when it was Brooklyn Avenue.

742
00:47:34,998 --> 00:47:38,331
I don't think I can get there
at the time I'm supposed to.

743
00:47:38,368 --> 00:47:42,361
Go, for Christ sakes!
Green means "Go."

744
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:44,771
I don't like to go to shrinks.

745
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:47,002
You and me both.

746
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:49,136
Right or left?

747
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:52,012
Which is it gonna be,
bonehead?

748
00:47:52,048 --> 00:47:53,538
Right turn ahead.

749
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:54,607
Right on Vermont?

750
00:47:54,651 --> 00:47:56,915
That'll be another 20 minutes,
you idiot!

751
00:47:59,055 --> 00:48:02,786
Did your mommy make you
go to a shrink, too?

752
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:06,317
No. Well, sort of.

753
00:48:06,362 --> 00:48:08,262
I spent the whole time
talking about her.

754
00:48:08,298 --> 00:48:10,960
Well, that's nice.

755
00:48:12,435 --> 00:48:15,029
-Office.
-Dialing home.

756
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:17,539
Office! God damn it!

757
00:48:19,442 --> 00:48:22,104
You're going much faster
than everybody else.

758
00:48:22,145 --> 00:48:25,410
I wonder if you noticed that,
because I noticed that.

759
00:48:25,448 --> 00:48:27,245
Go!

760
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:39,120
No more shrinks.

761
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:42,529
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dawson...

762
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:46,126
but if I were you, I wouldn't
waste any more of my time.

763
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:51,903
Sorry, Mrs. Dawson, but I think
you should put Sam in a home.

764
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:55,240
Sam in a home.

765
00:48:55,278 --> 00:48:57,371
Mr. Dawson,
you do understand...

766
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:59,779
that since I'm a
court-appointed psychologist...

767
00:48:59,816 --> 00:49:02,842
the traditional client-therapist
confidentiality...

768
00:49:02,885 --> 00:49:05,183
will be waived.

769
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:06,916
Do you understand that?

770
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:09,254
That the confidentiality
will be waived.

771
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:16,625
Good. Let's begin.

772
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:21,228
I went to a doctor one time
who had an orange office.

773
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:26,402
All the walls
were painted orange.

774
00:49:26,442 --> 00:49:30,003
Do you know her?
She has an orange office...

775
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:32,446
and she's in Van Nuys.

776
00:49:32,482 --> 00:49:34,382
I wanted to ask you about Lucy.

777
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:35,714
How old is she now?

778
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:38,983
She's six. She's seven.

779
00:49:39,022 --> 00:49:41,456
She just had a birthday,
I think.

780
00:49:43,993 --> 00:49:45,688
How was that party?

781
00:49:49,165 --> 00:49:50,962
"Before you read
your message...

782
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,969
"press the red button
for record."

783
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:57,905
Let's start with the O.G.M.

784
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,373
What? I don't know.
I don't think it's working.

785
00:50:04,414 --> 00:50:07,212
I think it's because
it's a used machine.

786
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,913
It's not used. It's pre-owned.

787
00:50:10,953 --> 00:50:14,047
A guy bought it
for his auto shop...

788
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,751
and then he got a secretary.

789
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:17,350
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

790
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:19,918
That's a good code.

791
00:50:19,962 --> 00:50:23,693
I can remember that--1, 2, 3.

792
00:50:23,733 --> 00:50:24,995
4, 5, 6.

793
00:50:25,034 --> 00:50:27,002
7, 8, 9.

794
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:29,266
9, 10, 1 1, 12.

795
00:50:29,305 --> 00:50:30,738
Quick. You're recording.

796
00:50:32,642 --> 00:50:34,576
Hi. This is--

797
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:37,511
Hi. This is Sam.
I'm not home.

798
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:40,015
No, you really
don't want to say that...

799
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:43,985
because you don't want
to tell them you're not home.

800
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,682
-Then I'm lying.
-Everybody's lying.

801
00:50:46,723 --> 00:50:48,782
Sam, you are on the air.

802
00:50:48,825 --> 00:50:51,123
Hi. How are you?

803
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,857
Maybe you sound
a little bit too excited.

804
00:50:54,897 --> 00:50:58,890
And maybe you might think
about lowering your voice...

805
00:50:58,935 --> 00:51:00,698
so maybe Lucy can hear you.

806
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:02,261
Go, Sam.

807
00:51:02,305 --> 00:51:08,039
Hi, Lucy.
Thank you for calling me.

808
00:51:08,077 --> 00:51:10,568
That was good.

809
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:13,548
But did I sound like
a good father?

810
00:51:16,018 --> 00:51:18,646
But it's an outgoing message...

811
00:51:18,688 --> 00:51:22,283
so I think you need to sound
a little more outgoing.

812
00:51:22,325 --> 00:51:25,419
Hi. This is Sam.
I'm not ho--Shoot.

813
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:27,759
Hi. This is Sam !

814
00:51:27,797 --> 00:51:33,235
I think you should
sound like a normal person.

815
00:51:33,269 --> 00:51:36,432
From the heart.

816
00:51:36,472 --> 00:51:38,064
From the heart.

817
00:51:38,107 --> 00:51:41,133
This is--Hello.
Thank you for calling.

818
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:43,042
This is Sam.

819
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:44,410
Wow.

820
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:48,781
I feel that was a very touching
moment right there.

821
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:50,911
I felt that one.

822
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:53,922
High-five.

823
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:58,890
We have a lot to go over,
and I have five minutes.

824
00:51:58,928 --> 00:52:01,522
Rothman, Glenn,
Harrison, Williams...

825
00:52:01,564 --> 00:52:03,259
is on the 29th floor.

826
00:52:03,299 --> 00:52:04,823
That's 29 floors up...

827
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:07,631
and the elevators
are actually over there.

828
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:11,162
Keep up.
Got to do my cardio. 120.

829
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:13,266
Got to get to 125
to make it count.

830
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:16,506
I need that list of names
from you...

831
00:52:16,546 --> 00:52:18,537
people who can testify
that you're a good father...

832
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:19,878
despite your handicap.

833
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:23,374
Just my husband.
I didn't mean your handicap.

834
00:52:23,419 --> 00:52:25,444
I meant your disability.

835
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:28,150
The fact that you're retarded--
that's not the right word.

836
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:29,715
I don't know what to call you.

837
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:34,127
Sam. You can call me Sam.

838
00:52:34,163 --> 00:52:38,725
All right! Hello. Hi, Todd.

839
00:52:38,768 --> 00:52:41,328
I was out of range.
How you doing?

840
00:52:42,772 --> 00:52:45,570
What do you mean,
what's that supposed to mean?

841
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:50,209
You're supposed
to be taking him to karate.

842
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:53,409
Are you eating?
No, I will not hold on.

843
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:54,575
Go pick him up.

844
00:52:54,617 --> 00:52:57,518
I can't hear you.
I'm in the car.

845
00:52:57,553 --> 00:52:59,953
They put you through to me.

846
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:02,253
I'm losing you.

847
00:53:03,726 --> 00:53:07,059
What makes Sam a good father?

848
00:53:07,096 --> 00:53:11,556
The important thing is for
Sam to be a very good father...

849
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:14,161
is to be there for her...

850
00:53:14,203 --> 00:53:20,540
because the smarter Lucy is,
the smarter she will get.

851
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:25,377
So what makes Sam a good father?

852
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:28,178
Lucy's first word was "Annie..."

853
00:53:28,217 --> 00:53:32,210
and her fifth word was "Joe."

854
00:53:32,255 --> 00:53:33,620
And I'm Joe.

855
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:40,495
Sam is a very good father...

856
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:44,022
because he likes green things...

857
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:45,795
Like I like green things
very much.

858
00:53:45,835 --> 00:53:48,167
I like green peas.

859
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:50,604
My cousin Luke works for
the organization--

860
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,904
environmental organization
Greenpeace...

861
00:53:52,942 --> 00:53:55,001
and they like
to save the whales.

862
00:53:55,044 --> 00:53:56,534
I like whales.

863
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:59,013
"Moby Dick" was one of my
all-time favorite classics...

864
00:53:59,048 --> 00:54:00,276
by Herman Melville.

865
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:02,784
Wait.
Why are you recording this?

866
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:04,877
It's often necessary--

867
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:06,479
You didn't say anything
about a tape recorder.

868
00:54:06,522 --> 00:54:09,491
-Who's listening?
-Me.

869
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:11,686
What is that supposed to mean?

870
00:54:11,727 --> 00:54:12,887
Nothing.

871
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:15,454
Who are you really?

872
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:19,394
I need to speak
to my lawyer now.

873
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,954
I don't think you realize
what you're up against.

874
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:45,256
We have to be in court
in three days...

875
00:54:45,294 --> 00:54:46,989
and we don't have
a decent witness.

876
00:54:47,029 --> 00:54:49,429
Now, you've got to know
someone who can testify...

877
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:50,796
who's been to college...

878
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,267
or has a degree of some kind...

879
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:56,294
or has some way
of expressing themselves...

880
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:59,172
that will make the court
believe you deserve...

881
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,175
to get your daughter back.

882
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:03,770
I need coffee. Big, tall.

883
00:55:03,813 --> 00:55:05,804
Tall is the smallest.

884
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:07,372
Yeah, of course.

885
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:09,316
Once you think of this person...

886
00:55:09,352 --> 00:55:14,483
and there has to be one person,
call me at work.

887
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:17,424
Because
I'm going back there now...

888
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,988
to my seven other cases. What?

889
00:55:22,031 --> 00:55:25,489
Mrs. Robeck. I'm on the 405.

890
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:27,001
The traffic is horrible.

891
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:29,630
You want this
for here or to go?

892
00:55:29,672 --> 00:55:31,435
Dorothy?

893
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:33,965
Oh, no. No.

894
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:37,138
Tow truck is towing your car.

895
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:39,010
Son of a bitch.

896
00:55:39,048 --> 00:55:40,845
It's towing your car.

897
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:45,013
No, wait! Stop!
It's my car. Stop.

898
00:55:45,054 --> 00:55:47,386
But, Annie, it's just one day.

899
00:55:47,423 --> 00:55:51,154
And Lucy needs you
because you went to college...

900
00:55:51,193 --> 00:55:55,562
and you can
give the right answers.

901
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,441
And we can't lose her.

902
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:12,746
I'd make it worse for you.

903
00:56:12,782 --> 00:56:15,250
I can't do it.

904
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:18,117
Don't you think I would
if I could?

905
00:56:21,857 --> 00:56:25,122
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Phillip McNeilly.

906
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:32,864
Hi, guys.

907
00:56:32,902 --> 00:56:34,631
Hi, Sam.

908
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,763
Boy, you did a wonderful job
making those signs.

909
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:39,604
You're welcome, Sam.
Good luck, buddy.

910
00:56:39,642 --> 00:56:41,200
Go get 'em.

911
00:56:43,112 --> 00:56:45,376
Although,
at her birthday party...

912
00:56:45,414 --> 00:56:49,475
I believe her true feelings
about her father were revealed.

913
00:56:49,518 --> 00:56:51,884
Objection.
"True feelings revealed"?

914
00:56:51,921 --> 00:56:53,980
Your Honor,
Ms. Davis is an expert...

915
00:56:54,023 --> 00:56:56,218
appointed by the court
for her opinion.

916
00:56:56,258 --> 00:56:57,350
I'll allow it.

917
00:56:57,393 --> 00:56:59,327
Then every child who rages...

918
00:56:59,361 --> 00:57:01,352
because they
didn't get to stay up...

919
00:57:01,397 --> 00:57:03,422
that extra hour to watch TV--

920
00:57:03,466 --> 00:57:04,956
Any child who said
they hated their parents...

921
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,262
because
they didn't want a bath...

922
00:57:06,302 --> 00:57:08,270
would be a prime candidate
for foster care?

923
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:10,932
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

924
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:13,066
I think they want you to stop.

925
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:15,304
Really?

926
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:17,403
Thank you, Sam.

927
00:57:17,446 --> 00:57:19,846
Yeah, OK.
Brad's wearing a tie today...

928
00:57:19,882 --> 00:57:22,908
and I think the tie
looks wonderful on you, Brad.

929
00:57:22,952 --> 00:57:24,817
You look great, too.

930
00:57:28,124 --> 00:57:30,649
There's a lady--
she's writing everything down.

931
00:57:30,693 --> 00:57:33,753
Watch what you say.

932
00:57:33,796 --> 00:57:36,663
I have the best friends
in the whole world.

933
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:40,328
Continue with your witness,
Mr. Turner.

934
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:43,805
Ms. Davis, I assume
in your therapy session...

935
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,502
that Mr. Dawson extolled
his parenting ability.

936
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:49,101
On the contrary.

937
00:57:49,145 --> 00:57:55,209
Mr. Dawson admitted
he felt very confused at times.

938
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:57,310
Actually,
that he felt terrified...

939
00:57:57,353 --> 00:58:00,789
that he'd made and would
continue to make--

940
00:58:00,823 --> 00:58:04,691
and I can quote here--

941
00:58:04,727 --> 00:58:07,059
"Huge mistakes,
huge mistakes...

942
00:58:07,096 --> 00:58:08,563
"mistakes that are huge."

943
00:58:08,597 --> 00:58:12,795
Thank you.
No further questions.

944
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:14,393
You're a mother,
aren't you, Ms. Davis?

945
00:58:14,436 --> 00:58:16,336
Yes, I am.

946
00:58:16,372 --> 00:58:20,433
Would it be fair to say that...

947
00:58:20,476 --> 00:58:23,843
as a parent, you've been
confused from time to time...

948
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,177
possibly overwhelmed
on occasion...

949
00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:27,648
even though
you're a wonderful mother?

950
00:58:27,683 --> 00:58:30,174
If Ms. Davis
has never had a moment...

951
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:31,481
where she's been confused
as a mother...

952
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,353
it would bias
her expert opinion.

953
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:37,223
I know that I have
many moments as a parent...

954
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:39,784
where I felt
I've made huge mistakes.

955
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:41,524
Objection.

956
00:58:41,564 --> 00:58:43,589
Get to the relevant point,
Ms. Harrison.

957
00:58:43,632 --> 00:58:45,691
The point is, you've never
had those moments...

958
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:47,258
have you, Ms. Davis?

959
00:58:47,303 --> 00:58:50,431
Moments that every parent
I've ever spoken to has.

960
00:58:50,472 --> 00:58:53,930
Moments where the task is
so unbelievably challenging...

961
00:58:53,976 --> 00:58:55,841
that you feel retarded...

962
00:58:55,878 --> 00:58:57,743
disabled in some way.

963
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,238
Moments where everyone seems
to have the key but you.

964
00:59:01,283 --> 00:59:02,807
Really, to be honest--

965
00:59:02,852 --> 00:59:04,717
Yes or no?
Please answer the question.

966
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:06,778
I didn't really
feel right now--

967
00:59:06,822 --> 00:59:08,255
Let me rephrase the question.

968
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,554
-When your son O.D.'d--
-Objection.

969
00:59:10,593 --> 00:59:12,959
If Ms. Davis didn't feel
she had made mistakes...

970
00:59:12,995 --> 00:59:14,223
mistakes that were huge...

971
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:16,458
it might bias her opinion
toward Mr. Dawson.

972
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:18,227
I'll allow it.

973
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:21,395
Ms. Davis,
when your son O.D.'d...

974
00:59:21,437 --> 00:59:25,874
did you feel that you
might have made mistakes...

975
00:59:25,908 --> 00:59:27,842
mistakes that were huge?

976
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,171
Yes.

977
00:59:35,084 --> 00:59:36,210
Yes.

978
00:59:36,252 --> 00:59:38,152
No further questions.

979
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:44,425
You made her cry.

980
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,518
I got lucky.

981
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:47,995
Oh, no.
That's not nice to make her cry.

982
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,156
Only in there.

983
00:59:49,198 --> 00:59:52,998
And your secretary
when you hated your desk.

984
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:57,669
Green and yellow
on the same plate.

985
00:59:57,706 --> 01:00:00,470
Could you separate
the lima beans...

986
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:02,443
from the corn, please?

987
01:00:02,478 --> 01:00:05,242
Sam, don't be impossible.

988
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:07,841
Can I have
the spinach omelette--

989
01:00:07,883 --> 01:00:10,010
only egg whites,
no fat, no oil, no butter.

990
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:12,077
-And extra mushrooms?
-Absolutely.

991
01:00:14,757 --> 01:00:16,122
My treat.

992
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:17,819
-No, no, no--
-My treat.

993
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,350
My pro bono.

994
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:23,456
That means she doesn't
have to pay. I pay.

995
01:00:27,403 --> 01:00:29,371
Sam, do you really
want to get this...

996
01:00:29,405 --> 01:00:32,431
or are you just trying to...

997
01:00:32,474 --> 01:00:35,932
trying to act like a...

998
01:00:36,946 --> 01:00:39,471
What do you mean?

999
01:00:41,817 --> 01:00:44,684
You know, like--Never mind.

1000
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,711
I'm a grownup.

1001
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:49,019
I didn't say that.

1002
01:00:49,058 --> 01:00:50,389
You think what they think.

1003
01:00:50,426 --> 01:00:53,827
You're my lawyer,
and you think what they think?

1004
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,329
I don't have a chance.

1005
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:58,231
I think...

1006
01:00:58,267 --> 01:00:59,962
you deserve a fair trial.

1007
01:01:00,002 --> 01:01:01,993
Do you think what they think?

1008
01:01:02,037 --> 01:01:05,370
Sam can't order food
or Sam can't pay a check.

1009
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,307
Sam can't take care of Lucy?

1010
01:01:07,343 --> 01:01:10,005
It doesn't matter what I think.
It matters that we win.

1011
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:11,740
It matters what you think.

1012
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,874
It doesn't matter to them
what I think.

1013
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:17,351
It matters to me!

1014
01:01:18,354 --> 01:01:21,255
It matters to me!

1015
01:01:27,963 --> 01:01:33,128
$14.33.
That's five ones...

1016
01:01:36,472 --> 01:01:39,498
Two quarters. 14.33.

1017
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:42,032
Five ones and two quarters.

1018
01:01:47,516 --> 01:01:52,112
And 17 cents less than 20.

1019
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:59,283
Dr. Blake, what would you say
kept you going...

1020
01:01:59,328 --> 01:02:02,855
the 12 years
you were in medical school?

1021
01:02:02,898 --> 01:02:05,560
Caffeine and doughnuts...

1022
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:09,401
and my mother's belief in me.

1023
01:02:09,438 --> 01:02:11,269
I wish I had a mother like that.

1024
01:02:11,306 --> 01:02:12,500
She must have been smart.

1025
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:14,441
She had great instincts.

1026
01:02:14,476 --> 01:02:17,968
Do you happen to know
what her l.Q. was?

1027
01:02:18,981 --> 01:02:22,917
In the lower ranges.
About 70.

1028
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:26,387
So your mother...

1029
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:28,890
this woman who had
the mind of a 9-year-old...

1030
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:31,722
had the wisdom to recognize
you would be a great doctor.

1031
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,992
Yes. I can't say
it was always easy...

1032
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:40,400
but she taught me the things
they can't teach.

1033
01:02:40,436 --> 01:02:43,405
Patience and compassion.

1034
01:02:43,439 --> 01:02:45,805
Traits most doctors
have in spades.

1035
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:47,706
Mr. Dawson.

1036
01:02:47,743 --> 01:02:51,144
You've become
a wonderful girl...

1037
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,909
and we're proud of you.

1038
01:02:52,948 --> 01:02:57,317
Lucy will be, too.
She'll be wonderful.

1039
01:02:57,352 --> 01:02:59,445
He's very enthusiastic.
Thank you, Doctor.

1040
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,581
No further questions.
Come on, come on.

1041
01:03:01,623 --> 01:03:04,353
How'd you get through medical
school? Where'd you live?

1042
01:03:04,393 --> 01:03:06,020
We lived with
my mother's parents.

1043
01:03:06,061 --> 01:03:10,020
-Grandma and Grandpa.
-Yes.

1044
01:03:10,065 --> 01:03:11,760
Would it be fair to say
that Grandma and Grandpa...

1045
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,462
were of normal intelligence?

1046
01:03:14,503 --> 01:03:15,868
And so,
would it be fair to say...

1047
01:03:15,904 --> 01:03:18,065
that Grandma and Grandpa
of normal intelligence...

1048
01:03:18,107 --> 01:03:19,335
had the real responsibilities?

1049
01:03:19,374 --> 01:03:23,868
Objection. Mr. Turner's
mother-in-law lives with him.

1050
01:03:23,912 --> 01:03:26,676
Motion to strike. Irrelevant,
immaterial, and immature.

1051
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:28,205
I warn you, Ms. Harrison...

1052
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,185
stick to the relevant
issues of the case.

1053
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,619
Your Honor, the relevancy
is that every parent...

1054
01:03:32,654 --> 01:03:34,121
has a right
to a support system.

1055
01:03:34,156 --> 01:03:35,487
I'm not talking about
the rights of the parents.

1056
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:37,321
I'm talking about
the rights of the child.

1057
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:39,788
Please let the record show--

1058
01:03:39,828 --> 01:03:41,090
Excuse me. Your Honor...

1059
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,791
I'm talking about entrusting
an 8-year-old's welfare...

1060
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:45,231
in the hands of someone
whose record shows...

1061
01:03:45,267 --> 01:03:47,633
has been diagnosed
with autistic tendencies...

1062
01:03:47,669 --> 01:03:48,795
mental retardation--

1063
01:03:48,837 --> 01:03:51,397
Objection. Move to
strike that from the record.

1064
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,567
It is clear that
one's intellectual capacity...

1065
01:03:53,609 --> 01:03:56,169
has no bearing
on their ability to love.

1066
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:58,771
Your Honor, would you
please instruct counsel...

1067
01:03:58,814 --> 01:04:01,612
to proceed with
a modicum of sensitivity?

1068
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:03,083
I'm very sensitive...

1069
01:04:03,118 --> 01:04:04,676
especially when
I see someone like you...

1070
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,813
walk in here and try
to give meaning to your life...

1071
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:08,083
by screwing up somebody else's.

1072
01:04:08,123 --> 01:04:10,057
That's enough. Ms. Harrison,
approach the bench.

1073
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:11,525
My mother raised me--

1074
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,687
Tearing apart a family
is truly noble work, Mr. Turner.

1075
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:15,663
That's enough.

1076
01:04:15,697 --> 01:04:17,187
This is an award for you
at some luncheon...

1077
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:18,859
but I'm here every day.

1078
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,664
You win, you're out the door.

1079
01:04:20,702 --> 01:04:25,105
You know who I see come back?
The child.

1080
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,574
Only this time, it's too late.

1081
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:31,306
So am I sensitive?
Yeah, I'm a little sensitive.

1082
01:04:31,346 --> 01:04:33,337
You can't even touch that area.

1083
01:04:33,382 --> 01:04:37,318
Your Honor,
please let the record show...

1084
01:04:37,352 --> 01:04:39,411
my mother raised me.

1085
01:04:46,662 --> 01:04:50,029
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt

1086
01:04:50,065 --> 01:04:53,159
His name is my name, too

1087
01:04:53,202 --> 01:04:56,535
Whenever we go out,
the people always shout

1088
01:04:56,572 --> 01:04:59,234
They say, "John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt"

1089
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,605
Excuse me. Time is up.

1090
01:05:07,649 --> 01:05:10,049
Please, just a little more.

1091
01:05:10,085 --> 01:05:12,383
No. I have another case at 2:30.

1092
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:14,753
I need to go to the bathroom.

1093
01:05:19,995 --> 01:05:21,428
Daddy!

1094
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:23,192
Daddy!

1095
01:05:23,232 --> 01:05:24,460
She said we could
go to the park.

1096
01:05:24,499 --> 01:05:27,935
What happened?
What made her change her mind?

1097
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,130
I started
crying in the bathroom...

1098
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:31,298
so she thought
we needed more time.

1099
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:34,503
There's the park.

1100
01:05:34,543 --> 01:05:37,808
Let's not get off.
Let's keep going.

1101
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:41,282
No, Lucy, that would be wrong.

1102
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:43,250
Tamara's mommy lost her case...

1103
01:05:43,285 --> 01:05:45,583
and she hasn't seen her
in six years.

1104
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:49,216
She had five different mommies,
and one of them hit her.

1105
01:05:49,258 --> 01:05:52,125
I would never
let that happen to you.

1106
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,094
That's what
her real mommy said...

1107
01:05:54,129 --> 01:05:57,360
and now they won't even
let her talk to her.

1108
01:05:57,399 --> 01:05:58,866
Daddy.

1109
01:06:00,936 --> 01:06:03,496
It's the only way
to be together.

1110
01:06:03,538 --> 01:06:05,369
We'll start a new life...

1111
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:08,968
get new names,
live in a new apartment...

1112
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:11,172
and they'll never find us.

1113
01:07:06,935 --> 01:07:08,664
That's Rita. Hi!

1114
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:12,997
It's 3:00 in the morning. Hi!

1115
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:15,168
What were you thinking?

1116
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:17,007
What were you possibly thinking?

1117
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:18,376
I wanted to be with Lucy.

1118
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:19,880
That's ridiculous!

1119
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:21,678
Willy, stay here with me.

1120
01:07:21,717 --> 01:07:24,515
What could you possibly gain
by kidnapping your kid...

1121
01:07:24,553 --> 01:07:25,850
in the middle
of a custody hearing?

1122
01:07:25,887 --> 01:07:27,912
-Lucy told me--
-I don't want to hear it!

1123
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:29,753
Can you possibly
explain this to me?

1124
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:33,454
-Who is the goddamn parent?
-Me.

1125
01:07:33,495 --> 01:07:35,622
Willy, stay in the hallway.

1126
01:07:35,664 --> 01:07:37,564
I am deeply disturbed by this.

1127
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,898
Lucy, I would have
expected more from you.

1128
01:07:40,936 --> 01:07:43,734
I can imagine
what you're thinking...

1129
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,137
but I ask you this--

1130
01:07:45,173 --> 01:07:46,697
What parent
in their right mind...

1131
01:07:46,742 --> 01:07:50,007
seeing their child's pain,
their yearning for contact...

1132
01:07:50,045 --> 01:07:51,945
wouldn't take them
in an effort to comfort them?

1133
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,277
You need to understand...

1134
01:07:53,315 --> 01:07:55,283
something very important
about the father--

1135
01:07:55,317 --> 01:07:56,750
Yes, and if I were you...

1136
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:59,447
I'd look at my conscience
long and hard...

1137
01:07:59,488 --> 01:08:01,319
before I tried
to use this in court.

1138
01:08:01,356 --> 01:08:03,415
Is that a threat?

1139
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:08,828
No! It's...a plea.

1140
01:08:08,864 --> 01:08:10,525
Give him a break.

1141
01:08:13,568 --> 01:08:15,798
Just give him one goddamn break.

1142
01:08:17,305 --> 01:08:21,571
Lucy, say your good-byes.
It's time to go.

1143
01:08:24,112 --> 01:08:25,841
Willy, it's time to go home.

1144
01:08:28,984 --> 01:08:31,384
Goddamn it, Willy!

1145
01:08:33,588 --> 01:08:36,386
Please don't fire us.

1146
01:08:36,425 --> 01:08:38,552
It was all my idea.

1147
01:08:38,593 --> 01:08:41,824
Please don't.

1148
01:08:41,863 --> 01:08:43,125
Please.

1149
01:08:50,305 --> 01:08:53,138
Raise your right hand.

1150
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:55,905
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

1151
01:08:55,944 --> 01:08:58,378
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1152
01:08:58,413 --> 01:09:00,176
So help me God.

1153
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:07,120
I heard you turned seven
this year.

1154
01:09:07,155 --> 01:09:08,622
That's pretty exciting.

1155
01:09:08,657 --> 01:09:11,490
Everybody gets older.
It's not that big a deal.

1156
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:14,290
What'd you get
for your birthday?

1157
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:16,627
I haven't opened
my presents yet.

1158
01:09:16,665 --> 01:09:19,498
Really? That's odd. Why?

1159
01:09:23,905 --> 01:09:25,805
Actually, I opened my presents.

1160
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:29,333
I got the "Help" album,
limited edition.

1161
01:09:32,514 --> 01:09:36,644
I'm sorry. I'm very confused.

1162
01:09:36,685 --> 01:09:39,620
I thought you didn't
open your presents...

1163
01:09:39,654 --> 01:09:41,622
because you ran away
from your own party...

1164
01:09:41,656 --> 01:09:44,523
because your best friend
told everyone...

1165
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:45,719
that you said you were adopted.

1166
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,092
I never said that.
Why would I say that?

1167
01:09:48,129 --> 01:09:50,029
Why would your friend say that?

1168
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:52,033
Kids lie all the time.

1169
01:09:53,668 --> 01:09:57,627
-Remember you're under oath.
-I know.

1170
01:09:57,672 --> 01:10:01,335
-And you know what that means?
-I do.

1171
01:10:02,944 --> 01:10:05,538
Now that we have all agreed
to tell the truth...

1172
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,140
where were you sleeping
last night?

1173
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:12,109
In my bed at the foster home.

1174
01:10:14,523 --> 01:10:16,388
If you're not going to
tell the truth, I am.

1175
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:17,789
Your dad kidnapped you
last night.

1176
01:10:17,826 --> 01:10:19,919
-Objection. Kidnapped?
-Sustained.

1177
01:10:19,961 --> 01:10:24,625
Young lady,
you have to tell the truth.

1178
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:25,928
You're lying
because you're afraid.

1179
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:27,798
Objection.
He's putting words in her mouth.

1180
01:10:27,836 --> 01:10:29,360
Sustained.

1181
01:10:29,404 --> 01:10:31,565
Please limit yourself
to questions, Mr. Turner.

1182
01:10:31,606 --> 01:10:33,699
You have to tell the truth.

1183
01:10:33,742 --> 01:10:35,710
Lucy, are you
afraid to tell the truth...

1184
01:10:35,744 --> 01:10:37,575
because you'll hurt
your Daddy's feelings?

1185
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:41,309
Daddy's right here.
You can tell the truth.

1186
01:10:41,349 --> 01:10:44,978
Isn't it true
that very deep down inside...

1187
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:48,285
you know you need much more
than your daddy can give you?

1188
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:01,963
All you need is love.

1189
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:09,301
Where did she go?

1190
01:11:13,848 --> 01:11:15,907
Please, God.

1191
01:11:15,951 --> 01:11:19,352
Please, God.

1192
01:11:19,387 --> 01:11:22,982
Please, God.

1193
01:11:23,024 --> 01:11:24,582
These responsibilities
include...

1194
01:11:24,626 --> 01:11:26,958
busing tables, replenishing
the Sweet 'n Lows...

1195
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,395
sweeping up the place?

1196
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:30,523
Yes.

1197
01:11:30,565 --> 01:11:32,430
Aren't these Mr. Dawson's
only responsibilities?

1198
01:11:32,467 --> 01:11:34,901
Because he doesn't have
the mental capacity...

1199
01:11:34,936 --> 01:11:39,771
to run a cash register
or even make a cup of coffee.

1200
01:11:39,808 --> 01:11:41,105
As a matter of fact...

1201
01:11:41,142 --> 01:11:42,541
Sam and I were
discussing a promotion...

1202
01:11:42,577 --> 01:11:44,272
we were going to put
into effect next week.

1203
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:47,770
Hooray for me!
Thank you, George.

1204
01:11:47,816 --> 01:11:49,283
Thank you, George.
That's very nice.

1205
01:11:49,317 --> 01:11:52,115
After eight years,
Sam can make a cup of coffee...

1206
01:11:52,153 --> 01:11:54,553
and he can certainly
help Lucy with her geometry.

1207
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:55,556
Objection.

1208
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:58,320
And when I ask
another question...

1209
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,590
-I answer in one sentence.
-Short and sweet.

1210
01:12:00,629 --> 01:12:03,894
Yes. One sentence.
Short and sweet.

1211
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:05,866
Tim Curry was
a sweet transvestite...

1212
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,868
in
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show."

1213
01:12:07,902 --> 01:12:10,166
Let's try one word.

1214
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:12,139
Annie!

1215
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:17,076
You're here! You're here!

1216
01:12:17,112 --> 01:12:18,909
Susan Sarandon is also
one of my favorite actresses.

1217
01:12:18,947 --> 01:12:21,006
Besides being
Lucy's godmother...

1218
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:22,846
aren't you also
her piano teacher?

1219
01:12:22,884 --> 01:12:24,476
Yes.

1220
01:12:24,519 --> 01:12:26,680
Annie plays the piano
beautifully.

1221
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:28,689
You really do, Annie.

1222
01:12:28,723 --> 01:12:31,556
Sam, it's Annie's turn now.

1223
01:12:31,593 --> 01:12:34,027
And didn't you graduate
magna cum laude...

1224
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:35,893
from the
Juillard School of Music?

1225
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,363
Summa cum laude.

1226
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:40,562
Excuse me.

1227
01:12:40,602 --> 01:12:43,264
Ms. Cassell, in all the time
you've known them...

1228
01:12:43,304 --> 01:12:47,604
have you ever questioned
Sam's ability as a father?

1229
01:12:47,642 --> 01:12:50,907
-Never.
-Never?

1230
01:12:50,945 --> 01:12:53,573
Look at Lucy. She's strong.

1231
01:12:53,615 --> 01:12:56,982
She displays true empathy
for people...

1232
01:12:57,018 --> 01:12:59,179
all kinds of people.

1233
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,778
I know that you all think...

1234
01:13:00,822 --> 01:13:04,121
she's as smart as she is
despite him...

1235
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,593
but it's because of him.

1236
01:13:06,628 --> 01:13:08,186
So, what you're saying is...

1237
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:10,424
you don't worry
about Lucy's future.

1238
01:13:10,465 --> 01:13:12,126
No. I do.

1239
01:13:14,736 --> 01:13:17,705
I...

1240
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:20,902
I worry all the time.

1241
01:13:23,378 --> 01:13:27,644
If they take Lucy
away from her father...

1242
01:13:27,682 --> 01:13:31,948
they will take away
an enormous piece of her...

1243
01:13:31,986 --> 01:13:37,549
and I worry that she will spend
the rest of her life...

1244
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:41,653
trying to fill that hole.

1245
01:13:43,031 --> 01:13:45,397
Thank you, Ms. Cassell.

1246
01:13:45,433 --> 01:13:47,128
No further questions.

1247
01:13:49,003 --> 01:13:52,097
Thank you for coming here
today, Annie.

1248
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,600
You're welcome, Sam.

1249
01:13:56,644 --> 01:13:58,305
Can Sam add?

1250
01:13:58,346 --> 01:14:00,814
Yes.

1251
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:03,044
What about multiplication?

1252
01:14:03,084 --> 01:14:04,483
He's learning.

1253
01:14:04,519 --> 01:14:07,852
What does that mean?
He can't multiply two times two?

1254
01:14:07,889 --> 01:14:11,518
I don't know about you,
Mr. Turner...

1255
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:13,959
but my memories of my parents...

1256
01:14:13,995 --> 01:14:17,123
have nothing to do with
the times table...

1257
01:14:17,165 --> 01:14:19,633
or with state capitals.

1258
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:22,397
A truck ran into
the state capital building...

1259
01:14:22,437 --> 01:14:25,463
and it went on fire
on television.

1260
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:28,305
I saw that on the news with
the reporter with the toupee...

1261
01:14:28,343 --> 01:14:30,538
and Mr. Turner lost his toupee.

1262
01:14:30,578 --> 01:14:33,274
Thank you, Mr. Wali.

1263
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:39,817
I bet
he's knocking on your door...

1264
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:41,185
asking questions all the time.

1265
01:14:41,222 --> 01:14:43,986
Yes. All the time.

1266
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:47,290
Let's see.
The last question...

1267
01:14:47,328 --> 01:14:50,661
was whether to use
Biz or Clorox...

1268
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:53,826
to get the grass stains
out of Lucy's soccer uniform.

1269
01:14:56,905 --> 01:15:00,204
Eventually,
Lucy will go through puberty.

1270
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:02,539
How much insight or know-how...

1271
01:15:02,577 --> 01:15:06,035
will he bring to
those sensitive subjects...

1272
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,775
of a young girl's development?

1273
01:15:07,816 --> 01:15:09,181
I can only imagine how much...

1274
01:15:09,217 --> 01:15:11,651
insight and sensitivity
you yourself would bring...

1275
01:15:11,686 --> 01:15:13,881
to that delicate area,
Mr. Turner...

1276
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:15,856
or any father, for that matter.

1277
01:15:18,326 --> 01:15:20,089
And you've had plenty
of opportunity...

1278
01:15:20,128 --> 01:15:21,152
to observe fathers,
haven't you?

1279
01:15:21,196 --> 01:15:22,595
Objection.

1280
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:25,531
The fact that Ms. Cassell
hasn't left her room in...

1281
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,694
I don't know
how many years...

1282
01:15:27,735 --> 01:15:29,532
must have some effect
on her perception.

1283
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:33,564
I'll allow it.
Please answer the question.

1284
01:15:35,343 --> 01:15:38,437
I have had 28 years
in the real world...

1285
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,073
and...

1286
01:15:41,115 --> 01:15:44,881
I have been able to observe
all kinds of fathers.

1287
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:47,615
What about your father?

1288
01:15:50,892 --> 01:15:52,917
Ms. Cassell...

1289
01:15:52,961 --> 01:15:54,724
since you seem to be
such an expert...

1290
01:15:54,762 --> 01:15:56,559
on father-daughter
relationships.

1291
01:16:08,943 --> 01:16:12,936
I'm sorry, Ms. Cassell.
I need to hear your response.

1292
01:16:14,415 --> 01:16:16,246
What about your father?

1293
01:16:21,589 --> 01:16:23,489
What about your father?

1294
01:16:23,524 --> 01:16:25,014
Objection to that.

1295
01:16:25,059 --> 01:16:26,617
Excuse me, Mr. Dawson. Please.

1296
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:30,324
-Overruled.
-That's overruled.

1297
01:16:30,365 --> 01:16:33,493
Mr. Dawson, please sit down.

1298
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:35,900
Overruled.

1299
01:16:35,937 --> 01:16:38,405
Mr. Dawson, sit down!

1300
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:41,408
Annie's father was a meanie.

1301
01:16:41,442 --> 01:16:45,742
Sam has his big day
on the stand tomorrow...

1302
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,714
and we need to do
a little bit of work...

1303
01:16:47,749 --> 01:16:49,649
so he's as effective
as you were.

1304
01:16:49,684 --> 01:16:54,178
I want to be as effective
as you were, Annie.

1305
01:16:54,222 --> 01:16:57,089
On the Porsche,
the door handle...

1306
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,958
is a little hidden
by that thingamajig.

1307
01:16:59,994 --> 01:17:01,655
So, if you're having
trouble finding it--

1308
01:17:01,696 --> 01:17:03,254
No!

1309
01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:08,565
I think maybe Annie's
not exactly ready to go yet.

1310
01:17:08,603 --> 01:17:10,366
We'll just take our time.

1311
01:17:12,573 --> 01:17:15,201
-Home.
-Dialing office.

1312
01:17:15,243 --> 01:17:18,906
-Home.
-Dialing office.

1313
01:17:18,947 --> 01:17:21,347
Home, god damn it!

1314
01:17:21,382 --> 01:17:23,612
I'm ready now.

1315
01:17:23,651 --> 01:17:25,551
Good. Fine.

1316
01:17:25,586 --> 01:17:28,054
Sam, Annie's ready.

1317
01:17:48,876 --> 01:17:50,707
Wow!

1318
01:17:51,879 --> 01:17:53,813
Let's work in the den.
It's down here.

1319
01:18:13,067 --> 01:18:15,763
Hey, Willy. Where's your dad?

1320
01:18:15,803 --> 01:18:17,566
Guess.

1321
01:18:17,605 --> 01:18:19,129
I don't want to guess.
Where is he?

1322
01:18:19,173 --> 01:18:21,607
Where was he last night?

1323
01:18:21,642 --> 01:18:23,303
Working. Late.

1324
01:18:23,344 --> 01:18:24,709
There. You guessed it.

1325
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:26,839
Did he say who was
supposed to take care of you?

1326
01:18:26,881 --> 01:18:29,611
You. But you said
you were working late, too.

1327
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:31,675
I am working late.

1328
01:18:34,689 --> 01:18:35,781
How was your day?

1329
01:18:35,823 --> 01:18:37,814
You have to work. Go work.

1330
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:39,554
How was your--

1331
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:43,220
Hello? Where are you?

1332
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:45,323
I've been waiting here an hour.

1333
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,407
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1334
01:18:55,443 --> 01:18:58,037
You were on line two.

1335
01:18:58,079 --> 01:18:59,671
You don't sound
like you're on the freeway.

1336
01:19:04,819 --> 01:19:09,188
Danger, Will Robinson. Danger.

1337
01:19:14,195 --> 01:19:16,629
There you are.

1338
01:19:16,664 --> 01:19:19,929
You gonna come see the movie?
It's the best part.

1339
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:22,800
It's getting late.
We better get to work.

1340
01:19:27,308 --> 01:19:28,935
It's time to get ready for bed.

1341
01:19:33,281 --> 01:19:34,908
Willy, it's time for bed.

1342
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,151
Our strategy is...

1343
01:19:40,188 --> 01:19:42,247
we're aggressively pursuing
a support system.

1344
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:43,621
I'm going to ask you...

1345
01:19:43,658 --> 01:19:46,422
"How are you prepared
to help Lucy at school?"

1346
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:49,362
Let me see. Let me see.

1347
01:19:49,397 --> 01:19:51,763
Sam, I told you,
you have to stop saying that.

1348
01:19:51,799 --> 01:19:54,461
It makes you look stupid.

1349
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:57,903
OK, try again.

1350
01:19:59,507 --> 01:20:01,475
You say
you will find her a tutor.

1351
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:02,976
Then I say,
"How will you pay for it?"

1352
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:06,343
Could you slow down?

1353
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,349
Why do you eat so fast?

1354
01:20:09,383 --> 01:20:11,351
We have been over this
a million times.

1355
01:20:11,385 --> 01:20:13,615
Yeah.

1356
01:20:13,654 --> 01:20:16,953
You found her a free
tutoring service at the YWCA.

1357
01:20:16,991 --> 01:20:19,585
But I didn't. You did.

1358
01:20:23,898 --> 01:20:29,131
Can you grasp the concept of...

1359
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,933
manipulating the truth?

1360
01:20:30,972 --> 01:20:32,439
Not lying.

1361
01:20:32,473 --> 01:20:35,909
Just a little tweak
here and there.

1362
01:20:38,346 --> 01:20:39,813
No.

1363
01:20:44,585 --> 01:20:45,916
You're so lucky.

1364
01:20:45,953 --> 01:20:49,354
You get to play with Willy
any time you want.

1365
01:20:51,926 --> 01:20:54,053
He doesn't
want to play with me.

1366
01:20:55,963 --> 01:20:58,761
Yes, he does.

1367
01:20:58,799 --> 01:21:01,063
Yes, he does. He does.

1368
01:21:01,102 --> 01:21:03,798
He thinks
you don't want to play, maybe.

1369
01:21:03,838 --> 01:21:05,863
That's ridiculous.
Of course I do.

1370
01:21:07,475 --> 01:21:08,669
Tweak.

1371
01:21:08,709 --> 01:21:12,145
I drove around after work
yesterday till 9:30...

1372
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:16,276
Iooking for
that frigging Raptor scooter!

1373
01:21:28,095 --> 01:21:31,462
So, what made you harass
that young boy at your house?

1374
01:21:31,499 --> 01:21:36,527
I didn't harass that boy,
and you know it, Rita.

1375
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:40,098
I'm pretending to be Mr. Turner.
Remember?

1376
01:21:46,147 --> 01:21:50,243
If I look at you,
I'm gonna laugh again.

1377
01:21:54,989 --> 01:21:57,355
OK, Mr. Turner.

1378
01:21:57,391 --> 01:21:59,825
I'm Mr. Turner. All right?

1379
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:03,159
Isn't Lucy already
smarter than you?

1380
01:22:03,197 --> 01:22:05,597
You buried yourself.
You've got to do better.

1381
01:22:05,633 --> 01:22:09,626
I kind of think
we're the same smart.

1382
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:10,728
What does that mean?

1383
01:22:10,771 --> 01:22:13,467
I know the bus routes
better than she does.

1384
01:22:13,507 --> 01:22:16,203
How does that make you
the same smart?

1385
01:22:18,446 --> 01:22:20,971
Doesn't every parent
want their kid to be smart?

1386
01:22:21,015 --> 01:22:23,882
That's true,
but the issue here is that...

1387
01:22:23,918 --> 01:22:27,479
at the age of seven,
Lucy is smarter than you.

1388
01:22:27,521 --> 01:22:32,458
But in some ways,
I'm smarter than she is.

1389
01:22:32,493 --> 01:22:34,825
You got to be firm on this.

1390
01:22:40,568 --> 01:22:44,402
In some ways, she's--

1391
01:22:44,438 --> 01:22:47,305
In some ways,
I'm smarter than her.

1392
01:22:47,341 --> 01:22:50,538
In some ways, I'm smarter
than you, Mr. Turner.

1393
01:22:50,578 --> 01:22:54,309
In some ways, I'm smarter
than you, Judge McNeilly.

1394
01:22:54,348 --> 01:22:58,045
Whoa. Take it down.

1395
01:23:05,693 --> 01:23:07,160
Want some marshmallows?

1396
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:09,822
This is my husband's.
He'll never notice.

1397
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:11,832
He has ten more just like it.

1398
01:23:14,402 --> 01:23:15,630
Try it on.

1399
01:23:17,805 --> 01:23:19,432
Will you look that way?

1400
01:23:19,473 --> 01:23:20,963
In there.

1401
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:30,040
I wasn't exactly sure
how to tie this.

1402
01:23:30,084 --> 01:23:32,018
Does it look bad?

1403
01:23:36,757 --> 01:23:39,590
No. Very, very good.

1404
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:48,791
Cross over once.

1405
01:23:48,836 --> 01:23:52,795
And loop this around...

1406
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:57,868
and up inside of the neck.

1407
01:23:57,912 --> 01:24:03,077
And then pull up
on the skinny part.

1408
01:24:04,518 --> 01:24:07,214
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1409
01:24:20,401 --> 01:24:22,767
Today's your big day, buddy.
Making coffee.

1410
01:24:27,942 --> 01:24:31,002
-You ready?
-Thank you, George.

1411
01:24:31,045 --> 01:24:32,205
What time
you got to be in court?

1412
01:24:32,246 --> 01:24:36,148
I have to be
on the stand at 2:00.

1413
01:24:36,183 --> 01:24:40,916
Two venti Caramel Macchiatos.
That's a wonderful choice.

1414
01:24:40,955 --> 01:24:45,153
Two cappuccinos
and a Hazelnut Frappuccino.

1415
01:24:45,192 --> 01:24:47,752
Two Orange Mocha Chip
Frappucinos.

1416
01:24:47,795 --> 01:24:51,162
Two Caramel Frappucinos and a--

1417
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:54,292
I'm sorry. Can you
tell me that one more time?

1418
01:24:54,335 --> 01:24:57,099
Everybody's very thirsty today.

1419
01:24:57,138 --> 01:24:59,663
Oh, boy.

1420
01:24:59,707 --> 01:25:02,801
I'm going as fast as I can.
That's the only thing.

1421
01:25:02,843 --> 01:25:04,674
But I don't have all day.

1422
01:25:04,712 --> 01:25:07,510
No, just another
couple of minutes.

1423
01:25:07,548 --> 01:25:08,572
Not all day.

1424
01:25:08,616 --> 01:25:11,084
You know what? Fine.
Forget it. Thank you.

1425
01:25:13,387 --> 01:25:16,618
Sam, I need that tall decaf
vanilla drip right away.

1426
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:20,787
A vanilla drip. Sorry.

1427
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:23,523
Sorry.

1428
01:25:25,232 --> 01:25:28,395
I really have to hurry, though.

1429
01:25:28,436 --> 01:25:30,495
Is that enough? Oh, shoot.

1430
01:25:30,538 --> 01:25:32,472
Maybe you want something else.

1431
01:25:32,506 --> 01:25:35,634
Sam, I need
a grande soy latte...

1432
01:25:35,676 --> 01:25:37,507
but don't put any whipped cream
or foam on it.

1433
01:25:37,545 --> 01:25:40,139
I'm just trying to go
really fast.

1434
01:25:43,417 --> 01:25:46,250
-Oh, no!
-Sam, you'll be late.

1435
01:25:49,757 --> 01:25:52,419
Your Honor, I'm sure
he'll be here any moment.

1436
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:55,486
This is an extremely
important day to Mr. Dawson.

1437
01:25:55,529 --> 01:25:57,997
I'm here!

1438
01:25:58,032 --> 01:25:59,499
Sorry.

1439
01:25:59,533 --> 01:26:02,001
Your Honor, may I have a moment
to confer with my client?

1440
01:26:02,036 --> 01:26:03,333
Make it brief, Ms. Harrison.

1441
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:05,895
What the hell happened to you?

1442
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,965
-I'm late.
-What's that smell? Mint?

1443
01:26:08,008 --> 01:26:11,205
No, no. The blender exploded.

1444
01:26:11,245 --> 01:26:12,212
Look at me.

1445
01:26:12,246 --> 01:26:14,544
Slow down,
because Lucy needs you.

1446
01:26:14,582 --> 01:26:16,209
Yeah, Lucy needs me.

1447
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,740
We need you, Ms. Harrison.

1448
01:26:17,785 --> 01:26:20,811
I go in there now,
because it's my turn.

1449
01:26:20,855 --> 01:26:22,482
Go sit.

1450
01:26:25,826 --> 01:26:29,159
How will you be able
to pay for private tutoring?

1451
01:26:29,196 --> 01:26:34,657
There's a free program
at the YWCA...

1452
01:26:34,702 --> 01:26:38,661
and Lucy can go to that program.

1453
01:26:38,706 --> 01:26:40,901
Don't you ever think
it would be better for Lucy...

1454
01:26:40,941 --> 01:26:44,342
if she lived with
a permanent foster family...

1455
01:26:44,378 --> 01:26:45,675
and you could visit
whenever you wanted?

1456
01:26:45,713 --> 01:26:50,650
No, I don't think
that's a very good idea, see.

1457
01:26:50,684 --> 01:26:55,678
Because the Fosters,
they don't know Lucy.

1458
01:26:55,723 --> 01:26:58,783
And I know Lucy
because I'm her father.

1459
01:26:58,826 --> 01:27:03,024
So, I think
if they want to see her...

1460
01:27:03,063 --> 01:27:08,091
then the Fosters can come over
to our house to visit her.

1461
01:27:08,135 --> 01:27:11,070
And I'm very firm on this.

1462
01:27:11,105 --> 01:27:18,637
I'm very firm on this idea,
because Lucy belongs with me.

1463
01:27:19,647 --> 01:27:20,841
Why?

1464
01:27:30,457 --> 01:27:34,553
Remember when Paul McCartney
wrote the song "Michelle"...

1465
01:27:34,595 --> 01:27:38,429
and then he only wrote
the first part, Annie said.

1466
01:27:38,465 --> 01:27:41,298
And then he gave
that part to John Lennon...

1467
01:27:41,335 --> 01:27:43,098
and he wrote the part
that said...

1468
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:45,901
"I love you,
I love you, I love you."

1469
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,374
Annie said
that it wouldn't have been...

1470
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:50,502
the same song without that...

1471
01:27:50,544 --> 01:27:53,274
and that's why
the whole world cried...

1472
01:27:53,314 --> 01:27:57,910
when the Beatles broke up
on April 10, 1970.

1473
01:28:03,457 --> 01:28:06,017
No further questions.

1474
01:28:07,628 --> 01:28:09,960
So, your parents put you
in an institution.

1475
01:28:12,266 --> 01:28:15,758
My mother got sick, see...

1476
01:28:15,803 --> 01:28:17,862
so I had to go in
an institution...

1477
01:28:17,905 --> 01:28:19,930
when my mother got sick.

1478
01:28:19,974 --> 01:28:22,340
What about your father?
Where was he?

1479
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:25,868
He was gone when I was born.

1480
01:28:25,913 --> 01:28:29,872
He went away when I was born.

1481
01:28:29,917 --> 01:28:33,375
So the people at the institution
were your parents.

1482
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:34,910
Were they nice to you?

1483
01:28:34,955 --> 01:28:38,220
Some, yes. Some, no.

1484
01:28:38,258 --> 01:28:39,691
Did they hit you?

1485
01:28:39,727 --> 01:28:42,628
Sometimes they did hit me.
Yeah.

1486
01:28:42,663 --> 01:28:45,325
Like you hit Lucy's friend
at her birthday party?

1487
01:28:45,366 --> 01:28:47,027
Objection. Mistakes
the facts and evidence.

1488
01:28:47,067 --> 01:28:48,329
Nobody hit anybody.

1489
01:28:48,369 --> 01:28:50,337
I'll rephrase that.
Strong-armed.

1490
01:28:51,905 --> 01:28:55,432
So, who do you look up to?

1491
01:28:55,476 --> 01:28:56,841
Who do you want to be like...

1492
01:28:56,877 --> 01:29:00,210
as a father
when parenting Lucy?

1493
01:29:00,247 --> 01:29:02,477
The head of the institution?
The principal? The warden?

1494
01:29:02,516 --> 01:29:06,748
Not Mr. Whitehead. Not him.

1495
01:29:06,787 --> 01:29:08,550
Then who?

1496
01:29:11,759 --> 01:29:13,021
Who?

1497
01:29:15,529 --> 01:29:18,987
Myself.

1498
01:29:19,033 --> 01:29:23,766
I look up to myself as a father.

1499
01:29:23,804 --> 01:29:29,037
Mr. Dawson, you have
the capacity of a 7-year-old.

1500
01:29:29,076 --> 01:29:31,806
What makes you think you have
the ability to be a father?

1501
01:29:31,845 --> 01:29:33,403
Your background, your IQ...

1502
01:29:33,447 --> 01:29:35,210
your friends
who can't even testify--

1503
01:29:35,249 --> 01:29:37,717
Objection.
Compound questions.

1504
01:29:37,751 --> 01:29:39,446
-Objection!
-Sustained.

1505
01:29:39,486 --> 01:29:41,477
They love Lucy, see.

1506
01:29:41,522 --> 01:29:44,980
Even if Rita didn't think
they were smart enough...

1507
01:29:45,025 --> 01:29:47,858
to testify, they love Lucy.

1508
01:29:47,895 --> 01:29:50,455
Yeah. I love Lucy.

1509
01:29:50,497 --> 01:29:53,295
Even if Rita thought
you'd wipe the floor with them.

1510
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:55,961
Mr. Dawson,
your lawyer just objected.

1511
01:29:56,003 --> 01:29:58,403
You didn't have to answer
that question.

1512
01:29:58,439 --> 01:29:59,599
You can't even follow
simple rules...

1513
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,403
you've been observing
day after day.

1514
01:30:01,442 --> 01:30:03,603
-Objection. Your Honor--
-Overruled.

1515
01:30:03,644 --> 01:30:07,136
What makes you think
you can raise a 7-year-old?

1516
01:30:07,181 --> 01:30:08,944
A 10-year-old? A 13-year-old?

1517
01:30:08,982 --> 01:30:10,540
You know what that means?

1518
01:30:10,584 --> 01:30:14,418
She'll be six years
more advanced than you.

1519
01:30:15,622 --> 01:30:17,419
What makes you think
you can do that?

1520
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:21,918
What makes you think
you can do that?

1521
01:30:21,962 --> 01:30:23,452
What makes you think
you can do that?

1522
01:30:26,366 --> 01:30:29,631
I...

1523
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:33,902
have had a lot
of time, see, to...

1524
01:30:33,941 --> 01:30:36,307
think about what it is...

1525
01:30:36,343 --> 01:30:40,336
that makes somebody
a good parent...

1526
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:44,578
and it's about constancy...

1527
01:30:44,618 --> 01:30:46,745
and it's about...

1528
01:30:51,325 --> 01:30:55,887
patience,
and it's about listening...

1529
01:30:55,929 --> 01:30:59,490
and it's about
pretending to listen...

1530
01:30:59,533 --> 01:31:03,629
even when
you can't listen anymore.

1531
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:07,197
And it's about love,
like she said.

1532
01:31:07,241 --> 01:31:10,369
See, Billy has a home with me...

1533
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:13,641
and I made it the best I could.

1534
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,341
And it's not perfect...

1535
01:31:15,382 --> 01:31:18,579
and I'm not a perfect parent...

1536
01:31:18,619 --> 01:31:21,850
and sometimes I don't have
enough patience...

1537
01:31:21,889 --> 01:31:25,825
and I forget
he's just a little kid...

1538
01:31:25,859 --> 01:31:30,023
but we built a life
together...

1539
01:31:30,063 --> 01:31:32,861
and we love each other.

1540
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:35,596
And if you destroy that...

1541
01:31:35,636 --> 01:31:40,938
it'll be irre--irrep--

1542
01:31:40,974 --> 01:31:42,498
Let me see. Let me see.

1543
01:31:48,649 --> 01:31:50,708
-Irreparable.
-Yep!

1544
01:31:50,751 --> 01:31:51,911
Yes. Yes.

1545
01:31:51,952 --> 01:31:54,318
Joanne, don't do that, please.

1546
01:31:54,354 --> 01:31:56,879
Don't do it twice.
Not to him.

1547
01:31:56,924 --> 01:32:00,826
Meryl Streep can't even look
at Dustin Hoffman after that.

1548
01:32:03,864 --> 01:32:05,491
"Kramer vs. Kramer."

1549
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:09,899
Thank you, Mr. Wali,
for that commentary.

1550
01:32:09,937 --> 01:32:13,566
Your Honor, my client
is understandably upset.

1551
01:32:13,607 --> 01:32:14,665
Motion to recess.

1552
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:17,836
I don't exactly
like recess very much.

1553
01:32:17,878 --> 01:32:20,108
Motion denied.

1554
01:32:20,147 --> 01:32:22,047
Continue with your witness,
Mr. Turner.

1555
01:32:22,082 --> 01:32:24,482
Mr. Dawson...it's hard.

1556
01:32:24,518 --> 01:32:28,420
I know it's hard to know what
to say to Lucy half the time.

1557
01:32:28,455 --> 01:32:30,889
Right? ls it?

1558
01:32:30,924 --> 01:32:32,186
No.

1559
01:32:32,226 --> 01:32:34,524
No? Was that a no?

1560
01:32:34,561 --> 01:32:36,461
No what?

1561
01:32:36,496 --> 01:32:38,555
Let me see.

1562
01:32:40,934 --> 01:32:43,402
I don't know exactly.

1563
01:32:43,437 --> 01:32:45,132
I'm sorry, Mr. Dawson.
You don't know what?

1564
01:32:45,172 --> 01:32:47,470
I don't...yeah.

1565
01:32:47,507 --> 01:32:48,804
OK. Yeah.

1566
01:32:48,842 --> 01:32:50,139
Yes? Yes, you don't know.

1567
01:32:50,177 --> 01:32:52,372
Right? You don't know...

1568
01:32:52,412 --> 01:32:55,040
what it takes
to raise your daughter.

1569
01:32:55,082 --> 01:32:56,106
Objection.

1570
01:32:56,149 --> 01:32:58,117
These are not questions.
This is an attack.

1571
01:32:58,151 --> 01:32:59,118
Overruled.

1572
01:32:59,152 --> 01:33:01,950
I'm Lucy's father.

1573
01:33:01,989 --> 01:33:04,253
-I'm her father.
-Are you really?

1574
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:05,588
I'm not talking
about the fact...

1575
01:33:05,626 --> 01:33:07,924
that you got
some homeless woman pregnant.

1576
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:09,326
Objection, Your Honor!

1577
01:33:09,363 --> 01:33:12,230
Get to the question, Mr. Turner.

1578
01:33:12,266 --> 01:33:17,329
The question is,
if you love your daughter...

1579
01:33:17,371 --> 01:33:19,464
as much as you say you do--

1580
01:33:19,506 --> 01:33:21,770
and I know that you do--

1581
01:33:21,808 --> 01:33:24,174
don't you think
she deserves more?

1582
01:33:25,512 --> 01:33:26,570
Don't you
in your heart of hearts...

1583
01:33:26,613 --> 01:33:29,514
secretly question yourself
every day?

1584
01:33:29,549 --> 01:33:31,176
Objection. Compound questions.

1585
01:33:31,218 --> 01:33:33,152
OK, yeah!

1586
01:33:33,186 --> 01:33:34,585
I'm sorry. Was that a yes?

1587
01:33:34,621 --> 01:33:37,454
I think
Lucy deserves everything.

1588
01:33:37,491 --> 01:33:41,450
In my heart of hearts,
I think she deserves everything.

1589
01:33:41,495 --> 01:33:42,587
Yes, she does.

1590
01:33:42,629 --> 01:33:45,462
-Yeah, OK.
-Yes, she does.

1591
01:33:45,499 --> 01:33:47,524
And you agree
with everyone here...

1592
01:33:47,567 --> 01:33:50,934
that you can't give her that.

1593
01:33:50,971 --> 01:33:54,099
Maybe everybody's right, see.

1594
01:33:54,141 --> 01:33:57,269
Maybe everybody's right
about that, see.

1595
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:59,802
So no more now, OK?

1596
01:33:59,846 --> 01:34:04,010
No more now. No more.

1597
01:34:04,051 --> 01:34:09,887
I want to stop right now!

1598
01:34:09,923 --> 01:34:13,324
This is the end of this for me.

1599
01:36:49,316 --> 01:36:52,444
Your teacher told me
you're a wonderful artist.

1600
01:36:52,486 --> 01:36:55,319
So I was thinking maybe--

1601
01:36:55,355 --> 01:36:57,220
Daddy's coming today.

1602
01:36:58,792 --> 01:37:00,885
We're going to open
my birthday presents.

1603
01:37:00,927 --> 01:37:03,327
You must be so excited.

1604
01:37:03,363 --> 01:37:05,524
Why don't you just go
and do something?

1605
01:38:31,051 --> 01:38:34,578
Sam, it's me. Open up.

1606
01:38:34,621 --> 01:38:37,283
I don't have time for this.

1607
01:38:37,324 --> 01:38:40,725
You were supposed to show up
to your first evaluation...

1608
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,694
and I leave work early
to be there...

1609
01:38:42,729 --> 01:38:45,562
and where the hell are you?
Open the door!

1610
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,995
Sam, open the goddamn door.

1611
01:38:50,837 --> 01:38:53,465
If you don't care enough to
open the door, I'm out of here.

1612
01:38:53,506 --> 01:38:57,306
I've ruined my practice.
I've alienated my colleagues.

1613
01:38:57,344 --> 01:38:59,539
I sent my kid off on a fishing
trip with his father...

1614
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:01,069
so that I could work with you...

1615
01:39:01,114 --> 01:39:04,049
and you won't open
the goddamn door for me!

1616
01:39:04,084 --> 01:39:05,881
Fine! That's it! I've had it!

1617
01:39:29,042 --> 01:39:31,636
Sam, can I come in?

1618
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,448
Not really room here.

1619
01:39:38,485 --> 01:39:41,113
There's no room here.

1620
01:39:41,154 --> 01:39:45,215
Yeah, well, I lived
in the East Village.

1621
01:39:45,258 --> 01:39:46,657
I don't need a lot of room.

1622
01:39:46,693 --> 01:39:47,853
Because I make things--

1623
01:39:47,894 --> 01:39:50,454
everything is too hard
on everybody.

1624
01:39:50,497 --> 01:39:54,331
I make everything hard
on everybody.

1625
01:39:54,367 --> 01:39:56,267
I can go...

1626
01:39:58,271 --> 01:40:01,001
at least another nine rounds.

1627
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:02,531
But you gotta let me in.

1628
01:40:05,111 --> 01:40:07,875
Please. Sam.

1629
01:40:14,254 --> 01:40:15,482
There you are.

1630
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:21,718
Now I can see those kind eyes.

1631
01:40:23,897 --> 01:40:29,028
So, George says that
you needed a break from work.

1632
01:40:29,069 --> 01:40:32,470
I don't really want
to work there anymore...

1633
01:40:32,505 --> 01:40:34,132
because there's too many people.

1634
01:40:34,174 --> 01:40:41,410
Then maybe we can find you
a quieter job, because--

1635
01:40:41,448 --> 01:40:44,042
Remember that was one of
the judge's conditions...

1636
01:40:44,084 --> 01:40:45,415
that you earn more money.

1637
01:40:45,452 --> 01:40:48,080
You have to keep
earning more money...

1638
01:40:48,121 --> 01:40:49,918
so that you can
get a new apartment...

1639
01:40:49,956 --> 01:40:51,924
and Lucy can have
her own room...

1640
01:40:51,958 --> 01:40:53,550
for when you get her back.

1641
01:40:53,593 --> 01:40:57,791
Yeah, except that
Lucy doesn't need me anymore.

1642
01:40:57,831 --> 01:41:01,927
She has a new family now...

1643
01:41:01,968 --> 01:41:04,266
and she doesn't need me anymore.

1644
01:41:04,304 --> 01:41:05,464
Is that what she said?

1645
01:41:05,505 --> 01:41:08,030
It's because I know that.

1646
01:41:08,074 --> 01:41:10,406
Because I just know that.

1647
01:41:10,443 --> 01:41:12,843
Well.

1648
01:41:12,879 --> 01:41:15,541
That's the first stupid thing
I've ever heard you say.

1649
01:41:18,284 --> 01:41:21,378
Sam, you can get Lucy back.

1650
01:41:21,421 --> 01:41:24,822
The court favors reunification.

1651
01:41:24,858 --> 01:41:28,885
But, Sam,
you have to fight for her.

1652
01:41:28,928 --> 01:41:31,795
Yeah, but I tried!
I tried hard!

1653
01:41:31,831 --> 01:41:35,597
-Try harder!
-Yeah, but you don't know!

1654
01:41:35,635 --> 01:41:36,966
I don't know what?

1655
01:41:37,003 --> 01:41:39,301
You don't know
what it's like when you try...

1656
01:41:39,339 --> 01:41:43,776
and you try and you try
and you don't ever get there!

1657
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:48,770
Because you were born perfect,
and I was born like this!

1658
01:41:48,815 --> 01:41:50,339
And you're perfect!

1659
01:41:50,383 --> 01:41:51,611
Is that right?

1660
01:41:51,651 --> 01:41:54,279
-People like you don't know.
-People like me?

1661
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,153
You don't know what it's like
to get hurted...

1662
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:00,216
because you don't have feelings.

1663
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:04,060
People like you
don't feel anything.

1664
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:13,863
You think you got the market
cornered on human suffering?

1665
01:42:13,907 --> 01:42:16,205
Let me tell you something
about people like me.

1666
01:42:16,242 --> 01:42:23,307
People like me feel lost
and little and ugly...

1667
01:42:23,349 --> 01:42:25,840
and dispensable.

1668
01:42:25,885 --> 01:42:28,752
People like me have husbands...

1669
01:42:28,788 --> 01:42:33,782
screwing someone else
far more perfect than me.

1670
01:42:33,827 --> 01:42:38,526
People like me
have sons who hate them.

1671
01:42:41,935 --> 01:42:46,770
And I've screamed
horrible things to him...

1672
01:42:46,806 --> 01:42:48,740
a seven-year-old,
because he doesn't want...

1673
01:42:48,775 --> 01:42:52,006
to get in the car
at the end of the day.

1674
01:42:52,045 --> 01:42:57,950
And then he looks at me
with such anger...

1675
01:42:57,984 --> 01:43:02,216
and I hate him then.

1676
01:43:02,255 --> 01:43:05,850
I know I'm failing you.
I know I'm disappointing you.

1677
01:43:05,892 --> 01:43:09,419
I know you deserve better,
but get in the fucking car!

1678
01:43:14,534 --> 01:43:20,234
Every morning,
I wake up and I fail.

1679
01:43:20,273 --> 01:43:24,437
And I look around, and everybody
seems to be pulling it off...

1680
01:43:24,477 --> 01:43:28,573
but somehow I can't...

1681
01:43:28,615 --> 01:43:30,674
no matter how hard I try.

1682
01:43:32,986 --> 01:43:37,252
Somehow...l'll never be enough.

1683
01:43:37,290 --> 01:43:38,780
You're enough.

1684
01:43:38,825 --> 01:43:43,660
Yeah, you're much more
than enough.

1685
01:43:43,696 --> 01:43:45,664
Lovely Rita.

1686
01:44:19,065 --> 01:44:20,862
Get off the grass, Dino.

1687
01:44:26,139 --> 01:44:27,834
OK, come on.

1688
01:44:27,874 --> 01:44:31,332
Be careful,
because you're gonna get hurt.

1689
01:44:31,377 --> 01:44:33,811
Guys, be careful
of the pictures.

1690
01:44:33,846 --> 01:44:35,370
Be careful
of the pretty pictures.

1691
01:44:35,415 --> 01:44:36,382
Sam, you're early.

1692
01:44:36,416 --> 01:44:38,646
All the lights were green.

1693
01:44:38,685 --> 01:44:41,620
When I was walking here,
all the lights were green.

1694
01:44:41,654 --> 01:44:43,679
There's a reason
for the court schedule.

1695
01:44:43,723 --> 01:44:45,486
You stopped showing up.

1696
01:44:46,826 --> 01:44:49,522
Lucy's had to rebuild
her whole life, Sam.

1697
01:44:49,562 --> 01:44:52,622
I want her back.
I know I can get her back.

1698
01:44:52,665 --> 01:44:54,929
That's not up to me.

1699
01:44:54,968 --> 01:44:57,436
But I'm just gonna tell you...

1700
01:44:57,470 --> 01:44:59,267
I'm gonna do everything
in my power...

1701
01:44:59,305 --> 01:45:01,899
to protect that little girl
from getting hurt again.

1702
01:45:05,445 --> 01:45:07,879
Whose dogs are these?

1703
01:45:07,914 --> 01:45:10,109
These are supplemental income.

1704
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:14,950
Because I wash and I walk
and I feed the dogs.

1705
01:45:14,988 --> 01:45:18,583
Sam Dawson has everything
for your canine needs.

1706
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:22,052
Let me go get your daughter.

1707
01:45:23,229 --> 01:45:25,629
Everybody behave
like a gentleman...

1708
01:45:25,665 --> 01:45:28,361
because Lucy's
gonna come out here...

1709
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:32,030
and first impressions
are very important.

1710
01:45:35,942 --> 01:45:37,773
You never even came!

1711
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:40,278
You never called!

1712
01:45:40,313 --> 01:45:43,544
You forgot about me!
How could you forget me?

1713
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:46,814
No, I didn't forget you!
I would never forget you!

1714
01:45:46,853 --> 01:45:49,083
I hate you!

1715
01:45:49,122 --> 01:45:52,057
Will you not be mad at me
for one second?

1716
01:45:52,091 --> 01:45:55,185
Because I want to
tell you one thing, OK?

1717
01:45:55,228 --> 01:45:59,062
Because last night,
I was writing you a letter...

1718
01:45:59,098 --> 01:46:03,694
and then the words,
they got too big.

1719
01:46:03,736 --> 01:46:06,534
Gesundheit, Floppy.
Floppy has a cold.

1720
01:46:06,572 --> 01:46:08,733
And then I said...

1721
01:46:08,775 --> 01:46:13,371
"Dear Lucy, I'm sorry
I maybe hurt your feelings...

1722
01:46:13,413 --> 01:46:18,146
"and I was thinking
about you all the time.

1723
01:46:18,184 --> 01:46:21,585
"Lucy on a hammock...

1724
01:46:21,621 --> 01:46:23,213
"and Lucy at school...

1725
01:46:23,256 --> 01:46:26,987
"and Lucy in the sky
and kisses and hugs, Daddy.

1726
01:46:27,026 --> 01:46:30,325
"And P.S. I love you,
like the song.

1727
01:46:30,363 --> 01:46:33,730
"P.S. I love you,
like in the song."

1728
01:46:53,252 --> 01:46:55,083
Hello, Mr. Dawson.

1729
01:46:55,121 --> 01:46:58,750
Yeah. Hello, lawyer.

1730
01:47:02,462 --> 01:47:03,429
Shall we?

1731
01:47:03,463 --> 01:47:05,294
And in these next months...

1732
01:47:05,331 --> 01:47:08,494
Mr. Dawson will be expanding
his support system...

1733
01:47:08,534 --> 01:47:12,436
to include regional service
programs, tutors, and--

1734
01:47:12,472 --> 01:47:14,702
I think it's very important
that you know...

1735
01:47:14,741 --> 01:47:19,201
that the foster family is
pushing forward toward adoption.

1736
01:47:19,245 --> 01:47:22,112
The Department of Child
and Family Services and l...

1737
01:47:22,148 --> 01:47:24,378
fully support their request.

1738
01:47:29,989 --> 01:47:32,514
Darn it.

1739
01:47:32,558 --> 01:47:40,294
Sam, there's one option
we've never talked about.

1740
01:47:40,333 --> 01:47:43,393
I know what you went through...

1741
01:47:43,436 --> 01:47:45,927
the last time
you took the stand.

1742
01:47:45,972 --> 01:47:48,532
I didn't like that at all.

1743
01:47:48,574 --> 01:47:53,238
We could give the foster parents
guardianship...

1744
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:54,906
and then we could try...

1745
01:47:54,947 --> 01:47:57,745
for the most incredible
visitation rights...

1746
01:47:57,784 --> 01:48:01,720
and it would almost seem
like joint custody.

1747
01:48:04,557 --> 01:48:07,185
You're saying
I don't have a chance.

1748
01:48:07,226 --> 01:48:08,488
That's what you're saying.

1749
01:48:08,528 --> 01:48:10,621
No. I'm not saying
you don't have a chance.

1750
01:48:10,663 --> 01:48:15,066
That's what you said last time
and now look where he is.

1751
01:48:15,101 --> 01:48:17,968
But she's not saying
that I don't have a chance.

1752
01:48:18,004 --> 01:48:20,905
So tell me that I have a chance.

1753
01:48:23,676 --> 01:48:25,200
Oh, my God. Sam, you guys...

1754
01:48:25,244 --> 01:48:28,008
it's video night at my house,
and I'm not even there.

1755
01:48:28,047 --> 01:48:31,107
-Check.
-Sam, get your dessert to go.

1756
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:35,314
Because, OK.

1757
01:48:35,354 --> 01:48:38,152
Wait.
This is really hard to say.

1758
01:48:38,191 --> 01:48:41,183
For me, this is
a very hard thing to say...

1759
01:48:41,227 --> 01:48:44,890
but I'm gonna stay and have
my dessert here with Rita...

1760
01:48:44,931 --> 01:48:48,992
and I'm not gonna go
to video night tonight.

1761
01:48:50,102 --> 01:48:51,262
What?

1762
01:48:51,304 --> 01:48:53,329
Gee, that figures.
I knew that was coming.

1763
01:48:53,372 --> 01:48:55,203
Sam, you can go if you--

1764
01:48:55,241 --> 01:48:57,801
-I said no, Rita.
-But if you want to go--

1765
01:48:57,844 --> 01:48:59,141
Do you want me to go?

1766
01:48:59,178 --> 01:49:02,773
No, I don't want you to go,
but you can go if you want.

1767
01:49:09,155 --> 01:49:11,123
-Fine.
-Fine.

1768
01:49:12,258 --> 01:49:13,850
Good-bye, Rita.

1769
01:49:13,893 --> 01:49:17,886
If you want to come to
video night, you're welcome to.

1770
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:20,626
Thank you, Joe.

1771
01:49:20,666 --> 01:49:22,293
Bye, Joe.

1772
01:49:29,775 --> 01:49:33,711
Because you're eating slower.
That's good.

1773
01:49:33,746 --> 01:49:37,079
Because it's good to chew.

1774
01:49:37,116 --> 01:49:39,744
Buttermilk pancakes.

1775
01:49:39,785 --> 01:49:43,915
OK. Let me see.

1776
01:49:43,956 --> 01:49:46,982
OK, sidebar.

1777
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:56,163
Because you--
you need to leave your husband.

1778
01:50:02,108 --> 01:50:05,669
And I need to get Lucy back.

1779
01:50:11,951 --> 01:50:13,441
We need--

1780
01:50:13,486 --> 01:50:18,651
When dealing with the customer,
always be friendly...

1781
01:50:22,161 --> 01:50:24,493
and not familiar.

1782
01:50:28,534 --> 01:50:30,399
Because I can be your friend.

1783
01:50:36,309 --> 01:50:38,174
Thank you.

1784
01:50:40,646 --> 01:50:42,807
But you still need
to leave your husband.

1785
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:49,413
My marriage isn't so bad.

1786
01:50:53,659 --> 01:50:56,423
It's just that...

1787
01:50:56,462 --> 01:50:57,861
it's just...

1788
01:51:02,134 --> 01:51:04,796
I've never lost at anything.

1789
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:06,690
-Daddy?
-Hi.

1790
01:52:06,732 --> 01:52:07,699
What are you doing here?

1791
01:52:07,733 --> 01:52:09,701
I live here.

1792
01:52:09,735 --> 01:52:10,759
What do you mean you live here?

1793
01:52:10,803 --> 01:52:12,202
Actually, I live here.

1794
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:14,433
This is where you live?

1795
01:52:14,473 --> 01:52:16,100
So close to me?

1796
01:52:16,142 --> 01:52:18,736
Yeah, because I wanted
to be close.

1797
01:52:18,778 --> 01:52:21,303
I wanted to be closer to you...

1798
01:52:21,347 --> 01:52:25,408
so I live here
in that apartment.

1799
01:52:25,451 --> 01:52:26,850
It's number nine.

1800
01:52:26,886 --> 01:52:29,150
And number nine
is like October 9...

1801
01:52:29,188 --> 01:52:30,280
when John Lennon was born...

1802
01:52:30,322 --> 01:52:32,847
and his son was born
on October 9, too.

1803
01:52:32,892 --> 01:52:34,757
John met Yoko on November 9.

1804
01:52:34,794 --> 01:52:36,591
Yeah, and his mother lived...

1805
01:52:36,629 --> 01:52:40,725
at number nine Newcastle
in Liverpool.

1806
01:52:40,766 --> 01:52:43,166
Newcastle, nine letters.
Liverpool, nine letters.

1807
01:52:44,270 --> 01:52:48,070
Maybe I can talk to Daddy
for a minute?

1808
01:52:48,107 --> 01:52:49,734
Come over here, Dino.

1809
01:52:49,775 --> 01:52:52,869
You're a Girl Scout now!

1810
01:52:52,912 --> 01:52:54,277
Is that OK?

1811
01:52:54,313 --> 01:52:56,645
Yeah, that's really good.

1812
01:52:56,682 --> 01:52:57,944
Look at my pins.

1813
01:52:57,983 --> 01:53:01,578
-It looks very good on you.
-Thank you.

1814
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:03,952
You'll be
a very good Girl Scout.

1815
01:53:03,989 --> 01:53:05,752
Sam, we need to talk.

1816
01:53:05,791 --> 01:53:07,315
What are you doing?

1817
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:09,554
Trying to get closer to her
by moving closer?

1818
01:53:09,595 --> 01:53:11,893
We're supposed
to give her consistency.

1819
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:13,694
We've got a week
till we go to court.

1820
01:53:17,303 --> 01:53:23,902
Because every time I came down
to see her on a bus...

1821
01:53:23,943 --> 01:53:26,810
I was always every time
wasting time on a bus.

1822
01:53:26,846 --> 01:53:29,178
I really do understand.

1823
01:53:29,215 --> 01:53:32,343
But we have to make it about her
and what's best for her.

1824
01:53:32,384 --> 01:53:34,818
Yeah, what's best for her
is what's most important.

1825
01:53:34,854 --> 01:53:37,288
-Right.
-Yeah.

1826
01:53:37,323 --> 01:53:38,915
Does Floppy still have his cold?

1827
01:53:38,958 --> 01:53:41,984
Yeah, but Floppy's
getting much better.

1828
01:53:42,027 --> 01:53:43,119
That's good.

1829
01:53:43,162 --> 01:53:45,960
Can I buy some cookies from you?

1830
01:53:45,998 --> 01:53:49,490
That'll be 3.25.

1831
01:53:49,535 --> 01:53:50,832
We can get it
from you later.

1832
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:53,065
We really should get going.

1833
01:53:53,105 --> 01:53:55,335
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1834
01:53:55,374 --> 01:53:57,740
Can I hug her bye-bye?

1835
01:53:57,776 --> 01:53:59,767
Of course you can hug her.

1836
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:06,177
Good-bye.

1837
01:54:06,218 --> 01:54:09,585
Really very good to see you.

1838
01:55:11,283 --> 01:55:13,649
Daddy!

1839
01:55:13,686 --> 01:55:15,381
Did you know
that Warren G. Harding...

1840
01:55:15,421 --> 01:55:19,255
was the 29th president
of the United States?

1841
01:55:19,291 --> 01:55:22,158
Remember, the 29th president...

1842
01:55:22,194 --> 01:55:24,685
in case the judge asks.

1843
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:26,197
What are you doing out here?

1844
01:55:26,232 --> 01:55:27,563
I missed you.

1845
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:30,364
You could get really hurted.

1846
01:55:30,402 --> 01:55:31,699
And it's really cold...

1847
01:55:31,737 --> 01:55:34,706
and you don't have enough on
to keep you warm.

1848
01:55:35,908 --> 01:55:37,398
What--?

1849
01:55:37,443 --> 01:55:41,607
She couldn't sleep,
so she came to my house.

1850
01:55:41,647 --> 01:55:44,844
Give me my daughter.
Give us Lucy. Come here.

1851
01:55:44,883 --> 01:55:48,011
Easy, Sam.
Thank you.

1852
01:55:48,053 --> 01:55:50,521
Sometimes
if you rub her belly...

1853
01:55:50,556 --> 01:55:53,184
and then if you
tell her two stories...

1854
01:55:53,225 --> 01:55:56,922
and give her half
an IHOP corn muffin...

1855
01:55:56,962 --> 01:55:58,896
then sometimes she sleeps.

1856
01:55:58,931 --> 01:56:00,592
When she can't sleep.

1857
01:56:00,633 --> 01:56:04,194
We'll be fine, Sam.
Good night.

1858
01:56:04,236 --> 01:56:06,295
Good night.

1859
01:56:06,338 --> 01:56:08,806
You can go home now.

1860
01:56:29,261 --> 01:56:32,094
Yeah, a personal
pepperoni pan pizza.

1861
01:56:32,131 --> 01:56:33,894
That's a wonderful choice.

1862
01:56:48,714 --> 01:56:50,375
Daddy?

1863
01:56:53,152 --> 01:56:54,380
Daddy?

1864
01:57:21,347 --> 01:57:23,076
Lucy, come here.

1865
01:57:26,652 --> 01:57:28,517
Hi, sweetie.

1866
01:57:28,554 --> 01:57:30,954
I made us a midnight snack.

1867
01:57:30,989 --> 01:57:32,980
Half an IHOP corn cake.

1868
01:57:35,527 --> 01:57:37,995
I understand that
you want to see your daddy.

1869
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:43,163
And I really don't want
to keep you from him.

1870
01:57:43,202 --> 01:57:45,466
I really honestly don't.

1871
01:57:45,504 --> 01:57:48,132
I want you to know that.

1872
01:57:48,173 --> 01:57:50,232
So whenever you want
to see him, you just tell me.

1873
01:57:50,275 --> 01:57:54,177
Any time you want
to see him is fine...

1874
01:57:54,213 --> 01:57:57,808
but we kind of need
to work it out first.

1875
01:57:57,850 --> 01:57:59,215
So how about a snack?

1876
01:58:06,892 --> 01:58:08,257
Thank you.

1877
01:58:08,293 --> 01:58:09,658
Good night.

1878
01:58:09,695 --> 01:58:11,287
Good night.

1879
01:58:22,307 --> 01:58:25,174
Everybody behave yourself.

1880
01:58:28,347 --> 01:58:30,212
Oh, how wonderful.
You brought Willy.

1881
01:58:30,249 --> 01:58:32,911
-Hi, Willy.
-Hi, Sam.

1882
01:58:32,951 --> 01:58:34,418
It's good to see you.

1883
01:58:35,654 --> 01:58:38,953
We have to close the door
because the dogs go out.

1884
01:58:46,064 --> 01:58:48,931
My husband left this
when he moved out.

1885
01:58:51,069 --> 01:58:53,594
Lovely Rita.

1886
01:58:53,639 --> 01:58:57,769
OK, let me see.

1887
01:58:57,810 --> 01:59:02,440
They're going to put Randy
on the stand tomorrow first...

1888
01:59:02,481 --> 01:59:04,449
and then you.

1889
01:59:06,552 --> 01:59:09,146
They're a very nice couple.

1890
01:59:09,188 --> 01:59:12,123
And she's pretty,
and they have a nice house...

1891
01:59:12,157 --> 01:59:14,148
and she's smart, too.

1892
01:59:14,193 --> 01:59:18,391
Sam, I worry.
I worry sometimes.

1893
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:24,234
Do you worry
that you did something wrong?

1894
01:59:31,777 --> 01:59:33,074
I worry that I've gotten...

1895
01:59:33,111 --> 01:59:35,602
more out of this relationship
than you.

1896
01:59:49,228 --> 01:59:54,996
I have the lawyer
that never loses.

1897
01:59:55,033 --> 01:59:57,661
That's me.

1898
02:00:00,272 --> 02:00:04,231
And the manager at
the Pizza Hut's gonna testify...

1899
02:00:04,276 --> 02:00:05,607
and that's good.

1900
02:00:05,644 --> 02:00:07,111
Absolutely.

1901
02:00:10,249 --> 02:00:16,711
And Annie said
that George thinks--

1902
02:00:16,755 --> 02:00:18,382
that George Harrison
couldn't--

1903
02:00:18,423 --> 02:00:22,325
maybe, he couldn't
write a song...

1904
02:00:22,361 --> 02:00:26,263
but then he wrote
"Here Comes the Sun"...

1905
02:00:26,298 --> 02:00:34,103
and she said that it was one of
the best songs on "Abbey Road."

1906
02:00:36,942 --> 02:00:39,843
George was always
my favorite Beatle.

1907
02:01:02,334 --> 02:01:05,633
She's OK. Sorry.

1908
02:01:05,671 --> 02:01:07,263
She fell asleep in the car.

1909
02:01:08,874 --> 02:01:17,111
I was gonna turn back
and tuck her in...in her room.

1910
02:01:17,149 --> 02:01:21,313
You know, that l--
in her room that I made for her.

1911
02:01:23,455 --> 02:01:26,686
Because I tried to make
a really nice room for her.

1912
02:01:26,725 --> 02:01:29,023
But I was afraid
she'd wake up at our house...

1913
02:01:31,063 --> 02:01:33,588
and want to come home.

1914
02:01:36,568 --> 02:01:38,001
That's a girl.

1915
02:01:47,412 --> 02:01:51,280
I have to apologize to you...

1916
02:01:51,316 --> 02:01:55,275
because I was gonna
tell that judge...

1917
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:59,780
that I could give Lucy
the kind of love she never had.

1918
02:01:59,825 --> 02:02:03,989
But I can't say that,
because I'd be lying.

1919
02:02:05,497 --> 02:02:07,795
I hope...

1920
02:02:07,833 --> 02:02:12,930
I hope you're saying
what I think you're saying.

1921
02:02:12,971 --> 02:02:16,065
I hope you're saying
what I think you're saying.

1922
02:02:17,476 --> 02:02:18,773
I am.

1923
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,011
Bye.

1924
02:02:26,118 --> 02:02:27,915
I'll see you in court tomorrow.

1925
02:02:29,855 --> 02:02:31,880
Save me a seat, Sam.

1926
02:02:31,923 --> 02:02:34,824
On your side. OK?

1927
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:39,763
Yeah. I'll save you a seat
on my side.

1928
02:02:39,798 --> 02:02:41,993
-Bye.
-Bye.

1929
02:02:43,802 --> 02:02:46,430
Randy?

1930
02:02:46,471 --> 02:02:49,065
If I tell you a secret...

1931
02:02:49,107 --> 02:02:52,907
that I can't do it by myself...

1932
02:02:52,944 --> 02:02:54,673
will you tell the judge on me?

1933
02:02:56,415 --> 02:02:57,609
No, Sam.

1934
02:02:59,151 --> 02:03:00,846
Promise?

1935
02:03:00,886 --> 02:03:02,444
I promise.

1936
02:03:04,923 --> 02:03:10,452
Because I always wanted
Lucy to have a mother.

1937
02:03:10,495 --> 02:03:12,793
I always wanted her
to have a mother.

1938
02:03:12,831 --> 02:03:16,323
Help. I need somebody.

1939
02:03:16,368 --> 02:03:20,668
Help. Not just anyone.

1940
02:03:23,909 --> 02:03:27,845
And you're the red
in her painting.

1941
02:03:27,879 --> 02:03:31,178
Because I think
you're the red in her painting.

1942
02:03:40,092 --> 02:03:41,650
Thank you, Sam.

1943
02:04:07,986 --> 02:04:09,510
Play ball!

1944
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:13,621
Get it, Lucy!

1945
02:04:19,131 --> 02:04:20,462
Go, Lucy!

1946
02:04:32,811 --> 02:04:34,574
Lucy got a goal!

1947
02:04:39,117 --> 02:04:41,585
Lucy got a goal, Rita!
