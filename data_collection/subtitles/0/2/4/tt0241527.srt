1
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:27,070
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,460
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:46,965
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:52,429
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:55,891
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:00,062
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:05,484
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:28,465
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:32,552
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:37,224
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,519
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:43,397
There you go.

13
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,365
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:58,829
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,041
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

16
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:08,213
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:10,173
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:14,678
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,891
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:37,409
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,756
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,925
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:14,488
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,617
Now!

25
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:35,676
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:52,150
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:57,155
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:02,327
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:05,455
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:10,669
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,007
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:20,679
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,099
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:28,186
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

35
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,897
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:35,485
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:43,076
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,206
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,918
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:55,172
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,674
Get in.

42
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,267
Make it move.

43
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,646
Move!

44
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:14,358
- Move!
- He's asleep!

45
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:17,110
He's boring.

46
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:20,989
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:24,910
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

48
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:29,289
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,711
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:41,259
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:43,136
Do you...?

52
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:47,474
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,895
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:54,398
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:01,989
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:07,202
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:32,310
Thanks.

58
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,937
Anytime.

59
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,192
Snake!

60
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:58,003
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:01,381
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:06,970
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,147
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,818
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

65
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:25,906
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

66
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:33,121
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:12,577
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,998
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

69
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:18,959
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,786
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:09,801
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

72
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,349
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:43,085
Fine day, Sunday.

74
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,382
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

75
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,011
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

76
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,972
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,311
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

78
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:06,858
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:19,162
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

80
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,884
Make it stop, please!

81
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:36,596
Stop it!

82
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:43,687
Mummy, what's happening?

83
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:51,445
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,824
Get off!

85
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,749
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,586
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:11,923
Far away, where they can't find us!

88
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,385
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

89
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:52,589
Make a wish, Harry.

90
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:10,732
Who's there?

91
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,330
Sorry about that.

92
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:36,800
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:42,514
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

94
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:51,231
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

95
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,986
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:56,194 --> 00:13:59,031
I'm not Harry.

97
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:04,578
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

98
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,955
Got something for you.

99
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:12,753
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:18,675
Baked it myself, words and all.

101
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:25,265
Thank you.

102
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:29,645
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

103
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:48,955
Excuse me, but who are you?

104
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:54,086
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:58,048
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

106
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:03,553
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,180
Learned what?

108
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,933
You're a wizard, Harry.

109
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,186
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

110
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:14,439
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

111
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,567
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:20,779
...I can't be a wizard.

113
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:26,201
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:31,289
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:36,169
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:55,689
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:59,151
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

118
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:04,323
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:08,744
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:12,039
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:15,959
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:22,132
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:26,511
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

124
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,390
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,351
A freak!

126
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,520
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

127
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:41,443
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

128
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:46,657
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:50,869
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:55,415
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:59,544
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,214
He'll not be going.

133
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,759
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:06,968
Muggle?

135
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:11,306
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:15,394
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:21,525
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:26,530
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:31,284
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:33,537
...in front of me.

141
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:56,685
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:56,935 --> 00:18:01,023
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

143
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,319
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,703
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

145
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:32,304
"All students must be equipped with...

146
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,432
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,438
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

148
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,274
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,860
If you know where to go.

150
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:12,594
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

151
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:16,682
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,977
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

153
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:23,772
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

154
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:31,530
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:36,076
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:41,790
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:44,543
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

158
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:49,756
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:52,384
Oh, nice to meet you.

160
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,721
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,559
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

162
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:05,647
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,607
Goodbye.

164
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,905
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

165
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:17,576
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:21,580
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:42,351
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,203
Here, you get your quills and ink.

169
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:05,374
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:32,484
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:36,571
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:40,117
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:48,417
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,004
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

175
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:57,718
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:14,359
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

177
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:19,823
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:21,992
Best stay close.

179
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,708
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,090
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,261
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:46,933
Ha! There's the little devil.

183
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:50,020
And there's something else as well.

184
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:54,608
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:58,654 --> 00:23:03,742
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:06,995
Very well.

187
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:15,045
Vault 687.

188
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:19,257
Lamp, please.

189
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,101
Key, please.

190
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:56,294
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:01,299
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

192
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:05,679
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,472
Stand back.

194
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:38,545
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,891
I still need a wand.

196
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:54,519
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:24:55,228 --> 00:25:00,359
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

198
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:20,170
Hello?

199
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:24,966
Hello?

200
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,766
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

201
00:25:40,565 --> 00:25:42,776
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:48,865
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:57,833
Here we are.

204
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:08,969
Give it a wave.

205
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:17,978
Apparently not.

206
00:26:25,402 --> 00:26:27,612
Perhaps...

207
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:31,450
...this.

208
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:43,128
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,970
I wonder...

210
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:23,460
Curious.

211
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:26,588
Very curious.

212
00:27:26,797 --> 00:27:29,925
Sorry, but what's curious?

213
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:34,930
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

214
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:37,891
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,813
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

216
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,316
Just one other.

217
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:50,862
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:27:51,113 --> 00:27:56,785
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,832
And who owned that wand?

220
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,085
We do not speak his name.

221
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:09,047
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

222
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:12,259
It's not always clear why.

223
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:16,138
But I think it is clear...

224
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:20,267
...that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:24,730
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

226
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,649
...did great things.

227
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:29,860
Terrible...

228
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,572
...yes, but great.

229
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:41,246
Harry! Harry!

230
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,999
Happy birthday.

231
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:54,634
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:00,599
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:04,436
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

234
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:12,861
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,614
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:18,325
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:23,538
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V...

238
00:29:23,747 --> 00:29:27,376
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:29,461
No, I can't spell it.

240
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,924
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

241
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:40,138
It was dark times, Harry.

242
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:45,560
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

243
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:49,147
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

244
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:53,652
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

245
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:57,823
Your parents fought against him.

246
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:01,827
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

247
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,792
Nobody, not one.

248
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:11,378
Except you.

249
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,509
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:22,139
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

251
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:28,186
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

252
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:32,024
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,528
Well, some say he died.

254
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:39,156
Codswallop, in my opinion.

255
00:30:39,364 --> 00:30:42,617
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

256
00:30:42,826 --> 00:30:45,787
...too tired to carry on.

257
00:30:45,996 --> 00:30:51,418
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:55,922
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:30:56,381 --> 00:31:00,052
You're the boy who lived.

260
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:12,105
What are you looking at?

261
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:15,859
Blimey, is that the time?

262
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:20,072
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

263
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,160
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:30,707
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

265
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:35,837
"Platform 93/4"?

266
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:40,842
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 93/4.

267
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:44,388
There's no such thing, is there?

268
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,491
Sorry.

269
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,745
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:32:08,954 --> 00:32:10,497
On your left.

271
00:32:10,747 --> 00:32:14,543
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 93/4?

272
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:17,295
Think you're being funny, do you?

273
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:20,841
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

274
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:24,678
- Muggles?
- Platform 93/4, this way.

275
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,520
All right, Percy, you first.

276
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:44,698
Fred, you next.

277
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:48,618
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

278
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:50,787
I'm sorry, George.

279
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,336
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

280
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,719
Excuse me.

281
00:33:06,803 --> 00:33:09,598
Could you tell me how to...?

282
00:33:09,806 --> 00:33:13,352
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

283
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,021
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:22,152
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:25,822
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

286
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:27,676
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:30,095
Not at all.

288
00:34:33,181 --> 00:34:35,600
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:38,478
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:41,898
So it's true!

291
00:34:42,107 --> 00:34:44,901
I mean, do you really have the...?

292
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:48,363
- The what?
- The scar?

293
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,744
Wicked!

294
00:34:56,204 --> 00:35:01,376
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:07,716
We'll take the lot.

296
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:23,231
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

297
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:27,027
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:31,073
...spinach, liver and tripe.

299
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:35,452
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:45,462
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:35:45,671 --> 00:35:51,134
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:54,930
Watch it!

303
00:35:56,932 --> 00:36:00,727
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:07,526
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

305
00:36:09,277 --> 00:36:10,821
Hey, he's gone!

306
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:14,491
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

307
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:18,245
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

308
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:19,621
A little.

309
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,166
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,419
Yeah.

311
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:33,802
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:36,847
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

313
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:41,768
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

314
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:47,149
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

315
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:50,485
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

316
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:58,869
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

317
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:02,331
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:05,167
...but they've all worked for me.

319
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:10,839
For example:

320
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:14,009
Oculus Reparo.

321
00:37:16,094 --> 00:37:18,722
That's better, isn't it?

322
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,810
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

323
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:27,606
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

324
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:31,526
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

325
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:36,823
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:44,414
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:37:44,623 --> 00:37:46,583
Just there.

328
00:37:58,929 --> 00:38:02,724
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

329
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:08,146
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

330
00:38:15,153 --> 00:38:18,115
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

331
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,537
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

332
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:11,043
Wicked.

333
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:41,448
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:39:41,657 --> 00:39:45,661
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:50,916
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:54,252
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

337
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:58,924
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:04,388
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

339
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:08,517
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:12,854
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:40:13,063 --> 00:40:18,360
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,903
Trevor!

343
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,455
Sorry.

344
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:34,626
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:39,297
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:42,342
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:43,969
Harry Potter?

348
00:40:44,594 --> 00:40:47,264
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:49,766
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,436
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:40:54,396 --> 00:40:57,983
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:03,989
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:08,952
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:12,956
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:41:13,165 --> 00:41:15,334
I can help you there.

356
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:21,381
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

357
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:29,222
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:52,329
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:55,540
I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.

360
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:11,640
Will you wait along here, please?

361
00:42:13,058 --> 00:42:15,852
Now, before we begin...

362
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:19,314
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:24,319
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

364
00:42:24,695 --> 00:42:26,822
The first years, please note...

365
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:33,120
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:38,875
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:43,714
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:48,218
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:51,555
Thank you.

370
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:57,394
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

371
00:42:57,602 --> 00:43:01,231
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,651
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,487
Hermione Granger.

374
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,367
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

375
00:43:12,743 --> 00:43:16,121
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

376
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:25,464
Right, then. Right.

377
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:29,259
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,854
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,611
Slytherin!

380
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,490
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:54,242
Susan Bones.

382
00:44:02,793 --> 00:44:04,920
Harry, what is it?

383
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,881
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

384
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:09,549
Let's see...

385
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,137
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:18,308
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:37,160
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:40,163
Gryffindor!

389
00:44:46,378 --> 00:44:48,880
Harry Potter.

390
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,943
Difficult, very difficult.

391
00:45:10,152 --> 00:45:14,114
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

392
00:45:14,323 --> 00:45:16,616
There's talent, oh, yes.

393
00:45:16,825 --> 00:45:20,662
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:45:20,871 --> 00:45:23,040
But where to put you?

395
00:45:23,623 --> 00:45:26,126
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

396
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:30,005
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

397
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:35,093
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

398
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:40,641
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

399
00:45:40,974 --> 00:45:45,604
No? Well, if you're sure.

400
00:45:45,812 --> 00:45:47,564
Better be...

401
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:49,733
...Gryffindor!

402
00:46:15,258 --> 00:46:18,053
Your attention, please.

403
00:46:20,097 --> 00:46:22,808
Let the feast begin.

404
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:41,284
I'm half and half.

405
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:44,746
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:48,458
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:53,255
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

408
00:46:53,588 --> 00:46:56,717
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:46:56,925 --> 00:46:58,844
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

410
00:46:59,052 --> 00:47:04,641
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

411
00:47:09,146 --> 00:47:11,481
Hello! How are you?

412
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:15,110
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:47:25,203 --> 00:47:27,706
It's the Bloody Baron!

414
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:35,130
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:40,761
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:46,725
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:49,686
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

418
00:47:49,895 --> 00:47:53,398
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:47:53,732 --> 00:47:55,692
Like this.

420
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:09,539
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:14,086
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

422
00:48:14,336 --> 00:48:17,673
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:22,052
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:48:31,186 --> 00:48:36,984
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

425
00:48:37,192 --> 00:48:39,861
That picture's moving.

426
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,573
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

427
00:48:45,325 --> 00:48:47,661
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

428
00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:50,414
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,015
Password?

430
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:11,268
Caput Draconis.

431
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:22,904
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

432
00:49:25,615 --> 00:49:28,035
Gather around here.

433
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:33,040
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:49:33,248 --> 00:49:37,669
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

435
00:49:37,878 --> 00:49:41,006
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:50,826
Made it!

437
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:55,455
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:50:58,709 --> 00:51:03,672
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

439
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,176
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

440
00:51:08,385 --> 00:51:11,596
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

441
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:17,561
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:51:25,736 --> 00:51:31,408
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:35,245
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:51:35,495 --> 00:51:39,207
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:42,502
However, for those select few...

446
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:46,757
...who possess the predisposition...

447
00:51:50,427 --> 00:51:53,722
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,850
...and ensnare the senses.

449
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,603
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:05,734
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,660
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

452
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:20,832
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:24,002
...to not pay attention.

454
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,552
Mr. Potter.

455
00:52:33,762 --> 00:52:37,599
Our new celebrity.

456
00:52:39,768 --> 00:52:45,565
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:51,238
You don't know? Let's try again.

458
00:52:51,446 --> 00:52:56,076
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:52:57,369 --> 00:52:58,745
I don't know, sir.

460
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:02,874
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:07,671
I don't know, sir.

462
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:10,048
Pity.

463
00:53:11,758 --> 00:53:15,971
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

464
00:53:16,722 --> 00:53:19,516
...is it, Mr. Potter?

465
00:53:21,685 --> 00:53:27,316
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

466
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:30,068
Eye of rabbit...

467
00:53:30,402 --> 00:53:33,071
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:53:33,322 --> 00:53:38,035
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

469
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,668
Mail's here.

470
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,912
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:54:25,832 --> 00:54:28,043
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

472
00:54:28,251 --> 00:54:33,757
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:37,469
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:41,181
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:45,060
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:51,024
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

477
00:54:51,233 --> 00:54:56,947
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

478
00:54:57,155 --> 00:55:01,410
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,089
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

480
00:55:14,298 --> 00:55:17,092
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:20,846
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:24,975
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:30,772
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

484
00:55:30,981 --> 00:55:32,941
Up!

485
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:34,151
Up.

486
00:55:35,652 --> 00:55:37,487
Up.

487
00:55:39,156 --> 00:55:40,782
Up. Up!

488
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:42,993
With feeling.

489
00:55:51,668 --> 00:55:53,795
Shut up, Harry.

490
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:58,675
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

491
00:55:58,884 --> 00:56:02,888
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:08,226
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

493
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:12,272
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

494
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:16,777
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:20,155
On my whistle. Three, two...

496
00:56:22,574 --> 00:56:23,950
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,458
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

498
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:32,918
Neville!

499
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:39,299
Come back down this instant!

500
00:57:08,286 --> 00:57:10,664
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:18,380
Is he all right?

502
00:57:18,755 --> 00:57:24,428
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

503
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:30,392
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,271
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:57:34,479 --> 00:57:39,735
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

506
00:57:39,943 --> 00:57:41,862
Did you see his face?

507
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:45,907
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:57:46,116 --> 00:57:48,618
Give it here, Malfoy.

509
00:57:49,453 --> 00:57:53,165
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:57:57,336 --> 00:57:59,796
How about on the roof?

511
00:58:00,964 --> 00:58:04,801
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:11,141
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:14,269
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

514
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:16,480
What an idiot.

515
00:58:19,816 --> 00:58:23,362
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,697
Is that so?

517
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:31,119
Have it your way, then.

518
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,489
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

519
00:59:07,698 --> 00:59:09,741
Harry Potter!

520
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:12,703
Follow me.

521
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:26,633
You wait here.

522
00:59:28,385 --> 00:59:33,682
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:35,726
Yes, of course.

524
00:59:41,398 --> 00:59:47,154
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

525
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:52,743
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:55,203
I always knew he'd do well.

527
00:59:55,662 --> 00:59:59,708
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

528
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:04,421
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.

529
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,257
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
01:00:07,466 --> 01:00:09,968
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:13,889
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
01:00:14,097 --> 01:00:16,767
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

533
01:00:16,975 --> 01:00:20,937
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
01:00:21,146 --> 01:00:23,899
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
01:00:24,149 --> 01:00:29,780
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

536
01:00:29,988 --> 01:00:33,200
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

537
01:00:33,617 --> 01:00:38,413
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
01:00:46,964 --> 01:00:50,801
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
01:00:51,635 --> 01:00:53,845
I didn't know.

540
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:02,938
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
01:01:03,146 --> 01:01:05,440
Who doesn't?

542
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:08,485
What's happening?

543
01:01:08,694 --> 01:01:12,906
The staircases change, remember?

544
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:22,833
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

545
01:01:30,465 --> 01:01:33,885
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
01:01:34,136 --> 01:01:36,263
We're not supposed to be here.

547
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:40,392
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

548
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,145
Let's go.

549
01:01:45,355 --> 01:01:48,233
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

550
01:01:52,029 --> 01:01:55,365
Quick, let's hide through that door!

551
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:02,539
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

552
01:02:02,748 --> 01:02:04,916
Move over!

553
01:02:05,876 --> 01:02:08,003
Alohomora.

554
01:02:08,879 --> 01:02:10,797
Get in.

555
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:13,133
Alohomora?

556
01:02:13,342 --> 01:02:15,886
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

557
01:02:16,094 --> 01:02:19,473
Anyone here, my sweet?

558
01:02:25,729 --> 01:02:26,730
Come on.

559
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:30,067
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

560
01:02:30,317 --> 01:02:33,945
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

561
01:02:59,638 --> 01:03:05,102
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:08,981
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:03:09,189 --> 01:03:13,360
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:03:13,568 --> 01:03:16,446
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:20,325
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:03:20,534 --> 01:03:24,079
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

567
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:28,250
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

568
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:32,087
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:03:32,296 --> 01:03:35,424
Or worse, expelled.

570
01:03:38,677 --> 01:03:42,931
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:03:47,561 --> 01:03:51,773
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:03:51,982 --> 01:03:57,696
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:04:02,784 --> 01:04:06,913
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

574
01:04:07,122 --> 01:04:13,086
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:04:13,295 --> 01:04:17,674
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:04:17,883 --> 01:04:22,346
I think so. What are those?

577
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,808
You better take this.

578
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:39,655
Careful now, it's coming back.

579
01:04:46,244 --> 01:04:49,873
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:05:06,515 --> 01:05:08,809
What was that?

581
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:13,313
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:17,025
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:05:20,612 --> 01:05:25,200
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,953
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:31,164
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

586
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:35,377
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:05:35,585 --> 01:05:37,546
What do I do with it?

588
01:05:37,754 --> 01:05:41,008
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:05:41,258 --> 01:05:43,719
You catch this, the game's over.

590
01:05:43,927 --> 01:05:47,889
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

591
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:02,279
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:06,450
...or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:06:06,658 --> 01:06:09,077
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:06:09,328 --> 01:06:14,458
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:18,003
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:06:18,545 --> 01:06:24,176
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

597
01:06:24,885 --> 01:06:29,181
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

598
01:06:30,223 --> 01:06:32,726
Wingardium Leviosa.

599
01:06:32,976 --> 01:06:35,312
Wingardium Leviosa.

600
01:06:39,149 --> 01:06:43,403
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:06:43,654 --> 01:06:49,618
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

602
01:06:50,202 --> 01:06:54,414
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

603
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:58,752
Wingardium Leviosa.

604
01:07:06,259 --> 01:07:11,890
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:13,767
Splendid!

606
01:07:15,352 --> 01:07:17,562
Well done, dear.

607
01:07:21,775 --> 01:07:25,862
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:36,623
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

609
01:07:36,873 --> 01:07:42,212
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:07:42,879 --> 01:07:45,424
I think she heard you.

611
01:08:14,077 --> 01:08:16,163
Where's Hermione?

612
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:19,499
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:23,795
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

614
01:08:28,216 --> 01:08:31,887
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:08:32,137 --> 01:08:35,474
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:08:38,268 --> 01:08:40,604
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:08:47,486 --> 01:08:50,322
Silence!

618
01:08:51,907 --> 01:08:55,952
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,205
Now...

620
01:08:58,413 --> 01:09:02,960
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:09:03,669 --> 01:09:08,465
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:09:19,518 --> 01:09:22,688
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

623
01:09:22,896 --> 01:09:24,648
How could a troll get in?

624
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:30,028
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:34,241
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:09:46,336 --> 01:09:49,589
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

627
01:09:53,468 --> 01:09:55,637
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

628
01:10:26,668 --> 01:10:29,046
Hermione, move!

629
01:10:32,424 --> 01:10:36,553
Help! Help!

630
01:10:38,555 --> 01:10:40,641
Hey, pea brain!

631
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:54,946
Help!

632
01:11:16,093 --> 01:11:18,470
Do something!

633
01:11:19,888 --> 01:11:23,850
- What?
- Anything!

634
01:11:24,476 --> 01:11:26,895
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

635
01:11:27,104 --> 01:11:29,439
Wingardium Leviosa.

636
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:42,369
Cool.

637
01:12:06,768 --> 01:12:09,604
Is it dead?

638
01:12:09,813 --> 01:12:13,734
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:22,326
Troll boogers.

640
01:12:24,828 --> 01:12:28,373
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

641
01:12:28,582 --> 01:12:33,211
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

642
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:36,590
Miss Granger?

643
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:42,554
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:12:42,763 --> 01:12:44,640
But I was wrong.

645
01:12:44,848 --> 01:12:49,895
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

646
01:12:50,896 --> 01:12:55,317
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:12:55,525 --> 01:13:01,198
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:13:01,406 --> 01:13:04,409
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:13:04,618 --> 01:13:08,205
...for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:10,666
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:13:10,874 --> 01:13:14,294
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:13:14,503 --> 01:13:17,923
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:13:18,131 --> 01:13:20,759
...and live to tell the tale.

654
01:13:21,009 --> 01:13:23,428
Five points...

655
01:13:24,805 --> 01:13:27,933
...will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:32,604
...for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:13:38,193 --> 01:13:41,947
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:13:49,788 --> 01:13:52,541
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

659
01:13:52,749 --> 01:13:55,961
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:13:56,169 --> 01:13:58,380
I'm not hungry.

661
01:13:58,964 --> 01:14:04,594
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

662
01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:07,973
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

663
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:11,310
Even if it is against Slytherin.

664
01:14:18,984 --> 01:14:22,404
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

665
01:14:22,821 --> 01:14:26,950
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

666
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:29,828
...so he could get past that dog.

667
01:14:30,037 --> 01:14:32,789
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

668
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,250
But why would anyone go near that dog?

669
01:14:35,917 --> 01:14:39,171
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

670
01:14:39,379 --> 01:14:42,633
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

671
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:43,967
You're saying...

672
01:14:44,176 --> 01:14:48,680
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

673
01:15:01,818 --> 01:15:05,781
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

674
01:15:06,323 --> 01:15:07,866
Let's open it.

675
01:15:18,043 --> 01:15:19,294
It's a broomstick.

676
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:24,216
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

677
01:15:25,676 --> 01:15:27,719
But who...?

678
01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:51,868
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

679
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:55,747
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

680
01:15:55,956 --> 01:15:59,459
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

681
01:15:59,751 --> 01:16:02,421
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

682
01:16:02,629 --> 01:16:05,465
Woke up in hospital a week later.

683
01:16:27,654 --> 01:16:31,033
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

684
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:35,954
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

685
01:17:06,234 --> 01:17:08,695
The players take their positions...

686
01:17:08,904 --> 01:17:12,699
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

687
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:16,244
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

688
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:19,289
...from all of you!

689
01:17:24,419 --> 01:17:27,339
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

690
01:17:27,547 --> 01:17:30,258
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

691
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:34,262
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

692
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:44,523
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

693
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:08,005
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

694
01:18:13,176 --> 01:18:14,469
Well done!

695
01:18:18,849 --> 01:18:24,563
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

696
01:18:56,595 --> 01:18:59,389
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

697
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:15,072
Give me that!

698
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,147
Take that side!

699
01:20:38,613 --> 01:20:41,867
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

700
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:53,003
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

701
01:20:53,211 --> 01:20:57,591
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

702
01:21:19,363 --> 01:21:20,906
Come on, Hermione!

703
01:21:35,003 --> 01:21:38,757
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

704
01:21:45,847 --> 01:21:48,892
Fire! You're on fire!

705
01:22:06,743 --> 01:22:08,912
Go, go, go, go!

706
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:03,258
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

707
01:23:04,343 --> 01:23:05,802
He's got the Snitch!

708
01:23:06,011 --> 01:23:10,098
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

709
01:23:10,307 --> 01:23:11,975
Gryffindor wins!

710
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,815
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

711
01:24:00,023 --> 01:24:03,944
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

712
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:06,571
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

713
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:10,450
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

714
01:24:10,659 --> 01:24:15,956
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...

715
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:20,752
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

716
01:24:21,336 --> 01:24:25,340
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

717
01:24:25,549 --> 01:24:29,011
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

718
01:24:29,511 --> 01:24:34,599
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

719
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:38,395
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

720
01:24:38,603 --> 01:24:40,856
Exactly.

721
01:24:41,523 --> 01:24:44,276
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

722
01:24:44,484 --> 01:24:49,156
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

723
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:54,453
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

724
01:24:54,661 --> 01:24:56,079
Nicholas Flamel?

725
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,793
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

726
01:25:02,002 --> 01:25:06,089
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

727
01:25:06,298 --> 01:25:08,300
I don't know.

728
01:25:27,152 --> 01:25:29,988
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

729
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:33,033
Ring the Hogwart bell

730
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:36,036
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

731
01:25:36,244 --> 01:25:39,164
Cast a Christmas spell

732
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:56,098
Knight to e5.

733
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:05,941
Queen to e5.

734
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:12,990
That's totally barbaric!

735
01:26:13,615 --> 01:26:17,160
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

736
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:18,829
I see you haven't.

737
01:26:19,204 --> 01:26:24,334
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

738
01:26:24,543 --> 01:26:28,380
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

739
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:31,967
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

740
01:26:32,175 --> 01:26:35,679
We've looked a hundred times!

741
01:26:36,305 --> 01:26:41,560
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

742
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:46,690
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

743
01:26:49,234 --> 01:26:53,572
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

744
01:27:03,415 --> 01:27:06,752
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

745
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,171
What are you wearing?

746
01:27:09,755 --> 01:27:13,467
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

747
01:27:14,593 --> 01:27:17,012
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

748
01:27:24,436 --> 01:27:26,521
There they are.

749
01:27:37,532 --> 01:27:41,036
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

750
01:27:41,286 --> 01:27:45,415
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

751
01:28:02,224 --> 01:28:05,936
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

752
01:28:06,228 --> 01:28:09,147
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

753
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:15,862
My body's gone!

754
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:19,658
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

755
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,119
I'm invisible?

756
01:28:22,577 --> 01:28:26,999
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

757
01:28:27,457 --> 01:28:32,254
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

758
01:29:00,324 --> 01:29:06,204
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

759
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:12,252
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

760
01:29:31,063 --> 01:29:32,981
Who's there?

761
01:29:39,112 --> 01:29:44,743
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

762
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:55,879
Who is it? Show yourself.

763
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:44,428
Severus, I...

764
01:30:45,095 --> 01:30:48,974
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

765
01:30:49,182 --> 01:30:53,895
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

766
01:31:11,121 --> 01:31:14,333
We'll have another little chat soon.

767
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:20,005
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

768
01:31:20,255 --> 01:31:24,676
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

769
01:31:25,218 --> 01:31:30,265
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

770
01:33:02,357 --> 01:33:04,192
Mum?

771
01:33:07,446 --> 01:33:09,448
Dad?

772
01:33:44,191 --> 01:33:49,154
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

773
01:33:50,989 --> 01:33:53,867
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

774
01:33:54,076 --> 01:33:57,663
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

775
01:34:04,378 --> 01:34:08,674
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

776
01:34:10,133 --> 01:34:12,094
I only see us.

777
01:34:12,344 --> 01:34:15,681
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

778
01:34:15,889 --> 01:34:21,812
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

779
01:34:22,312 --> 01:34:24,648
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

780
01:34:24,898 --> 01:34:29,069
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

781
01:34:30,195 --> 01:34:32,656
I look good.

782
01:34:33,282 --> 01:34:37,119
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

783
01:34:37,327 --> 01:34:42,291
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

784
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:07,607
Back again, Harry?

785
01:35:10,694 --> 01:35:13,196
I see that you,
like many before you...

786
01:35:13,405 --> 01:35:17,576
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

787
01:35:17,909 --> 01:35:22,080
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

788
01:35:23,373 --> 01:35:25,917
Let me give you a clue.

789
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:28,587
The happiest man on earth...

790
01:35:28,795 --> 01:35:32,174
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

791
01:35:32,382 --> 01:35:34,718
...exactly as he is.

792
01:35:34,926 --> 01:35:39,973
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

793
01:35:40,182 --> 01:35:42,934
Yes. And no.

794
01:35:43,977 --> 01:35:46,438
It shows us nothing more or less...

795
01:35:46,647 --> 01:35:52,611
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

796
01:35:52,819 --> 01:35:57,532
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

797
01:35:57,741 --> 01:36:01,620
...you see them standing beside you.

798
01:36:01,828 --> 01:36:04,247
But remember this, Harry.

799
01:36:04,498 --> 01:36:10,379
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

800
01:36:10,587 --> 01:36:12,714
...or truth.

801
01:36:13,674 --> 01:36:19,721
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

802
01:36:20,764 --> 01:36:24,893
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

803
01:36:25,102 --> 01:36:27,020
And I must ask you...

804
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:31,858
...not to go looking for it again.

805
01:36:32,609 --> 01:36:35,737
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

806
01:36:36,321 --> 01:36:39,199
...and forget to live.

807
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:39,593
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

808
01:37:39,843 --> 01:37:42,929
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

809
01:37:43,138 --> 01:37:45,140
This is light?

810
01:37:49,728 --> 01:37:52,147
Of course! Here it is!

811
01:37:52,356 --> 01:37:56,360
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

812
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:57,778
The what?

813
01:37:58,445 --> 01:38:01,448
Honestly, don't you two read?

814
01:38:01,657 --> 01:38:06,161
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

815
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:08,997
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

816
01:38:09,206 --> 01:38:13,210
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

817
01:38:13,418 --> 01:38:15,587
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

818
01:38:15,796 --> 01:38:17,881
I know what it means!

819
01:38:18,757 --> 01:38:23,470
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

820
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:28,850
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

821
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,729
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

822
01:38:32,938 --> 01:38:37,651
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

823
01:38:54,418 --> 01:38:58,213
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

824
01:38:58,422 --> 01:39:01,133
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

825
01:39:05,846 --> 01:39:10,976
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

826
01:39:11,184 --> 01:39:13,979
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

827
01:39:14,354 --> 01:39:18,525
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

828
01:39:18,775 --> 01:39:19,860
What?

829
01:39:20,027 --> 01:39:23,447
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

830
01:39:23,655 --> 01:39:26,325
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

831
01:39:26,533 --> 01:39:30,412
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

832
01:39:30,621 --> 01:39:33,248
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

833
01:39:33,498 --> 01:39:36,543
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

834
01:39:36,752 --> 01:39:38,837
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

835
01:39:39,046 --> 01:39:42,716
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

836
01:39:42,966 --> 01:39:46,553
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

837
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:05,489
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

838
01:40:05,739 --> 01:40:07,741
I know what that is!

839
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:10,577
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

840
01:40:10,953 --> 01:40:14,206
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

841
01:40:14,414 --> 01:40:18,502
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

842
01:40:40,732 --> 01:40:42,943
Is that...

843
01:40:43,735 --> 01:40:44,903
...a dragon?

844
01:40:45,112 --> 01:40:49,533
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

845
01:40:49,741 --> 01:40:52,619
My brother works
with these in Romania.

846
01:40:52,828 --> 01:40:57,708
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

847
01:40:58,375 --> 01:41:00,127
Hello, Norbert.

848
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:04,756
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

849
01:41:05,507 --> 01:41:07,968
Don't you, Norbert?

850
01:41:14,933 --> 01:41:18,061
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

851
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:24,026
Who's that?

852
01:41:25,736 --> 01:41:27,821
Malfoy.

853
01:41:28,572 --> 01:41:29,990
Oh, dear.

854
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:36,496
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

855
01:41:36,705 --> 01:41:40,751
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

856
01:41:40,959 --> 01:41:45,047
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.

857
01:41:45,339 --> 01:41:47,507
Good evening.

858
01:41:51,136 --> 01:41:54,056
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

859
01:41:54,306 --> 01:41:57,809
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

860
01:41:58,018 --> 01:42:02,898
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

861
01:42:03,106 --> 01:42:05,442
- 50?!
- Each.

862
01:42:06,485 --> 01:42:08,862
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

863
01:42:09,071 --> 01:42:12,407
...all four of you
will receive detention.

864
01:42:13,325 --> 01:42:16,286
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

865
01:42:16,495 --> 01:42:18,830
I thought you said the four of us.

866
01:42:19,039 --> 01:42:21,541
No, you heard me correctly.

867
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:26,755
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

868
01:42:27,214 --> 01:42:30,175
You will join your classmates
in detention.

869
01:42:41,395 --> 01:42:45,399
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

870
01:42:45,607 --> 01:42:50,320
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

871
01:42:50,529 --> 01:42:53,365
God, I miss the screaming.

872
01:42:55,909 --> 01:42:59,204
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

873
01:42:59,413 --> 01:43:04,751
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

874
01:43:06,837 --> 01:43:09,798
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

875
01:43:11,258 --> 01:43:16,263
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

876
01:43:18,515 --> 01:43:20,600
Norbert's gone.

877
01:43:21,143 --> 01:43:24,688
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

878
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:28,233
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

879
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,736
What if he don't like Romania?

880
01:43:30,944 --> 01:43:35,198
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

881
01:43:35,824 --> 01:43:41,079
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

882
01:43:41,288 --> 01:43:43,665
Got to have your wits about you.

883
01:43:43,874 --> 01:43:49,546
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

884
01:43:50,005 --> 01:43:53,842
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

885
01:43:55,385 --> 01:43:56,637
...werewolves.

886
01:43:57,054 --> 01:44:00,349
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

887
01:44:00,557 --> 01:44:03,226
You can be sure of that.

888
01:44:05,187 --> 01:44:06,605
Nighty-night.

889
01:44:09,191 --> 01:44:12,027
Right. Let's go.

890
01:44:50,232 --> 01:44:52,651
Hagrid, what is that?

891
01:44:52,859 --> 01:44:56,238
What we're here for.
See that?

892
01:44:56,738 --> 01:45:02,119
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

893
01:45:02,661 --> 01:45:07,249
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

894
01:45:14,756 --> 01:45:20,512
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

895
01:45:20,721 --> 01:45:23,849
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

896
01:45:24,308 --> 01:45:27,602
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

897
01:45:28,854 --> 01:45:31,148
Okay. Then I get Fang.

898
01:45:31,315 --> 01:45:37,070
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

899
01:45:40,741 --> 01:45:45,746
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

900
01:45:45,954 --> 01:45:49,875
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

901
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:52,669
I'm not scared, Potter.

902
01:45:53,795 --> 01:45:55,756
Do you hear that?

903
01:45:58,300 --> 01:45:59,718
Come on, Fang.

904
01:45:59,926 --> 01:46:01,428
Scared!

905
01:46:26,411 --> 01:46:28,580
What is it, Fang?

906
01:47:38,942 --> 01:47:44,448
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

907
01:47:44,656 --> 01:47:48,660
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

908
01:47:48,869 --> 01:47:51,622
What was that thing you saved me from?

909
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:57,169
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

910
01:47:57,377 --> 01:48:02,924
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

911
01:48:03,133 --> 01:48:08,221
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

912
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:13,268
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

913
01:48:13,477 --> 01:48:15,270
A cursed life.

914
01:48:15,479 --> 01:48:19,441
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

915
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:24,613
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

916
01:48:24,947 --> 01:48:28,867
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

917
01:48:29,076 --> 01:48:34,247
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

918
01:48:35,082 --> 01:48:36,625
The Philosopher's Stone.

919
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,962
Harry!

920
01:48:40,545 --> 01:48:45,050
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

921
01:48:45,258 --> 01:48:47,427
You all right there, Harry?

922
01:48:48,553 --> 01:48:52,849
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

923
01:48:53,725 --> 01:48:57,562
You're safe now. Good luck.

924
01:49:05,195 --> 01:49:09,324
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

925
01:49:09,533 --> 01:49:12,327
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

926
01:49:12,536 --> 01:49:15,455
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

927
01:49:15,664 --> 01:49:20,043
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

928
01:49:20,252 --> 01:49:24,798
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

929
01:49:25,007 --> 01:49:26,591
He'll come back.

930
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,552
But if he comes back...

931
01:49:28,802 --> 01:49:32,764
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

932
01:49:33,765 --> 01:49:37,311
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

933
01:49:37,519 --> 01:49:41,106
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

934
01:49:41,315 --> 01:49:44,901
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

935
01:49:45,277 --> 01:49:50,157
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

936
01:49:50,907 --> 01:49:56,038
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

937
01:49:56,246 --> 01:50:00,292
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

938
01:50:06,048 --> 01:50:11,470
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

939
01:50:11,678 --> 01:50:15,349
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

940
01:50:15,557 --> 01:50:20,729
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

941
01:50:20,938 --> 01:50:23,607
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

942
01:50:23,815 --> 01:50:27,319
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

943
01:50:34,952 --> 01:50:37,412
- Of course!
- What is it?

944
01:50:37,621 --> 01:50:41,375
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

945
01:50:41,583 --> 01:50:44,670
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

946
01:50:44,878 --> 01:50:47,547
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

947
01:50:47,756 --> 01:50:50,008
Why didn't I see it before?

948
01:50:55,597 --> 01:50:59,101
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

949
01:50:59,309 --> 01:51:02,062
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

950
01:51:02,271 --> 01:51:04,856
You and this stranger
must have talked.

951
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,986
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

952
01:51:09,194 --> 01:51:13,198
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

953
01:51:13,407 --> 01:51:17,869
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

954
01:51:18,287 --> 01:51:22,457
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

955
01:51:22,666 --> 01:51:28,297
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

956
01:51:28,505 --> 01:51:33,969
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

957
01:51:35,595 --> 01:51:38,307
I shouldn't have told you that.

958
01:51:38,557 --> 01:51:40,767
Where are you going?

959
01:51:47,774 --> 01:51:50,527
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

960
01:51:50,986 --> 01:51:53,614
I'm afraid he's not here.

961
01:51:53,822 --> 01:51:58,118
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

962
01:51:58,535 --> 01:52:01,079
He's gone?
But this is important!

963
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:03,540
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

964
01:52:05,459 --> 01:52:09,171
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

965
01:52:09,796 --> 01:52:15,010
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

966
01:52:15,218 --> 01:52:19,514
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

967
01:52:27,814 --> 01:52:30,609
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

968
01:52:30,817 --> 01:52:33,487
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

969
01:52:33,695 --> 01:52:37,574
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

970
01:52:39,618 --> 01:52:42,704
What would three young Gryffindors...

971
01:52:42,955 --> 01:52:47,250
...be doing inside on a day like this?

972
01:52:52,005 --> 01:52:55,550
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

973
01:52:56,093 --> 01:52:58,053
People will think you're...

974
01:53:02,349 --> 01:53:05,060
...up to something.

975
01:53:15,362 --> 01:53:17,364
Now what do we do?

976
01:53:17,572 --> 01:53:21,326
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

977
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:36,550
Trevor.

978
01:53:36,883 --> 01:53:40,304
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

979
01:53:40,554 --> 01:53:45,976
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

980
01:53:46,184 --> 01:53:50,147
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

981
01:53:50,397 --> 01:53:54,985
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

982
01:53:55,193 --> 01:53:59,489
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

983
01:54:07,456 --> 01:54:11,251
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

984
01:54:11,501 --> 01:54:15,130
Brilliant, but scary.

985
01:54:15,797 --> 01:54:17,841
Let's go.

986
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:22,304
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

987
01:54:27,726 --> 01:54:31,688
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

988
01:54:35,567 --> 01:54:37,611
Alohomora.

989
01:54:49,623 --> 01:54:52,209
Wait a minute. He's...

990
01:54:53,418 --> 01:54:55,587
...snoring.

991
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:03,637
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

992
01:55:05,222 --> 01:55:08,225
It's got horrible breath.

993
01:55:10,811 --> 01:55:12,896
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

994
01:55:13,105 --> 01:55:14,523
Come on!

995
01:55:18,568 --> 01:55:20,654
Okay. Push.

996
01:55:43,802 --> 01:55:47,431
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

997
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:52,644
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

998
01:55:53,437 --> 01:55:56,898
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

999
01:55:57,608 --> 01:55:59,443
The harp.

1000
01:56:00,110 --> 01:56:02,821
It's stopped playing.

1001
01:56:12,873 --> 01:56:13,999
Jump!

1002
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:31,808
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1003
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:49,326
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1004
01:56:49,534 --> 01:56:53,246
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1005
01:56:53,455 --> 01:56:58,460
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1006
01:57:00,712 --> 01:57:02,047
Hermione!

1007
01:57:02,631 --> 01:57:06,426
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

1008
01:57:06,635 --> 01:57:11,139
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

1009
01:57:18,230 --> 01:57:21,566
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1010
01:57:21,775 --> 01:57:24,820
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

1011
01:57:25,028 --> 01:57:27,572
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

1012
01:57:27,781 --> 01:57:30,701
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1013
01:57:31,576 --> 01:57:35,414
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1014
01:57:35,622 --> 01:57:40,002
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1015
01:57:40,252 --> 01:57:42,296
Lumus Solem.

1016
01:57:50,387 --> 01:57:52,973
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

1017
01:57:55,684 --> 01:57:58,145
Lucky we didn't panic.

1018
01:57:58,895 --> 01:58:02,399
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1019
01:58:04,026 --> 01:58:05,527
What is that?

1020
01:58:05,736 --> 01:58:09,448
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1021
01:58:22,586 --> 01:58:26,048
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1022
01:58:26,256 --> 01:58:29,885
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1023
01:58:30,093 --> 01:58:33,555
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1024
01:58:37,017 --> 01:58:41,647
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

1025
01:58:47,527 --> 01:58:49,571
Strange.

1026
01:58:49,988 --> 01:58:52,282
Alohomora!

1027
01:58:55,243 --> 01:58:57,496
Well, it was worth a try.

1028
01:58:57,704 --> 01:59:00,958
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1029
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:05,087
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1030
01:59:05,295 --> 01:59:08,715
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1031
01:59:12,302 --> 01:59:14,638
What's wrong?

1032
01:59:15,514 --> 01:59:17,015
It's too simple.

1033
01:59:17,224 --> 01:59:21,979
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1034
01:59:22,187 --> 01:59:25,732
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1035
01:59:42,582 --> 01:59:45,585
This complicates things a bit.

1036
02:00:06,857 --> 02:00:08,775
Catch the key!

1037
02:00:13,196 --> 02:00:15,115
Hurry up!

1038
02:00:47,606 --> 02:00:52,277
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1039
02:00:52,486 --> 02:00:55,656
Where are we? A graveyard.

1040
02:00:56,031 --> 02:00:58,659
This is no graveyard.

1041
02:01:06,166 --> 02:01:09,086
It's a chessboard.

1042
02:01:21,056 --> 02:01:22,975
There's the door.

1043
02:01:35,028 --> 02:01:36,530
Now what do we do?

1044
02:01:36,905 --> 02:01:41,034
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1045
02:01:41,618 --> 02:01:45,372
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1046
02:01:45,706 --> 02:01:49,918
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1047
02:01:50,168 --> 02:01:54,214
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1048
02:02:01,388 --> 02:02:03,098
What happens now?

1049
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:06,893
Well, white moves first.

1050
02:02:07,102 --> 02:02:08,979
And then...

1051
02:02:10,731 --> 02:02:11,982
...we play.

1052
02:02:22,576 --> 02:02:27,623
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1053
02:02:27,873 --> 02:02:31,418
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1054
02:02:31,793 --> 02:02:34,755
You there, d5.

1055
02:02:49,353 --> 02:02:50,938
Yes, Hermione.

1056
02:02:51,146 --> 02:02:56,234
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1057
02:03:02,157 --> 02:03:04,660
Castle to e4!

1058
02:03:08,288 --> 02:03:10,582
Pawn to c3!

1059
02:03:55,210 --> 02:03:59,214
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

1060
02:03:59,464 --> 02:04:04,177
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1061
02:04:04,803 --> 02:04:07,139
Then you're free to check the king.

1062
02:04:07,347 --> 02:04:10,058
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

1063
02:04:10,684 --> 02:04:15,355
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

1064
02:04:15,564 --> 02:04:19,318
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1065
02:04:19,526 --> 02:04:23,113
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1066
02:04:23,614 --> 02:04:26,366
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1067
02:04:36,627 --> 02:04:39,546
Knight to h3.

1068
02:05:00,484 --> 02:05:02,486
Check.

1069
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:33,433
Ron!

1070
02:05:33,642 --> 02:05:39,439
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1071
02:05:54,496 --> 02:05:55,789
Checkmate.

1072
02:06:15,726 --> 02:06:18,228
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1073
02:06:18,437 --> 02:06:22,316
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1074
02:06:22,524 --> 02:06:24,401
I have to go on.

1075
02:06:24,901 --> 02:06:30,824
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1076
02:06:31,033 --> 02:06:33,535
Not as good as you.

1077
02:06:34,369 --> 02:06:39,207
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1078
02:06:40,417 --> 02:06:46,048
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1079
02:07:24,127 --> 02:07:25,796
You?

1080
02:07:26,588 --> 02:07:30,425
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

1081
02:07:30,634 --> 02:07:33,679
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1082
02:07:33,887 --> 02:07:37,015
Next to him, who would suspect...

1083
02:07:37,224 --> 02:07:41,144
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1084
02:07:41,353 --> 02:07:46,733
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1085
02:07:46,942 --> 02:07:49,736
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1086
02:07:50,237 --> 02:07:54,408
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1087
02:07:54,616 --> 02:07:56,827
...I would have succeeded.

1088
02:07:57,035 --> 02:08:00,038
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1089
02:08:00,247 --> 02:08:02,457
Snape was trying to save me?

1090
02:08:02,666 --> 02:08:08,005
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1091
02:08:08,213 --> 02:08:12,467
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

1092
02:08:12,676 --> 02:08:15,679
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1093
02:08:16,263 --> 02:08:21,226
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1094
02:08:22,144 --> 02:08:25,647
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1095
02:08:26,648 --> 02:08:31,903
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1096
02:08:32,112 --> 02:08:36,158
I'm never alone. Never.

1097
02:08:36,366 --> 02:08:40,454
Now, what does this mirror do?

1098
02:08:42,039 --> 02:08:44,166
I see what I desire.

1099
02:08:44,708 --> 02:08:49,129
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1100
02:08:49,338 --> 02:08:51,506
Use the boy.

1101
02:08:52,299 --> 02:08:56,219
Come here, Potter! Now!

1102
02:09:08,315 --> 02:09:12,319
Tell me, what do you see?

1103
02:09:37,469 --> 02:09:39,888
What is it? What do you see?

1104
02:09:40,097 --> 02:09:45,269
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1105
02:09:45,477 --> 02:09:47,020
He lies.

1106
02:09:47,521 --> 02:09:51,233
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1107
02:09:51,441 --> 02:09:55,821
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

1108
02:09:56,071 --> 02:10:00,075
I have strength enough for this.

1109
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:21,138
Harry Potter...

1110
02:10:21,346 --> 02:10:23,682
...we meet again.

1111
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:25,309
Voldemort.

1112
02:10:25,517 --> 02:10:29,479
Yes. You see what I've become?

1113
02:10:29,730 --> 02:10:33,317
See what I must do to survive?

1114
02:10:33,525 --> 02:10:37,654
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1115
02:10:38,322 --> 02:10:41,658
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1116
02:10:41,867 --> 02:10:45,537
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1117
02:10:45,746 --> 02:10:49,291
But there is something that can.

1118
02:10:49,499 --> 02:10:55,172
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1119
02:10:55,547 --> 02:10:57,090
Stop him!

1120
02:11:02,137 --> 02:11:04,890
Don't be a fool.

1121
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:08,518
Why suffer an horrific death...

1122
02:11:08,727 --> 02:11:12,356
...when you can join me and live?

1123
02:11:12,564 --> 02:11:13,649
Never!

1124
02:11:15,651 --> 02:11:20,447
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1125
02:11:21,198 --> 02:11:24,493
Tell me, Harry...

1126
02:11:24,743 --> 02:11:28,622
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1127
02:11:28,872 --> 02:11:30,958
Together...

1128
02:11:31,166 --> 02:11:33,710
...we can bring them back.

1129
02:11:34,127 --> 02:11:38,840
All I ask is for something in return.

1130
02:11:45,555 --> 02:11:48,684
That's it, Harry.

1131
02:11:49,559 --> 02:11:53,438
There is no good and evil.

1132
02:11:53,647 --> 02:11:56,650
There is only power...

1133
02:11:56,858 --> 02:12:00,988
...and those too weak to seek it.

1134
02:12:01,655 --> 02:12:06,702
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1135
02:12:07,119 --> 02:12:09,371
Just give me the Stone!

1136
02:12:11,999 --> 02:12:13,166
You liar!

1137
02:12:13,375 --> 02:12:15,502
Kill him!

1138
02:12:39,026 --> 02:12:44,364
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

1139
02:14:29,636 --> 02:14:32,139
Good afternoon, Harry.

1140
02:14:34,266 --> 02:14:38,770
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

1141
02:14:38,979 --> 02:14:44,985
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1142
02:14:45,193 --> 02:14:49,990
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1143
02:14:52,326 --> 02:14:55,954
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1144
02:14:56,163 --> 02:14:58,999
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1145
02:14:59,207 --> 02:15:02,210
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1146
02:15:02,419 --> 02:15:07,299
Fine. They're both just fine.

1147
02:15:07,883 --> 02:15:10,677
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

1148
02:15:11,011 --> 02:15:13,847
The Stone has been destroyed.

1149
02:15:14,097 --> 02:15:18,310
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1150
02:15:18,518 --> 02:15:22,481
...and agreed it was best all around.

1151
02:15:22,689 --> 02:15:26,526
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1152
02:15:28,570 --> 02:15:34,076
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1153
02:15:34,284 --> 02:15:37,496
But yes, he will die.

1154
02:15:37,704 --> 02:15:40,165
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1155
02:15:40,374 --> 02:15:42,918
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and...

1156
02:15:43,126 --> 02:15:47,214
You see, only a person...

1157
02:15:47,506 --> 02:15:51,426
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1158
02:15:51,677 --> 02:15:56,223
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1159
02:15:57,182 --> 02:16:00,686
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1160
02:16:00,894 --> 02:16:05,941
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1161
02:16:07,401 --> 02:16:12,614
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1162
02:16:12,823 --> 02:16:15,158
I'm afraid...

1163
02:16:16,576 --> 02:16:20,622
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1164
02:16:21,331 --> 02:16:23,917
Harry, do you know why...

1165
02:16:24,126 --> 02:16:28,130
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1166
02:16:28,338 --> 02:16:32,968
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1167
02:16:33,510 --> 02:16:36,722
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1168
02:16:36,930 --> 02:16:40,726
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1169
02:16:40,934 --> 02:16:45,856
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

1170
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:50,444
Love, Harry. Love.

1171
02:16:58,493 --> 02:17:02,623
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1172
02:17:02,831 --> 02:17:07,502
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1173
02:17:07,753 --> 02:17:11,048
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1174
02:17:11,256 --> 02:17:14,635
But I think I could be safe...

1175
02:17:14,843 --> 02:17:17,220
...with a nice toffee.

1176
02:17:21,308 --> 02:17:22,851
Alas!

1177
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:25,687
Earwax.

1178
02:17:40,911 --> 02:17:44,081
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

1179
02:17:45,207 --> 02:17:47,918
All right. Hermione?

1180
02:17:48,585 --> 02:17:50,420
Never better.

1181
02:18:06,228 --> 02:18:08,689
Another year gone.

1182
02:18:09,439 --> 02:18:13,986
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1183
02:18:14,194 --> 02:18:16,822
And the points stand thus:

1184
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:22,828
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1185
02:18:24,788 --> 02:18:30,460
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1186
02:18:35,757 --> 02:18:37,551
In second place...

1187
02:18:37,759 --> 02:18:42,556
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1188
02:18:48,228 --> 02:18:49,938
And in first place...

1189
02:18:50,272 --> 02:18:55,694
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1190
02:19:01,283 --> 02:19:03,493
Nice one, mate.

1191
02:19:07,331 --> 02:19:11,418
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1192
02:19:11,668 --> 02:19:15,964
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1193
02:19:16,173 --> 02:19:21,136
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1194
02:19:21,762 --> 02:19:27,267
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1195
02:19:27,476 --> 02:19:30,270
...while others were in grave peril...

1196
02:19:30,979 --> 02:19:33,231
...50 points.

1197
02:19:34,149 --> 02:19:35,442
Good job.

1198
02:19:43,158 --> 02:19:49,206
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1199
02:19:49,706 --> 02:19:54,962
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1200
02:19:59,591 --> 02:20:01,635
And third...

1201
02:20:02,177 --> 02:20:05,055
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1202
02:20:05,264 --> 02:20:09,559
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1203
02:20:10,143 --> 02:20:15,023
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1204
02:20:23,323 --> 02:20:25,242
We're tied with Slytherin!

1205
02:20:25,450 --> 02:20:31,456
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1206
02:20:31,665 --> 02:20:35,544
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1207
02:20:35,752 --> 02:20:38,714
I award 10 points...

1208
02:20:38,922 --> 02:20:42,134
...to Neville Longbottom.

1209
02:20:55,480 --> 02:20:58,900
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1210
02:20:59,109 --> 02:21:03,655
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1211
02:21:08,702 --> 02:21:12,080
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1212
02:21:50,118 --> 02:21:53,455
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1213
02:21:53,664 --> 02:21:57,960
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1214
02:22:03,382 --> 02:22:06,677
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

1215
02:22:12,933 --> 02:22:16,687
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1216
02:22:19,898 --> 02:22:21,733
This is for you.

1217
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:40,627
Thanks, Hagrid.

1218
02:22:46,466 --> 02:22:50,887
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1219
02:22:51,305 --> 02:22:55,767
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1220
02:22:56,018 --> 02:22:58,687
...you could always threaten him...

1221
02:22:58,895 --> 02:23:01,773
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1222
02:23:01,982 --> 02:23:07,070
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1223
02:23:07,529 --> 02:23:11,867
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1224
02:23:17,372 --> 02:23:20,500
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1225
02:23:20,709 --> 02:23:22,794
I'm not going home.

1226
02:23:23,003 --> 02:23:24,921
Not really.

1227
