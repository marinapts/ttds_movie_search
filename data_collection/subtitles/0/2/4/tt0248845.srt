1
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,492
Don't you know me,
Kansas City?

2
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,911
I'm the new
Berlin Wall.

3
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,455
Try and tear me down!

4
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,375
I was born
on the other side

5
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,712
Of a town
ripped in two

6
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,257
I made it over
the Great Divide

7
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,427
Now I'm coming
for you

8
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,182
Enemies
and adversaries

9
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,350
They try
and tear me down

10
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,229
You want me, baby,
I dare you

11
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,358
Try and tear me down

12
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,717
I rose from off
of the doctor's slab

13
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,136
Like Lazarus
from the pit

14
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,723
Now everyone wants
to take a stab

15
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,058
And decorate me

16
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,560
Blood, graffiti,
and spit

17
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,272
Enemies
and adversaries

18
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,234
They try
and tear me down

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,071
You want me, baby,
I dare you

20
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,199
Try and tear me down.

21
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,891
On August 13,
1961,

22
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,685
a wall
was erected

23
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,645
down the middle
of the city of Berlin.

24
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,107
The world was divided
by a cold war,

25
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,652
and the Berlin Wall was the most
hated symbol of that divide.

26
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,823
Reviled, graffiti'd,
spit upon.

27
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,200
We thought the wall
would stand forever.

28
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,035
And now
that it's gone,

29
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,330
we don't know
who we are anymore.

30
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,041
Ladies and gentlemen,
Hedwig is like that wall,

31
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,960
standing before you
in a divide

32
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,212
between East
and West.

33
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,214
Slavery
and freedom.

34
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,843
Man and woman.
Top and bottom.

35
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,304
And you can try
and tear her down,

36
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,472
but before you do,

37
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,266
you must remember
one thing!

38
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,521
Ain't much
of a difference

39
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,608
Between a bridge
and a wall

40
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,153
Without me right
in the middle, babe

41
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,863
Wow!

42
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,115
You would be
nothing at all

43
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,826
Enemies
and adversaries

44
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,747
They try
and tear me down

45
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,501
You want me, baby,
I dare you

46
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,546
Try and tear
me down

47
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,674
Enemies
and adversaries

48
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,219
They try
and tear me down

49
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,599
You me want me, baby,
I dare you

50
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,936
Try and
tear me down.

51
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,854
From East Berlin

52
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,731
to Junction City.

53
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,235
Hello, New York;
Hello, Missouri.

54
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,154
What? You wanna try
and tear me down?

55
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:51,917
Come on and tear-rrr--

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,378
Me down!

57
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,137
Hello...?

58
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,514
Where is everybody?

59
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,808
Out.

60
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,060
"Out"? Why are you
in such a mood?

61
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,564
I have been having
the most wonderful time with--

62
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,775
do you remember
that 45-year-old divorcee

63
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,153
with the hair
and the mean look?

64
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,740
She came up to me
after the show, and I thought,

65
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,117
"This lady wants
a piece of me."

66
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,660
So I didn't know
what to do.

67
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,787
I was alone,
I had nothing in my hand,

68
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,581
I was gonna go
for the eyes.

69
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,666
She came at me
from both sides, somehow,

70
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,878
and she just gave me
a fucking hug.

71
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,005
She gave me
a fucking hug.

72
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,007
Can you figure?

73
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,842
Can you fucking beat that?
She gave me--

74
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,345
I also got a few drinks
out of it as well,

75
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,681
which was not
a bad...

76
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,688
I was born
on the other side

77
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,066
Of a town
ripped in two

78
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,527
Made it over
the Great Divide

79
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,905
Now I'm coming
for you

80
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,365
Enemies
and adversaries...

81
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,950
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

82
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,743
Why can't we...

83
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,829
why don't you write
a new song?

84
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,000
You want me, baby,
I dare you

85
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,128
Try and tear me down...

86
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,132
Thank you,
my name is Hedwig.

87
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,135
Please welcome those ambassadors
of Eastern bloc rock,

88
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,512
The Angry Inch.
Here they are.

89
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,267
And my man Friday,

90
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,936
through Thursday,

91
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,646
Yitzhak, ladies
and gentlemen.

92
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,858
There's no need,
there's none.

93
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,569
Also very talented and so lucky
to be here, right, boys?

94
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,362
- Yeah.
- Yes, Miss Hedwig.

95
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,448
Look out, guys,
lmmigration!

96
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,074
I've got their passports
right here.

97
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,951
Ladies and gentlemen,

98
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,079
do you like the pelt?
I want you to be honest,

99
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,291
because some bitch
stopped me on the way in--

100
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,336
"What poor, unfortunate
creature had to die

101
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,755
for you to wear that?"

102
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,966
"My Aunt Trudy,"
I replied.

103
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,427
Just walked away.
Just walked away ladies and--

104
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,013
- Hedwig, can we eat dessert?
- What is it? Yes, you can.

105
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,182
I am thrilled,

106
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,768
you can join me for
the fabulous first night

107
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,271
of the St. Louis leg
of my world tour.

108
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,482
And when it comes
to huge openings,

109
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,776
a lot of people
think of me.

110
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,861
Many more of you,
though,

111
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,281
have only recently
become aware of me.

112
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,787
It took a character
assassination piece like this

113
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,956
to make you finally
pay attention.

114
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,792
But now you're
interested, huh?

115
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,544
Intrigued, even?

116
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,587
How did some...

117
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,133
slip of a girly-boy
from Communist East Berlin

118
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,679
become the internationally
ignored song stylist

119
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,723
barely standing
before you?

120
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,393
That's what I want to talk about
tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

121
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,895
I don't wanna talk
about sudden,

122
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:25,023
undeserved
commercial success.

123
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,484
I don't wanna talk
about betrayal,

124
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,237
I don't wanna talk
about my lawsuit

125
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,907
against a certain
rock and roll "icon,"

126
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,244
Tommy Gnosis,

127
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,830
who, by some freak
coincidence, is performing

128
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,167
right next door
at Busch Stadium.

129
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,129
And to whom I taught
everything he knows,

130
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,590
and has apparently
forgotten,

131
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,551
about rock & roll!

132
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,344
Yes, this is
Phyllis Stein,

133
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,930
manager of Hedwig
and the Angry Inch.

134
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,391
I've been ho--
"Inch"! Not "Itch."

135
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,185
Let me speak
to Brad, please.

136
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,729
You know I've been holding
for 24 minutes?

137
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,981
Yes, hi, Brad,
this is Phyllis.

138
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,150
So what's going on
with Bilgewater's?

139
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,320
You make
the baby cry.

140
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,572
I heard the entire
chain's going under.

141
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,867
Hold on,
hold on a second.

142
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,994
- Hedwig!
- We can have a gig

143
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,164
in any Bilgewater's nationwide
with a 24-hour notice?

144
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,917
And they know what kind
of music we play?

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,919
Brad, I love you.

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,754
Okay, ciao.

147
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,257
People, people,
people.

148
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,469
Tomorrow is
a travel day.

149
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,346
It's a travel day
for Tommy,

150
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,057
so it's a travel day
for us.

151
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,600
Friday, Chicago.

152
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,352
Tommy's
at Soldier Field,

153
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,770
and we're
at Bilgewater's

154
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,231
in the mall
down the street.

155
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,734
And the next day,
looks like he's...

156
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,403
basically, he's back
on the bus.

157
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,615
Phyllis--
"basically"?

158
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,200
He's doing
a record signing.

159
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,952
Why do you feel
the need to lie to me?

160
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,371
Hedwig, please.
Come.

161
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,128
I don't think it's going
to help our lawsuit

162
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,172
if you continue to--

163
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,259
if you present
the appearance of stalking.

164
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,344
You know I don't
like that word.

165
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,097
Please listen to me.
How about you don't talk to him,

166
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,890
and I get someone
to steal a photo

167
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,642
- of you two together?
- A photo--

168
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,310
You know some rag
will run it.

169
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,728
It'll really help
the lawsuit.

170
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,814
Proves you two
know each other.

171
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,399
Please,

172
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,609
Iet me do my job.
Please?

173
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,027
Okay.

174
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,904
I'm gonna make
some phone calls.

175
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,614
I'm gonna make
some phone calls!

176
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,533
All right.

177
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,326
Okay, everybody.
Bedski!

178
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,803
Ladies and gentlemen,

179
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,306
I recently found
my first diary.

180
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,559
Age 2-6.

181
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,978
EAST BERLIN 1968

182
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,523
It was fully illustrated.

183
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,026
As I unrolled the pages,

184
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:00,197
I realised that so many people
have touched me

185
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,242
on my way
to this stage tonight.

186
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:07,162
How can I say
who touched me the most?

187
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:10,624
My father,
the American Gl?

188
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,252
Could it have been
my East German mother?

189
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,213
...pervert!

190
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,469
Get out! Get out!

191
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:26,640
Go on... Go on!

192
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,955
When the earth
was still flat

193
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,667
And clouds
made of fire

194
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,712
And mountains
stretched up to the sky

195
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,548
Sometimes higher

196
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,678
Folks roamed the earth

197
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,513
Like big rolling kegs

198
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,474
They had
two sets of arms

199
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,977
They had
two sets of legs

200
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,274
They had two faces peering
out of one giant head

201
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,110
So they could watch
all around them

202
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,654
As they talked
while they read

203
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,239
And they never

204
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:27,117
Knew nothing of love

205
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:30,204
It was before

206
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,625
The origin of love

207
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,544
The origin of love

208
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,297
The origin of love

209
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,966
The origin of love

210
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,761
Now there was
three sexes then

211
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,932
One that looked like two men
glued up back-to-back

212
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,018
They called
the children of the sun

213
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,771
And similar
in shape and girth

214
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:58,148
Was the children
of the Earth

215
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:02,194
They looked like two girls
rolled up in one

216
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,781
And the children
of the moon

217
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,158
Looked like a fork
shoved on a spoon

218
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,868
They was part sun,
part earth

219
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,663
Part daughter, part son

220
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:17,417
Aah--

221
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:20,212
The origin of love

222
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,468
Now the gods
grew quite scared

223
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,512
Of our strength
and defiance

224
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,180
And Thor said

225
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,808
"I'm gonna kill 'em all
with my hammer

226
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,477
Like I killed
the giants"

227
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,229
ButZeus said

228
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,565
"No, you better
let me

229
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,025
Use my lightning
like scissors

230
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,695
Like I cut the legs
off the whales

231
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,030
Dinosaurs into lizards"

232
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,950
And then he grabbed up
some bolts

233
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,077
He let out a laugh

234
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,705
Said, "I'll split them
right down the middle

235
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,583
Gonna cut them
right up in half"

236
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:01,378
And the storm clouds
gathered above

237
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,173
Into great balls
of fire

238
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,057
And then fire

239
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,853
Shot down from the sky
in bolts

240
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,356
Like shining blades
of a knife

241
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,277
And they ripped
right through the flesh

242
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,905
Of the children
of the sun

243
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,324
And the moon
and the earth

244
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,743
And some lndian god

245
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,912
Sewed the wound up
into a hole

246
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,580
Pulled it round
to our bellies

247
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,876
To remind us
the price we pay

248
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,838
And Osiris,
and the gods of the Nile

249
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:49,384
Gathered up a big storm
to blow a hurricane

250
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,638
To scatter us away

251
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,973
In a flood
of wind and rain

252
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,351
A sea of tidal waves

253
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,062
To wash us all away

254
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,147
And if we don't behave

255
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,483
They'll cut us down again

256
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,194
And we'll be hopping around
on one foot

257
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,697
Looking through
one eye

258
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,846
The last time
I saw you

259
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,223
We'd just split
in two

260
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,475
You was looking
at me

261
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,520
I was looking
at you

262
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,939
You had a way
so familiar

263
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,649
I could not recognise

264
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,151
'Cause you had blood
on your face

265
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,445
I had blood
in my eyes

266
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:53,198
But I could swear
by your expression

267
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,284
That the pain
down in your soul

268
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,787
Was the same
as the one down in mine

269
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,915
That's the pain

270
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:06,044
That cuts a straight line
down through the heart

271
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,505
We call it love

272
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,508
We wrapped our arms
around each other

273
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,969
Tried to shove ourselves
back together

274
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,054
We was making love

275
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,807
Making love

276
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:23,020
It was a cold, dark evening
such a long time ago

277
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,773
When, by the mighty hand
of Jove

278
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,944
It was a sad story
how we became

279
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,155
Lonely two-legged
creatures

280
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,325
The story
of the origin of love

281
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:39,119
That's
the origin of love

282
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,538
Oh yeah

283
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,457
The origin of love

284
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,670
The origin of love

285
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:53,800
The origin of love.

286
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,656
It is clear that
I must find my other half,

287
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,909
but is it a he,
or a she?

288
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,329
What does this person
look like?

289
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,498
Identical to me?

290
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,793
Or somehow complementary?

291
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:34,883
Does my other half have
what I don't?

292
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,512
Did he get the looks?

293
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,180
The luck?

294
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,933
The love?

295
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,561
Were we really separated
forcibly,

296
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,480
or did he just run off
with the good stuff?

297
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,024
Or did l?

298
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,902
Will this person
embarrass me?

299
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,073
What about sex?

300
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,827
Is that how we put ourselves
back together again?

301
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:05,330
Or can two people...

302
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:08,333
actually become one...

303
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,586
again?

304
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:20,387
I remember once
when I was six years old

305
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,514
I was watching
my favourite cartoon

306
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,391
on American Forces
Network--

307
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,226
"Jesus Was Good."

308
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,480
Jesus said the darndest thing.

309
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,735
Don't you ever mention
that name to me again.

310
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,363
But he died for our sins.

311
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,073
So did Hitler.

312
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,786
Absolute power corrupts.

313
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,499
Absolutely.

314
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,792
Better to be powerless, my son.

315
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:59,593
In the year I was born,
The Wall went up.

316
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,849
And many people decided
to move west to freedom.

317
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,816
Mother threw me
into a wheelbarrow

318
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,527
and headed east.

319
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:19,738
The Communists
gave her a job

320
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,616
teaching sculpture
to limbless children.

321
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,580
Most of my time
was spent

322
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:31,291
Iistening
to American Forces Radio.

323
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,085
We are freaks

324
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,879
We follow the code of freaks
We are freaks!

325
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,090
We stand back
We are freaks

326
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,300
We do what we please
and do what we choose

327
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,010
We are bad...

328
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,474
Our apartment
was so small,

329
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,434
that mother made me play
in the oven.

330
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,145
One of us,
one of us...

331
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,488
Late at night,

332
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:06,034
I would listen to the voices
of the American masters:

333
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:10,080
Toni Tenille,
Debby Boone,

334
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:13,208
Anne Murray--
who was actually a Canadian,

335
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:16,336
working in
the American idiom.

336
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:20,799
And then there were
the crypto-homo rockers:

337
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,927
Lou Reed, lggy Pop,

338
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,722
David Bowie--
who was actually an idiom

339
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:30,184
working in America
and Canada.

340
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:32,978
These artists,

341
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,772
they left as deep
an impression on me

342
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,860
as that oven rack
did on my face.

343
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,363
To be a young American
in muskrat love,

344
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:46,200
soft as an easy chair,
not even the chair,

345
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,244
"I am," I said,
"Have I never been mellow?"

346
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,079
And the coloured girls sing...

347
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:54,333
Do, do-do, do-do,
do, do-do

348
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:58,378
Do, do-do, do-do,
do, do-do

349
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,923
Do, do-do, do-do

350
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:05,093
Do, do-do, do,
do-do, do-do...

351
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:11,350
But never
with the melody.

352
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:15,312
How could I do it better
than Toni or Lou?

353
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,149
"Hey, boy...

354
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,277
take a walk
on the wild side!"

355
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,289
By my side

356
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:38,168
You will be the one

357
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:41,922
Lying by my side

358
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:46,760
Lying by my side

359
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,308
Lying by my side.

360
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,911
Okay.

361
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,248
Okay.

362
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,719
One day,
in the late mid-80s...

363
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,890
I was in my
early late 20s,

364
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:35,726
I had just been dismissed
from university

365
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,061
after delivering
a brilliant lecture

366
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:41,023
on the aggressive influence
of German philosophy

367
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,275
on rock and roll,
entitled,

368
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:46,612
"You, Kant, Always
Get What You Want."

369
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:51,575
At 26, my academic career
was over,

370
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,619
I had never
kissed a boy,

371
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,704
and I was
still sleeping with Mom.

372
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,545
The search
for my other half

373
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,589
on my side of The Wall

374
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,841
had proved futile.

375
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,927
Might he be found
on the other?

376
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,597
But how to get over?
People died trying.

377
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:19,228
Such were the thoughts
flooding my tiny head,

378
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:23,899
on the day that
I was sunning myself...

379
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,486
in an old bomb crater

380
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,905
I had discovered
near The Wall.

381
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:31,406
I am naked,

382
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,285
face down on a piece
of broken church,

383
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:38,997
inhaling a fragrant
westerly breeze,

384
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,667
my God, I deserved
a break today.

385
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,886
Girl,

386
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,722
I sure don't mean
to annoy you.

387
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:02,145
My name is
Sergeant Luther Robinson.

388
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,107
My name is Hansel.

389
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,571
Luther is silent for a moment
as he stares at my...

390
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,698
"Iittle bishop
in a turtleneck."

391
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,912
Hansel?

392
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,460
Well, you must
like candy.

393
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,838
I like Gummi Baerchen.

394
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:41,602
The taste is completely
different from a Gummi Bear,

395
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,478
yet somehow familiar.

396
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,564
It's much sweeter
than a Gummi Bear.

397
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:46,899
Wow.

398
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,859
And softer, too.

399
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,944
I feel
so optimistic.

400
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:56,992
I suddenly recognised
the flavour in my mouth--

401
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,578
it's the taste
of power.

402
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,747
Damn, Hansel.

403
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,918
I can't believe
you're not a girl.

404
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,086
You're so fine.

405
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:13,467
Why don't you take
the whole bag?

406
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:19,014
He searches my face
for news of his fate.

407
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,271
His expression is echoed
in scores of tiny faces,

408
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,899
pressing against
clear plastic,

409
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,528
panting faces of every
imaginable colour,

410
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:36,073
creed,
and non-Aryan origin,

411
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,158
fogging up the bag

412
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,786
Iike the windows
of a Polish bathhouse.

413
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,832
I stumbled naked
through the ruins,

414
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:47,751
back towards blander,
less complicated confections,

415
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:51,004
Ieaving in my wake,
a trail of rainbow carnage.

416
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:57,261
Next day, Hansel follows
the trail back,

417
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:00,722
and on his way
finds a Milky Way,

418
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,433
a roll of Necco Wafers,

419
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,561
some Pop Rocks,

420
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:09,606
and a giant-sized Sugar Daddy
named Luther.

421
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:13,902
I've got
a sweet tooth

422
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:17,281
For licorice drops
and jelly rolls

423
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,786
Hey, sugar daddy

424
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,123
Hansel needs some sugar
in his bowl

425
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,087
I'll lay out fine china
on the linen

426
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:33,797
And polish up
the chrome

427
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,008
If you've got
some sugar for me

428
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:39,052
Sugar daddy,
bring it home

429
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:46,185
Oh, the thrill
of control

430
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:50,731
Like the rush
of rock and roll

431
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:54,484
It's the sweetest taste
I've known

432
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:59,239
If you've got some sugar,
bring it home.

433
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,325
Looks like we've got

434
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,410
some sugar daddies
in the house.

435
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:12,002
Honey bees
go shopping

436
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:14,171
It's something
to be seen.

437
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:17,466
You could give me
a cavity, honey.

438
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,344
They swarm
to wildflowers

439
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,471
Get nectar
for the queen.

440
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,307
I bet you could fill
that cavity, sweetie.

441
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,060
And everything
you bring me

442
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,021
Got me dripping
like a honeycomb

443
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,065
If you got
some sugar for me

444
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,318
Sugar daddy,
bring it home.

445
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,946
It's a car wash,
ladies and gentlemen.

446
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,783
Whoa, the thrill
of control

447
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,328
Like a blitzkrieg
on the roll

448
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,166
It's the sweetest taste
I've known

449
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,835
Oh yeah

450
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,420
If you've got some sugar,
bring it home

451
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,297
Ba-da ba-da do

452
00:29:57,381 --> 00:30:00,092
Come on, sugar daddy,
bring it home.

453
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,971
He loves me, Mother.

454
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,807
He wants to marry me...

455
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,728
and get me the hell
out of here.

456
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:29,872
Get my passport
and my camera, Hansel.

457
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,958
It's a simple
cut-and-paste job.

458
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,002
We change
the photo,

459
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:39,590
and you can use my name--
Hedwig Schmidt.

460
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,425
Not so simple,
ladies.

461
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:44,887
Baby...

462
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,557
you know
I love you.

463
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,893
I'm always
thinking of you.

464
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,188
But I gotta
marry you here,

465
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,023
in East Berlin.

466
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:58,942
And that means a full
physical examination.

467
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:02,404
They'd see right away
that I have a--

468
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,156
No, baby.

469
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,911
To walk away...

470
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:10,996
you gotta...

471
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,458
Ieave something
behind.

472
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,838
Am I right,
Mrs Schmidt?

473
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,965
I've always thought so,
Luther.

474
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:24,635
To be free,

475
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,930
one must give up
a little part of oneself.

476
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,390
And I know just
the doctor to take it.

477
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:49,201
My sex change operation
got botched

478
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,955
My guardian angel
fell asleep on the watch

479
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,792
Now all I've got
is a Barbie doll crotch

480
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,294
I've got an angry inch

481
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:02,047
Six inches forward,
five inches back

482
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,424
I got a--
I got an angry inch

483
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:08,637
Six inches forward
and five inches back

484
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,515
I got a--
I got an angry inch

485
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,853
I'm from the land where you
still hear the cries

486
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:19,231
I had to get out,
had to sever all ties

487
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,900
I changed my name
and assumed a disguise

488
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:25,070
I got an angry inch

489
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:28,157
Six inches forward,
five inches back

490
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,701
I got a--
I got an angry inch

491
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:34,580
Six inches forward,
five inches back

492
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:37,082
I got a--
I got an angry inch

493
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:42,129
Six inches forward,
five inches back

494
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,424
The train is coming
and I'm tied to the track

495
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,260
I try to get up,
I can't get no slack

496
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:50,345
I got an angry inch,
angry inch

497
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:54,224
My mother made my tits
out of clay

498
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:55,851
Tits out of clay

499
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,895
My boyfriend told me
that he'd take me away

500
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,396
Tits of clay

501
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,315
He dragged me
to the doctor one day

502
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:02,733
I've got an angry inch

503
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,862
Six inches forward,
five inches back

504
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:10,199
I got a motherfucking
angry inch

505
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:13,660
Six inches forward,
five inches back

506
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:16,371
I got a--
I got an angry inch

507
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:18,457
Long story short.

508
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,709
Yeah, long story short--

509
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,544
when I woke up
from the operation,

510
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,463
I was bleeding
down there.

511
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,924
I was bleeding from the gash
between my legs.

512
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,884
It's my first day
as a woman,

513
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,594
already it's that time
of the month.

514
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:33,263
But two days later,
the hole closed up.

515
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,725
The wound healed
and I was left...

516
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:40,187
With a one-inch
mound of flesh

517
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,981
Where my penis used to be,
where my vagina never was

518
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:45,984
It was a one-inch
mound of flesh

519
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:49,696
With a scar running down it
like a sideways grimace

520
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,907
On an eyeless face

521
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,992
- It was just a little bulge.
- Faggot!

522
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,245
It was an angry inch

523
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:59,540
Six inches forward,
five inches back

524
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:02,459
The train is coming
and I'm tied to the track

525
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:05,796
I try to get up,
I can't get no slack

526
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,841
I got an angry inch,
angry--

527
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:12,678
Six inches forward,
five inches back

528
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:16,223
Stay undercover till
the night turns to black

529
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,725
I got my inch,
I'm set to attack

530
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,979
I got an angry inch,
angry inch

531
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,607
Six inches forward,
five inches back

532
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:28,777
Stay undercover till
the night turns to black

533
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:31,822
I got my inch,
I'm set to attack

534
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,575
I got an angry inch,
angry inch

535
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:38,537
Six inches forward
and five inches back

536
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,874
The train is coming
and I'm tied to the track

537
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:44,751
I try to get up,
I can't get no slack

538
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:48,630
I got an angry inch,
angry inch

539
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:51,550
Six inches forward
and five inches back...

540
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:35,506
...champagne
flowing freely...

541
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,138
...all border crossings

542
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,807
are reported to be wide open,
and thousands are flooding

543
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,893
into the western half
of the city

544
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,729
to celebrate
their newfound freedom.

545
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:53,190
The Berlin Wall
has fallen,

546
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:56,235
and the world
will never be the same.

547
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:59,488
The Germans
are a patient people,

548
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:03,534
and good things come
to those who wait.

549
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,429
On nights

550
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,516
Like this

551
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:35,607
When the world's
a bit amiss

552
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:42,197
And the lights go down
across the trailer park

553
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,994
I get down

554
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,372
I feel had

555
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:56,587
Feel on the verge
of going mad

556
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:01,133
Then it's time
to punch the clock

557
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,760
I put on some makeup

558
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:07,890
Turn on the tape deck

559
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:13,270
And put the wig
back on my head

560
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:22,779
Suddenly I'm Miss Midwest
Midnight checkout queen

561
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:25,115
Until I head home

562
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:28,619
And I put myself
to bed

563
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,921
I look back
on where I'm from

564
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:43,884
Look at the woman
I've become

565
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:49,515
And the strangest things
seem suddenly routine

566
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:54,061
I look up from my vermouth
on the rocks

567
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:59,066
A gift-wrapped wig
still in the box

568
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:02,903
Of towering Velveteen

569
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:06,698
I put on some makeup

570
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:10,160
Some Lavern Baker

571
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:14,665
I'm pulling the wig
down from the shelf

572
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:23,882
Suddenly I'm
Miss Beehive 1963

573
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:29,304
Until I wake up
and I turn back to myself

574
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:40,315
Some girls
they got natural ease

575
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:45,279
They wear it
any way they please

576
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:47,823
With their
French flip curls

577
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:50,701
And perfumed
magazines

578
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:53,912
Wear it up

579
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,498
Let it down

580
00:40:56,582 --> 00:41:00,294
This is the best way
that I've found

581
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:03,922
To be the best
you've ever seen

582
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:06,425
I put on
some makeup

583
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,304
Turn on
the eight-track

584
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:15,642
I'm pulling the wig
down from the shelf

585
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:24,693
Suddenly I'm
Miss Farrah Fawcett from TV

586
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:27,279
Until I wake up

587
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:30,782
And I turn back
to myself

588
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:36,246
Shag, bi-level, bob,
Dorothy Hamill do

589
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,040
Sausage curls,
chicken wings

590
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:39,708
It's all because
of you

591
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,418
With your blow-dried
feather back

592
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,212
Toni Home Wave, too

593
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:44,671
Flip, 'fro,
frizz, flop

594
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:46,006
It's all because
of you

595
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,883
It's all because
of you

596
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:49,801
It's all because
of you

597
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,274
Okay, everybody!

598
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:24,002
Suddenly I'm
this punk rock star

599
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,380
Of stage and screen

600
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,257
And I ain't never

601
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,301
I'm never turning back

602
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:46,608
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

603
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,736
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

604
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,823
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

605
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:55,951
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

606
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:59,037
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

607
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:01,874
Do-do-do-do.

608
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,517
When the Earth
was still flat

609
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,437
And clouds
made of fire

610
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,731
The mountains
stretched

611
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:29,818
Up to the sky,
sometimes higher...

612
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,697
I am so sorry.

613
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,991
I was waiting
for the phone company.

614
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:41,497
God, is that
his new single?

615
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,669
Don't do it, sweetie!

616
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,671
Please don't say
anything to him today.

617
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,298
If you do,
he's got the power,

618
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,217
know what I mean?
He's got the power!

619
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,718
All we need
is a snapshot,

620
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,845
then they'll know
that you were responsible

621
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:59,389
for some of the biggest
hits of the millennium,

622
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:01,433
and you will be
so fucking rich!

623
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:05,103
Damn it, looks like
the photographer's already inside.

624
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,065
Everybody,
stay right here.

625
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:10,984
Hedwig, Hedwig,
Hedwig...

626
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,946
please don't
say anything.

627
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,781
Let me handle it.

628
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:27,501
- Phyllis Stein party.
- Who are you with?

629
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:29,878
We're A&R from A&M.

630
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,839
Actually, this is
a private event.

631
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,298
I'm sorry.

632
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,259
- Private event?
- Mm-hmm.

633
00:44:35,342 --> 00:44:37,678
As in, "You're not
on the list."

634
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:38,887
As in,
"Find it."

635
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,056
I'm looking,
and you know what?

636
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:42,474
It's not here.

637
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:44,768
- Justin!
- Get out of my fucking way!

638
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,895
Settle down.

639
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:49,773
- I could have your job!
- I don't think you could.

640
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,859
- Bitches!
- Where's my fucking brooch?

641
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:54,987
We're going to continue
to shadow Tommy's tour.

642
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,864
We're going to squeeze
the local press.

643
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:58,782
I do not want
to blow our wad

644
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:01,577
on my E! channel contact
until we get to New York.

645
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,205
It's all about
New York.

646
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,875
Honey, I've thought
about it,

647
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:10,002
I think it's a bad idea,
this photo-op.

648
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:11,837
It was your idea.

649
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,423
I'm second-guessing
myself now. I think...

650
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:15,674
I don't think
you should have

651
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:17,634
any personal contact
with Tommy.

652
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:20,179
- I guess we disagree.
- Honey, we do disagree,

653
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:21,930
- but please listen.
- Did you--

654
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:24,600
excuse me, did you put
a bra in a dryer?

655
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,728
What?

656
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:32,149
Did you put a bra
in a dryer?!

657
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,651
Yes.

658
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,737
How many times
do I have to tell you?

659
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,990
You don't put a bra
in a dryer!

660
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:41,700
It warps!

661
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:44,036
Hedwig, please,
it's a bra.

662
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:47,331
You can have
one of mine. Please!

663
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:30,290
You know,
ladies and gentlemen,

664
00:46:30,374 --> 00:46:32,209
the road is my home.

665
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:35,754
- My home, the road.
- Hear, hear.

666
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,840
And when I think
about all the people

667
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,925
I have come upon
in my travels,

668
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,760
I have to think
about the people

669
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:44,096
who have come
upon me.

670
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:47,057
Tommy, can you
hear me?

671
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,475
Yeah!

672
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,894
From this milkless tit,

673
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:53,480
you sucked

674
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:57,568
the very business
we call show!

675
00:47:05,117 --> 00:47:06,618
Okay.

676
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,245
You wanna know
about Tommy Gnosis?

677
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,205
Yeah!

678
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:12,624
Okay, I'll tell you
about Tommy Gnosis.

679
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:15,919
After my divorce,
I scraped by

680
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:19,798
with babysitting gigs
and odd jobs--

681
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:22,342
mostly the jobs
we call "blow."

682
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,305
I had lost my job
at the base PX,

683
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:28,348
and I had lost
my gag reflex.

684
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,267
You do the math.

685
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:35,898
I sat for the baby
of General Speck.

686
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:39,151
He was the commander
of the nearby army fort,

687
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,820
and his other son was...

688
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:45,991
the artist formerly known
as my buttboy.

689
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:49,620
We're talking about
Tommy Speck at this time.

690
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:52,998
Tommy Speck
was a 17-year-old

691
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:56,668
classic rock-loving,

692
00:47:56,752 --> 00:48:00,297
"Dungeons and Dragons"
obsessed,

693
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,717
Jesus freak

694
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,888
with a fish on his truck.

695
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:13,977
I found him
incredibly...

696
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,482
hot.

697
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:22,504
I had recently
returned

698
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:24,214
to my first love
of music.

699
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:26,675
I had tried singing once,
back in Berlin.

700
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:28,635
They threw tomatoes
after the show...

701
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,096
I had a nice salad.

702
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,932
But newly motivated,

703
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:37,352
I got myself
a cheap electric piano

704
00:49:37,436 --> 00:49:41,106
and I found a couple
of Korean sergeants' wives

705
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,484
who churned out
a mean rhythm section.

706
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:47,488
Denial!

707
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:57,873
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

708
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:00,709
thank you...
both of you.

709
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:04,296
That song was
by Mr Kurt Cobain,

710
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:06,048
now that kid's
got a future, huh?

711
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:09,051
How about Kwahng Yi on guitar,
ladies and gentlemen!

712
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,928
Give it up!

713
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:13,388
Kwahng Yi!

714
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:15,557
Give it up, Kwahng.

715
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:20,979
You know, I'd like
to take it down a little.

716
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:23,440
What do you say,
girls?

717
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:30,697
This is actually the first song
I've ever written.

718
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:34,618
And, it's written
for a guy to sing.

719
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:38,330
I know a lot of you guys
out there tonight,

720
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:40,123
a lot better
than some of you

721
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:42,876
would care to admit.

722
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:44,962
And I know
that a few of you

723
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:48,382
kick some
karaoke ass.

724
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:49,800
So...

725
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:56,431
if you're looking
for your big, breakout single,

726
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:59,726
you might wanna put a bid
on this one tonight,

727
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,229
Iadies and gentlemen,
because we are talking

728
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:06,400
to Phil Collins'
people, right?

729
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:12,990
But then again,
aren't we all?

730
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:19,371
You know the sun
is in your eyes

731
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:27,296
And hurricanes
and rain

732
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:31,800
And black
and cloudy skies

733
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:38,390
You're running
up and down that hill

734
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:43,353
You turn it on
and off at will

735
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:45,439
There's nothing here

736
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:49,610
To thrill
or bring you down

737
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:57,826
And if you've got
no other choice

738
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:02,706
You know you can
follow my voice

739
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,959
Through the dark turns
and noise

740
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:09,546
Of this wicked
little town

741
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:13,592
Ah-hh...

742
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:19,473
Ah-hh...

743
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:36,323
The fates
are vicious

744
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:39,076
And they're cruel

745
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:47,000
You learned too late,
you've used

746
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:50,921
Two wishes
like a fool

747
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:58,178
And then you're someone
you are not

748
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:02,808
And Junction City
ain't the spot

749
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:09,982
Remember Mrs Lot
when she turned around

750
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:17,698
And if you've got
no other choice

751
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:22,619
You know you can
follow my voice

752
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:25,706
Through the dark turns
and noise

753
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:29,459
Of this wicked
little town.

754
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:00,240
Your show...

755
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,743
that song...

756
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:06,205
My dad gave me
this guitar to apologise

757
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:08,707
for being such
a pathetic little dictator.

758
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:12,961
- He sang me songs--
- Classics.

759
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:15,589
The bands
were new to me--

760
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:17,424
Boston, Kansas,

761
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:20,427
America, Europe, Asia.

762
00:54:20,511 --> 00:54:22,930
Travel
exhausts me.

763
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:30,646
Where are you from,
Hedwig?

764
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,876
I told him my story.

765
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,379
I'm from
East Berlin.

766
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:21,780
Have you...

767
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:24,116
have you accepted
Jesus Christ

768
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,660
as your personal lord
and savior?

769
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,414
No, but l...

770
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,001
I love his work.

771
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:39,006
No. What he was
saving us from

772
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,466
was his fucking father.

773
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:45,262
What kind of god

774
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:48,557
creates Adam in his image

775
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,561
and then pulls Eve out of him
to keep him company?

776
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:55,856
And then tells them
not to eat

777
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,275
from the Tree
of Knowledge?

778
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:01,236
He was
so micromanaging.

779
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:04,823
So was Adam.

780
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:06,492
But Eve...

781
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:10,454
Eve just wanted
to know shit.

782
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:15,667
She took a bite
of the apple,

783
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:17,461
and she found out
what was good

784
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:19,004
and what was evil.

785
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:21,882
Then she gave it
to Adam,

786
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:24,009
so he would know,

787
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:26,470
because they were
in love.

788
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:30,641
And that was good,
they now knew.

789
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,607
Hedwig...

790
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,735
would you give me
the apple?

791
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,492
The words falling
from those lips.

792
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,494
And his eyes...

793
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:54,331
his irises
were clear cylinders

794
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:56,542
of surprising depth...

795
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:59,002
and emptiness.

796
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:01,630
Only a few puddles
of bluish pain

797
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:03,966
sloshed around inside.

798
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:06,885
Same blue
as my eyes.

799
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,141
At the time,

800
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,726
Tommy's performance options
were limited

801
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,395
to the occasional
guitar mass.

802
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:22,234
I initiated a six-month
curriculum of rock history...

803
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:25,404
Iyrics...

804
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:27,322
grooming...

805
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:29,241
and vocal training.

806
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:30,993
Do, do-do,
do-do...

807
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:33,537
For his graduation present,
I gave him his name:

808
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,080
Tommy Gnosis,

809
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:37,624
the Greek word
for knowledge.

810
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:41,128
We collaborated.

811
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:43,922
Songs exploded
out of us.

812
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:46,008
Teenage girls
started showing up.

813
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:54,725
In three months,
we were outgrossing

814
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:57,603
monster trucks
in Wichita.

815
00:57:57,686 --> 00:57:59,855
With that kind of money
coming in,

816
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:03,025
I was able to devote myself
entirely to our career.

817
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:04,443
We were very happy.

818
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:10,365
Honey,
what is wrong?

819
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,201
My dad.

820
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:14,119
Fucking parents!

821
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,999
You're gonna blow
my house down.

822
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:20,501
Honey, come here.

823
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:33,847
Just let it go,
sweetie.

824
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:35,974
Let it go.

825
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:39,812
It's gone.

826
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:42,773
I feel it,
it's gone.

827
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:02,709
I'm very much aware
that we haven't kissed

828
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:05,295
in all the months
we've been together.

829
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:09,341
In fact, he's maintained
a near perfect ignorance

830
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:10,717
of the front of me.

831
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:13,971
Honey, sweetie,
you're choking me.

832
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:17,182
Sweetie, let go.
Take it easy.

833
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:19,476
You wanna work
on that new song?

834
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,771
Hmm? The hit?

835
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:25,774
While I finish trimming
your eyebrows?

836
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:28,026
Are you drunk?

837
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,905
I'm not drunk.

838
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:33,866
I'm enjoying
a little...

839
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,788
a little rainwater
and Everclear.

840
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:46,461
Look what
you've done...

841
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,005
Shit!

842
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:52,843
And l...

843
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:57,014
Will always
love you...

844
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,225
What do you think?

845
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:01,810
You think love
lasts forever?

846
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:04,396
No, but
this song does.

847
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,566
Don't knock
a multi-platinum single.

848
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:09,693
When you are suddenly
Mr Commercial?

849
01:00:09,776 --> 01:00:11,320
I wish I could hit
those notes.

850
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:14,656
She's been singing this song
on a loop for three days.

851
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,081
Seriously,
Tom, yeah.

852
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:27,461
I believe love
is immortal.

853
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:33,050
Look what
you've done...

854
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:34,384
Fuck!

855
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:36,637
I can't hear
myself.

856
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:41,391
How is it
immortal?

857
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,772
I don't know,
perhaps because...

858
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,483
Iove creates
something that...

859
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:54,196
was not there
before.

860
01:00:58,659 --> 01:01:00,744
What?

861
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:03,205
Like procreation?

862
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:05,290
Yeah,
but not only.

863
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,669
What?

864
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,629
Like recreation.

865
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:12,464
What is that?
Stop, you come in here crying

866
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:15,050
and you wanna
recreate with me.

867
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:19,805
Maybe just...

868
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:22,933
creation.

869
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:26,812
Don't move.

870
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:58,343
Look what
you've done.

871
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:06,435
And l...

872
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:11,398
Will always
love you

873
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:18,614
I will always
love you

874
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:25,871
I will always
love you

875
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:33,420
I will always
love you

876
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:42,471
I will always
love you

877
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:46,517
I will always...

878
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:48,227
Breathe through
my mouth.

879
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:52,981
Love you.

880
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:34,815
Oh, God.

881
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,775
Oh, Hedwig...

882
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,944
When Eve was still
inside Adam,

883
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:41,446
- they were in paradise.
- That's right, honey.

884
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,115
When she was
separated from him,

885
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:45,826
that's when paradise
was lost.

886
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,287
So when she enters
him again,

887
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,372
paradise will be
regained.

888
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:53,750
However you want it, honey.
Just kiss me while we do it.

889
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:18,817
What is that?

890
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:29,786
It's what I have
to work with.

891
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:41,840
M-my mum's probably
wondering where I am--

892
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:44,134
You're such
a fucking sissy.

893
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:46,053
You are such
a sissy!

894
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,680
What are you
afraid of, huh?

895
01:04:48,764 --> 01:04:49,973
What are you
afraid of?

896
01:04:50,057 --> 01:04:51,391
What!?

897
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:53,185
I love you,
I love you!

898
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:55,354
Then love
the front of me, honey!

899
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,855
Love the--

900
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:20,170
We are dry,
we're spent--

901
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:22,422
we're flat broke.

902
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:27,427
- Who ordered the pizza?
- Oh, pizza. Hallelujah.

903
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:29,346
Schlatko, what are you
talking about?

904
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:31,849
We can't afford a pizza--
this is Manhattan! We can barely--

905
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:33,934
come on in-- we can barely
afford this hole.

906
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:35,769
We had to cancel
the gig tonight

907
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:37,896
because we can't
fix the amps.

908
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,774
No, I don't have any more money.
Schlatko, please!

909
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:45,696
I got it.

910
01:05:45,779 --> 01:05:47,823
Yes you did,
and it's stunning--

911
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:49,658
Fuck off,
Phyllis.

912
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:51,368
I got the part.

913
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:52,870
I'm playing
the role of "Angel"

914
01:05:52,953 --> 01:05:54,621
in Broadway Cruise's
Polynesian tour of "Rent,"

915
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:56,540
so fuck you too,
Miss Hedwig!

916
01:05:56,623 --> 01:05:58,876
I'm going to be a star.
Big star.

917
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:01,378
There's nothing
you can do about it!

918
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:07,134
Yeah, okay...
I don't care.

919
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:10,262
I don't care
if you have my passport.

920
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:12,431
Fuck you,
I'm going to Guam!

921
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:15,225
And I want
a divorce.

922
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:17,478
I want a divorce
from you.

923
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:20,856
Mental cruelty,
irreconcilable difference!

924
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:46,340
I'm exhausted.

925
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:50,969
Are you tired?

926
01:06:56,642 --> 01:06:58,644
You look tired.

927
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:10,405
I think maybe
we are just...

928
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:13,992
both very tired.

929
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,151
Hedwig...!

930
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:53,198
I don't think
you need my help anymore.

931
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:22,311
THREE WEEKS LATER

932
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:06,415
Fire shot down
from the sky in bolts

933
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:10,043
Like shining blades
of a knife

934
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:13,964
And it ripped
right through the flesh

935
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:15,924
Of the children

936
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:19,511
Of the sun and the moon
and the earth

937
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:21,472
And some lndian god

938
01:10:21,555 --> 01:10:23,765
Sewed the wound up
into a hole

939
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:25,142
Pulled it round
to our bellies

940
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:29,480
To remind us
of the price we pay

941
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:32,524
And Osiris...

942
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:35,652
Wait, did you sing
"the Cyrus"?

943
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,447
No, no--

944
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,616
You just sang "the Cyrus"
on that recording.

945
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:43,243
The Cyrus, Cyrus.
Cyrus the god.

946
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:46,747
There's no god
called "Cyrus."

947
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,041
It's "Osiris,"
it's an Egyptian god.

948
01:10:49,124 --> 01:10:51,960
- We read that book--
- We had two versions of that song.

949
01:10:52,044 --> 01:10:54,338
- We had one version--
- No, we had two versions--

950
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:55,839
--and you
fucked it up!

951
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:10,187
I know.

952
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:31,041
Maybe... maybe
we could jam sometime?

953
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,092
Maybe we could.

954
01:11:44,096 --> 01:11:48,058
...Was the same
as the one down in mine

955
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:51,061
That's the pain

956
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:55,607
Cuts a straight line
down through the heart

957
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:58,026
We called it love

958
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,028
So we wrapped our arms
around each other

959
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:01,488
Trying to shove--

960
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,913
Tommy, what's
your relationship

961
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:11,373
to Hedwig Robinson?

962
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:13,125
I never knew that woman
before that night,

963
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,960
and I never knew
she wasn't a woman.

964
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:24,344
Doll!

965
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:26,096
Thank you so much.

966
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,639
Hedwig and
the Angry Inch!

967
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:32,996
I was born

968
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:36,667
On the other side

969
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:46,635
Of a town
ripped in two

970
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:54,560
And no matter
how hard I try

971
01:13:56,687 --> 01:14:03,235
I end up
black and blue

972
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:07,614
I rose from off
of the doctor's slab

973
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:16,707
I lost a piece
of my heart

974
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:23,046
Now everyone
gets to take a stab

975
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:31,180
They cut me up
into parts

976
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:36,518
I gave a piece
to my mother

977
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:46,069
I gave a piece
to my man

978
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:53,827
I gave a piece
to the rock star

979
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:02,127
He took
the good stuff...

980
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:09,885
And ran

981
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:13,680
I've got it
all sewn up

982
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:17,142
A hardened razor cut,
scar map across my body

983
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:21,021
And you can
trace the lines

984
01:15:21,104 --> 01:15:23,690
Through misery's designs
that map across my body

985
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:25,400
A collage

986
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:28,487
I'm all sewn up

987
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:31,907
A montage

988
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:34,993
I'm all sewn up

989
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:40,415
A random pattern
with a needle and thread

990
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:43,502
The overlapping way
diseases are spread

991
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:47,297
To a tornado body
with a hand grenade head

992
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:52,219
And the legs
are two lovers entwined

993
01:15:52,302 --> 01:15:55,055
Inside I'm hollowed out
outside's a paper shroud

994
01:15:55,139 --> 01:15:58,225
And all the rest's
illusion

995
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:00,102
That there's
a will and soul

996
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:03,522
That we can wrest control
from chaos and confusion

997
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:05,232
A collage

998
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:08,735
I'm all sewn up

999
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,780
A montage

1000
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:14,783
I'm all sewn up.

1001
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:20,581
Wow!

1002
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:46,523
Just a boy...

1003
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:52,070
No cosmic lover...

1004
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:56,116
This wicked town...

1005
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:00,621
Something beautiful
and new...

1006
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:08,962
Forgive me
for I did not know

1007
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:17,679
'Cause I was
just a boy

1008
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:20,891
You were
so much more

1009
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:28,190
Than any god
could ever plan

1010
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:32,861
More than a woman
or a man

1011
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:36,323
Now I understand

1012
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:39,993
How much I took
from you

1013
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:47,417
That when everything
starts breaking down

1014
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:51,755
You take the pieces
off the ground

1015
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:55,008
Show this wicked town

1016
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:59,513
Something beautiful
and new

1017
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:06,061
You think that luck
has left you there

1018
01:18:11,024 --> 01:18:14,361
But maybe
there's nothing

1019
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:18,490
Up in the sky
but air

1020
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:24,538
And there's
no mystical design

1021
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:29,668
No cosmic lover
preassigned

1022
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:33,005
There's nothing
you can find

1023
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:36,341
That cannot
be found

1024
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:44,016
'Cause with all the changes
you've been through

1025
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:48,645
It seems the stranger's
always you

1026
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:55,611
Alone again in some new
wicked little town

1027
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:01,325
Ah-hh

1028
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:06,538
Ah-hh

1029
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:10,959
Ah-hh

1030
01:19:11,043 --> 01:19:15,380
Ah-hh

1031
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:21,178
And when you've got
no other choice

1032
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:25,933
You know you can
follow my voice

1033
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:29,144
Through the dark turns
and noise

1034
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:33,065
Of this wicked
little town

1035
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:36,026
It's a wicked

1036
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:40,531
Little town

1037
01:19:43,075 --> 01:19:45,828
Goodbye, wicked...

1038
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:52,459
Little town.

1039
01:21:22,466 --> 01:21:29,181
Rain falls hard

1040
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:34,186
Burns dry

1041
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:39,191
A dream
or a song

1042
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:44,321
That hits you
so hard

1043
01:21:46,657 --> 01:21:49,076
Filling you up

1044
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,039
Suddenly gone

1045
01:21:58,293 --> 01:22:00,420
Breathe

1046
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:03,215
Feel

1047
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:05,884
Love

1048
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:08,011
Give

1049
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:10,430
Free

1050
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:14,184
Know in your soul

1051
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:19,398
Like your blood
knows the way

1052
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:24,570
From your heart
to your brain

1053
01:22:26,697 --> 01:22:31,368
Knows that
you're whole

1054
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:37,207
And you're shining
like the brightest star

1055
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:42,421
A transmission
on the midnight radio

1056
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:50,137
And you're spinning

1057
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,181
Like a 45

1058
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:54,349
Ballerina

1059
01:22:54,433 --> 01:23:00,147
Dancing to
your rock and roll...

1060
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:08,906
Here's to Patti

1061
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,909
And Tina

1062
01:23:11,992 --> 01:23:14,077
And Yoko

1063
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:16,371
Aretha

1064
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:18,707
And Nona

1065
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:21,752
And Nico

1066
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:22,878
And me

1067
01:23:25,214 --> 01:23:28,175
And all the strange
rock and rollers

1068
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:32,262
You know you're doing
alright

1069
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:37,392
So hold on
to each other

1070
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:43,273
You gotta
hold on tonight

1071
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:49,947
And you're shining
like the brightest star

1072
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:57,621
A transmission
on the midnight radio

1073
01:23:59,706 --> 01:24:01,625
And you're spinning

1074
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:04,086
Your new 45s

1075
01:24:04,169 --> 01:24:08,882
All the misfits
and the losers

1076
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:13,804
Well, you know
you're rock and rollers

1077
01:24:13,887 --> 01:24:18,600
Spinning to

1078
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:25,149
Your rock and roll

1079
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,911
Lift up your hands

1080
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:42,916
Lift up your hands

1081
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:48,297
Lift up your hands

1082
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:54,219
Lift up your hands

1083
01:24:54,303 --> 01:24:58,724
Lift up your hands

1084
01:24:58,807 --> 01:25:03,937
Lift up your hands

1085
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:11,445
Now! Now!

1086
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:20,996
Lift up your hands

1087
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:25,417
Lift up your hands.

1088
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:49,042
When the earth
was still flat

1089
01:26:49,126 --> 01:26:52,379
And clouds made
of fire

1090
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:55,799
And mountains stretched up
to the sky

1091
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:58,719
Sometimes higher

1092
01:27:01,513 --> 01:27:03,765
Folks roamed the earth

1093
01:27:03,849 --> 01:27:05,976
Like big rolling kegs

1094
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:08,645
They had
two sets of arms

1095
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:11,106
They had
two sets of legs

1096
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:16,153
They had two faces peering
out of one giant head

1097
01:27:16,236 --> 01:27:19,406
So they could
watch all around them

1098
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:21,700
As they talked
while they read

1099
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:25,996
And they never
knew nothing of love

1100
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:30,292
It was before

1101
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:34,213
The origin of love

1102
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:39,301
The origin of love

1103
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:44,932
Now there was
three sexes then

1104
01:27:45,015 --> 01:27:49,228
One that looked like two men
glued up back-to-back

1105
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:52,397
They called
the children of the sun

1106
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:54,858
And similar
in shape and girth

1107
01:27:54,942 --> 01:27:57,653
Was the children
of the Earth

1108
01:27:57,736 --> 01:28:01,240
They looked like
two girls rolled up in one

1109
01:28:02,366 --> 01:28:04,576
And the children
of the moon

1110
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:07,246
Was like a fork
shoved on a spoon

1111
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:13,168
They was part sun, part earth
part daughter, part son

1112
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:19,049
Ah-hh...
the origin of love.

1113
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:53,625
Some girls,
they got natural ease

1114
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:57,713
They wear it
any way they please

1115
01:28:57,796 --> 01:29:00,007
With their French
flip curls

1116
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:03,010
And perfumed
magazines

1117
01:29:04,553 --> 01:29:06,513
Wear it up

1118
01:29:06,597 --> 01:29:08,307
Let it down

1119
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:12,686
This is the best way
that I've found

1120
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:16,356
To be the best
you've ever seen

1121
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,650
I put on
some makeup

1122
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:22,613
Turn on the eight-track

1123
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:27,910
I'm pulling the wig
down from the shelf

1124
01:29:31,788 --> 01:29:37,753
Suddenly I'm
Miss Farrah Fawcett from TV

1125
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:39,963
Until I wake up

1126
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:43,550
And I turn back
to myself

1127
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:48,514
Shag, bi-level, bob,
Dorothy Hamill do

1128
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:50,432
Sausage curls
chicken wings

1129
01:29:50,516 --> 01:29:52,100
It's all because
of you

1130
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:53,852
With your blow-dried
feather back

1131
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:55,395
Toni Home Wave, too

1132
01:29:55,479 --> 01:29:57,231
Flip, 'fro,
frizz, flop

1133
01:29:57,314 --> 01:29:58,732
It's all because
of you

1134
01:29:58,816 --> 01:30:00,317
It's all because
of you

1135
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,319
It's all because
of you.

1136
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:17,417
Okay, everybody.

1137
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:20,254
I put on some makeup

1138
01:30:21,964 --> 01:30:24,216
Turn on the eight-track

1139
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:29,263
I'm pulling the wig
down from the shelf

1140
01:30:33,225 --> 01:30:36,520
Suddenly I'm
this punk rock star

1141
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:38,939
Of stage and screen

1142
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:40,691
And I ain't never

1143
01:30:41,942 --> 01:30:43,735
I'm never turning back

1144
01:30:56,081 --> 01:30:58,959
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1145
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:02,296
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1146
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:05,466
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1147
01:31:05,549 --> 01:31:08,510
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1148
01:31:08,594 --> 01:31:11,680
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1149
01:31:11,763 --> 01:31:14,766
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1150
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,853
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1151
01:31:17,936 --> 01:31:21,064
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1152
01:31:21,148 --> 01:31:24,234
Do-do-do
do-do do-do

1153
01:31:24,318 --> 01:31:28,780
Do-do-do
do-do do-do.
