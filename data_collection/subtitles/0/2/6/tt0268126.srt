1
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:26,296
Do I have an original thought
in my head? My bald head?

2
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:29,304
Maybe if I were happier,
my hair wouldn't be falling out.

3
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:32,875
Life is short. I need
to make the most of it.

4
00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:36,536
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

5
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:39,115
I'm a walking cliche.

6
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:41,877
I really need to go to the doctor
and have my leg checked.

7
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:43,680
There's something wrong.
A bump.

8
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:46,153
The dentist called again.
I'm way overdue.

9
00:00:46,324 --> 00:00:48,554
If I stopped putting things off,
I'd be happier.

10
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:53,354
All I do is sit on my fat ass.
If my ass wasn't fat, I'd be happier.

11
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:56,762
I wouldn't have to wear these shirts
with the tails out all the time.

12
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:58,492
Like that's fooling anyone.

13
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:02,400
Fat ass. I should start jogging again.
Five miles a day.

14
00:01:02,573 --> 00:01:05,633
Really do it this time.
Maybe rock climbing.

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,471
I need to turn my life around.

16
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:10,239
What do I need to do?
I need to fall in love.

17
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:11,881
I need to have a girlfriend.

18
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,347
I need to read more,
improve myself.

19
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,248
What if I learned Russian
or something?

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,446
Or took up an instrument?
I could speak Chinese.

21
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:23,025
I would be the screenwriter who
speaks Chinese. And plays the oboe.

22
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:25,890
That would be cool.
I should get my hair cut short.

23
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:29,157
Stop trying to fool everyone
into thinking I have a full head of hair.

24
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,359
How pathetic is that?
Just be real. Confident.

25
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:34,732
Isn't that what women
are attracted to?

26
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:36,464
Men don't have to be attractive.

27
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:39,075
But that's not true,
especially these days.

28
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:42,337
Almost as much pressure on men
as there is on women these days.

29
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:45,539
Why should I be made to feel I have
to apologize for my existence?

30
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,377
Maybe it's my brain chemistry.

31
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:49,782
Maybe that's what's wrong with me:
bad chemistry.

32
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:53,014
All my problems and anxiety can be
reduced to a chemical imbalance...

33
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:55,159
...or some kind of
misfiring synapses.

34
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:57,089
I need to get help for that.

35
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,388
But I'll still be ugly, though.

36
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,225
Nothing's gonna change that.

37
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:01,532
Shut up!

38
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:02,396
Shut up!

39
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:08,594
Let's really try today
to solve our camera problems.

40
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:12,202
Keep between-take time
at an absolute minimum.

41
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:14,571
These masks are really hot. Okay?

42
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:17,373
I wanna be very well-heard
on that from everybody.

43
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:22,417
Don't futz unless it's absolutely
important to the shot, okay?

44
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:25,784
I don't say that for me.
I say that for the people sitting here...

45
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:27,584
- Thank you, John.
- ...in the rubber.

46
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:30,318
- I like my dress. Okay?
- Very good.

47
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:33,891
So now, folks, you better
heed that advice.

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,328
Stand by for picture.

49
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,703
Have her rotate around the table
a little bit further.

50
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,003
Hold on until we're clear.

51
00:02:46,177 --> 00:02:49,146
You. You're in the eyeline.
Can you please get off the stage?

52
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,611
Yeah, just bring in the six-footer.

53
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:59,556
What am I doing here?
Why did I bother to come here today?

54
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,687
Nobody even seems to know
my name.

55
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:06,853
I've been on this planet for 40 years,
and I don't understand a single thing.

56
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:10,000
Why am I here?
How did I get here?

57
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:09,251
My leg hurts. I wonder if it's cancer.

58
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:11,952
There's a bump. I'm starting to sweat.
Stop sweating.

59
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,188
I've got to stop sweating.

60
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:17,129
Can she see it dripping
down my forehead?

61
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:19,929
She looked at my hairline.
She thinks I'm bald. She--

62
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:22,629
We think you're great.

63
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:24,502
Thanks. That's nice to hear.

64
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:27,473
We all just loved the Malkovich script.

65
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:29,977
- Thanks. Thanks....
- Such a unique voice.

66
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:32,775
Boy, I'd love to find
a portal into your brain.

67
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,747
Trust me, it's no fun.

68
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:39,956
So tell me your thoughts
on this crazy little project of ours.

69
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:43,754
First, I think it's a great book.

70
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:47,426
- Laroche is a fun character, isn't he?
- Absolutely.

71
00:04:47,598 --> 00:04:50,829
And Orlean makes orchids
so fascinating.

72
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:54,562
Plus, her musings on Florida
and orchid poaching...

73
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,970
...Indians. It's just-- It's great,
sprawling New Yorker stuff.

74
00:04:58,142 --> 00:04:59,769
I'd want to remain true to that.

75
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:03,880
I'd wanna let the movie exist,
rather than be...

76
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:07,449
- ...artificially plot-driven.
- Great.

77
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:10,513
I guess I'm not exactly sure
what that means.

78
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,155
I'm not sure I know
what that means either.

79
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:19,353
I just don't wanna ruin it by making
it a Hollywood thing. You know?

80
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,194
Like...an orchid heist movie
or something, you know?

81
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:26,928
Or changing the orchids
into poppies...

82
00:05:27,104 --> 00:05:29,095
...and making it about drug running,
you know?

83
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:31,138
- Definitely.
- Why can't there be a movie...

84
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:33,242
...simply about flowers?

85
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,678
I guess we thought that maybe...

86
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:39,213
...Susan Orlean and Laroche
could fall in love, and--

87
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:43,149
Okay. But I'm saying, it's like,
I don't wanna cram in sex...

88
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,346
...or guns or car chases...

89
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:50,187
...you know,
or characters, you know...

90
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,886
...learning profound life lessons.

91
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:55,054
Or growing,
or coming to like each other...

92
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:58,497
...or overcoming obstacles to succeed
in the end, you know? I mean--

93
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:01,194
The book isn't like that...

94
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:05,206
...and life isn't like that.
You know, it just isn't. And....

95
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:10,574
I feel very strongly about this.

96
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,818
John Laroche is a tall guy,
skinny as a stick...

97
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:18,784
...pale-eyed,
slouch-shouldered...

98
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:23,586
...sharply handsome, despite the fact
he's missing all his front teeth.

99
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:27,356
I went to Florida two years ago
to write a piece for The New Yorker.

100
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:31,627
It was after reading a small article about
a white man and three Seminole men...

101
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,498
...arrested with rare orchids
they'd stolen out of a place...

102
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:37,971
...called the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

103
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:45,707
As natural selection works solely by
and for the good of each being...

104
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:52,182
...all corporeal and mental endowments
will tend to progress towards perfection.

105
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:56,349
It's interesting to contemplate
an entangled bank....

106
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:16,539
Polyrrhiza lindenii.

107
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:19,575
A ghost.

108
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:24,983
Cut her down, Russell.

109
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:10,091
- Morning.
- Hey.

110
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:13,100
May I ask you gentlemen what you
have in those pillowcases?

111
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:15,929
Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

112
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:19,265
- Okay, then, I'm asking.
- Well, okay, then.

113
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:20,876
Let's see.

114
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:25,044
We've got five kinds of bromeliad...

115
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:28,651
...one peperomia,
nine orchid varieties.

116
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:33,812
You know,
about 130 plants all told.

117
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,323
Which my colleagues here
removed from the swamp.

118
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:41,055
You're aware it's illegal to remove plants
or animals from state-owned land?

119
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,131
Yeah, and don't forget...

120
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,701
...these plants are all endangered, sir.
Every one of them.

121
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,897
Well, exactly. That's exactly the issue.
This is a state preserve.

122
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,206
Yes, sir. It is.

123
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:56,708
- But--
- My colleagues are all Seminole Indians.

124
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,178
Did I mention that?
You're familiar, I'm sure...

125
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,818
...with the State of Florida
v. James E. Billie?

126
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:07,086
So you know that even though Seminole
Chief Billie killed a Florida panther...

127
00:09:07,257 --> 00:09:09,384
...one of what, 40 in the entire world?

128
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,891
- Forty.
- Forty.

129
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:13,461
The state couldn't successfully
prosecute him...

130
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:16,532
...because, you know, he's an Indian,
and it's his right.

131
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,728
As repugnant as you and I, as white
conservationists, might find his actions.

132
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:24,703
- But--
- Not to mention the failed attempts...

133
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:29,278
...on three occasions to prosecute
Seminoles for poaching palm fronds.

134
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:34,713
Which I believe they use to thatch
the roofs of their traditional chickee huts.

135
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:37,720
How about that?
With the chickee huts, right?

136
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:41,949
Yeah, he's right. That's exactly what
we use them for. Chickee huts.

137
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:48,531
Yeah, but I don't--

138
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:52,032
I can't let you fellas leave yet.

139
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:56,361
- Just hold on there a minute.
- Okay.

140
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,574
Charles, is that you?

141
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,377
Did you eat lunch?

142
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:08,884
I had that shrimp cocktail in the fridge.
Was it yours?

143
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:12,352
I hope not. I couldn't remember,
so I ate it.

144
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:15,651
Maybe we should write our names
on our food items from now on.

145
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:18,351
- What's with you?
- My back.

146
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:22,932
Charles, you'll be glad. I have a plan
to get me out of your house, pronto.

147
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,901
- A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?
- Drum roll, please.

148
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,399
I'm gonna be a screenwriter.
Like you.

149
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:35,477
I know you think this is just
one of my "get rich quick" schemes...

150
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:37,273
...but I'm doing it right this time.

151
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:41,214
I'm taking a three-day seminar,
and it's only 500 bucks.

152
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:43,945
Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.

153
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:47,113
In theory, I agree with you.
But this one's different.

154
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,225
This one's highly regarded
in the industry.

155
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,657
Donald, don't say "industry."

156
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,797
I'm sorry. I forgot.

157
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:56,524
Charles, this guy knows screenwriting.

158
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
People come from all over
to study with him.

159
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,931
- I'll pay you back as soon as I--
- Let me explain something.

160
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:05,769
Anybody who says he's got "the answer"
is going to attract desperate people...

161
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:07,535
...be it in the world of religion--

162
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,077
I just need to lie down
while you explain this to me.

163
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:12,374
Sorry. I apologize.

164
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:14,980
Okay, go ahead.

165
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,586
- So--
- Sorry. Okay. Go.

166
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,086
There are no rules, Donald.

167
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,747
And anybody who says there are
is just, you know--

168
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:24,985
Not rules. Principles.

169
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,429
McKee writes that a rule says,
"You must do it this way."

170
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,230
A principle says, "This works
and has through all remembered time."

171
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:37,396
The script I'm starting,
it's about flowers.

172
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:40,640
Nobody's ever done a movie
about flowers before.

173
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:44,611
- So there are no guidelines.
- What about Flowers for Algernon?

174
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:47,478
Well, that's not about flowers.
And it's not a movie.

175
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:49,551
I'm sorry. I never saw it.

176
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,153
How--? Okay, keep going.

177
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:53,915
Look, my point is
that those teachers are dangerous...

178
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:56,082
...if your goal is to try
to do something new.

179
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,026
A writer should always have that goal.
Writing is a journey into the unknown.

180
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:03,496
It's not building, you know,
one of your model airplanes.

181
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:10,496
McKee is a former Fulbright Scholar,
Charles.

182
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:13,802
Are you a former Fulbright Scholar?

183
00:12:17,014 --> 00:12:20,177
Say something. I dragged her here,
and now I'm not saying anything.

184
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,181
Make her laugh.
Say something funny.

185
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:25,981
I hate parties, Amelia.
Why did we come here?

186
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:28,852
Because we're hip, young trendsetters
on the make, aren't we?

187
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:31,790
More like old losers
sitting on the floor, maybe.

188
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:36,763
Jesus, Charlie. Speak for yourself.
Okay....

189
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:40,028
Charlie, we're gonna fix you up.

190
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:44,573
We're gonna solve the whole Charlie
Kaufman mess for once and for all.

191
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,436
- Okay.
- Okay, let me see.

192
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,046
What do you need?
What, what, what?

193
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:53,080
Well, I'm glad you took
the orchid script.

194
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:56,648
I think it will be good for you
to get out of your head.

195
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,120
I think it'll ground you to think about the
bigger picture, about nature and stuff.

196
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:04,224
I still can't believe they gave me
that job.

197
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:08,262
I mean, after that lunch.
I was sweating insanely.

198
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,299
I was ranting. I was a mess.

199
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:13,459
You were just nervous
because she was pretty.

200
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:15,434
How do you know she was pretty?

201
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:19,474
After eight months of knowing you,
I think I get what makes you sweat.

202
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:23,379
Well, whatever.
Well, moving on, what next?

203
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:27,074
You need a new getup.
This whole flannel shirt thing...

204
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:30,812
...it's not really doing anything
for you anymore.

205
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:36,655
Thanks for coming out
with me tonight, Amelia.

206
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:54,574
To begin.

207
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:56,110
To begin.

208
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,510
How to start?

209
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,583
I'm hungry.

210
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:03,219
I should get coffee.

211
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:05,218
Coffee would help me think.

212
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:09,052
But I should write something first,
then reward myself with coffee.

213
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:14,789
Coffee and a muffin. Okay,
so I need to establish the themes.

214
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,233
Maybe banana-nut.

215
00:14:18,402 --> 00:14:20,495
That's a good muffin.

216
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,198
Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.

217
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:30,703
Victorian-era orchid hunter
William Arnold...

218
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:33,543
...drowned on a collecting expedition.

219
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,649
Osmers vanished without a trace
in Asia.

220
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:46,351
Augustus Margary survived toothache,
rheumatism, pleurisy and dysentery...

221
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:51,023
...only to be murdered when
he completed his mission...

222
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:54,068
...and traveled beyond Bhamo.

223
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,902
Laroche loved orchids, but I....

224
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:03,877
I came to believe he loved the
difficulty and fatality of getting them...

225
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:07,676
...almost as much as he loved
the orchids themselves.

226
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,652
I've been a professional horticulturist
for, like, 12 years.

227
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:16,686
I owned my own plant nursery,
which was destroyed by the hurricane.

228
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,953
I'm a professional plant lecturer.

229
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:22,428
I've given over, like, 60 lectures
on the cultivation of plants.

230
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:26,365
I'm a published author,
both in magazine and book form.

231
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,902
And I have extensive experience
with orchids...

232
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:34,442
...and the asexual micropropagation
of orchids under aseptic cultures.

233
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:39,548
That's laboratory work.
It's not at all like your nursery work.

234
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,885
I'm probably the smartest person
I know.

235
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:45,717
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

236
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,927
Mr.Laroche?
I'm Susan Orlean.

237
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:55,587
I'm a writer for The New Yorker.
It's a magazine that--

238
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:57,825
I'm familiar with The New Yorker.

239
00:15:58,001 --> 00:16:01,232
"The New Yorker?
Yes, The New Yorker." Right?

240
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:03,032
That's right.

241
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:06,835
I'm very interested in doing a piece
on your situation here, and--

242
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:08,710
Yeah? Yeah.

243
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,779
You wanna put this in?

244
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:13,040
I don't care what goes on here.

245
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:16,185
I'm right, and I'll take it all the way
to Supreme Court.

246
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:19,447
Because that judge can screw herself.

247
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,658
- That for real would go in?
- Absolutely.

248
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:40,873
We open on State Road 29.

249
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:44,343
A battered white van speeds along,
making a sharp, skidding right...

250
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:47,278
...into the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

251
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:51,114
The driver of the van is a skinny man
with no front teeth.

252
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:54,456
This is John Laroche.

253
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:57,691
I need a break.

254
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:03,323
- I loved the Sibelius violin concerto.
- Yeah, me too. It was great.

255
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,901
- The end was a little weird, but--
- Oh, no! God, it was passionate.

256
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,560
It was exultant.

257
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:13,266
The soloist was amazing.
Such beautiful tones. So precise.

258
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:15,138
God, it blows my mind.

259
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:18,213
- I wish I could play like that.
- You do.

260
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:22,343
Charlie. I don't.
I'm mediocre at best.

261
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,817
Well, I love listening to you play.

262
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:26,580
Thanks, Charlie.

263
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,224
Here we are.

264
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,961
What are you up to now, then?

265
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:43,038
I should probably get to bed.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

266
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:45,640
Well, good night, then.

267
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,517
I would stay out.

268
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:58,779
It's just that I've really been struggling
on the script right now.

269
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:02,391
I've been thinking about it too small,
just writing it like a story about Laroche.

270
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,687
That's not enough. I mean,
I wanted to write about flowers.

271
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:09,992
Anyway, I can't figure it out, and I
haven't been sleeping very well lately...

272
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,862
...so I thought I should get home...

273
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:16,131
...and try to get a good night's sleep,
you know. Start fresh in the morning.

274
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:18,331
Otherwise, I'd stay out.

275
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:22,604
I understand. I hope you figure it out,
Charlie. I really do.

276
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,805
Thanks. Thanks for coming out
with me and everything.

277
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:27,847
Sure, it was fun.

278
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:32,648
So I have to go to Santa Barbara next
weekend for this orchid show up there.

279
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:35,655
I thought maybe you could come.

280
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:37,683
No, I....

281
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:41,392
I don't think I can make it
next weekend.

282
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:43,795
I don't think I can.

283
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:46,492
I've got something. Sorry.

284
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,262
Okay.

285
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:51,430
So, well, okay, then.
So good night, then.

286
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,735
Good night, Charlie.

287
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,472
Why didn't I go in?
I'm such a chicken.

288
00:18:57,647 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm such an idiot. I should have
kissed her. I've blown it.

289
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,414
I should just go and knock
on her door right now and kiss her.

290
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:08,024
It would be romantic. Something
we could someday tell our kids.

291
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,025
I'm gonna do that right now.

292
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,174
- Thanks for picking me up.
- This van's a piece of shit.

293
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:32,543
But when I hit the jackpot,
I'll buy myself an awesome car.

294
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:35,150
Hey, what are you driving?

295
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:37,115
It's-- Well, it's a rental.

296
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:40,313
- It's a Lumina.
- Awesome.

297
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,323
I think I'll get one of those too.

298
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:49,897
Here we go.

299
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:55,338
Where do these people learn
to drive, huh?

300
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,331
The world's insane.

301
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:59,975
So I was impressed to hear...

302
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:02,737
...how accomplished you are
in the world of horticulture.

303
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:04,777
The thing you gotta know is...

304
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:07,883
...my whole life is looking for
a goddamn profitable plant, see?

305
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:09,348
And that's the ghost.

306
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,543
Why the ghost orchid?

307
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:15,219
Well, the sucker's rare. You know?

308
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:19,488
And I'm the only one in the world
who knows how to cultivate it.

309
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:22,860
See, the idea was, get the Indians
to pull it from the swamp.

310
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:27,094
I researched it. Long as I don't touch
the plant, Florida can't touch us.

311
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:32,574
And I stop future poaching by making
the flowers readily available in stores.

312
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:35,643
I'm a hero, the flowers are saved...

313
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:38,042
...Laroche and nature win.

314
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:41,006
Great.

315
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:43,311
Did you get that last part?

316
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:45,317
Yeah, I sure did.

317
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:48,548
Orchids are the sexiest flowers
on Earth.

318
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:54,186
The name orchid derives from the
Latin orchis, which means testicle.

319
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:55,763
Hey, Charles.

320
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:57,695
I pitched my screenplay to Mom.

321
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,664
Don't say "pitch."

322
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:02,202
Sorry. Anyway, she said it was...

323
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:04,533
...Silence of the Lambs
meets Psycho.

324
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,769
Maybe you guys could collaborate.
I hear Mom's really good with structure.

325
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:13,345
So how come Amelia
doesn't come around anymore?

326
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:16,576
Did you put the moves on her
or something?

327
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:44,069
I'm looking for John Laroche.

328
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:49,576
I'm writing an article on John,
and I stopped by.

329
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:51,584
- I hoped I could see him.
- John's not here.

330
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:57,284
Well, you were at the swamp
with him, weren't you?

331
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,291
I saw you at the courthouse,
that's how I know.

332
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:01,453
I'm Matthew Osceola.

333
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,531
Susan Orlean. Nice to meet you.

334
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,362
Maybe I could talk to you
for a second.

335
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:09,198
I'm just trying to get a feel
for the whole operation....

336
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:12,205
You have very beautiful hair.

337
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,679
Thank you very much.

338
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,577
Thank you. I just....

339
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,846
I just washed it this morning.

340
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:28,624
I just used a new conditioner.

341
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:35,390
I can see your sadness.

342
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:37,356
It's lovely.

343
00:22:39,636 --> 00:22:43,697
Well, I'm just tired, that's all.
That's my problem.

344
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:46,205
So maybe we could chat a little bit...

345
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:50,443
- ...and I could get some background--
- I'm not going to talk to you much.

346
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:52,410
It's not personal.

347
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,542
It's the Indian way.

348
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,460
Angraecum sesquipedale.

349
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,667
Beauty! God!

350
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:16,032
Darwin wrote about this one.

351
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:20,702
Charles Darwin? Evolution guy?
Hello?

352
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:22,868
You see that nectary
all the way down there?

353
00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:25,344
Darwin hypothesized a moth...

354
00:23:25,815 --> 00:23:29,046
...with a nose 12 inches long
to pollinate it.

355
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,412
Everyone thought he was a loon.

356
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:36,025
Then, sure enough, they found
this moth with a 12-inch proboscis.

357
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,218
- "Proboscis" means nose, by the way.
- I know what "proboscis" means.

358
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:43,491
Hey, let's not get off the subject.
This isn't a pissing contest.

359
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,226
The point is,
what's so wonderful...

360
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:49,462
...is that every one of these flowers
has a specific relationship...

361
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:51,436
...with the insect that pollinates it.

362
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:54,372
There's a certain orchid
looks exactly like a certain insect.

363
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:57,240
So the insect is drawn to this flower...

364
00:23:57,413 --> 00:24:00,576
...its double, its soul mate...

365
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,186
...and wants nothing more
than to make love to it.

366
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:06,917
After the insect flies off...

367
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,754
...it spots another soul-mate flower
and makes love to it, thus pollinating it.

368
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:15,386
And neither the flower nor the insect
will ever understand...

369
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:18,500
...the significance
of their lovemaking.

370
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:22,396
How could they know that because
of their little dance, the world lives?

371
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:24,403
But it does.

372
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:26,735
By simply doing
what they're designed to do...

373
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,674
...something large
and magnificent happens.

374
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:32,110
In this sense, they show us
how to live.

375
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:35,945
How the only barometer
you have is your heart.

376
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,614
How when you spot your flower,
you can't let anything get in your way.

377
00:24:49,065 --> 00:24:51,932
He's really quite a character.
No front teeth.

378
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:55,264
- Doesn't seem to bother him at all.
- Why doesn't he get them fixed?

379
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:58,896
It seems almost sociopathic
to make everybody look at that.

380
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:01,839
Yeah, but he gives
a great blowjob, honey.

381
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,174
He is a fascinating character, though.

382
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:08,647
Sounds like a gold mine, Sue.

383
00:25:08,818 --> 00:25:12,276
It could be. I don't know, you know?
He's....

384
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:16,585
He lives with his dad, he's obsessed
with his dead mother, and....

385
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,059
He wears his sunglasses on
a little dingle-dangle around his neck.

386
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,891
Loving it.

387
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:26,997
- Tell them about the van.
- Okay, the van. The van.

388
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,333
- I can't tell about the van. I gotta pee.
- No, tell us about the van.

389
00:25:30,974 --> 00:25:33,636
- It's amazing. It's....
- What's in it?

390
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,041
- You did it in the van.
- Shut up.

391
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:39,807
David, you tell--
Don't you tell them. Don't tell them.

392
00:25:39,983 --> 00:25:41,507
Okay, the van.

393
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:43,715
David!

394
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:47,782
This van was filled with junk--

395
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:48,981
Shut up!

396
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:53,424
Potting soil. Shovels.
Food wrappers. Fertilizer.

397
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:56,929
Susie said she hoped
it was fertilizer, anyway.

398
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,729
She said she couldn't be sure. Laroche
had a certain aromatic look about him.

399
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:01,892
And she said--

400
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:05,472
She said perhaps his obsessiveness
didn't leave room in his schedule...

401
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:07,837
...for personal hygiene.

402
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:12,004
Maybe the orchids got
all the available water.

403
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:18,310
I wanted to want something as much
as people wanted these plants.

404
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:20,587
But...

405
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:24,420
...it isn't part of my constitution.

406
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:29,932
I suppose I do have
one unembarrassed passion.

407
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:36,964
I wanna know what it feels like
to care about something passionately.

408
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:51,916
"Should one be lucky enough
to see a ghost orchid...

409
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:55,421
...all else will seem eclipsed."

410
00:26:58,061 --> 00:27:01,087
If the ghost orchid
was really a phantom...

411
00:27:01,264 --> 00:27:05,564
...it was still such a bewitching one that
it could seduce people to pursue it...

412
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:09,068
...year after year
and mile after miserable mile.

413
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:12,696
If it was a real flower,
I wanted to see one.

414
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,470
The reason was not that I love orchids.
I don't even especially like orchids.

415
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:20,241
What I wanted
was to see this thing...

416
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:26,719
...that people were drawn to
in such a singular and powerful way.

417
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,987
So how many turtles
did you end up collecting?

418
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:35,858
I lost interest right after that.

419
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:41,660
I dropped turtles when I fell
in love with Ice Age fossils.

420
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:44,363
Collected the shit out of them.

421
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,499
Fossils were the only thing that made
sense to me in this fucked-up world.

422
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:52,512
I ditched fossils
for resilvering old mirrors.

423
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:54,650
My mom and I
had the largest collection...

424
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:57,911
...of 19th-century Dutch mirrors
on the planet.

425
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:00,954
Perhaps you read about us.
Mirror World, October '88?

426
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,718
I got a copy here somewhere.

427
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:08,528
I guess I'd just like to know
how you can detach from something...

428
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:11,132
...that you've invested
so much of your soul in.

429
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,794
I mean, didn't you ever miss turtles?

430
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:20,204
The only thing that made
your 10-year-old life worth living?

431
00:28:20,777 --> 00:28:24,110
Look, I'll tell you a story, all right?

432
00:28:24,347 --> 00:28:29,979
I once fell deeply, you know,
profoundly in love with tropical fish.

433
00:28:30,153 --> 00:28:32,280
I had 60 goddamn fish-tanks
in my house.

434
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:35,151
I'd skin-dive to find just the right ones.

435
00:28:35,324 --> 00:28:40,762
Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus
ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus.

436
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,659
You name it.

437
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:46,057
Then one day I say, "Fuck fish."

438
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:50,569
I renounce fish. I vow never
to set foot in that ocean again.

439
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,470
That's how much "fuck fish."

440
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:59,040
That was 17 years ago, and I have
never since stuck a toe in that ocean.

441
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:01,410
And I love the ocean.

442
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:04,513
But why?

443
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:08,550
Done with fish.

444
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:13,928
If you'd really loved something,
wouldn't a little bit of it linger?

445
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:17,156
Evidently Laroche's finishes
were downright and absolute.

446
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,823
He just moved on.

447
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:22,903
I sometimes wished
I could do the same.

448
00:29:28,244 --> 00:29:31,213
Good afternoon.
So, what looks good today?

449
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,211
The key lime pie, please.

450
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:35,145
A small slice.

451
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:37,946
And a coffee, please.
Skim milk, please.

452
00:29:39,522 --> 00:29:42,423
Orchids. I love orchids.

453
00:29:42,592 --> 00:29:44,219
Cool. That's....

454
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:51,324
Well, I'll be right back with your pie.

455
00:30:01,911 --> 00:30:05,108
I'm so excited. I've always wanted
to come to an orchid show.

456
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,812
I think these flowers are so sexy.

457
00:30:09,785 --> 00:30:11,582
Let's see what's around back.

458
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,870
What?

459
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:38,809
- You wanna hear my pitch?
- Go away, goddamn it.

460
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,449
You know, I'm just trying
to do something.

461
00:30:48,457 --> 00:30:50,948
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy. Cool.

462
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:53,220
Okay, there's this serial killer, right?

463
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:56,092
Well, no, wait.
And he's being hunted by a cop.

464
00:30:56,265 --> 00:31:00,258
And he's taunting the cop, right?
Sending clues who his next victim is.

465
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:02,961
He's already holding her hostage
in his creepy basement.

466
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:05,699
So the cop gets obsessed
with figuring out her identity...

467
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,275
...and in the process
falls in love with her.

468
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:11,436
Even though he's never even met her.
She becomes like....

469
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:14,777
Like the unattainable.
Like the Holy Grail.

470
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:18,512
- It's a little obvious, don't you think?
- Okay, but here's the twist.

471
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:20,952
We find out that the killer...

472
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:24,092
...really suffers from
multiple personality disorder. Right?

473
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,821
See, he's actually really the cop
and the girl.

474
00:31:27,997 --> 00:31:31,160
All of them are him.
Isn't that fucked up?

475
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:37,368
The only idea more overused than
serial killers is multiple personality.

476
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,940
On top of that, you explore
the notion...

477
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:43,169
...that cop and criminal are
really two aspects of the same person.

478
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:46,338
See every cop movie ever made
for other examples of this.

479
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:49,109
Mom called it psychologically taut.

480
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:53,153
The other thing is, there's no way
to write this. Did you consider that?

481
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:57,782
I mean, how could you have somebody
held prisoner in a basement...

482
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,021
...and working in a police station
at the same time?

483
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:06,028
- Trick photography.
- Okay, that's not what I'm asking.

484
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:08,966
Listen closely.
What I'm asking is:

485
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:13,973
In the reality of this movie, where
there's only one character, right?

486
00:32:14,143 --> 00:32:15,701
Okay?

487
00:32:15,878 --> 00:32:17,846
How could you...?

488
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:21,609
What exactly would...?

489
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,448
I agree with Mom. Very taut.

490
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:28,522
Sybil meets, I don't know....
Dressed to Kill.

491
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:30,955
Cool. I really liked Dressed to Kill.

492
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:35,427
- Until the third act denouement.
- That's not how it's pronounced.

493
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,126
Sorry. I--
Okay, sorry.

494
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:48,810
- Some key lime pie for you today?
- Okay, yeah. That sounds great.

495
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:51,674
I'll cut you an extra-large slice.
Preferred customer.

496
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:55,442
- Thank you. That's really sweet of you.
- Well, I'm just a sweetie, ain't I?

497
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:59,146
- Still reading about orchids, I hope?
- Yes, I am.

498
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:02,188
This friend of mine
has this little, tiny pink one...

499
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:05,486
...that grows on a tree branch
just like that.

500
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:07,788
- I can't remember--
- That's called an epiphyte.

501
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:10,056
Right. Right!

502
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:11,859
Boy, you know your stuff.

503
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:15,197
No, not really. I'm just learning.

504
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:18,272
Epiphytes grow on trees,
but they're not parasites.

505
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:20,966
They get all their nourishment
from the air and the rain.

506
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:25,205
Well, I'm impressed. That's great.

507
00:33:25,815 --> 00:33:28,545
There are more than 30,000 kinds
of orchids in the world.

508
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:32,251
- Wow, that's a lot, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:33,615
Yeah.

510
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:38,886
So I'll be right back with an extra-large
slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert.

511
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,525
But-- So anyway,
I was also wondering....

512
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:48,626
I'm going up to Santa Barbara this
Saturday for an orchid show, and I....

513
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:52,672
- I'm sorry.
- Well....

514
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:56,676
- I apologize. I'm sorry.
- So I'll just be right back with your pie.

515
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:11,251
There are more than 30,000
known orchid species.

516
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:13,657
One looks like a turtle.

517
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:16,725
One looks like a monkey.

518
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,665
One looks like an onion.

519
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:21,735
One looks like a schoolteacher.

520
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:23,766
One looks like a gymnast.

521
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,904
One looks like that girl in high school
with creamy skin.

522
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,375
One looks like a New York
intellectual...

523
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:32,571
...with whom you do the Sunday
Times crossword puzzle in bed.

524
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:35,444
One looks like a Midwestern
beauty queen.

525
00:34:35,718 --> 00:34:37,913
One looks like Amelia.

526
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:39,748
One has eyes that dance.

527
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:43,653
One has eyes that contain
the sadness of the world.

528
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:51,925
So I got married,
and me and my beautiful new wife...

529
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:54,968
...my now ex-wife, the bitch...

530
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:58,064
...opened up a nursery.

531
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,266
People started coming out
of the woodwork to ask me stuff...

532
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:04,970
...and admire my plants
and admire me.

533
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:11,610
I think some people were really spending
time with me because they were lonely.

534
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:20,521
And you know why I like plants?

535
00:35:23,232 --> 00:35:25,723
Because they're so mutable.

536
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:30,772
Adaptation's a profound process.

537
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:32,731
It means you...

538
00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:36,344
...figure out how to thrive in the world.

539
00:35:40,749 --> 00:35:43,809
Yeah, but it's easier for plants.
I mean...

540
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:45,749
...they have no memory.

541
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:50,991
You know, they just move on to
whatever's next. But a person, now...

542
00:35:52,728 --> 00:35:55,788
...adapting's almost shameful.
I mean, it's like...

543
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:58,399
...running away.

544
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:35,233
Keener!

545
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:49,411
Hey, man.

546
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:51,853
Please don't hit
on crew members, Donald.

547
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:55,923
What, the makeup girl?
She was hitting on me, bro.

548
00:36:56,992 --> 00:36:59,358
Don't embarrass me.
I have to work with these people.

549
00:36:59,528 --> 00:37:02,793
I won't. Anyway, listen...

550
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:06,833
...I meant to ask you,
I need a cool way to kill people.

551
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:11,601
Don't worry. For my script.

552
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:13,935
I don't write that kind of stuff.

553
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,840
Come on, man, please?
You're the genius.

554
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:21,577
Here you go: The killer's
a literature professor.

555
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,618
He cuts off little chunks from his
victim's bodies until they die.

556
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:28,985
He calls himself
"The Deconstructionist."

557
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:34,595
- That's kind of good. I like that.
- See, I was kidding, Donald.

558
00:37:35,764 --> 00:37:38,358
Okay. Sorry.

559
00:37:38,534 --> 00:37:40,729
You got me.

560
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:44,965
Do you mind if I use it, though?

561
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:56,248
- It's really good.
- I tried to split the Cassie scene in half...

562
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:59,683
- ...from the beginning to the end.
- I saw that. Why did you do that?

563
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:03,723
Because I wanted there to be more
tension. And then you pick it up later....

564
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:06,383
- But are you changing...?
- Keeps more tension.

565
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:10,157
That way the audience
gets stuck early on.

566
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,399
- You like it?
- I really like it.

567
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:24,402
You look hot tonight, baby.

568
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,607
Thanks, Donald.
That's swell of you to say.

569
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:32,650
- Don't you think she's hot, bro?
- I'm heading home, Donald.

570
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:34,914
Really? Come on.

571
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,786
Hey, it's Amelia.

572
00:38:38,494 --> 00:38:39,756
Hey, Amelia!

573
00:38:40,162 --> 00:38:43,529
Hey, Donald.
Hey, Charlie.

574
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:48,728
- Hey. Hi there.
- God, Amelia, we don't see you anymore.

575
00:38:48,904 --> 00:38:52,738
- It's good to see you.
- This is my girlfriend, Caroline.

576
00:38:52,908 --> 00:38:55,433
- She's a makeup artist for the movies.
- Hi.

577
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,512
Hi.

578
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,307
This is David, my friend.

579
00:39:01,517 --> 00:39:03,348
- Hi.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

580
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,181
- Amelia's talked a lot about you.
- Hi, I'm Donald.

581
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:08,846
- Hey.
- Caroline.

582
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:10,616
- Cool camera.
- So how are you?

583
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:14,521
- You know me, a mess.
- Charlie...

584
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:17,130
...it's really good to see you.
Is the work good?

585
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:19,426
It's a disaster.
I don't know what I'm doing.

586
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:22,229
But, anyway, it's my problem.
I don't want to bore you.

587
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:26,135
You have your own stuff, right? I mean,
we both have our own separate stuff.

588
00:39:26,308 --> 00:39:29,141
Anyway, I should go. I was just
heading home to do some work.

589
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:32,542
- You coming?
- No, I'm gonna stay at Caroline's tonight.

590
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:35,512
A little push, push in the bush.

591
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:39,051
Donald, you're such a tard!

592
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:41,018
See you, Charlie.

593
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:48,391
To write about a flower,
to dramatize a flower...

594
00:39:48,564 --> 00:39:50,498
...I have to show the flower's arc.

595
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:53,829
And the flower's arc stretches back
to the beginning of life.

596
00:39:54,002 --> 00:39:57,130
How did this flower get here?
What was its journey?

597
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,809
Therefore, I should infer
from analogy...

598
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:06,970
...that probably all the organic beings
which have ever lived on this Earth...

599
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:12,451
...have descended
from some one primordial form...

600
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:15,488
...into which life was first breathed.

601
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:18,490
It is a journey of evolution.
Adaptation.

602
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,790
The journey we all take. A journey
that unites each and every one of us.

603
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:26,401
Darwin writes that we all come
from the very first single-cell organism.

604
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:28,300
Yet here I am.

605
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,095
And there's Laroche.
There's Orlean.

606
00:40:31,273 --> 00:40:34,902
And there's the ghost orchid.
All trapped in our own bodies...

607
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:38,171
...in moments in history.
That's it.

608
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:42,374
That's what I need to do.
Tie all of history together.

609
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:47,015
Start right before
life begins on the planet.

610
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:48,451
All is...

611
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:51,457
...lifeless.
And then, like, life begins...

612
00:40:51,627 --> 00:40:53,754
...with organisms.
Those little single-cell ones.

613
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:56,921
And it's before sex, because,
like, everything was asexual.

614
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:59,465
From there we go to bigger things.
Jellyfish.

615
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:02,331
Then that fish that got legs
and crawled out on the land.

616
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,769
And then we see,
you know, like, dinosaurs.

617
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:10,674
And then they're around for a long time.
Then an asteroid comes and:

618
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:14,043
--the insects, the mammals,
the primates, monkeys.

619
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:17,674
The simple monkeys. Old-fashioned
monkeys giving way to the new ones.

620
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:20,321
Whatever. And then apes.
Whatever. And man.

621
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:24,983
Then we see the whole history of
human civilization: hunting, war, love...

622
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,287
...heartache, disease,
loneliness, technology.

623
00:41:27,462 --> 00:41:31,398
And we end with Susan Orlean
in her office at The New Yorker...

624
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:34,001
...writing about flowers, and bang!
The movie begins.

625
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:37,764
This is the breakthrough I've been
hoping for. It's never been done.

626
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,000
McKee is a genius!

627
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:46,209
And hilarious. He just comes up with all
these great jokes, and everybody laughs.

628
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:49,549
But he's serious too, Charles.
You'd love him.

629
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:52,516
He's all for originality, just like you.

630
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:56,590
But he says we have to realize
that we all write in a genre...

631
00:41:56,758 --> 00:41:59,886
...and we must find our originality
within that genre.

632
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:05,560
There hasn't been a new genre since
Fellini invented the mockumentary.

633
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,362
My genre's thriller. What's yours?

634
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:12,530
You and I share the same DNA.

635
00:42:13,308 --> 00:42:16,175
Is there anything more lonely than that?

636
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:17,744
What'd you say, bro?

637
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,111
- Yeah?
- Hey.

638
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:29,018
Hey, Susie-Q.

639
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:30,213
What you up to?

640
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:34,594
I don't wanna bother you. Just thought
I'd call and get some more info.

641
00:42:35,697 --> 00:42:39,997
I think you say some
pretty smart things, John.

642
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:42,102
Yeah, smartest guy I know, huh?

643
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:47,200
So...

644
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:50,173
...whatever happened
to your nursery?

645
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:56,047
It was going pretty well.

646
00:42:56,218 --> 00:43:01,053
But, you know, sometimes bad
things happen, darkness descends.

647
00:43:10,332 --> 00:43:12,300
Nursery business good, Johnny?

648
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,731
Everything's good, Uncle Jim.

649
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:17,337
This last year's been a dream.

650
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:20,270
I'm telling you.
Finally pulling out of debt.

651
00:43:20,442 --> 00:43:23,434
Amen, honey.
I'm so proud of you two, and--

652
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:42,487
No, ma'am. I'm sorry,
I can't answer that.

653
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:44,256
- Stay right there.
- Hey.

654
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:48,602
- Hold it. Which ones are dead?
- Sir, please, don't move.

655
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,831
- Which ones are dead?
- Let's move it!

656
00:43:56,511 --> 00:44:01,278
I killed my mom, you know,
and my uncle.

657
00:44:02,284 --> 00:44:05,344
That's how I lost my front teeth.

658
00:44:07,456 --> 00:44:12,291
And my wife was in a coma
for, like, three weeks.

659
00:44:13,128 --> 00:44:16,859
And she divorced me soon after
she regained consciousness.

660
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:36,008
Well, I think if I almost died,
I would leave my marriage too.

661
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:39,887
Why?

662
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:42,720
Because I could.

663
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:46,827
Because it's like a free pass.
Nobody can judge you...

664
00:44:46,995 --> 00:44:50,362
...if you almost died.

665
00:44:50,532 --> 00:44:53,296
Well, I judged her.

666
00:44:54,603 --> 00:44:56,696
Maybe I was being judged too.

667
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,236
It was like a month after that, Hurricane
Andrew came along and just...

668
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,811
...swooped down
like an angel of God...

669
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:11,649
...and just wiped out everything
I had left.

670
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:15,180
Everything.

671
00:45:15,357 --> 00:45:18,918
I knew it'd break my heart
to start another nursery...

672
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:21,961
...so, you know,
when the Seminoles called...

673
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:27,625
...they wanted a white guy or an expert
to get their nursery going, I took the job.

674
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:32,706
I wasn't gonna give them a
conventional little potted-plant place.

675
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:35,602
I was gonna give them something...

676
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:38,507
...amazing, you know?

677
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,877
Yeah, I know, John.

678
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:44,351
I know.

679
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:47,249
"I was going to give them
something amazing."

680
00:45:49,691 --> 00:45:52,751
It's beautifully written.
You have such a unique voice.

681
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:55,590
Thank you very much.

682
00:45:55,764 --> 00:45:58,961
- We're big fans.
- Thank you.

683
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,728
Laroche is such a fun character.

684
00:46:02,737 --> 00:46:05,137
- Yeah.
- It's funny and fresh.

685
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:07,873
And sad in a way.

686
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:10,134
So we were wondering what's next.

687
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:13,338
Well, Random House has asked me...

688
00:46:13,515 --> 00:46:16,109
...to expand it into a book,
so I'm gonna be doing that.

689
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:19,276
- And--
- Susan, we would like to option this.

690
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,855
- You wanna make it into a movie?
- Into a movie.

691
00:46:25,026 --> 00:46:26,755
Oh, God!

692
00:46:27,863 --> 00:46:30,764
- That's really....
- How does that sound?

693
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:32,797
- That's very exciting.
- Good.

694
00:46:32,968 --> 00:46:36,995
It's just comical. I hadn't thought of it.
I've never written a screenplay before.

695
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:41,108
Don't worry about that. We have
screenwriters to write the screenplay.

696
00:46:45,313 --> 00:46:47,907
Hey, superstar.
It's Marty, super agent.

697
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:51,052
I just wanna remind you
it's been 13 weeks...

698
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:53,016
...and Valerie's anxious
to see a draft.

699
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:56,248
So if you could wrap things up and
get it to her by Monday, that'd be great.

700
00:46:56,424 --> 00:46:59,916
Call me when you get this.
Adios, amigo.

701
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:07,958
What? What'd you laugh at?

702
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:11,171
- You're a genius.
- Which line?

703
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:12,966
You're a genius.
You're a genius.

704
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,768
"We see orchid hunter
Augustus Margary.

705
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:46,431
He wears a filthy, spittle-soaked
rag around his head to quell the pain.

706
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:50,305
The back of his trousers are stained
greasy black from an anal leakage...

707
00:47:50,478 --> 00:47:52,036
...due to dysentery.

708
00:47:52,213 --> 00:47:57,845
He moans with each tentative step
through the overgrown jungle."

709
00:47:58,119 --> 00:47:59,586
I'm fucked.

710
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:03,815
We open with Laroche. He's funny.
He says, "I love to mutate plants."

711
00:48:03,992 --> 00:48:06,893
He says, "Mutation is fun."
Okay, we show flowers and.... Okay.

712
00:48:07,062 --> 00:48:08,927
We have to have the court case.
We show Laroche.

713
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,827
He says, "I was mutated as a baby.
That's why I'm so smart."

714
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,730
That's funny. Okay, we open
at the beginning of time. No!

715
00:48:14,903 --> 00:48:17,428
- Laroche is driving into the swamp.
- Crazy white man!

716
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:27,576
I don't know how to adapt this.
I should have stuck with my own stuff.

717
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:29,842
I don't know why I thought
I could write this.

718
00:48:30,018 --> 00:48:31,212
See her?

719
00:48:32,087 --> 00:48:34,555
I fucked her up the ass.

720
00:48:34,723 --> 00:48:36,816
No. I'm kidding.

721
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:41,528
Maybe I can help.

722
00:48:47,402 --> 00:48:50,200
It's about flowers.

723
00:48:50,739 --> 00:48:52,866
Okay.

724
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:57,571
But it's not only about flowers, right?
You have the crazy plant-nut guy, right?

725
00:48:57,746 --> 00:49:00,112
He's funny. Right?

726
00:49:03,885 --> 00:49:07,321
"There's not nearly enough of him
to fill a book."

727
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:12,290
So Orlean "digresses in long
passages." Blah, blah, blah.

728
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,054
"No narrative unites these passages."
New York Times Book Review.

729
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,893
I can't structure this. It's that
sprawling New Yorker shit.

730
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:21,126
Man, I'd fuck her up the ass.

731
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:26,606
- Sorry.
- The book has no story. There's no story.

732
00:49:26,775 --> 00:49:28,743
All right. Make one up.

733
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,676
I mean, nobody in this town
can make up a crazy story like you.

734
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:36,908
- You're the king of that.
- No, I didn't want to do that this time.

735
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:41,488
It's someone else's material.
I have a responsibility to Susan--

736
00:49:41,656 --> 00:49:45,854
Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer.
I wanted to do something simple.

737
00:49:46,027 --> 00:49:49,155
Show people how amazing
flowers are.

738
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:51,627
Are they amazing?

739
00:49:53,968 --> 00:49:57,460
I don't know. I think they are.

740
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:03,978
- I need you to get me out of this.
- All right.

741
00:50:05,513 --> 00:50:08,141
Charlie, you've been stringing
them along for months now.

742
00:50:08,316 --> 00:50:12,946
Not to give them anything at this
point would be a terrible career move.

743
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:23,523
Hey, my script's going amazing.

744
00:50:23,698 --> 00:50:25,928
Right now, I'm working out
an image system.

745
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:29,161
Because of my multiple personality
theme, I've chosen a motif...

746
00:50:29,337 --> 00:50:33,398
...of broken mirrors to show my
protagonist's fragmented self.

747
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:37,841
Bob says an image system increases
the complexity of an aesthetic emotion.

748
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:40,173
- Bob says--
- You sound like you're in a cult.

749
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:43,476
No, it's just good writing technique.

750
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:46,882
I made you a copy
of McKee's 10 Commandments.

751
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:49,546
I posted one over
both our work areas.

752
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:01,358
You shouldn't have done that.

753
00:51:03,638 --> 00:51:07,699
Because it's extremely helpful.
Hey, Charles, I'm putting a song on.

754
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:09,173
"Happy Together."

755
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:12,313
Like when characters sing songs
in their pajamas and dance around.

756
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,209
I thought it'd break the tension.

757
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:17,715
At first I was nervous
about putting a song in a thriller...

758
00:51:17,886 --> 00:51:22,482
...but Bob says that Casablanca, one of
the greatest screenplays ever written...

759
00:51:22,657 --> 00:51:25,785
...did exactly that.
Mixed genres.

760
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,121
I haven't slept in a week, Donald.

761
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:31,197
- I need to go to bed.
- Okay.

762
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:33,562
Good night.

763
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:42,301
- Yeah?
- Hi.

764
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:44,502
John, it's Susan again.

765
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:47,705
Hey, Susie-Q.

766
00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:50,478
How's it going?

767
00:51:50,852 --> 00:51:53,878
Great. I'm training myself
on the Internet.

768
00:51:54,455 --> 00:51:56,787
It's fascinating.
I'm doing pornography.

769
00:51:56,958 --> 00:52:00,985
It's amazing how much these suckers
will pay for photographs of chicks.

770
00:52:01,162 --> 00:52:04,962
It doesn't matter if they're fat
or ugly or what.

771
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:06,794
Well, that sounds good.

772
00:52:06,968 --> 00:52:09,630
It's great, is what it is.

773
00:52:09,804 --> 00:52:14,264
Listen, John, I hate feeling like
I'm being a pain to you, but I....

774
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:16,273
I still haven't seen a ghost.

775
00:52:16,544 --> 00:52:21,174
- Yeah?
- And I was hoping maybe you'd....

776
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:22,611
Yeah.

777
00:52:22,784 --> 00:52:24,547
Yeah, I'll take you in.

778
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:27,449
- Tomorrow.
- Really?

779
00:52:28,456 --> 00:52:31,857
Thank you so much.

780
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:33,493
Oh, John.

781
00:52:34,562 --> 00:52:36,189
Damn it.

782
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:51,538
There are too many ideas
and things and people.

783
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:53,613
Too many directions to go.

784
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:58,445
I was starting to believe the reason
it matters to care about something...

785
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:00,913
...is that it whittles the world down...

786
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:04,718
...to a more manageable size.

787
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:08,692
Such sweet, sad insights.

788
00:53:09,864 --> 00:53:12,264
So true.

789
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:28,214
I like looking at you.

790
00:53:29,651 --> 00:53:32,484
I like looking at you too, Charlie.

791
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:12,119
I don't know how to do this.

792
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,629
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

793
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:18,994
You've written a beautiful book.

794
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:21,761
I can't sleep.

795
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:26,398
I'm losing my hair.
I'm fat and repulsive.

796
00:54:26,574 --> 00:54:30,135
Shh. You're not. You're not.

797
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:35,749
Just whittle it down, you know?

798
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:38,385
Focus on one thing in the story.

799
00:54:39,053 --> 00:54:41,578
Find that one thing...

800
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:45,123
...that you care passionately about...

801
00:54:45,293 --> 00:54:47,386
...and then write about that.

802
00:54:47,562 --> 00:54:50,827
We see Susan Orlean:
delicate, haunted by loneliness...

803
00:54:50,998 --> 00:54:52,465
...fragile, beautiful.

804
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:56,535
She lies awake next to her sleeping,
insensitive husband.

805
00:54:56,704 --> 00:54:57,898
Her voice-over begins:

806
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:02,239
"I suppose I do
have one unembarrassed passion.

807
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:06,906
I want to know how it feels to care
about something passionately."

808
00:55:10,518 --> 00:55:12,850
- Hey.
- Morning.

809
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,548
Hey, you two. Up early for a change?

810
00:55:17,725 --> 00:55:22,253
- You seem chipper.
- I'm good. I have some new ideas.

811
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:27,333
God, you guys are so smart.
It's like a brain factory in here.

812
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:32,166
- I got some ideas too this morning.
- He got really, really good ones.

813
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,740
You know, in a Donald sort of way.

814
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:37,537
I'm putting--
Hey! What?

815
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:42,683
I'm putting in a chase sequence.
So the killer...

816
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:46,251
...flees on horseback with the girl.
The cop's after them on a motorcycle.

817
00:55:46,421 --> 00:55:49,083
And it's like a battle between
motors and horses.

818
00:55:49,257 --> 00:55:52,021
Like technology versus horse.

819
00:55:52,193 --> 00:55:54,525
And they're still all one person, right?

820
00:55:55,129 --> 00:55:57,154
Well, that's the big payoff.

821
00:55:57,331 --> 00:56:00,129
- It sounds exciting.
- Thanks, man.

822
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:03,327
- Thanks.
- See, I told you he was gonna like it.

823
00:56:03,938 --> 00:56:08,739
- You're my muse. You are.
- I love being your muse.

824
00:56:09,177 --> 00:56:11,737
I'm so happy about that.

825
00:56:13,147 --> 00:56:15,638
I'm picking up an order for Kaufman.

826
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:35,768
- Valerie.
- Hi, Charlie.

827
00:56:35,937 --> 00:56:37,871
It's quite a coincidence
bumping into you.

828
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:40,667
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
I was away last week.

829
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:42,810
- That's okay.
- I meant to because...

830
00:56:42,977 --> 00:56:45,445
...things are going really well now,
and I wanted you to know.

831
00:56:45,613 --> 00:56:47,740
Well, that's great.
I'm anxious to see something.

832
00:56:47,915 --> 00:56:50,475
You should sit down because
I'm here with Susan right now.

833
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:53,313
And she's dying to meet you,
so it's funny bumping into you.

834
00:56:53,488 --> 00:56:54,819
- Have a seat.
- Susan Orlean is here?

835
00:56:54,989 --> 00:56:59,892
Yeah, she's here in town for a reading
or something. She's just on the phone.

836
00:57:00,862 --> 00:57:03,626
Sit down. Have a seat.
She's dying to meet you.

837
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:09,031
Well, I should probably go, because....

838
00:57:09,203 --> 00:57:11,034
Well, I'd love to meet her too...

839
00:57:11,205 --> 00:57:14,231
...but I don't want to be beholden.
And, well--

840
00:57:14,408 --> 00:57:17,241
Because once you meet somebody
that you've been writing about...

841
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:19,845
...it becomes very hard to separate.
So....

842
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:22,676
Well, okay, I'll speak to you soon.
And I'm almost done.

843
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:23,839
I'm almost done.

844
00:57:24,018 --> 00:57:26,987
And tell Susan that I would
love to meet with her at a future date.

845
00:57:27,154 --> 00:57:28,746
- As she sees fit.
- Okay.

846
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:34,257
Who am I kidding?
This is not Susan Orlean's story.

847
00:57:34,428 --> 00:57:36,988
I have no connection with her.
I can't even meet her.

848
00:57:37,164 --> 00:57:40,190
I have no understanding of anything
but my own panic and self-loathing...

849
00:57:40,368 --> 00:57:41,892
...and pathetic, little existence.

850
00:57:42,069 --> 00:57:46,062
The only thing I'm actually qualified to
write about is myself and my own self--

851
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,798
We open on Charlie Kaufman.

852
00:57:47,975 --> 00:57:51,877
Fat, old, bald, repulsive, sitting in
a Hollywood restaurant...

853
00:57:52,046 --> 00:57:57,074
...across from Valerie Thomas,
a lovely, statuesque film executive.

854
00:57:57,251 --> 00:58:00,084
Kaufman, trying to get
a writing assignment...

855
00:58:00,254 --> 00:58:03,280
...wanting to impress her,
sweats profusely.

856
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:11,894
Fat, bald Kaufman paces furiously
in his bedroom.

857
00:58:12,066 --> 00:58:15,627
He speaks into his hand-held
tape recorder, and he says:

858
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:20,435
"Charlie Kaufman, fat, bald,
repulsive, old...

859
00:58:20,608 --> 00:58:23,099
...sits at a Hollywood restaurant
with Valerie Thomas."

860
00:58:23,277 --> 00:58:25,040
Kaufman, repugnant, ridiculous...

861
00:58:25,212 --> 00:58:27,442
...jerks off to the book jacket photo
of Susan Or--

862
00:58:27,848 --> 00:58:29,372
What do you want?

863
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:31,142
I've finished my script.

864
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:33,419
I'm done.

865
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,149
So would you show it to your agent?

866
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,721
It's called The Three.

867
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,630
Thanks. I also want to
thank you for your idea.

868
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:50,862
It was very helpful.
I changed it a little.

869
00:58:51,038 --> 00:58:54,667
Now the killer cuts off body pieces
and makes his victims eat them.

870
00:58:54,842 --> 00:58:58,073
Caroline has this great tattoo of a snake
swallowing its own tail, and--

871
00:58:58,245 --> 00:59:01,305
- Ourobouros.
- I don't know what that means.

872
00:59:01,482 --> 00:59:03,712
The snake. It's called Ourobouros.

873
00:59:03,884 --> 00:59:07,251
I don't think so. But it's cool for my
killer to have this modus operandi...

874
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:10,254
...because when he forces the woman
who's really him to eat herself...

875
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:12,085
...he's also eating himself to death.

876
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:13,590
I'm insane.

877
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:16,859
- I'm Ourobouros.
- I don't know what that word means.

878
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:20,831
- I've written myself into my screenplay.
- That's kind of weird, huh?

879
00:59:21,002 --> 00:59:23,903
It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic.

880
00:59:24,071 --> 00:59:26,539
It's solipsistic. It's pathetic.

881
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:28,675
I'm pathetic.
I'm fat and pathetic.

882
00:59:28,843 --> 00:59:32,404
I'm sure you had good reasons, Charles.
You're an artist.

883
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:35,777
It's because I'm too timid to speak to
the woman who wrote the book.

884
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:37,815
Because I'm pathetic.

885
00:59:37,985 --> 00:59:41,978
Because I have no idea how to write.
Because I can't make flowers fascinating.

886
00:59:42,657 --> 00:59:44,147
Because I suck.

887
00:59:44,325 --> 00:59:47,294
- Hey, am I in the script?
- I'm going to New York.

888
00:59:48,362 --> 00:59:50,887
I'll meet her. That's it.
That's what I have to do.

889
00:59:51,065 --> 00:59:52,760
Don't get mad at me for saying this...

890
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:55,231
...but Bob's having a seminar
in New York this weekend.

891
00:59:55,403 --> 00:59:57,234
So if you're stuck....

892
00:59:58,039 --> 00:59:58,172
And she said,
"Laroche is such a fun character."

893
00:59:58,172 --> 01:00:01,938
And she said,
"Laroche is such a fun character."

894
01:00:02,109 --> 01:00:04,441
No shit, I'm a fun character.

895
01:00:04,612 --> 01:00:05,874
Who's gonna play me?

896
01:00:06,047 --> 01:00:08,208
Well, I've gotta write
the book first, John.

897
01:00:08,382 --> 01:00:11,215
Then, you know, they get somebody
to write the screenplay.

898
01:00:11,385 --> 01:00:13,615
Hey, I think I should play me.

899
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:19,288
Most people yearn for something
exceptional, something so inspiring...

900
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,591
...that they'd want to risk everything
for that passion, but few would act on it.

901
01:00:24,765 --> 01:00:27,928
It was very powerful...

902
01:00:28,102 --> 01:00:32,436
...and it's intoxicating to be
around someone so alive.

903
01:00:32,606 --> 01:00:35,541
Come on, just follow me.
They're right nearby.

904
01:00:35,876 --> 01:00:37,400
Okay.

905
01:00:48,489 --> 01:00:50,787
Can I ask you a personal question?

906
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:53,688
Look, we're not lost.

907
01:01:14,248 --> 01:01:16,580
I've done this a million times.

908
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:20,983
When everything is killing me, I just say,
"Screw it," and go straight ahead.

909
01:01:30,097 --> 01:01:31,689
Oh, fuck....

910
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:38,738
Sundial.

911
01:01:39,774 --> 01:01:42,766
I'll just set this up,
we'll wait a few minutes...

912
01:01:42,943 --> 01:01:46,071
...and then we'll be able to tell
which way the sun's moving.

913
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:48,807
We should be headed southeast.

914
01:01:53,454 --> 01:01:56,548
So, you collect anything?

915
01:01:56,724 --> 01:01:58,589
Not really, no.

916
01:01:59,426 --> 01:02:01,724
Yeah, well, you know...

917
01:02:01,896 --> 01:02:04,626
...it's not really about
collecting the thing.

918
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,200
It's about being able....

919
01:02:10,671 --> 01:02:13,003
The thing about computers,
the thing I like...

920
01:02:13,174 --> 01:02:14,698
...is that I'm immersed in them...

921
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:19,574
...but it's not like a living thing
that's gonna leave or die or something.

922
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,250
- John, I'm sorry. I just--
- Okay.

923
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,058
- I don't--
- Hey. Okay.

924
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:33,853
Fuck the sundial.

925
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:37,020
I know how to get out of here.
I know how to get out of here.

926
01:02:37,198 --> 01:02:40,099
I know this swamp like
the back of my goddamn hand.

927
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:42,861
You're just like everybody else.
Fucking leeches.

928
01:02:43,037 --> 01:02:47,030
You just attach yourself to me
and suck me dry, spit me out.

929
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:50,439
Why don't you get your own fucking life?
Your own fucking interests?

930
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:53,079
Fucking spoiled bitch.

931
01:02:58,385 --> 01:03:03,948
Life seemed to be filled with things
that were just like the ghost orchid.

932
01:03:04,124 --> 01:03:08,561
Wonderful to imagine
and easy to fall in love with...

933
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:11,663
...but a little fantastic...

934
01:03:11,832 --> 01:03:13,629
...and fleeting...

935
01:03:14,368 --> 01:03:16,165
...and out of reach.

936
01:03:28,415 --> 01:03:32,647
"--but a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

937
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,282
Hello?

938
01:05:14,455 --> 01:05:16,389
Hey, it's Marty. How's it going?

939
01:05:16,557 --> 01:05:19,390
Has it been helpful talking to the writer?
What's her name?

940
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,858
Susan Orlean. It's been okay.

941
01:05:22,896 --> 01:05:25,490
Well, I mean, are you making headway?

942
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:27,691
Valerie's breathing down my neck.

943
01:05:28,669 --> 01:05:32,605
- You can't rush inspiration.
- Okay. All right. Fair enough.

944
01:05:32,773 --> 01:05:36,174
Listen, the other reason
I called was The Three.

945
01:05:36,977 --> 01:05:38,410
It's just amazing.

946
01:05:39,146 --> 01:05:41,637
- I don't know what that is.
- Donald's script.

947
01:05:41,815 --> 01:05:45,512
A smart, edgy thriller.
It's the best script I've read all year.

948
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:54,526
- Good.
- Yeah, I'm gonna sell it for a shitload.

949
01:05:54,695 --> 01:05:57,391
Two fucking talented guys in one family.

950
01:05:57,564 --> 01:06:01,159
In fact, maybe you could get your
brother to help you with the orchid thing.

951
01:06:01,335 --> 01:06:06,068
- Marty, don't say that. I mean--
- All right. It's just a thought, buddy.

952
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,835
I mean, he's really
goddamn amazing at structure.

953
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,308
- I have to go.
- All right. Adios, amigo.

954
01:06:12,479 --> 01:06:13,741
Finish that--

955
01:06:18,085 --> 01:06:19,518
Fuck!

956
01:06:28,962 --> 01:06:31,226
Okay, thank you, thank you.

957
01:06:31,398 --> 01:06:34,128
We have a long three days ahead.

958
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:38,795
Years from now, you'll be at a posh
cocktail party congratulating yourself...

959
01:06:38,972 --> 01:06:44,706
...on how you spent a weekend with
an asshole from Hollywood for your art.

960
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:48,205
- I am pathetic. I am a loser.
- So...

961
01:06:48,382 --> 01:06:50,714
...what is the substance of writing?

962
01:06:50,884 --> 01:06:54,183
I have failed. I am panicked.
I have sold out. I am worthless.

963
01:06:54,354 --> 01:06:57,118
l-- What the fuck am I doing here?

964
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:59,282
What the fuck am I doing here? Fuck!

965
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:03,692
It is my weakness, my ultimate lack
of conviction that brings me here.

966
01:07:03,864 --> 01:07:06,765
Easy answers,
rules to shortcut yourself to success.

967
01:07:06,934 --> 01:07:10,165
And here I am because my jaunt
into the abyss brought me nothing.

968
01:07:10,337 --> 01:07:13,431
Well, isn't that just the risk one takes
for attempting something new?

969
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:17,441
I should leave right now. I'll start over.
I need to face this project head-on--

970
01:07:17,611 --> 01:07:21,069
And God help you if you use
voice-over in your work, my friends.

971
01:07:21,248 --> 01:07:24,809
God help you.
It's flaccid, sloppy writing.

972
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,888
Any idiot can write voice-over narration
to explain the thoughts of the character.

973
01:07:30,057 --> 01:07:31,820
Okay, that's it.
One hour for lunch.

974
01:07:36,029 --> 01:07:38,930
You cannot have a protagonist
without desire.

975
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:42,762
It doesn't make any sense.
Any fucking sense.

976
01:07:43,704 --> 01:07:46,400
You follow? Good.

977
01:07:46,673 --> 01:07:48,038
Anyone else?

978
01:07:53,447 --> 01:07:58,180
What if a writer is attempting to create
a story where nothing much happens?

979
01:07:58,352 --> 01:08:01,685
Where people don't change,
they don't have any epiphanies.

980
01:08:01,855 --> 01:08:05,586
They struggle and are frustrated,
and nothing is resolved.

981
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,920
More a reflection of the real world.

982
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:10,291
The real world?

983
01:08:10,797 --> 01:08:12,025
Yes, sir.

984
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:14,326
The real fucking world.

985
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:18,164
First of all, you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis...

986
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:20,533
...you'll bore your audience to tears.

987
01:08:20,707 --> 01:08:24,404
Secondly, nothing happens in the world?

988
01:08:25,412 --> 01:08:28,210
Are you out of your fucking mind?

989
01:08:29,283 --> 01:08:31,308
People are murdered every day.

990
01:08:31,818 --> 01:08:34,616
There's genocide, war, corruption.

991
01:08:34,788 --> 01:08:37,416
Every fucking day,
somewhere in the world...

992
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:39,991
...somebody sacrifices his life
to save somebody else.

993
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,561
Every fucking day, someone somewhere
takes a conscious decision...

994
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:46,198
...to destroy someone else.

995
01:08:46,366 --> 01:08:48,630
People find love. People lose it.

996
01:08:48,802 --> 01:08:53,398
Christ, a child watches a mother
beaten to death on the steps of a church.

997
01:08:53,574 --> 01:08:55,041
Someone goes hungry.

998
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:58,508
Somebody else betrays
his best friend for a woman.

999
01:08:59,046 --> 01:09:01,480
If you can't find that stuff in life...

1000
01:09:01,648 --> 01:09:04,879
...then you, my friend,
don't know crap about life!

1001
01:09:05,052 --> 01:09:10,718
And why the fuck are you wasting
my two precious hours with your movie?

1002
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,684
I don't have any use for it!

1003
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,489
I don't have any bloody use for it!

1004
01:09:19,233 --> 01:09:20,700
Okay, thanks.

1005
01:09:24,371 --> 01:09:25,804
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1006
01:09:25,973 --> 01:09:27,304
No. Thank you.

1007
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,509
Thank you so much, Mr.McKee.

1008
01:09:30,744 --> 01:09:34,703
This course makes you look at writing
in a whole different way.

1009
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:38,148
- Mr.McKee.
- Yes?

1010
01:09:38,318 --> 01:09:41,617
I'm the guy you yelled at this morning.

1011
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:44,518
I need more.

1012
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:48,227
I'm the one who thought
things didn't happen in life.

1013
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,027
Right. Okay.

1014
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:53,393
- Nice to see you.
- I need to talk.

1015
01:09:55,269 --> 01:09:57,737
Mr.McKee, my even
standing here is very scary.

1016
01:09:57,904 --> 01:09:59,235
I don't meet people well.

1017
01:09:59,406 --> 01:10:01,966
But what you said this morning
shook me to the bone.

1018
01:10:02,142 --> 01:10:04,372
What you said was bigger than
my screenwriting choices.

1019
01:10:04,544 --> 01:10:07,843
It was about my choices
as a human being. Please.

1020
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:12,375
Yeah.

1021
01:10:13,253 --> 01:10:14,811
Well, you know...

1022
01:10:14,988 --> 01:10:17,752
...I could sure use a drink, my friend.

1023
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:23,756
"--but a little fantastic
and fleeting and out of reach."

1024
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,830
Then what happens?

1025
01:10:27,668 --> 01:10:29,636
Well, that's the end of the book.

1026
01:10:29,803 --> 01:10:31,430
I wanted to present it simply...

1027
01:10:31,605 --> 01:10:34,540
...without big character arcs
or sensationalizing the story.

1028
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:36,801
I wanted to show flowers
as God's miracles.

1029
01:10:36,977 --> 01:10:40,913
I wanted to show that Orlean
never saw the blooming ghost orchid.

1030
01:10:41,081 --> 01:10:42,776
It was about disappointment.

1031
01:10:44,918 --> 01:10:46,317
I see.

1032
01:10:47,888 --> 01:10:49,446
That's not a movie.

1033
01:10:49,956 --> 01:10:53,050
You gotta go back, put in the drama.

1034
01:10:54,227 --> 01:10:59,460
I can't go back. I've got pages of
false starts and wrong approaches.

1035
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:02,761
- I'm way past my deadline.
- I'll tell you a secret.

1036
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:07,336
A last act makes a film.

1037
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:11,366
Wow them in the end,
and you got a hit.

1038
01:11:11,545 --> 01:11:15,208
You can have flaws, problems,
but wow them in the end...

1039
01:11:16,016 --> 01:11:17,711
...and you've got a hit.

1040
01:11:18,652 --> 01:11:22,213
Find an ending.
But don't cheat.

1041
01:11:22,389 --> 01:11:25,756
And don't you dare bring in
a deus ex machina.

1042
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:30,559
Your characters must change...

1043
01:11:31,798 --> 01:11:34,460
...and the change must come from them.

1044
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,934
Do that and you'll be fine.

1045
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:43,502
You promise?

1046
01:11:45,946 --> 01:11:48,244
Mr.McKee.

1047
01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:54,084
- Have you taken my course before?
- My brother did.

1048
01:11:54,254 --> 01:11:57,621
My twin brother, Donald.
He's the one who got me to come.

1049
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,055
- Twin screenwriters?
- Yeah.

1050
01:12:00,227 --> 01:12:04,186
Well, Julius and Philip Epstein...

1051
01:12:04,364 --> 01:12:07,128
...who wrote Casablanca...

1052
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,235
- ...they were twins
- You mentioned that in class.

1053
01:12:11,271 --> 01:12:13,136
Finest screenplay ever written.

1054
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,367
Great writers' residence.

1055
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:18,033
- Donald.
- Hey, how's your trip going?

1056
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:20,839
You getting it on with that
lady journalist, you dog you?

1057
01:12:21,014 --> 01:12:22,174
Yeah.

1058
01:12:22,616 --> 01:12:25,676
Listen, I'm just calling to say
congratulations on your script.

1059
01:12:25,852 --> 01:12:30,721
Isn't that cool? Marty says he can
get me high-sixes against a mil-five.

1060
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,388
That's great, Donald.

1061
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:37,029
I want to thank you for all your help.

1062
01:12:37,197 --> 01:12:38,824
I wasn't any help.

1063
01:12:38,999 --> 01:12:41,194
Come on,
you let me stay in your place.

1064
01:12:41,368 --> 01:12:44,462
And your integrity
inspired me to even try.

1065
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:47,370
It's been a wild ride.

1066
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:49,566
Catherine says
she wants to play Cassie.

1067
01:12:49,743 --> 01:12:51,574
Oh, please!

1068
01:12:52,212 --> 01:12:53,736
Please, Donald?

1069
01:12:53,947 --> 01:12:55,380
Catherine Keener?

1070
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:59,385
- Catherine Keener's in my house?
- Yeah, we're playing Boggle.

1071
01:12:59,553 --> 01:13:02,351
She's so great. You should really
hang out with her, Charles.

1072
01:13:02,956 --> 01:13:05,083
Yeah. Look....

1073
01:13:06,126 --> 01:13:08,060
I've been thinking.

1074
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:15,394
Maybe you'd be interested in hanging
out with me for a few days in New York.

1075
01:13:15,569 --> 01:13:17,662
Oh, my God, yes.

1076
01:13:17,838 --> 01:13:18,998
Yeah?

1077
01:13:19,172 --> 01:13:21,402
I was gonna show my script
to some people...

1078
01:13:21,575 --> 01:13:25,409
...and, well, maybe you could
read it too, you know, if you like.

1079
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:28,104
Of course. I'd be flattered.

1080
01:13:29,983 --> 01:13:31,382
Okay.

1081
01:13:31,551 --> 01:13:33,382
Thanks, Charles.

1082
01:13:33,553 --> 01:13:34,850
Okay, bye.

1083
01:13:48,101 --> 01:13:50,661
So, like, what would you do?

1084
01:13:51,037 --> 01:13:53,062
The script kind of makes fun of me, huh?

1085
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,573
- I'm sorry. I was trying something--
- Hey, I don't mind. It's funny.

1086
01:13:56,743 --> 01:13:57,903
Good. Okay.

1087
01:13:58,612 --> 01:14:00,637
So, what would you do?

1088
01:14:02,215 --> 01:14:05,651
You and me are so different, Charles.
We're different talents.

1089
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:07,309
I know. Just for fun...

1090
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,682
...how would the great Donald
end this script?

1091
01:14:09,856 --> 01:14:12,757
Shut up. "The great Donald."

1092
01:14:14,794 --> 01:14:16,762
I feel like you're missing something.

1093
01:14:18,765 --> 01:14:20,460
- All right. Like what?
- Look.

1094
01:14:24,104 --> 01:14:26,436
I did a little research on the airplane.

1095
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:31,807
"Sometimes this kind of story turns out
to be something more...

1096
01:14:31,978 --> 01:14:34,344
...some glimpse of life that expands...

1097
01:14:34,514 --> 01:14:37,347
...like those Japanese paper balls
you drop in water...

1098
01:14:37,517 --> 01:14:41,112
...and they bloom into flowers
and the flower is so marvelous...

1099
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:44,314
...you can't believe there was a time
all you saw in front of you...

1100
01:14:44,491 --> 01:14:46,459
...was a paper ball and a glass of water."

1101
01:14:46,626 --> 01:14:50,357
Well, first of all, that's inconsistent.
She said she didn't care about flowers.

1102
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,795
- For God's sake, it's just a metaphor.
- Well, but for what?

1103
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:58,030
What turned that paper ball into
a flower? It's not in the book, Charles.

1104
01:14:58,204 --> 01:15:00,604
- I don't know. You're reaching.
- Maybe.

1105
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:05,006
But I think you actually need to speak
to this woman. To know her.

1106
01:15:06,713 --> 01:15:08,237
I can't.

1107
01:15:09,883 --> 01:15:11,874
- Really.
- I'll go.

1108
01:15:12,218 --> 01:15:13,810
I'll pretend I'm you.

1109
01:15:14,387 --> 01:15:15,786
I want to do it, Charles.

1110
01:15:15,956 --> 01:15:19,619
We'll get to the bottom of this.
We're gonna fix your movie, bro.

1111
01:15:22,662 --> 01:15:24,892
But you've gotta be exactly me.

1112
01:15:25,498 --> 01:15:27,489
I have a reputation to maintain.

1113
01:15:28,335 --> 01:15:30,462
You can't be a goofball.
You can't be an asshole.

1114
01:15:30,637 --> 01:15:32,537
- I'm not an asshole.
- You know what I mean.

1115
01:15:32,706 --> 01:15:36,005
No flirting. No bad jokes.

1116
01:15:36,176 --> 01:15:38,440
Don't laugh how you laugh.

1117
01:15:38,612 --> 01:15:42,639
I'm not gonna laugh.
I get to have people think I'm you.

1118
01:15:42,816 --> 01:15:44,408
It's an honor.

1119
01:15:48,221 --> 01:15:50,883
So I guess I'll bring out
the big guns now.

1120
01:15:52,092 --> 01:15:53,719
Do you keep in touch with Laroche?

1121
01:15:54,894 --> 01:16:01,026
I felt I detected an attraction to him
in the subtext. Care to comment?

1122
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:07,330
Well, our relationship
was strictly reporter-subject.

1123
01:16:07,507 --> 01:16:13,707
I mean, certainly an intimacy does
evolve in this kind of relationship.

1124
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:18,374
By definition, I was so interested
in everything he had to say.

1125
01:16:19,552 --> 01:16:22,749
But the relationship ends
when the book ends.

1126
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,455
- Mendacious deceit.
- What?

1127
01:16:29,629 --> 01:16:30,960
Nothing.

1128
01:16:31,464 --> 01:16:33,091
I just have one more question.

1129
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:40,501
If you could have dinner with one
historical personage, living or dead...

1130
01:16:40,674 --> 01:16:42,141
...who would it be?

1131
01:16:43,109 --> 01:16:45,543
Well, I would have to say...

1132
01:16:46,212 --> 01:16:48,840
...Einstein.

1133
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:51,315
Or Jesus.

1134
01:16:52,752 --> 01:16:54,515
Very good.

1135
01:16:54,688 --> 01:16:56,155
Interesting answer.

1136
01:16:59,559 --> 01:17:01,993
- She's lying.
- What do you mean?

1137
01:17:02,162 --> 01:17:04,960
- What happened?
- Nothing. She said everything right.

1138
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:09,857
- Too right.
- Well, maybe because they're true.

1139
01:17:10,236 --> 01:17:11,464
Did you embarrass me?

1140
01:17:11,638 --> 01:17:13,765
People who answer questions
too right are liars.

1141
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,239
And everybody says Jesus and Einstein.
That's a prepackaged answer.

1142
01:17:17,844 --> 01:17:20,677
- "Jesus and Einstein"?
- Listen, Charles, I have an idea.

1143
01:17:20,847 --> 01:17:22,906
You'll need to buy me
a pair of binoculars.

1144
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,675
What's "Jesus and Einstein"?

1145
01:17:27,087 --> 01:17:28,349
Come on.

1146
01:17:31,124 --> 01:17:32,386
Sing with me.

1147
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:39,589
What the hell
do you need binoculars for?

1148
01:17:41,434 --> 01:17:43,368
Let's go, let's go.

1149
01:17:44,437 --> 01:17:46,997
She hung up the phone.
She's upset.

1150
01:17:47,173 --> 01:17:49,232
Stop watching her.
Leave her alone.

1151
01:17:49,409 --> 01:17:51,138
She's crying.

1152
01:17:52,712 --> 01:17:54,976
She's at her computer.

1153
01:17:55,148 --> 01:17:57,048
This is morally reprehensible.

1154
01:17:57,217 --> 01:17:58,980
United...

1155
01:17:59,552 --> 01:18:01,076
...to Miami.

1156
01:18:02,422 --> 01:18:03,980
Eleven...

1157
01:18:04,157 --> 01:18:06,682
...fifty-five a.m. tomorrow.

1158
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:10,629
- I thought she was done with Laroche.
- Her parents live in Florida.

1159
01:18:10,797 --> 01:18:13,322
That was no parent phone call,
my friend.

1160
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,899
Don't say "my friend."

1161
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:16,729
A guy entering.

1162
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,567
Handsome.

1163
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:23,073
Must be her husband.

1164
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:26,408
She's acting weird
with him, though, right?

1165
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,379
Don't you think?

1166
01:18:32,018 --> 01:18:34,680
What's she hiding from him?

1167
01:18:37,323 --> 01:18:39,791
Maybe she's a lesbian
and doesn't know how to tell him.

1168
01:18:39,959 --> 01:18:41,256
What do you think?

1169
01:18:42,829 --> 01:18:44,626
Have you checked out
Laroche's porn site?

1170
01:18:44,798 --> 01:18:46,698
No. I'm trying to read.

1171
01:18:46,866 --> 01:18:48,891
Anyway, I'm gonna look
at the porn site.

1172
01:18:49,068 --> 01:18:50,865
Research.

1173
01:18:51,738 --> 01:18:53,603
- Don't tell my old lady.
- You mean Mom?

1174
01:18:53,773 --> 01:18:55,365
No, I don't mean Mom.

1175
01:18:57,811 --> 01:18:59,676
I still say we should go
to Miami tomorrow.

1176
01:18:59,846 --> 01:19:00,835
Forget it.

1177
01:19:01,014 --> 01:19:03,209
Some of these chicks look okay.

1178
01:19:03,383 --> 01:19:05,578
Hey, guess what.
We're going to Miami tomorrow.

1179
01:19:05,752 --> 01:19:09,518
- I said, no.
- I said, oh, yeah, baby. Come here.

1180
01:19:28,775 --> 01:19:33,974
What I came to understand
is that change is not a choice.

1181
01:19:34,147 --> 01:19:38,140
Not for a species of plant,
and not for me.

1182
01:19:38,318 --> 01:19:42,277
It happens, and you are different.

1183
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:46,620
Maybe the only distinction
between the plant and me...

1184
01:19:46,793 --> 01:19:49,387
...is that afterward,
I lied about my change.

1185
01:19:49,562 --> 01:19:53,054
I lied in my book.
I pretended with my husband...

1186
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:55,963
...that everything was the same.

1187
01:19:56,135 --> 01:19:59,593
But something happened
in the swamp that day.

1188
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:04,104
Hey, look.

1189
01:20:04,577 --> 01:20:07,603
I told you I'd find
the jewel of the Fakahatchee.

1190
01:20:13,853 --> 01:20:15,320
It's a flower.

1191
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:18,687
Just a flower.

1192
01:20:19,993 --> 01:20:22,086
Well, might as well grab it.

1193
01:20:22,262 --> 01:20:24,093
Long as I'm here.

1194
01:20:33,006 --> 01:20:34,132
Oh, man.

1195
01:20:43,283 --> 01:20:45,683
Boy, my porn site's gonna be big.

1196
01:20:51,858 --> 01:20:55,055
Look, something I didn't tell you...

1197
01:20:55,228 --> 01:20:58,686
...that I want to tell you about the ghost.
Okay?

1198
01:21:00,433 --> 01:21:02,196
I think it might help you.

1199
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:06,698
I'd just started at the nursery.

1200
01:21:07,974 --> 01:21:10,670
And I went back one night
to pick up something.

1201
01:21:30,063 --> 01:21:33,089
They wanted the ghost
just to extract the drug.

1202
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,565
It had been a ceremonial thing...

1203
01:21:35,735 --> 01:21:38,568
...but the young guys, you know,
they liked to get stoned.

1204
01:21:38,738 --> 01:21:40,137
So Matthew...?

1205
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:42,468
- He was one of the guys who--?
- Sure.

1206
01:21:42,642 --> 01:21:45,406
Matthew lived on that shit
till they ran out.

1207
01:21:45,578 --> 01:21:49,571
Because there was this one day
he was fascinated by me.

1208
01:21:49,749 --> 01:21:54,152
By my hair and my sadness.

1209
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,289
Yeah, well, it does that.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1210
01:21:57,457 --> 01:22:03,054
I mean, I think you'd like it, Susie.
It seems to help people be fascinated.

1211
01:22:03,663 --> 01:22:06,291
You know, I can extract it for you.
I know how. I watched.

1212
01:22:06,466 --> 01:22:09,162
I'm probably the only white guy
who knows.

1213
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:11,961
I want to do this, Susie.

1214
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,771
I'm done with orchids, Laroche.

1215
01:23:39,692 --> 01:23:41,557
- Hello?
- Hi.

1216
01:23:41,727 --> 01:23:43,285
It's John.

1217
01:23:43,463 --> 01:23:45,727
Did you get my package?

1218
01:23:46,265 --> 01:23:47,425
John?

1219
01:23:48,568 --> 01:23:50,092
John!

1220
01:23:51,504 --> 01:23:52,801
Johnny.

1221
01:23:54,707 --> 01:23:56,834
- Hey, John?
- Yeah?

1222
01:24:02,982 --> 01:24:04,779
Very happy now.

1223
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:06,818
Well, I'm glad.

1224
01:24:09,822 --> 01:24:11,187
Very happy.

1225
01:24:16,496 --> 01:24:18,088
Will you go like this--?

1226
01:24:28,407 --> 01:24:30,466
No. Keep going.

1227
01:24:37,016 --> 01:24:38,483
No. No.

1228
01:24:41,988 --> 01:24:45,151
I'm trying to make a dial tone.
And you have to sustain.

1229
01:24:45,324 --> 01:24:47,884
And then I will join you, and together--

1230
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:51,291
- See, I can't do it by myself.
- Which one do you want me to do?

1231
01:24:53,599 --> 01:24:55,794
- Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Okay. Here we go.

1232
01:25:04,844 --> 01:25:06,641
- That's it.
- We got it.

1233
01:25:06,812 --> 01:25:10,304
We got it. That's fucking amazing.

1234
01:25:12,852 --> 01:25:15,685
Do you ever get
lonely sometimes, Johnny?

1235
01:25:17,089 --> 01:25:19,114
Well, I was a weird kid.

1236
01:25:20,793 --> 01:25:22,590
Nobody liked me.

1237
01:25:24,063 --> 01:25:26,224
But I had this idea...

1238
01:25:28,267 --> 01:25:30,827
...if I waited long
enough, someone would...

1239
01:25:31,971 --> 01:25:34,166
...come around and just...

1240
01:25:35,174 --> 01:25:38,507
...you know, understand me.

1241
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,184
Like my mom.

1242
01:25:49,622 --> 01:25:51,715
Except someone else.

1243
01:25:53,559 --> 01:25:59,429
She'd look at me and quietly say:

1244
01:26:00,499 --> 01:26:01,761
"Yes."

1245
01:26:03,836 --> 01:26:05,895
Just like that.

1246
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:10,935
And I wouldn't be alone anymore.

1247
01:26:25,424 --> 01:26:28,257
I wish I were an ant.

1248
01:26:29,962 --> 01:26:32,192
They're so shiny.

1249
01:26:35,301 --> 01:26:37,360
You're shinier than any ant, darling.

1250
01:26:39,205 --> 01:26:43,039
That's the sweetest thing
anybody has ever said to me.

1251
01:26:43,209 --> 01:26:44,437
Well...

1252
01:26:45,077 --> 01:26:46,977
...I like you, that's why.

1253
01:26:54,687 --> 01:26:55,881
Hey.

1254
01:27:36,495 --> 01:27:38,690
I don't have time for that.

1255
01:27:50,476 --> 01:27:54,469
I'll get a closer look. You wait here.

1256
01:28:01,954 --> 01:28:03,717
No, wait!

1257
01:28:06,092 --> 01:28:07,457
I should go.

1258
01:28:07,793 --> 01:28:10,523
I mean, it should be me, right?

1259
01:28:10,696 --> 01:28:11,993
I mean...

1260
01:28:12,565 --> 01:28:13,896
...it's my....

1261
01:28:15,234 --> 01:28:16,826
- I was, you know--
- Go for it, bro.

1262
01:28:17,002 --> 01:28:18,799
You're the man.

1263
01:29:22,134 --> 01:29:23,601
Rip them.

1264
01:29:24,303 --> 01:29:25,634
Just rip them.

1265
01:29:48,294 --> 01:29:50,854
Darling, I don't know
what's come over you.

1266
01:29:51,363 --> 01:29:56,198
You came all over me last time
I was here, as I recall.

1267
01:30:22,394 --> 01:30:24,885
Goddamn!

1268
01:30:25,064 --> 01:30:26,531
Hey! Fuck.

1269
01:30:27,867 --> 01:30:29,129
Get in here!

1270
01:30:29,301 --> 01:30:32,293
Shut the fuck up, now!
Sit the fuck down!

1271
01:30:32,805 --> 01:30:34,898
- Who is that, Johnny?
- Who the fuck are you?

1272
01:30:35,074 --> 01:30:36,735
I just--
Nobody.

1273
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:40,640
- I just-- I'm just--
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1274
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:43,779
He's that screenwriter.

1275
01:30:45,084 --> 01:30:48,576
- The guy that's adapting our book?
- Yeah.

1276
01:30:51,690 --> 01:30:53,214
Well, that's wild.

1277
01:30:53,392 --> 01:30:55,257
It's nice to meet you.

1278
01:30:57,530 --> 01:30:59,259
Hey, dude...

1279
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:03,458
- ...who's gonna play me?
- I don't know that. I should--

1280
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:05,762
Well, I thought I should play me.

1281
01:31:05,938 --> 01:31:07,200
Why--?

1282
01:31:07,373 --> 01:31:10,069
- Did he follow me?
- No, of course not. I should go.

1283
01:31:10,242 --> 01:31:13,507
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
it was nice to meet you...

1284
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:15,772
...but let me give you my number.

1285
01:31:15,948 --> 01:31:19,179
I'm really freaking here, Johnny.
Why is he here?

1286
01:31:19,652 --> 01:31:21,244
Why did he follow me?

1287
01:31:21,754 --> 01:31:24,848
- What does he know?
- I don't know anything about anything.

1288
01:31:25,024 --> 01:31:27,492
- He did see the greenhouse.
- Oh, shit.

1289
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,059
Oh, shit.

1290
01:31:29,562 --> 01:31:31,928
Are you gonna write about this
in your screenplay?

1291
01:31:32,097 --> 01:31:34,156
I really don't know what "this" is.

1292
01:31:36,635 --> 01:31:38,398
He's lying.

1293
01:31:39,138 --> 01:31:41,106
- Hold him.
- Stay! Just--

1294
01:32:17,343 --> 01:32:18,810
We have to kill him.

1295
01:32:18,978 --> 01:32:20,809
- What?
- What are we supposed to do?

1296
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,538
- What can we do?
- Sit the fuck down!

1297
01:32:29,588 --> 01:32:31,055
Susie...

1298
01:32:31,423 --> 01:32:33,323
...you gotta calm down.

1299
01:32:33,492 --> 01:32:35,722
Now, you're getting a little emotional.

1300
01:32:35,894 --> 01:32:38,454
- You don't know--
- I can't have him writing about me.

1301
01:32:38,631 --> 01:32:42,931
I can't have the whole world,
all the people knowing about us...

1302
01:32:43,102 --> 01:32:45,036
...and about this.

1303
01:32:47,106 --> 01:32:48,573
Why?

1304
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:51,570
- You ashamed of me, Susie?
- No, that's not it.

1305
01:32:51,744 --> 01:32:53,871
- No. How can you even think of that?
- Well--

1306
01:32:54,046 --> 01:32:57,209
I'm a professional journalist,
and the drugs and--

1307
01:33:00,085 --> 01:33:01,916
We can't kill anyone.

1308
01:33:02,121 --> 01:33:04,055
Okay. Okay.

1309
01:33:04,223 --> 01:33:06,248
Then I'll do it.

1310
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:08,092
By myself.

1311
01:33:08,293 --> 01:33:10,727
- Susan--
- Hey! Come on. Fucking get down!

1312
01:33:10,896 --> 01:33:13,456
- I wouldn't tell any--
- Put him in his fucking car!

1313
01:33:59,244 --> 01:34:02,077
Turn it off. Just get out.

1314
01:34:31,543 --> 01:34:33,511
Run! Run! Go!

1315
01:34:35,414 --> 01:34:37,541
Susan! What the fuck was that?

1316
01:34:37,716 --> 01:34:43,052
- I don't know. I couldn't see.
- Shit. Fuck!

1317
01:34:43,288 --> 01:34:45,722
Come on! Help me find the flashlight.

1318
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,811
So it was a guy?

1319
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:21,482
Yeah. Fat.

1320
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:24,151
That's all I could tell.

1321
01:35:29,968 --> 01:35:32,402
This is ridiculous.
We're gonna have to split up.

1322
01:35:32,571 --> 01:35:37,873
I can't. I can't be by myself out here.
I'm not gonna do that.

1323
01:35:40,145 --> 01:35:43,137
- They're gonna find us.
- I don't think so.

1324
01:35:43,515 --> 01:35:47,246
I don't want to die, Donald.
I've wasted my life. God, I've wasted it.

1325
01:35:47,419 --> 01:35:51,253
- You did not. And you're not gonna die.
- I wasted it.

1326
01:35:51,423 --> 01:35:53,357
I admire you, Donald, you know?

1327
01:35:53,525 --> 01:35:57,120
I spent my whole life paralyzed,
worrying about what people think of me...

1328
01:35:57,296 --> 01:36:01,392
- ...and you, you're just oblivious.
- I'm not oblivious.

1329
01:36:01,967 --> 01:36:05,767
No, you don't understand.
I mean that as a compliment.

1330
01:36:08,507 --> 01:36:10,737
There was this time in high school.

1331
01:36:10,909 --> 01:36:13,935
I was watching you out
the library window...

1332
01:36:14,112 --> 01:36:17,843
- ...you were talking to Sarah Marsh.
- Oh, God, I was so in love with her.

1333
01:36:18,016 --> 01:36:23,181
I know. And you were flirting with her,
and she was being really sweet to you.

1334
01:36:23,355 --> 01:36:27,155
- I remember that.
- And then, when you walked away...

1335
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,792
...she started making fun of you
with Kim Canetti.

1336
01:36:32,164 --> 01:36:36,294
And it was like
they were laughing at me.

1337
01:36:38,136 --> 01:36:40,331
You didn't know at all?

1338
01:36:41,807 --> 01:36:46,267
- You seemed so happy.
- I knew. I heard them.

1339
01:36:47,746 --> 01:36:49,407
Well, how come you were so happy?

1340
01:36:51,383 --> 01:36:54,011
I loved Sarah, Charles.

1341
01:36:55,487 --> 01:37:00,356
It was mine, that love.

1342
01:37:01,994 --> 01:37:04,053
I owned it.

1343
01:37:06,865 --> 01:37:10,596
Even Sarah didn't have
the right to take it away.

1344
01:37:12,404 --> 01:37:15,134
I can love whoever I want.

1345
01:37:17,709 --> 01:37:20,269
But she thought you were pathetic.

1346
01:37:24,783 --> 01:37:27,149
That was her business, not mine.

1347
01:37:30,255 --> 01:37:35,215
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

1348
01:37:37,596 --> 01:37:40,724
That's what I decided a long time ago.

1349
01:37:53,946 --> 01:37:55,880
What's up?

1350
01:37:57,883 --> 01:37:59,851
Thank you.

1351
01:38:01,053 --> 01:38:03,283
For what?

1352
01:38:12,698 --> 01:38:14,859
No, shh!

1353
01:38:15,133 --> 01:38:17,863
Listen. I hear them.

1354
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:21,369
I hear them. I hear them breathing.

1355
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:29,445
Charlie?

1356
01:38:30,615 --> 01:38:33,209
- Charlie?
- Charlie!

1357
01:38:33,385 --> 01:38:36,047
- Guys?
- Charlie!

1358
01:38:36,221 --> 01:38:37,984
Charlie!

1359
01:39:11,223 --> 01:39:13,157
Where's the van?

1360
01:39:14,259 --> 01:39:19,026
- Are they gone?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1361
01:39:47,325 --> 01:39:49,452
John? John!

1362
01:39:58,003 --> 01:39:59,470
Shit!

1363
01:40:20,625 --> 01:40:23,492
I can't believe I got shot.
Isn't that fucked up?

1364
01:40:23,695 --> 01:40:25,720
Shut up. Stop laughing.

1365
01:40:53,992 --> 01:40:58,190
Donald? You're gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Donald.

1366
01:40:58,663 --> 01:41:02,929
Just don't go to sleep. Just don't
go to sleep, Donald. Look at me.

1367
01:41:03,468 --> 01:41:05,834
Look at me, Donald.
Keep looking at me.

1368
01:41:06,004 --> 01:41:09,030
Open your eyes.
Donald, please open your eyes.

1369
01:41:09,207 --> 01:41:12,870
Donald. Donald, please
open your eyes, Donald.

1370
01:41:13,078 --> 01:41:15,945
Donald! Donald, open your eyes!

1371
01:41:37,736 --> 01:41:39,363
Look at me.

1372
01:41:53,451 --> 01:41:54,975
Help!

1373
01:42:04,429 --> 01:42:05,828
John!

1374
01:42:37,162 --> 01:42:38,686
Halt!

1375
01:43:08,627 --> 01:43:10,891
I'm sorry.

1376
01:43:11,062 --> 01:43:13,553
Now I have to do this too.

1377
01:43:14,633 --> 01:43:16,863
I'm not a killer.

1378
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:20,164
You put yourself in--

1379
01:43:25,477 --> 01:43:26,876
Johnny!

1380
01:43:29,781 --> 01:43:31,715
- Help!
- No, no!

1381
01:43:33,852 --> 01:43:39,017
Johnny! Johnny! John!

1382
01:43:52,504 --> 01:43:54,563
Oh, no, no, no.

1383
01:44:04,749 --> 01:44:09,209
Oh, God. You fat piece of shit!

1384
01:44:10,555 --> 01:44:13,319
- He's dead, you loser!
- Shut up!

1385
01:44:13,491 --> 01:44:16,187
- You ruined my life, you fat fuck!
- Shut up! Shut up!

1386
01:44:16,394 --> 01:44:22,333
Fuck you, lady! You're just a lonely,
old, desperate, pathetic drug addict!

1387
01:44:33,044 --> 01:44:36,138
Oh, my God.

1388
01:44:38,183 --> 01:44:43,246
It's over. Everything's over.

1389
01:44:43,855 --> 01:44:46,085
I did everything wrong.

1390
01:44:49,394 --> 01:44:52,124
I want my life back.

1391
01:44:52,297 --> 01:44:56,165
I want it back before it all got fucked up.

1392
01:44:56,334 --> 01:45:01,294
I want to be a baby again.
I want to be new.

1393
01:45:01,673 --> 01:45:04,665
I want to be new.

1394
01:45:36,775 --> 01:45:38,800
Hello?

1395
01:45:41,413 --> 01:45:43,904
- Hello?
- Mom.

1396
01:45:44,082 --> 01:45:48,781
Charles? Charles, is that you?

1397
01:45:53,525 --> 01:45:56,494
Charles, what's the matter? You okay?

1398
01:46:18,016 --> 01:46:22,282
Donald says,
"That was her business, not mine.

1399
01:46:22,454 --> 01:46:26,220
You are what you love,
not what loves you.

1400
01:46:26,691 --> 01:46:29,683
I decided that a long time ago."

1401
01:46:30,261 --> 01:46:32,729
Kaufman starts to cry.

1402
01:46:32,897 --> 01:46:37,596
He tries to thank his brother,
but he can't put it into words.

1403
01:46:39,604 --> 01:46:43,472
- So how you getting on?
- I'm okay.

1404
01:46:46,945 --> 01:46:48,242
I miss him, you know?

1405
01:46:50,815 --> 01:46:53,909
- How's the script coming?
- It's good. I'm almost finished.

1406
01:46:54,085 --> 01:46:56,610
I'll be really glad to move on
to something else.

1407
01:46:56,821 --> 01:46:58,448
I'll bet.

1408
01:46:59,991 --> 01:47:01,686
Things okay with you?

1409
01:47:01,893 --> 01:47:06,489
And then in January, David and I went
to Prague. That was a high point.

1410
01:47:06,664 --> 01:47:09,758
- That sounds great.
- There's amazing puppet theater there.

1411
01:47:09,934 --> 01:47:11,834
Yeah, I've heard. I've gotta see that.

1412
01:47:12,003 --> 01:47:18,135
And there's this church decorated
with, like, human skulls and bones.

1413
01:47:18,309 --> 01:47:21,904
Forty thousand skulls and bones.

1414
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:25,112
I thought about you when I went there.

1415
01:47:47,539 --> 01:47:50,906
Charlie, I'm with someone.
Why are you doing this now?

1416
01:47:54,612 --> 01:47:56,580
I love you.

1417
01:48:02,921 --> 01:48:06,755
I should go. I have to....

1418
01:48:06,925 --> 01:48:10,884
Stuff I have to do.
I'm going away this weekend....

1419
01:48:11,062 --> 01:48:14,862
- Million things, okay?
- Yeah.

1420
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:31,540
I love you too, you know.

1421
01:48:51,536 --> 01:48:55,063
I have to go right home.
I know how to finish the script now.

1422
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:58,140
It ends with Kaufman driving home
after his lunch with Amelia...

1423
01:48:58,309 --> 01:49:00,869
...thinking he knows
how to finish the script.

1424
01:49:01,045 --> 01:49:03,980
Shit, that's voice-over.
McKee would not approve.

1425
01:49:04,148 --> 01:49:07,276
How else can I show his thoughts?
I don't know.

1426
01:49:07,452 --> 01:49:10,615
Well, who cares what McKee says?
It feels right.

1427
01:49:10,788 --> 01:49:12,722
Conclusive.

1428
01:49:12,890 --> 01:49:16,451
I wonder who's gonna play me.
Someone not too fat.

1429
01:49:16,628 --> 01:49:20,029
I like that Gerard Depardieu,
but can he not do the accent?

1430
01:49:20,198 --> 01:49:24,532
Anyway, it's done.
And that's something.

1431
01:49:24,702 --> 01:49:29,435
So: "Kaufman drives off from
his encounter with Amelia...

1432
01:49:29,607 --> 01:49:32,838
...filled for the first time with hope."

1433
01:49:33,678 --> 01:49:35,703
I like this.

1434
01:49:36,447 --> 01:49:38,381
This is good.
