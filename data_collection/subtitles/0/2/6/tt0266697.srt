1
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:49,136
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:55,375 --> 00:01:01,975
You know, I bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

3
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,175
If I wanted to.

4
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,534
You know, kiddo...

5
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:15,694
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

6
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:21,733
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

7
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:27,413
We, maybe towards
those other jokers.

8
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,773
But not you.

9
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,252
No, kiddo.

10
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:37,172
At this moment...

11
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:45,612
This is me at my most
masochistic.

12
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:49,531
Bill, it's your baby.

13
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,277
Coming!

14
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:00,877
Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

15
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:04,072
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

16
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:06,832
Got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

17
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:18,071
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

18
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,991
Come on.
Bring it on.

19
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:01,108
Mommy, I'm home.

20
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:02,668
Hey, baby.

21
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,588
How was school?

22
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:09,468
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

23
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:11,387
Oh.

24
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:13,787
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

25
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,187
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

26
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,747
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

27
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:20,987
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

28
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:25,186
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

29
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:33,906
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

30
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:35,826
Hi, honey.

31
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:37,545
I'm [beep]

32
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,825
What's your name?

33
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:44,265
Her name is Nikki.

34
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:45,905
Nikki.

35
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,465
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

36
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:52,824
How old are you, Nikki?

37
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:59,824
Nikki, [beep] asked you
a question.

38
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,824
I'm 4.

39
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:04,023
4 years old, eh?

40
00:08:04,703 --> 00:08:08,903
You know,
I had a little girl once.

41
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,063
She'd be about 4 now.

42
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:18,622
Now, baby, me and mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

43
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:19,942
to talk about.

44
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:20,982
You can go in your room.

45
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:23,862
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

46
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,302
Okay?

47
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:28,662
Nikki!

48
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:31,461
In your room.
Now.

49
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,660
You want some coffee?

50
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,860
Yeah. Sure.

51
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,180
This Pasadena homemaker's name

52
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,340
Is Jeanne Bell.

53
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,939
Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.

54
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,619
But back when we were
acquainted, four years ago,

55
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,739
her name was Vernita Green.

56
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,219
Her code name was Copperhead.

57
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,059
Mine, Black Mamba.

58
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,579
Do you have a towel?

59
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:13,378
Yeah.

60
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:17,658
Thanks.

61
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,698
You still take cream and sugar?

62
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:20,658
Yeah.

63
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:26,297
So suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

64
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:28,617
You suppose correctly.

65
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:30,817
Look, bitch, I need to know

66
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,497
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

67
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:35,497
You can relax for now.

68
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:40,096
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

69
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:42,696
That's being more rational

70
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,016
than Bill let me to believe
you were capable of.

71
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:49,336
It's mercy, compassion,
and forgiveness I lack.

72
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:51,255
Not rationality.

73
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:57,095
Look.

74
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:00,455
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

75
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,935
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

76
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,814
You have every right
to want to get even.

77
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:08,294
No, no, no, no, no.

78
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:09,374
No.

79
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:13,094
To get even, even Stephen,

80
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:19,333
would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

81
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:24,053
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

82
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:26,333
That would be even, Vernita.

83
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:28,453
That'd be about square.

84
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,413
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

85
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:33,132
But I can't.

86
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:37,172
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

87
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:41,012
Oh, great.
I don't care.

88
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,852
Be that as it may,

89
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:45,811
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

90
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:50,411
However, beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

91
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:54,051
Bitch, you can stop right there.

92
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:56,531
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

93
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:57,891
before the eyes of your daughter

94
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,490
does not mean that parading her
around in front of me

95
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,450
is gonna inspire sympathy.

96
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,330
You and I have
unfinished business.

97
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,530
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

98
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,970
in the subsequent four years,

99
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,089
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

100
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,449
So when do we do this?

101
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,569
It all depends.

102
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,169
When do you want to die?

103
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,009
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

104
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,288
How about tonight, bitch?

105
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:28,568
Splendid.
Where?

106
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,768
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach our little league

107
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,688
about a mile from here.

108
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,728
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

109
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:38,648
dressed all in black,
your hair in a back stocking.

110
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:41,407
And we have us a knife fight.

111
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:43,447
We won't be bothered.

112
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:48,247
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

113
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:58,686
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

114
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:00,126
with an edged weapon.

115
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:02,246
Fuck you, bitch.

116
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:04,646
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

117
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:08,285
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

118
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,165
Black Mamba.

119
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,845
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

120
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:14,805
Weapon of choice?

121
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:17,485
If you want to stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

122
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,604
Very funny, bitch.

123
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:23,324
Very funny!

124
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

125
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,560
For that, I'm sorry.

126
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,039
But you can take my word for it.

127
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,399
Your mother had it coming.

128
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:54,717
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

129
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:00,077
I'll be waiting.

130
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:06,517
For those regarded as warriors...

131
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,116
When engaged in combat...

132
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:14,076
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

133
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:21,395
Suppress a human emotion and compassion...

134
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:32,515
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

135
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:43,994
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

136
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:09,992
Come on out to Dallas.

137
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:13,552
This is Rockabilly Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

138
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:15,831
And next, we got some record.

139
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,551
Very own wildman,
Charlie Feathers.

140
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:57,468
Well, give me the gory detais,
Son Number One.

141
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:59,868
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

142
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:04,868
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

143
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:08,307
Give me a figure.

144
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:10,307
Nine dead bodies.

145
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,907
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

146
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,787
Bride. Groom.

147
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:17,427
Reverend.

148
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:20,107
Reverend's wife.

149
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:24,026
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

150
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,226
It would appear
somebody objected to this

151
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:28,546
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

152
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:36,705
Good gravy, Marie.

153
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:43,425
What'd I tell you, Pop?

154
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:46,585
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

155
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:49,264
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

156
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:50,784
You're in a house of worship.

157
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:52,224
Sorry, Pop.

158
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,824
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

159
00:16:56,944 --> 00:17:01,623
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

160
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:04,103
Four, maybe five strong.

161
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,143
How can you tell?

162
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,103
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

163
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,863
This ain't no
squirrey amateur.

164
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:16,302
This is the work of a salty dog.

165
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,982
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

166
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:22,142
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

167
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:25,422
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

168
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:29,261
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

169
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,660
Who's the bride?

170
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,100
I don't know.

171
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,660
The name
on the marriage certificate

172
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,700
is Arlene Machiaveli.

173
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,540
That's a fake.

174
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,180
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

175
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,700
on account of the dress.

176
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,379
You can tell she was pregnant.

177
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,019
Man would have to be a mad dog

178
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:01,859
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

179
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,299
Look at her.

180
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:12,298
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

181
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,978
She's a little
blood-splattered angel.

182
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:20,058
Son Number One?

183
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:21,418
Yeah?

184
00:18:21,418 --> 00:18:25,817
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

185
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:57,046
I might never have liked you.

186
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:01,086
Point in fact, I despise you.

187
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:06,445
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

188
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:12,405
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

189
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:15,645
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

190
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:19,284
My gift to you.

191
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:26,964
For fucks sake.

192
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:31,563
Hello, Bill.

193
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:35,123
What's her condition?

194
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,323
Comatose.

195
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:39,523
Where is she?

196
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:42,683
I'm standing over her right now.

197
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,802
That's my girl.

198
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:50,002
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

199
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:51,122
What?

200
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:52,682
We owe her better than that.

201
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,482
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

202
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:56,122
Will you keep your voice down?

203
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:58,041
You don't owe her shit!

204
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,041
May I say one thing?

205
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:01,881
Speak.

206
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,841
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

207
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:06,761
But you didn't kill her.

208
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:08,601
And I put a bullet in her head.

209
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:11,840
But her heart
just kept on beating.

210
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,280
Now, you saw that yourself

211
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,080
with your own beautiful
blue eyes, did you not?

212
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,400
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

213
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,679
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

214
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,679
But one thing we won't do

215
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,919
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

216
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,758
and kill her in her sleep.

217
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:40,318
And the reason
we won't do that thing

218
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:45,398
is because that thing
would lower us.

219
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:47,438
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

220
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:50,598
Guess.

221
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:52,997
Do you really have to guess?

222
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:54,997
No.

223
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:58,837
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

224
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,277
Come on home, honey.

225
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,476
Affirmative.

226
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:08,796
I love you very much.

227
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:10,916
I love you, too.

228
00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:15,036
Bye-bye.

229
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,275
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

230
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:29,835
Hmm?

231
00:23:31,354 --> 00:23:34,314
Word of advice, shithead.

232
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:37,314
Don't you ever wake up.

233
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:17,191
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

234
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:20,151
Bill, it's your baby.

235
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:22,866
Oh, my baby.

236
00:25:47,424 --> 00:25:49,744
Four years.

237
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,264
Four years.

238
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,142
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

239
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:23,662
You getting your freak on
or what?

240
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:25,782
Oh, yeah, boy.

241
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,821
20, 40, 60, 75.

242
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:33,741
Yeah.
Now, here's the rules.

243
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,381
Rule number one.

244
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,541
No punching her.

245
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,261
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

246
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:39,980
or less some teeth, jig's up.

247
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,460
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

248
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,180
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

249
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,660
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

250
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,620
- Now, are we clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

251
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,779
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

252
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:56,459
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

253
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:59,539
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

254
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:01,659
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

255
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:03,179
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

256
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:04,739
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

257
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:06,339
I'll Be back in 20.

258
00:27:07,578 --> 00:27:09,138
Yeah.

259
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:11,058
Oh, shit.

260
00:27:11,138 --> 00:27:13,538
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

261
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:16,018
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

262
00:27:16,138 --> 00:27:19,378
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

263
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:22,377
Bon appetit, good buddy.

264
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:34,336
Oh, yeah.

265
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:36,656
Oh, God damn.

266
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:40,216
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

267
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,294
Oh.

268
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,612
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

269
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:30,452
Coming in, ready or not.

270
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:33,052
Hey, buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

271
00:28:34,292 --> 00:28:35,732
Whoa.

272
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:54,890
Aaaah!

273
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,730
Where's Bill?

274
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,329
Where's Bill?

275
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:10,729
Please stop hitting me.

276
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:11,889
Where's Bill?

277
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:14,849
I don't know who Bill is!

278
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:16,369
Bullshit!

279
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:27,528
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

280
00:29:27,608 --> 00:29:30,768
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

281
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:32,488
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

282
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:36,727
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

283
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:42,167
Your name is Buck.

284
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:44,007
Right?

285
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:47,087
And you came here to fuck.

286
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,206
Right?

287
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:49,846
Wait aminute.
Wait.

288
00:30:14,684 --> 00:30:16,604
"Pussy Wagon."

289
00:30:16,724 --> 00:30:18,524
You fucker.

290
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:47,482
Texas. Okay.

291
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:31,354
Wiggle your big toe.

292
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:37,754
Wiggle your big toe.

293
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:47,833
Wiggle your big toe.

294
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:55,313
Wiggle your big toe.

295
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:01,552
Wiggle your big toe.

296
00:33:01,552 --> 00:33:03,872
As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,

297
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:06,352
trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...

298
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:07,992
Wiggle your big toe.

299
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:11,991
...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.

300
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:14,871
And the dicks responsible.

301
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:21,711
Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.

302
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,150
When fortune smiles
on something

303
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,550
as violent and ugly as revenge,

304
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,470
It seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,

305
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,470
you're doing his will.

306
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,990
At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,

307
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,989
the first name
on my death list,

308
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:41,829
O-Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.

309
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:44,229
But when one
manages the difficult task

310
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:46,909
of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,

311
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:50,068
one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?

312
00:34:02,628 --> 00:34:06,107
O-Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base

313
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:08,387
In Tokyo, Japan.

314
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:11,827
The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American Army brat

315
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:15,307
made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.

316
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,106
It was at that age
she witnessed

317
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:18,946
the death of her parents
at the hands

318
00:34:19,026 --> 00:34:24,586
of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.

319
00:34:50,384 --> 00:34:51,824
Hyah!

320
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:30,101
Hmm.

321
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,616
Hmm.

322
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,893
Oh.

323
00:37:31,772 --> 00:37:32,932
Mommy.

324
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:42,087
She swore revenge.

325
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:47,086
Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.

326
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:52,926
At 11, she got her revenge.

327
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:59,245
Look at me, Matsumoto...

328
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:03,845
...take a good look at my face.

329
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,685
Look at my eyes.

330
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:12,684
Look at my mouth.

331
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:15,564
Do I look familiar?

332
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:19,764
Do I look like somebody...

333
00:39:19,884 --> 00:39:21,884
you murdered?!

334
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,478
By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.

335
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:24,635
At 25, she did her part
in the killing

336
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:29,634
of nine innocent people,
Including my unborn daughter,

337
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:33,834
In a small wedding chapel
In El Paso, Texas.

338
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:41,313
But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.

339
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:43,793
She should have killed 10.

340
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:48,713
However, before satisfactlon
would be mine,

341
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:50,713
first things first.

342
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:53,593
Wiggle your big toe.

343
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:02,512
Hard part's over.

344
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:06,152
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

345
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,349
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

346
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:43,549
Okinawa.
One-way.

347
00:43:09,627 --> 00:43:10,867
Hi.

348
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:12,787
Welcome...

349
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,146
Welcome.

350
00:43:19,986 --> 00:43:21,826
You English?

351
00:43:21,906 --> 00:43:24,106
Almost.
American.

352
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:27,745
American.
Welcome, American.

353
00:43:27,865 --> 00:43:29,105
Domo.

354
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:31,865
My English very good.

355
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:35,065
You said "domo."
Can you speak Japanese?

356
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,025
No, no.

357
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:38,865
Just a few words learned
since yesterday.

358
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:41,464
Um, may I sit at the bar?

359
00:43:41,464 --> 00:43:44,744
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please sit.

360
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:47,624
Oh.

361
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:50,504
What other words did you learn?

362
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:52,504
Oh, just a minute.

363
00:43:52,584 --> 00:43:56,703
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

364
00:43:57,023 --> 00:43:59,783
I'm watching my soap operas.

365
00:44:00,943 --> 00:44:02,863
Lazy bastard...

366
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,143
Screw your soap opera... hurry up!

367
00:44:05,263 --> 00:44:06,903
The tea's hot.

368
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:08,622
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

369
00:44:08,622 --> 00:44:09,942
Shut up!

370
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:12,822
Get your ass out here!

371
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,742
Uh, excuse me.

372
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:20,022
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

373
00:44:20,102 --> 00:44:20,982
Oh, let's see.

374
00:44:21,062 --> 00:44:23,101
Um, "arigato."

375
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:25,581
"Arigato."
Good!

376
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:29,621
Um, already said "domo,"
right?

377
00:44:29,621 --> 00:44:32,021
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:33,061
"Konn-itch-iwa."

379
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:34,781
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

380
00:44:34,901 --> 00:44:36,500
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

381
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,260
Konnichi wa.
Pease repeat.

382
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,380
Konnichi wa.

383
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,460
Perfect.

384
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,460
Good, good, good.

385
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,940
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

386
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,500
Oh, you're making fun of me!

387
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,379
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

388
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:52,419
Pronounciation very good.

389
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:56,939
You say arigato
like we say arigato.

390
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:02,978
Well, thank you.
I mean, arigato.

391
00:45:02,978 --> 00:45:04,338
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:06,818
You should learn Japanese.

393
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:08,738
Very easy.

394
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:10,738
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

395
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:12,858
Most difficult.

396
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:15,737
But you have Japanese tongue.

397
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:19,497
Okay, okay.

398
00:45:21,977 --> 00:45:26,097
Oh.
Oh, my God.

399
00:45:26,177 --> 00:45:31,736
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea?
Hurry up... goddammit!

400
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:39,536
Lazy oaf...

401
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:45,855
What do you want?

402
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:47,775
Beg your pardon?

403
00:45:47,775 --> 00:45:50,935
Uh, drink.

404
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,175
Oh, yes.

405
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:54,655
A bottle of warm sake, please.

406
00:45:54,655 --> 00:45:56,214
Warm sake?

407
00:45:56,294 --> 00:45:58,334
Very good!

408
00:45:58,414 --> 00:45:59,774
One warm sake!

409
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:02,934
Sake? In the middle of the day?

410
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:07,414
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn. Get the sake!

411
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:10,293
How come I always have to get the sake?

412
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:11,453
You listen we...

413
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:15,093
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

414
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:16,813
If this were the military,

415
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:20,453
I'd be General by now.

416
00:46:20,573 --> 00:46:23,252
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

417
00:46:23,252 --> 00:46:27,092
If you were General, I'd be emperor,

418
00:46:27,092 --> 00:46:29,492
and you'd still get the sake -

419
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:31,612
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

420
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:32,652
Do you understand?

421
00:46:32,732 --> 00:46:34,652
I'm not bad, okay? I shaved my head.

422
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:36,571
Do you understand me?

423
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,291
Sorry.

424
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:46,371
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

425
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:47,811
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

426
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:50,850
What brings you to Okinawa?

427
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,690
Came to see a man.

428
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,370
Oh, yeah.

429
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,050
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

430
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,690
Not quite.

431
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,530
Not friend?

432
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,969
Never met him.

433
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:04,889
Never?

434
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:06,689
Who is he?

435
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:08,329
May I ask?

436
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:12,049
Hattori Hanzo.

437
00:47:23,488 --> 00:47:26,168
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

438
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:30,007
I need Japanese steel.

439
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:34,967
Why do you need Japanese steel?

440
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,287
I have vermin to kill.

441
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:48,126
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

442
00:47:50,406 --> 00:47:52,326
Huge.

443
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,439
May I?

444
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,199
You may.

445
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,399
Wait.

446
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,879
Try the second one down.

447
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:19,635
Funny.

448
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:21,955
You like samurai swords.

449
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:27,194
I like baseball.

450
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:37,274
I wanted to show you these.

451
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:39,313
However...

452
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:43,513
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

453
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:48,873
...I no longer make instruments of death.

454
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,672
What I have here...

455
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:57,992
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

456
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:02,872
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

457
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:10,951
...I have retired.

458
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,630
Then give me one of these.

459
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,030
These are not for sale.

460
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,670
I didn't say "sell me."

461
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,310
I said "give me."

462
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:33,469
Why should I help you?

463
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:38,549
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

464
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:44,029
And considering the student,

465
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:49,028
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

466
00:52:43,184 --> 00:52:44,824
You can sleep here.

467
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,784
It will take me a month...

468
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:51,744
...to make the sword.

469
00:52:53,063 --> 00:52:55,743
I suggest you spend it practicing.

470
00:54:20,537 --> 00:54:22,337
I've completed doing...

471
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:27,816
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

472
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:33,576
...to never do again.

473
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:39,896
I have created "something that kills people."

474
00:54:41,535 --> 00:54:47,095
And in that purpose, was a success.

475
00:54:50,055 --> 00:54:51,975
I've done this because philosophically,

476
00:54:52,735 --> 00:54:58,494
I am sympathetic to your aim.

477
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:06,853
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

478
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,253
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

479
00:55:11,373 --> 00:55:14,413
...God will be cut.

480
00:55:26,412 --> 00:55:28,612
Yellow-haired warrior...

481
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,932
Go.

482
00:55:31,012 --> 00:55:32,532
Domo.

483
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:56,810
It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas,

484
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,730
that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny

485
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,849
financially
and philosophically in her

486
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:03,129
Shakespearean-in-magnitude
power struggle

487
00:56:03,249 --> 00:56:04,569
with the other yakuza clans

488
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:08,809
over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.

489
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:10,809
When the final sword
was sheathed,

490
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:13,889
It was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse...

491
00:56:15,048 --> 00:56:18,688
...the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.

492
00:56:20,688 --> 00:56:22,608
The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,

493
00:56:22,608 --> 00:56:25,208
who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"

494
00:56:25,288 --> 00:56:29,047
is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.

495
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:33,167
The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.

496
00:56:33,247 --> 00:56:36,327
Another former protegee
of Bill's.

497
00:56:38,607 --> 00:56:40,727
The young girl
in the school-girl uniform

498
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:46,086
is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.

499
00:56:46,206 --> 00:56:49,246
Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,

500
00:56:49,366 --> 00:56:51,966
she makes up for in madness.

501
00:56:52,046 --> 00:56:53,686
Do you like Ferraris?

502
00:56:57,525 --> 00:56:59,445
Ferrari... italian trash.

503
00:57:08,844 --> 00:57:10,084
Do you want to screw me?

504
00:57:11,724 --> 00:57:15,044
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

505
00:57:16,484 --> 00:57:17,364
Yes.

506
00:57:21,403 --> 00:57:22,643
How 'bout now, big boy?

507
00:57:23,803 --> 00:57:26,283
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

508
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:29,643
...or is it I...

509
00:57:29,643 --> 00:57:31,843
...or is it I... who has penetrated you?

510
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,802
See what I mean?

511
00:57:36,242 --> 00:57:40,562
The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,

512
00:57:40,682 --> 00:57:44,882
the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.

513
00:57:46,722 --> 00:57:48,921
And just in case
you were wondering

514
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:52,761
how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American

515
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:57,441
become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan,

516
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,001
I'll tell you.

517
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:01,680
The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality

518
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,360
came up before the council
only once.

519
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:09,320
The nlght O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.

520
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,360
The man who seems bound
and determined

521
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,240
to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.

522
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,599
And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...

523
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:22,279
Boss Tanaka!

524
00:58:22,879 --> 00:58:23,999
What's the meaning of this outburst?

525
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:25,839
This is a time for celebration!

526
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,998
And what exactly are we celebrating?

527
00:58:30,518 --> 00:58:32,758
The perversion of our illustrious council?

528
00:58:34,638 --> 00:58:37,518
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

529
00:58:37,638 --> 00:58:38,878
I will not tolerate this!

530
00:58:38,878 --> 00:58:40,998
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

531
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:47,237
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

532
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:54,237
My father...

533
00:58:54,877 --> 00:58:55,836
...along with yours,

534
00:58:55,956 --> 00:58:57,396
and along with yours,
started this council.

535
00:58:58,516 --> 00:58:59,876
And while...

536
00:58:59,956 --> 00:59:01,396
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

537
00:59:01,516 --> 00:59:03,036
...they weep in the afterlife...

538
00:59:03,716 --> 00:59:04,596
- Shut up!

539
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:07,276
...over the perversion committed today!

540
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:10,435
Outrageous!

541
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:13,115
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

542
00:59:13,195 --> 00:59:14,155
Bastard!

543
00:59:15,235 --> 00:59:16,275
Fuck face!

544
00:59:16,755 --> 00:59:18,395
Gentlemen.

545
00:59:20,395 --> 00:59:25,754
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

546
00:59:27,194 --> 00:59:31,034
By all means, allow him to express it.

547
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:36,513
Speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

548
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,273
...which I love...

549
00:59:40,153 --> 00:59:41,513
...more than my own chidren,

550
00:59:42,553 --> 00:59:47,153
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

551
00:59:53,872 --> 00:59:56,152
Aah! Aah!

552
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:13,151
So that you understand how serious I am...

553
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:15,351
...I'm going to say this in English.

554
01:00:15,431 --> 01:00:16,310
Huh!

555
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,869
- As your leader...

556
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:32,429
I encourage you
from time to time,

557
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:36,909
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

558
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:37,869
If you're unconvinced

559
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:40,269
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

560
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:41,509
tell me so.

561
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:43,068
But allow me to convince you.

562
01:00:43,148 --> 01:00:45,188
And promise you,
right here and now,

563
01:00:45,268 --> 01:00:48,628
no subject will ever be taboo.

564
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:51,868
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

565
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:55,908
The price you pay

566
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:58,787
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

567
01:00:58,787 --> 01:01:02,627
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

568
01:01:02,707 --> 01:01:05,027
Just like this fucker here.

569
01:01:07,227 --> 01:01:09,707
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

570
01:01:09,826 --> 01:01:14,306
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

571
01:01:16,346 --> 01:01:17,866
Didn't think so.

572
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:23,825
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

573
01:01:23,905 --> 01:01:26,305
One ticket to Tokyo pease.

574
01:03:54,654 --> 01:03:55,894
Moshi moshi.

575
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:12,164
Gogo.

576
01:08:20,794 --> 01:08:23,674
You have to say "Yes, yes, yes" to
any selfish demands they make.

577
01:08:23,754 --> 01:08:25,394
They demand ridiculous things.

578
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:27,594
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

579
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:28,434
What's gonna happen?

580
01:08:28,634 --> 01:08:29,994
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

581
01:08:30,074 --> 01:08:31,794
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

582
01:08:31,914 --> 01:08:32,674
No, I don't want that.

583
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:19,950
Yes, it's me.

584
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:27,229
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

585
01:09:42,188 --> 01:09:44,588
Who do you remind me of?

586
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,268
Charlie Brown!

587
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:51,028
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

588
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:51,988
Charlie Brown.

589
01:09:52,268 --> 01:09:53,708
Four pepperoni pizzas.

590
01:09:54,068 --> 01:09:55,227
That's not on our menu...

591
01:09:55,427 --> 01:09:57,547
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

592
01:09:58,787 --> 01:10:01,267
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

593
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:04,627
O-Ren Ishii!

594
01:10:05,787 --> 01:10:09,146
You and I have unfinished business!

595
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,980
Charlie Brown, beat it.

596
01:11:44,459 --> 01:11:45,139
Miki.

597
01:12:03,258 --> 01:12:04,618
Tear the bitch apart!

598
01:13:31,371 --> 01:13:36,651
So, O-Ren, anymore subordinates
for me to kill?

599
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:39,531
Hi!

600
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:42,051
Gogo, right?

601
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:45,370
Bingo.

602
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:47,210
And you're Black Mamba.

603
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:52,090
Our reputations precede us.

604
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:54,690
Don't they?

605
01:13:56,329 --> 01:14:01,409
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

606
01:14:02,449 --> 01:14:04,969
But I beg you.

607
01:14:05,049 --> 01:14:06,569
Walk away.

608
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:15,008
You call that begging?

609
01:14:21,168 --> 01:14:23,567
You can beg better than that.

610
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:19,479
Aah!

611
01:16:25,238 --> 01:16:25,838
Aah!

612
01:16:28,038 --> 01:16:28,798
Aah!

613
01:17:29,594 --> 01:17:31,114
Is that what I think it is?

614
01:17:31,233 --> 01:17:33,833
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

615
01:17:34,473 --> 01:17:40,913
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

616
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:43,593
Silly rabbit.

617
01:17:44,153 --> 01:17:45,032
Trix are for...

618
01:17:45,032 --> 01:17:46,072
Kids.

619
01:17:49,912 --> 01:17:51,352
Hyaaaaaaah!

620
01:18:58,307 --> 01:18:59,267
Hyah!

621
01:19:12,026 --> 01:19:14,106
Aaaaaaaaahh!

622
01:19:31,585 --> 01:19:32,624
Aaahh!

623
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,340
Aaaaahhh!

624
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:50,734
Aaah!

625
01:23:58,925 --> 01:24:03,444
This is what you get
for fucking around with yakuzas!

626
01:24:03,524 --> 01:24:05,284
Go home to your mother!

627
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,520
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

628
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,840
...take them with you!

629
01:25:08,839 --> 01:25:09,999
However...

630
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:15,079
...leave the limbs you've lost.

631
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:19,479
They belong to me now.

632
01:25:23,798 --> 01:25:26,478
Except you, Sofie!

633
01:25:27,158 --> 01:25:30,318
You stay right where you are.

634
01:26:21,554 --> 01:26:23,914
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

635
01:26:28,434 --> 01:26:29,993
Where was it made?

636
01:26:31,713 --> 01:26:33,233
Okinawa.

637
01:26:35,073 --> 01:26:37,833
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

638
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,913
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

639
01:26:40,913 --> 01:26:42,153
You lie!

640
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,632
Mmm-hmm.

641
01:26:54,512 --> 01:26:56,711
Swords however, never get tired.

642
01:26:58,071 --> 01:27:01,351
Hope you've saved your energy.

643
01:27:04,871 --> 01:27:06,031
If you haven't...

644
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:10,070
...you might not last five minutes.

645
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,070
But as last looks go,

646
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:17,750
you could do worse.

647
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:53,578
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

648
01:29:55,858 --> 01:29:58,658
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

649
01:30:01,538 --> 01:30:04,577
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

650
01:30:33,735 --> 01:30:35,095
Attack me...

651
01:30:36,335 --> 01:30:37,855
...with everything you have.

652
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:33,571
For ridiculing you earlier...

653
01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:37,811
...I apologize.

654
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:47,210
Accepted.

655
01:32:03,129 --> 01:32:03,969
Ready?

656
01:32:08,888 --> 01:32:10,008
Come on.

657
01:32:41,846 --> 01:32:50,405
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

658
01:34:51,316 --> 01:34:52,756
Sofie.

659
01:34:53,436 --> 01:34:55,236
Sofie.

660
01:34:55,236 --> 01:34:57,076
My Sofie.

661
01:34:57,156 --> 01:34:59,196
I'm so sorry.

662
01:35:02,435 --> 01:35:05,795
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

663
01:35:05,915 --> 01:35:07,715
No more of that.

664
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:09,435
But still...

665
01:35:09,555 --> 01:35:12,035
But still nothing.

666
01:35:13,554 --> 01:35:16,634
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

667
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:19,994
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

668
01:35:20,754 --> 01:35:23,434
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

669
01:35:23,554 --> 01:35:26,514
The first reason is information.

670
01:35:26,514 --> 01:35:29,313
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

671
01:35:29,313 --> 01:35:31,873
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

672
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:36,313
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

673
01:35:36,313 --> 01:35:40,232
And every time
you don't give me answers,

674
01:35:40,312 --> 01:35:42,832
I'm gonna cut something off.

675
01:35:43,472 --> 01:35:49,152
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

676
01:35:49,712 --> 01:35:51,432
- Give me your other arm!

677
01:35:54,431 --> 01:35:58,911
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

678
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:00,071
If you had to guess...

679
01:36:00,191 --> 01:36:01,031
What they've been doing.

680
01:36:01,151 --> 01:36:02,271
Why she left you alive...

681
01:36:02,391 --> 01:36:04,191
And where I can find them.

682
01:36:04,311 --> 01:36:06,111
What would be your guess?

683
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:10,830
Guessing won't be necessary.

684
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:12,630
She informed me.

685
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:18,670
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

686
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:20,789
As I said before,

687
01:36:20,909 --> 01:36:25,309
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

688
01:36:25,389 --> 01:36:30,589
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

689
01:36:30,669 --> 01:36:34,228
everything that happened
here tonight.

690
01:36:34,308 --> 01:36:37,468
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

691
01:36:37,588 --> 01:36:41,028
by witnessing
your deformed body.

692
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:45,148
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

693
01:36:45,268 --> 01:36:48,107
I want him to know what I know.

694
01:36:48,227 --> 01:36:51,787
I want him to know
I want him to know.

695
01:36:52,267 --> 01:36:54,547
And I want them all to know

696
01:36:54,627 --> 01:37:00,387
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

697
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:27,904
Revenge is never a straight line.

698
01:37:30,984 --> 01:37:32,624
It's a forest.

699
01:37:33,864 --> 01:37:36,664
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

700
01:37:37,784 --> 01:37:40,664
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

701
01:37:44,023 --> 01:37:48,143
That woman deserves her revenge.

702
01:37:52,863 --> 01:37:56,982
And we deserve to die.

703
01:38:00,222 --> 01:38:03,982
She must suffer
to her last breath.

704
01:38:16,261 --> 01:38:19,141
How did you find me?

705
01:38:19,141 --> 01:38:20,781
I'm the man.

706
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:28,060
One more thing, Sofie.

707
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:32,060
Is she aware her daughter
is still aive?
