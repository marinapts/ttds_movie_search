landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre.

At the same moment,
on a restaurant terrace nearby,

5
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:16,325
the wind magically made two glasses
dance unseen on a tablecloth.

Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat,
28 Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9,

00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:28,045
returning from his best friend's funeral,

belonging to Raphal Poulain,

made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine.

Nine months later,

00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:49,899
Amlie Poulain was born.

works at a spa in Enghien-Les-Bains.

Raphal Poulain dislikes:

19
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:48,892
Peeing next to someone else. He also dislikes:

20
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,645
Catching scornful glances at his sandals.

21
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:58,274
Clingy wet swimming trunks.

Raphal Poulain likes:

00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:05,280
Peeling off large strips of wallpaper.

24
00:04:08,293 --> 00:04:10,867
Lining up all his shoes and polishing them.

25
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:14,128
Emptying his tool box,

26
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:17,044
cleaning it out,

27
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:20,130
and putting everything back.

Amlie's mother, Amandine,
a schoolmistress from Gueugnon,

00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,427

When someone she doesn't like

33
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,737
brushes against her hand.

34

Amlie is six.

41
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,305
Like all little girls,
she'd like to be hugged by her daddy.

42
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:11,397
But he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.

43
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,145
The thrill of this rare contact

44
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:16,481
makes her heart beat like a drum.

45
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,070

Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.

66
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,608
Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.

67
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,276
A decision is made.

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,695
Enough!

69
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:19,397
To comfort Amlie, her mother
gives her a second-hand Instamatic camera.

70
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:33,659
Little girl! Look what you did!

71
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:38,867
A neighbour fools her into thinking
her camera causes accidents.

72
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,582
Because she'd been taking pictures
all afternoon, Amlie is petrified.

73
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:47,636
She stares at the TV, racked by the guilt

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,803
of causing a huge fire,

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,758
two derailments

One day tragedy strikes.

82
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,698
Amandine takes Amlie to Notre Dame
to light a candle and pray for a baby brother.

83
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,112
Three minutes later, heaven sends,

84
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:56,320
alas, not a baby boy, but Marguerite,
a tourist from Quebec,

85
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:58,449
bent on ending her life.

86
00:09:01,086 --> 00:09:02,995
Amandine Poulain is killed instantly.

87
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:11,300
After her mother's death,
Amlie lives alone with her father.

88
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:15,391
His unsociable tendencies increase.

89
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,886
He's obsessed with building a miniature shrine

90
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:21,144
to house his wife's ashes.

91
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,775
Days, months and years go by.

92
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,737
In such a dead world,

93
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:40,454
Amlie prefers to dream
until she's old enough to leave home.

94
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,136
Five years later,
she's a waitress in Montmartre

95
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:56,339
at The Two Windmills.

96
00:09:57,642 --> 00:09:59,302
It is August 29th.

97
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:03,054
In 48 hours, her life will change for ever.

98
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:07,729
But she doesn't know it yet.

99
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:12,440
She lives quietly among her colleagues
and the caf's regulars.

100
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:14,982
That's Suzanne, the owner.

101
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:17,870
She limps a little but she's never spilt a drink.

102
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:21,032
When she was younger, she was a circus rider.

103
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:23,657
She likes athletes who cry with disappointment.

104
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:28,705
She dislikes seeing men humiliated
in front of their kids in her caf.

105
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:32,707
Georgette is the tobacconist.
She's a hypochondriac.

106
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:37,470
Migraines one day, sciatica the next.
She hates the words

107
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:39,722
"fruit of thy womb".

108
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:43,931
Gina works with Amlie.
Her grandmother was a healer.

109
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,982
She likes cracking bones.

110
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:50,442
She's bringing a kir to Hipolito, a failed writer.

111
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:54,022
He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.

112
00:10:56,035 --> 00:11:00,577
Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.

113
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:03,196
He's always jealously spying on her.

114
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,993
All he likes

115
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:07,998
is popping bubble wrap.

116
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,503
And here's Philomne, an air hostess.

117
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,547
Amlie looks after her cat Rodrigue
when she's away. Philomne likes

118
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:17,512
the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles.

119
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:21,506
Rodrigue likes overhearing children's stories.

120
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:25,349
No, thanks, ma'am. I never work on Sundays.

121
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:31,108
At weekends, Amlie often takes a train
from the Gare du Nord to see her father.

122
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:35,103
- Why don't you use your retirement to...?
- To do what?

123
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:37,233
Travel. You've never been away.

124
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,825
When we were young,
your mother and I longed to travel.

125
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,367
But we couldn't.

126
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:49,419
- Because of your heart.
- Yes. I know.

127
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,835
So now...

128
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:53,709
Now...

129
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,595
Some Friday evenings,
Amlie goes to the cinema.

130
00:11:56,637 --> 00:12:00,302
I like turning round
and looking at people's faces in the dark.

131
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:10,681
I like noticing details
that no-one else ever sees.

132
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:17,317
But I hate it in old American movies
when drivers don't watch the road.

133
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:25,160
Amlie doesn't have a boyfriend.

134
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:29,584
She tried once or twice,
but the results were a let-down.

135
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:33,460
Instead, she cultivates a taste
for small pleasures.

136
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,999
Plunging her hand deep into a sack of grain.

137
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:39,805
Cracking crme brle

138
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:41,887
with a teaspoon.

139
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:48,481
And skimming stones on the Canal St Martin.

140
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:32,356
They call him the Glass Man.

141
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,151
He was born with bones as brittle as crystal.

142
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,650
All his furniture is padded.

143
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:42,031
A handshake would be enough
to crush his fingers.

144
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:44,234
He's stayed indoors for 20 years.

145
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,450
Time has changed nothing.

146
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:52,826
Amlie still takes refuge in solitude.

147
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:57,540
She amuses herself with silly questions
about the world below,

148
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:01,589
such as: "How many couples
are having an orgasm now?"

149
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:13,019
Fifteen.

150
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:18,987
Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997.

151
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:23,691
comes the event
that will change her life for ever.

152
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:28,369
Lady Di, Princess of Wales,
died in a car crash in Paris last night

153
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:32,329
with her companion Dodi Al Fayed...

154
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:26,878
Only the first man
to discover Tutankhamen's tomb

155
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:29,007
would understand how she felt

156
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,300
on finding this treasure

157
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:35,183
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.

158
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:43,268
On August 31st at 4am,

159
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:46,359
Amlie has a dazzling idea.

160
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:49,943
Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner

161
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:52,321
and give him back his treasure.

162
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:57,118
If he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder.

163
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:59,162
If not, too bad.

164
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:09,927
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don't see much of you.

165
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:14,268
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the '50s?

166
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:16,553
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

167
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:21,150
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

168
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:25,322
Boys? I've known so many.

169
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:29,658
They're cute until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

170
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,778
I've known so many boys.

171
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:35,364
- When did you come here?
- In '64.

172
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,168
You'll have heard the story.

173
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,417
No, I don't think so.

174
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:42,289
I'm amazed. Sit down.

175
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:47,009
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

176
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:50,504
It's no secret that he slept with his secretary.

177
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:54,513
They used every hotel around.

178
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,268
Not the grotty ones, either.

179
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:59,645
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

180
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,184
but only on satin.

181
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:04,234
So my husband swiped from the till.

182
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:07,315
A little at first, then 50 million.

183
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:10,651
Off they flew to South America.

184
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:13,943
Drink up.

185
00:17:15,998 --> 00:17:19,035
On January 20th 1970,

186
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:21,492
my doorbell rang.

187
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:26,622
"Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America."

188
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:29,795
My life stopped there.

189
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:33,013
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

190
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:35,892
Poor creature.

191
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:40,513
See how lovingly

192
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,604
he still stares at his master?

193
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:44,682
One day

194
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:46,229
I'll read you his letters.

195
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:48,022
No, don't go!

196
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:50,527
You can spare five minutes.

197
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:52,235
He wrote this

198
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:53,945
from the barracks.

199
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,033
"Darling Mado." That's me.

200
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,742
I'm called Madeleine.

201
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:02,793
"I can't sleep, can't eat,

202
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:07,629
knowing that my only reason to live
is far away in Paris.

203
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:10,082
I won't see her until a fortnight on Friday,

204
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:15,925
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station

205
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:19,060
in her strappy blue dress."

206
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:23,148
In brackets: "The one you think
is too transparent."

207
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:34,024
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

208
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:38,157
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

209
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,779
My name's Madeleine Wells.

210
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:43,918
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

211
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:47,461
She wept, right? And Wells as in water.

212
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:51,718
Talk about being born to cry!

213
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:57,132
About your question...

214
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:02,640
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

215
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,097
Hello, Amlie-mellow!

216
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,688
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

217
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:11,523
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

218
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:15,570
- What was their name?
- You've got me there, dear.

219
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:19,567
In 1950, I was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

220
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:21,246
The "cretin" is Lucien.

221
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,335
He's no genius, but Amlie likes him.
She likes the way

222
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:28,712
he handles each endive like a precious object

223
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:31,959
to be treated with care.
It's his way of showing

224
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,420
his love of good work.

225
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:34,500
Look at him!

226
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:39,014
Like he's nursing a baby bird
that's fallen out of its nest!

227
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,727
Don't ask him for currants!

228
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,393
You'd be here till Monday!

229
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,598
Get moving, spastic!

230
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,689
She hasn't got all day.

231
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,735
Here.

232
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:57,482
Go and see my mother.
She has the memory of an elephant.

233
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:59,693
Elephant Mum!

234
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:02,491
Thank you.

235
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:22,220
Bredoteau.

236
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:24,842
Sorry?

237
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:26,687
It's the name you're after.

238
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:31,144
But if it's me that says so,
it won't count. I'm senile.

239
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:33,151
Ignore him. He's senile.

240
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:36,273
See what he's done to my laurel?

241
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:43,081
His old job was punching mtro tickets.

242
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:48,329
For three months now,
he's got up every night to punch holes

243
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:51,877
- in my laurels!
- I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life!

244
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:56,384
- We all need a way to relax.
- I skim stones.

245
00:20:56,428 --> 00:21:00,591
- You do?
- I'll find it. Don't worry.

246
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,594
- I file everything.
- Like what?

247
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:08,435
Your son's nearly 50
and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

248
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:13,189
You were still squeezing his toothpaste at 15,
so it follows.

249
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:15,608
Right. Camus...

250
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:19,653
2nd floor on the right. Brossard...
Brossard was on staircase B.

251
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:21,278
Got it!

252
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,450
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

253
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:26,248
They were from the Pas de Calais.

254
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,912
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

255
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:37,357
Groping under the photo booth
is Nino Quincampoix.

256
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:46,487
When Amlie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.

257
00:22:57,632 --> 00:23:02,709
Five miles apart, one dreamed
of having a sister, the other a brother

258
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:04,801
to spend all their time with.

259
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:27,483
Hi, Dad.

260
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:30,498
A new friend?

261
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,748
No, I've had him for years.

262
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:37,708
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

263
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:40,756
There. Let's reconcile them.

264
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:46,254
There. Not bad, eh?

265
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:55,600
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

266
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:59,516
how would it make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

267
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:03,103
I didn't have this gnome when I was a child.

268
00:24:03,156 --> 00:24:06,774
He was a retirement gift from my old regiment.

269
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:11,287
No, I mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

270
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:14,909
I should varnish him before autumn.

271
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:21,460
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

272
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:23,584
Breathe in. Hold still.

273
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:27,386
Better now?

274
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,304
Shut the door!

275
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:31,388
There's a howling gale.

276
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:33,426
It's hardly Siberia.

277
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:36,052
I can see you're not allergic

278
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:40,768
to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

279
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,313
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

280
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:45,945
- What's on the menu today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

281
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:48,446
They'll have you on your knees, you'll see.

282
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:49,691
They're good, then?

283
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:51,950
- Depends where.
- If it's at the toilet...

284
00:24:51,996 --> 00:24:53,277
Not good!

285
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:02,787
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

286
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:05,758
He's going to drive me berserk!

287
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:09,551
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.

288
00:25:09,597 --> 00:25:11,555
Goodbye.

289
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,844
Suzanne.

290
00:25:12,892 --> 00:25:14,801
- Suzanne.
- Yes.

291
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:17,604
"Au gratin" means white sauce, right?

292
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:19,271
Yes, why?

293
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:24,357
I can't stomach it. Like you and horse meat.

294
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:27,156
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

295
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,991
I'd rather cook human flesh.

296
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:32,074
You're kidding!

297
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:47,592
Suzanne, would you mind if I left early today?

298
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:49,675
What's his name?

299
00:25:49,721 --> 00:25:51,797
Dominique Bredoteau.

300
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:59,180
Hello.

301
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:02,224
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

302
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:03,650
That's me.

303
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:05,685
Why?

304
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:07,813
It's about...

305
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,110
...the petition.

306
00:26:10,158 --> 00:26:11,569
Petition?

307
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:16,363
Yes. The petition to...

308
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,700
...to canonise Lady Di.

309
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:21,411
No, thanks.

310
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:22,492
No.

311
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:32,877
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you...

312
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:40,011
- Yes?
- Hello.

313
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:43,728
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

314
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:46,940
Come up. Third floor.

315
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,320
Hello, kitten.

316
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,908
Earl Grey?

317
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:05,037
Jasmine?

318
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,124
What will you have?

319
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:13,471
I'm working.

320
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:25,143
There. I'm coming.

321
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:29,569
Do you know where I can find
Dominique Bredoteau?

322
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:31,901
Oh, my poor dear!

323
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:34,153
You just missed him.

324
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:37,954
Look, there he goes now.

325
00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:48,453
Bre-to-deau.

326
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:51,377
Not Bre-do-teau.

327
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:53,300
You need

328
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:56,844
a glass of mulled wine.

329
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:58,717
Come in.

330
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,012
Come on in.

331
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:07,648
I've lived here for five years.
This is the first time we've met.

332
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:10,480
I never go out on the landing.

333
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:14,526
I'm fussy about who I meet.

334
00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:16,152
They're all creeps anyway.

335
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,944
Come in. Here.

336
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,373
Come in.

337
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:25,990
They call me the Glass Man,

338
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:29,627
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

339
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:35,051
- Amlie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills. I know.

340
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:41,220
And you've come back empty-handed
from your search for Bretodeau.

341
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,978
Because it's not "do", it's "to".

342
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:48,561
- Like "Toto".
- Thank you.

343
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:54,070
I love that painting.

344
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:56,819
It's the Luncheon Of The Boating Party.

345
00:28:58,535 --> 00:28:59,566
By Renoir.

346
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:09,367
I've painted one each year for twenty years.

347
00:29:11,006 --> 00:29:13,711
The hardest part is the looks.

348
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:19,844
I sometimes feel they deliberately change
their mood as soon as my back's turned.

349
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,549
They look quite happy there.

350
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,888
They should be.

351
00:29:23,935 --> 00:29:26,011
This year they had hare with morels.

352
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,849
And waffles with jam for the children.

353
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:36,405
Now, what have I done
with that piece of paper?

354
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:43,907
Ah, you've noticed my video camera
at the window.

355
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:46,624
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

356
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,537
I put it there

357
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:52,504
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

358
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:56,545
After all these years,

359
00:29:56,593 --> 00:30:00,922
the only person I still can't capture

360
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:03,261
is the girl with the glass of water.

361
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:04,802
She's in the middle,

362
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:07,686
yet she's on the outside.

363
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:11,887
Maybe she's just different from the others.

364
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:14,736
In what way?

365
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:17,816
I don't know.

366
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:23,107
When she was little, she can't
have played much with other children.

367
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:27,202
Maybe never.

368
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:32,294
Here.

369
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:36,287
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

370
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:38,873
It's for you.

371
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:45,090
Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken.

372
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:48,261
He usually roasts it
and has it with saut potatoes.

373
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:51,597
After carving the legs,
the breast and the wings,

374
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:55,692
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,

375
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:57,395
starting with the oysters.

376
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:04,406
But not today. Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

377
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:05,912
He'll go no further

378
00:31:05,954 --> 00:31:07,614
than this phone booth here.

379
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:21,318
In a flash, it all came back to him.

380
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:24,566
Federico Bahamontes
winning the Tour de France in '59.

381
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,654
Aunt Josette's slips.

382
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:35,292
And most of all, that tragic day.

383
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,288
That tragic day
when he won all the marbles at break time.

384
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,173
Bretodeau!

385
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:54,516
Bretodeau!

386
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:04,276
The pinch, Bretodeau!

387
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:06,399
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

388
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,500
Cognac, please.

389
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:23,586
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

390
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,845
It must be my guardian angel.
It's the only explanation.

391
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:30,343
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.

392
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,798
It rang and rang.

393
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,397
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

394
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,727
I'll have another cognac.

395
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:52,870
Life's strange.

396
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:59,787
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

397
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,040
All that's left of your childhood

398
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:06,333
fits in a little box,

399
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:07,844
a little rusty box.

400
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:13,802
Have you got kids, miss?

401
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:21,561
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

402
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:27,313
We haven't spoken for years.

403
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:31,319
I heard she had a child, a boy.

404
00:34:32,494 --> 00:34:33,525
His name is Lucas.

405
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:44,670
I think it's time I looked them up
before I'm in a box myself.

406
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:47,425
Don't you think?

407
00:34:55,017 --> 00:34:59,394
Amlie suddenly has a strange feeling
of complete harmony.

408
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:05,393
It's a perfect moment. Soft light,
a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city,

409
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,940
She breathes deeply.
Life seems so simple and clear.

410
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,783
A surge of love,
an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her.

411
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:29,796
Let me help you. Step down.

412
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:32,880
Off we go!
We just passed the drum major's widow!

413
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,931
She's worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.

414
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:39,094
The horse's head on the butcher's
has lost an ear.

415
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:42,679
That's the florist laughing. He has crinkly eyes.

416
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:45,815
In the bakery window there are lollipops!

417
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:47,650
Mmm. Smell that.

418
00:35:47,694 --> 00:35:49,937
They're giving out melon slices.

419
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,071
Sugarplum ice cream!

420
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,787
We're passing the pork butcher.

421
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:59,236
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

422
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,117
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

423
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:08,748
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens roasting.

424
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:12,216
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk
by the mtro.

425
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:14,337
I'll leave you here. Bye.

426
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:08,103
"She can't relate to other people."

427
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:13,189
"She was always a lonely child."

428
00:37:16,158 --> 00:37:19,112
On a sparkling evening in July,

429
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:22,032
while on the beaches holidaymakers

430
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:24,654
relax in the new-found sun,

431
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,247
and in Paris the sweltering crowds

432
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:29,667
gaze at the first bursts

433
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:32,383
of the traditional fireworks,
Amlie Poulain,

434
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:36,173
godmother of outcasts,

435
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,711
Madonna of the unloved,

436
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:40,922
finally succumbs to exhaustion.

437
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:45,720
In Paris' grief-stricken streets,

438
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:48,606
a vast throng of mourners

439
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:51,769
line her funeral route in silence

440
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:56,279
with the measureless sorrow
of newly orphaned children.

441
00:37:57,324 --> 00:37:59,447
What a strange destiny for one

442
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:00,904
who gave her all,

443
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:06,624
yet took such joy in life's simple pleasures.

444
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:10,286
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself

445
00:38:10,338 --> 00:38:13,504
against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries.

446
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,013
It was a losing battle

447
00:38:28,064 --> 00:38:30,056
that claimed her life too soon.

448
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,396
At barely 23, Amlie Poulain

449
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,061
let her young, tired body merge

450
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,529
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

451
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:45,827
As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die

452
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:49,456
without trying to give his stifled life

453
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:53,749
the breath of air she had given

454
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,874
to so many others.

455
00:41:12,145 --> 00:41:13,176
Wait!

456
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,025
Wait!

457
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:23,936
Wait...

458
00:41:25,324 --> 00:41:26,356
Wait, wait!

459
00:42:12,914 --> 00:42:18,335
Pages full of dud ID photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,

460
00:42:18,378 --> 00:42:22,043
carefully reassembled by some oddball.

461
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,166
Some family album!

462
00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:30,929
A pack of Gauloises.

463
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:35,054
Just a second. It's so smoky in here.
Can you tell me where they are?

464
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:37,772
- I can't see a thing.
- More to the left.

465
00:42:37,814 --> 00:42:39,474
- There?
- A bit more. There.

466
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:44,643
Thank you. You need change.

467
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,103
Forget it.

468
00:42:47,156 --> 00:42:49,149
- Yes?
- A mauresque.

469
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,691
A mauresque for the young man.

470
00:42:51,744 --> 00:42:55,160
One kir aligot, one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

471
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:58,492
Was that prenuptial or post-coital smooching?

472
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,619
Is your bullshit congenital?

473
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,706
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry.

474
00:43:04,757 --> 00:43:06,833
You'll find Mr. Right one day.

475
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:11,254
All women want to sleep on a man's shoulder.
All of them.

476
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:16,133
All men snore after a few drinks,
and I have a musical ear.

477
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:19,934
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.

478
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:22,057
I see you're a born romantic.

479
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,611
I see you've never known true love.

480
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:30,520
I did. It shortened my leg.

481
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:36,530
- I thought you fell off a horse.
- I did.

482
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,071
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

483
00:43:39,124 --> 00:43:42,411
I should have known.
They always drop you at the last minute.

484
00:43:42,462 --> 00:43:45,167
He dropped me just before my act.

485
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:50,876
It floored me. And the horse.

486
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,965
With me under it.

487
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:58,264
The mauresque?

488
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:01,228
Still, true love does exist.

489
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:05,222
I'm not saying it doesn't.
After 30 years behind this bar,

490
00:44:05,277 --> 00:44:08,941
I'm an expert. I can even give you the recipe.

491
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:14,034
Take two regulars.

492
00:44:14,077 --> 00:44:17,362
Let each think the other fancies them.
Leave it to simmer.

493
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:19,322
It never fails.

494
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:29,456
Excuse me!

495
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:31,252
Excuse me.

496
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,094
- I've had enough.
- I'll go.

497
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:38,842
Haven't you hurt enough people?

498
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,307
Gina can defend herself.

499
00:44:44,357 --> 00:44:47,607
I don't mean Gina. I mean Georgette.

500
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:51,853
Georgette?

501
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:54,991
Open your eyes! She craves your attention

502
00:44:55,034 --> 00:44:56,826
but you only have eyes for Gina.

503
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,413
Poor girl! The things she does

504
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,534
to catch your eye!

505
00:45:07,088 --> 00:45:09,164
You really must be blind.

506
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,925
I'm off on a date. Bye!

507
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:22,052
Goodbye.

508
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,727
Whoever her new one is,

509
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:30,357
he can't be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder.

510
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,481
Joseph's not so nutty.

511
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:36,276
He's just in pain.

512
00:45:36,326 --> 00:45:39,327
Come off it, Amlie.
They split up two months ago.

513
00:45:39,371 --> 00:45:42,656
To keep on coming here every day,
he must be a masochist.

514
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,743
Don't say you haven't noticed.

515
00:45:47,462 --> 00:45:48,660
Noticed what?

516
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:51,583
He always sits here, right?

517
00:45:51,632 --> 00:45:53,174
Yes.

518
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:54,592
Sit down.

519
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:56,882
Sit down, Georgette.

520
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:02,308
- What can you see?
- My cigarette counter.

521
00:46:03,353 --> 00:46:05,559
And nothing's missing?

522
00:46:05,605 --> 00:46:06,636
No.

523
00:46:07,774 --> 00:46:09,232
Make an effort.

524
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,115
I don't get it!

525
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:21,776
I'll leave you to think about it. Good night.

526
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:41,384
Good morning.

527
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:44,932
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.

528
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:51,645
A mailbag found by climbers
on a glacier on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo

529
00:46:51,693 --> 00:46:55,275
lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.

530
00:46:56,322 --> 00:46:59,821
So sad! A young, pretty princess for once.

531
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:02,275
Would it be less sad if she were old and ugly?

532
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:04,535
Of course. Look at Mother Teresa.

533
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,954
Is he still chasing Gina?

534
00:47:09,002 --> 00:47:11,244
No, he's after somebody else now.

535
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:15,673
- Anyone I know?
- Yes.

536
00:47:15,717 --> 00:47:18,124
Funny about this glacier.

537
00:47:18,177 --> 00:47:21,048
Somebody at The Two Windmills?

538
00:47:21,097 --> 00:47:23,220
Not you, surely!

539
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:24,464
No.

540
00:47:25,686 --> 00:47:28,473
Not Suzanne.

541
00:47:28,522 --> 00:47:30,479
Surely not!

542
00:47:30,524 --> 00:47:32,231
Yes.

543
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:39,438
- Look. There he is again.
- How strange.

544
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,859
- And here.
- Him again.

545
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,488
"Gare de Lyon."

546
00:47:46,372 --> 00:47:47,403
And here.

547
00:47:47,456 --> 00:47:49,117
"March 5th, Austerlitz."

548
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:53,082
Always the same blank expression.

549
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:55,666
Twelve times.

550
00:47:55,715 --> 00:47:58,669
I counted.

551
00:47:58,718 --> 00:48:00,047
It's very odd.

552
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:05,052
Why keep taking your picture all over town
only to throw them away?

553
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,934
Good ones, too.

554
00:48:07,977 --> 00:48:10,848
It's like a sort of ritual.

555
00:48:10,898 --> 00:48:13,104
Maybe he's so terrified

556
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,518
of growing old, it's his only consolation.

557
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,643
He's dead.

558
00:48:20,907 --> 00:48:21,938
Dead?

559
00:48:21,991 --> 00:48:24,826
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.

560
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:29,080
So he uses the photo booths
to remind people what he looks like.

561
00:48:29,123 --> 00:48:33,537
Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife.

562
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:37,584
A dead man who's scared of being forgotten.

563
00:48:37,632 --> 00:48:40,835
At least these guys here have made it.

564
00:48:40,886 --> 00:48:43,008
They're long dead,

565
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:46,968
but they'll never be forgotten.

566
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,766
- The girl with the glass...
- Yes.

567
00:48:51,813 --> 00:48:55,181
Maybe she's distracted
because she's thinking about someone.

568
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,143
Somebody in the picture?

569
00:48:58,779 --> 00:48:59,810
No.

570
00:48:59,863 --> 00:49:02,568
More likely a boy she saw somewhere,

571
00:49:02,616 --> 00:49:06,031
and felt an affinity with.

572
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:12,246
You mean, she'd rather imagine herself
relating to someone who's absent

573
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:17,000
than build relationships with those around her?

574
00:49:19,258 --> 00:49:20,586
No.

575
00:49:20,634 --> 00:49:24,797
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

576
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:26,803
What about her?

577
00:49:26,848 --> 00:49:29,802
And her own messy life?

578
00:49:31,311 --> 00:49:33,387
Who'll fix that?

579
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:38,599
It's better to help people than a garden gnome.

580
00:50:50,432 --> 00:50:55,592
The driver had 2.8g of alcohol in his blood!

581
00:50:55,645 --> 00:50:57,104
Makes me sick!

582
00:50:57,147 --> 00:51:00,101

No radar will ever catch him
while he's working, will it?

587
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:14,194
You shouldn't do that, Mr. Collignon.

588
00:51:14,248 --> 00:51:16,157
It's not his fault.

589
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:17,951
True, Mrs. Cauchoix!

590
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:21,999
It's not his fault he can't sleep. It's Lady Di's.

591
00:51:23,757 --> 00:51:28,134
Guess what I found in the truck.
A lingerie catalogue.

592
00:51:28,178 --> 00:51:32,639
He'd pasted Lady Di's face over the model's.

593
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:36,348
What today? Five asparagus,

00:51:36,395 --> 00:51:38,352

595
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:39,677

The migraine seems to be better.

599
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:11,423
Yes, but my sciatica kept me awake all night.

600
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:15,385
- It's ages since I saw you looking so good.
- Really?

601
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:20,559
A woman without love
withers like a flower without sun.

602
00:52:26,528 --> 00:52:28,604
Strange weather today.

603
00:52:28,655 --> 00:52:30,315
What's so funny?

604
00:52:30,365 --> 00:52:33,698
Everyone who's come in today
has given us a weather report.

605
00:52:33,743 --> 00:52:37,029
We pass the time of day

We do it to keep us from talking crap.

I write crap but nobody wants to publish it.

608
00:52:42,378 --> 00:52:44,951
- Another rejection?
- My thirtieth.

609

Isn't your cousin a book critic?

610
00:52:47,466 --> 00:52:50,502
Forget it! Critics are like leeches

611

sucking the blood of writers.

612
00:52:53,889 --> 00:52:57,388
Is your book a love story?

613
00:52:57,434 --> 00:53:00,553
No, it's about a guy who keeps a journal.

614
00:53:00,603 --> 00:53:02,929
Not about what's happened to him,

615
00:53:02,982 --> 00:53:05,769
but disasters that might happen in the future.

616
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:11,156

- So basically, it's about a loafer.

618
00:53:13,325 --> 00:53:15,994
I'll dedicate the manuscript to you.

00:56:13,046 --> 00:56:14,505
Pretty much.

I feel a change.

636
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:24,723
I had two heart attacks
and had to have an abortion

637
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:27,222
because I did crack while I was pregnant.

01:03:22,434 --> 01:03:23,466
Collignon...

710
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:27,647
- Collignon, big moron, down the john!
- That's it!

711
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:37,647
OK! That's enough for today.

712
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,693
Enough! Enough!

713
01:03:39,744 --> 01:03:42,698
Lucien, stop!

714
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:44,490
Very good.

715
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:49,534
Mr. Dufayel, I found this under your mat.

716
01:05:06,581 --> 01:05:08,620
Still no win!

717
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:10,742
Me neither.

718
01:05:13,796 --> 01:05:14,827
May I?

719
01:05:16,173 --> 01:05:18,249
There's a little...

720
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:25,343
You're gorgeous

721
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:27,099
when you blush.

722
01:05:28,144 --> 01:05:30,516
Like a wild flower.

723
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:33,896
It's my dyspepsia.

724
01:05:35,568 --> 01:05:36,599
Morning, all.

725
01:05:38,154 --> 01:05:39,352
Beautiful day.

726
01:05:58,424 --> 01:06:00,167
Pack of Gitanes, please.

727
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:04,132
Bravo! Vive la France! You scalded me.

728
01:06:04,179 --> 01:06:08,593
Bravo! Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

729
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:14,764
It was Amlie. She...

730
01:06:48,766 --> 01:06:52,763
Do you know what happened
when they went up Mont Blanc?

731
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:55,268
The silicon in her face froze up.

732
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:59,811
Her face was a festering mass!

733
01:07:25,678 --> 01:07:29,462
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.

734
01:07:30,516 --> 01:07:32,176
Thank you.

735
01:07:32,226 --> 01:07:35,429
I was too hard the other day
on the girl with the glass.

736
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,431
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

737
01:07:41,986 --> 01:07:43,018
No.

738
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:45,898
They're into different things.

739
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:49,523
Luck is like the Tour de France.

740
01:07:49,577 --> 01:07:51,653
You wait, and it flashes past you.

741
01:07:53,247 --> 01:07:57,197
You have to catch it while you can.

742
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:23,353
Can I help you?

743
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:26,570
Excuse me.
I found this album in the street and I...

744
01:08:26,614 --> 01:08:31,193
Nino will be so pleased!
He was so sad the other day.

745
01:08:31,244 --> 01:08:33,201
I almost prayed to St Anthony.

746
01:08:34,747 --> 01:08:36,953
Is... Nino there?

747
01:08:36,999 --> 01:08:39,786
No. On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

748
01:08:42,129 --> 01:08:44,205
How long has he had this collection?

749
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:48,718
Since I got him the job here, last year.

750
01:08:48,762 --> 01:08:52,973
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

751
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:58,970
In the daytime
he took pictures of footprints in wet cement.

752
01:08:59,021 --> 01:09:01,180
He's a funny guy.

753
01:09:01,232 --> 01:09:03,521
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

754
01:09:06,695 --> 01:09:08,440
Other things like...

755
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:12,357
Whenever he heard a funny laugh, he'd tape it.

756
01:09:16,539 --> 01:09:17,570
Really?

757
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:22,038
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

758
01:09:22,086 --> 01:09:24,411
He never keeps them long.

759
01:09:24,463 --> 01:09:27,250
Times are hard for dreamers.

760
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:30,088
Eva! Where are those coffees?

761
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:32,592
I'd better go. Thanks for the album.

762
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:36,304
It's OK. I've got time to take it to the funfair.

763
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:40,811
Suit yourself. The ghost train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix, like the street.

764
01:10:05,088 --> 01:10:07,210
I'm looking for Nino. Is he here?

765
01:10:07,256 --> 01:10:09,332
He doesn't get off till seven.

766
01:10:10,885 --> 01:10:13,292
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.

767
01:10:14,638 --> 01:10:16,217
20 francs.

768
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:28,795
See you next Wednesday.

769
01:11:40,475 --> 01:11:44,936
5pm tomorrow, Montmartre carousel
near the phone box. Bring a 5 franc piece.

770
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:05,162
Want to know about her?

771
01:12:07,753 --> 01:12:10,623
- You know her? You saw her?
- You bet.

772
01:12:10,672 --> 01:12:12,665
She put us in her shirt pocket.

773
01:12:13,717 --> 01:12:15,294
Next to her breast.

774
01:12:15,343 --> 01:12:17,252
Is she pretty?

775
01:12:17,303 --> 01:12:19,261
Not bad.

776
01:12:20,306 --> 01:12:22,346
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.

777
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:23,720
- Beautiful.
- Pretty.

778
01:12:23,768 --> 01:12:27,600
- What does she want from you?
- She's broke.

779
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,352
She wants a reward for the album.

780
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,689
Or she collects photos, too.

781
01:12:32,736 --> 01:12:37,030
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!

782
01:12:41,703 --> 01:12:42,734
No, you dope!

783
01:12:44,289 --> 01:12:46,661
She's in love.

784
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:49,459
- I don't even know her.
- Yes, you do.

785
01:12:49,502 --> 01:12:51,329
Since when?

786
01:12:51,379 --> 01:12:53,123
You've always known her.

787
01:12:53,173 --> 01:12:54,453
In your dreams.

788
01:13:07,395 --> 01:13:08,973
Hello?

789
01:13:09,022 --> 01:13:13,102
Yes. You! Man with the plastic bag! It's for you.

790
01:13:14,653 --> 01:13:16,112
- Me?
- Yes.

791
01:13:19,449 --> 01:13:20,480
Thank you.

792
01:13:22,452 --> 01:13:23,483
Hello?

793
01:13:23,536 --> 01:13:26,288
Follow the blue arrows, Mr. Quincampoix.

794
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:56,044
When the finger's pointing to the sky,
only a fool looks at the finger.

795
01:16:08,576 --> 01:16:09,608
Hello?

796
01:16:10,662 --> 01:16:12,987
I know the stranger in the pictures.

797
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:17,120
He's a ghost. He's invisible, Mr. Quincampoix.

798
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:20,538
He only appears when the film is developed.

799
01:16:20,589 --> 01:16:23,958
When a girl has her photo taken,

800
01:16:24,009 --> 01:16:29,963
he goes "Oooh!" in her ear,
while he gently caresses her neck.

801
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:32,588
That's how he got caught, Mr. Quincampoix.

802
01:16:36,312 --> 01:16:37,594
Who are you?

803
01:16:37,648 --> 01:16:39,107

[DO YOU

805
01:16:49,326 --> 01:16:51,152
WANT

806
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:53,658
TO MEET ME?]

807
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,514
Listen to this. "A boy of six,

808
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:36,715
while his parents sleep, drives off

809
01:18:36,767 --> 01:18:38,510
in a pedal car.

810
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,261
Found on a motorway
near Mnster in Germany,

811
01:18:42,314 --> 01:18:45,896
he told the police he wanted to see the stars."

812
01:18:45,942 --> 01:18:49,607
Isn't life beautiful, eh?

813
01:18:49,654 --> 01:18:54,233
Love. The only bug she hadn't caught!

814
01:18:54,285 --> 01:18:57,321
- Nobody's immune.
- At least it gives me a break.

815
01:18:57,371 --> 01:18:59,577
Love's a great beautician.

816
01:19:01,792 --> 01:19:05,243
What's she like? Tall? Small? Blonde? Dark?

817
01:19:07,672 --> 01:19:09,748
Let's say... average height.

818
01:19:11,009 --> 01:19:14,046
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.

819
01:19:15,431 --> 01:19:17,672
Pretty, for her type.

820
01:19:17,725 --> 01:19:20,050
As for blonde or dark...

821
01:19:21,645 --> 01:19:24,729
...it's hard to say, but she wasn't a redhead.

822
01:19:24,773 --> 01:19:26,647
- Unless...
- Forget it.

823
01:19:27,776 --> 01:19:32,651
I do remember she casually asked
if you had a girlfriend.

824
01:19:32,697 --> 01:19:33,728
And?

825
01:19:33,782 --> 01:19:36,238
I said you weren't interested, right?

826
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:39,156
You didn't!

827
01:19:39,205 --> 01:19:41,446
What do you care? You don't even know her.

828
01:19:42,499 --> 01:19:46,711
- Exactly. It's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.

829
01:19:46,753 --> 01:19:48,960
A pound of nectarines, please.

830
01:19:49,006 --> 01:19:51,841
These ones here are the prettiest.

831
01:19:51,883 --> 01:19:54,006
Trust him. He's an artist!

832
01:19:54,052 --> 01:19:57,136
He's been going home every night
with tons of unsold stock.

833
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,348
What for? Is he stewing a pig?

834
01:20:00,392 --> 01:20:02,551
No, sir! He's studying art!

835
01:20:02,603 --> 01:20:06,303
He sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!

836
01:20:06,356 --> 01:20:08,432
The boy's a useless vegetable.

837
01:20:08,484 --> 01:20:09,978
A good prompter

838
01:20:10,027 --> 01:20:13,609
in each cellar window
whispering cutting retorts

839
01:20:13,655 --> 01:20:16,276
would mean shy people had the last laugh.

840
01:20:16,324 --> 01:20:18,780
At least you'll never be a vegetable.

841
01:20:18,827 --> 01:20:21,069
Even artichokes

842
01:20:21,122 --> 01:20:22,153
have hearts.

843
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:28,785
You'll never be a vegetable.
Even artichokes have hearts!

844
01:21:10,212 --> 01:21:11,837
Memory seven.

845
01:21:29,523 --> 01:21:33,770
Darling Mado,
I miss you more and more each day.

846
01:21:33,819 --> 01:21:37,105
I'm an exile in a world of dreary khaki.

847
01:21:37,156 --> 01:21:39,444
I can't sleep, can't eat...

848
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:42,196
This camp was the biggest mistake of my life,

849
01:21:42,244 --> 01:21:46,028
depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks.

850
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:48,951
I think of you endlessly. Your Adrien.

851
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:55,503
I turned down my last month's wages
instead of giving notice.

852
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:59,884
I dream of better times ahead.

853
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:03,926
An orange-coloured day. Remember, my love?

854
01:22:03,974 --> 01:22:06,050
Your ever-loving Adrien.

855
01:22:07,853 --> 01:22:09,263
Good news, darling Mado.

856
01:22:09,312 --> 01:22:12,646
Soon I'll be able to afford a car

857
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:15,183
and drive home every night.

858
01:22:15,236 --> 01:22:19,648
Till then, meet me on Friday and we'll go out.

859
01:25:06,615 --> 01:25:08,821
[MOTHER]

860
01:25:11,662 --> 01:25:13,738

01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:17,367
Hello? Hello?

862
01:25:46,113 --> 01:25:48,569
[WHERE & WHEN?]

863
01:25:58,292 --> 01:26:00,748
One hour later at 11 Boulevard St Martin,

864
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:04,413
Amlie walks into a party goods
and costume shop.

865
01:26:05,466 --> 01:26:09,927
At the same time,
a man leaves his home at 108 Rue Lecourbe.

866
01:26:11,889 --> 01:26:15,637
26 minutes later, Amlie is at the photo booth
at the Gare de I'Est.

867
01:26:19,896 --> 01:26:23,977
Simultaneously,
the man in red shoes parks outside.

868
01:26:24,026 --> 01:26:27,395
The time is exactly 11:40.

869
01:27:13,034 --> 01:27:15,110
At this precise moment,

870
01:27:15,161 --> 01:27:19,906
only Amlie has the key
to the riddle of the mystery man.

871
01:27:24,795 --> 01:27:26,503
How's it going, Mrs. Wells?

872
01:27:26,547 --> 01:27:29,383
It's always better when it's not raining.

873
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:31,881
- This is for you.
- Me?

874
01:27:41,812 --> 01:27:45,513
Dear Mrs. Wells,
We recently recovered a mailbag

875
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:47,642
that was lost in a plane crash

876
01:27:47,693 --> 01:27:51,359
on October 12th 1969 on Mont Blanc.

877
01:27:51,406 --> 01:27:55,866
We are forwarding the enclosed letter
to your address.

878
01:27:55,910 --> 01:28:00,073
Please accept our apologies
for the uncustomary delay.

Darling Mado, I'm in exile.
I can't sleep, can't eat.

881
01:28:08,505 --> 01:28:10,249
I think of you endlessly.

882
01:28:10,299 --> 01:28:14,167
I know I've made
the biggest mistake of my life.

883
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,925
I turned down that woman's money.

884
01:28:16,973 --> 01:28:21,931
If all goes well,
I'll soon be able to afford a house.

885
01:28:21,978 --> 01:28:25,014
I dream of better times ahead

886
01:28:25,064 --> 01:28:28,931
when you'll forgive me and join me here

887
01:28:28,984 --> 01:28:32,353
one orange-coloured day.
Your ever-loving Adrien.

888
01:29:02,185 --> 01:29:04,343
Mr. Dufayel, another package for you.

889
01:29:14,154 --> 01:29:17,404
Mr. Dufayel, do you know
what happened to the concierge?

890
01:29:18,826 --> 01:29:20,155
She got a letter.

891
01:29:21,204 --> 01:29:24,039
From her husband. 40 years late.

892
01:29:26,376 --> 01:29:28,451
That's a lot, isn't it, Mr. Dufayel?

893
01:29:41,682 --> 01:29:45,134
I'm not big on still life, Mr. Dufayel.

894
01:29:45,186 --> 01:29:48,187
Then work on your thin layer.

895
01:29:48,231 --> 01:29:50,982
Fat over thin. Always!

896
01:30:09,836 --> 01:30:11,627
- Mr. Dufayel...
- Yes!

897
01:30:11,671 --> 01:30:16,048
The papers said
that there'll soon be a new star.

898
01:30:16,092 --> 01:30:23,221
- So you're into stars now?
- I saw it on TV at my mum's, that's why.

899
01:30:25,059 --> 01:30:26,802
I don't know if it's true.

900
01:30:26,852 --> 01:30:29,178
In America

901
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:32,516
they're going to take all the rich people's ashes,

902
01:30:32,567 --> 01:30:35,236
put them in a satellite

903
01:30:35,278 --> 01:30:37,603
and shoot it into space.

904
01:30:37,655 --> 01:30:40,027
The satellite's going to shine for ever.

905
01:30:44,662 --> 01:30:46,204
And Lady Di...

906
01:30:46,247 --> 01:30:48,488
Will they do the same for her?

907
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,572
Lady Di, Lady Di!

908
01:30:49,626 --> 01:30:50,871
Give it a rest!

909
01:30:50,919 --> 01:30:53,670
I can't concentrate.

910
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:56,871
Lady Di!

911
01:30:57,967 --> 01:30:58,998
Lady Di!

912
01:31:00,219 --> 01:31:01,250
Renoir.

913
01:32:42,572 --> 01:32:43,603
Morning, sir.

914
01:33:00,339 --> 01:33:01,370
Cambodia.

915
01:33:06,972 --> 01:33:08,715
I don't understand.

916
01:33:08,765 --> 01:33:12,632
Brilliant! You couldn't have done better.

917
01:33:12,685 --> 01:33:15,888
- Did it work?
- It's getting there.

918
01:33:15,938 --> 01:33:18,856
Ask me again any time. The harm's done.

919
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:22,565
- What do you mean?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!

920
01:34:28,302 --> 01:34:31,137
[The Two Windmills caf from 4pm.]

921
01:34:37,646 --> 01:34:39,555
- Eva?
- Yes?

922
01:34:39,606 --> 01:34:43,354
Could you stand in for me at four?

923
01:34:43,401 --> 01:34:45,310
Again?

924
01:34:48,656 --> 01:34:50,115
Close the door!

925
01:34:52,285 --> 01:34:54,277
What's up with him?

926
01:34:54,328 --> 01:34:56,072
Is he sulking?

927
01:34:56,122 --> 01:34:59,705
- He thinks I smile too much.
- He'd rather you frowned?

928
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:02,668
With other men, yes.

929
01:35:05,381 --> 01:35:09,794
Nino is late. Amlie can only think
of two possible explanations.

930
01:35:09,844 --> 01:35:11,920
Firstly, that he didn't find the photo.

931
01:35:13,764 --> 01:35:16,220
Secondly, before he could assemble it,

932
01:35:16,267 --> 01:35:20,562
a gang of bank robbers took him hostage.

933
01:35:20,605 --> 01:35:22,598
The cops gave chase.

934
01:35:22,649 --> 01:35:24,440
They got away,

935
01:35:24,484 --> 01:35:27,236
but he caused a crash.

936
01:35:27,278 --> 01:35:29,485
When he came to,

937
01:35:29,531 --> 01:35:31,190
he'd lost his memory,

938
01:35:33,076 --> 01:35:34,949
An ex-con picked him up,

939
01:35:34,994 --> 01:35:39,205
mistook him for a fugitive,
and shipped him to Istanbul.

940
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:42,408
He met some Afghan raiders,

941
01:35:42,461 --> 01:35:46,043
who took him to steal
some Russian warheads.

942
01:35:49,676 --> 01:35:53,508
But their truck hit a mine
at the border with Tajikistan.

943
01:35:53,555 --> 01:35:59,059
He survived, took to the hills,
and became a Mujaheddin.

944
01:35:59,102 --> 01:36:02,055
Amlie refuses to get upset for a guy

945
01:36:02,104 --> 01:36:06,684
who'll eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cosy.

946
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,127
- What can I get you?
- A coffee, please.

947
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:31,089
A coffee.

948
01:36:53,115 --> 01:36:54,573
Here's your coffee.

949
01:36:56,117 --> 01:36:57,149
Thank you.

950
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:23,176
[Today's menu]

951
01:37:32,195 --> 01:37:33,653
He's understood.

952
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,900
He's going to put his teaspoon down,

953
01:37:38,326 --> 01:37:41,909
dip his finger in the sugar,

954
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:49,372
turn around slowly,

955
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:51,496
and speak to me.

956
01:37:57,095 --> 01:37:59,088
Excuse me.

957
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:01,844
Is this you?

958
01:38:08,314 --> 01:38:09,559
Yes, it's you.

959
01:38:30,253 --> 01:38:32,329
I'll take that.

960
01:38:34,757 --> 01:38:36,417
Another coffee?

961
01:38:36,467 --> 01:38:38,590
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- OK.

962
01:38:59,157 --> 01:39:03,618
So it's this man here,
the one with his hand up?

963
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:05,903
Yes.

964
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:11,120
Is she in love with him?

965
01:39:13,922 --> 01:39:14,953
Yes.

966
01:39:16,883 --> 01:39:20,252
I think it's time she took a real risk.

967
01:39:20,303 --> 01:39:24,799
She might just do that.
She's devising a stratagem.

968
01:39:24,849 --> 01:39:28,515
She's fond of stratagems.

969
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:31,595
Yes.

970
01:39:33,316 --> 01:39:35,439
In fact, she's cowardly.

971
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:40,189
That's why I can't capture her look.

972
01:39:42,033 --> 01:39:47,537
Dufayel's attempts to meddle are intolerable!

973
01:39:50,042 --> 01:39:55,996
If Amlie chooses to live in a dream

974
01:39:56,048 --> 01:40:00,259
and remain an introverted young woman,

975
01:40:00,302 --> 01:40:04,963
she has an absolute right to mess up her life!

976
01:40:39,716 --> 01:40:41,460
What are you doing, Mr. Dufayel?

977
01:40:43,845 --> 01:40:45,968
Tell me, Lucien.

978
01:40:46,014 --> 01:40:50,889
For deliveries,
do you keep keys to all the apartments?

979
01:41:03,365 --> 01:41:07,232
One of your booths is out of order.

980
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:11,909
It seems to be jammed.

981
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:15,329
Gare de I'Est ticket hall.

982
01:41:18,171 --> 01:41:20,544
- Buy a video, get one free.
- No, thanks.

983
01:41:27,305 --> 01:41:28,965
Sam?

984
01:41:30,016 --> 01:41:31,048
Samantha?

985
01:41:34,396 --> 01:41:35,427
Samantha?

986
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,270
Can you stand in for me at...

987
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:08,383
Photo booth, Gare de I'Est ticket hall,
Tuesday 5pm.

988
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:11,764
[Can you stand in for me this afternoon?]

989
01:43:23,005 --> 01:43:24,333
Almost done.

990
01:43:29,469 --> 01:43:33,515
The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of ageing,

991
01:43:33,557 --> 01:43:35,633
but simply the repairman,

992
01:43:35,684 --> 01:43:38,140
a normal guy doing his job.

993
01:43:40,272 --> 01:43:41,932
Sorry.

994
01:44:27,569 --> 01:44:30,938
He keeps spying on me!
It's making me sick.

995
01:44:30,989 --> 01:44:34,405
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

996
01:44:35,452 --> 01:44:38,903
Gosh, you're tense, Georgette!

997
01:44:39,956 --> 01:44:41,499
Good luck. You'll need it.

998
01:44:46,922 --> 01:44:51,500
Excuse me. Did you put this in my pocket?

999
01:44:51,552 --> 01:44:54,967
- Yes, but I'm not the one...
- I know. Where is she?

1000
01:44:55,013 --> 01:44:56,555
She's at her father's.

1001
01:44:56,598 --> 01:45:02,019
It's awkward. I'd like to speak to you, but...
I finish work at six.

1002
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:04,020
- Can you come back?
- OK.

1003
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:06,145
See you later.

1004
01:45:06,192 --> 01:45:09,774
4:08: Docking scheduled.

1005
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:46,263
The blond guy in a camel coat.
He's very absent-minded, too.

1006
01:45:46,314 --> 01:45:48,059
How come?

1007
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:51,565
He came back three times the same afternoon.

1008
01:45:52,821 --> 01:45:54,102
1:12:

1009
01:45:54,156 --> 01:45:55,436
Camel coat.

1010
01:45:55,491 --> 01:45:56,736
2:50:

1011
01:45:56,784 --> 01:45:58,610
Camel coat.

1012
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:00,867
- 4:17: Camel coat.
- Stop it!

1013
01:46:01,914 --> 01:46:05,117
My rash has come back! Look, Suzanne!

1014
01:46:05,167 --> 01:46:08,867
My rash is back. He's driving me nuts.

1015
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:11,080
Lay off!

1016
01:46:11,132 --> 01:46:15,425
If she had a clear conscience,
she wouldn't be in such a state.

1017
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:17,426
I've had it. I'm going home.

1018
01:46:17,471 --> 01:46:20,970
Psychos are the last straw!

1019
01:46:22,351 --> 01:46:24,390
Georgette! Georg...

1020
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:28,731
Stop smothering them!
Women need to breathe.

1021
01:46:28,774 --> 01:46:32,059
You let them breathe,
they want a change of air.

1022
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:33,985
Fresh air's healthy.

1023
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:36,022
Shut it, failure!

1024
01:46:38,576 --> 01:46:40,283
Failed writer, failed life...

1025
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:42,901
I love the word "fail".

1026
01:46:42,955 --> 01:46:44,994
Failure is human destiny.

1027
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,618
It's gasbag time!

1028
01:46:46,667 --> 01:46:49,917
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft,

1029
01:46:49,961 --> 01:46:53,829
a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.

1030
01:46:55,259 --> 01:46:57,584
I bet he stole that.

1031
01:46:57,637 --> 01:47:00,127
I do have some original ideas,

1032
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:05,637
but people always steal them.
A bit like your women.

1033
01:47:05,686 --> 01:47:07,725
Meaning?

1034
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:10,974
Meaning you'd better get used to it.

1035
01:47:11,024 --> 01:47:13,562
Speak for yourself, you...

1036
01:47:13,610 --> 01:47:14,641
What?

1037
01:47:18,407 --> 01:47:21,527
- What's going on?
- Nothing much. Georgette went out.

1038
01:47:21,577 --> 01:47:23,320
Joseph got mad.

1039
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:24,865
"Went out?"

1040
01:47:24,914 --> 01:47:30,121
Just like Gina. You know who's she's with?
The guy with the plastic bag.

1041
01:47:31,837 --> 01:47:34,209
I saw their little game.

1042
01:47:34,256 --> 01:47:36,581
The note in the coat pocket,

1043
01:47:36,633 --> 01:47:38,258
4:08.

1044
01:47:38,301 --> 01:47:42,252
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

1045
01:47:46,185 --> 01:47:49,850
- I'm worried for Amlie because I like you.
- What do you mean?

1046
01:47:50,898 --> 01:47:54,682
By and large, the men I like
are mentally unsound.

1047
01:47:54,735 --> 01:47:57,771
- I'd like to know more about you.
- Ask me questions.

1048
01:48:00,574 --> 01:48:02,366
One swallow doesn't make...?

1049
01:48:03,452 --> 01:48:04,484
A swallow?

1050
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,622
A summer.

1051
01:48:07,665 --> 01:48:09,040
And clothes...?

1052
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:10,625
The man.

1053
01:48:10,668 --> 01:48:12,078
- A good cat deserves...?
- A rat.

1054
01:48:12,127 --> 01:48:13,787
- Patience...?
- Is a virtue.

1055
01:48:13,837 --> 01:48:15,415
- Rolling stone...?
- Gathers no moss.

1056
01:48:15,464 --> 01:48:17,789
- It's a sin...?
- To steal a pin.

1057
01:48:17,841 --> 01:48:19,834
Absence makes...?

1058
01:48:19,885 --> 01:48:21,344
The heart grow fonder.

1059
01:48:21,386 --> 01:48:23,379
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

1060
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:27,760
In my family, we say a man
who knows his proverbs can't be all bad.

1061
01:48:32,356 --> 01:48:35,807
Pretty girl from the 5th floor, listen to this!

1062
01:48:35,859 --> 01:48:38,813
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Not today.

1063
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:42,397
You're in for a surprise.

1064
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:45,782
What if I told you that a team of climbers

1065
01:48:45,827 --> 01:48:49,778
on Mont Blanc had found

1066
01:48:49,832 --> 01:48:54,458
hard proof that my husband loved me?

1067
01:49:27,828 --> 01:49:29,951
Lucien, I need some yeast.

1068
01:49:29,997 --> 01:49:33,912
For Miss Amlie?
She's baking her famous plum cake?

1069
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,914
Collignon! Go and get the yeast.

1070
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:32,724
Amlie?

1071
01:50:32,768 --> 01:50:33,799
Amlie?

1072
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,183
Amlie?

1073
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:05,081
[I'll be back]

1074
01:51:36,165 --> 01:51:39,166
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

1075
01:51:55,226 --> 01:51:58,345
So, little Amlie,

1076
01:51:58,396 --> 01:52:02,475
your bones aren't made of glass.

1077
01:52:02,524 --> 01:52:05,644
You can take life's knocks.

1078
01:52:05,694 --> 01:52:10,072
If you let this chance go by,

1079
01:52:10,116 --> 01:52:16,783
eventually your heart will become

1080
01:52:16,831 --> 01:52:22,869
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

1081
01:52:24,505 --> 01:52:26,047
So...

1082
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:29,256
Go and get him, for pete's sake!

1083
01:55:16,761 --> 01:55:22,597
[Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's]

1084
01:56:18,907 --> 01:56:20,615
International airport.

1085
01:56:20,658 --> 01:56:25,700
September 28th 1997. It is exactly 11am.

1086
01:56:25,747 --> 01:56:28,451
At the funfair, near the ghost train,

1087
01:56:28,499 --> 01:56:31,666
the marshmallow twister is twisting.

1088
01:56:31,711 --> 01:56:33,999
Meanwhile, on a bench in Villette Square,

1089
01:56:34,046 --> 01:56:39,503
Flix Lerbier learns there are more links
in his brain than atoms in the universe.

1090
01:56:40,595 --> 01:56:41,710
Meanwhile,

1091
01:56:41,763 --> 01:56:45,428
at the Sacr Cur,
the nuns are practising their backhand.

1092
01:56:45,475 --> 01:56:47,882
The temperature is 24C,

1093
01:56:47,936 --> 01:56:49,809
humidity 70%,

1094
01:56:49,854 --> 01:56:53,104
atmospheric pressure 999 millibars.
