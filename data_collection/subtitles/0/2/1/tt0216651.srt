1
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:17,647
Luke!!!

2
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:06,491
Luke!

3
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,655
Luke!!!

4
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:25,949
Luke!!

5
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,718
Luke!!!

6
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,192
A werewolf!

7
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:12,965
An aristocrat!

8
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,393
You must be a wandering hunter?!

9
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,837
You can talk, can't you?

10
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:23,846
Is that sword just for show?

11
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:25,678
Can I take it?

12
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,549
Good defense!

13
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:51,642
You're not as good as I thought!!

14
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:55,076
Now, leave the sword
you have on your back and go!

15
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:15,156
Wait! You're a hunter just like
I thought, and...you must be...

16
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:17,096
...a vampire hunter!!

17
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:22,369
Am I right? I'm sorry.
I apologize for my rudeness.

18
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,269
I wanted to test your skill.

19
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,571
I...I will hire you!!

20
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,011
I need you!!

21
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,482
L...Look at this!

22
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:38,688
The kiss mark from a Count.

23
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,440
What is your name?

24
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,672
Doris Ran.
Can you take this job?

25
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,182
I will pay you any reward.

26
00:10:05,518 --> 00:10:07,213
T. ..three meals a day, and...

27
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:10,886
you can sleep with me too.

28
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:13,086
When did the Count attack you?

29
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,658
Are you taking my offer?!

30
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:55,326
Damn!

31
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,235
Sister!

32
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:01,703
Dan!

33
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,874
I'll board itfor you.

34
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,180
Wow!
This is a DL4 model cyborg horse!

35
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,852
Hey you don't talk much, do you?

36
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:24,353
Dr. Felingo said
there are 2 types of quiet men.

37
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,658
Those who are always thinking
about something bad, and...

38
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,168
those with experience,
who don't say unnecessary things.

39
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,768
I think you are the second one.

40
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,300
Because you look really cool!

41
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,160
Hey, Doris!

42
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:38,996
Greco...

43
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,541
I guess the rumors are true.

44
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:44,835
W...what are you talking about?

45
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:49,273
Well I want to talk to you about that.

46
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:02,251
What do you want to talk about?

47
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:06,732
Let's see...the story that
you were attacked by the Count.

48
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,131
I don't know what do you mean!

49
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,130
Hey, hey, don't raise your voice.

50
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:14,234
Don't you care if your
brother hears about that?

51
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:20,169
Well, Doris, why didn't
you tell me about this?

52
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,974
I'm the Mayor's son in this village.

53
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:26,943
I can hire as many
hunters as you want.

54
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:28,544
Much better than the one you hired.

55
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:29,910
How's that?

56
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:32,284
I will even forget
about what you did to me.

57
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:34,259
So why don't
you just do what I say.

58
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:39,358
W...what the hell?!
That hurts... !

59
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,333
Don't get fresh with me!

60
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:48,796
Doris, I'm worried about you.
I'm trying to help you.

61
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:51,808
Don't even think you
can demand my gratitude!

62
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:55,673
I know so many people who've had
awful experiences with you!

63
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,874
You're cute when you're angry...

64
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,886
but totally unruly.

65
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,478
Now be mature and do as I say.

66
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:06,451
You bitch!
Don't think that I'm so easy!

67
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:24,670
B...Boss...

68
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:29,281
Hey, everybody! Listen to this!
Doris was attacked by the Count!

69
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,215
The vampire bit her!

70
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:34,081
That's why she hired the hunter!

71
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:47,223
Sister!!

72
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,938
Then you are a hunter?

73
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,273
Yes.

74
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:09,245
Doris...you...?

75
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:13,959
Sister...

76
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,225
I knew I was right.

77
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,760
No! My sister was never
attacked by the Count.

78
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,790
Loser!
Just because she turned you down.

79
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,395
W...w...what?!

80
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:25,027
You little brat!

81
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:25,993
Greco!

82
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:26,936
But, father!

83
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,997
They're making a fool out of me!

84
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,267
We are talking about an important
issue in the village right now.

85
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:32,435
Go some place else!

86
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:33,442
Damn!!

87
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:37,143
Anyway, we can't let you loose
since you were bitten by the vampire.

88
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,081
I have to send you to the asylum.

89
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:40,982
Sheriff!

90
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:43,652
Stop it!

91
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:45,417
I won't let you take
my sister anywhere!

92
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,416
Wait a minute, Sheriff.

93
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:50,093
That asylum is no place
for humans to live.

94
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:53,993
That place is worse than a pigsty.
As a doctor, I absolutely object!

95
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,267
Besides, that place has been
abandoned for more than 50 years.

96
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,530
I can't make any exceptions, Doctor.
It's the law of this village.

97
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,434
Roman, don't you
remember what happened ...

98
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,340
when we used
that place 50 years ago?

99
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,971
What happened 50 years ago?

100
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:14,083
There was a woman who was
attacked by a Count, like Doris.

101
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:17,485
We locked her in the asylum,
but it evoked the Count's rage...

102
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,581
and 30 villagers were
brutally murdered.

103
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,326
What happened to that woman?

104
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,460
She became insane
and died in the asylum.

105
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:36,636
Can you hold off Doris' punishment
until I finish my assignment?

106
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:39,073
What?

107
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:43,278
Y...you look very confident
but...you must deal with vampires.

108
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:44,878
If you fail...

109
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,983
If he fails, I will kill myself!

110
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:50,555
Sister!

111
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:06,171
Dan, listen to me carefully.

112
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:10,542
Welcome...

113
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:13,812
Can I have one month's
worth of fertilizer,...

114
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:17,507
and five packs of dried meat,
also some can foods?

115
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,416
Sorry, but all are sold out.

116
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:22,745
Mr. Weitory!

117
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:27,683
Weitory! What're you talking about?
You have plenty of stock here.

118
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,795
Doctor! All my other
customers have run away.

119
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:33,497
I can't sell anything to
the friends of a vampire!

120
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:35,764
What?!

121
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:39,394
Things will be
harder from now on.

122
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:44,132
Dan, you can cry as
much as you want...

123
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:47,135
but, don't ever
let your sister cry.

124
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:49,614
If you think your tears
will make your sister cry...

125
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,547
then you should hold them back.

126
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:55,343
No matter how difficult, you should
smile and encourage your sister.

127
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:57,812
You have to be a man now.

128
00:17:58,891 --> 00:17:59,880
Do you understand?

129
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,481
What is the matter with you today?
You're acting strangely.

130
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:01,041
Protecting the girl,
and encouraging her brother...

131
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,579
I don't know what's got into you.

132
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:06,517
Don't tell me you've fallen
in love with that girl.

133
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,286
Don't be silly!

134
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:11,554
That's it, isn't it?

135
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:15,760
Although she offered you her body,
I don't think that's what you want.

136
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:17,959
Your only interest
has been hunting aristocrats.

137
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:22,639
A bloody life,
that's been your destiny.

138
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:25,203
Perhaps now, you long for
the love of a human being?

139
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:27,869
It can never be...
a man like you...

140
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:29,711
Oops...

141
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:33,280
Thank you for this afternoon.
You must have told Dan something?

142
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,577
He keeps trying to encourage me.

143
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:40,792
My father was a hunter too,
a Werewolf hunter.

144
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:44,055
But he didn't know
anything about aristocrats.

145
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,423
"You should only ask
vampire hunters about aristocrats."

146
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:48,563
"The other hunters
have no knowledge of them. "

147
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:51,159
My father always said that.

148
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:54,101
D, please tell me more about them.

149
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,132
Tomorrow is the "Moon of Woman".

150
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:57,903
"Moon of Woman"?

151
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,205
Is that when the red moon
comes out once every month?

152
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,180
Aristocrats detest biting for blood
on that night...

153
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:04,273
because they believe this moon
causes the flow of impure blood.

154
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,683
This means some messenger from the
castle may come tonight to take you.

155
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:09,984
Who is the Count that lives there?

156
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,622
His name is Count Lee.

157
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:14,659
He's been ruling this land
long before our village established.

158
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:17,018
He had disappeared
for a long time, but...

159
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:21,326
his castle lit up two years ago,
and we realized he had come back.

160
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:25,268
He supposed be five thousand
to ten thousand years old.

161
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:28,498
He must be incredibly old anyway.

162
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:35,236
Ten thousand years old...
he could be a difficult enemy.

163
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:16,479
Here they come.

164
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,790
How do you want to fight?
I'll fight with you.

165
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:26,932
You can't beat them
with a cross or garlic.

166
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,537
They keep mutants and werewolves
for fighting.

167
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,547
I guess you hired a bodyguard.

168
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,981
A cheap idea that only
low class humans would think of.

169
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:30,056
A woman...?
What happened to the Count?

170
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:35,864
My father told me that this girl
is unusually beautiful,...

171
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:39,767
for a human in this village, and her
blood is extremely tasty and mild.

172
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,499
So I came to look at her.

173
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:44,675
But she is a fool and not
worthy of our clan.

174
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,836
She forgets that we are the rulers
by acting against us impertinently.

175
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,244
It can not be forgiven!

176
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,616
I will kill you in the
bloodiest way first...

177
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,241
and then destroy this girl slowly.

178
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:56,745
As you wish.

179
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:58,983
I'm Ray Ginsay.

180
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,987
My job is to destroy humans like you.

181
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:03,458
Prepare to die!

182
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:32,980
You are much more than I expected.

183
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:35,489
Then I will have to be more serious too.

184
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:12,458
Uh...I see...

185
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:15,533
I've heard about a mutant
who can warp space...

186
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,459
Is that you?

187
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:24,173
Too bad for you!
Now, I will take your head.

188
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:31,381
Y...you bastard!

189
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:36,317
Well.

190
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:38,546
This man is a dampiel.

191
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:43,390
Ray, I will take care of him.

192
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:44,587
But...Countess...

193
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:45,491
Get back!

194
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,900
I understand...Countess...

195
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:54,666
A dampiel?
This is the first time I've met one.

196
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,831
Some Count must've had fun.

197
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:59,569
You are the evil consequence of
a low class woman and a Count!

198
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:01,441
You are worse than human!

199
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:05,315
Girl, my business is with the Count.

200
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,315
I don't want to have to kill you.

201
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:12,687
Shut up! You, a dampiel,
think you can beat me?!

202
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:26,231
Go back to the castle,
and tell the Count...

203
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:30,066
the destiny of a transient visitor
is going back to the darkness.

204
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,267
A transient visitor?

205
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:51,686
Have Ramica and the others returned?

206
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:57,092
They took action selfishly,
without asking my permission...

207
00:25:57,736 --> 00:25:59,966
I will think about
their punishment later.

208
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:02,797
What...a Dampiel?

209
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:06,577
You say Ramica and Ray
were forced to retreat by a Dampiel?

210
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:12,880
Interesting,
one more thing for my enjoyment.

211
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:20,023
Ancestor God, Count Dracula!

212
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:22,456
My father is wrong.

213
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:28,021
He is trying to invite a low class
girl into our noble Lee family.

214
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:31,431
I can't let him foolishly...

215
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,198
I can't let him foolishly...

216
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:41,545
Lady Ramica,
please go back to your room.

217
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:44,113
I have no reason
to listen to your orders.

218
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,282
The Count scolded me
for what we did tonight.

219
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,317
He ordered that you
should not leave your room.

220
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:53,056
Now, come with me.

221
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:54,953
Ray!

222
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,950
Don't ever touch me again!

223
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:59,630
Well, you seem to be
ingratiating yourself with my father...

224
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:00,927
to join the Count's family.

225
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,090
But you can't change
your low class identity.

226
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:06,665
A person who has
such disgusting blood...

227
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,468
should neverjoin our family.
I will never let that happen!

228
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:48,931
D, watch out...it's a trap!

229
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:50,492
I know.

230
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:13,417
A phantom beast!

231
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:22,594
Over there?!

232
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:50,685
We meet again.

233
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:57,361
Well, you dodged my Jagar boy,
and you still have an arm.

234
00:30:57,836 --> 00:31:00,430
You truly are a dampiel.

235
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:11,076
I want to continue the fight
from yesterday, right now.

236
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:15,175
But I have to guide you
somewhere by the Count's order.

237
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,558
I told you this was a trap.

238
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:09,669
This is the aftermath of a war
that took place ten thousand years ago.

239
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:12,242
This is a really
telling view of that world.

240
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:47,636
Who are you?

241
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,672
Who are you?

242
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:54,267
Why don't you answer?

243
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,146
Why don't you answer?

244
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:58,276
Who are you three?

245
00:33:58,516 --> 00:33:59,574
We are...

246
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:01,849
We are...

247
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:06,421
This kind!

248
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:23,029
Y...you!

249
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:33,676
We are the famous
Snake Women of Midwitch!

250
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,449
Big sister, we haven't had
fresh prey for a long time.

251
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:39,581
Let's enjoy sucking this man's energy.

252
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:43,385
Sure! We'll all take his life energy,
down to the marrow in his bones.

253
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:08,249
Doris, don't worry. He'll come back.
He looked like a man made from steel.

254
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,380
He won't die so easily.

255
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,421
Doris...are you in love with him?!

256
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:18,359
That's not a good idea!

257
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:20,727
He is not the kind
of man you think he is.

258
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,795
He may not be a bad person,
but he has dangerous eyes.

259
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,430
Dangerous eyes?

260
00:35:26,538 --> 00:35:29,996
Eyes that went through
so many dangerous battles.

261
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:33,269
He is not the kind of
man who will accept you.

262
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:05,299
Well, lady, the Count
has been waiting for you.

263
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:08,936
Let Dan and Dr. Felingo go!!

264
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:12,646
Too bad!
Fresh meat is their favorite!

265
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,682
I...if you do that,
I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.

266
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:23,154
The Count ordered me
to bring you without injury.

267
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,319
I guess I have no choice.

268
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,722
Put your tongue back inside
your mouth. It's bad manners.

269
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:40,203
Well Doris, tomorrow, you can
finally join an aristocrat's family.

270
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,711
So why don't you stop bluffing?

271
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:44,511
You'll see!

272
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:47,845
I will get out from this
musty castle tonight!

273
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,047
You are cute.
You will become my wife soon...

274
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:56,422
so I will forgive your impudence,
for now.

275
00:36:57,095 --> 00:37:02,032
By the way, Doris, you seem to
think that hunter will rescue you.

276
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,847
D!!

277
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:21,408
Those snake women are
sucking out all his energy.

278
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,817
Look at them.
They are in the height of pleasure.

279
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:26,847
They have been intoxicated
by his worthless pleasure...

280
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:28,358
for more than halfthe day.

281
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,388
A normal man would
have died in five minutes.

282
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:33,124
But it's no wonder,
since he is a dampiel

283
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,657
Dampiel?!

284
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:37,800
Are you saying D is a dampiel?

285
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:40,371
Oh, didn't you know that?

286
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:44,037
Our aristocrats have slept with
lower class women for fun.

287
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,869
He was born of mixed blood.

288
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:46,676
What's wrong?

289
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:50,677
Doris, look at them well.
Don't you think it's exciting?

290
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:53,013
No! Stop it!

291
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:57,447
All right! You better go to your
bedroom and rest well tonight.

292
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:07,064
Tomorrow is our wedding...
my dear Doris...

293
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:09,995
Tonight it seems that
even the moon is jealous of me.

294
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:29,416
What kind of man is he?
He is overwhelming us.

295
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:32,582
Really overwhelming us.

296
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:46,630
Oh no?! He's...?!

297
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,221
Is my father trying to invite
this woman into the Lee family?

298
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,654
This woman will
become my mother?

299
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,414
Like father, like son...

300
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,387
No matter how much you reject it,
you'll bare your fangs anyway.

301
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:39,455
Shut up.

302
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,258
Are you angry again?
This is your destiny.

303
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:44,284
There is nothing you
can do about it.

304
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:46,956
Damn you!
Do you want me to cut you off?

305
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:48,999
All right...I won't talk anymore.

306
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:54,361
What part of her is
my father so attracted to?

307
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,840
I'll never let you join the Lee family.
I, Ramica, will never accept it!

308
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:04,347
Bastard?!

309
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,417
Gorem!

310
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:46,339
Gorem!

311
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:06,560
I've got you!

312
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:18,766
Gimlet!

313
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:27,877
I can't go back into the
castle, until I kill him.

314
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:39,257
Sister.

315
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:40,423
Sister!

316
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,998
D...Dan. Where is D?

317
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:48,599
He is fixing the wall outside.

318
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,032
By the way,
I think he's really strong.

319
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:55,570
He rescued you all by himself
from such a horrible place.

320
00:43:56,414 --> 00:44:00,043
Besides, he didn't even
rest after he came back.

321
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:02,779
He started working
to fix the wall, right away.

322
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:05,255
It's the aristocrat!

323
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:06,848
It's the aristocrat's carriage!

324
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:08,050
Why are they here?

325
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:12,823
What is wrong with you?

326
00:44:12,964 --> 00:44:15,728
Let's go inside
the hotel and drink more.

327
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,762
You go home now!

328
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:19,727
What's going on?

329
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:24,530
Hey, old man!

330
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:26,676
A messenger
from the aristocrat is here.

331
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:29,505
I know! Give me
the key to the monitor room!

332
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:34,042
The Count has sent me.

333
00:44:34,852 --> 00:44:38,344
What do you want?
Did he tell you to execute me?

334
00:44:39,156 --> 00:44:44,822
No, that's absurd. You think
I can beat you with my skill?

335
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:51,362
Impudence is rewarded with death.
That's the law to protect the castle.

336
00:44:57,308 --> 00:45:01,768
The Count wants
you to use this to kill him.

337
00:45:03,547 --> 00:45:06,277
Could this be
the Incense of Time Trap.

338
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:08,752
Indeed.

339
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,446
Incense of Time Trap?

340
00:45:27,204 --> 00:45:28,466
D!! Did you find Dan?

341
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:30,372
Dan was kidnapped.

342
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:31,697
That's Dan's gun!

343
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:35,206
I'm the one they want to take.
Why did they take my brother?

344
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,711
What does it say?
Let me see!

345
00:45:38,015 --> 00:45:38,709
What is this?!

346
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:44,153
Don't bother. This is a language
only understood between assassins.

347
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:47,853
It says, if I want to save Dan's life,
I have to go over there by myself.

348
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:51,017
They are trying to separate us.

349
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:54,554
Why Dan?
Why notjust tell me to go over there?

350
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:58,829
Because, the person who wrote this
letter wants to conclude the battle.

351
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:04,474
And if he used the boy to get you, it
would stain the aristocrat's honor.

352
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:06,939
Screw the aristocrat's honor!

353
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:09,912
Aristocrats are all
monsters who suck human blood.

354
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:13,772
I...I'm sorry.

355
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:18,647
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because you know I'm a dampiel?

356
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:22,059
My blood is mixed with
the aristocrats whom you hate.

357
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,327
I understand.

358
00:46:24,428 --> 00:46:27,920
You didn't tell us because you
didn't want us to worry unnecessarily.

359
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:30,667
It's better that I didn't know.

360
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:39,401
You made it.

361
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:40,634
What did you do with Dan?

362
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:44,205
Brother D!

363
00:46:44,548 --> 00:46:46,209
Help me!!!

364
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:51,313
Little boy! I will get you down
after I kill this man.

365
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:53,114
Why don't you be quiet and wait there.

366
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:58,823
Brother D, I'm scared!!!

367
00:46:58,963 --> 00:46:59,657
You bastard!

368
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:01,895
Now, let's begin.

369
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,584
D Watch out! This smells of
the Incense of Time Trap.

370
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,344
It...it wont light!

371
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:38,698
Dan, Dan, please come back safe.

372
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:40,736
If you die...

373
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:43,300
Doris, it's me. Felingo!

374
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:44,339
Doctor!!

375
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:46,204
Doris, can you turn off
the switch for the barrier.

376
00:47:46,677 --> 00:47:47,701
Doctor!!

377
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:51,513
Doctor, Doctor!
Dan was...Dan was...

378
00:47:51,615 --> 00:47:53,242
I had to take care of
an emergency patient.

379
00:47:53,517 --> 00:47:57,146
I'm sorry for being late.
Come with me right now.

380
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:01,422
I don't know why you and Dan
have to go through this difficulty.

381
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:06,561
My hand!
Somebody cheated me!

382
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,531
You've got fake incense.
You must have been set up.

383
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,331
Now throw away your
worthless ambition.

384
00:48:12,937 --> 00:48:15,804
Bastard!
You'll never understand my feelings!

385
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:22,712
Doctor, is there really such a place?

386
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,871
I found it in the Northern forest.

387
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:28,316
I passed it when I was on my
way back from Mr. Parker's.

388
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:31,615
It's an ancient building with
some engravings on it's walls.

389
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:35,955
Later, I found out it's a building
that blocks the power of vampires.

390
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:41,760
We'll be safe there
and that man will rescue Dan.

391
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:42,760
You're right!

392
00:48:53,744 --> 00:48:54,904
The Count's daughter!

393
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:56,674
Whoa, whoa!

394
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:58,380
Doris, turn us around!

395
00:48:58,482 --> 00:48:59,380
There's no room here!

396
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:00,973
I'll take care of her!

397
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,084
Doctor!! Dr. Felingo!!

398
00:49:10,094 --> 00:49:11,026
That was...

399
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:12,059
my name...

400
00:49:12,096 --> 00:49:13,654
until yesterday!

401
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:16,532
Doctor! Doctor!! No!!!

402
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,767
No...Doctor...
not you too?

403
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:22,967
Hey!

404
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:25,475
Lady Ramica, why are you here?

405
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,470
The Count's plan was for me
to take her to the castle.

406
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,974
Get her down.

407
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:31,772
Yes.

408
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:37,617
I have always thought
of this girl as my daughter.

409
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:39,884
But seeing her now,
she is really beautiful...

410
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,788
and I wonder why
I never raped her.

411
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:44,751
The Count really has good taste.

412
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:50,798
In truth, I want to ask the Count
to share her leftover blood with me.

413
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:53,232
Hey, cretin!

414
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,098
Doctor!!

415
00:49:58,509 --> 00:49:59,601
D...Doris?

416
00:50:01,512 --> 00:50:02,570
D...Doctor!!

417
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:08,342
Doctor...

418
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:12,618
This is hopeless!
He and Dan might be already...

419
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:15,790
He...you mean that dampiel?

420
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:20,460
I would rather die than
become an aristocrat.

421
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:22,729
Everything is my father's fault.

422
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:26,901
This is pointless. Just go
where my father can't find you.

423
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:45,787
You?!

424
00:50:58,068 --> 00:50:59,194
Greco?!

425
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:00,764
It really works...

426
00:51:01,038 --> 00:51:03,131
this Incense of Time Trap.

427
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:08,639
It's supposed to blind vampires,
but it really makes them suffer.

428
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:10,537
What are you doing with that thing?

429
00:51:11,014 --> 00:51:13,812
What's important is we have
the Count's daughter as our hostage.

430
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:17,354
Everything will be fine if we
can make a deal with the Count.

431
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:18,879
Your planning to...

432
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:21,550
lure the Count out, and take his life.

433
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:24,155
This Incense of Time Trap
will do the job easily.

434
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:27,363
But I have one condition.
You must promise to marry me.

435
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:28,594
Greco...?!

436
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:31,058
If you say no,
I'll just leave now.

437
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:33,431
If you marry me,
we can get the Count's treasure...

438
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,062
and control the village, too.

439
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:36,771
Stop it! It hurt my eyes.

440
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:39,103
You don't look so well, Doris?

441
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:42,636
Don't worry,
I'll take care of you from now on.

442
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:47,105
Well, she's good looking when
I see her face close up.

443
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:50,618
I thought vampire girls
looked like monsters.

444
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:52,945
Kill me! Right here...right now!

445
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,358
You still have strength to be snooty?

446
00:51:57,528 --> 00:52:02,363
Kill me now! I'd rather die than be
captured by lowly creatures like you!

447
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,090
What? You little brat!

448
00:52:05,235 --> 00:52:08,693
Kill me! If you don't kill me now,
I will surely kill you later!

449
00:52:08,872 --> 00:52:10,533
All right! I will give you death!

450
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:13,508
Even if I kill you,
I can still lure the Count out!

451
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:15,902
Stop doing that!
She can't even fight back!!

452
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:17,512
She said I'm a lowly creature!

453
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:18,710
Doris!?

454
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:25,186
Sister!

455
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:28,090
Dan? Is that you?

456
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:29,786
Sister, are you all right?

457
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:31,692
Dan, you're still alive!

458
00:52:31,795 --> 00:52:32,591
Dan!

459
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:39,162
I see.
The Doctor...

460
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,961
I thought you were dead.

461
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:44,303
I didn't care if I died, too.

462
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:46,632
Sister, you should be stronger!

463
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:49,341
Brother D said we
should never give up!

464
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,640
Dan...you are...

465
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,487
Go back to your castle,
it's not far from here.

466
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:03,791
You're not going to kill me?

467
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:08,225
Of course not, why should we
act like cowards who kill women!

468
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:10,925
I'll tell you why he is helping you.

469
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:12,165
You see...

470
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:16,670
he wouldn't allow anyone helpless
to be killed, even a vampire.

471
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,032
I am notjust "anyone" in
the lower class. I'm an aristocrat.

472
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:23,504
Love or feelings do
not exist in our world.

473
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:27,450
The only rule in our world is that the
weak become the victims of the strong.

474
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:29,684
Thus, the aristocrats
control the lowly humans.

475
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,745
A world where the weak
become the victims of the strong...

476
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:36,053
Your Ancient God
didn't teach such things.

477
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:40,552
The Ancient God?

478
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,077
D, would you like to take a shower?

479
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,187
D ...D!

480
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:09,756
D...

481
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,024
What's wrong?

482
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:12,456
I'm glad you are here.

483
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:15,056
I was worried that you
might have left again.

484
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:18,764
I'm sorry I said mean
things to you earlier.

485
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:21,869
I don't mind.
I've gotten used to it already.

486
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:24,063
I don't want you to
end up like my father.

487
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:28,408
Just because of he was a hunter,
he was forced to fight with vampires.

488
00:54:29,212 --> 00:54:30,839
We've fought enough.

489
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:33,478
Let's go some place
else together to live.

490
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:35,544
I can't do that.

491
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:36,548
Why?!

492
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:38,621
You would be even
more unhappy, then you are now.

493
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:40,121
That's not true!

494
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:43,054
I ...I don't want you to die!

495
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:44,221
Stop it!

496
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:46,694
No! Let me stay
like this for a while.

497
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:20,892
It's all right.
Take my blood.

498
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,644
D.

499
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:39,882
Forgive me...

500
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:44,113
Why can't you be honest
with your feelings?

501
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:47,417
Do you think every part of
yourself is cursed so badly?

502
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:52,861
You can't even grant a woman's wish.
Why can't you even be a dampiel?

503
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:54,721
Your father was...

504
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:55,797
Shut up!

505
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:57,158
Yeah, yeah...

506
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:03,235
Damn!

507
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:08,310
Well, at least I saved
this Incense of Time trap.

508
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:11,079
It was you?!

509
00:56:12,049 --> 00:56:13,209
Wait a minute!

510
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:16,351
I can't wait.
I have to kill you.

511
00:56:57,494 --> 00:56:58,552
You bastard!

512
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:18,345
I'm sorry, since you were kind
enough to let me go free last time.

513
00:57:22,886 --> 00:57:24,012
Bastard!

514
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,785
Oh, you're really strong!
How is this?

515
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:55,674
Aristocrat,
eternal youth...

516
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:22,100
What kind of a man is he?

517
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:38,087
Now we are even.

518
00:58:40,697 --> 00:58:41,356
D!

519
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:43,193
D! Are you still alive?!

520
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:44,160
D!

521
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:49,464
Brother, brother, wake up!
Open your eyes!

522
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:51,198
D!

523
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:57,111
Is he...dead?

524
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:41,180
You really are a stubborn girl.

525
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,650
Father, this is my last request.

526
00:59:44,895 --> 00:59:46,886
Please cancel the wedding tonight.

527
00:59:47,197 --> 00:59:49,665
If you let that low
class girl into our family...

528
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,468
Ramica, the wedding tonight...

529
00:59:52,535 --> 00:59:55,527
is only temporal
entertainment in my long life.

530
00:59:56,806 --> 00:59:59,297
I know I will get
bored of her someday.

531
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:02,444
After that,
I will look for a new girl.

532
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:05,004
I'm doing this solely for pleasure.

533
01:00:05,315 --> 01:00:08,478
Father, then I will kill her!

534
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:10,714
Otherwise,
the Lee family will collapse.

535
01:00:11,221 --> 01:00:13,018
Ramica, listen to me!

536
01:00:13,356 --> 01:00:16,848
The Lee family will not collapse
even if we invite a human girl...

537
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:22,021
because Ramica, your own
mother was the same as that girl.

538
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,292
She also came from
the lower class.

539
01:00:29,272 --> 01:00:32,366
I have been living for
ten thousand years, in this world.

540
01:00:32,575 --> 01:00:35,009
I don't think you
understand what that means.

541
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:38,746
Only boredom and
weariness surrounds me.

542
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:41,917
The best medicine for that is
to have some enjoyment...

543
01:00:42,552 --> 01:00:45,282
with a lower class woman,
like your mother.

544
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:52,484
Poor humans live their small
lives while aristocrats like us...

545
01:00:52,595 --> 01:00:54,893
rule their land.

546
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:57,794
When you consider that...

547
01:00:57,867 --> 01:01:00,859
finding pleasure once every fifty to
a hundred years is not a big deal.

548
01:01:01,104 --> 01:01:03,698
Father, take your false story back!

549
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,141
It's not a false story.

550
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:08,200
Your mother truly
belonged to lower class, but...

551
01:01:15,618 --> 01:01:20,681
Ramica, your high pride
is purely aristocratic.

552
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,589
However, I don't want you
to disturb my wedding.

553
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,594
You should calm
yourself down for a while.

554
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:28,389
Count...

555
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:31,123
I ask you to do as you promised.

556
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:32,861
Promise?

557
01:01:33,536 --> 01:01:36,903
Yes, to give me eternal youth
as a new member of the aristocracy.

558
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,104
You idiot! You did
so much blundering this time.

559
01:01:40,176 --> 01:01:42,701
You should appreciate
that I've kept you alive.

560
01:01:43,446 --> 01:01:45,437
Forget about eternal youth?!

561
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:47,706
Or wait for fifty years more.

562
01:01:51,521 --> 01:01:52,715
Fifty years?!

563
01:01:59,062 --> 01:02:02,293
Let's move.
He really gives me trouble.

564
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:10,797
What?

565
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:23,111
Oh, crap!
We have to hurry!

566
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:07,353
Hey, what's the matter?
Can't you move?

567
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:12,530
What's wrong D?
Wake up!

568
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:15,067
This isn't funny.
They found us.

569
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:19,870
Hey! What's wrong with you?
Move, move!

570
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:21,704
Hey D?
What happened to you?

571
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:23,869
Move! Move!

572
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:25,708
Please move!
Move...move!

573
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:29,382
Hey you! Move! Hey!
What are you doing?

574
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:41,253
Oh well, I guess we made it.

575
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:14,193
Sister.

576
01:04:26,876 --> 01:04:27,740
Sister.

577
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:32,781
Sister!!

578
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:14,686
Ray, don't be rude.
Get out of our way.

579
01:05:15,758 --> 01:05:17,817
This is the end of your life.

580
01:05:29,906 --> 01:05:33,967
Wait for fifty years?
What do you think of our fifty years?!

581
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,968
I lost my left hand because of you,
and I had all my friends killed.

582
01:05:38,615 --> 01:05:41,948
I don't care anymore!
I will make sure you die here too!

583
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:51,819
Did you actually think
that would work on me?

584
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:06,808
So long Ray.

585
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,907
What a fun day!

586
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:21,751
It is rare for me, in my life,
to have such a satisfying day.

587
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:40,904
We'd like to congratulate our Lord,
Count Magnus Lee, and his new wife.

588
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:43,404
I appreciate everybody's blessing.

589
01:06:53,122 --> 01:06:56,580
You are the first woman
to give me such difficulty.

590
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:14,535
It's you?!

591
01:07:19,482 --> 01:07:21,609
Vampires disappeared
for a long period of time.

592
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,082
Vampires are only
transient visitors in this world.

593
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:27,446
Transient visitors?

594
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:31,220
Vampires, and this castle, are
merely ghosts forgotten by time.

595
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:33,628
Go back to
the world where you belong!

596
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:36,998
That's very funny.

597
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,294
You are a dampiel, one who
was created out of our pleasure.

598
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:43,067
Do you think you can beat me?

599
01:07:44,173 --> 01:07:46,801
I will have my fun
after taking care of you.

600
01:08:12,869 --> 01:08:14,427
You look so miserable!

601
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:18,971
You are just a dampiel anyway.
I don't know why you hunt us...

602
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:21,977
but there is no way you could
win against a pure vampire.

603
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:26,709
Well then, let me kill you
in a different way from Ray.

604
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:36,356
I don't know how many
vampires you have killed ...

605
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:39,388
but what you are doing
is killing your own people.

606
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:42,257
Why don't you kill
yourself by that sword.

607
01:08:48,104 --> 01:08:49,901
Who the hell are you?!

608
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:39,117
Sister!

609
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:40,153
Stop!!

610
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:42,754
Dan?

611
01:09:45,428 --> 01:09:47,191
Sister! Sister!

612
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:54,532
Ra...Ramica, what are you doing?
Why don't you fight for me?!

613
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:59,766
Father, enough is enough!
The Lee family will be destroyed.

614
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:01,169
W...what?!

615
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:05,940
Since you wanted her and
forgot the pride of aristocracy.

616
01:10:08,317 --> 01:10:09,443
R...ridiculous!

617
01:10:25,668 --> 01:10:26,896
A...are you?!

618
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:29,764
M...maybe a prince...

619
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:32,405
...the son of our ancient god?!

620
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:47,718
D ...ancient god...I will be destroyed
with my father in this castle.

621
01:10:49,091 --> 01:10:50,922
I am not the Ancient God.

622
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,488
I am an aristocrat.

623
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:55,096
If our ancient god tells
us to be destroyed ...

624
01:10:55,197 --> 01:10:56,926
we should follow your word.

625
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:00,869
I am just a dampiel, like you.

626
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:03,705
You have human blood inside you.

627
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:06,767
You can still live when you
take off the veil of an aristocrat.

628
01:11:07,143 --> 01:11:09,907
No...I am a pure aristocrat.

629
01:11:10,613 --> 01:11:12,604
I don't have any
low class blood inside me.

630
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:19,249
D!

631
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:20,747
Brother D!

632
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:23,081
I...I am pure aristocrat!

633
01:14:13,162 --> 01:14:14,891
Brother, brother!

634
01:14:14,964 --> 01:14:15,692
D!

635
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:18,561
Brother!

636
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:21,597
Brother!

637
01:14:21,637 --> 01:14:22,501
D!

638
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:25,232
Brother!

639
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:26,104
D!!

640
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:29,571
Brother!

641
01:14:29,645 --> 01:14:30,270
D!!!

642
01:14:31,714 --> 01:14:32,908
D!!!

643
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:33,642
Brother!

644
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:36,007
Brother!

645
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:37,378
D!!!

646
01:14:37,787 --> 01:14:38,947
Brother!

647
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:39,919
D!!!
