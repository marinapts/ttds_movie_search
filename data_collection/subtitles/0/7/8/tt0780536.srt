1
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,727
<i>After I killed them, I
dropped the gun in the Thames,</i>

2
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,992
<i>washed the residue off me hands
in the bathroom of a Burger King,</i>

3
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>and walked home
to await instructions.</i>

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,932
<i>Shortly thereafter, the
instructions came through.</i>

5
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,772
<i>"Get the fuck out of London,
youse dumb fucks.</i>

6
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,434
<i>"Get to Bruges."</i>

7
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,913
<i>I didn't even know
where Bruges fucking was.</i>

8
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,544
<i>It's in Belgium.</i>

9
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,246
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

10
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,690
<i>Bruges is
not a shithole.</i>

11
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,784
<i>Bruges is a shithole.</i>

12
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,852
<i>Ray, we've only just got
off the fucking train.</i>

13
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,831
<i>Could we reserve judgment on Bruges
until we've seen the fucking place?</i>

14
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,457
<i>I know it's gonna be
a shithole.</i>

15
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,191
Shithole.

16
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,970
I think you have a couple of rooms
booked under Cranham and Blakely?

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,237
Yes. No, we have
one room booked.

18
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,346
One twin room.
Booked for two weeks.

19
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,579
Two weeks!

20
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,376
Do you have
another room?

21
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,009
No, I'm afraid
we're fully booked.

22
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,021
With Christmas,
everywhere is fully booked.

23
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,116
Okay.

24
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,063
It's very pretty.

25
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,655
I'm not being funny,
we can't stay here.

26
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,633
We've got to stay here
until he rings.

27
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,066
Well, what if he doesn't
ring for two weeks?

28
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,763
Then we stay here
for two weeks.

29
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,638
For two weeks? In fucking Bruges?
In a room like this?

30
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,335
With you? No way!

31
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,139
Ray, I really don't
like to say this...

32
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,579
You really don't
like to say what?

33
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,378
Well... You know?

34
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,785
Fucking bring that up.

35
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,489
Do you think
this is good?

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,585
Do I think what's good?

37
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,859
You know, going round in
a boat, looking at stuff.

38
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,431
Yes, I do.

39
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,028
<i>It's called "sightseeing."</i>

40
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,475
Oh, look at that.

41
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,344
It's a former hospital.
From the 1100s.

42
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,728
Bruges is the most
well-preserved medieval town

43
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,195
in the whole of
Belgium, apparently.

44
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,485
Coming up?
What's up there?

45
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,217
The view.

46
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,058
The view of what? The view of down
here? I can see that from down here.

47
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,463
Ray, you're about the worst
tourist in the whole world.

48
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,934
Ken, I grew up in Dublin.
I love Dublin.

49
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,666
If I'd grown up on a farm and was
retarded, Bruges might impress me.

50
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,867
But I didn't,
so it doesn't.

51
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,615
Trying to get rid
of me coins.

52
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,751
2, 2.50, 4,

53
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:33,322
4.10, 4.20, 4.30,
4.40, 4.50, 4.60,

54
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,629
4.70,

55
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,226
4.80,

56
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,435
4.90.

57
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,972
Will you take 4.90?

58
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,944
Entry is 5 euro.

59
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,613
Come on, man,
it's only 10 cents.

60
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,048
Entry is 5 euro.

61
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,828
Happy in your work?

62
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:05,921
Very happy.

63
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,759
I like it here.

64
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,065
Been to the top
of the tower?

65
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,625
Yeah. Yeah, it's rubbish.

66
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,763
<i>It is? The guidebook says
it's a "must-see".</i>

67
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,332
Well, you lot
ain't going up there.

68
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,002
Pardon me? Why?

69
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,014
I mean, it's all windy stairs.
I'm not being funny.

70
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,573
What exactly are you
trying to say?

71
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,311
What exactly
am I trying to say?

72
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,788
Youse are a bunch
of fucking elephants!

73
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,347
Right, you...

74
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,623
Come on, leave it, fatty.

75
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,578
You know, you're just the
rudest man. The rudest man!

76
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,147
What's all that about?

77
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,550
They're not going up there.

78
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,056
Hey, guys, I wouldn't go up
there. It's really narrow.

79
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,148
Screw you, motherfucker!

80
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,327
Americans, isn't it?

81
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,266
Now, this is more like it.
Proper holidays.

82
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,863
One gay beer
for my gay friend,

83
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,602
and one normal beer for me,
because I am normal.

84
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,210
This is the life.

85
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,873
We're not staying here
getting pissed.

86
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,147
We are quietly sightseeing,
like he says,

87
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,879
and awaiting his call
to see what we do next.

88
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,887
This is my vote
on what we should do.

89
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,549
We give it another day,
two days, max.

90
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,458
Then we check the papers again, and
if there's still nothing in them,

91
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,793
<i>we phone him and say, "Harry,
thank you for the trip to Bruges,</i>

92
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,298
<i>"it's been very nice, all
the old buildings and that,</i>

93
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,097
<i>"but we're coming back to London
now, and hide out in a proper country,</i>

94
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,433
<i>"where it isn't all just
fucking chocolates."</i>

95
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,997
My vote would be we quietly
sightsee, like he says,

96
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,509
and await his call
to see what we do next.

97
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,279
You don't even know
we're here hiding out.

98
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,453
What are you talking about?

99
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,819
You don't even know
we're not here on a job.

100
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,915
What, on a job?
Yeah.

101
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,516
Here in Bruges?
Yeah.

102
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,994
Here in Bruges, on a job?
Yeah.

103
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,425
Why? What did he
actually say?

104
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,932
He didn't actually
say anything.

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,901
Then why do you think it might
be? I don't think anything.

106
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,939
But it's a bit fucking
over-elaborate, isn't it?

107
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,531
<i>"Go take him to hide out."
"Go take him to hide out where?"</i>

108
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,510
<i>"Go take him to hide out
in fucking Bruges."</i>

109
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,074
You can hide out
in Croydon.

110
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,406
Hmm.

111
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,985
Or Coventry.

112
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,345
Hmm.

113
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,652
It is a bit
over-elaborate.

114
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,752
Hmm.

115
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,397
But we haven't
got any guns.

116
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,765
Harry can get guns anywhere.

117
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,185
He's not gonna ring tonight.

118
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,993
He's not gonna ring tonight.

119
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,095
Let's go out.

120
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,106
Go out where?
The pub.

121
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,198
No!

122
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,527
Let's go out and have
a look at some of the...

123
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,258
All the old medieval
buildings and that.

124
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,893
Because I bet they look even
better at night, all lit up.

125
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,465
Yes!

126
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,942
That there is called
the Gruuthuse Museum.

127
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,079
They all have funny
names, don't they?

128
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,646
Yes, Flemish.

129
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,658
<i>In here it says, "The Belgians twice
sheltered fugitive English Kings</i>

130
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,629
<i>"from being murdered,
1471 and 1651."</i>

131
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,030
I used to hate history,
didn't you?

132
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,500
It's all just a load of stuff
that's already happened.

133
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,503
What are they
doing over there?

134
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,199
They're filming something.
They're filming midgets!

135
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,868
Ray!

136
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:58,074
So, on this scene, you're supposed
to walk like a little, tiny mouse, yeah?

137
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,355
Okay? Great.

138
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,924
Ray, come on, let's go.

139
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,826
<i>My arse, "Let's go."
They're filming midgets.</i>

140
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,462
Oh, my God!
Look at that girl.

141
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,058
She's gorgeous!

142
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,330
Ray, we're going
right now.

143
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,894
Fuck off, are we!

144
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,806
This is the best bit of Bruges
so far. You and your buildings.

145
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,494
Hello.

146
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,832
Do you speak English?
No.

147
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,872
Yes, you do.
Everybody does.

148
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,572
What are you
filming midgets for?

149
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,014
It's a Dutch movie.
It's a dream sequence.

150
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,451
<i>It's a pastiche of Nicholas
Roeg's Don't Look Now.</i>

151
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,489
Not a pastiche, but a...

152
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,084
<i>A "homage" is too strong.
A" nod of the head"?</i>

153
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,794
Wow, your English
is very good.

154
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,166
A lot of midgets
tend to kill themselves.

155
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,939
A disproportionate amount.

156
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,503
<i>Herv Villechaize,
off of Fantasy Island.</i>

157
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,614
<i>I think somebody
off The Time Bandits.</i>

158
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,950
I suppose they must
get really sad about, like,

159
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,053
being really
little and that.

160
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,719
People looking at them
and laughing at them.

161
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,059
<i>Calling them names.
You know, "shortarse."</i>

162
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,792
There's another famous midget
I'm missing, but I can't remember.

163
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,769
It's not the R2-D2 man.
No, he's still going.

164
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,772
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself.
Your dream sequence will be fucked.

165
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,971
<i>He doesn't like being called
a midget. He prefers "dwarf."</i>

166
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,450
Well, this is
exactly my point!

167
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,647
People go around calling you a midget
when you want to be called a dwarf.

168
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,555
Of course you're
gonna blow your head off!

169
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,023
My name's Ray. What's yours?
Chloe.

170
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,193
How did you get past
the security man?

171
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,600
Getting past security men,
it's sort of my job.

172
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,637
You're a shoplifter?

173
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,764
No,
not a shoplifter.

174
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,808
It's a good joke, though.

175
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,936
No.

176
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,510
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

177
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,891
Fuck.

178
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,709
How fucking cool.

179
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,588
Mr. Blakely?

180
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,357
Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.
No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

181
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,131
You have a message.

182
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,499
Shit!

183
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,572
<i>Number one, why aren't you
in when I fucking told you to be in?</i>

184
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,773
<i>Number two, why doesn't this hotel
have phones with fucking voicemail</i>

185
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,612
<i>and not I have to leave messages
with the fucking receptionist?</i>

186
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,586
<i>Number three, you better fucking be in
tomorrow night when I fucking call again</i>

187
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,784
<i>or there'll be fucking Hell to
pay, I'm fucking telling you. Harry.</i>

188
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,530
Would you turn
the fucking light off!

189
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,122
Sorry, Ken.

190
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,327
Keep the fucking
noise down!

191
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,268
Someone's in a mood.

192
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,813
You'll
never guess what.

193
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,982
Will you shut your fucking
mouth, please, and go to sleep?

194
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,719
Oh, sorry.

195
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,223
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out.

196
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,808
Altogether,

197
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,343
I had

198
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,579
five pints of beer
and six bottles.

199
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:35,382
No. Six pints of beer
and seven bottles.

200
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,082
And you know what?
I'm not even pissed!

201
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,191
You'll never guess what, Ken.

202
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,993
Ken, you'll never guess what.
What?

203
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,195
Got a date for
tomorrow night.

204
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,362
I'm very happy for you.

205
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,564
With a girl.

206
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,901
Can you turn
the light off, please?

207
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,874
Only been in Bruges one day, got a
date with a girl in the film business,

208
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,002
the Belgian film business.

209
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,805
They're doing a film
about a midget.

210
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,293
Miss?

211
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,296
Marie?

212
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,977
Sorry about the message last night.
The man who left it is a bit of a...

213
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,437
Well, he's a bit of a...

214
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,141
Cock?

215
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,343
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

216
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,851
Morning.

217
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,125
Harry called last night.

218
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,293
We missed him.

219
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,575
Jeez, he swears a lot,
doesn't he?

220
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,837
We're staying in tonight.
Whatever happens.

221
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,642
Hmm.

222
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,315
Except...

223
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,185
Hmm.
Hmm.

224
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,948
<i>Except "hmm" what?</i>

225
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:23,791
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

226
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,090
Uh-huh.

227
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,327
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

228
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,834
I thought you
didn't like Bruges.

229
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,700
I don't like Bruges,
it's a shithole.

230
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,571
But I did already say I had
a date with a Belgian lady

231
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,703
in the Belgian film business, which
I did already say about before.

232
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,914
Just don't get into
any fucking trouble.

233
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,113
We're keeping a low profile.

234
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:54,453
And this morning,
and this afternoon,

235
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,892
we are doing
what I want to do.

236
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,725
Got it?
Of course.

237
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,498
Which, I presume,
will involve culture.

238
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,298
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

239
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,932
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the balance
shall tip in the favor of culture.

240
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,811
Like a big, fat, fucking
retarded, fucking black girl

241
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,576
on a seesaw, opposite

242
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,582
a dwarf.

243
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,251
Ray, did we
or did we not agree

244
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,816
that if I let you
go on your date tonight,

245
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,862
we'd do the things
I wanted to do today?

246
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,795
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

247
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,425
And that we'd do them without
you throwing a fucking moody,

248
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,867
like some 5-year-old who's
dropped all his sweets?

249
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,905
I didn't agree to that.

250
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,867
I'll cheer up.
I'll cheer up.

251
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,245
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

252
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,505
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

253
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,177
And that phial, do you know
what it's said to contain?

254
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,810
No, what's it
said to contain?

255
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:32,846
It's said to contain some
drops of Jesus Christ's blood.

256
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,655
Yeah, that's how this church got
its name. Basilica of the Holy Blood.

257
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,093
Yeah. Yeah.

258
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,030
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

259
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,194
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid.

260
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,932
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood.

261
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,133
At various times of great

262
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,971
stress.

263
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,342
Yeah?
Yeah.

264
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:59,510
So, yeah, I'm gonna go up in the queue
and touch it, which is what you do.

265
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,745
Yeah?
Yeah. You coming?

266
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,278
Do I have to?

267
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,759
Do you have to?
Of course you don't have to.

268
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,695
It's Jesus' fucking blood, isn't it?
Of course you don't fucking have to!

269
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,289
Of course you don't
fucking have to!

270
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,202
You little fucking cunt.

271
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,138
<i>Murder, Father.</i>

272
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,813
<i>Why did you
murder someone, Raymond?</i>

273
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,445
For money, Father.

274
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,220
For money?

275
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,258
You murdered
someone for money?

276
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,315
Yes, Father.

277
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,659
Not out of anger, not
out of nothing. For money.

278
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,927
Who did you murder
for money, Raymond?

279
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,102
You, Father.

280
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,334
I'm sorry?

281
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,104
I said you, Father.
What, are you deaf?

282
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,513
Harry Waters says hello.

283
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,395
The little boy.

284
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,098
I quite like this one.

285
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:20,440
All the rest were rubbish by
spastics, but this one's quite good.

286
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,537
What's that
all about, then?

287
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,545
It's Judgment Day, you know?
Oh, yeah.

288
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,080
What's that then?

289
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,252
Well, it's, you know,
the final day on Earth.

290
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:42,023
When mankind will be judged for all
the crimes they've committed and that.

291
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,038
And see who gets into Heaven and
who gets into Hell and all that?

292
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,163
Yeah.

293
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,036
And what's the other place?

294
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,336
Purgatory.

295
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,673
Purgatory?

296
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,839
Purgatory's kind of like
the in-betweeny one.

297
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,908
You weren't really shit, but you
weren't all that great, either.

298
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,077
Like Tottenham.

299
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,490
Do you believe
in all that stuff, Ken?

300
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,048
About Tottenham?

301
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,492
The Last Judgment
and the afterlife.

302
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,457
Guilt and sins and

303
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,733
Hell and all that?

304
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,397
Um...

305
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,801
Well...

306
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,480
I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

307
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,315
The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

308
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,658
So, like, I believe in
trying to lead a good life.

309
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,392
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

310
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:52,197
I don't try and help her carry
her shopping, I don't go that far,

311
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,468
but I'll certainly hold the door open for
her and that, and let her go out before me.

312
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,668
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried
to help her carry her shopping,

313
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,677
she'd probably think you were
just trying to nick her shopping.

314
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,578
Exactly.
This is the world we live in today.

315
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,981
At the same time as
trying to lead a good life,

316
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,687
I have to reconcile myself with the
fact that, yes, I have killed people.

317
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,185
Not many people. Most of them
were not very nice people.

318
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,890
Apart from one person.

319
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,363
Who's that?

320
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,867
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother.

321
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,393
He was just trying to protect
his brother. Like you or I would.

322
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,770
He was just a lollipop man.

323
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:33,299
He came at me with a bottle.
What are you gonna do?

324
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,777
I shot him down.

325
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:35,835
Hmm.

326
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,348
In my book, though, sorry,
someone comes at you with a bottle,

327
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,978
that is a deadly weapon, he's
gotta take the consequences.

328
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,453
I know that in my heart.

329
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,820
I also know that he was just trying
to protect his brother, you know?

330
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,257
I know. But a bottle,
that can kill you.

331
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,521
It's a case of
it's you or him.

332
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,495
If he'd come at you with his
bare hands, that'd be different.

333
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,588
That wouldn't
have been fair.

334
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,031
Well, technically, your bare
hands can kill somebody, too.

335
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,899
They can be deadly weapons, too. I
mean, what if he knew karate, say?

336
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,198
You said he was
a lollipop man.

337
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,102
He was a lollipop man.

338
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,437
What's a lollipop man doing
knowing fucking karate?

339
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,533
I'm just saying.

340
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,170
How old was he?
About 50.

341
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,680
What's a 50-year-old lollipop
man doing knowing fucking karate?

342
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,115
What was he,
a Chinese lollipop man?

343
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,278
Jesus, Ken, I'm
trying to talk about...

344
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,596
I know what you're
trying to talk about.

345
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,963
I killed a little boy. You keep
bringing up fucking lollipop men!

346
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,797
You didn't mean
to kill a little boy.

347
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,838
I know I didn't mean to.

348
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,401
But because of the choices I made
and the course that I put into action,

349
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,741
a little boy
isn't here anymore.

350
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,043
And he'll never
be here again.

351
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,645
I mean here in the world,
not here in Belgium.

352
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,918
Well, he'll never be here
in Belgium, either, will he?

353
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,292
I mean, he might have wanted
to come here when he got older.

354
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,990
I don't know why.

355
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,761
And that's all because of me.

356
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,964
He's dead because of me.

357
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,472
And I'm trying to...

358
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,405
I'm trying to get me head
around it, but I can't.

359
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,377
I will always have
killed that little boy.

360
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,751
That ain't ever
going away. Ever.

361
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,450
Unless...

362
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,416
Maybe I go away.

363
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,423
Don't even think like that.

364
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,511
You look good.

365
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,862
What's it matter anyway?

366
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,745
So, what do you do, Raymond?

367
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,723
I shoot people for money.

368
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,324
What kinds of people?

369
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,696
Priests. Children.
You know, the usual.

370
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,792
Is there a lot of money to be
made in that line of business?

371
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,894
There is in priests.
There isn't in children.

372
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,233
So what is it
you do, Chloe?

373
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,400
I sell cocaine and heroin
to Belgian film crews.

374
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,070
Do you?

375
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,410
Do I look like I do?

376
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,575
You do, actually.

377
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,488
Do I look like
I shoot people?

378
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:41,782
No.

379
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,185
Just children.

380
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,992
Mmm-hmm.

381
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,137
I saw your midget today.
Little prick didn't even say hello.

382
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,072
Well, he's on
a lot of ketamine.

383
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,575
What's that?

384
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,678
Horse tranquilizer.

385
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,339
A horse tranquilizer?

386
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,883
Where'd he get that?
I sold it to him.

387
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,045
You can't sell horse
tranquilizers to a midget!

388
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,589
This movie, I think it's
gonna be a very good one.

389
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,060
There's never been a classic
movie made in Bruges until now.

390
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,756
Of course there hasn't,
it's a shithole.

391
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,093
Bruges is my hometown, Ray.

392
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,359
Well, it's still a shithole.

393
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,457
It's not a shithole.

394
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,059
What? Even midgets have to
take drugs to stick it.

395
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,399
Okay.

396
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,070
So, you've insulted
my hometown.

397
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,544
You're doing
very well, Raymond.

398
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:38,047
Why don't you tell me some
Belgian jokes while you're at it?

399
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,708
I don't know
any Belgian jokes.

400
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:43,083
And if I did,
I think I'd have the good sense not to...

401
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:47,648
Hey, hang on. Is Belgium where there
were all those child abuse murders lately?

402
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,955
Then I do know
a Belgian joke.

403
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,355
What's Belgium famous for?

404
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,232
Chocolates and child abuse.

405
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,895
And they only invented the
chocolates to get to the kids.

406
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,267
What?

407
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,173
One of the girls they
murdered was a friend of mine.

408
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,581
I'm sorry, Chloe.

409
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,158
One of the girls they murdered
wasn't a friend of mine.

410
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,964
I just wanted to
make you feel bad.

411
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,369
And it worked.
Quite well.

412
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,789
Fucking unbelievable.

413
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,837
What's fucking
unbelievable?

414
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,774
Are you talking to me?

415
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,576
He pauses, even though
he should just hit the cunt.

416
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,014
And he repeats.

417
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:24,487
Yes, I am talking to you.
What's fucking unbelievable?

418
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,887
Well, I'll tell you what's
fucking unbelievable, shall I?

419
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,620
Blowing cigarette smoke straight
into myself and my girlfriend's face.

420
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,922
That's fucking unbelievable!

421
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,158
This is the smoking section. I don't
care if it's the smoking section.

422
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,598
All right?
She directed it right in my face, man.

423
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,602
I don't wanna die just because
of your fucking arrogance. Uh-huh.

424
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,639
Isn't that what the
Vietnamese used to say?

425
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,904
Vietnamese? What are you
talking about, the Vietnamese?

426
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,706
That statement makes
no fucking sense at all.

427
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,643
Yes it does.
The Vietnamese!

428
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,376
Well, saying it over and over ain't
gonna make any more sense out of it.

429
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,317
How does the Vietnamese
have any relevance whatsoever

430
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,911
to myself and my girlfriend
having to breathe

431
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,650
your friend's
cigarette smoke?

432
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,783
Tell me how saying...

433
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,454
That's for John Lennon,
you Yankee fucking cunt!

434
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,228
A bottle? No, don't bother.

435
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,741
We're leaving.

436
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,214
I don't hit women!
I would never hit a woman, Chloe!

437
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,177
I'd hit a woman who was
trying to hit me with a bottle!

438
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,984
That's different.
That's self-defense, isn't it?

439
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,457
Or a woman
who could do karate.

440
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,223
I'd never hit a woman generally, Chloe.
Don't think that.

441
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,026
God, you're pretty.

442
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,467
I have to make a call.

443
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,559
Oh, no.

444
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,732
You've gone off me, now, haven't you?
Just because I hit that fucking cow.

445
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,132
<i>Hello?
- Where the fuck were you yesterday?</i>

446
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,833
We just popped out for some dinner,
Harry. We only popped out for half an hour.

447
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,396
<i>Yeah? What'd you have?</i>

448
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,271
<i>For dinner?
Yeah.</i>

449
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,503
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

450
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,635
<i>Was it nice?</i>

451
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,612
Yeah, it was all right. I
don't know. It was Pizza Hut.

452
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,170
The same as in England.

453
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,980
<i>Well, that's globalization,
isn't it? Is Ray there with you?</i>

454
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,620
He's in the toilet.

455
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,883
<i>Can he hear?
No.</i>

456
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,652
<i>What's he doing?</i>

457
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,889
<i>What do you mean?
Is he doing a wee or a poo?</i>

458
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,589
I don't know, Harry,
the door's closed.

459
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:50,896
<i>Send him out on an errand for half an
hour, but don't make it sound suspicious.</i>

460
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,569
Ray? Why don't you go out down
to the pub for half an hour?

461
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,079
Yeah, yeah, I know
I said you couldn't,

462
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,878
but might as well
enjoy ourselves, eh?

463
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:12,116
No, I don't know if they've got
bowling anywhere. Could have a look.

464
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,747
Yeah, see you.

465
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,131
Yeah. He's gone.

466
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,468
<i>What'd you say to him?</i>

467
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,974
<i>I said, "Why don't you go have a
drink, you say you've been cooped up?"</i>

468
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,102
<i>What did he say?
Said, yeah, he would.</i>

469
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,703
And he might go have a look to see
if there's a bowling alley around.

470
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,408
<i>Was he just having a wee?</i>

471
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,313
Yeah, I think so.
I assume so.

472
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,442
<i>Sure he didn't mind?</i>

473
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,077
No, he was glad
to get out.

474
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,280
<i>He's definitely gone?</i>

475
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,788
Yeah, yeah,
he slammed the door.

476
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:49,121
<i>That don't mean he's gone.
Go check outside the door.</i>

477
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,807
Harry, he's definitely gone.

478
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,073
<i>You realize there are no
bowling alleys in Bruges?</i>

479
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,638
I realize that, Harry.
The boy wanted to have a look anyway.

480
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,083
<i>What are they gonna have, a
medieval fucking bowling alley?</i>

481
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,450
As I say, I think he was just
glad to get out and about.

482
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,513
<i>So, is he having a nice time,
seeing all the canals and that?</i>

483
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,752
<i>I had a lovely time
when I was there.</i>

484
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,352
<i>All the canals and the
old buildings and that.</i>

485
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:26,521
When were you here?

486
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:30,431
<i>When I was seven. Last
happy holiday I fucking had.</i>

487
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,563
<i>Have you been on a canal trip, yet?
- Yeah.</i>

488
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,832
<i>Have you been down, like, all
the old cobbled streets and that?</i>

489
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,964
Yeah.

490
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,236
<i>It's like a fairytale, isn't it, that place?
- Yeah.</i>

491
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,244
<i>With the churches and that. They're Gothic.
- Yeah.</i>

492
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,870
<i>Is it Gothic?
Yeah.</i>

493
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,507
<i>So he's having
a really nice time?</i>

494
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,416
Well, I'm having
a really nice time.

495
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,250
I'm not sure if it's
really his cup of tea.

496
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,117
<i>What?</i>

497
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,617
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

498
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,322
<i>What do you mean,
"It's not really his thing"?</i>

499
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,524
<i>What's that supposed to mean,
"It's not really his thing"?</i>

500
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,930
<i>What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?</i>

501
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,024
Nothing, Harry.

502
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,194
<i>It's a fairytale
fucking town, isn't it?</i>

503
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,034
<i>How can a fairytale town not
be somebody's fucking thing?</i>

504
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,234
<i>How can all those canals and bridges
and cobbled streets and those churches,</i>

505
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,573
<i>all that beautiful
fucking fairytale stuff,</i>

506
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,545
<i>how can that not be
somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

507
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,945
What I think
I meant to say was...

508
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,812
<i>Is the swan still there?
Yeah, the swan's...</i>

509
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,012
<i>How can fucking swans not fucking
be somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

510
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,213
<i>How can that be?</i>

511
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,414
What I think
I meant to say was,

512
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,652
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

513
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,719
You know, there's that big, dual
carriageway when you get off the train?

514
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,061
It mightn't have been here
when you were here last, Harry.

515
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,101
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

516
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:42,037
and he saw the canals and the bridges
and, you know, the swans and that,

517
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,040
well, he just
fucking loved it then.

518
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,635
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town.

519
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:52,341
It was just that initial, dual carriageway
thing sort of put him off for a second.

520
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,111
<i>Don't know if I remember
a dual carriageway.</i>

521
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,516
<i>Must be recent.</i>

522
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,951
<i>Hasn't spoilt it, has it?</i>

523
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,286
No, no, no, it's just
that initial thing.

524
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,455
And you know what?

525
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,823
As we were walking
through the streets,

526
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:13,063
there was this sort of freezing
fog hanging over everything,

527
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:17,304
and it made it look almost
like a fairytale or something.

528
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,898
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

529
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,534
<i>What'd he say?</i>

530
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:25,639
<i>He said, "Ken, I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream."</i>

531
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,082
<i>Yeah? He said that?</i>

532
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,176
Yeah.

533
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,813
<i>Meaning, like,
in a good dream?</i>

534
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,756
Yeah. Of course,
like in a good dream.

535
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,226
<i>Oh, good. I'm glad
he likes it there.</i>

536
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,263
<i>I'm glad we were able
to give him something.</i>

537
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,165
<i>Something good and happy. Because
he wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

538
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,695
Huh?

539
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,337
<i>He wasn't a bad kid,
was he?</i>

540
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,467
<i>Listen, take down this
address. Raamstraat 17.</i>

541
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,604
<i>That's "Raam," like "Ram,"
but with an extra "a."</i>

542
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,673
Raamstraat 17.

543
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,341
<i>You got that?</i>

544
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,151
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

545
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:06,451
<i>Good. There'll be a man there tomorrow
morning at 9:00, his name's Yuri.</i>

546
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,219
<i>Yuri.
He'll give you the gun.</i>

547
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,192
<i>Ring me on the public phone
at Jimmy Driscoll's</i>

548
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,094
<i>about 3:00 or 4:00 tomorrow,
after it's done.</i>

549
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,725
After what's done?

550
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,196
<i>Are you being thick?</i>

551
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,599
<i>No.
Listen, I like Ray.</i>

552
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,072
<i>He was a good bloke, but when it
all comes down to it, you know,</i>

553
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,235
<i>he blew the head off a little fucking kid.
And you brought him in, Ken.</i>

554
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,769
<i>So if the buck don't stop
with him, where does it stop?</i>

555
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,345
<i>Ken?</i>

556
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,888
<i>If the buck don't stop with
him, where does it stop?</i>

557
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,949
It stops with me, Harry.
That's an easy one.

558
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,154
<i>Look, don't get shirty, Ken.</i>

559
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:51,000
<i>Listen, I'm just glad that I was able to
do something for the boy before he went.</i>

560
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,695
Do what for the boy?

561
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,204
<i>You know, have him
get to see Bruges.</i>

562
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,203
<i>I'd like to go to see
Bruges again before I die.</i>

563
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,504
<i>What was it he said again
about... Yeah, "It's like a dream."</i>

564
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,547
<i>"I know I'm awake, but I
feel like I'm in a dream."</i>

565
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,113
<i>Yeah.</i>

566
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,289
<i>Give me a call
when he's dead.</i>

567
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,785
That's my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole.

568
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,082
Eirik, what are you doing?

569
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,918
Where are you from, fucker?

570
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,458
Ireland, originally.

571
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,523
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium

572
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,358
and fuck another man's girl?

573
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,261
Look, I didn't know she
had a boyfriend, all right?

574
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,301
And I haven't fucked her, anyway.
Ask her. I'd only put me hand on it.

575
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,337
Eirik, put the gun down!

576
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,972
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

577
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,599
Don't start being silly.

578
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,439
Get down on your...

579
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,940
Exactly at what point was it that
all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

580
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,176
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,

581
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,514
you just went around beating
up Pakistani 12-year-olds.

582
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,885
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

583
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,618
That's not gonna
help you, man.

584
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,456
Ray, there's only
blanks in that gun.

585
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,832
Eirik, don't!

586
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,200
Now who's the
fucking bum-boy?

587
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,501
You, you fucking bum-boy!

588
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,507
Chloe, what exactly
is going on here?

589
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,738
I can't see!
I can't see!

590
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:47,216
Of course you can't fucking see! I
just shot a blank in your fucking eyes!

591
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:52,221
Is this fella your boyfriend?
No. I mean, he used to be.

592
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,449
Well, what's he doing here?

593
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,960
We... We rob tourists,
sometimes.

594
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,962
I fucking knew it was
too good to be true!

595
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,093
I knew you'd have never
shagged me, normally.

596
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,396
No! That's not true, I...

597
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,835
I called it off tonight. I
told him not to come tonight.

598
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,031
Why did you come tonight?

599
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,801
Chloe,
I can't see, I swear it!

600
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,365
Stop whingeing
like a big gay baby.

601
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,002
I haven't had
a shag in months!

602
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:20,073
I can't see out of this eye,
Chloe! I have to go to the hospital!

603
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,879
I'll drive you.

604
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,715
Great! Now the whole
night's ruined!

605
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,049
No!

606
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:29,081
You can stay if you want.
I just don't know how long I'll be.

607
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,026
I just knew someone like you
would never like someone like me.

608
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,860
I just knew.
What do you mean, someone like me?

609
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,900
You know, someone nice.

610
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,765
Call me. Please.

611
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,311
Chloe!

612
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,279
Cha-ching!

613
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:05,554
Have you got some
sort of problem?

614
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,590
No, no problem.

615
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,388
Four beers in 20 minutes.
No problem.

616
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,591
Fuck off.

617
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:23,832
Beer and a red wine.

618
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,374
I'll be back.

619
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,742
How's the movie going?

620
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:33,977
It's a jumped-up Eurotrash piece
of rip-off fucking bullshit.

621
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,985
Like, in a bad way?

622
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,184
Your girlfriend's
very pretty.

623
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:45,058
She ain't my girlfriend.
She's a prostitute I just picked up.

624
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,621
Didn't know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges.

625
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,100
You just have to look
in the right places.

626
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,830
Brothels are good.

627
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,364
Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

628
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,807
Thank you.

629
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,044
You from the States?

630
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,010
Yeah.

631
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,852
But don't hold it
against me.

632
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,285
I'll try not to.

633
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,849
Just try not to say
anything too loud or crass.

634
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,943
Hey-ho. Drowning
your sorrows, huh?

635
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:39,744
What sorrows?
- You know, being a sad, old, ugly little man.

636
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,010
One gay beer, please.

637
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,210
How'd your date go?

638
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,516
My date involved two
instances of extreme violence.

639
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,613
One instance of her hand on my
cock and my finger up her thing,

640
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,591
which lasted all too briefly.
Isn't that always the way?

641
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,061
One instance of me stealing five
grams of her very-high-quality cocaine,

642
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,291
and one instance of me blinding
a poofy little skinhead.

643
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,562
So, all in all, my evening
pretty much balanced out fine.

644
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,728
You got five grams of coke?

645
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,200
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

646
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,570
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

647
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:05,869
as if I'm about to
have a heart attack.

648
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,138
So if I collapse any minute now,
please remember to tell the doctors

649
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,838
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

650
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,346
Give us a gram, then.

651
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,383
I thought you were laying off,
because it makes you depressed?

652
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,851
You know what? Right now,
I don't really give a fuck.

653
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,176
Why didn't you wave hello to me
today when I waved hello to you today?

654
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,811
I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today.

655
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:55,790
I wasn't waving hello to
anybody, except maybe to a horse.

656
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,693
Huh? What are you
talking about?

657
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,821
Just horseshit.

658
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,561
You from America?

659
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,193
Yeah. But don't
hold it against me.

660
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:09,204
Well, that's for me
to decide, isn't it?

661
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,705
Are you from America, too?

662
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,298
No, I'm from Amsterdam.

663
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,775
Amsterdam.

664
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,677
Amsterdam is just a load of
bloody prostitutes, isn't it?

665
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,738
Yes. That's why
I came to Bruges.

666
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:22,080
I thought I'd get a better
price for my pussy here.

667
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,843
Huh?

668
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,117
You two are weird.

669
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,354
Would you like some cocaine?

670
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,696
I've also got some
acid and some ecstasy.

671
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,036
Herv Villechaize,
I know, did.

672
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,878
<i>The dwarf off, I think,
The Time Bandits, did.</i>

673
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,779
Lots of midgets...

674
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,879
Dwarves, top themselves.

675
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,086
Hmm. Shitloads.

676
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,293
Would you ever
think about it?

677
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,719
Huh?

678
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,432
Would you ever think about killing
yourself because you're a midget?

679
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,561
Fuck, man!
What kind of question is that?

680
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,196
We're just chatting,
aren't we?

681
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,007
See, Ken, this is the kind of hotel
Harry should have put us in.

682
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,517
A five-star,
with prostitutes in.

683
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:33,782
You know, sometimes, I think Harry
doesn't even give a shit about us at all.

684
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,226
Has he still not called?

685
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,656
No. Still hasn't called.

686
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,322
No news is good news, eh?

687
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,697
Hmm.

688
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,241
Who's she?

689
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,241
There's gonna be
a war, man.

690
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,448
I can see it.

691
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,511
There's gonna be a war between
the blacks and between the whites.

692
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,057
You ain't even gonna need
a uniform no more.

693
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,787
This ain't gonna be a war
where you pick your side.

694
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,294
Your side's already
picked for you.

695
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:15,388
And I know whose side I'm fighting on.
I'm fighting with the blacks.

696
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,126
The whites are gonna get
their heads kicked in!

697
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,430
You don't decide
this shit, man.

698
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,403
Well, who are the
half-castes gonna fight with?

699
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,133
The blacks, man.
That's obvious.

700
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,641
But what about
the Pakistanis?

701
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,339
The blacks.
What about...

702
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,872
Think of a hard one.

703
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,909
What about the Vietnamese?

704
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,453
The blacks!

705
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:42,083
Well, I'm definitely fighting with the
blacks if they've got the Vietnamese.

706
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,595
So, hang on.

707
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,261
Would all of the white midgets
in the world be fighting

708
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,766
against all the black
midgets in the world?

709
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,598
Yeah.

710
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,431
That would make a good film!

711
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:02,040
You don't know how much shit I've
had to take off of black midgets, man.

712
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:03,876
That's...

713
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,211
Undeniably true.

714
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:08,751
See, Jimmy,

715
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:11,914
my wife was black.

716
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,548
And I loved her very much.

717
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:21,654
And in 1976, she was
murdered by a white man.

718
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:27,530
So, where the fuck am I supposed to
stand in all this blood and carnage?

719
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,471
Did they get
the guy who did it?

720
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,000
A friend of mine got him.

721
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,101
Harry Waters got him.

722
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,515
So tell me, Jim, whose side do
I fight on in this wonderful war?

723
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,648
I think you need to
weigh up all your options

724
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,283
and let your
conscience decide, Ken.

725
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:04,633
Two manky hookers
and a racist dwarf.

726
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,335
I think I'm heading home.

727
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,843
Yeah. I think
I'll come with you.

728
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,672
What's...
Back off, shorty!

729
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,650
You don't know karate.

730
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,708
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

731
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,583
Don't say you didn't
have it coming.

732
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,219
Shortarse!

733
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,437
Meeting Yuri.

734
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,603
Yes, I'm Yuri.

735
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,972
Mr. Waters said
that might be necessary.

736
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,673
There are a lot of alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park.

737
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,781
<i>You use this word,
"alcoves"?</i>

738
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,819
<i>"Alcoves"? Yes. Sometimes.</i>

739
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:39,055
There are not many people around
in these alcoves in Christmastime.

740
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,929
If I were to murder a man,
I would murder him here.

741
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:48,637
<i>Are you sure this is
the right word, "alcoves"?</i>

742
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:52,368
<i>"Alcoves," yes. It's kind
of like "nooks and crannies."</i>

743
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:56,538
<i>"Nooks and crannies," yes.
Perhaps this would be more accurate.</i>

744
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,014
<i>"Nooks and crannies,"
rather than "alcoves." Yeah.</i>

745
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,793
You are going to do it, aren't you?
Mr. Waters will be very disappointed...

746
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,454
Of course I'm going to
fucking do it.

747
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,556
It's what I do.

748
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,104
Your friend was behaving
rather oddly this morning.

749
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,107
Oddly? How?

750
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:39,315
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

751
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:43,557
I said I didn't mind as long
as it's healthy, of course.

752
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,960
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

753
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:54,369
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

754
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,266
Would you give it back
to him when you see him?

755
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,036
I don't want to appear ungrateful, but
it seemed like all the money he had.

756
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:08,106
Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park.

757
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,075
Sorry, Ray.

758
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,345
I'm sorry.

759
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,240
Ray, don't!

760
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,908
Fucking hell!
Where the fuck did you come from?

761
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,975
I was behind the thing. What
the fuck are you doing, Ray?

762
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,543
What the fuck
are you doing?

763
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:52,679
Nothing.

764
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,290
Oh, my God!

765
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,888
You were gonna kill me.
No, I wasn't.

766
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,558
You were gonna
kill yourself!

767
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:07,633
I'm allowed to.

768
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:08,728
No, you're not!

769
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:09,931
What?

770
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:13,441
I'm not allowed to and you are?
How's that fair?

771
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,780
Can we go somewhere
and talk about this, please?

772
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,185
I wasn't gonna go
through with it, Ray.

773
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:33,319
You fucking looked like you were
gonna go fucking through with it.

774
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,060
Where'd you get that gun?

775
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,725
A friend of Harry's.

776
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,132
Fuck, man.

777
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,262
Let me see it.

778
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:49,767
Silencer, too.

779
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,407
Nice.

780
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,286
Mine's a bloody girl's gun.

781
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,924
I'm keeping it.
Pardon me?

782
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,468
Give me me gun back.
You're not getting it back.

783
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,666
You're a suicide case.

784
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,471
And you were trying to
shoot me in the fucking head.

785
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:23,102
You're not getting
that gun back.

786
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:26,012
A great day this has
turned out to be.

787
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,051
I'm suicidal, me
mate tries to kill me,

788
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:32,747
me gun gets nicked and we're
still in fucking Bruges.

789
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:38,357
Listen, I'm gonna give you some money
and put you on a train somewhere.

790
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:39,793
Back to England?

791
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,888
You can't go back to England, Ray.
You'd be a dead man!

792
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,024
I want
to be a dead man.

793
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,762
Have you been
missing something?

794
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:50,769
You don't want to be
a dead man, Ray.

795
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,474
I killed a little boy!

796
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,789
Then save the
next little boy.

797
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,287
Just go away somewhere,

798
01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:19,468
get out of this business
and try to do something good.

799
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,061
You're not gonna
help anybody dead.

800
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,233
You're not gonna
bring that boy back.

801
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,676
But you might save
the next one.

802
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,411
What am I gonna be,
a doctor?

803
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,676
You need exams.

804
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:40,115
Do anything, Ray.
Do anything.

805
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,162
What a wanker!

806
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,167
He said this whole trip,

807
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,647
this whole being
in Bruges thing,

808
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:11,216
was just to give you one last,
joyful memory before you died.

809
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,053
In Bruges?

810
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:21,491
The Bahamas, maybe.

811
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,195
Why fucking Bruges?

812
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,802
I suppose it's cheaper.

813
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,104
The rest of the acid
and the ecstasy.

814
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,479
Can I have me gun
back, please?

815
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,456
What am I gonna do, Ken?

816
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,220
What am I gonna do?
Just keep moving.

817
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,262
Keep on moving.

818
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,389
Try not to think about it.

819
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,100
Learn a new language, maybe?

820
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,159
Sure, I can
hardly do English.

821
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,465
That's one thing
I like about Europe, though.

822
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,631
You don't have to learn
any of their languages.

823
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:07,403
Just forget about
home for a while.

824
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:10,934
See how the land lies
in six years, seven years.

825
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:13,208
Seven years is not that long.

826
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,976
It's longer than
that boy got.

827
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,543
Me first fucking job.

828
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:22,221
Great hitman
I turned out to be.

829
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,997
Some people just aren't
cut out for it, Ray.

830
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:30,860
Are you?

831
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,664
When are you
going back to England?

832
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,502
I'll head back in a couple
of hours or something.

833
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:46,207
Harry's not gonna be mad at you, is he?
For letting me go?

834
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:47,873
I'll sort out Harry.

835
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:51,147
Just tell him I'll have probably
killed meself in a fortnight, anyway.

836
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,211
You won't, will you, Ray?

837
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:15,075
Harry? It's Ken.

838
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,736
Listen to this noise.

839
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:21,345
Do you know what that is?

840
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:25,319
Yeah, I know you know it's a train.
Do you know what train?

841
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:28,789
Well, it's a train that Ray just
got on, and he's alive and he's well,

842
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:31,258
and he doesn't know where
he's going and neither do I.

843
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:34,160
So if you need to do
your worst, do your worst.

844
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,461
You've got the address of the
hotel. I'll be here waiting.

845
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:40,593
Because I've got to quite
like Bruges, now.

846
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,661
It's like a fucking
fairytale or something.

847
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:13,529
Harry.

848
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,497
Harry!

849
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,130
What?

850
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,265
It's an inanimate
fucking object.

851
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,833
You're an inanimate
fucking object!

852
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,785
Now, you lot be good for
your mummy and Imamoto, okay?

853
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,848
'Cause Daddy's got to
go away for a few days.

854
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:37,915
Where are you going?

855
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,586
I've got to go to Bruges.

856
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,254
Bruges? Where's that?

857
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,388
It's in Belgium.

858
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,166
Why would anybody
have to go to Belgium?

859
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,931
'Cause I've got to
sort something out.

860
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,439
Is it something
to do with the phone?

861
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,270
It's something
to do with Ken.

862
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,808
It's a matter of honor.

863
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,744
Well, it ain't gonna
be dangerous, is it?

864
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,985
Well, of course it's gonna be dangerous
if it's a matter of fucking honor!

865
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,546
You are bringing
the fellas with you?

866
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:11,491
Tell me you're bringing
the fellas with you.

867
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,256
Harry.

868
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:16,729
I'm sorry for calling you
an inanimate object.

869
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,198
I was upset.

870
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,535
You're Irish?
Yes.

871
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,665
What is your name?

872
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,934
Derek Perlurrl.

873
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,543
You hit the Canadian.

874
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,081
You hit the Canadian.

875
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:20,111
<i>I "heet" the Canadian? I don't
know what you're talking about.</i>

876
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,350
That's him!
That's the motherfucker.

877
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,727
You hit the Canadian, yeah?

878
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,898
Canadian? Shit.

879
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:46,380
We're taking you back to Bruges.
Brilliant.

880
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,237
Aye aye.

881
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:18,405
Take your pick,
Mr. Waters.

882
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,651
An Uzi?

883
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,586
I'm not from South Central
Los fucking Angeles.

884
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:30,386
I didn't come here to shoot 20 black
10-year-olds in a fucking drive-by.

885
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:33,189
I want a normal gun
for a normal person.

886
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:47,139
I knew he wouldn't
kill the guy.

887
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:51,373
I could see it in his eyes when I
was telling him about the alcoves.

888
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,173
About the what?
The alcoves.

889
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,014
The alcoves in the
Koningin Astrid Park.

890
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,885
Oh, I also have
some dumdums.

891
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:05,415
<i>You use this word, "dumdums"? The
bullets that make the head explode?</i>

892
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:06,859
Dumdums, yeah.

893
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,523
Would you like some
of these dumdums?

894
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,795
I know I shouldn't,

895
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,800
but I will.

896
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,275
Motherfucker.

897
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:23,602
Is he talking to me?

898
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,840
No, Eirik's on your
side, Mr. Waters.

899
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,939
Your young friend
blinded him last night.

900
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,075
Ray did?

901
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:32,450
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me.

902
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:36,088
And the gun
was full of blanks,

903
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,785
and he shot the blank
into my eye.

904
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:43,456
And now, I cannot see from this
eye ever again, the doctors say.

905
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,499
Well, to be honest, it sounds
like it was all your fault.

906
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:48,593
What?

907
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:51,469
I mean, basically, if you're robbing
a man and you're only carrying blanks,

908
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,474
and you allow your gun
to be taken off you,

909
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,772
and you allow yourself to be
shot in the eye with a blank,

910
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:59,405
for which I assume the person has
to get quite close to you, then,

911
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,746
yeah, really, it's all your
fault for being such a poof.

912
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,753
So why don't you stop
whingeing and cheer the fuck up?

913
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,381
Eirik, I really
wouldn't respond.

914
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:16,725
I thought you wanted
the guy dead?

915
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,926
I do want the guy dead.
I want him fucking crucified.

916
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,300
But it don't change the fact that he
stitched you up like a blind, little gay boy.

917
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:23,395
Does it?

918
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,332
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

919
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:35,435
Well?

920
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,513
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

921
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,572
He's a walking dead man.

922
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,409
Keeps going on
about Hell and purgatory...

923
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:46,886
When I phoned you
yesterday, did I ask you,

924
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:50,516
<i>"Ken, will you do me a favor and
become Ray's psychiatrist, please?"</i>

925
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:55,086
<i>No. What I think I asked you was, "Could
you go blow his fucking head off for me?"</i>

926
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,155
<i>"He's suicidal"?</i>

927
01:13:57,232 --> 01:14:00,724
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

928
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,998
We don't all keep
going on about it!

929
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:07,440
Has he killed himself yet?
No. So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?

930
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:09,909
He put a loaded gun to his head this morning.
I stopped him.

931
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:12,503
He... What?
This gets fucking worse!

932
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,507
We were down in the park...

933
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:18,542
Let me get this right.
You were down in the park?

934
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,747
What's that got to do
with fucking anything?

935
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:23,690
Let me get this right.
Not only have you refused to kill the boy,

936
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,954
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

937
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,290
which would have
solved my problem,

938
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:28,624
which would have
solved your problem,

939
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:30,597
which sounds like it would've
solved the boy's problem.

940
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,293
It wouldn't have
solved his problem.

941
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:36,326
Ken, if I had killed a little
kid, accidentally or otherwise,

942
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:37,633
I wouldn't have
thought twice.

943
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,231
I'd have killed myself on the fucking spot.
On the fucking spot.

944
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,971
I'd have stuck the gun in
me mouth on the fucking spot!

945
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,674
That's you, Harry.
The boy has the capacity to change.

946
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,216
The boy has the capacity to do
something decent with his life.

947
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:52,720
Excuse me, Ken. I have
the capacity to change.

948
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,050
Yeah, you do. You've the
capacity to get fucking worse!

949
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,150
Yeah, now I'm
getting down to it!

950
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:02,129
Harry, let's face it.

951
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,893
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

952
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,400
but you're a cunt.

953
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:09,301
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt.

954
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:13,102
And the only thing that's gonna change is
you're gonna become an even bigger cunt.

955
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,665
Maybe have some
more cunt kids.

956
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:16,836
Leave my kids fucking out of it.
What have they done?

957
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,346
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

958
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,678
I retract that bit about
your cunt fucking kids.

959
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:25,447
Insulting my fucking kids!
That's going overboard, mate!

960
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,512
I retracted it, didn't I?

961
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:31,750
Still leaves you
being a cunt.

962
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:34,387
Yeah, I fucking got that.

963
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,575
Where's Ray now?

964
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,546
Oh, right about now,
Ray is in one or other

965
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:04,183
of the one million towns in mainland Europe
it's possible to be in, other than here.

966
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:20,540
I'll get all the money back to you
soon as I get through to me friend.

967
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:22,201
It's not a problem,
Raymond.

968
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,939
And I'll get all your acid and
your ecstasy back to you, too.

969
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,537
English humor!

970
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:29,345
I'm assuming you've
got your gun on you.

971
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:34,522
That Yuri bloke's
a funny fella, isn't he?

972
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,750
He does yoga.

973
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,353
<i>"The alcoves."</i>

974
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,759
Was he going on
to you about the alcoves?

975
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,964
<i>"The alcoves
in the Koningin Astrid Park."</i>

976
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,867
Harry, I know you gotta do
what you gotta do.

977
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,810
It's a bit crowded
round here, you know?

978
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,177
Well, I'm not gonna
have a shootout

979
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,739
in the middle of a thousand
fucking Belgians, am I?

980
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:08,378
Not to mention the other
nationalities, just on their holidays.

981
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,446
Hmm.

982
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:13,058
To see the swans and the Gothic
and all the fairytale stuff, eh?

983
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,495
Are you trying to fucking wind me up?
- No, Harry.

984
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:18,965
On top of calling me a cunt
and calling me kids cunts.

985
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:22,003
I might just have to
fucking shoot you right here.

986
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,298
Christ!

987
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,701
Let's go up the bell tower.

988
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,973
Be quiet up there
this time of evening.

989
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,708
Let's go up there.

990
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,129
Yeah. Canadians.

991
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:59,134
I feel a bit bad.
They didn't kill John Lennon, did they?

992
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,675
Anyway, supposed to turn up
to court here in two days.

993
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:02,767
Are you going to turn up?

994
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:03,868
Don't know.

995
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:06,175
What have I got to
stay for really?

996
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:11,245
The most beautiful woman

997
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:14,581
you've ever seen

998
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,017
in all of your stupid life.

999
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:30,503
The tower is closed
this evening.

1000
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:32,767
No way. It's supposed
to be open till 7:00.

1001
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:34,934
The tower is usually
open until 7:00.

1002
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,740
Yesterday an American had
a heart attack up the tower.

1003
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,212
Today the tower is closed.

1004
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:43,274
Here, cranky, here's 100 for you.
We're only gonna be 20 minutes.

1005
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:54,588
The tower is closed
this evening.

1006
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,995
Understand, Englishman?

1007
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,295
Jimmy, I've been
wanting to say

1008
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:41,638
I'm really sorry for
karate-chopping you the other night.

1009
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,076
That was way out of order.

1010
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:48,776
You know, Ray, I'd find it easier
to believe and forgive you, somehow,

1011
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:53,947
if the two of you weren't laughing
straight in my fucking face!

1012
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:58,990
It's for the
goddamn movie, man.

1013
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,656
It is a nice town, Harry.

1014
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,292
I'm glad I got to see it.

1015
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:16,637
I didn't mean to be taking the piss
out of it being a fairytale place.

1016
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,542
It is a fairytale place.

1017
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:20,976
It really is.
Hmm.

1018
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,877
It's just a shame
it's in Belgium, really.

1019
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:26,318
But then you figure if it wasn't in
Belgium, if it was somewhere good,

1020
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:30,518
there'd be too many people coming to
see it. It would spoil the whole thing.

1021
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,291
Well, I'm glad
I got to see it

1022
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,622
before I died.

1023
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,503
What are you doing?

1024
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,943
What are you
fucking doing?

1025
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,842
I'm not fighting
anymore, Harry.

1026
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:55,978
All right, then I'm blowing
your fucking head off.

1027
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,311
Don't come over all Gandhi.
What are you fucking doing?

1028
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,986
Ken, stop messing
about, please.

1029
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,119
Pick up your gun. I know
I'm going to beat you anyway

1030
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,823
'cause you're a spaz, but...
Harry,

1031
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,391
I'm totally in your debt.

1032
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:19,466
The things that have
gone between us in the past,

1033
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:21,972
I love you unreservedly
for all that.

1034
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:23,203
What?

1035
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:25,908
For your integrity.

1036
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,440
For your honor.

1037
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,750
I love you.

1038
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,554
The boy had to be let go.

1039
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,359
The boy had to be
given a chance.

1040
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:46,323
<i>And if to do that, I had to say,
"Fuck you, and fuck what I owe you,</i>

1041
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:51,134
<i>"and fuck everything that's gone on
between us," then that's what I had to do.</i>

1042
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:53,597
But I'm not fighting you.

1043
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:57,236
And I accept, totally,
everything you've got to do.

1044
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,143
I accept it. Totally.

1045
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:04,246
Oh, yeah?

1046
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:07,646
Yeah.

1047
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:17,290
Well, you say all that fucking stuff,
I can't fucking shoot you now, can I?

1048
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,158
It's entirely
up to you, Harry.

1049
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:23,227
It's entirely your call.

1050
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,639
All I'm saying is
I'm not fighting.

1051
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,642
Oh, you fucking cunt!

1052
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:37,946
Look, I'm not gonna
do nothing to you

1053
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:41,819
just 'cause you're standing
about like Robert fucking Powell.

1054
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:44,352
Like who?
Like Robert fucking Powell

1055
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,257
<i>out of Jesus of
fucking Nazareth!</i>

1056
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:47,488
My fucking leg!

1057
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:52,022
The psycho dwarf turns out to just
be a loveable little schoolboy,

1058
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,625
and it's all some kind of
Boschian nightmare.

1059
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,193
Kiss my ass!

1060
01:22:56,271 --> 01:23:00,435
I guess at least there weren't any
black people involved, eh, Jimmy?

1061
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,075
I wasn't...

1062
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:05,937
I wasn't talking about...

1063
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:10,141
There's gonna be a war between
all the blacks and all the whites.

1064
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:12,015
And all the black midgets
and all the white midgets,

1065
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:14,248
which would actually
be really good.

1066
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:16,085
That's just cocaine.

1067
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,591
He didn't even want
the Vietnamese on his side!

1068
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,787
That's just cocaine.

1069
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:25,460
Listen, we're filming down by
the pointy building tonight.

1070
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:28,024
It might actually be
good for once.

1071
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,464
You guys should come along.

1072
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:36,272
We... I think we're just gonna
have a quiet one tonight, Jimmy.

1073
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,940
That's how it is!

1074
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,542
In another life.

1075
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,451
They're great,
aren't they?

1076
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:10,100
You didn't. You didn't!

1077
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:01,318
Mr. Waters? Mr. Waters?

1078
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:06,289
Who's that?
It's Eirik.

1079
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,703
The blind boy?
Yeah.

1080
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:12,366
Yes.

1081
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,538
What do you fucking want?

1082
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,134
The guy you're looking for,

1083
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:20,306
the guy Ray, he's
downstairs at the bar.

1084
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:58,176
I'm sorry, Ken.

1085
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:02,915
But you can't kill a kid and
expect to get away with it.

1086
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:06,417
You just can't.

1087
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:24,404
Where?
To the left when you come out.

1088
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,276
The bar to the left.

1089
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:44,740
Ken!

1090
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,382
Ken! Ken!

1091
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,876
Harry's here.

1092
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:56,181
What?

1093
01:29:57,658 --> 01:29:58,852
Take

1094
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:01,790
my gun.

1095
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:16,302
Ken?

1096
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:18,936
Where's my gun?

1097
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,507
Where's my gun?

1098
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:28,649
I'm gonna die now, I think.

1099
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:32,024
Oh, Ken!

1100
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:35,155
Jesus!

1101
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:44,357
Mr. Blakely said
you had left.

1102
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:45,687
I need the key
to the room right now.

1103
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,284
Quickly, now!

1104
01:32:48,162 --> 01:32:50,357
And you gotta go home right now.
It's very, very dangerous here.

1105
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:51,708
All right? Go home! Right now!

1106
01:32:51,709 --> 01:32:51,921
Okay.

1107
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:40,875
No, I won't let you up
there! Put that gun away, right now!

1108
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:42,643
Lady, get out of
my fucking way, please.

1109
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:45,811
No, I won't. I won't
get out of your way.

1110
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:48,177
You'll have to
go through me.

1111
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:51,088
Well, obviously, I'm not gonna through
you, am I, with a baby and that?

1112
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:52,182
I'm a nice person.

1113
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:54,989
But could you just get out
of the fucking way, please?

1114
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:01,494
Marie!

1115
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,802
Just let him
come up, it's okay.

1116
01:34:04,872 --> 01:34:08,171
Harry, swear not to start shooting
until she's left the hotel.

1117
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:11,643
I swear not to start shooting till
she's left the hotel. I totally swear.

1118
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,180
Well, I'm not
going anywhere.

1119
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,409
This is my hotel.

1120
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,247
So you can fuck off!

1121
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:33,485
I suppose you've
got a gun up there?

1122
01:34:33,486 --> 01:34:33,765
Yeah.

1123
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:37,699
Then what are we gonna do?
We can't stand here all night.

1124
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:40,832
Why don't you both put
your guns down and go home?

1125
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:43,968
Don't be stupid.
This is the shootout.

1126
01:34:45,646 --> 01:34:48,740
Harry, I've got an idea.
What?

1127
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:51,046
My room faces
onto the canal, right?

1128
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:53,814
I'm gonna go back to me room,
jump into the canal,

1129
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:55,981
see if I can swim to the
other side and escape.

1130
01:34:56,057 --> 01:34:58,287
Right. If you go outside
and round the corner,

1131
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:00,725
you can shoot at me from
there and try and get me.

1132
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:03,263
That way, we leave this lady and her
baby out of the whole, entire thing.

1133
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:05,662
Do you completely promise
to jump into the canal?

1134
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:07,530
I don't want to run out
there, come back in 10 minutes

1135
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:09,159
and find you fucking
hiding in a cupboard.

1136
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:10,533
I completely promise, Harry.

1137
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:12,936
I'm not gonna risk having
another little kid die, am I?

1138
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:17,171
So, hang on, I go outside, then
I go which way, right or left?

1139
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:18,711
You go right,
don't you?

1140
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:21,771
You can see it from the doorway!
It's a big fucking canal!

1141
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:24,818
All right. Jesus! I've only
just got here, haven't I?

1142
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,718
<i>Okay. On a count of
"one, two, three, go," okay?</i>

1143
01:35:27,788 --> 01:35:28,948
Okay.

1144
01:35:34,862 --> 01:35:36,159
What? Who says it?

1145
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,629
Oh, you say it.

1146
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:39,632
You guys are crazy.

1147
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,099
Are you ready?
Ready.

1148
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:42,692
Set?
Set.

1149
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,567
One, two, three, go!

1150
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,119
Keep driving!

1151
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:09,527
No way. You're way
too far away.

1152
01:38:12,253 --> 01:38:14,050
The little boy.

1153
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:15,179
That's right, Ray.

1154
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:17,881
The little boy.

1155
01:39:23,691 --> 01:39:24,680
Oh.

1156
01:39:26,927 --> 01:39:28,121
I see.

1157
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:36,395
No, Harry.

1158
01:39:37,404 --> 01:39:38,928
He's not...

1159
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:44,203
You've got to stick
to your principles.

1160
01:40:10,604 --> 01:40:12,367
<i>There's a Christmas tree
somewhere in London</i>

1161
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:16,341
<i>with a bunch of presents underneath
it that'll never be opened.</i>

1162
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:20,970
<i>And I thought, "If I survive
all this, I'll go to that house,</i>

1163
01:40:21,048 --> 01:40:22,811
<i>"apologize to
the mother there,</i>

1164
01:40:22,883 --> 01:40:26,319
<i>"and accept whatever
punishment she chose for me."</i>

1165
01:40:26,387 --> 01:40:29,754
<i>Prison, death,
it didn't matter.</i>

1166
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:34,390
<i>Because at least in prison and
at least in death, you know,</i>

1167
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:36,827
<i>I wouldn't be
in fucking Bruges.</i>

1168
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:43,360
<i>But then, like a flash,
it came to me, and I realized,</i>

1169
01:40:45,672 --> 01:40:48,300
<i>"Fuck, man, maybe
that's what Hell is.</i>

1170
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:53,209
<i>"The entire rest of eternity
spent in fucking Bruges!"</i>

1171
01:40:58,085 --> 01:41:00,918
<i>And I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

1172
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:06,007
<i>I really, really
hoped I wouldn't die.</i>

1173
