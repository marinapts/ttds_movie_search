1
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,682
<i>Mom!</i>

2
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:54,227
<i>Mom! Help me.</i>

3
00:00:57,398 --> 00:00:58,398
What is it?

4
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:01,317
I wasn't dreaming, Walt.
I didn't imagine it.

5
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:04,571
I heard him. I heard him. I heard him.
I heard Chris.

6
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:07,448
- I heard him!
- I know.

7
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:10,159
No. I wasn't imagining it, Walt.

8
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:13,121
No, I did. He's... He's...

9
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,541
- I heard him!
- Billie.

10
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:45,525
That's about as far as I can get you.

11
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,235
All right. Thank you.

12
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:04,502
- You left all your shit on my dash.
- Keep it.

13
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,005
Suit yourself.

14
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,048
Thanks again.

15
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,886
Hey, hold on a minute.

16
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:20,061
Here, take these.
They'll keep your feet dry.

17
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:25,358
If you make it out alive, give me a call.
My number's inside the boots.

18
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:26,860
Thanks.

19
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:05,851
Hello?

20
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:15,087
Is there anybody here?

21
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,466
Guess not!

22
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,289
Two years he walks the earth.

23
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,840
No phone, no pool, no pets,

24
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,468
<i>no cigarettes.</i>

25
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:01,612
Ultimate freedom.

26
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:07,534
An extremist. An aesthetic voyager

27
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:13,499
whose home is the road.

28
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,836
"Hey, listen, old man.
Now, don't psychoanalyze me, all right?

29
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,839
"Shut up.
I'm taking you out to where we're going."

30
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:22,508
"Where you going?"

31
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,344
"I told you. We're going nowhere!"

32
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:33,519
So now, after two rambling years
comes the final and greatest adventure.

33
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:38,357
The climactic battle to kill

34
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,694
the false being within

35
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:46,740
and victoriously conclude
the spiritual revolution.

36
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:21,066
No longer to be poisoned
by civilization, he flees,

37
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,695
and walks alone
upon the land to become

38
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,698
lost in the wild.

39
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:04,278
<i>... hard work and manifold contributions
to our community during their time here,</i>

40
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:08,574

41
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,786

<i>Christopher Johnson McCandless.</i>

45

<i>Regina Victoria McNabb.</i>

46
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,519
<i>I see them standing at the formal gates
of their colleges.</i>

47
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,734
<i>I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch,</i>

48
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:30,281
<i>the red tiles glinting like bent plates
of blood behind his head.</i>

49
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,993
<i>I see my mother
with a few light books at her hip,</i>

50
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:37,705
<i>standing at the pillar made of tiny
bricks with the wrought-iron gates</i>

51
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,876
<i>still open behind her,
its sword-tips black in the May air.</i>

52
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:44,962
<i>They are about to graduate.</i>

53
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:50,926
<i>They are about to get married.
They are kids. They are dumb.</i>

54
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:55,556
<i>All they know is they are innocent,
they would never hurt anybody.</i>

55
00:15:57,811 --> 00:16:01,522
<i>I want to go up to them and say,
"Stop, don't do it.</i>

56
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:05,359
<i>"She's the wrong woman,
he's the wrong man.</i>

57
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:09,739
<i>"You are going to do things
you cannot imagine you would ever do.</i>

58
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:12,992
<i>"You are going to do bad things
to children.</i>

59
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:15,661
<i>"You are going to suffer
in ways you never heard of.</i>

60
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:17,747
<i>"You are going to want to die."</i>

61
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,253
<i>I want to go up to them there
in the late May sunlight and say it.</i>

62
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:27,632
<i>But I don't do it. I want to live.</i>

63
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:33,679
<i>I take them up like the male and female
paper dolls, and bang them together</i>

64
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:38,768
<i>at the hips like chips of flint, as if
to strike sparks from them. I say,</i>

65
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,815
"Do what you are going to do
and I will tell about it."

66
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:48,569
Here they are, Walt. Okay?

67
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,197
Who wrote that?

68
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:56,202
Well, could have been either one of us,
couldn't it?

69
00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:58,996
Why is he letting Carine drive his car?

70
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,416
There's a lot of great poems in here.

71
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,507
I have to speak to her about it.

72
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:10,633
Sit down.

73
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,386
Excuse me. I'm going to get my son.

74
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,639
He just graduated today
from Emory College.

75
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:18,015
I'll get it. I'll get it.

76
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,686
Chris, hi!
We've been waiting and waiting.

77
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,148
You scared me half to death
jumping up there on that stage like that.

78
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,652
- Hi, Dad.
- Congratulations, Son.

79
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:33,155
- This is a big step.
- Thank you, Dad.

80
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:34,991
All right.

81
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:38,244
You're not supposed to be driving
in Georgia.

82
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:39,453
Why? I have my permit.

83
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:41,747
'Cause it's against the law
for a learner's permit

84
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:45,251
to drive in another state
from one's home state. That's why.

85
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:48,754
I didn't know that. I thought that if I was
with a legal driver that it'd be okay.

86
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,839
Well, let's...

87
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:02,560
- Are they going to continue?
- No.

88
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,523
I guess everybody's celebrating today.

89
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,569
- They're going to stay in the bar, right?
- That's right.

90
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:26,628
My grades are good enough, I think,
to get into Harvard Law.

91
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:28,671
Chris, that's wonderful.

92
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:32,216
That is a big deal.

93
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:35,595
How much do you have left
in the college fund?

94
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:41,142
Exactly $24,500.68.

95
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:42,894
Well, that's specific.

96
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:45,730
I had to go to the bank
this morning, Mom.

97
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:51,569
Your mother and I will be glad
to contribute the balance for Harvard.

98
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:53,112
That's right.

99
00:18:53,405 --> 00:18:54,739
I've got to figure out
what I'm going to do.

100
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:58,284
I've got a lot of things
to pack and organize here first.

101
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,872
Your father and I,
we want to make a present to you.

102
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,292
We want to get you out of that junker.

103
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,252
What junker?

104
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:09,962
That.

105
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:15,718
- We want to buy you a new car.
- That's right.

106
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:17,261
A new car?

107
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,599
Why would I want a new car?

108
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:24,394
Datsun runs great.

109
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:28,731
Do you think I want some fancy boat?

110
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,611
Are you worried
what the neighbors might think?

111
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,572
Well, we weren't gonna get you
a brand new Cadillac, Chris.

112
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:39,867
We just want to get you a nice new car
that's safe to drive.

113
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:43,538
And you never know when that thing
out there just might blow up.

114
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:49,836
Blow up. Blow up?
Are you guys crazy? It's a great car.

115
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:54,632
I don't need a new car.
I don't want a new car.

116
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,051
- I don't want anything.
- Okay.

117
00:19:57,136 --> 00:20:00,888
- These things, things, things, things.
- Okay.

118
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:02,765
- Everything has to be difficult.
- Thank you.

119
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,934
- Thank you.
- Maybe that's not what he means.

120
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:08,688
Maybe he just wants his old car.
It's not such a big deal.

121
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:13,651
Thank you. I just don't want anything.

122
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:25,413
<i>Chris measured himself
and those around him</i>

123
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:28,082
<i>by a fiercely rigorous moral code.</i>

124
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,292
Bye, Chris!

125
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:32,712
<i>He risked what could have been
a relentlessly lonely path</i>

126
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:36,509
<i>but found company
in the characters of the books he loved</i>

127
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:43,349
<i>from writers like Tolstoy,
Jack London and Thoreau.</i>

128
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:48,188
<i>He could summon their words
to suit any occasion,</i>

129
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,690
<i>and he often would.</i>

130
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:11,127
<i>I forgot to ask what quote he'd have
picked for his graduation dinner,</i>

131
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:14,798
<i>but I had a good idea
of who the primary target would be.</i>

132
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:22,639
<i>It was inevitable
that Chris would break away.</i>

133
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,728
<i>And when he did, he would do it
with characteristic immoderation.</i>

134
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:19,112
<i>"It should not be denied that being
footloose has always exhilarated us.</i>

135
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:23,032
<i>"It is associated in our minds
with escape</i>

136
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:28,037
<i>"from history and oppression and law
and irksome obligations.</i>

137
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,291
<i>"Absolute freedom.</i>

138
00:22:33,544 --> 00:22:35,962
<i>"And the road has always led west."</i>

139
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,711
<i>I need a name.</i>

140
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:08,950
<i>Toward the end of June,</i>

141
00:25:09,035 --> 00:25:12,078
<i>Emory had mailed our parents
Chris' final grade report.</i>

142
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:14,247
<i>Almost all A's.</i>

143
00:25:14,665 --> 00:25:17,419
<i>A in Apartheid in South African Society.</i>

144
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:22,758
<i>A- minus in Contemporary African
Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa.</i>

145
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:27,012
<i>And on it went. Clever boy, my brother.</i>

146
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:32,309
<i>But by the end of July,
we hadn't heard anything from him</i>

147
00:25:32,393 --> 00:25:34,936
<i>and my parents
were becoming unsettled.</i>

148
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:38,899
<i>Chris had never had a phone,</i>

149
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:42,486
<i>so they decided to drive down
to Atlanta and surprise him.</i>

150
00:25:57,585 --> 00:26:00,337
<i>When they arrived at the apartment,
there was a "For Rent" sign up</i>

151
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:03,924
<i>and the manager said that Chris
had moved out at the end of May.</i>

152
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:06,051
Oh, yes. He left two months ago.

153
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:08,345
<i>So when they got home,</i>

154
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:12,557
<i>I had to hand them all the letters that
they had sent Chris that summer,</i>

155
00:26:13,142 --> 00:26:16,978
<i>which had been returned in a bundle.</i>

156
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:21,566
<i>Chris had arranged for the post office
to hold them until August 1st,</i>

157
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:24,528
<i>to buy himself some time.</i>

158
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:27,614
Did you know about this?

159
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,117
He didn't say anything.

160
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:34,287
<i>I understood what he was doing.
That he had spent four years</i>

161
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:38,458
<i>fulfilling the absurd and tedious duty
of graduating from college,</i>

162
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:45,549
<i>and now he was emancipated
from that world of abstraction,</i>

163
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:50,178
<i>false security, parents
and material excess,</i>

164
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,016
<i>the things that cut Chris off
from the truth of his existence.</i>

165
00:28:09,302 --> 00:28:10,469
Hey!

166
00:28:14,474 --> 00:28:17,351
- Hey, man. Step around. Jump in.
- Okay, great.

167
00:28:17,936 --> 00:28:21,188
We barely saw you there
underneath that crazy hat of yours.

168
00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:25,025
This door's a little tricky.
There you go. Hop in.

169
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:29,863
That's Rainey.

170
00:28:29,948 --> 00:28:31,657
- Hi, Rainey.
- Yeah, I'm Rainey.

171
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:33,408
- I'm Jan.
- Hi. I'm Alex.

172
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:34,826
Alex with the hat on.

173
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,995
- Yeah, I know. You said it, man.
- Yeah.

174
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:40,707
So you're a leather now.

175
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,043
I'm a leather?

176
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:48,257
Yeah, a leather tramp. That's what they
call the ones that hoof it, go on foot.

177
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:51,301
Technically we're rubber tramps.

178
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:53,428
Because we have a vehicle.

179
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:57,891
- You don't have to push me away.
- Come on, please?

180
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:04,523
Yeah, Alex could have a vehicle as well,
but he decided to burn all of his money.

181
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:08,777
And why did you do that?

182
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,865
I don't need money.
Makes people cautious.

183
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:18,787
Come on, Alex.
You gotta be a little cautious.

184
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:21,957
I mean, that book of yours is cool
and everything,

185
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:25,335
but you can't depend entirely
on leaves and berries.

186
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:30,090
I don't know if you want to depend on
much more than that.

187
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,051
Where are your mom and dad?

188
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:38,265
Living their lies somewhere.

189
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,812
You look like a loved kid. Be fair.

190
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,064
Fair?

191
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:48,900
You know what I mean.

192
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:54,197
I'll paraphrase Thoreau here.

193
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:59,496
"Rather than love, than money,
than faith,

194
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:03,625
"than fame, than fairness,

195
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:07,629
"give me truth."

196
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:32,112
<i>From as long ago
as Chris and I could remember,</i>

197
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,449
<i>there have been
daily bouts of rage in our house.</i>

198
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:40,037
<i>Violence that we were forced
to witness. It was very real.</i>

199
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:44,541
<i>But it was also like theater.</i>

200
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:50,005
<i>They cast us as both judges
and the accused.</i>

201
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,969
And I got you this token,
this expensive token.

202
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,555
<i>Dad had been the young genius</i>

203
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,435
<i>that NASA enlisted to do crucial designs
for the American satellite radar systems</i>

204
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,065
<i>that would be our answer
to the Russian Sputnik.</i>

205
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:10,567
<i>And Mom and he later started up
a consulting firm</i>

206
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:14,113
<i>combining her
get-up-and-go resourcefulness</i>

207
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:15,823
<i>with his wealth of knowledge.</i>

208
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,117
Look at this.

209
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:24,873
<i>But by the time the company
actually made its first million,</i>

210
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:30,003
<i>the careerism and money seemed
only to embolden their blindness.</i>

211
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,631
Thank you very, very much.

212
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:36,218
<i>I remember the first family meeting</i>

213
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:40,013
<i>to let us in on their plans
for getting a divorce.</i>

214
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:44,184
<i>They wanted us to choose
which of them we'd live with.</i>

215
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:48,021
<i>We cried our eyes out.</i>

216
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,484
<i>The divorce never happened,</i>

217
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:56,363
<i>but the battles and the meetings
never stopped.</i>

218
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,701
<i>It wasn't very long
before Chris and I shut off.</i>

219
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:05,372
<i>We'd say "Go ahead.</i>

220
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,625
<i>"Get the divorce."</i>

221
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:14,967
Jeez. If I struck a match to you I'd have
dinner and warmth at the same time.

222
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,720
Where's Jan going?

223
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:21,849
Well, my friend,

224
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:25,895
all is not well on the hippie front.

225
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:38,741
You're an industrious little fucker,
aren't you?

226
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:41,327
Little bit.

227
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:50,711
It's funny how things happen
at particular times.

228
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:56,133
I've loved that woman
for a lot of years, bro.

229
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:01,764
But, you know, she's got a story.

230
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:06,936
We've been going through this thing,
real quiet.

231
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:13,651
So when we ran into you yesterday,

232
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,446
this thing that we've been going
through real quiet,

233
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,450
she's talking about it.
You know what I mean?

234
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:24,870
- I think I do.
- You think what?

235
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:28,791
Well...

236
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:35,798
Some people feel like
they don't deserve love.

237
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:40,594
They walk away quietly
into empty spaces,

238
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:45,307
trying to close the gaps to the past.

239
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:48,561
That's a hell of an insight. Jesus!

240
00:33:51,523 --> 00:33:54,525
- You're not Jesus, are you?
- Look who's talking.

241
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:59,321
You gonna walk across the water
and get her back for me, pal?

242
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:03,784
No. I'm afraid of water.

243
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:06,036
Always have been.

244
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:12,167
Something I've gotta get over sometime
though, huh? So I will swim in it

245
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:15,337
if you'll carry the firewood back to camp.

246
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:19,258
- Shit, yeah.
- Yeah?

247
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:21,844
- Call it carried.
- All right.

248
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,383
<i>"The sea's only gifts are harsh blows,</i>

249
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:06,057
<i>"and, occasionally,
the chance to feel strong.</i>

250
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:10,394
<i>"Now, I don't know much about the sea,</i>

251
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:14,065
<i>"but I do know that
that's the way it is here.</i>

252
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:18,110
<i>"And I also know
how important it is in life</i>

253
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:22,239
<i>"not necessarily to be strong,
but to feel strong,</i>

254
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,993
<i>"to measure yourself at least once,</i>

255
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:32,083
<i>"to find yourself at least once in
the most ancient of human conditions,</i>

256
00:35:33,752 --> 00:35:36,337
<i>"facing the blind, deaf stone alone</i>

257
00:35:36,922 --> 00:35:41,092
<i>"with nothing to help you
but your hands and your own head."</i>

258
00:35:46,264 --> 00:35:48,557
There's a big wave coming!

259
00:35:52,312 --> 00:35:54,897
Rainey, I'm freezing!

260
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,652
Could you put your arms around me?

261
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:26,262
The Navy bulldozed and abandoned this
base down there,

262
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:33,352
and all that's left is this huge grid
of concrete foundations, or slabs.

263
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,857
- Man, you would dig the Slabs.
- You would like it. You would like it.

264
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:40,151
- If you're on the road still.
- You'd love it.

265
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:41,694
Fellow travelers.

266
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:44,405
Just living on the cheap under the sun.
Can't beat it.

267
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:45,865
Sounds good.

268
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:48,701
If you come, I'll make you a proper hat.

269
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:51,912
- Promise?
- I swear to God.

270
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:02,425
Oh, baby. Baby.

271
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:05,344
- Stop it. Wait.
- Yeah.

272
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:10,475
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

273
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,811
Let me turn off the light.

274
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:59,732
- He reminded me of...
- I know.

275
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:11,619
<i>Such is the way of the world</i>

276
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:14,205
<i>You can never know</i>

277
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:23,047
<i>Just where to put all your faith
And how will it grow?</i>

278
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,510
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

279
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:32,223
<i>Burning back holes in dark memories</i>

280
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:35,601
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

281
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:40,022
<i>Turning mistakes into gold</i>

282
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:43,776
I mean, you're really good.
I mean, you're like

283
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:49,949
100,000 times better than, like,
any apple I've ever had.

284
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,120
I'm not Superman, I'm Supertramp.

285
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,207
You're Superapple.

286
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:05,006
You're so tasty.
You're so organic, so natural.

287
00:39:06,174 --> 00:39:08,301
You're the apple of my eye.

288
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:17,186
<i>Hey! Such is the passage of time
Too fast to fold</i>

289
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:25,028
<i>And suddenly swallowed by signs
Lo and behold</i>

290
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,157
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

291
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:33,828
<i>Find my direction magnetically</i>

292
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:37,081
<i>Gonna rise up</i>

293
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:41,669
<i>Throw down my ace in the hole</i>

294
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,259
<i>In early September, Mom and Dad
got a call from the Annandale police</i>

295
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,428
<i>notifying them that
Chris' abandoned car</i>

296
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:53,932
<i>had been identified
by the Arizona Highway Patrol.</i>

297
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:58,603
<i>A group of rare flower hunters
stumbled upon it in the desert.</i>

298
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,483
<i>There were no signs that
Chris had intended to return to it.</i>

299
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,736
<i>But there wasn't
any evidence of struggle, either.</i>

300
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,074
<i>The police thought
Chris had chosen to leave it behind</i>

301
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,868
<i>and not that it was taken from him.</i>

302
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:22,377
<i>The initial comfort
that gave Mom and Dad quickly turned</i>

303
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:27,215
<i>to the realization that Chris
was actually trying not to be found.</i>

304
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,757
Strong.

305
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,388
You can do anything.
You can go anywhere.

306
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:22,186
<i>Money, power is an illusion.
It's up here.</i>

307
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,273
You can be here.

308
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,068
Me and you.

309
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:48,089
One, two. No, no, no.

310
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,307
Two,

311
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,146
three...

312
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,407
Don't be shy with it. Get it moving there.
That's good.

313
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,785
- That's your speed right here.
- Right.

314
00:42:59,995 --> 00:43:02,038
You go too fast,
you won't get all the wheat.

315
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,958
That's it, straight line, straight line,
little straighter.

316
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:08,378
See how you're bearing? Just a little
straighter. Now you're a combiner.

317
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,547
Wow, look at this view!

318
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:13,299
But keep your eye on the wheat, here.
Make sure you're cutting it.

319
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:16,594
You can look back here and see
how much is coming out, all right.

320
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:18,304
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

321
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:21,474
Okay, keep it straight. God bless you.

322
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,852
Make yourself some money, my friend.
I'll see you in a little bit.

323
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:25,019
Okay.

324
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:35,572
Wayne. Where you going?

325
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:58,763
Kevin, you know I love you.
I'm joking with you. I'm joking. Stop it.

326
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,184
- I'm joking with you.
- Mind your own business, Wayne!

327
00:44:02,268 --> 00:44:04,436
- What are you getting so hostile for?
- I don't know.

328
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,855
Me and you are on the same side.
We're on the same side.

329
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:10,025
- I'm just tired of the teasing a lot.
- Kevin, we're on the same side.

330
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:14,738
Let me get some...
If I want some vagina, let me get it.

331
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:17,365
- Whoa. He's serious about this.
- Let's just play cards.

332
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,034
- Can we just play cards?
- Let's go, then.

333
00:44:19,118 --> 00:44:21,870
$2, $4, $6, just put all the money in.

334
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:23,788
I just wanna see
everybody going for broke.

335
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:26,458
- You want to play?
- No.

336
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,225
- Kevin, what have you got for the week?
- I got 260.

337
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:45,018
We're at 260.

338
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:53,360
We're gonna stay right at 260,
that's our number.

339
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:55,278
We've got 20,000 pounds.

340
00:44:55,363 --> 00:44:59,241
We've got 20,000 pounds
we need to get rid of.

341
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,081
Maybe just do all that after lunch
before we get back into everything else.

342
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:09,668
Can we do the $500 reserves...

343
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:21,096
What do you think about all this?

344
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:23,515
I like all this.

345
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:37,988
I don't think he can do it.

346
00:45:41,117 --> 00:45:43,201
Is there a library
or bookstore around here

347
00:45:43,286 --> 00:45:45,370
where I can get books
on hunting and preserving?

348
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,455
Anything at all to do with hunting
or preserving the meat,

349
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,624
smoking it, whatever the hell it is,

350
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:52,585
talk to Kevin over there.
That's your man.

351
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,131
Outdoorsman. What's your fascination
with all that stuff?

352
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:57,841
I'm going to Alaska.

353
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:01,094
Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?

354
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:03,722
Because they do have markets
in Alaska.

355
00:46:03,806 --> 00:46:06,975
The city ofAlaska. Not in Alaska.
In the city ofAlaska, they have markets.

356
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:10,353
No, man. Alaska, Alaska.

357
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:14,693
I'm gonna be all the way out there,
all the way fucking out there.

358
00:46:15,403 --> 00:46:16,611
Just on my own.

359
00:46:16,696 --> 00:46:22,200
You know, no fucking watch,
no map, no ax, no nothing. No nothing.

360
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:24,995
Just be out there. Just be out there in it.

361
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:29,458
You know, big mountains, rivers,
sky, game.

362
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:33,420
Just be out there in it, you know?
In the wild.

363
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:35,505
- In the wild.
- Just wild.

364
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,591
- Yeah.
- Just...

365
00:46:37,717 --> 00:46:38,759
What are you doing when we're there?

366
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:41,053
Now you're in the wild,
what are we doing?

367
00:46:41,137 --> 00:46:42,304
You're just living, man.

368
00:46:42,388 --> 00:46:45,807
You're just there, in that moment,
in that special place and time.

369
00:46:45,892 --> 00:46:47,100
Yeah.

370
00:46:47,226 --> 00:46:49,770
Maybe when I get back,
I can write a book about my travels.

371
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:50,854
Why not?

372
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:53,023
You know,
about getting out of this sick society.

373
00:46:53,107 --> 00:46:55,901
- Society!
- Society!

374
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:57,569
- Society, man!
- Society!

375
00:46:57,653 --> 00:46:59,863
- Society! Society!
- Society!

376
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:02,699
Society, you know! Society!

377
00:47:03,493 --> 00:47:06,161
'Cause you know
what I don't understand?

378
00:47:06,245 --> 00:47:10,207
I don't understand why people,
why every fucking person

379
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:13,668
is so bad to each other so fucking often.

380
00:47:13,753 --> 00:47:18,882
It doesn't make sense to me. Judgment.
Control. All that, the whole spectrum.

381
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:22,803
- Well, it just...
- What "people" we talking about?

382
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:29,142
You know, parents, hypocrites,

383
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:33,480
politicians, pricks.

384
00:47:35,108 --> 00:47:37,567
This is a mistake.

385
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:41,321
It's a mistake to get too deep
into all that kind of stuff.

386
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:47,244
Alex, you're a hell of a young guy,
a hell of a young guy.

387
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,747
But I promise you this.

388
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:56,545
You're a young guy! Can't be juggling
blood and fire all the time!

389
00:47:57,004 --> 00:48:00,257
- You've got to just kind of...
- Wayne, what are you talking about?

390
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:01,758
- What?
- I mean...

391
00:48:01,843 --> 00:48:03,093
I'm talking about blood and fire.

392
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:05,262
We're talking about
trying to juggle blood and fire.

393
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:07,055
Who are you to be giving advice
to anybody anyway?

394
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,723
Who am I to be giving advice
to anybody?

395
00:48:08,808 --> 00:48:10,434
- Yes.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

396
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:12,310
- My name is Mr. Happy.
- Mr. Happy.

397
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:14,646
And Mr. Happy sometimes gives advice.

398
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,773
- Alex, please.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:19,484
Sometimes Mr. Happy...
Well, Mr. Happy is always happy.

400
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:21,027
But you know when he's happiest?

401
00:48:21,112 --> 00:48:22,487
- He's not always happy.
- When is he happy?

402
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:25,115
Are you really gonna say that to me?
Come on, tell me about it.

403
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:27,159
I am going to say that to you.

404
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:34,543
- Now...
- Sit down before you hurt yourself.

405
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:37,838
One thing that you should try
to keep your eye on

406
00:48:38,506 --> 00:48:41,550
is what happened
in the late 1940s in Roswell.

407
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:57,733
<i>When a search of tax records
revealed that</i>

408
00:48:57,817 --> 00:49:00,402
<i>Chris had given
his life savings to charity,</i>

409
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:05,073
<i>Mom and Dad became
what Dad called "mobilized."</i>

410
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:09,661
<i>They hired a private investigator and
notified law enforcement nationwide,</i>

411
00:49:09,954 --> 00:49:12,331
<i>determined to track him down.</i>

412
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:17,211
<i>I just figured he'd be with gypsies,
far from the eyes of the law.</i>

413
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:23,675
These are those free satellite TV deals.

414
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,678
You're the one who said it, Alex, not me.

415
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,350
You're gonna need something.
What kind of gun you got?

416
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:35,771
I'm probably gonna get like a.22,
I think. A.22 caliber rifle.

417
00:49:37,982 --> 00:49:39,441
All right, then.

418
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:42,694
When you get your kill,
time is of the essence.

419
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,863
Now, the first thing you wanna do
is make sure

420
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,950
that you got that meat
nice and shaved up.

421
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:50,619
And you don't have a lot of time to do
this. This is about an hour or two.

422
00:49:50,703 --> 00:49:54,623
Depending on the weather. Especially if
it's hot, you've got less time to do it.

423
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:58,877
What you do is you want to make sure
that them flies don't land on your meat.

424
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:02,798
Because once them flies start
shitting out larvae and them maggots,

425
00:50:03,508 --> 00:50:07,553
you know, those creepy crawlies,
it's too late. It's too late.

426
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,458
You got me. You got me.

427
00:51:23,256 --> 00:51:25,841
I warned Wayne
about them little black boxes.

428
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:29,637
Mr. Westerberg, Scott Baker, FBI.
I think you know why we're here.

429
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:31,889
- Impressive turn-out.
- Yeah.

430
00:51:31,973 --> 00:51:35,059
You mind grabbing that zipper
for me there? Thank you.

431
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:36,894
- Let's go.
- Sorry, boys.

432
00:51:36,978 --> 00:51:39,229
We're gonna have to shut down
for a little while.

433
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:42,066
Alex, you come back
and work for me any time you want.

434
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,860
Gil's got your checks, guys.
I shouldn't be away too long.

435
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:49,823
Remember Alex, no Alaska till spring.
South, kid. You wanna head south.

436
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:17,768
<i>The year Chris graduated high school,</i>

437
00:52:17,852 --> 00:52:21,271
<i>he bought the Datsun used
and drove it cross-country.</i>

438
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:24,775
<i>He stayed away most of the summer.</i>

439
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,861
Come on. The neighbors
are gonna be watching, honey.

440
00:52:27,946 --> 00:52:29,279
Can you spray it?

441
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:38,789
<i>As soon as I heard he was home,
I ran into his room to talk to him.</i>

442
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:47,172
<i>In California,
he'd looked up some old family friends.</i>

443
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:52,803
<i>He discovered that our parents' stories
of how they fell in love and got married</i>

444
00:52:52,887 --> 00:52:55,764
<i>were calculated lies
masking an ugly truth.</i>

445
00:52:56,975 --> 00:52:59,643
<i>When they met,
Dad was already married.</i>

446
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,896
<i>And even after Chris was born,</i>

447
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:05,858
<i>Dad had had another son
with his first wife, Marcia,</i>

448
00:53:07,193 --> 00:53:09,820
<i>to whom he was still legally married.</i>

449
00:53:11,783 --> 00:53:16,996
<i>This fact suddenly re-defined
Chris and me as bastard children.</i>

450
00:53:21,626 --> 00:53:26,380
<i>Dad's arrogance made him conveniently
oblivious to the pain he caused.</i>

451
00:53:28,091 --> 00:53:32,178
<i>And Mom, in the shame and
embarrassment of a young mistress,</i>

452
00:53:32,804 --> 00:53:35,306
<i>became his accomplice in deceit.</i>

453
00:53:40,729 --> 00:53:44,482
<i>The fragility of crystal is not
a weakness but a fineness.</i>

454
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:48,778
<i>My parents understood that
a fine crystal glass had to be cared for</i>

455
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:51,280
<i>or it may be shattered.</i>

456
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:55,618
<i>But when it came to my brother,
they did not seem to know or care</i>

457
00:53:55,702 --> 00:53:57,953
<i>that their course of secret action</i>

458
00:53:58,038 --> 00:54:02,124
<i>brought the kind of devastation
that could cut them.</i>

459
00:54:03,794 --> 00:54:08,422
<i>Their fraudulent marriage
and our father's denial of this other son</i>

460
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:12,885
<i>was, for Chris,
a murder of every day's truth.</i>

461
00:54:14,012 --> 00:54:17,848
<i>He felt his whole life turn,
like a river suddenly reversing</i>

462
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:22,019
<i>the direction of its flow,
suddenly running uphill.</i>

463
00:54:28,735 --> 00:54:33,322
<i>These revelations struck at the core
of Chris' sense of identity.</i>

464
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:37,451
<i>They made his entire childhood
seem like fiction.</i>

465
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,163
<i>Chris never told them he knew</i>

466
00:54:44,584 --> 00:54:47,127
<i>and made me promise silence, as well.</i>

467
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:50,172
I can't afford four.
Who's gonna pay for the fourth one?

468
00:54:50,257 --> 00:54:53,425
Bryan can't afford four. Does it matter?

469
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:55,803
Can I help you?

470
00:54:55,887 --> 00:54:58,347
Yeah. If I wanted
to paddle down the river,

471
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:00,599
where's the best place to launch out of?

472
00:55:00,684 --> 00:55:01,851
Hang on a second.

473
00:55:01,935 --> 00:55:05,145
"To launch out of?"
What's your experience level?

474
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:09,567
- Not much.
- Any? Do you have a permit?

475
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:11,694
A permit? Permit for what?

476
00:55:12,237 --> 00:55:14,572
You can't paddle down the river
without a permit.

477
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:17,032
If you want, you can apply for one here,
get some experience,

478
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:19,034
and I'll put you on the wait-list.

479
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,787
No, I got this guy in here.
We'll figure it out.

480
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:24,456
There's a wait-list
to paddle down a river?

481
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:25,958
That's right.

482
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:28,502
- Yeah, it's gonna be...
- Well, how long do I have to wait?

483
00:55:28,587 --> 00:55:30,045
Yeah, hang on a second.

484
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:34,176
Now, the deal is
it's gonna be me and you

485
00:55:34,261 --> 00:55:37,597
or it's gonna be me, you and her.

486
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:42,268
Next available is May 17th, 2003.

487
00:55:43,145 --> 00:55:47,148
Great. Done. The three of us, then.

488
00:55:47,357 --> 00:55:48,816
Twelve years?

489
00:55:49,276 --> 00:55:51,235
- What's that?
- Twelve years?

490
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:52,987
To paddle down a river.

491
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:54,906
Let me call you back.

492
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:57,366
You can do that,

493
00:55:57,451 --> 00:56:00,578
or you can join a commercial raft trip,
go with a licensed guide.

494
00:56:00,662 --> 00:56:02,413
They may have some
last-minute cancellations,

495
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:05,041
but that's gonna cost you $2,000.

496
00:56:06,835 --> 00:56:08,586
Thank you very much.

497
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:47,959
Helmet, man!

498
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:28,624
I'm Supertramp!

499
00:57:41,722 --> 00:57:45,099
<i>"If we admit that human life
can be ruled by reason,</i>

500
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:48,436
<i>"the possibility of life is destroyed."</i>

501
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:20,428
Hello!

502
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,057
Hello.

503
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,226
Come. Join us.

504
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,979
We have hot dogs.

505
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,913
- I'm Mads.
- Mads?

506
00:58:46,997 --> 00:58:48,581
- Mads. Hi.
- Mads.

507
00:58:48,665 --> 00:58:50,500
- Alex.
- Hi, Alex.

508
00:58:50,584 --> 00:58:52,627
Hey. I'm Sonja.

509
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,004
Hey, Alex.

510
00:58:56,423 --> 00:59:00,635
We are from Copenhagen,
and you are from the rapids.

511
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:02,637
I am.

512
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:11,938
- You're crazy! You're crazy, man.
- My God!

513
00:59:12,022 --> 00:59:15,066
Sonja, get away from him. Get away
from him. He's crazy! Look, he's crazy.

514
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,360
I'll make you a hot dog. One minute.

515
00:59:20,405 --> 00:59:23,616
I love this. Don't you love this?

516
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:27,203
You know, this is nature.

517
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:38,214
So where are you going?

518
00:59:38,882 --> 00:59:41,425
- I haven't decided yet.
- Really?

519
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:44,846
Well, we like it here very much.
And it's so good to meet you, man.

520
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,055
So good to meet you.

521
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:50,184
You know, we went to Los Angeles,
and then we went to Las Vegas.

522
00:59:50,269 --> 00:59:55,148
Oh, yeah. Las Vegas is very nice.
The universe is so good.

523
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,864
- The universe is very good.
- You know what I mean?

524
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:05,199
- Yeah.
- The whole universe.

525
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:09,662
Just the place. The city, she means.
Her English is not very good.

526
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:14,752
But then we came here. I don't care
if she's a little stupid, but I like her.

527
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:18,506
You know you can actually go
all the way down to Mexico from here.

528
01:00:18,591 --> 01:00:19,632
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

529
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:24,262
You can take the kayak,
and you can take it all the way around

530
01:00:24,346 --> 01:00:26,723
down to Hoover Dam,
you can sail around,

531
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:31,269
and then from there you can take
the river all the way down to Mexico!

532
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:33,438
- Really?
- Yeah.

533
01:00:37,193 --> 01:00:39,110
Come on, come on!

534
01:00:39,612 --> 01:00:41,946
She's so slow sometimes.

535
01:00:42,948 --> 01:00:46,492
- Here's the map.
- But I like her.

536
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:51,289
- Here. Hoover Dam.
- Okay.

537
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:53,750
About 330 kilometers, I think.

538
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:56,711
- Miles?
- Yeah, miles, about 200 miles.

539
01:00:56,795 --> 01:01:00,882
- Two hundred miles.
- Two hundred miles. Yeah, man.

540
01:01:01,383 --> 01:01:02,842
You know, I wonder if I could paddle

541
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:05,053
all the way down that
into the Gulf of California.

542
01:01:05,137 --> 01:01:07,972
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can.
You know, I will go with you.

543
01:01:08,474 --> 01:01:10,975
I will go with you. We leave Sonja here,
and then we take the kayak.

544
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,311
No, no.
We go all the way down into Mexico.

545
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:18,149
You know, because in every man's
heart, there is a Mexican mistress.

546
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,626
Oh, man.

547
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:39,420
I've gotta go, you guys.
I'm really sorry. I gotta go.

548
01:01:39,505 --> 01:01:41,381
- What's going on?
- Why?

549
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:45,093
The river patrol's after me. I'm actually
not supposed to be here, you know.

550
01:01:45,177 --> 01:01:46,761
You have to have, like, a permit,

551
01:01:46,845 --> 01:01:50,515
it's like a government thing to be here,
and I didn't get one.

552
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:52,475
If you see anybody,
any of the rangers or anything,

553
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,435
just tell them you didn't see me, okay?

554
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,603
Okay.

555
01:01:55,688 --> 01:02:00,233
Okay, again, I'm really, really sorry,
man. I wish I could stay, you know.

556
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:01,317
Take care, man.

557
01:02:01,402 --> 01:02:02,443
- All right. Take care, Mads.
- Nice to meet you.

558
01:02:02,528 --> 01:02:05,446
- Bye, Alex.
- I wish... I wish I could stay.

559
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:07,865
Say hello to Mexico from me.

560
01:02:10,286 --> 01:02:12,453
Bye, Alex!

561
01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:47,657
<i>It would be Christmas
in a couple of months,</i>

562
01:02:48,034 --> 01:02:51,619
<i>and the last news we'd had
was about his car being found.</i>

563
01:02:52,163 --> 01:02:56,541
<i>I woke up a couple of days ago,
and for the first time, it bothered me</i>

564
01:02:56,751 --> 01:03:00,170
<i>that it wasn't only my parents
who hadn't heard from Chris.</i>

565
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:01,379
Honey?

566
01:03:01,464 --> 01:03:06,009
It's me. I'm sorry.
Everything that happened, it's my fault.

567
01:03:07,595 --> 01:03:09,512
Give me another chance.

568
01:03:11,265 --> 01:03:14,768
Please do that... Come on.
Do that for me.

569
01:03:17,897 --> 01:03:20,190
Come on. They're calling
for another quarter right now,

570
01:03:20,274 --> 01:03:22,901
and I ain't got it, so will you hurry it up?

571
01:03:24,236 --> 01:03:26,321
Come on now, don't hang up on me.

572
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:30,200
Hey, here's a quarter.

573
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:31,618
Thank you.

574
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:35,663
There's a quarter
just happened out of the sky,

575
01:03:35,748 --> 01:03:39,125
so I'm on here talking to you again.

576
01:03:40,336 --> 01:03:43,838
I got the quarter now, let's...
No, no, no, no, no!

577
01:03:48,677 --> 01:03:52,514
<i>I wondered why he hadn't tried to call
in case I might answer.</i>

578
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:55,350
<i>He could've hung up if it wasn't me.</i>

579
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:00,146
<i>Why wouldn't he send a letter,
maybe through a friend?</i>

580
01:04:00,231 --> 01:04:01,856
<i>It hurt a little,</i>

581
01:04:04,276 --> 01:04:06,903
<i>but I told myself it was good.</i>

582
01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:12,826
<i>He knew I loved him enough
to bear with the not knowing.</i>

583
01:04:14,954 --> 01:04:19,290
<i>And it helped me remember that there
was something more than rebellion,</i>

584
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:22,168
<i>more than anger that was driving him.</i>

585
01:04:28,676 --> 01:04:32,470
<i>Chris had always been driven,
had always been an adventurer.</i>

586
01:04:46,694 --> 01:04:48,528
<i>When he was four years old,</i>

587
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:53,660
<i>he once wandered six blocks away
from home at 3:00 in the morning.</i>

588
01:05:00,376 --> 01:05:02,669
<i>He was found in a neighbor's kitchen</i>

589
01:05:02,753 --> 01:05:06,006
<i>up on a chair,
digging through their candy drawer.</i>

590
01:05:08,468 --> 01:05:13,346
<i>Whatever drawer he was opening now
must have something pretty sweet in it.</i>

591
01:07:11,634 --> 01:07:15,554
<i>- You lived in a cave for 36 days?
- Yes, sir.</i>

592
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,681
<i>And how did you get into Mexico
in the first place?</i>

593
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:20,350
<i>Through the spillway at Morelos Dam.</i>

594
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:22,811
<i>River dries out pretty quickly
beyond there, doesn't it?</i>

595
01:07:22,895 --> 01:07:27,691
<i>Yeah. Turns into a maze of irrigation
canals, thanks to our dams up north.</i>

596
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:32,029
<i>So I ported my kayak over the desert,
and I hitched down to Golfo.</i>

597
01:07:33,197 --> 01:07:37,367
<i>But after a few weeks, a sandstorm
came up and blew the kayak away.</i>

598
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:40,037
<i>So I walked back north. Here I am.</i>

599
01:07:40,121 --> 01:07:43,832
<i>Well, you just can't be crossing
the borders without any identification.</i>

600
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,792
- Are we understood?
- Yes, sir.

601
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:48,337
I've eaten enough sand to send me
back to the city anyway.

602
01:07:48,421 --> 01:07:51,131
All right. Sit tight. I'll be right back.

603
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:56,595
<i>Some may ask,
"Why act now? Why not wait?"</i>

604
01:07:57,388 --> 01:08:01,141
<i>The answer is clear.
The world could wait no longer.</i>

605
01:10:27,373 --> 01:10:29,082
Hi. Do you have the time?

606
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:31,001
- Time?
- Time?

607
01:10:31,085 --> 01:10:32,336
Yeah.

608
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,047
Okay.

609
01:11:15,964 --> 01:11:17,339
Front and back.

610
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:21,426
I don't have any more clipboards,
so get one from the other fellas.

611
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:23,178
- Next.
- Hi.

612
01:11:23,429 --> 01:11:25,806
Can you tell me how to get an ID?

613
01:11:25,974 --> 01:11:28,725
- Did you lose your identification, sir?
- Yeah.

614
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:31,395
No birth certificate? Nothing?

615
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:32,771
Ouch.

616
01:11:33,064 --> 01:11:36,817
All right. Well, you're gonna
have to work that out with the DMV.

617
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:41,196
You can catch them in the morning.
The closest one is Montebello,

618
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,199
and we can help you
with the bus voucher.

619
01:11:44,284 --> 01:11:46,368
So just come to this desk
when you're ready for the voucher.

620
01:11:46,452 --> 01:11:48,080
- Okay.
- What's your name?

621
01:11:48,164 --> 01:11:51,834
- Alexander Supertramp.
- What's that?

622
01:11:51,918 --> 01:11:57,798
- Alexander Supertramp.
- Supertramp. Really?

623
01:11:58,049 --> 01:11:59,049
Yeah.

624
01:12:00,176 --> 01:12:03,929
Okay, so I'm gonna look for you,
Supertramp. I got something for you.

625
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:08,851
- Here you go, Supertramp.
- Thank you very much.

626
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:10,227
Okay, baby.

627
01:12:10,312 --> 01:12:13,355
- And one last thing.
- Yeah.

628
01:12:15,275 --> 01:12:17,693
Do you have a bed for me? I'm sorry...

629
01:12:17,777 --> 01:12:21,572
Oh, no. Sure, I got a bed for you.
Sign your name right here.

630
01:12:21,656 --> 01:12:26,869
You fill this out. And I'll set you right up.
Now, I'm out of...

631
01:12:26,953 --> 01:12:29,788
- What's going on back there?
- I got it. I'm sorry.

632
01:12:29,873 --> 01:12:33,250
- Come on, now. Work with me.
- All right. Thanks, ma'am.

633
01:12:33,335 --> 01:12:35,669
Supertramp, huh?

634
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:40,507
You know the drill.

635
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,292
Move it!

636
01:14:02,882 --> 01:14:05,509
Thanks, but I'm not gonna need
that bed after all.

637
01:14:05,593 --> 01:14:07,805
You leaving us so soon? Supertramp!

638
01:15:11,495 --> 01:15:15,831
Show me your face.
I never, ever, ever forget a face.

639
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:19,251
If I see yours again,
I won't arrest you, I'll kill you.

640
01:15:19,336 --> 01:15:21,212
This is the goddamned railroad,

641
01:15:21,296 --> 01:15:22,922
and we will do whatever we have to do

642
01:15:23,006 --> 01:15:25,424
to keep you freeloaders
from violating our liability.

643
01:15:25,509 --> 01:15:26,801
Yes, sir.

644
01:15:30,514 --> 01:15:32,181
You got any ID?

645
01:15:33,517 --> 01:15:36,727
- No, sir.
- Of course you don't.

646
01:15:37,604 --> 01:15:39,396
Last time, my friend.

647
01:15:40,524 --> 01:15:41,857
All clear.

648
01:15:49,866 --> 01:15:51,242
Good boy!

649
01:16:09,302 --> 01:16:12,388
<i>Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
Finally!</i>

650
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,769
<i>It's a mystery to me</i>

651
01:16:19,604 --> 01:16:24,984
<i>We have a greed
With which we have agreed</i>

652
01:16:26,403 --> 01:16:31,242
<i>You think you have to want more
than you need</i>

653
01:16:32,452 --> 01:16:37,165
<i>Until you have it all you won't be freed</i>

654
01:16:40,085 --> 01:16:45,506
<i>Society, you're a crazy breed</i>

655
01:16:46,049 --> 01:16:52,013
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

656
01:16:55,434 --> 01:17:00,479
<i>When you want more than you have
You think you need</i>

657
01:17:01,398 --> 01:17:06,277
<i>And when you think more than you want
Your thoughts begin to bleed</i>

658
01:17:07,821 --> 01:17:12,783
<i>I think I need to find a bigger place</i>

659
01:17:13,285 --> 01:17:15,661
<i>'Cause when you have
more than you think</i>

660
01:17:15,746 --> 01:17:17,955
<i>You need more space</i>

661
01:17:21,543 --> 01:17:26,964
<i>Society, you're a crazy breed</i>

662
01:17:27,466 --> 01:17:32,428
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

663
01:17:33,347 --> 01:17:38,392
<i>Society, crazy indeed</i>

664
01:17:39,311 --> 01:17:45,650
<i>I hope you're not lonely without me</i>

665
01:18:35,033 --> 01:18:36,492
Thanks a lot.

666
01:18:45,711 --> 01:18:48,673
<i>In the letters
Chris wrote me from college,</i>

667
01:18:49,216 --> 01:18:53,428
<i>it was clear his anguish and problems
with Mom and Dad had continued.</i>

668
01:19:02,896 --> 01:19:04,772
<i>He said I was
the only person in the world</i>

669
01:19:04,857 --> 01:19:07,483
<i>who could possibly understand
what he had to say.</i>

670
01:19:07,568 --> 01:19:10,570
With whose money are you buying
all these goddamn presents?

671
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:13,072
I work. The only reason
I'm not talking is because

672
01:19:13,157 --> 01:19:15,825
you're wandering around acting like
the big-shot flirt with everybody.

673
01:19:15,909 --> 01:19:19,495
I am making the contacts
for this business to work!

674
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,581
You don't care at all about what I do!

675
01:19:21,665 --> 01:19:23,499
I don't even want to talk to you
about it anymore!

676
01:19:23,584 --> 01:19:26,669
Don't you walk away from me, woman!
Woman!

677
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:29,672
Kids! Look what your dad
is doing to me!

678
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,176
For God's sake,
look what your mother is making me do!

679
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,261
Fuck you! I hate you!

680
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:40,808
There ain't gonna be no party.
I'm gonna cancel Christmas this year.

681
01:19:40,934 --> 01:19:44,187
<i>Cancel Christmas?
Who do you think you are? God?</i>

682
01:19:44,271 --> 01:19:46,105
<i>That's right! I'm God!</i>

683
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:49,025
<i>Well, you're not God.
You can't cancel Christmas.</i>

684
01:19:49,276 --> 01:19:50,610
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

685
01:21:46,729 --> 01:21:48,229
We're 10 deep!

686
01:21:56,113 --> 01:22:00,909
Alex, I don't mean to be on you about
everything. You're doing a great job.

687
01:22:01,118 --> 01:22:04,829
I wanna keep you on and
we all wanna help you get to Alaska,

688
01:22:05,498 --> 01:22:08,124
but you've got to start wearing socks.

689
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:19,761
<i>With almost a year having passed
since Chris' disappearance,</i>

690
01:22:20,304 --> 01:22:23,681
<i>my parents' anger, their desperation,</i>

691
01:22:23,766 --> 01:22:26,100
<i>their guilt was giving way to pain.</i>

692
01:22:29,104 --> 01:22:31,731
<i>And pain seemed to bring them closer.</i>

693
01:22:34,068 --> 01:22:36,277
<i>Even their faces had changed.</i>

694
01:23:02,471 --> 01:23:04,931
<i>She convinces herself it's Chris,</i>

695
01:23:06,308 --> 01:23:09,644
<i>that it's her son
whenever she passes a stray.</i>

696
01:23:11,438 --> 01:23:13,815
<i>And I fear for the mother in her.</i>

697
01:23:17,486 --> 01:23:22,490
<i>Instincts that seem to sense the threat
of a loss so huge</i>

698
01:23:22,575 --> 01:23:27,289
<i>and irrevocable that the mind balks
at taking its measure.</i>

699
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:34,087
<i>I'd begin to wonder if I can understand
all that Chris is saying any longer,</i>

700
01:23:37,258 --> 01:23:40,218
<i>but I catch myself and remember that</i>

701
01:23:40,303 --> 01:23:42,679
<i>these are not the parents
he grew up with,</i>

702
01:23:43,973 --> 01:23:48,602
<i>but people softened by the forced
reflection that comes with loss.</i>

703
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:58,278
<i>Still, everything Chris is saying
has to be said.</i>

704
01:24:00,031 --> 01:24:03,908
<i>And I trust for him that
everything he is doing has to be done.</i>

705
01:24:05,703 --> 01:24:07,329
<i>This is our life.</i>

706
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:18,650
Big game. Very big game.

707
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:20,276
Got it.

708
01:27:11,224 --> 01:27:12,599
Damn it!

709
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:18,271
Get off!

710
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:04,609
"Hey, Dad, can I light the barbeque,
please, Dad, this time?"

711
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,697
"Well, Son,
you can go get the lighter fluid."

712
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:09,283
"Come on, Dad. Please, Dad, please?"

713
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:12,536
"Well, why not, Walt?
That sounds like a good idea..."

714
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,538
"Shut up, Carine! Shut up, Carine!

715
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:19,126
"No, Billie. I told you once.
Don't make me tell you again. Okay?

716
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,128
"Okay?

717
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:23,046
"You hear me? You hear me, woman?

718
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:26,133
<i>"You hear me, woman? Huh?
You hear me, woman?"</i>

719
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:33,891
<i>"Sorry. Sorry, Walt. I'm sorry."</i>

720
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,322
Shit.

721
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:59,124
No! No! Damn it!

722
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,671
<i>God damn it! Fuck!</i>

723
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:53,136
<i>"There was clearly felt the presence of
a force not bound to be kind to man.</i>

724
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,933
<i>"It was a place of heathenism
and superstitious rites,</i>

725
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:02,688
<i>"to be inhabited by men
nearer of kin to the rocks</i>

726
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,440
<i>"and to the wild animals than we."</i>

727
01:30:28,091 --> 01:30:29,341
Sunni.

728
01:30:29,843 --> 01:30:32,886
Hey, Sunni! Come here, baby.

729
01:30:38,435 --> 01:30:41,061
No. No!

730
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:18,015
But now all I'm focused on
is just Alaska.

731
01:31:18,099 --> 01:31:19,683
- Yeah.
- Alaska.

732
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:24,646
<i>All right. Let's hear it for Insane Cain!</i>

733
01:31:28,109 --> 01:31:31,236
<i>Let's give it up
for Slab City's own Tracy T!</i>

734
01:31:39,954 --> 01:31:41,872
<i>Hey. My name's Tracy.</i>

735
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,749
- Tracy!
- Yeah!

736
01:32:13,822 --> 01:32:16,448
Jack London is king.

737
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:19,701
Hey, you gonna stay with us long?

738
01:32:20,495 --> 01:32:22,663
Well, I'm waiting on a check
from my last job

739
01:32:22,747 --> 01:32:25,124
to come into Salton City
the day after Christmas.

740
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:28,001
I've got to start thinking about
getting ready for Alaska.

741
01:32:28,086 --> 01:32:32,673
When the sun gets a little lower tonight,
I'm going to start a calisthenics routine.

742
01:32:33,007 --> 01:32:35,759
After the check comes in,
I think I'm gonna try to find

743
01:32:35,844 --> 01:32:39,138
some big old mountains I can climb
every day until spring comes.

744
01:32:39,222 --> 01:32:41,390
I've got to see
how far the money's gonna go.

745
01:32:41,474 --> 01:32:45,062
I've still got a lot of supplies
to pick up before spring.

746
01:32:45,897 --> 01:32:50,442
So, I might get anotherjob
or I might be okay.

747
01:32:50,986 --> 01:32:55,156
Hell, we'd give you a little something for
the days you spend in the booth here.

748
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,741
I'm not taking
any money from you, Rainey.

749
01:32:58,201 --> 01:33:01,120
It's been a real great twist
meeting you two.

750
01:33:01,204 --> 01:33:03,414
You two look like you're doing good.

751
01:33:03,707 --> 01:33:05,666
- We are doing good.
- Yeah?

752
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,959
We're doing real good.

753
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:10,671
Speaking of which, don't you think

754
01:33:10,755 --> 01:33:15,092
you ought to introduce yourself
to our little Joni Mitchell over there?

755
01:33:19,514 --> 01:33:20,514
I...

756
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,885
- Hi.
- Hi.

757
01:34:03,516 --> 01:34:05,476
You selling these books?

758
01:34:05,769 --> 01:34:08,604
I am. We are.

759
01:34:09,856 --> 01:34:11,190
He was.

760
01:34:14,945 --> 01:34:16,487
I like to read.

761
01:34:17,322 --> 01:34:19,823
- Do you?
- Yeah.

762
01:34:20,492 --> 01:34:22,326
That's good.

763
01:34:23,495 --> 01:34:27,206
I heard you play your song last night.

764
01:34:28,416 --> 01:34:33,170
- I'm terrible.
- You are not terrible. You sing sweet.

765
01:34:34,005 --> 01:34:35,339
Thank you.

766
01:34:38,718 --> 01:34:41,887
I was gonna go take a walk
to Salvation Mountain.

767
01:34:42,555 --> 01:34:45,349
- You wanna go?
- Okay.

768
01:34:53,358 --> 01:34:56,026
- Hi.
- Hi. Alex.

769
01:34:56,987 --> 01:35:02,741
I'd like to show you around up here.
I've been here since 1984, more or less.

770
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:07,290
A lot of tourists come in here

771
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:11,168
and they look at that car door up there.
They really like it.

772
01:35:12,045 --> 01:35:16,048
And I found car doors and put them
up there and I bolted it all in.

773
01:35:16,133 --> 01:35:17,633
Where did you get the telephone poles?

774
01:35:17,718 --> 01:35:20,553
A lot of people in the valley
just love me a lot.

775
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:23,222
Everybody now, I think,
in the whole world is just loving me.

776
01:35:23,307 --> 01:35:26,559
And I want to have the wisdom
to love them back.

777
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:30,187
And that's about it.
So I really get excited.

778
01:35:30,272 --> 01:35:31,981
You really believe in love, then.

779
01:35:32,065 --> 01:35:34,400
Yeah. Totally.

780
01:35:35,068 --> 01:35:39,989
This is a love story that is staggering
to everybody in the whole world.

781
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:42,908
That God really loves us a lot.

782
01:35:43,952 --> 01:35:45,453
Does that answer that?

783
01:35:45,537 --> 01:35:47,163
- Yeah.
- Good.

784
01:35:49,124 --> 01:35:53,377
I really love it here. I think the freedom
of this place is just so beautiful.

785
01:35:53,462 --> 01:35:57,423
To me, I wouldn't move for $10 million,
unless I had to.

786
01:35:59,217 --> 01:36:02,928
So I'm contented here in the desert,
and I'm living where I want to live.

787
01:36:03,138 --> 01:36:08,684
And I think good gets better.
And I think those great big tanks there

788
01:36:08,769 --> 01:36:12,396
were the sewer plant for
the Marine base in World War II.

789
01:36:14,983 --> 01:36:17,693
If you want to,
you can try putting your hands in there.

790
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:20,946
And I'm gonna do the same thing,
just for the fun.

791
01:36:21,615 --> 01:36:23,532
You're doing real good.

792
01:36:26,953 --> 01:36:30,289
You can wipe your hands off on my shirt
if you want.

793
01:36:50,644 --> 01:36:53,145
This is starting to make me hungry.

794
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:57,983
I was just a couple of years older
than Tracy when I got pregnant.

795
01:37:01,822 --> 01:37:03,447
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah.</i>

796
01:37:05,242 --> 01:37:09,370
Yeah, I thought my husband and I were
going to just make peace on Earth

797
01:37:10,163 --> 01:37:12,957
and babies and love
and stay together forever,

798
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:18,337
and that didn't quite work out that way.

799
01:37:18,422 --> 01:37:21,006
He left me.

800
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:26,889
So, I...

801
01:37:28,851 --> 01:37:29,892
Anyway, whatever,

802
01:37:29,977 --> 01:37:35,022
but I ended up raising Reno on my own.
That's my boy, his name's Reno.

803
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:38,359
Then I met Rainey.

804
01:37:39,528 --> 01:37:42,572
That was sweet.
It was really good for a while. It's just...

805
01:37:47,619 --> 01:37:52,248
You know, Reno was
a teenager already by then,

806
01:37:52,374 --> 01:37:55,543
and he was just on his way
to becoming his own man.

807
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:05,678
And I haven't even heard from him
in two years.

808
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:11,642
I don't even know where he is.

809
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:14,604
I hope I get to meet him sometime.

810
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:19,400
Do your folks know where you are?

811
01:38:24,323 --> 01:38:27,408
Hey, guys?
Dinner's ready if you guys are hungry.

812
01:38:27,493 --> 01:38:31,245
Yeah, we are. We're hungry.

813
01:38:34,791 --> 01:38:36,417
I'll be all right.

814
01:38:47,262 --> 01:38:48,971
You want to come and eat?

815
01:38:49,556 --> 01:38:52,975
Or we'll sit here.
Because I will sit here with you all night.

816
01:38:58,232 --> 01:38:59,774
Let's go. Let's go.

817
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:04,487
Guys, come on. It's getting cold.

818
01:39:08,116 --> 01:39:13,287
Check this out. Tawdry?
Denise, that sounds like your cup of tea.

819
01:39:43,068 --> 01:39:47,073
That poor girl is about ready
to vault herself onto a fence post.

820
01:39:47,908 --> 01:39:52,245
And here you are,
the monk of Jack fucking LaLanne.

821
01:39:59,128 --> 01:40:03,172
- So Jan talked to you about Reno, huh?
- Yeah.

822
01:40:06,176 --> 01:40:09,887
Children can be pretty harsh
when it comes to their parents.

823
01:40:10,431 --> 01:40:12,640
You planning on seeing yours?

824
01:40:14,893 --> 01:40:17,228
I've only got one plan, Rainey.

825
01:40:18,314 --> 01:40:20,982
That would be Alaska?

826
01:40:21,191 --> 01:40:22,609
Alaska.

827
01:40:34,121 --> 01:40:35,288
Hello?

828
01:40:36,957 --> 01:40:40,001
- Merry Christmas.
- Come in here.

829
01:40:49,136 --> 01:40:51,220
My parents went into town.

830
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:53,890
No.

831
01:40:54,224 --> 01:40:57,393
Yeah. They went to call my grandma
for Christmas.

832
01:40:58,062 --> 01:41:00,229
No, I mean we can't do that.

833
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,690
Why not?

834
01:41:09,907 --> 01:41:11,491
How old are you?

835
01:41:12,409 --> 01:41:13,701
Eighteen.

836
01:41:16,789 --> 01:41:18,289
Seventeen.

837
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:22,085
What year were you born?

838
01:41:28,926 --> 01:41:30,593
So I'm 16.

839
01:41:44,692 --> 01:41:47,110
You want to do something together?

840
01:43:01,103 --> 01:43:05,774
You can send mail to this address
in South Dakota.

841
01:43:07,401 --> 01:43:11,780
I don't know when I'm going to get it,
but I'll get it.

842
01:43:16,076 --> 01:43:17,869
You're pretty magic.

843
01:43:17,953 --> 01:43:20,622
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

844
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:24,209
And just remember

845
01:43:24,585 --> 01:43:29,088
if you want something in life,
reach out and grab it.

846
01:43:50,402 --> 01:43:52,445
- You take care, kiddo.
- You, too.

847
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:57,826
- New Year's resolution?
- We'll work on it.

848
01:45:05,646 --> 01:45:08,481
Just get your pack
and get on out of here, okay?

849
01:45:09,609 --> 01:45:11,985
I don't think I could take a hug.

850
01:45:26,667 --> 01:45:27,667
Hey.

851
01:45:40,264 --> 01:45:41,348
Bye!

852
01:45:56,197 --> 01:46:00,784
<i>A year and a half had passed in what
Dad called "suspended animation."</i>

853
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:14,214
<i>The weight of Chris' disappearance had
begun to lay down on me full-length.</i>

854
01:46:25,601 --> 01:46:27,852
"I have lived through much,

855
01:46:28,896 --> 01:46:32,649
"and now I think I have found what is
needed for happiness.

856
01:46:36,445 --> 01:46:39,197
"A quiet secluded life in the country,

857
01:46:41,075 --> 01:46:45,831
"with the possibility of being useful to
people to whom it is easy to do good,

858
01:46:47,583 --> 01:46:51,086
"and who are not accustomed
to have it done to them.

859
01:46:52,922 --> 01:46:56,049
<i>"And work which one hopes
may be of some use.</i>

860
01:46:57,677 --> 01:47:02,014
"Then rest, nature, books, music,

861
01:47:02,724 --> 01:47:04,766
"love for one's neighbor.

862
01:47:08,688 --> 01:47:11,148
"Such is my idea of happiness.

863
01:47:14,068 --> 01:47:20,657
<i>"And then, on top of all that,
you for a mate,</i>

864
01:47:21,826 --> 01:47:23,785
<i>"and children perhaps.</i>

865
01:47:25,663 --> 01:47:28,498
<i>"What more
can the heart of a man desire?"</i>

866
01:47:36,799 --> 01:47:41,219
<i>Comes the morning when I can feel</i>

867
01:47:41,304 --> 01:47:45,682
<i>That there's nothing
left to be concealed</i>

868
01:47:45,767 --> 01:47:50,228
<i>Moving on
A scene surreal</i>

869
01:47:50,313 --> 01:47:56,401
<i>But my heart will never
Never be far from here</i>

870
01:47:56,486 --> 01:48:00,781
<i>Sure as I'm breathing
Sure as I'm sad</i>

871
01:48:00,865 --> 01:48:05,368
<i>I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh</i>

872
01:48:05,453 --> 01:48:10,082
<i>I leave here believing
More than I had</i>

873
01:48:10,166 --> 01:48:13,835
<i>And there's a reason I will</i>

874
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:18,131
<i>A reason I'll be back</i>

875
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:26,098
<i>As I walk the hemisphere</i>

876
01:48:26,182 --> 01:48:30,560
<i>I got my wish to up and disappear</i>

877
01:48:30,645 --> 01:48:34,981
<i>I've been wounded
I've been healed</i>

878
01:48:35,066 --> 01:48:38,193
<i>Now for landing I've been</i>

879
01:48:38,277 --> 01:48:41,196
<i>Landing I've been cleared</i>

880
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:45,826
<i>Sure as I'm breathing
Sure as I'm sad</i>

881
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:50,288
<i>I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh</i>

882
01:48:50,373 --> 01:48:54,793
<i>I leave here believing
More than I had</i>

883
01:48:54,877 --> 01:48:58,922
<i>This love has got no ceiling</i>

884
01:52:06,614 --> 01:52:08,282
Where's your camp?

885
01:52:09,075 --> 01:52:11,618
Just out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.

886
01:52:12,412 --> 01:52:15,539
I've lived in and around here
for six years now

887
01:52:16,082 --> 01:52:18,167
and I've never heard of any place
that goes by that name.

888
01:52:18,251 --> 01:52:21,211
- Show me how to get there.
- Yeah.

889
01:52:24,841 --> 01:52:27,468
- Ron Franz.
- Alex.

890
01:52:27,594 --> 01:52:29,428
Alex? Where you from, Alex?

891
01:52:30,347 --> 01:52:34,350
- West Virginia.
- Okay, Alex from West Virginia.

892
01:53:19,396 --> 01:53:24,149
Well, this is something out here.

893
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:30,280
Don't you...

894
01:53:31,282 --> 01:53:35,994
Don't you worry about those dope
smokers and nudists down below there?

895
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:39,915
No, they keep to themselves
pretty much.

896
01:53:39,999 --> 01:53:43,295
You strike me as a bright young man.
Am I wrong about that?

897
01:53:44,506 --> 01:53:46,924
I think I've got
my head on my shoulders pretty good.

898
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:48,759
Well, that's what I mean.

899
01:53:53,432 --> 01:53:55,516
How long you been out here?

900
01:53:57,144 --> 01:54:00,354
- Couple of weeks.
- And before that?

901
01:54:00,856 --> 01:54:04,024
A lot of places.
Been moving around a lot.

902
01:54:05,152 --> 01:54:08,362
- Well, how old are you?
- Twenty-three.

903
01:54:09,281 --> 01:54:10,531
Twenty-three years old!

904
01:54:10,615 --> 01:54:13,617
Son, don't you think
you ought to be getting an education?

905
01:54:13,702 --> 01:54:16,704
And a job?
And making something of this life?

906
01:54:19,916 --> 01:54:21,542
Look, Mr. Franz,

907
01:54:22,711 --> 01:54:26,589
I think careers are a 20th century
invention, and I don't want one.

908
01:54:27,549 --> 01:54:31,385
You don't need to worry about me.
I have a college education.

909
01:54:31,636 --> 01:54:35,806
I'm not destitute.
I'm living like this by choice.

910
01:54:37,476 --> 01:54:41,854
- In the dirt?
- Yeah, in the dirt.

911
01:54:46,151 --> 01:54:49,862
- Where's your family?
- Don't have one anymore.

912
01:54:53,241 --> 01:54:54,742
That's a shame.

913
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:00,789
Hey, Mr. Franz,
I want to show you something.

914
01:55:01,541 --> 01:55:06,629
Come on.

915
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:37,660
It's getting a little steep.
A little high for me, kid.

916
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:40,663
All right,

917
01:55:41,957 --> 01:55:45,251
but even from halfway out,
it's quite a sight, isn't it?

918
01:55:47,295 --> 01:55:52,132
From the top, you can see all the way
to the Salton Sea, too.

919
01:55:52,801 --> 01:55:55,219
You can see the Salton Sea
from up there?

920
01:55:55,512 --> 01:55:56,804
Yes, sir.

921
01:55:57,597 --> 01:55:58,973
My goodness.

922
01:56:00,058 --> 01:56:04,897
- You don't want to go up?
- Nope. I don't do these kind of things.

923
01:56:08,485 --> 01:56:10,903
I spent most of my life in the Army.

924
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:18,494
New Year's Eve, 1957,
I was stationed in Okinawa.

925
01:56:19,997 --> 01:56:24,000
My wife and son were here in the States
just driving down the road,

926
01:56:24,084 --> 01:56:27,628
and some fella who'd had too much
to drink plowed right into them.

927
01:56:28,171 --> 01:56:30,172
Killed them both.

928
01:56:34,553 --> 01:56:39,682
Now you might think
the last thing I would do in the world

929
01:56:42,519 --> 01:56:44,312
is go to the whiskey.

930
01:56:46,023 --> 01:56:50,234
But at the time,
it felt like the only thing I could do.

931
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:52,945
And I did it hard!

932
01:56:55,949 --> 01:56:58,451
But pretty soon I realized

933
01:56:59,202 --> 01:57:03,456
I wasn't doing my wife and son any good
mourning them with the bottle.

934
01:57:03,832 --> 01:57:07,877
So I pulled myself together
and I quit drinking,

935
01:57:08,545 --> 01:57:09,920
cold turkey.

936
01:57:11,214 --> 01:57:15,593
So since all that, this is pretty much me.

937
01:57:16,887 --> 01:57:19,138
Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?

938
01:57:20,182 --> 01:57:23,267
No, I can't seem to get too far
from my leather.

939
01:57:24,978 --> 01:57:29,565
I do a lot of leather engraving.
I got a little workshop out in the garage.

940
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:32,109
Between that and my pension,
I do pretty well.

941
01:57:32,194 --> 01:57:34,737
But every time I think
I might take a trip somewhere,

942
01:57:34,821 --> 01:57:38,449
I get too far behind on orders and such
to consider it.

943
01:57:39,326 --> 01:57:41,994
When we finish eating,
I'd love to see your workshop.

944
01:57:42,079 --> 01:57:43,496
- Would you?
- Oh, yeah.

945
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:45,373
I was hoping you'd say that.

946
01:57:45,457 --> 01:57:48,417
- It's amazing how malleable this is.
- Yeah, it is.

947
01:57:48,502 --> 01:57:50,211
When the leather is wet you can really...

948
01:57:50,295 --> 01:57:51,629
- It's like butter.
- Yeah.

949
01:57:51,713 --> 01:57:55,257
It's amazing. And then it hardens up,
and, I mean, it stays right there.

950
01:58:40,305 --> 01:58:45,977
A good whack with the mallet.
Crack it down. Whack. Bang.

951
01:59:46,330 --> 01:59:49,999
I went to South Dakota.
I worked at a grain elevator

952
01:59:50,083 --> 01:59:52,627
for this guy named Wayne.
He was a really good guy.

953
01:59:52,711 --> 01:59:54,295
So I took the Colorado River

954
01:59:54,379 --> 01:59:57,673
all the way down through
the Grand Canyon and did rapids,

955
01:59:57,758 --> 02:00:01,385
which is by far one of
the scariest things I've ever done.

956
02:00:01,512 --> 02:00:06,891
And I took the Colorado down into
Mexico, Golfo, where I got stuck.

957
02:00:07,768 --> 02:00:10,102
Salvation Mountain. The Slabs.

958
02:00:11,814 --> 02:00:13,940
What's the "N" stand for?

959
02:00:15,567 --> 02:00:16,734
North.

960
02:00:18,028 --> 02:00:19,695
Alaska?

961
02:00:22,699 --> 02:00:25,201
Son, what the hell
are you running from?

962
02:00:26,328 --> 02:00:28,788
You know, I can ask you
the same question!

963
02:00:29,832 --> 02:00:32,250
Except I already know the answer!

964
02:00:33,085 --> 02:00:34,585
You do, do you?

965
02:00:35,337 --> 02:00:39,590
I do, Mr. Franz!
You got to get back out in the world!

966
02:00:40,386 --> 02:00:43,596
Get out of that lonely house,
that little workshop of yours.

967
02:00:43,681 --> 02:00:47,725
Get back out on the road! Really!

968
02:00:48,602 --> 02:00:51,229
You're going to live a long time, Ron!

969
02:00:51,313 --> 02:00:54,607
You should make a radical change
in your lifestyle!

970
02:00:55,276 --> 02:00:59,195
I mean, the core of man's spirit
comes from new experiences.

971
02:00:59,738 --> 02:01:03,950
And there you are, stubborn old man,
sitting on your butt.

972
02:01:05,077 --> 02:01:07,912
- Sitting on my butt?
- Yeah.

973
02:01:09,456 --> 02:01:13,877
I'll show you sitting on my butt!

974
02:01:13,961 --> 02:01:16,004
"Stubborn old man."

975
02:01:17,464 --> 02:01:19,132
I'll show you!

976
02:01:19,633 --> 02:01:21,843
Come on, then! Come on.

977
02:01:24,805 --> 02:01:27,932
Sitting on my butt? Yeah.

978
02:01:30,019 --> 02:01:32,186
Come on, old man. Come climbing.

979
02:01:32,271 --> 02:01:33,980
Sitting on my butt.

980
02:01:34,315 --> 02:01:35,815
Come on. Keep going!

981
02:01:39,653 --> 02:01:41,362
You're doing great!

982
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:48,828
- Keep going. Keep going, Ron!
- Yeah!

983
02:01:50,581 --> 02:01:54,334
Can anybody see this?
God, are you watching this right now?

984
02:02:02,509 --> 02:02:03,635
Yeah.

985
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:11,017
- You all right?
- You little pinhead!

986
02:02:28,535 --> 02:02:30,870
I'm gonna miss you when you go.

987
02:02:32,498 --> 02:02:36,167
I'll miss you, too, Ron.
But you're wrong if you think

988
02:02:36,251 --> 02:02:40,213
that the joy of life comes principally
from human relationships.

989
02:02:41,215 --> 02:02:43,549
God's placed it all around us.
It's in everything.

990
02:02:43,634 --> 02:02:46,010
It's in anything we can experience.

991
02:02:46,887 --> 02:02:50,390
People just need to change the way
they look at those things.

992
02:02:50,474 --> 02:02:52,684
Yeah, I'm gonna take stock of that.

993
02:02:54,561 --> 02:02:55,853
No, I am.

994
02:03:00,069 --> 02:03:01,152
I am.

995
02:03:03,531 --> 02:03:05,740
But I wanted to tell you something.

996
02:03:09,495 --> 02:03:12,247
From the bits and pieces I put together,

997
02:03:12,331 --> 02:03:16,418
you know, from what you told me about
your family, your mother and your dad.

998
02:03:18,421 --> 02:03:21,756
And I know you've got your problems
with the church, too.

999
02:03:23,676 --> 02:03:27,429
But there's some kind of bigger thing
we can all appreciate,

1000
02:03:28,431 --> 02:03:31,641
and it sounds like
you don't mind calling it God.

1001
02:03:37,732 --> 02:03:40,650
But when you forgive,

1002
02:03:42,903 --> 02:03:44,154
you love.

1003
02:03:47,908 --> 02:03:50,952
And when you love,

1004
02:03:51,787 --> 02:03:54,372
God's light shines on you.

1005
02:03:59,086 --> 02:04:02,797
- Holy shit.
- I told you about that language.

1006
02:04:12,975 --> 02:04:14,476
I told you so!

1007
02:04:17,354 --> 02:04:20,899
Where are the fucking animals now?
I'm hungry!

1008
02:04:21,025 --> 02:04:25,236
I'm fucking hungry! I'm fucking hungry!

1009
02:04:42,296 --> 02:04:46,049
<i>"For a moment she rediscovered
the purpose of her life.</i>

1010
02:04:46,926 --> 02:04:50,637
<i>"She was here on earth to grasp
the meaning of its wild enchantment,</i>

1011
02:04:50,721 --> 02:04:53,556
<i>"and to call each thing
by its right name."</i>

1012
02:04:56,852 --> 02:04:58,520
"By its right name."

1013
02:04:59,313 --> 02:05:01,648
What is this? What is this one?

1014
02:05:04,693 --> 02:05:09,656
<i>This is Viburnum edule.
Viburnum edule.</i>

1015
02:05:14,495 --> 02:05:17,497
<i>Hedysarum alpinum.</i>

1016
02:05:19,585 --> 02:05:24,297
Hedysarum alpinum is wild potato root.
Wild potato root.

1017
02:05:26,551 --> 02:05:30,220
<i>Epilobium angustifolium. Fireweed.</i>

1018
02:08:25,606 --> 02:08:28,525
Fuck it all. Fuck it all!

1019
02:11:06,936 --> 02:11:07,978
Hi.

1020
02:11:08,062 --> 02:11:11,231
What are you doing up?
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1021
02:11:11,566 --> 02:11:14,776
I heard you get off the couch
about a half hour ago.

1022
02:11:16,070 --> 02:11:19,781
Had a funny feeling
you might not be here for our breakfast.

1023
02:11:23,995 --> 02:11:28,916
I'm gonna drive you 100 miles to
someplace where you can catch a train,

1024
02:11:29,667 --> 02:11:34,379
a plane or hitch a ride
and not get stuck out in this desert.

1025
02:11:35,590 --> 02:11:39,593
I'd take you all the way to Alaska
if I didn't have an 8:00 mass.

1026
02:11:39,928 --> 02:11:43,347
- Ron, you don't have to do that.
- I want to do it.

1027
02:11:44,224 --> 02:11:47,226
Get you started on this thing of yours.

1028
02:11:47,685 --> 02:11:49,728
- On my great...
- I know.

1029
02:11:50,396 --> 02:11:52,940
On your great Alaskan adventure.

1030
02:11:53,733 --> 02:11:56,443
Here. Here's a machete.

1031
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:03,617
Collapsible fishing pole, a few other
odds and ends I stuck in there for you.

1032
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:09,498
- Ron...
- Just take it.

1033
02:12:10,875 --> 02:12:13,710
I'll get dressed
and meet you in the truck.

1034
02:13:09,978 --> 02:13:11,604
Well, my friend.

1035
02:13:14,065 --> 02:13:15,149
Yep.

1036
02:13:19,529 --> 02:13:22,031
I had an idea.

1037
02:13:23,158 --> 02:13:27,828
You know, my mother was an only child

1038
02:13:28,705 --> 02:13:30,539
and so was my father,

1039
02:13:31,166 --> 02:13:35,461
and I was their only child,

1040
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:41,550
so when I'm gone,
I'm the end of the line.

1041
02:13:42,594 --> 02:13:44,720
My family will be finished.

1042
02:13:48,391 --> 02:13:53,729
What do you say you let me adopt you?

1043
02:13:58,068 --> 02:14:02,196
I can be, say, your grandfather.

1044
02:14:06,576 --> 02:14:08,202
Ron,

1045
02:14:09,788 --> 02:14:13,582
could we talk about this
when I get back from Alaska?

1046
02:14:13,958 --> 02:14:15,751
Would that be okay?

1047
02:14:23,051 --> 02:14:26,261
Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Yeah.

1048
02:14:31,226 --> 02:14:32,559
All right, Ron.

1049
02:14:34,938 --> 02:14:36,271
Thank you.

1050
02:15:25,407 --> 02:15:27,616
<i>What did his voice sound like now?</i>

1051
02:15:28,869 --> 02:15:31,078
<i>What would he tell about now?</i>

1052
02:15:31,538 --> 02:15:34,665
...nine, ten.

1053
02:16:24,299 --> 02:16:29,261
<i>I realized that the words to my thoughts
were of less and less meaning.</i>

1054
02:16:29,346 --> 02:16:31,472
<i>Chris was writing his story,</i>

1055
02:16:32,933 --> 02:16:35,935
<i>and it had to be Chris who would tell it.</i>

1056
02:18:56,703 --> 02:18:59,163
<i>"To call each thing by its right name.</i>

1057
02:19:04,044 --> 02:19:05,753
<i>"By its right name."</i>

1058
02:19:56,932 --> 02:19:58,975
<i>What if I were smiling</i>

1059
02:20:01,437 --> 02:20:03,771
<i>and running into your arms?</i>

1060
02:20:26,378 --> 02:20:28,129
<i>Would you see then</i>
