1
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,739
Hey, buddy.

2
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,769
You don't waste time, do you?

3
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,473
I try not to.

4
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:50,845
Well, you need help?

5
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:51,941
Sure.

6
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:57,746
Would you like to tell us

7
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,781
what the hell that was all about?

8
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,086
I don't like good-byes.

9
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,924
Kind of the point of
a good-bye party, John.

10
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,487
Went to a certain amount
of trouble, you know?

11
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:09,000
Could've at least stayed
a few minutes, huh?

12
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:12,936
Eaten some of the food
we so feverishly prepared?

13
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,495
I apologize, Harry.

14
00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:16,096
But why are you moving so quickly?

15
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,267
You only resigned a couple of days ago.

16
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,369
You got the history chair at Stanford.

17
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:21,436
I wish.

18
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:23,640
Well, taquitos, chicken wings,

19
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:25,546
Roastie-Toasties and beer.

20
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:27,346
If we'd had more time,

21
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,444
we'd have done something
a little more grandiose.

22
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:31,216
Candlelight dinner at McDonald's.

23
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,746
Strippers.

24
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,622
Taquitos are fine.

25
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,525
A'right.

26
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,323
Art's gonna be along, too.

27
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,159
He's, uh, talking to a student. Pfft.

28
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,029
Is George taking over for you?

29
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:44,762
- George or Trimbell.
- Has the dean made up his mind?

30
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:45,861
He hasn't called.

31
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:46,870
My god!

32
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:48,338
Wh-What is this?

33
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:49,635
It looks like a Van Gogh,

34
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:51,108
But I've never seen it before.

35
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:52,542
Is that an original, John?

36
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,876
No, it's just a gift someone gave me.

37
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,881
Still, it's a superb copy.

38
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,849
Contemporaneous, I think,

39
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:00,784
May I take a closer look?

40
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:01,820
Please, yeah.

41
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:06,649
Yeah, it's the same
stretcher as Van Gogh used.

42
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:09,252
Yeah, there's writing
on the back in French.

43
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,694
Oh, "to my friend Jacques Borne."

44
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,890
Wonder who that was?

45
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,397
Someone he knew, I guess.

46
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,092
Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.

47
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:19,069
Surely you'll have this
looked at, appraised?

48
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:21,038
Well, maybe sometime,

49
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:24,337
but I wouldn't really want money for it.

50
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:28,005
That does it.

51
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:29,910
Put that stuff in the kitchen.

52
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:33,440
No, I'm gonna put it
in the bathroom, John.

53
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,714
Gas is off, electricity's on.

54
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:38,912
Get comfortable while you can.

55
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:41,492
The furniture's going this afternoon.

56
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,995
It's been years since I sat on a floor.

57
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,929
Heh. I can't remember her name.

58
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:47,556
Eh, it's good for the back.

59
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,464
Can we do yoga exercises?

60
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,332
Tantric yoga, we can.

61
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:55,298
So you're leaving
good old "we teach you."

62
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,366
Rather suddenly, you must admit.

63
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:00,035
Truth time, John.

64
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:01,636
Is there a problem?

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,977
No.

66
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,208
Oh, come on, you know we wanna help.

67
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:07,411
That's appreciated, but really-

68
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:09,454
There's no problem.

69
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,046
Well, now I am curious.

70
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,351
Where are you going?

71
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,585
Givin' up tenure...

72
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:15,592
A decade of professorship,

73
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:18,026
in line to chain the department,

74
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:20,929
and you don't know where you're going?

75
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,398
Call it cabin fever.

76
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,925
After a while, I get itchy feet.

77
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:26,197
I've done this before.

78
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:29,331
No, no, no, you're too young
to have done this before.

79
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,638
And he hasn't aged a day in ten years.

80
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,143
Every woman on the faculty

81
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,737
would give anything to have that secret.

82
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:37,372
Is that what they're after, Edith?

83
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,043
Oh, stop, Harry.

84
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,445
Wow, can you pull this?

85
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,452
What the hell?

86
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:47,787
What do you hunt?

87
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:49,020
Deer, mostly.

88
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,221
Around big bear.

89
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,627
With a bow and arrow?

90
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,358
Most people can't bag a deer

91
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,423
with a rifle and a telescopic sight.

92
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,025
Though, good eatin'.

93
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,559
The best wild game.

94
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,195
Lives naturally, eats naturally.

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,706
Well, it's beautiful.

96
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,571
Art.

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,872
Ah.

98
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,180
So, can I get an "a" for awesome?

99
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,207
Oh, my gosh.

100
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,987
That was fun.

101
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:18,421
Hey, John.

102
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,924
You know Linda.
You had her last semester.

103
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,290
Hi. Hey.

104
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,227
She's one of my victims now.
I'm taking her home.

105
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:26,127
She wanted to come by
and say hello good-bye.

106
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:27,597
Is Art as tough as I hear?

107
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,998
Oh, archaeology's tough.

108
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,025
Dr. Jenkins is a fine teacher.

109
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,037
Oh, that's very politic.

110
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:34,595
It's very true. Uh-huh.

111
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,108
Something for you to
read on the road, pal.

112
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:40,043
"Shadows of the cave:
parallels to early man."

113
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,477
M. Jenkins.

114
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:42,673
Publish or perish.

115
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:43,806
I'd rather read

116
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:44,941
than write another one.

117
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,848
Thank you.

118
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,112
Hi.

119
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,415
Oh, everybody, this is Linda.

120
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:52,685
Linda, this is everybody.

121
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:54,248
Linda. Hi.

122
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:56,521
So.

123
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,052
Where you going, John,
like we give a damn?

124
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:00,257
We've already covered that.

125
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:02,664
John's got itchy feet.

126
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,999
There are over-the-counter
remedies for that, John.

127
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:09,270
So there is a problem.

128
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,071
No.

129
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:13,407
I just like to move on now and then.

130
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:14,775
It's a personal thing.

131
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:18,272
Well, not to pry.

132
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:28,691
I'm sorry I don't
have more to offer you.

133
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:31,252
Got conversation, some
seats for your behinds,

134
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,320
And, uh...

135
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,592
Is he ducking out on us again?

136
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,699
...I do have this.

137
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,336
Oh ho ho! Johnny Walker green!

138
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:49,175
Didn't even
know they made it in green.

139
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:50,613
What do they pay you?

140
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,616
Nothing is too good for my friends.

141
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:55,620
But I'm sorry-
we are down to plastic cups now.

142
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,622
That's a sacrilege I'll tolerate.

143
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,283
I will do the honors.

144
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:00,951
Oh, come to papa.

145
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:03,984
Ooh! Here, cups, cups.

146
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,051
There we go.

147
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,189
Step on in here.

148
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:07,253
There ya go...

149
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,767
One for the birthday boy
- Excuse me. Art?

150
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,859
No, not for me.

151
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,266
Oh, no, I don't drink.

152
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,362
We're not
gonna card you, darling.

153
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,397
All right, here, join
the circle at least.

154
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:21,105
Well, to long life and good fortune

155
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:22,669
To our esteemed friend

156
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,614
and colleague, John Oldman.

157
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,548
May he find undeserved bliss

158
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:27,779
wherever he goes.

159
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:28,786
Hear, hear.

160
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,685
Skol. Na zdorovye.

161
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,587
One off the top, John.

162
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,425
Mm! Oh, that's good.

163
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:40,624
Excuse me.

164
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:46,235
John, we're all sorry to see you go.

165
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,328
Truly.

166
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,900
Okay. Now we're done with that,

167
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,978
what do we do for the
rest of the afternoon?

168
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,775
Anyone got a good topic?

169
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,577
Like this, maybe? Heh.

170
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:58,605
What is that?

171
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,312
It's a burin off a parrot beak.

172
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,150
Inclined chisel point...

173
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,213
Probably early Magdalenian.

174
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,248
May I see that?
Sure.

175
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,094
Yes indeed, that's what it is.

176
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:17,494
What's a burin?

177
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,161
A burin is a flint tool

178
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,796
for grooving wood and
bone, antlers especially,

179
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:24,307
to make spear and harpoon points.

180
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,367
Magdalenians weren't
noted for flint work,

181
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:28,140
so this is a very nice specimen.

182
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,648
Okay, what's a Magdalenian?

183
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:32,081
A later Cro-Magnon,

184
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,379
without gettin' technical.

185
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,579
It's the final culture
of the upper Paleolithic.

186
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:38,384
If stones could speak, eh, Art?

187
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,118
So where'd you get that, John?

188
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,717
Believe it or not, from a thrift shop.
A quarter.

189
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,284
You lucky dog!

190
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,626
I gotta go digging
for this kind of stuff.

191
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:47,824
Can I, uh?

192
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:48,888
Yeah.

193
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,430
Huh.

194
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,137
Maybe...

195
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:01,679
I'm glad you did this.

196
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:04,544
Did what? You mean come over?

197
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,244
Maybe?

198
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,579
Definitely.

199
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:08,949
Gee, thanks.

200
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,284
Well, so are we.

201
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,686
So are we.

202
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,883
We couldn't let you just run off.

203
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,085
Thanks.

204
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,857
John, what is up, huh?

205
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,431
Are you on America's most wanted?

206
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:21,557
We won't turn you in.

207
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,997
Yeah, come on, out with it.

208
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,000
You're among friends.

209
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,263
Snoopy friends.

210
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:26,270
Forget it.

211
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:27,963
You are creating the mystery here.

212
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:30,304
Obviously, you have something
you'd like to say. Say it!

213
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,569
Well, maybe I...

214
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:35,941
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

215
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,005
Harry, stop.

216
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,384
There is something I'm
tempted to tell you, I think.

217
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,014
I've never done this before,
and I wonder how it'll pan out.

218
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:50,491
I wonder if I could ask
you a silly question.

219
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,496
John, we're teachers.

220
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,464
We answer silly questions all the time.

221
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,522
Hey!

222
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:58,262
What if a man from the upper Paleolithic

223
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,100
survived until the present day?

224
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:01,833
What do you mean, survived?

225
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,135
Never died?

226
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,267
Yes. What would he be like?

227
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:06,776
Well, I know some guys.

228
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,642
You ever been to the Ozarks?

229
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,443
It's an interesting idea.

230
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,973
What, are you working on
a science fiction story?

231
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,246
Say I am. What would he be like?

232
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,549
Pretty tired.

233
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:20,185
Well, seriously,

234
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,419
As Art's book title suggests,

235
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,587
he might be like any of us.

236
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:25,857
Dan. A caveman?

237
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,727
Well, there's no anatomical difference

238
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,495
between, say, a Cro-Magnon and us.

239
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,968
Except that as a rule,
we've grown taller.

240
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:34,301
What's the selective
advantage of height?

241
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:37,102
Better to see predators
in tall grass, my dear.

242
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,370
Actually, tall and skinny

243
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:42,310
radiates heat more
effectively in warmer climates.

244
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,574
And as for Neanderthals,

245
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,343
I mean, we've all seen apish people.

246
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:46,577
That strain's still with us.

247
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,711
But he'd be a caveman.

248
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:49,719
No, he wouldn't.

249
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:50,777
John's hypothetical man

250
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,585
would have lived
through 140 centuries...

251
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:53,989
Yeah, roughly.

252
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:56,391
...and changed with every one of them.

253
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,726
I mean, assuming normal intelligence.

254
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,265
Well, we think men of
the upper Paleolithic

255
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,130
were as intelligent as we are.

256
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:04,896
They just didn't know as much.

257
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,938
John's man would have
learned as the race learned.

258
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:11,100
In fact, if he had an inquiring mind,

259
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:14,202
his knowledge might be astonishing.

260
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,509
If you do write that,
let me have a look at it.

261
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,743
I'm sure you'll make some
anthropological boners.

262
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:19,841
It's a deal.

263
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,749
What would keep him alive?

264
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,617
What does the biologist say?

265
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,247
Cigarettes.

266
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,120
And ice cream.

267
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,217
All right, all right, I'll play.

268
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:32,990
All right, um, in science fiction terms,

269
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,658
I would say...

270
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:40,000
Perfect regeneration
of the body's cells,

271
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:42,131
especially in the vital organs.

272
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,038
Actually, the human
body appears designed

273
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,134
to live about 190 years.

274
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:50,011
Most of us just die of slow poisoning.

275
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,538
Maybe he did something right,

276
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,882
something everybody else
in history had done wrong.

277
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,284
What, like eat the food,

278
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,345
drink the water, and breathe the air?

279
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,324
Prior to modern times,

280
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,189
those were pristine.

281
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:06,687
We've extended our lifespan
in a world that's, uh...

282
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,596
not fit to live in.

283
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,100
You know, it could happen.

284
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:12,433
The pancreas turns over
cells every 24 hours,

285
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,062
the stomach lining in three days,

286
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,663
the entire body in seven years,

287
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:17,197
but the process falters.

288
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:20,072
Waste accumulates, eventually
proves fatal to function.

289
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:22,739
Now if a quirk in his immune system

290
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,509
led to perfect detox,

291
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:26,517
perfect renewal, then yeah.

292
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:28,746
He could duck decay.

293
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,050
Mm, that's a secret
we'd all love to have.

294
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:34,023
Would you really want to do that?

295
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,924
Live 14,000 years?

296
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:38,757
Well, if I could stay
healthy and I didn't age,

297
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,922
I mean, why not?

298
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,158
Yeah. What a chance to learn.

299
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:45,031
Is anyone hungry?

300
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,937
You know, the more I think
about it, yeah, it's possible.

301
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,530
Anything is possible, right?

302
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,839
After all, one century's magic,
another century's science.

303
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:55,004
They thought Columbus
was a nut job, right?

304
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:56,070
Pasteur, Copernicus?

305
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,774
Aristarchus long before that.

306
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:58,873
Right.

307
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,180
I had a chance to sail with Columbus,

308
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,585
Only I'm not the adventurous type.

309
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:06,556
I was pretty sure the Earth was round,

310
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:09,321
but at that point, I still thought

311
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:12,090
he might fall off an edge someplace...

312
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,406
Look around, John.

313
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,807
We just did.

314
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,210
I suppose there's a
joke in there somewhere,

315
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,508
but I don't get it.

316
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,412
There's nothing to get.

317
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:33,212
What are we talking about?

318
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,183
We were just talking about a caveman

319
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,586
who survives until the present time.

320
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,954
As you said, what a chance to learn,

321
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,423
once I learned to learn.

322
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:45,619
Did you start the whiskey
before we got here?

323
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:50,600
Pretend it's science fiction.

324
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,364
Figure it out.

325
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:56,931
Okay, a-
- Very old Cro-Magnon

326
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,533
living until the present.

327
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,011
Oh!

328
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,275
What?

329
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:11,253
John just confided that
he's 14,000 years old.

330
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:14,884
Oh, John, you don't look a day over 900.

331
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,120
Okay, okay.

332
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:17,923
All right, Spock, I'll
play your little game.

333
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:20,624
What do you want? What's the punch line?

334
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:23,326
Every ten years or so, when people start

335
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,096
to notice I don't age, I move on.

336
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:30,105
That's very good,
that's very quick, John.

337
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,541
I wanna read that
story when you're done.

338
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,043
You want more?

339
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,977
By all means. This is great.

340
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,003
All right, now...

341
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:40,710
So you think that you are a...

342
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:41,810
A, uh, Cro-Magnon.

343
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,411
Well, I didn't learn it in school.

344
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,115
That's my best guess,

345
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:49,660
based on archaeological data,
maps, anthropological research.

346
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,024
Since Mesopotamia,

347
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,257
I've got the last...
4,000 years straight.

348
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:57,426
You're ahead of most
people, so please, go on.

349
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,026
Well, you know the background stuff,

350
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,469
so I'll make it brief.

351
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,938
In what I call my first lifetime,

352
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:04,669
I aged to about 35...

353
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,301
what you see.

354
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,504
I ended up leading my group.

355
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,377
They saw me as magical.

356
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:13,407
I didn't even have to fight for it.

357
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:16,351
Then fear came, and they chased me away.

358
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:17,877
They thought that I was

359
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:20,254
stealing their lives away to stay young.

360
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,589
The prehistoric origin
of the vampire myth.

361
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:23,525
That is good!

362
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:24,584
First thousand years,

363
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:26,721
I didn't know up from sideways.

364
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,232
How do you know the
first thousand years?

365
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,790
An informed guess, based on what

366
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,302
I've learned in my memories.

367
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,396
Most people can scarcely
remember their childhood,

368
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,498
but you have memories of that time?

369
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,099
Like yours, selective.

370
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:41,509
You know, the high points,
the low points, traumas.

371
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,241
They stick in the mind forever.

372
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:47,216
Put down at 3 or 35,
you still feel a twinge.

373
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,018
Go on.

374
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:54,081
I kept getting chased
because I wouldn't die,

375
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,526
so I got the hang of
joining new groups I found.

376
00:14:57,562 --> 00:15:00,929
I also got the idea of
periodically moving on.

377
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:03,456
We were semi-nomadic, of course,

378
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:06,503
following the weather
and the game we hunted.

379
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,471
The first 2,000 years were cold.

380
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,133
We learned it was warmer
at lower elevations.

381
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,769
Late glacial period, I assume.

382
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:16,371
What was the terrain like?

383
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:19,508
Mountainous.

384
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,484
Vast plains to the west.

385
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:25,588
West - something you learned in school.

386
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:28,183
Towards the setting sun.

387
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,591
I suspect I saw the British isles

388
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,926
from what is now the French coast.

389
00:15:32,997 --> 00:15:34,589
Huge mountains...

390
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:37,362
on the other side of
an enormous deep valley

391
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,302
that was shadowed by the setting sun.

392
00:15:39,337 --> 00:15:41,202
This is before they were separated

393
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:43,833
from the continent by rising
seas, as glaciers melted.

394
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,442
That happened?

395
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:48,638
Yes, the end of the Pleistocene.

396
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:50,704
So far, what he says fits.

397
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,773
Oh, yeah, into any textbook.

398
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,751
And that's where I found it.

399
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,684
How can I have knowledgeable recall

400
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,552
if I didn't have knowledge?

401
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,557
It's all retrospective.

402
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,025
All I can do is
integrate my recollections

403
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,790
with modern findings.

404
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:07,524
Caveman, you gonna hit me
over the head with a club

405
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,192
and drag me into the bedroom?

406
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,859
You'd be more fun conscious.

407
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:11,800
Oh, John.

408
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:13,097
Let me get this straight.

409
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,002
We're not talking about reincarnation.

410
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:16,870
You're not saying that you remember

411
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,307
whatever the hell it would be,

412
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:19,673
200 separate lifetimes, dying

413
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,111
and being born again and yada yada?

414
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,613
One lifetime.

415
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:26,147
Some lifetime.

416
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,481
Wow.

417
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,986
Maybe there is something
to this reincarnation thing.

418
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,283
You're supposed to come back

419
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:32,914
again and again, learn and learn,

420
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,515
and somehow, John, you just managed

421
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,082
to bypass all the other bodies.

422
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,391
Well, what's the point?

423
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,229
What about oceans?

424
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,599
Didn't see them till much later.

425
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,968
So how would you know
an ocean from a lake?

426
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,803
Big waves - something else.

427
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,036
I can only surmise in retrospect.

428
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,101
Were you curious about
where it all came from?

429
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:57,774
We would look up at the sky and wonder.

430
00:16:57,815 --> 00:16:59,976
"There's gotta be
some big guys up there.

431
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,679
What else made all this down here?"

432
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,243
At first I thought

433
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:05,881
there was something wrong with me -

434
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:08,482
maybe I was a bad guy for not dying.

435
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,891
Then I began to wonder if I was cursed

436
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:15,159
or perhaps blessed.

437
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:18,895
Then I thought maybe I had a mission.

438
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,665
Do you still think you do?

439
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,434
God works in mysterious ways.

440
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:25,806
I think I just happened.

441
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,676
Wow.

442
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,777
Hello?

443
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:38,686
Yes, Ellie?

444
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,554
What's wrong?

445
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:41,683
Sandy?

446
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:42,818
Coming.

447
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,061
Yeah?

448
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:48,826
Do we have Ellie's midterm here?

449
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,291
Yeah, sorry.

450
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:54,837
I picked it up with the periodicals.

451
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,134
Got it.

452
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,902
No, you're worried about your parents?

453
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,341
Don't- Don't worry.

454
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,707
You passed, C+.

455
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,077
Take care of yourself.

456
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:04,478
Good kid.

457
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:06,380
What does pre-med need with history?

458
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,748
Got it.

459
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:09,082
Thank you.

460
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,515
Sorry, guys.

461
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,251
John, please continue.

462
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,553
Come on, I thought we
were done with that.

463
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,186
No! Let's go on with it.

464
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,559
It's interesting.

465
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:22,462
Besides, I think he's making
a certain amount of sense.

466
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,060
Like Hegel.
Logic from absurd premises.

467
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:26,400
That Van Gogh?

468
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:28,598
He gave it to me.

469
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:31,369
I was, uh, Jacques Bourne at the time,

470
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:32,603
A pig farmer.

471
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:33,974
A pig farmer?

472
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,304
I like to work with my hands.

473
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,474
He would come out to the place, paint.

474
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,576
We talked about capturing nature in art.

475
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,746
Turner, Cezanne, Pissarro.

476
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,722
Oh, the Nolde landscapes.

477
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,587
Not in Van Gogh's time.

478
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,182
He would have loved them, though.

479
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:50,194
Yes.

480
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:51,921
Well, I don't understand

481
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:54,157
why you can't remember
where you're from.

482
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:55,961
Geography hasn't changed.

483
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,627
I learned that in-

484
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:58,999
professor Hensen's tepid lectures.

485
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:00,401
But you're right.

486
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:02,530
Where did you live when
you were five years old?

487
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:03,631
Little Rock.

488
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,665
Your mother, she took you to the market?

489
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,040
Mm-Hmm. What direction was it?

490
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:08,443
From your house.

491
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,844
I don't know.

492
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:10,779
How far?

493
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,679
Um, three blocks.

494
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,240
Were there any references

495
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:15,684
that stuck in your mind?

496
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:17,220
Well, there was a gas station

497
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:18,779
and a big field.

498
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:20,983
I was told I could never go there alone.

499
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,650
And if you went back there today,

500
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,160
Would it be the same?

501
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:27,062
No. I'm sure it's all
different and built up.

502
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:29,931
Thus the saying
"You can't go home again"

503
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,229
Because it isn't there anymore.

504
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:32,998
Picture it on my scale-

505
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,369
I migrated through an endless flat space

506
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,773
full of endless new things.

507
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,678
Forests, mountains, tundra, canyons.

508
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:47,241
My memory sees what I saw then.

509
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:50,584
My eye sees freeways, urban sprawl,

510
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:53,818
Big Macs under the Eiffel tower.

511
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:56,587
Early on, the world
got bigger and bigger,

512
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:58,891
and then...

513
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:00,725
Think what I've had to unlearn.

514
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,595
And now you're moving on.

515
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,362
As you've said, there's
talk of my not aging,

516
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:08,133
And when that happens, I move on.

517
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,733
Well, it might make sense
to set up your next identity,

518
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,074
Your next ten years, and
then just drop into it.

519
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,841
I've done that a few times,

520
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,711
even passed as my own son.

521
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,512
"Oh, you're an engineer, too?

522
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:23,019
You're Ben's son. He was a good man."

523
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,714
Saves trouble with
credentials and references.

524
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:28,384
On the other hand, I've
been busted a few times.

525
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:31,452
Spent a year in jail, Belgium, 1862

526
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:33,121
- I won't forget that -

527
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:35,155
for faking a government application.

528
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,030
When'd you come to America?

529
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:39,227
1890, right after Van Gogh's death,

530
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,295
With some French immigrants...

531
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:42,863
Moving on.

532
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:48,736
An answer for every question.

533
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,474
Except one, John.

534
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:51,879
Why're you doing this?

535
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,886
A whim. Maybe not such a good idea.

536
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,444
I...

537
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:01,515
Wanted to say good-bye to you as me,

538
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,457
not what you thought I was.

539
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:05,325
Well, since this isn't funny,

540
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,830
we think you might have a problem.

541
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:09,627
A very serious problem.

542
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:12,698
I've got boxes to move.

543
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,500
I'll give you a hand.

544
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:20,507
Wouldn't you have
some relic, an artifact

545
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:22,944
to remind you of your early life?

546
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:24,447
Like this, maybe?

547
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:25,846
Thrift shop.

548
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:26,940
Really.

549
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,619
If you lived 100... 1,000 years...

550
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,624
Would you still have this?

551
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,628
What would cause you to keep it?

552
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:39,596
As a memento to your beginnings,

553
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,120
even if you didn't have

554
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:43,190
the concept of beginnings?

555
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:45,225
It would be gone, lost.

556
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,428
No.

557
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,268
I don't have artifacts.

558
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,141
Keep that.

559
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,541
Interesting.

560
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:00,276
You could have lied about that.

561
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:02,376
Don't talk about me while I'm gone.

562
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:12,191
Is he serious?

563
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:14,993
If he is, I'm sorry to say he's...

564
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:17,933
Oh, how could he have
concealed that for ten years?

565
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,095
Least he doesn't appear to be dangerous.

566
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,900
What are you doing?

567
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:25,976
Checkin' for a hidden mic.

568
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,341
Candid camera.

569
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:31,113
He's fabricating these wild stories.

570
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:33,082
I've never seen him acting like this.

571
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:35,210
Oh, it's crazy.

572
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:38,710
All right, all right,
as soon as you can, then.

573
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:46,923
I love you, you know.

574
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:49,732
I know.

575
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:54,265
Since my first week at the office.

576
00:22:58,342 --> 00:22:59,274
And?

577
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:02,574
I care very much about you,

578
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,205
but now you know what
you'd be getting into.

579
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:07,147
Do you really think you're a caveman?

580
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:08,708
Do you?

581
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:15,986
Could you love me,

582
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:18,493
or don't you believe in that anymore?

583
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,127
I've gotten over it too many times.

584
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,191
Fond of you...

585
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:28,836
certainly attracted to you.

586
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:32,209
That's it?

587
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:37,746
I can work with that.

588
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:43,476
If what I'm saying is true,

589
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:46,046
you and any children will age.

590
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:47,317
I won't.

591
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,325
And one day I'll leave.

592
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,329
You'll go back to your
May-December romances.

593
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:53,455
The simple fact is

594
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:55,522
that I can't give you forever.

595
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:58,934
How long's forever?

596
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:02,802
Who ever really has it?

597
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:09,378
My parents split up before I was born,

598
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:12,348
And then my mom's next marriage lasted

599
00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:13,816
what, a whole three years?

600
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,721
Then there's death,
illness, acts of god...

601
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:22,916
No one knows how long they have.

602
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:26,390
Or how little.

603
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,199
I love you.

604
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:34,695
Take whatever you can get.

605
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:39,299
Like ten years?

606
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:46,715
Ah! Ha ha ha!

607
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,151
Uhn!

608
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,118
Oh.

609
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:52,145
Why did you do that?

610
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,851
I wanted to see how fast you
were. Check your reflexes.

611
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,018
I don't have eyes in
the back of my head,

612
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,824
I can't hear a flea walking,

613
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:00,524
I am not in any way superman.

614
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:02,963
Well, I'm a second-degree black belt.

615
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,797
Give it another thousand years.

616
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,461
Well. I got it, I got it, I got it.

617
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:11,006
Jesus.

618
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:12,940
Smooth demonstration, Harry.

619
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:14,968
Sit on it, Dan.

620
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,704
I still have questions.

621
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:19,510
l-I do too, John.

622
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,177
I mean, are we done with prehistory yet?

623
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:25,086
Remember any of your original language?

624
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:27,989
A little. One thing
hasn't changed much...

625
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:33,595
Did you ever do any cave art?

626
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:35,656
Do you know the rock art at Les Eyzies?

627
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:36,791
Mm-Hmm.

628
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,200
It was the work of a man named...

629
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:41,796
Giraud.

630
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,466
He did a pretty good job.

631
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:45,941
He would draw the animals

632
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,308
that we hoped to find to eat.

633
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,404
One day after a fruitless hunt,

634
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:52,574
our chief stomped his teeth out

635
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,641
because his magic had failed him.

636
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:57,744
After that, someone had
to chew his food for him.

637
00:25:57,821 --> 00:25:59,618
Finally, he got- I suspect-

638
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:01,648
an infected jaw,

639
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,353
and he was abandoned.

640
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,157
That's awful.

641
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:06,992
You have to know what to kill.

642
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:08,759
Is this why all your students

643
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,165
say your knowledge of history is...

644
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:12,190
so amazing?

645
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:14,294
No, that's mostly based on study.

646
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:18,637
Remember, it's one man,
one place at a time,

647
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:20,906
My solitary viewpoint

648
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:23,674
of a world I knew almost nothing about.

649
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:24,874
Well, let's talk about

650
00:26:24,982 --> 00:26:26,973
what you say you do know about:

651
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:28,416
Historical times.

652
00:26:28,485 --> 00:26:29,816
Don't encourage him.

653
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:31,013
Edith.

654
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:33,921
Next few thousand years, it got warmer.

655
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:35,288
A few thousand years-

656
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,860
See, now I know you're guessing.

657
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:40,363
You can't get there from here, Art.

658
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:42,729
Well then, pray, continue.

659
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:45,734
We hunted reindeer, mammoths,

660
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,703
bison, horses,

661
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:49,262
The game retreated northward

662
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:50,432
as the climate changed.

663
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:52,600
You got the idea of growing food

664
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:54,406
rather than gathering it,

665
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:56,572
raising animals rather
than hunting them.

666
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,206
Am-Am I getting warm, here?

667
00:26:58,248 --> 00:26:59,715
I bet I am.

668
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,184
Lakeside living becomes commonplace,

669
00:27:02,252 --> 00:27:03,776
- Fishing, fowling...
- Come on!

670
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,082
John, this is out of any textbook.

671
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:08,089
Even yours.

672
00:27:08,158 --> 00:27:10,956
You got most of it right.

673
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:13,029
Eventually I headed to the east.

674
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:15,224
I'd grown curious about the world.

675
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:17,825
I'd gotten the hang of going it alone,

676
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:20,428
Learning how to fit in when I wanted to.

677
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:22,268
East.

678
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,170
Towards the rising sun?

679
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:27,004
Yes. I thought it might be warmer there.

680
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:31,179
That's when I saw an ocean.

681
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:35,117
The Mediterranean, probably.

682
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:37,517
It was around the
beginning of the bronze age,

683
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:39,818
So I followed the trade
routes from the east,

684
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,084
Copper, tin,

685
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,219
Learning languages as I went.

686
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:47,320
Everywhere, creation myths,

687
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:50,128
new gods, so many, so different.

688
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,828
I finally realized that it was...

689
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:55,394
probably all hogwash,

690
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,997
So I was Sumerian for 2,000 years,

691
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:00,372
Then finally Babylonian under Hammurabi.

692
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:01,844
Great man.

693
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:04,370
And I sailed as a Phoenician for a time.

694
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:07,645
See, moving on had been
easier as a hunter-gatherer...

695
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,686
Difficult when villages emerged,

696
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:15,191
tougher still in city states
where authority was centralized.

697
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:16,954
Strangers were suspect.

698
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:20,690
It seemed as though I
was always moving on.

699
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:22,664
I learned some new tricks-

700
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,362
even faked my death a couple of times.

701
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:29,664
I continued east

702
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,470
to India,

703
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:34,966
luckily at the time of the Buddha.

704
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:36,172
Luckily.

705
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,646
Most extraordinary man I've ever known.

706
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:42,777
He taught me things

707
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,152
I'd never thought about before.

708
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:47,487
You studied... with the Buddha?

709
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:48,991
Until he died.

710
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:53,229
He knew there was something
different about me.

711
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:55,663
I never told him.

712
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:58,031
This is fascinating.

713
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:00,332
I almost wish it were true.

714
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:04,067
Yeah, if it was true,
why are you telling us?

715
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:05,768
I mean, we might leave here today,

716
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:07,367
Go out there, tell everybody.

717
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:08,934
It would vanish in disbelief.

718
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:12,581
A story that goes around the room.

719
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:14,640
No credibility.

720
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:17,779
Even if I could make you believe me,

721
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,482
in a month, you wouldn't.

722
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:22,047
Some of you would call me a psychopath,

723
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,560
Others would be angry
at a pointless joke.

724
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:26,586
Some of us are angry now.

725
00:29:26,663 --> 00:29:28,563
This-this was a bad idea.

726
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,329
Uh, I love you all, and I do not want

727
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:32,699
to put you through anything.

728
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,964
Then why are you doing it?

729
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:36,335
'Cause I wanted
to say good-bye-

730
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:37,271
As yourself.

731
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:38,864
I think you've done that,

732
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:39,967
whoever that self is.

733
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,170
Easy, Edith.

734
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:42,870
We're just grading his homework.

735
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:45,711
I see what's going on. You're
playing the good cop, Dan.

736
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,011
That's fine. Just enjoy it.

737
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:49,712
All right, I think this
whole thing is just a crock!

738
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:51,482
I should leave, but I'm gonna stay.

739
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:54,218
You know why? 'Cause I wanna
see what this is all about.

740
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,724
So do I. What is this all about?

741
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,886
Let's ask Dr. Freud,
who's just arrived.

742
00:29:57,928 --> 00:29:59,293
Hey, Will! Will!

743
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,230
Art. Hey.

744
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:04,592
John!

745
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:06,102
I'm glad I caught you.

746
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:08,036
Someone mentioned
that you were leaving-

747
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:09,936
Called you, told you that I've lost it.

748
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:12,737
Glad you're here. Things are
going in unexpected directions.

749
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,038
Yes, so I hear.

750
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,305
Hi.

751
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:16,903
Are you hungry?

752
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:18,437
Uh, thank you, no.

753
00:30:18,515 --> 00:30:20,676
Whiskey? Johnny Walker green.

754
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:22,708
Oh, yes.

755
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:28,683
You look very familiar,
my dear. Linda Murphy.

756
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:31,285
I'm in your Tuesday
psych 1 class, Dr. Gruber.

757
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:33,853
Ah, well, this lesson may be something

758
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:36,923
I could not have imagined.

759
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:41,267
I regret being so
obvious about this, John,

760
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:44,603
but these people are all
very concerned for you.

761
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:47,235
Yes, I'm cutting out paper dinosaurs.

762
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:50,440
I really wish I'd been
here from the beginning.

763
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,447
Me too.

764
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,482
Let me just say something right now.

765
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,882
There's absolutely no
way in the whole world

766
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:58,649
for John to prove this story to us,

767
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,590
just like there's no way
for us to disprove it.

768
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,786
No matter how outrageous we think it is,

769
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:07,092
no matter how highly trained
some of us think we are,

770
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,291
there's absolutely
no way to disprove it.

771
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:13,793
Our friend is either a
caveman, a liar, or a nut.

772
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:15,304
So while we're thinking about that,

773
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:17,967
why don't we just go with it?

774
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:19,407
I mean, hell, who knows,

775
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:21,477
he might jolt us into believing him,

776
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:23,502
or we might jolt him back to reality.

777
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:26,015
Believing? Whose reality?

778
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,517
So... you're a caveman.

779
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:29,814
Yes. Uh...

780
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:33,254
Uh, I was a Cro-Magnon, I think.

781
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:36,087
You don't know if
you're a caveman or not?

782
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:37,388
No, I'm sure about that.

783
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:38,519
A Cro-Magnon, then.

784
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:40,621
When did you first realize this?

785
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,858
When the Cro-Magnon
was first identified,

786
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,992
when anthropology gave them a name,

787
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:46,468
I had mine.

788
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:47,935
Well, please continue.

789
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:49,871
I'm sure you must have more to say.

790
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,840
Would you like me to lie on the couch?

791
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,435
As you wish.

792
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:58,871
As a physician, I'm curious.

793
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:02,214
In this enormous lifetime you describe,

794
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,049
have you ever been ill?

795
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:05,884
Sure, as much as anyone.

796
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,447
Seriously ill?

797
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:08,924
Sometimes.

798
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:10,892
Of what? Do you know?

799
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:12,518
In prehistory, I can't tell you.

800
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,086
Maybe pneumonia once or twice.

801
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,998
Last few hundred years,

802
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:21,198
I've gotten over typhoid, yellow fever,

803
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:24,366
smallpox... I survived the black plague.

804
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:25,636
Bubonic?

805
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:27,040
Oh, that's terrible.

806
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,805
More so than history describes.

807
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:32,372
And smallpox.
- But you're not scarred.

808
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,542
I don't scar.

809
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:34,982
No, John, that is not possible.

810
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:36,315
Please, let's take John's story

811
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:39,447
at face value and explore
it from that perspective.

812
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:42,583
If he doesn't scar, it's
no stranger than the rest.

813
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:45,060
John, would you please stop by my lab,

814
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:46,857
suffer a few tests from

815
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,761
your friendly neighborhood biologist.

816
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:50,060
I'm leery of labs.

817
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:52,431
Afraid I might go in and
stay for a thousand years

818
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:54,767
while cigarette smoking
men try to figure me out.

819
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:56,635
You don't think that I would betray you?

820
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:58,072
Walls have ears.

821
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:00,632
Medical tests might be a
way of proving what you say.

822
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:01,769
I don't wanna prove it.

823
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:02,938
So you're telling us this,

824
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,072
the yarn of the century,

825
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:05,843
And you don't care if
we believe it or not?

826
00:33:05,882 --> 00:33:07,543
I guess I shouldn't
have expected you to.

827
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,211
You're not as crazy as you think I am.

828
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:10,184
Amen.

829
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,687
I've always liked you.

830
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,121
Why, thank you, dear.

831
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,487
Now that's changing.

832
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:16,024
Surely you don't believe this nonsense.

833
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:18,118
I think we should remain
courteous to someone

834
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:19,719
who we've known and trusted, Edith.

835
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:22,492
Here you sit.
You can't break his story.

836
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:25,194
All you can do is thumb your nose at it.

837
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:27,226
Is that what you're doing, John?

838
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:28,896
Are you laughing at us inside?

839
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,497
I wish you didn't feel that way.

840
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:33,940
What you're saying -
it offends common sense.

841
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,740
So does relativity, quantum mechanics-

842
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:37,404
That's the way nature works.

843
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:41,848
But your story doesn't fit
into nature as we know it.

844
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:43,613
But we know so little, Dan.

845
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:45,915
We know so little.

846
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:47,116
How many of you know

847
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,419
five geniuses in your field

848
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,652
that you disagree with...

849
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:51,318
One you would like to strangle?

850
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:53,454
Strangle them all.

851
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,157
It's bad enough we have to listen

852
00:33:55,232 --> 00:33:56,426
to Harry's idiotic jokes.

853
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:57,626
Thank you very much, Edith.

854
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,067
Maybe when I'm 110, I'll
be as smart as you are.

855
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:01,468
If you lived as long as John did,

856
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:03,132
you still wouldn't grow up.

857
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:04,765
Come on, guys. Take it easy.

858
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:07,276
How often do we get to meet someone

859
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,711
who says he's a stone age man?

860
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:12,009
Well, once is enough.

861
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:13,379
Edith.

862
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:15,542
All right. A guy with your mind-

863
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,576
you'd have studied a great deal.

864
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:21,090
I have ten degrees,
including all of yours...

865
00:34:21,124 --> 00:34:23,490
Except yours, Will.

866
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,688
That makes me feel a trifle Lilliputian.

867
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:28,027
That's over the span of 170 years.

868
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:31,329
I got my biology degree
at Oxford in 1840,

869
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,062
So I'm a little behind the times.

870
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,331
The same in other areas-

871
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:37,168
I can't keep up with the
new stuff that comes along.

872
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:38,105
No one can.

873
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:39,472
Not even in their specialty.

874
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:40,999
So much for the myth

875
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:42,806
of the super-wise,
all-knowing immortal.

876
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:44,677
I see your point, John.

877
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,340
No matter how long a man lives,

878
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,509
he can't be in advance of his times.

879
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:51,544
He can't know more than
the best of the race knows,

880
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:54,556
if that- I mean, when the
world learned it was round,

881
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:55,886
you learned it.

882
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:57,257
It took some time.

883
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:58,521
News traveled slowly

884
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:00,493
before communications were fancy.

885
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,055
There were social obstacles,

886
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,297
preconceptions, screams from the church.

887
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,461
Ten doctorates.

888
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:09,369
That's impressive,
John. Did you teach them?

889
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:10,703
Some.

890
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:13,368
You might have all done the same.

891
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,538
Living 14,000 years
didn't make me a genius.

892
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,877
I just had time.

893
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:19,472
Time.

894
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,483
We can't see it, we can't hear it,

895
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:25,248
we can't weigh it, we can't
measure it in a laboratory.

896
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:27,483
It's a subjective sense of becoming

897
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:32,028
what we are instead of what
we were a nanosecond ago,

898
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:34,461
becoming what we will
be in another nanosecond.

899
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,489
The Hopis see time as a landscape,

900
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,967
existing before and behind us,

901
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:41,436
and we move...
we move through it,

902
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:43,200
slice by slice.

903
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:44,500
Clocks measure time.

904
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:45,905
No, they measure themselves.

905
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:48,307
The objective referent
of clock is another clock.

906
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:50,743
How very interesting. What
has it got to do with John?

907
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,805
Oh, he- he might be a man

908
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:57,843
who lives outside of time as we know it.

909
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:02,789
Yes, uh, well.

910
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:05,953
People do go around armed these days.

911
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:09,090
If I shot you, John...
You're immortal?

912
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:11,066
Would you survive this?

913
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,865
I never said I was immortal, just old.

914
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:15,064
I might die.

915
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:16,470
And then you could wonder

916
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,905
the rest of your incarcerated
life what you shot.

917
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,374
Well, uh, may I?

918
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:26,673
Preferable to a gun.

919
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:30,015
Will, that was a bit much.

920
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,646
Ooh. Books.

921
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:35,214
Doctorates.

922
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:38,489
Yes, you have grown and changed.

923
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,928
But there is always innate nature.

924
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:43,329
Wouldn't you be more comfortable

925
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,958
squatting in the backyard?

926
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,468
Sometimes I do, Will.

927
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:47,970
Look up at the stars.

928
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:48,993
Wonder.

929
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,439
And what did primitive man make of them?

930
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:53,339
A great mystery.

931
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,810
There were gods up there then.

932
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:58,336
Shamans who knew about them told us.

933
00:36:58,415 --> 00:36:59,609
They still do.

934
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:03,051
Have you ever wished it would end?

935
00:37:05,655 --> 00:37:06,587
No.

936
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,988
Fourteen thousand years.

937
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,687
Injuries, illness, disasters.

938
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:14,059
You've survived them all.

939
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:16,395
You're a very lucky man.

940
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:22,967
Come in.

941
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:27,001
John Oldman?

942
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,374
Yes.

943
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,311
Charity now. We're here
to pick up the furniture.

944
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,075
It's all yours.

945
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:33,376
Here, take this chair.

946
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:35,384
I'm gonna go drink in the corner.

947
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:39,947
You're, uh... you're donating it?

948
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,184
Everything?

949
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:42,316
I'll get more.

950
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:43,916
Do you always travel this light?

951
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:46,087
It's the only way to move.

952
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:49,596
Oh, you-

953
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,189
You've talked a good deal

954
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:54,465
about your extraordinary
amount of living.

955
00:37:54,504 --> 00:37:56,665
What do you think of dying, John?

956
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:58,298
Do you fear death?

957
00:37:58,341 --> 00:37:59,603
Who wouldn't?

958
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:01,702
How did primitive man regard death?

959
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:03,838
Well, we had the practical concept.

960
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,814
You know, we stopped,

961
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:07,680
fell down, didn't get up,

962
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,946
Started to smell bad, come apart.

963
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:12,079
Injuries we could understand.

964
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:14,680
If someone's insides
were all over the ground.

965
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:16,055
Infections...

966
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:20,552
They were, uh, mysterious.

967
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:23,097
Aging...

968
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,656
The biggest mystery of all.

969
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,692
You realized you were different.

970
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,796
Longer to realize how I was different,

971
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:31,670
to find a way to synthesize

972
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,199
my experience into a view of myself.

973
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:36,711
At first, I thought everybody had

974
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,475
something wrong with them.

975
00:38:38,581 --> 00:38:42,142
They got old and they
died, animals, too...

976
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:43,174
but not me.

977
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:49,022
Oh, forgive me, my dear.

978
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:50,684
You live simply.

979
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:53,218
I've owned castles, but why leave a lot

980
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:54,524
if you're always leaving?

981
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:55,723
I have money.

982
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,529
What, you get into
AT&T at 50 cents, John?

983
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:02,364
As one grows older,

984
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:07,775
the days, weeks, months
go by more quickly.

985
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:10,870
What does a day or a year

986
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:13,472
or a century mean to you?

987
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,075
The birth-death cycle?

988
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,710
Turbulence.

989
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,278
I meet someone,

990
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:22,189
learn their name, say
a word, they're gone.

991
00:39:22,258 --> 00:39:26,661
Others come like waves. Rise, fall.

992
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:30,598
Ripples in a wheat
field, blown by the wind.

993
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:33,329
Do you ever get tired of it all?

994
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,769
I get bored now and then.

995
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:38,069
They keep making the same
stupid mistakes over and over.

996
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:39,006
They.

997
00:39:40,076 --> 00:39:41,270
Then you see yourself

998
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:43,573
as separate from the rest of humanity.

999
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:46,377
I didn't mean it that way.

1000
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:48,810
But of course...

1001
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:50,975
I am.

1002
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,187
Are you comfortable
knowing that you have lived

1003
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:59,125
while everyone you knew
- Everyone you knew, John! -

1004
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:00,287
has died?

1005
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,093
I've regretted losing people...

1006
00:40:02,132 --> 00:40:03,099
often.

1007
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,565
Have you ever felt guilt about that,

1008
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:07,832
something akin to survivor's guilt?

1009
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:10,099
In the strict psychological sense?

1010
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,471
I suppose I have.

1011
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:12,600
Yeah.

1012
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,203
But what can I do about it?

1013
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:19,704
Indeed.

1014
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,012
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1015
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:23,211
Gentlemen, I'm-

1016
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,187
I'm gonna keep the couch.

1017
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:26,119
Thanks.

1018
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:28,315
Ladies? Will? Oh, no...

1019
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:31,019
You've got a heart condition.
Don't grump about it.

1020
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,823
Hey, how about changing
the subject, Will?

1021
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:34,625
Enough with the- with the dying.

1022
00:40:34,664 --> 00:40:38,361
But this is the flip
side of his coin, Harry.

1023
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:41,131
I'm very curious to know his feelings.

1024
00:40:41,237 --> 00:40:44,104
Would you prefer I asked
him about his father?

1025
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,539
I thought you always started with

1026
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:46,872
"Tell me about your mother."

1027
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:49,969
Yes, but prehistory was
strongly patriarchal.

1028
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:53,106
Surely you remember your father.

1029
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:56,175
I seem to remember a figure,

1030
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:59,187
Perhaps an older brother,
a social father, maybe.

1031
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:00,847
Well, no matter.

1032
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,222
I can scarcely remember mine.

1033
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:07,218
Do you feel a vacancy

1034
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:09,288
in your life about that, John,

1035
00:41:09,332 --> 00:41:11,323
something you wish could be filled

1036
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:14,234
by a face, a voice, an image?

1037
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,106
Not at this late date.

1038
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:20,439
There must be
someone - probably many-

1039
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,171
that you valued intensely.

1040
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:23,543
Loved.

1041
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:27,105
You saw them age and die -

1042
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,551
a friend, a colleague, a wife.

1043
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,919
Certainly you've had wives and children?

1044
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:35,322
I'd move on.

1045
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:37,121
I had to move on.

1046
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:39,855
Making him history's biggest bigamist.

1047
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,658
Have you ever in your life thought

1048
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,325
"It should have been me"?

1049
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,628
Maybe.

1050
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:50,138
Yeah, Art has told me

1051
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:51,936
that some of your early fellows

1052
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:54,637
feared you were stealing their lives.

1053
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:57,339
Have you thought that perhaps you were?

1054
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,779
Perhaps you are!

1055
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:01,976
There have always been
legends of such a thing,

1056
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:04,009
a creature not quite human

1057
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:08,148
taking not the blood,
but the life force itself?

1058
00:42:08,191 --> 00:42:09,419
My God, Will.

1059
00:42:09,492 --> 00:42:11,892
Unconsciously, perhaps,

1060
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:15,954
by some biological or psychic mechanism

1061
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:17,933
that we can only guess at.

1062
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,993
I'm not saying you would do
such a thing deliberately.

1063
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:24,063
I'm not saying that you
would even know how to...

1064
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:25,404
Would you?

1065
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,844
But would such a thing be fair?

1066
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,505
So you believe me now?

1067
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:34,847
I'm only exploring what you have said.

1068
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:38,820
Whether I believe it or
not is of no importance.

1069
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:40,618
We will die.

1070
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:42,352
You will live.

1071
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:44,552
Will you come to my funeral, John?

1072
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:45,821
Hey, Will...

1073
00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:47,022
You've gone too far.

1074
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,758
John didn't ask to be what he is.

1075
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:52,426
And we did not ask to hear about it.

1076
00:42:52,468 --> 00:42:53,935
But if it were true,

1077
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:57,063
is there one among us
who would not feel envy,

1078
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,574
even perhaps a touch of hatred?

1079
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:03,211
You told us of yourself, John.

1080
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:05,179
Can you imagine how we feel?

1081
00:43:05,214 --> 00:43:07,273
I never thought of that.

1082
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:09,308
Since you may not die,

1083
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,115
while we most assuredly will...

1084
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:14,349
There must be a reason for that, no?

1085
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,221
Perhaps you are an expert.

1086
00:43:17,627 --> 00:43:20,152
Uh, that's it, Mr. Oldman.
Have a good one.

1087
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:21,891
Thank you. You too.

1088
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,727
Or are you a vampire, John?

1089
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,499
Even an unknowing one.

1090
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:33,200
Do you stand alive and tall

1091
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,402
in a graveyard that you helped to fill?

1092
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:36,912
That's going too far.

1093
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:39,847
Bored, perhaps lonely,
because your heart

1094
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,884
cannot keep its treasures.

1095
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:43,909
Is that what you're doing?

1096
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:47,312
Have you led a wrongful life?

1097
00:43:48,424 --> 00:43:50,415
Well, then, perhaps

1098
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:53,324
it is time to die.

1099
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:56,325
Wait a minute, now.

1100
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:58,334
Look, I don't know what John is doing,

1101
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,768
But I sure as hell don't
like what you're doing.

1102
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:03,203
Give me that gun or I'm
gonna break your goddamn arm.

1103
00:44:03,272 --> 00:44:06,537
You sound like our football coach, Dan.

1104
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:08,510
What do you think, John?

1105
00:44:08,578 --> 00:44:10,478
A shot to the arm?

1106
00:44:10,513 --> 00:44:13,414
Perhaps we could watch it heal.

1107
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:15,576
A bullet in the head...

1108
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:17,711
What exactly will happen?

1109
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:25,887
I have papers to correct.

1110
00:44:25,928 --> 00:44:28,624
As much as I dislike that job,

1111
00:44:28,698 --> 00:44:31,394
it'll be preferable to this.

1112
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:35,027
I leave you with it.

1113
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:39,637
Jesus Christ.

1114
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:41,643
What the hell was that all about?

1115
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:42,905
Where'd he get a gun?

1116
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,536
He had you on the ropes, John.

1117
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:46,138
Are you really so damn smart?

1118
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:47,512
It's not like Will.

1119
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:51,216
Mary passed away yesterday.

1120
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:54,917
Who?

1121
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:57,424
His wife.

1122
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:00,624
She had, uh, pancreatic cancer.

1123
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:03,489
Will!

1124
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:06,795
I didn't know about Mary.

1125
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:10,270
I'm sorry. I can see how
this might have hit you.

1126
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:14,208
Please, permit me to
be infantile by myself.

1127
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:16,575
Will, please.

1128
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:34,993
What the hell were you thinking, Art?

1129
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:36,828
Oh, come on. Something had to be done.

1130
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:38,264
I have to say I agree.

1131
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:39,598
And he's our friend.

1132
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:41,897
Whatever else on Earth is going on,

1133
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:42,996
He's our friend!

1134
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,006
You sure about that?

1135
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:45,597
Why are you being so hard on him?

1136
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:48,370
One of my favorite
people has disappeared.

1137
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:51,744
Can you get Alzheimer's at 35?

1138
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:55,079
Maybe I'm trying to wake him up.

1139
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:58,713
Maybe I'm too sad to cry.

1140
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:05,928
What I said about myself hurt him.

1141
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:08,294
He struck back expertly.

1142
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:11,094
That stuff about stealing life forces?

1143
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:13,897
I've always wondered about the reasons.

1144
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:23,575
Well, we still have an
afternoon to kill, right?

1145
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:27,478
Charades?

1146
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:31,880
No. John?

1147
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:34,583
I have a charade, and
it is just for you.

1148
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:35,591
Sandy, come here.

1149
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:37,283
Come on, come on, come on.

1150
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:38,953
Okay, this one's for you.

1151
00:46:38,995 --> 00:46:40,895
Ready?

1152
00:46:51,941 --> 00:46:53,431
Ooh!

1153
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:54,908
Unh.

1154
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:56,569
My first wedding?

1155
00:46:56,612 --> 00:46:58,102
There you go.

1156
00:46:58,147 --> 00:46:59,614
There you go!

1157
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:02,277
Very good, and I bet at least one of us

1158
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:03,443
is your direct descendent.

1159
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:05,545
And I didn't even send a Christmas card.

1160
00:47:05,588 --> 00:47:07,749
Christmas card? What
about a birthday card?

1161
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,917
And don't even get me
started on the candles...

1162
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:11,927
with the blowing and the

1163
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:13,792
for years with the blowing.

1164
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:17,799
Yeah, all right. I tried.

1165
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:21,132
Well, uh, call me underdeveloped,

1166
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,502
but I'd like to hear more.

1167
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,039
Me too.

1168
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:28,304
More.

1169
00:47:28,377 --> 00:47:30,709
You double-damn swear
this isn't some cockamamie

1170
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,941
science fiction story or...

1171
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:34,313
you're pulling on us?

1172
00:47:34,383 --> 00:47:36,783
Next question.

1173
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:38,184
You-You-You realize

1174
00:47:38,221 --> 00:47:39,483
this is an invitation

1175
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:41,683
to men in white suits with happy pills.

1176
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:42,691
Think about it.

1177
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:44,590
A mechanism allowing survival

1178
00:47:44,627 --> 00:47:45,924
for thousands of years?

1179
00:47:45,995 --> 00:47:48,190
Run out of room even faster.

1180
00:47:48,297 --> 00:47:50,527
Then we'd have to go to Mars as a colony

1181
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,431
as we expanded, as we'd have to.

1182
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:54,332
I'd like that.

1183
00:47:54,403 --> 00:47:56,371
On a planet of another star.

1184
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:58,202
I envy you.

1185
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:00,605
Did you have a pet dinosaur?

1186
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:02,941
They were a little bit before my time.

1187
00:48:02,979 --> 00:48:04,139
At least something is.

1188
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:07,273
No doubt you could give us
a thousand details, John,

1189
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,339
corroborating your story,

1190
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:10,852
from the Magdalene to the Buddha to now.

1191
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:11,979
Ten thousand,

1192
00:48:12,054 --> 00:48:13,646
and you could stay out of the books.

1193
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:16,089
Oh, it's getting chilly.

1194
00:48:16,158 --> 00:48:18,353
Here, come over here. Join me.

1195
00:48:20,696 --> 00:48:24,359
That, uh, raises an
interesting question, John.

1196
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,867
Could there be others like you

1197
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,097
who escaped the aging
process as you have?

1198
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,467
Representing something terrific

1199
00:48:29,505 --> 00:48:30,802
we don't even know about in biology.

1200
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:32,101
We're learning all the time.

1201
00:48:32,174 --> 00:48:33,266
Yeah, but how would he know?

1202
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:36,368
He doesn't wear an I.D. badge
saying "yabba dabba doo."

1203
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:39,006
There was a man in the 1600s.

1204
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:41,572
Where were you in 1292 A. D?

1205
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:44,278
Where were you a year ago on this date?

1206
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,687
Anyway, it was the
1600s, and I met a man,

1207
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:52,421
and I had a hunch that he was...

1208
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:54,326
like me, so I told him.

1209
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:58,163
Ah. See, you said this was a first.

1210
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,132
I forgot.

1211
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,998
A crack in your story, John?

1212
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:03,028
A touch of senility.

1213
00:49:03,072 --> 00:49:04,972
Anyway, he said yes,

1214
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,032
but from another time, another place.

1215
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:08,543
We talked for two days.

1216
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:10,578
It was all pretty convincing,

1217
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:12,841
But we couldn't be sure.

1218
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,146
We each confirmed what the other said,

1219
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:17,414
but how do we know if the confirmation

1220
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:19,216
was genuine or an echo?

1221
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:20,950
I knew I was kosher,

1222
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,892
but I thought, "maybe he's
playing a game on me."

1223
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:28,260
You know, a scholar
of all we spoke about.

1224
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:31,356
He said he was inclined
with the same reservation.

1225
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,560
Now, that's interesting.

1226
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:34,795
Just as we can never be sure,

1227
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,360
even if we wanted to.

1228
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:37,872
I mean, if we were sure,

1229
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,566
you couldn't be sure of that.

1230
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:41,700
We parted, agreeing to keep in touch

1231
00:49:41,777 --> 00:49:43,176
- of course, we didn't -

1232
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:45,680
and 200 years later I thought I saw him

1233
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:47,945
in a train station in Brussels.

1234
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,508
Lost him in the crowd.

1235
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:51,678
Oh, what a shame.

1236
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:53,518
l- I mean, if it were true.

1237
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:55,284
Okay, here's one for you.

1238
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,622
What do you do in your spare time?

1239
00:49:58,794 --> 00:49:59,886
Every 50 years or so,

1240
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:01,794
when I wanna get away from the rush,

1241
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:04,197
I go down to a primitive
tribe in New Guinea

1242
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,599
where I'm worshipped as an immortal god,

1243
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:09,001
and they have a huge statue of me.

1244
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:10,198
It's a big party.

1245
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:12,207
Yeah, I've got a lot of pictures of it,

1246
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:14,106
but I've already packed
them up. I'm sorry.

1247
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:17,907
I won't make the obvious nasty
crack about more unwashed cavemen.

1248
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:19,244
Actually, bathing was the style

1249
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,180
until the middle ages
when the church told us

1250
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:24,050
it was sinful to wash away God's dirt,

1251
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,246
so people were sewn

1252
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:26,948
into their underwear in October

1253
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,684
and they popped out in April.

1254
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:30,419
You said you just happened.

1255
00:50:30,459 --> 00:50:32,290
I don't believe that.

1256
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:34,057
If your story's true,

1257
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,031
why did God allow you to happen?

1258
00:50:37,066 --> 00:50:39,967
That makes an interesting point.

1259
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:41,628
Are you religious, John?

1260
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,195
I don't follow a known religion. No.

1261
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,229
Ever.

1262
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:47,571
Long time ago I did,

1263
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:49,838
like most people.

1264
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:51,676
Some just never get over it.

1265
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:53,078
Do you believe in God?

1266
00:50:54,183 --> 00:50:55,946
As Laplace said,

1267
00:50:55,985 --> 00:50:58,613
"I have no need of that hypothesis."

1268
00:50:58,654 --> 00:51:00,144
He may be around, though.

1269
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:02,749
He's everywhere. We just can't see him.

1270
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,420
Pfft. If this was the best I could do,

1271
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:06,961
I'd be hiding, too.

1272
00:51:06,996 --> 00:51:08,429
And creation...

1273
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:10,829
It's here.
- I'm not so sure it was created.

1274
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,128
What then?

1275
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:15,728
Maybe it's just accumulated,
fields affecting fields.

1276
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:18,433
What about the source
of the field energies?

1277
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:20,407
Wouldn't that imply a prime mover?

1278
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:22,502
I'd wonder about the
source of the prime mover,

1279
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:25,739
infinite regress, but that
doesn't imply anything to me.

1280
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,510
Back to the mystery.

1281
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:29,607
It's a very old question,

1282
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:33,520
But there's no answer
except in religious terms.

1283
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:36,218
If you have faith, it's answered.

1284
00:51:36,325 --> 00:51:39,726
Did you ever meet any person
from our religious history?

1285
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:41,753
A biblical figure?

1286
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:43,128
In a way.

1287
00:51:43,165 --> 00:51:44,826
Who?

1288
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,334
We should skip this one.

1289
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:48,063
No, no, no skipping. Come on.

1290
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:49,297
Next question.

1291
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:50,737
No, come on!

1292
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:53,335
Come on, spit it out!

1293
00:51:53,442 --> 00:51:55,034
Good lord! You were one of them!

1294
00:51:55,077 --> 00:51:58,706
This is going in a direction
that I didn't expect.

1295
00:51:58,747 --> 00:52:01,841
I hoped it wouldn't.
We... call it a night.

1296
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:05,047
Come on! You were someone
in religious history?

1297
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:06,281
Yes.

1298
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:07,812
In the Bible?

1299
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:08,788
Yes.

1300
00:52:08,824 --> 00:52:09,882
Someone we know?

1301
00:52:09,925 --> 00:52:11,950
How could we not know
someone in the Bible?

1302
00:52:11,994 --> 00:52:13,427
I mean somebody important.

1303
00:52:13,496 --> 00:52:14,827
You may think you know him,

1304
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:16,387
but it's mostly myth.

1305
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:19,765
The entire Bible is
mostly myth and allegory

1306
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:23,135
with maybe some basis
in historical events.

1307
00:52:23,205 --> 00:52:27,471
You were part of that history?

1308
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,602
Yes.

1309
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:30,906
Moses.

1310
00:52:31,013 --> 00:52:34,813
Moses was based on Misis, a Syrian myth,

1311
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,681
and there are earlier versions.

1312
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,448
All found floating on water,

1313
00:52:38,521 --> 00:52:41,046
the staff that changed to a snake,

1314
00:52:41,123 --> 00:52:43,591
waters that were parted so followers

1315
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:45,150
could be led to freedom

1316
00:52:45,227 --> 00:52:46,626
and even receive laws

1317
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:48,253
on stone or wooden tablets.

1318
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:51,128
One of the apostles.

1319
00:52:51,233 --> 00:52:53,599
They weren't really apostles.

1320
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:55,968
They didn't do any real teaching.

1321
00:52:56,038 --> 00:52:59,337
Peter the fisherman learned
a little more about fishing.

1322
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,309
How do you know that?

1323
00:53:03,712 --> 00:53:06,704
The mythical overlay is so enormous...

1324
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:10,108
and not good.

1325
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:16,318
The truth is so, so simple.

1326
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:20,089
The New Testament in 100
words or less: you ready?

1327
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:21,687
I don't think I wanna hear this.

1328
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,197
Harry, will you take me home?

1329
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:25,096
No, not right now.
I do want to hear this.

1330
00:53:25,134 --> 00:53:27,500
Sit down, Edith.
You act like you believe him.

1331
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:28,901
It's sacrilege.

1332
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:30,098
How can it be sacrilege?

1333
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,230
He hasn't said anything yet.

1334
00:53:31,307 --> 00:53:33,901
The new New Testament is sacrilege.

1335
00:53:33,943 --> 00:53:36,810
There are a dozen new New Testaments,

1336
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:39,678
From Hebrew to Greek
to Latin to Tyndale,

1337
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:41,512
all the way to King James,

1338
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,812
all revisionist,

1339
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:45,115
and all called revealed truth.

1340
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:48,317
I mean a new New Testament in 100 words.

1341
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:50,655
I can give you the ten
commandments in ten words:

1342
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:52,216
Don't. Don't, don't, don't,

1343
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:54,058
Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

1344
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:55,619
Don't.

1345
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:58,757
The commandments are just modern
updates of more ancient laws.

1346
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:00,563
Hammurabi's code.

1347
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:03,070
That's right, they
weren't the first, right?

1348
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:06,040
Edith, I was raised on the Torah...

1349
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:07,474
My wife, on the Koran.

1350
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:09,168
My oldest son is an atheist.

1351
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:11,008
My youngest is a Scientologist.

1352
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,775
My daughter is studying Hinduism.

1353
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:17,081
I imagine that there is room there
for a holy war in my living room,

1354
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,280
but we practice live and let live.

1355
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:22,090
Why don't you sit down?

1356
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:32,099
What is your preferred
version of the Bible?

1357
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:33,533
The King James, of course.

1358
00:54:33,602 --> 00:54:36,070
It's the most modern, the
work of great scholars.

1359
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:37,595
Modern is good.

1360
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:41,603
All right, John,
hit us with the short form.

1361
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,671
Guy met the Buddha, liked what he heard,

1362
00:54:45,714 --> 00:54:47,511
thought about it for a while -

1363
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:49,312
say 500 years, while he returned

1364
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:51,319
to the Mediterranean,

1365
00:54:51,353 --> 00:54:53,218
became an Etruscan.

1366
00:54:53,322 --> 00:54:54,983
Seeped into the Roman empire.

1367
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:56,719
He didn't like what they became -

1368
00:54:56,759 --> 00:54:58,920
A giant killing machine.

1369
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:00,655
He went to the Near East thinking,

1370
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:03,926
"Why not pass the Buddha's
teachings on in a modern form."

1371
00:55:03,966 --> 00:55:06,161
So he tried.

1372
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:08,362
One dissident against Rome?

1373
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:09,496
Rome won.

1374
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:10,902
The rest is history.

1375
00:55:10,973 --> 00:55:13,464
Well, sort of. Lot of
fairy tales mixed in.

1376
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:18,212
I knew it.

1377
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,214
He's saying he was Christ.

1378
00:55:20,282 --> 00:55:22,079
Oh, no. That's the medal

1379
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,482
they pinned on Jesus
to fulfill prophecy.

1380
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,680
The crucifixion.

1381
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:28,713
He blocked the pain
as he had learned to do

1382
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,088
in Tibet and India.

1383
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,491
He also learned to
slow his body processes

1384
00:55:32,528 --> 00:55:35,122
down to the point where
they were undetectable.

1385
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:36,562
They thought he was dead.

1386
00:55:36,598 --> 00:55:37,895
So his followers pulled him

1387
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,230
from the cross, placed him in a cave...

1388
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:42,930
His body normalized as
he had trained it to.

1389
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:46,640
He attempted to go away undetected,

1390
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:49,143
but some devotees were standing watch.

1391
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:53,012
Tried to explain.

1392
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:55,414
They were ecstatic.

1393
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:57,917
Thus, I was resurrected,

1394
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,988
and I ascended to central Europe

1395
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:01,887
to get away as far as possible.

1396
00:56:01,957 --> 00:56:04,425
You don't mean a word of this, John.

1397
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,428
My God, why are you doing this?

1398
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:07,986
Let me see your wrists.

1399
00:56:08,063 --> 00:56:09,462
I don't scar.

1400
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:11,090
Besides, they tied me...

1401
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:14,329
but nails and blood make
better religious art.

1402
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,498
All the speculations about Jesus.

1403
00:56:17,573 --> 00:56:19,268
He was black, he was Asian,

1404
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:21,776
he was a blue-eyed Aryan
with a golden beard

1405
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,210
and hair straight out
of Vidal Sassoon's,

1406
00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:27,442
He was a benevolent alien,
he never existed at all.

1407
00:56:27,483 --> 00:56:29,576
Now he's a caveman.

1408
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:32,712
The Christ figure goes all
the way back to Krishna -

1409
00:56:32,788 --> 00:56:33,777
Hercules, of course.

1410
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:34,789
Hercules?

1411
00:56:34,823 --> 00:56:37,519
Born of a virgin, Alcmene.

1412
00:56:37,593 --> 00:56:40,187
A god for a father, Zeus.

1413
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:42,789
The only begotten.

1414
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:45,391
The savior
- The Greek? Soter.

1415
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:47,594
The good shepherd, the prince of peace,

1416
00:56:47,636 --> 00:56:50,161
bringing gentle persuasion
and divine wisdom.

1417
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:53,003
He died, joined his father on Olympus

1418
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,737
a thousand years before Gethsemane.

1419
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:59,679
How can you compare pagan
mythology to the true word?

1420
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:02,183
Pretty damn closely, I'd say.

1421
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:04,651
The early Christian leaders,

1422
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:06,586
they threw away Hebrew manuscripts

1423
00:57:06,655 --> 00:57:09,556
and borrowed from pagan
sources all over the place.

1424
00:57:09,591 --> 00:57:12,151
Do you realize how...

1425
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:14,456
inconsiderately you're
treating my feelings?

1426
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:17,988
About as inconsiderately
as we're treating John's.

1427
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:20,261
Well, he doesn't
believe what he's saying!

1428
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:22,862
Do you believe literally
everything in the Bible, Edith?

1429
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:23,963
Yes!

1430
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:25,369
Before you say it,

1431
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:28,102
I know it's undergone a lot of changes,

1432
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:30,611
But God has spoken through man

1433
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:32,613
to make his word clearer.

1434
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:35,081
He couldn't get it right the first time?

1435
00:57:35,117 --> 00:57:38,314
We're imperfect! He had to
work to make us understand.

1436
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:41,481
He couldn't get us right
the first time, Edith?

1437
00:57:41,523 --> 00:57:44,321
Taken alone, the
philosophical teachings of Jesus

1438
00:57:44,393 --> 00:57:46,418
are Buddhism with a Hebrew accent.

1439
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:50,261
Kindness, tolerance, brotherhood, love,

1440
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:51,926
a ruthless realism acknowledging

1441
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,231
that life is as it is here
on Earth, here and now.

1442
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:58,364
The kingdom of God, meaning goodness,

1443
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:01,399
is right here, where it should be.

1444
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:03,468
"I am what I am becoming."

1445
00:58:03,545 --> 00:58:05,103
That's what the Buddha brought in.

1446
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:06,478
And that's what I taught.

1447
00:58:06,548 --> 00:58:09,517
But a talking snake
make a lady eat an apple,

1448
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:10,643
So we're screwed.

1449
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:12,176
Heaven and hell were peddled

1450
00:58:12,254 --> 00:58:15,485
so priests could rule
through seduction and terror,

1451
00:58:15,557 --> 00:58:18,754
save our souls that we never
lost in the first place.

1452
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:20,352
I threw a clean pass...

1453
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:22,521
they ran it out of the ballpark.

1454
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:25,260
This is blasphemy.

1455
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,098
It's horrible! Who else were you?

1456
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,434
Solomon, Elvis, Jack the ripper?

1457
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:32,531
It's been said that Buddha and Jesus

1458
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:34,633
would laugh or cry if they'd known

1459
00:58:34,676 --> 00:58:36,075
what was done in their name.

1460
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:37,908
And if there is a creator,

1461
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,778
he'd probably feel the same way.

1462
00:58:40,816 --> 00:58:43,376
I see ceremony, ritual, processions,

1463
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:46,080
genuflecting, moaning, intoning,

1464
00:58:46,121 --> 00:58:48,783
venerating cookies and wine,

1465
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:50,519
and I think...

1466
00:58:50,592 --> 00:58:51,957
It's not what I had in mind.

1467
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,291
But that's Vatican flapdoodle.

1468
00:58:53,328 --> 00:58:55,796
It doesn't have a thing to do with God.

1469
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:58,959
As you said, John,
everywhere, religions...

1470
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:02,061
from exalting life to
purging joy as a sin.

1471
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:04,731
Rome does it as grand opera.

1472
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,770
A simple path to goodness needs

1473
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:09,777
a supernatural roadmap.

1474
00:59:09,845 --> 00:59:11,870
Supernatural...

1475
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:14,541
A stupid word, I mean...

1476
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:16,515
Anything that happens,
happens within nature,

1477
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:18,645
whether we believe in it or not.

1478
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:20,746
Like a 14,000-year-old caveman.

1479
00:59:29,598 --> 00:59:31,725
l- l-I drove for a while,

1480
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,894
and then I sat for a while.

1481
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:35,266
I'm so ashamed.

1482
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,031
And I'm freezing.

1483
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:38,266
Well, come inside.

1484
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:40,466
I still don't believe you, of course.

1485
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:41,476
You need help.

1486
00:59:41,577 --> 00:59:42,509
Everybody needs help.

1487
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:44,671
Yes, well, some more than others.

1488
00:59:58,694 --> 01:00:00,787
From the Buddha to the cross,

1489
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:05,528
I have always imagined
both as entirely mythic -

1490
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,899
but I would like to hear more.

1491
01:00:08,003 --> 01:00:10,631
May I lie on the couch for a moment?

1492
01:00:10,706 --> 01:00:13,300
I'm not as young as I used to be.

1493
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:17,000
Ohh!

1494
01:00:19,214 --> 01:00:23,207
So, you were Jesus.

1495
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:26,345
Well, perhaps somebody had to
be, for better or for worse.

1496
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:28,048
The jury is still out.

1497
01:00:28,123 --> 01:00:31,115
When did you begin to
believe you were Jesus?

1498
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:34,253
When did you begin to believe
you were a psychiatrist?

1499
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:37,321
Since I graduated Harvard medical school

1500
01:00:37,432 --> 01:00:40,094
and finished my residency,
I've had that feeling.

1501
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:42,365
Oh, I sometimes dream about it.

1502
01:00:42,437 --> 01:00:44,564
Have you acted upon this belief?

1503
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,006
I had a private practice for a while,

1504
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:48,509
and then I taught.

1505
01:00:48,543 --> 01:00:49,942
Nothing unusual -

1506
01:00:49,978 --> 01:00:53,243
oh, until one day, I met a caveman

1507
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:55,806
who thought he was Jesus.

1508
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:58,285
Do you find that unusual?

1509
01:00:58,353 --> 01:01:00,787
Very. I would stake my reputation

1510
01:01:00,856 --> 01:01:03,086
he is as sane as I am,

1511
01:01:03,191 --> 01:01:06,092
so why does he persist in such a story?

1512
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:08,255
There must be a reason, though.

1513
01:01:08,296 --> 01:01:10,161
Unless I imagined it all?

1514
01:01:10,198 --> 01:01:11,392
Is that possible?

1515
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,297
I think you're as sane as he is.

1516
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:15,030
Oh, God, l-

1517
01:01:15,103 --> 01:01:16,730
No.

1518
01:01:18,306 --> 01:01:21,241
Did you ever find it
prudent to worship yourself

1519
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:23,038
rather than be thought a heretic?

1520
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:24,237
That would be something.

1521
01:01:24,312 --> 01:01:26,837
Other times, Christianity
was considered heresy.

1522
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:28,610
I had to pretend other faiths.

1523
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:32,711
And what does Jesus have
to say to those present

1524
01:01:32,754 --> 01:01:35,120
who find it difficult to believe in him?

1525
01:01:35,157 --> 01:01:37,751
Believe in what he tried to teach,

1526
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:39,726
without rigmarole.

1527
01:01:39,761 --> 01:01:42,423
Piety is not what the
lessons bring to people.

1528
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:45,126
It's the mistake they
bring to the lessons.

1529
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:55,271
Well, it's getting to be night.

1530
01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:58,939
I still have stuff to carry

1531
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,244
and a long drive.

1532
01:02:01,283 --> 01:02:02,773
I'll help.

1533
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:06,413
John, do you have
a destination in mind?

1534
01:02:07,789 --> 01:02:09,154
Never mind.

1535
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:10,590
I won't ask.

1536
01:02:11,626 --> 01:02:12,615
Thank you.

1537
01:02:20,001 --> 01:02:22,799
Anyone mentally ill can imagine

1538
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:25,830
a fantastic background,
even an entire life,

1539
01:02:25,907 --> 01:02:28,102
and sincerely believe it.

1540
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,735
The man who thinks he is Napoleon

1541
01:02:30,812 --> 01:02:32,609
does believe it.

1542
01:02:32,714 --> 01:02:35,581
His true identity has taken a backseat

1543
01:02:35,617 --> 01:02:38,518
to his delusion and the need for it.

1544
01:02:38,553 --> 01:02:40,521
If that's the case with John,

1545
01:02:40,555 --> 01:02:42,523
there is a grave disorder.

1546
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:44,923
Organized brilliantly.

1547
01:02:45,026 --> 01:02:47,017
He's got an answer for everything.

1548
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:49,723
It might involve
rejection of his father,

1549
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:51,392
of his entire early past,

1550
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:53,025
replaced by this fantasy.

1551
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:55,161
He says he can't remember his father.

1552
01:02:55,237 --> 01:02:56,135
Precisely why?

1553
01:02:56,238 --> 01:02:57,762
You said he was sane.

1554
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,067
Did I?

1555
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:02,908
Do you think that perhaps our caveman

1556
01:03:02,978 --> 01:03:04,707
has a monkey on his back?

1557
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,270
Drugs?

1558
01:03:06,381 --> 01:03:07,780
No, no, no, no.

1559
01:03:07,816 --> 01:03:10,250
I've done a lot of consulting
work with narcotics.

1560
01:03:10,285 --> 01:03:12,344
I've seen people tripping, strung out...

1561
01:03:12,387 --> 01:03:14,446
Whatever's up with John, it isn't that.

1562
01:03:14,489 --> 01:03:16,320
I've looked for signs - none.

1563
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:18,120
Could cavemen really talk?

1564
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:20,593
We think that language
came into existence

1565
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:21,823
60,000 years ago.

1566
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:23,888
The structure of stone age culture

1567
01:03:23,932 --> 01:03:26,196
is evidence of the
ability to communicate -

1568
01:03:26,234 --> 01:03:27,599
verbally.

1569
01:03:29,337 --> 01:03:31,498
Oh, shut up.

1570
01:03:40,649 --> 01:03:42,844
Maybe it'd be easier if I were.

1571
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,010
Crazy?

1572
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,810
No.

1573
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:02,663
That is fascinating, isn't it,

1574
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:05,798
a brave attempt to teach
Buddhism in the west.

1575
01:04:05,874 --> 01:04:07,535
It's no wonder he failed.

1576
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:09,168
We're not ready for it.

1577
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:11,677
You're talking
as if you believed him.

1578
01:04:11,713 --> 01:04:13,840
Well, it is possible, isn't it?

1579
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:15,850
I mean, anything is possible.

1580
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:18,079
Look, we have two simple choices.

1581
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:20,280
We can get all bent out of shape

1582
01:04:20,322 --> 01:04:22,688
intellectualizing or
bench-pressing logic,

1583
01:04:22,724 --> 01:04:25,318
or we can simply relax and enjoy it.

1584
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:27,088
I can listen critically,

1585
01:04:27,195 --> 01:04:30,528
but I don't have to make
up my mind about anything.

1586
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:31,998
But you think you do?

1587
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:34,729
Well, unfortunately, there's
no authorities on prehistory,

1588
01:04:34,803 --> 01:04:36,498
so we couldn't stop him there.

1589
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:38,368
There are experts on the Bible.

1590
01:04:38,406 --> 01:04:39,930
Dream on.

1591
01:04:40,008 --> 01:04:42,306
Yeah, thus the lost years of Jesus.

1592
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:45,006
He didn't exist until John put on a hat.

1593
01:04:45,046 --> 01:04:49,073
I don't believe in angels and the
Nativity and the star in the east,

1594
01:04:49,117 --> 01:04:52,211
but there are stories about
the childhood of Jesus.

1595
01:04:52,254 --> 01:04:54,620
History hates a vacuum.

1596
01:04:54,656 --> 01:04:57,216
Improvisation, some of it very sincere,

1597
01:04:57,259 --> 01:04:58,317
fills the gaps.

1598
01:04:58,426 --> 01:04:59,723
It would have been easy

1599
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:02,559
to falsify a past back then.

1600
01:05:02,664 --> 01:05:05,997
A few words, credulity...
time would do the rest.

1601
01:05:06,067 --> 01:05:08,092
Now you're talking as
if you believed him.

1602
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:10,569
Well, look at the
popular myths surrounding

1603
01:05:10,605 --> 01:05:13,005
the Kennedy assassination
in a few short years.

1604
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:16,043
You had, uh, conspiracy, mafia, CIA.

1605
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:18,978
That's a mystique that'll never go away.

1606
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,880
It's always been a small step
from a fallen leader to a god.

1607
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:25,716
I don't think anybody
will deify Kennedy.

1608
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:27,721
We're more sophisticated than that.

1609
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:29,256
We are?

1610
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,883
We are.

1611
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:36,726
Well, you're finally fulfilling

1612
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:39,028
one prophecy about the millennium, John.

1613
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,965
What's that?

1614
01:05:41,002 --> 01:05:42,833
Here you are again.

1615
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:54,415
You like the fire, John.

1616
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:57,941
Everywhere I've lived,
I've had a fireplace.

1617
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:00,453
Childhood fixation, I guess.

1618
01:06:02,057 --> 01:06:04,082
Helps me to feel secure.

1619
01:06:05,493 --> 01:06:07,552
There are predators out there.

1620
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:11,795
One thing I didn't pack...

1621
01:06:11,866 --> 01:06:13,663
I thought I might need it.

1622
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:24,174
Wouldn't Sacre du printemps
be more appropriate?

1623
01:06:24,212 --> 01:06:25,270
What?

1624
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:28,906
You've got...

1625
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:32,147
four men of science
completely baffled, my friend.

1626
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:34,678
We-We don't know what to make of you.

1627
01:06:34,723 --> 01:06:37,487
Did you know Voltaire
was the first to suggest

1628
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:40,961
that the universe was created
by a gigantic explosion?

1629
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:43,226
I think Paul would agree.

1630
01:06:43,298 --> 01:06:45,698
And then Goethe was the first to suggest

1631
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:49,636
that spiral nebulae were
swirling masses of stars.

1632
01:06:49,704 --> 01:06:51,797
We now call them galaxies.

1633
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,502
It's kind of funny how
often new concepts of science

1634
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:57,476
find their first tentative
forms of expression in the arts.

1635
01:06:57,512 --> 01:07:01,539
So did Beethoven do physics on the side?

1636
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:05,679
He spent most of his
time lying on the floor

1637
01:07:05,754 --> 01:07:07,346
in front of his legless piano

1638
01:07:07,455 --> 01:07:10,151
surrounded by orange
peels and apple cores.

1639
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,158
Now we're on the floor
listening to Beethoven.

1640
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:17,888
Full circle.

1641
01:07:17,966 --> 01:07:20,264
Did you have, um...

1642
01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:23,064
any religious beliefs,

1643
01:07:23,104 --> 01:07:25,334
or did you give it much thought?

1644
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:27,603
You can't get there with thought.

1645
01:07:27,675 --> 01:07:29,267
You have faith?

1646
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:30,868
In a lot of things.

1647
01:07:30,979 --> 01:07:34,005
Do you have faith in
the future of the race?

1648
01:07:34,082 --> 01:07:35,982
I've seen species come and go.

1649
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:38,076
Depends on their balance
with the environment.

1650
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:41,483
We've made a mess of it.

1651
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:43,184
There's still time,

1652
01:07:43,224 --> 01:07:44,816
if we use it well.

1653
01:07:44,893 --> 01:07:47,589
Christianity has been a worldwide belief

1654
01:07:47,629 --> 01:07:49,290
for 2,000 years.

1655
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:51,525
How long did the Egyptians worship Isis

1656
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,123
or the Sumerians Ishtar?

1657
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:55,829
In India, sacred cows wandered freely

1658
01:07:55,904 --> 01:07:57,633
as reincarnated souls.

1659
01:07:57,705 --> 01:07:59,366
In a thousand years,
they'll be barbecued

1660
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:00,999
and their souls will be in squirrels.

1661
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:02,373
You weren't Jesus!

1662
01:08:04,446 --> 01:08:05,640
Oh, Edith.

1663
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:11,180
lf... it rains...
It won't.

1664
01:08:11,252 --> 01:08:12,549
How do you know that?

1665
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:13,952
I don't smell it.

1666
01:08:17,392 --> 01:08:18,359
Were you...

1667
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:21,891
I guess... a medicine man?

1668
01:08:21,963 --> 01:08:24,090
I was a shaman a few times.

1669
01:08:24,165 --> 01:08:27,498
I revealed some truths
to eat a little better.

1670
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:30,561
You think that's all
religion is about...

1671
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:33,096
selling hope and survival?

1672
01:08:33,174 --> 01:08:35,699
The Old Testament sells fear and guilt.

1673
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:38,245
The New Testament is
a good code of ethics,

1674
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,713
put into my mouth by
poets and philosophers

1675
01:08:40,782 --> 01:08:42,841
that are much smarter than I am.

1676
01:08:42,884 --> 01:08:44,909
The message is never practiced.

1677
01:08:46,087 --> 01:08:47,714
Fairy tales build churches.

1678
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:50,917
What about the name "Jesus"?

1679
01:08:50,992 --> 01:08:53,085
Did you pull that out of a hat?

1680
01:08:53,128 --> 01:08:55,460
I called myself John.

1681
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:57,727
I almost always do.

1682
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:59,790
As tales of the resurrection spread,

1683
01:08:59,834 --> 01:09:02,564
the name was confused
with the Hebrew "Yochanan,"

1684
01:09:02,637 --> 01:09:04,400
Meaning "God is gracious."

1685
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:06,168
My stay on Earth was seen

1686
01:09:06,241 --> 01:09:09,870
as divine proof of immortality.

1687
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:13,539
That led to "God is salvation"

1688
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:15,048
or Hebrew "Yahshua,"

1689
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:18,246
which in translation
became my proper name,

1690
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:20,880
changing to late Greek, "lesous,"

1691
01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:23,446
then to late Latin, "lesus,"

1692
01:09:23,491 --> 01:09:26,051
and finally medieval Latin, "Jesus,"

1693
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:29,096
and it was a wonder
to watch it all happen.

1694
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:32,224
Then you didn't claim
to be the son of God?

1695
01:09:32,267 --> 01:09:35,293
Began as a schoolhouse
and ended as a temple.

1696
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,931
I said I had a master that
was greater than myself.

1697
01:09:38,973 --> 01:09:40,941
I never said he was my father.

1698
01:09:40,975 --> 01:09:42,875
I wanted to teach what I learned.

1699
01:09:42,977 --> 01:09:44,968
I never claimed to be king of the Jews,

1700
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:48,173
I never walked on water,
I never raised the dead.

1701
01:09:48,216 --> 01:09:51,515
I never spoke of divine
except in the sense

1702
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:53,679
of human goodness on Earth.

1703
01:09:57,225 --> 01:10:00,820
No wise men came from the
east to worship at a manger.

1704
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:02,921
I did do a little healing

1705
01:10:02,997 --> 01:10:04,828
with some eastern medicine I'd learned.

1706
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:08,727
That's it.

1707
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,405
The three wise men began as a myth

1708
01:10:14,442 --> 01:10:16,307
about the birth of the Buddha.

1709
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:25,008
John, I should be home,
uh, kissing my wife.

1710
01:10:27,222 --> 01:10:29,383
We're all here, trapped by your story...

1711
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:36,626
hoping for a...
revolution? I don't know.

1712
01:10:39,968 --> 01:10:41,902
Are there any, uh...

1713
01:10:41,936 --> 01:10:43,870
more revelations for us?

1714
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,245
It's just like old times.

1715
01:10:58,886 --> 01:11:00,854
You weren't Jesus.

1716
01:11:03,691 --> 01:11:05,989
Quote the sermon on the mount.

1717
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:07,289
Which one?

1718
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:10,525
Darby, King James,
new American standard?

1719
01:11:10,598 --> 01:11:12,361
Do you know them all?

1720
01:11:12,433 --> 01:11:15,596
No one knows the one, not even me.

1721
01:11:15,637 --> 01:11:16,899
I...

1722
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:19,269
I did some teaching on a hill one day.

1723
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,332
Not that many people stayed.

1724
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:22,434
But you...

1725
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:24,501
Biblical Jesus said,

1726
01:11:24,545 --> 01:11:26,979
"Who do you think I am?"

1727
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:29,415
He gave them a choice.

1728
01:11:30,952 --> 01:11:32,317
I'm giving you one.

1729
01:11:35,323 --> 01:11:36,654
Were you?

1730
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,322
If I said no, could you ever be sure?

1731
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:00,413
Turn that off.

1732
01:12:00,448 --> 01:12:01,312
Please.

1733
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:06,410
This has gone far enough.

1734
01:12:06,487 --> 01:12:08,387
It's gone much too far.

1735
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:10,980
These people are very upset.

1736
01:12:11,025 --> 01:12:13,493
I don't believe you're mad,

1737
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:15,824
But what you're saying is not true.

1738
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:19,796
That leaves only one explanation.

1739
01:12:21,002 --> 01:12:23,061
The time has come when you must admit

1740
01:12:23,104 --> 01:12:24,298
this is a hoax...

1741
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:27,201
A lie.

1742
01:12:27,308 --> 01:12:30,869
Isn't that true, John?

1743
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:33,709
If you don't drop this now
- If you can -

1744
01:12:33,748 --> 01:12:35,215
I'll be convinced

1745
01:12:35,316 --> 01:12:38,217
that you need a great deal of attention.

1746
01:12:38,252 --> 01:12:41,187
I can have you committed
for observation.

1747
01:12:41,222 --> 01:12:42,849
You know that.

1748
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,790
I ask you now

1749
01:12:44,826 --> 01:12:46,657
- I demand it -

1750
01:12:46,728 --> 01:12:49,754
that you tell these people the truth.

1751
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:53,062
Give them closure.

1752
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:56,331
It's time, John.

1753
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:57,531
Please.

1754
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:13,915
End of the line. Everybody off.

1755
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:19,125
What?!

1756
01:13:19,193 --> 01:13:21,320
It was a story.

1757
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,489
It was all a story.

1758
01:13:24,499 --> 01:13:25,397
Good God!

1759
01:13:27,201 --> 01:13:28,964
Another fairy tale?

1760
01:13:29,003 --> 01:13:30,698
All of it? But what..?

1761
01:13:30,738 --> 01:13:32,103
What in the name of heaven?

1762
01:13:32,206 --> 01:13:34,401
John, you had us wondering
whether you were sane or not,

1763
01:13:34,442 --> 01:13:36,000
and it's just a story!

1764
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:39,342
Where'd you come off with such
a half-baked, asinine idea?

1765
01:13:39,414 --> 01:13:41,143
At least you're relieved I'm not a nut.

1766
01:13:41,215 --> 01:13:42,807
I'd prefer you were!

1767
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:44,442
You gave me the idea.

1768
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:45,850
All of you.

1769
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,148
Come again?

1770
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:48,779
Edith saw my fake Van Gogh.

1771
01:13:48,823 --> 01:13:50,222
You could have just told me.

1772
01:13:50,258 --> 01:13:51,850
You commented that I never age.

1773
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:53,450
You gave me the book on early man.

1774
01:13:53,528 --> 01:13:55,018
Dan, you spotted the burin

1775
01:13:55,129 --> 01:13:56,756
and you said, "if stones could speak."

1776
01:13:56,831 --> 01:13:58,355
I knew it.

1777
01:13:58,433 --> 01:14:00,833
I got the notion, I ran it past you

1778
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:03,393
to check your reactions,
and I took it too far.

1779
01:14:03,471 --> 01:14:04,768
Too far?

1780
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:06,273
Check my reaction.

1781
01:14:06,307 --> 01:14:08,867
You asked if I was a figure
from religious history,

1782
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:10,377
if there were others like me,

1783
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:11,810
if I'd created future identities.

1784
01:14:11,879 --> 01:14:15,007
We were chasing our
tails around the maypole,

1785
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:18,176
enjoying the mystery,
the analytical stretch.

1786
01:14:18,219 --> 01:14:20,119
You were playing my game!

1787
01:14:20,188 --> 01:14:21,678
I was playing yours.

1788
01:14:21,722 --> 01:14:24,316
Oh, man, you know,
you had us going, right?

1789
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:25,518
You were good, man.

1790
01:14:25,593 --> 01:14:27,026
You know those Chinese boxes,

1791
01:14:27,094 --> 01:14:30,154
one inside the other inside
the other inside the other?

1792
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:33,224
I feel like I'm in the last box.

1793
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:35,531
You son of a...

1794
01:14:35,603 --> 01:14:36,535
bitch!

1795
01:14:36,604 --> 01:14:38,128
How could you do this to us?

1796
01:14:38,206 --> 01:14:40,197
I was worried about you.

1797
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:42,573
I know, I was tempted
to cop out many times,

1798
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,942
But I couldn't resist
seeing whether or not

1799
01:14:45,012 --> 01:14:46,707
you could refute what I was saying.

1800
01:14:46,747 --> 01:14:48,647
I had the perfect audience.

1801
01:14:48,716 --> 01:14:50,547
Anthropologist, archaeologist,

1802
01:14:50,618 --> 01:14:52,643
Christian literalist...

1803
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,813
a psychologist.

1804
01:14:54,856 --> 01:14:56,915
Okay, I've had enough of this.

1805
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,017
I'm outta here.
You wanna come? Let's go.

1806
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:01,287
So, John.

1807
01:15:01,362 --> 01:15:02,954
Are you gonna write the story?

1808
01:15:02,997 --> 01:15:04,589
If I do, I'll send you copies.

1809
01:15:04,665 --> 01:15:06,826
Don't bother with mine, okay?

1810
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:09,063
You are absolutely certifiable.

1811
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:10,798
I don't know you!

1812
01:15:13,174 --> 01:15:15,506
It was nice seeing
you again, Dr. Oldman.

1813
01:15:16,978 --> 01:15:18,707
Your name's a pun, isn't it?

1814
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:19,711
Old man?

1815
01:15:21,616 --> 01:15:24,210
Did that help you with your story?

1816
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:25,809
Linda!

1817
01:15:27,488 --> 01:15:28,580
Bye.

1818
01:15:32,026 --> 01:15:33,994
Well, Art was half right.

1819
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:36,997
Which half?

1820
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,792
Well, at least I don't
have to throw away half

1821
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:44,600
of what I know about biology.

1822
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,231
Which half?

1823
01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:49,901
It's a beautiful idea,

1824
01:15:49,944 --> 01:15:53,812
so rich, so full of possibilities.

1825
01:15:55,116 --> 01:15:57,175
Perhaps you should write
a paper on it, doctor.

1826
01:15:57,218 --> 01:15:58,913
Maybe I will.

1827
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:01,046
I'll interview you in the rubber room

1828
01:16:01,088 --> 01:16:02,555
for further details.

1829
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,649
You may still need help, my friend.

1830
01:16:18,172 --> 01:16:19,571
My ass.

1831
01:16:19,674 --> 01:16:21,767
I thought it sounded pretty good.

1832
01:16:21,809 --> 01:16:23,902
They believe you because they have to.

1833
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:25,969
But the one thing that I know about you

1834
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:27,503
is that you would never use people

1835
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:29,311
or abuse their goodwill and intelligence

1836
01:16:29,383 --> 01:16:31,044
like they think you've
just done to them.

1837
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:32,177
Psych 101?

1838
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:34,779
No, it's woman,
one-on-one.

1839
01:16:34,822 --> 01:16:37,586
So you're a pretty fast liar, Mr. Ugg,

1840
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:40,321
But I wanna know:
What's your real name?

1841
01:16:40,394 --> 01:16:45,331
Believe it or not, the
sound was always John.

1842
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:47,264
Why'd you cave to Gruber?

1843
01:16:47,301 --> 01:16:48,928
What happened was enough.

1844
01:16:49,003 --> 01:16:50,493
Just-just needed to stop.

1845
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:52,732
I shouldn't have expected it to work.

1846
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:56,075
Fourteen thousand years old.

1847
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,044
I bet that's a lot of women.

1848
01:16:58,112 --> 01:17:00,046
Are we counting?

1849
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:01,342
Maybe.

1850
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:05,376
Well, I'm taking Edith home.

1851
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:06,351
Sandy?

1852
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:09,246
I'm gonna stay.

1853
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,990
Are you sorry for some
of those things you said?

1854
01:17:16,063 --> 01:17:18,554
I'm sorry I said them.

1855
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:19,998
Well.

1856
01:17:20,067 --> 01:17:21,534
Like a good Christian,

1857
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:24,697
I... oh, John.

1858
01:17:24,772 --> 01:17:26,569
Oh! Well.

1859
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:29,972
You did a terrible thing,

1860
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:32,377
but we're all so
thankful you're all right.

1861
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,506
Even Art. He just hates
things he can't understand.

1862
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:37,278
You're a sadist, John,

1863
01:17:37,385 --> 01:17:39,410
But I admit I got a kick out of

1864
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:41,216
chasing my tail around your maypole...

1865
01:17:41,288 --> 01:17:43,415
Even if that is all I caught.

1866
01:17:43,491 --> 01:17:44,583
Good luck to you.

1867
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:46,183
Wish you the best. Thank you.

1868
01:17:46,227 --> 01:17:47,216
Ready?

1869
01:17:56,303 --> 01:17:58,134
Later on.
Okay, good night.

1870
01:18:00,975 --> 01:18:01,839
Mm-hmm.

1871
01:18:05,246 --> 01:18:06,440
Mmm.

1872
01:18:06,547 --> 01:18:09,380
I don't know, man.

1873
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,418
Something about this...

1874
01:18:11,452 --> 01:18:13,682
something about you, John.

1875
01:18:13,754 --> 01:18:15,881
The more I think about it,

1876
01:18:15,956 --> 01:18:18,789
the more I'm no longer
in that Chinese box.

1877
01:18:20,761 --> 01:18:22,558
I sense... space.

1878
01:18:22,596 --> 01:18:27,499
A kinda latitude of what
we happily call reality,

1879
01:18:27,568 --> 01:18:30,560
in which, as everybody keeps saying...

1880
01:18:31,906 --> 01:18:33,601
anything's possible.

1881
01:18:33,674 --> 01:18:35,539
Yes. No, no. No, no.

1882
01:18:35,576 --> 01:18:37,373
No. No more words.

1883
01:18:37,411 --> 01:18:39,106
I'm gonna go home,

1884
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,977
and I'm gonna watch Star Trek

1885
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:43,074
for a dose of sanity.

1886
01:18:43,117 --> 01:18:45,108
Good luck to you, man,

1887
01:18:45,186 --> 01:18:47,586
wherever this may lead you.

1888
01:18:47,621 --> 01:18:49,987
You drop me a line sometime.

1889
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:51,821
Let me know how you're making out.

1890
01:18:53,427 --> 01:18:54,394
I will.

1891
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,673
So, John Oldman.

1892
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:11,303
What other pun names have you used?

1893
01:19:11,345 --> 01:19:12,642
Lots.

1894
01:19:14,181 --> 01:19:17,241
John Paley for John Paleolithic,

1895
01:19:17,284 --> 01:19:19,650
John Savage...

1896
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:21,780
Got really crazy about 60 years ago,

1897
01:19:21,856 --> 01:19:23,653
when I was teaching at Harvard,

1898
01:19:23,691 --> 01:19:26,455
I was John Thomas Partee.

1899
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,051
John T. Partee -
Boston tea party.

1900
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:30,256
I get it.

1901
01:19:30,297 --> 01:19:31,491
Yeah, I know.

1902
01:19:31,565 --> 01:19:32,691
Wait, wait, wait.

1903
01:19:32,767 --> 01:19:35,065
Boston?

1904
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:37,195
60 years ago?

1905
01:19:37,271 --> 01:19:39,364
J-John Partee?

1906
01:19:43,277 --> 01:19:47,805
You did not teach chemistry!
I do not believe you!

1907
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,677
Your mother's name was Nola.

1908
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:52,913
No. Yeah.

1909
01:19:52,987 --> 01:19:54,978
No.

1910
01:19:55,022 --> 01:19:57,490
Yes, Nola.

1911
01:19:57,525 --> 01:19:59,186
My mother!

1912
01:20:00,528 --> 01:20:02,120
I reject this!

1913
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:05,722
My-My-My dog's name.

1914
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:08,734
We had him before I was born.

1915
01:20:08,803 --> 01:20:09,735
Woofie.

1916
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:11,135
Woof, woof, woofie...

1917
01:20:16,644 --> 01:20:18,578
Gruber. She remarried?

1918
01:20:18,612 --> 01:20:20,546
She said you abandoned us.

1919
01:20:21,615 --> 01:20:23,242
Sorry, I had to move on.

1920
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:25,046
You know that. I left enough.

1921
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:27,212
- I left enough.
- I'm cold.

1922
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:29,347
Chilly Willy, always cold.

1923
01:20:29,423 --> 01:20:31,414
Never could stand the cold.

1924
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:35,155
Wait, you... you had a beard.

1925
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:36,821
Yeah, you used to tug on it

1926
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,388
to see if it was real.

1927
01:20:38,432 --> 01:20:39,956
Agh! Will!

1928
01:20:40,034 --> 01:20:40,864
God.

1929
01:20:42,336 --> 01:20:43,735
911, now!

1930
01:20:45,739 --> 01:20:47,536
Come on, Will.

1931
01:20:47,575 --> 01:20:48,667
Will.

1932
01:20:48,742 --> 01:20:49,674
Come on, buddy.

1933
01:21:21,842 --> 01:21:23,901
You'll stay in touch, Dr. Oldman,

1934
01:21:23,944 --> 01:21:26,037
in case there are any questions.

1935
01:21:26,113 --> 01:21:28,172
I'll be back for the funeral.

1936
01:21:28,215 --> 01:21:29,204
Miss.

1937
01:21:39,526 --> 01:21:41,653
You never saw a grown child die.

1938
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:44,062
No.
