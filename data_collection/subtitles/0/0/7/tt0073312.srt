{2522}{2597}How I got into this predicament,|I'll never know.
{2600}{2649}Absolutely incredible.
{2652}{2733}To be executed fora crime|I never committed.
{2737}{2803}Of course,|isn't all mankind in the same boat?
{2806}{2897}Isn't all mankind ultimately executed|for a crime it never committed?
{2908}{2971}The difference is|that all men go eventually,
{2974}{3029}but I go six o'clock tomorrow morning.
{3032}{3141}I was supposed to go at five o'clock,|but I have a smart lawyer. Got leniency.
{3156}{3217}I've a tremendous yearning|to be young again.
{3228}{3334}A boy. Such happy memories|at oursummerhouse.
{3337}{3407}Uncle Nikolai with his wonderful laugh.
{3612}{3659}God, he was repulsive.
{3663}{3746}There was Grandpa and Grandma,|who had been married for 50 years
{3749}{3839}and still felt as deeply about one another|as the day they met.
{3880}{3961}And my own father,|a handsome and generous man.
{3964}{4073}In addition to oursummerand winter|estate, he owned a valuable piece ofland.
{4076}{4196}True, it was a small piece. But he carried|it with him whereverhe went.
{4206}{4293}Dimitri Pietrovich!|I would like to buy your land.
{4297}{4367}This land is not for sale.
{4369}{4460}Some day, I hope to build on it.
{4464}{4527}He was an idiot. But I loved him.
{4530}{4643}Then there was mother, who made|the most delicious blintzes in the world.
{4704}{4780}Of course, there was Old Gregor,|and his son, Young Gregor.
{4784}{4851}Young Gregor's son|was older than Old Gregor.
{4854}{4926}Nobody could figure out|how that happened.
{4929}{5021}My two brothers, Ivan and Mikhail,|used to play amusing little games.
{5025}{5108}But I had a completely different|concept of myself as a child.
{5174}{5290}My first experience with death|was with one ofourserfs, Old Nehamkin.
{5307}{5420}Old Nehamkin was on the roof, putting up|a lightning rod, when a storm broke out.
{5439}{5520}After he failed to show up for dinner,|Mother went to look forhim.
{5523}{5611}What is it? Old Nehamkin?|You're not looking well.
{5614}{5686}Are you OK? You feel all right?
{5696}{5747}We laid Old Nehamkin to rest,
{5750}{5817}and that night|I had a strange and vivid dream.
{6395}{6510}I knew that after that dream I would|not grow up to be an ordinary man.
{6513}{6564}I spoke often with FatherNikolai,
{6568}{6636}who was always dressed in black|with a black beard.
{6639}{6698}For years|I thought he was an Italian widow.
{6701}{6803}Every action has a cause. The universe|exists, therefore it has a cause.
{6806}{6885}It follows God created the universe,|therefore He exists.
{6888}{6957}And yet Spinoza didn't believe|in the Holy Trinity.
{6961}{7012}- Spinoza was a Jew.|- What's a Jew?
{7015}{7110}You never saw a Jew?|Here. I have some sketches.
{7149}{7238}- There are Jews.|- No kidding.
{7241}{7333}- They all have these horns?|- No, this is the Russian Jew.
{7336}{7398}The German Jew has these stripes.
{7401}{7462}I recall my first mystical vision.
{7465}{7525}I was in the woods, thinking about Christ.
{7528}{7616}If he was a carpenter, I wondered|what he'd charge forbook shelves?
{7620}{7655}Suddenly...
{7676}{7729}- Who are you?|- Death.
{7743}{7793}What happens after we die?
{7796}{7860}Is there a hell? Is there a God?
{7887}{7940}Do we live again?
{7943}{8028}All right. Let me ask one key question.
{8054}{8151}- Are there girls?|- You're an interesting young man.
{8155}{8200}We'll meet again.
{8202}{8268}- Don't bother.|- It's no bother.
{8310}{8384}I grew to full manhood.|Actually, five foot six,
{8387}{8488}which is technically not full manhood|in Russia, but you can own property.
{8492}{8598}Over 5'3", you can own land. Under 5'3",|you needpermission from the Tsar.
{9169}{9221}We were three healthy men.
{9224}{9273}My brotherlvan.
{9332}{9381}My brotherMikhail.
{9427}{9476}And myself.
{9597}{9654}Finally, there was my cousin Sonja.
{9657}{9742}In addition to being the most beautiful|woman I had everseen,
{9745}{9850}she was one ofthe fewpeople|I could have deep conversations with.
{9873}{9963}Boris, look at this leaf. Isn't it perfect?
{9976}{10029}And this one? Look.
{10033}{10146}Oh, yeah. I definitely think that|this is the best of all possible worlds.
{10149}{10240}- It's certainly the most expensive.|- Isn't nature incredible?
{10269}{10359}To me, nature is... I dunno,|spiders and bugs and,
{10362}{10411}big fish eating little fish.
{10414}{10501}And plants eating plants|and animals eating...
{10504}{10553}It's like an enormous restaurant.
{10556}{10630}Yes, but if God created it,|it has to be beautiful,
{10633}{10700}even if His plan's not apparent|to us at the moment.
{10703}{10760}Sonja, what if there is no God?
{10764}{10823}Boris Dimitrovitch, are you joking?
{10826}{10889}What if we're just|a bunch of absurd people
{10892}{10958}who are running around|with no rhyme or reason?
{10960}{11027}But if there is no God,|then life has no meaning.
{11030}{11102}Why go on living?|Why not just commit suicide?
{11105}{11173}Well, Iet's not get hysterical.|I could be wrong.
{11176}{11252}I'd hate to blow my brains out,|then see they found something.
{11255}{11334}Boris. Let me show you|how absurd your position is.
{11347}{11457}Let's say there is no God, and each man|is free to do exactly as he chooses.
{11460}{11524}What prevents you|from murdering somebody?
{11527}{11609}- Murder's immoral.|- Immorality is subjective.
{11612}{11665}Yes, but subjectivity is objective.
{11678}{11729}Not in a rational scheme of perception.
{11732}{11792}Perception is irrational.|It implies imminence.
{11795}{11888}But judgment of any system|of phenomena exists
{11892}{11980}in any rational, metaphysical or|epistemological contradiction
{11984}{12096}to an abstracted empirical concept|such as being, or to be, or to occur
{12099}{12157}in the thing itself, or of the thing itself.
{12161}{12209}Yeah, I've said that many times.
{12212}{12298}Boris, we must believe in God.
{12311}{12407}If I could just see a miracle,|just one miracle.
{12410}{12521}If I could see a burning bush,|or the seas part, or...
{12523}{12591}Or my Uncle Sasha pick up a check.
{12629}{12702}We should go back downstairs.
{12706}{12774}By now|the last golden streaks of the sunset
{12777}{12848}are vanishing behind the western hills.
{12851}{12955}Soon the dark blanket of night|shall settle over us all.
{12958}{13043}Hey, you've been going|to finishing school.
{13073}{13174}Hey, are you dating any Russians|I should know about?
{13199}{13250}Well, Minskov has proposed.
{13254}{13302}And he's very sweet and wealthy.
{13306}{13384}But the age difference is too great.|I'm 28 and he's 81.
{13387}{13494}- Oh, that is big.|- When I'm 50" he'll be 103.
{13497}{13546}That's a bad age for a man. They slow up.
{13548}{13608}And Voskovec|has made his intentions clear.
{13611}{13678}But he deals in herring,|and he always smells of it.
{13681}{13740}He even bought me|herring-scented cologne.
{13743}{13805}That's probably|why the cat follows you around.
{13808}{13856}Love is everything, Boris.
{13859}{13939}I wanna meet some man|and scale the heights of passion.
{13943}{14031}Some man who embodies|the three great aspects of love.
{14035}{14125}Intellectual, spiritual and sensual.
{14128}{14227}Well, there's not too many of us|around, but it can be done.
{14243}{14325}- So many women settle cheaply.|- I know. Poor things.
{14328}{14406}- They marry for money.|- Money! Well, money.
{14409}{14475}But I feel as though|my life would be wasted
{14479}{14565}if I didn't love deeply|with a man whose mind I respected,
{14568}{14620}whose spirituality equalled mine,
{14623}{14692}and who had the same lustful appetite
{14695}{14765}for sensual passion that drives me insane.
{14779}{14836}You're an incredibly complex woman.
{14849}{14942}I guess you could say|I'm half saint, half whore.
{14953}{15004}Here's hoping I get the half that eats.
{15007}{15052}- Boris.|- Yes?
{15055}{15108}I have a confession to make.
{15118}{15200}Ever since you and I were little children,
{15203}{15261}I've been in love with your brother Ivan.
{15264}{15306}It's only nat...
{15310}{15420}Ivan? You're kidding! He can barely write|his name in the ground with a stick.
{15423}{15469}He has true animal magnetism.
{15472}{15558}All that talk about some perfect love|and you're hot for Ivan?
{15561}{15616}- He kissed me.|- Any place I should know?
{15619}{15717}- It warmed the cockles of my heart.|- Great. Nothing like hot cockles.
{15720}{15768}I think he's going to propose to me.
{15772}{15857}But he's a gambler and a drinker,|with a Neanderthal mentality.
{15860}{15939}I mean, I love him like a brother.|Just not one of mine.
{15943}{16014}Do you hear that commotion?|What's going on downstairs?
{16032}{16104}Have you heard the news?|Napoleon has invaded Austria.
{16107}{16206}- Why? Is he out of Courvoisier?|- A chance to taste the glories of battle.
{16209}{16254}Check with me when it's over...
{16258}{16363}- No, Boris. You're going to fight.|- You're gonna have your head examined.
{16366}{16446}- We leave the day after tomorrow.|- Fellas, I'm a pacifist.
{16449}{16544}- I don't believe in war.|- He doesn't believe in war.
{16547}{16603}Napoleon, he believes in war.
{16606}{16695}What are you going to do when|the French soldiers rape your sister?
{16698}{16750}- I don't have one.|- That's no answer.
{16753}{16861}- They won't rape Ivan. They'd throw up.|- Don't disgrace me in front of my friends.
{16864}{16963}What good is war? We kill Frenchmen,|they kill Russians, then it's Easter.
{16966}{17028}Boris, you're talking about Mother Russia.
{17031}{17142}She's not my mother. My mother wouldn't|let her youngest get shrapnel in his gums.
{17145}{17242}- Get away from me.|- I can't believe what I'm seeing.
{17245}{17344}- He has a yellow streak down his back.|- No, it runs across.
{17347}{17416}- Boris, you're a coward.|- Yes, but a militant coward.
{17419}{17502}Boris. Medals... We'll get medals.
{17506}{17581}Take it easy, Ivan.|You've got to cut down on your raw meat.
{17585}{17644}He'll go and he'll fight.
{17647}{17730}And I hope they will put him|in the front lines.
{17733}{17793}Thanks a lot, Mum. My mother, folks.
{17833}{17924}This is crazy. I can't shoot a gun.|I was meant to write poetry.
{17927}{18016}Sonja, I'm not the army type.|I slept with the light on till I was 30.
{18020}{18067}I can't shower with other men.
{18070}{18131}Friends. My friends.
{18162}{18267}On the eve of this glorious occasion,|I have an announcement to make.
{18281}{18427}Because we go into battle, perhaps|never to see our loved ones again,
{18430}{18517}I wish to announce|that tomorrow I intend to marry.
{18555}{18658}I'm going to take as my bride|a woman I have grown up with.
{18690}{18734}Anna Ivanova.
{18779}{18828}Ivan.
{18831}{18919}I'm sorry. I should have told you.
{18972}{19034}I also have an announcement to make.
{19037}{19103}Tomorrow, I too get married.
{19121}{19191}I have been proposed to|and have accepted the hand of
{19194}{19282}Sergei Ivanovich Minskov.
{19450}{19569}Yes... I mean Leonid Voskovec,|the herring merchant.
{21280}{21329}You! Get out here!
{21548}{21625}You're the worst soldier I ever seen.
{21642}{21713}- You ignorammus!|- Ignoramus, sir.
{21716}{21798}- You want a dishonourable discharge?|- Yes, sir. Or a furlough.
{21800}{21865}Goddamn you!|You love Russia, don't you?
{21868}{21915}- Yessir.|- Louder!
{21918}{21962}- You like it here?|- Yessir!
{21965}{22065}- You want to make a career in the army?|- Well, Iet's not get carried away.
{22068}{22124}You can clean the mess hall|and the latrine!
{22127}{22176}Yessir. How will I tell the difference?
{22179}{22206}OK.
{22209}{22282}One, two! One, two! One, two!
{22285}{22354}Three is next, if you're having any trouble.
{23542}{23628}Naturally, the war affects|the herring industry.
{23631}{23679}The ports are blockaded.
{23683}{23776}Fresh shipments of the herring|become more difficult to obtain.
{23780}{23870}And, of course, when something|hurts herring, it hurts me.
{23910}{23959}What people don't understand
{23962}{24028}is that there are hundreds|of types of herring,
{24031}{24100}each with its own interesting history.
{24130}{24185}Sonja. Are you OK?
{24258}{24305}Oh, yes.
{24308}{24346}But I've talked long enough.
{24349}{24467}Why don't you two play, as I have got|some important business to attend to?
{24479}{24532}A capital idea.
{24582}{24642}Ready? And a one and a two...
{24645}{24688}And...
{25059}{25111}- You stopped.|- What would you think
{25114}{25248}if I told you you were one of the most|beautiful women I have ever seen?
{25266}{25372}I'd think what a mad fool he is.
{25375}{25479}And what would you say|if I suddenly put my arms around you?
{25482}{25570}I'd think what a mad,|impetuous fool he is.
{25584}{25654}And what would you think if I kissed you?
{25657}{25754}I'd think what a mad,|impetuous, wonderful fool he is.
{25786}{25827}- Don't!|- I must!
{25829}{25909}- We just ate.|- Your skin, it is so beautiful.
{25912}{25965}Yes, I know. It covers my whole body.
{25968}{26014}I must have you.
{26017}{26088}No, not on the piano. It's a rented piano.
{26091}{26155}Darling, my darling, my...
{26170}{26209}Sonja!
{26222}{26290}Sonja, did you see a jar of wine sauce?
{26384}{26450}- Come to my quarters tomorrow at three.|- I can't.
{26453}{26514}- Please!|- It's immoral. What time?
{26517}{26607}- Who is to say what is moral?|- Morality is subjective.
{26610}{26667}Subjectivity is objective.
{26670}{26737}Moral notions imply attributes|to substances
{26740}{26795}which exist only in relational duality.
{26798}{26894}Not as an essential extension|of ontological existence.
{26897}{26957}Can we not talk about sex so much?
{26960}{27036}- I'm terribly sorry.|- You'd better go.
{27039}{27091}- Sonja, please.|- No, I mean it.
{27195}{27236}Men...
{27239}{27315}Next week, we leave for the front.
{27318}{27401}The object will be to kill|as many Frenchmen as possible.
{27421}{27515}Naturally, they are going to try|and kill as many Russians as possible.
{27531}{27607}If we kill more Frenchmen, we win.
{27622}{27701}If they kill more Russians, they win.
{27704}{27750}What do we win?
{27780}{27840}What do we win, Private?
{27854}{27932}Imagine your loved ones|conquered by Napoleon
{27935}{27996}and forced to live under French rule.
{27999}{28092}Do you want them to eat|that rich food and those heavy sauces?
{28095}{28143}No.
{28146}{28232}Do you want them to have|souffl every meal and croissant?
{28235}{28278}No.
{28281}{28398}Men, since you are all getting a three-day|furlough before going into battle,
{28401}{28484}we would like to show you|this little hygiene play.
{28552}{28627}Goodbye. I hope you had a good time.
{28630}{28679}I did. I had a good time.
{28740}{28832}What's this sore on my lip?|I'd better see the doctor.
{28847}{28898}Doc, I have this sore on my lip.
{28901}{28973}- You have a social disease, my friend.|- Oh, my God.
{28977}{29047}If you do not treat it, you will go blind.
{29051}{29099}Or insane!
{29178}{29266}Well, men. That is the end of the play.
{29270}{29347}Have a good time on your furlough,|but look after yourselves!
{29350}{29449}- Well, what did you think of the play?|- It was weak. I was never interested.
{29452}{29509}Although the doctor|was played with gusto.
{29512}{29561}The girl had a delightful cameo role.
{29564}{29670}A satire of contemporary mores, a spoof|aimed more at the heart than the head.
{29673}{29744}I'm planning to spend|the next three days in a brothel.
{29747}{29840}- Can't you come with me?|- No. I went to a brothel once in my life.
{29843}{29892}I got hiccups. It was over like that.
{29895}{29960}And there's someone I must see|in Saint Petersburg.
{29963}{30005}Well, have fun.
{30092}{30186}I think the Magic Flute|is Mozart's greatest opera.
{30189}{30263}It's a hell of an opera, isn't it?|Do they sell popcorn?
{30266}{30345}We're so delighted you decided|to spend your furlough with us.
{30349}{30399}You were always our favourite nephew.
{30402}{30456}Even though you are|an incredible coward.
{30459}{30508}Thank you so much.
{30537}{30582}Any news of cousin Sonja?
{30585}{30684}Only that she and Voskovec|are unhappy and she takes lovers.
{30687}{30738}- She takes uppers?|- Lovers.
{30741}{30794}Oh, Iovers.
{30804}{30853}Hey. Who is that?
{30909}{30988}That's the Countess Alexandrovna.
{30991}{31063}One of the most enticing women|in Saint Petersburg.
{31080}{31136}Ample bosoms, yes?
{31139}{31185}I'd say ample for a regiment.
{31188}{31237}She's recently widowed.
{31240}{31308}They say her husband, the Count,|died in her arms
{31311}{31403}trying to satisfy|her prodigious sexual desires.
{31406}{31490}No kidding! Died smiling, I bet.
{31493}{31563}Who,s the character with her|with the wry moustache?
{31566}{31655}That's Anton Ivanovich Lebedokov,|her current lover.
{31658}{31709}Although the way she's staring at you...
{31712}{31761}I could work something out with him.
{31765}{31841}I'd let him warm her up.|I could come in and finish her.
{31844}{31961}You must be careful of Anton Ivanovich.|He has a furious temper.
{31964}{32039}- Really?|- He has killed several men in duels.
{32042}{32117}All in a jealous rage over the Countess.
{32120}{32199}Glad you mentioned it.|Think I'll watch the opera.
{33526}{33596}Ah, there is something about Mozart!
{33599}{33672}Well, I think you're probably|responding to his music.
{33725}{33790}Couldn't you be careful?
{33810}{33858}I believe...
{33870}{33932}I believe that the lobby of...
{33972}{34034}I believe that the lobby of the St Pete...
{34081}{34162}Opera House|is one of the most beautiful in Europe.
{34237}{34302}Who is this attractive|and mysterious soldier?
{34305}{34339}Boris Grushenko.
{34364}{34447}- Sorry. I goosed that lady.|- He has quite a sensitive face.
{34451}{34498}That's the part of me that shows.
{34501}{34602}Grushenko. Isn't he the young coward|all Saint Petersburg is talking about?
{34605}{34683}- Not so young. I'm 35.|- The one so afraid for his own safety,
{34686}{34734}he won't defend his country?
{34737}{34802}He is in a bad mood.|Don't you like your seats?
{34816}{34903}You must visit me for tea.|I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about.
{34906}{34952}OK. I'll bring the tea bags.
{34955}{35013}We could run a check|on your erogenous zones.
{35016}{35105}- What about the dybbuk?|- Why do you always taunt me in public?
{35142}{35199}If you so much as|come near the Countess,
{35202}{35260}I'll see that you never see daylight again.
{35263}{35335}If a man said that to me,|I'd break his neck!
{35338}{35448}- I am a man.|- Well, I mean a much shorter man.
{35475}{35551}Boris! Boris Dimitrovitch!
{35554}{35579}Sonja!
{35684}{35758}Look at you.|You look so handsome in your uniform.
{35761}{35835}I got a perfect build for clothes.|I'm a 28 dwarf.
{35838}{35944}And you, Sonja, you look more beautiful|standing here than you do in person.
{35947}{36020}- Oh, Boris, I'm so unhappy.|- I wish you weren't.
{36023}{36078}Voskovec and I quarrel frequently.
{36081}{36136}- I've become a scandal.|- Poor Sonja.
{36139}{36210}I've been visiting Seretsky in his room.
{36220}{36288}Why? What's in his room?
{36304}{36392}And before Seretsky, Alexei.|And before Alexei, Alegorian.
{36395}{36455}- And before Alegorian, Asimov.|- OK!
{36458}{36507}Wait! I'm still on the A's.
{36510}{36578}- How many lovers do you have?|- In the midtown area?
{36592}{36684}- Oh, Sonja.|- Boris, my life is ruined. Over.
{36687}{36759}I can't stand Voskovec.
{36762}{36888}His mentality has reduced all the beauty|of the world to a small pickled fish.
{36892}{36968}Sonja, you need somebody|to take you away from Voskovec.
{36971}{37083}Someone who loves you. Someone who's|always loved you and cared for you.
{37108}{37157}How is your brother Ivan?
{37185}{37288}- Ivan's all right.|- Yes? Ivan is well?
{37291}{37384}Ivan's a tiger. He did his basic training|in two weeks. Became a major.
{37395}{37464}- Does he ever speak of me?|- Sonja, he's busy.
{37467}{37530}Well, he must!|He must speak of me sometimes.
{37533}{37601}Take it easy, will you?|This is army property.
{37604}{37706}He... Once he was sick... He was delirious.|He called your name out.
{37709}{37758}Really? Then there's hope.
{37779}{37863}Look. Tomorrow, my regiment pulls out.|We're going to the front.
{37867}{37970}We're outnumbered by the French.|It's unlikely that any of us will come back.
{37973}{38058}- Exactly what did he say about me?|- Sonja!
{38070}{38185}Now, where did you say you were going?|Oh, yes, the war. Well...
{38188}{38269}Dress warmly, Boris,|and have a nice time.
{38506}{38592}The idea is not to panic and run,|then they shoot you in the back.
{38595}{38669}I don't want to be trampled by a horse.|And you, Boris?
{38672}{38736}I wouldn't mind.|I don't even want to fight.
{38739}{38809}It's no different living|under the Tsar or Napoleon.
{38812}{38864}They're both crooks. The Tsar's taller.
{38868}{38949}If you don't like Napoleon|and you don't like the Tsar,
{38952}{39007}who do you think should run the country?
{39010}{39078}- Do you really wanna know? The serfs.|- Oh, the serfs.
{39081}{39129}Only they know how to do things.
{39132}{39206}A fence needs putting up,|it's always the serfs.
{39210}{39270}He wants the serfs to run the country.
{39291}{39369}Why not the criminal element?|Or the Jews?
{39372}{39479}Some Jews are smart. Though I hear their|women don't practise sex after marriage.
{39482}{39531}- Are you married, Boris?|- Me? No.
{39534}{39643}- You got a sweetheart?|- No. I'm in love with a girl. She's married.
{39647}{39734}She's in love with someone and he's|married. It's a real healthy situation.
{39737}{39786}Hey, look, Boris. Look.
{39789}{39866}- What have you got there?|- I got a lock of my wife's hair.
{39870}{39950}A lock of her hair.|Jeez, she's probably running around bald.
{39953}{40052}Don't drop it. Have you got|a lock of your sweetheart's hair?
{40055}{40137}No. She's married.|But I got a lock of her husband's hair.
{40267}{40343}Boy, this army cooking'll|get you every time.
{40353}{40419}There's Visinksy. He was from my village.
{40422}{40503}- He was the village idiot.|- Yeah, what did you do? Place?
{40506}{40555}Oh, God is testing us.
{40599}{40677}If he's gonna test us,|why doesn't he give us a written?
{41556}{41640}Wow! The battle looks completely|different in the middle of it
{41643}{41720}than it does|to the generals up on the hill.
{42243}{42297}Hey, get your red-hots.
{42300}{42395}- You got anything to drink?|- The guy with the beer's coming.
{42398}{42470}You got something smaller than that?|I just started.
{43003}{43062}We started the battle with 12,000 men.
{43065}{43127}When it was over, we had 14 survivors.
{43130}{43214}We got a message from the Tsar|saying "Keep up the good work."
{43217}{43338}That night, as I was burying bodies,|I had anothermystical experience.
{43341}{43390}Mercifully, God was on our side.
{43393}{43477}It could have gone a lot worse|if he wasn't. It might have rained.
{43480}{43532}Grushenko!
{43535}{43634}- Vladimir Maximovitch. You're alive.|- No, I'm dead. Look at this hole.
{43643}{43718}- Oh, does it hurt?|- I feel nothing.
{43731}{43832}You don't look so bad for a guy|who's dead. I think it agrees with you.
{43835}{43887}- Listen, do me a favour.|- Anything.
{43890}{43982}This engagement ring, I was gonna|give it to my girlfriend. A surprise.
{43985}{44057}- You want me to give it to her?|- No, what's the point?
{44060}{44162}Take it back to the jeweller's in Smolensk.|Vladimir Petroshnik.
{44166}{44215}Tell him I'm dead and get a refund.
{44218}{44284}- OK. What did you give him for this?|- 1600 roubles.
{44286}{44405}- For this you gave him 1600 roubles?|- This is a diamond with two baguettes...
{44408}{44484}This is insane!|I could have gotten you this ring for 1200.
{44487}{44557}- Never that ring. Never.|- The exact same ring.
{44560}{44627}Anyway. Listen, take the deposit.
{44631}{44672}- Go to Kiev.|- Right.
{44676}{44754}- Give it to a woman, Natasha Petrovna.|- Right. OK.
{44757}{44810}Get a receipt.|Make sure you get a receipt.
{44813}{44879}- Why do you need that? You're dead.|- Tax purposes.
{44882}{44934}Oh! Good thinking.
{44963}{45048}- What happened?|- He was cleaning his pistol. It went off.
{45051}{45127}- The bullet has lodged in his heart.|- Is it serious?
{45130}{45220}With proper medical care,|he could last another ten minutes.
{45273}{45343}Why were you cleaning your pistol?
{45366}{45471}I was going to fight a duel|to defend your honour.
{45491}{45588}A Turkish cavalry officer|cast aspersions on it.
{45591}{45642}He said you were sleeping around.
{45659}{45757}I knew he was lying, that you were pure.
{46049}{46088}Yes, well...
{46091}{46161}Leonid, I know I could have been|a better wife to you.
{46164}{46250}Kinder. I could have made love|with you more often.
{46253}{46342}- Or once, even.|- Once would have been nice.
{46345}{46423}You were a kind and loving husband.
{46426}{46494}Generous and always considerate.
{46497}{46545}What's he got? About eight minutes?
{46548}{46619}I think I'm slow. He's got about three.
{46642}{46776}Swimming out to the open sea|like the great wild herring.
{46835}{46926}I realise this must be|a great blow to you, Sonja.
{46941}{47038}But you must not allow yourself|to be consumed with grief.
{47063}{47112}The dead pass on,
{47130}{47196}and life is for the living.
{47207}{47251}I guess you're right.
{47254}{47300}Where do you wanna eat?
{47303}{47352}- Let's go to Rykoff's.|- No, no, no.
{47355}{47433}- Why?|- I feel like meat, not a cheese sandwich.
{47435}{47484}It's not good for your health.
{47488}{47589}There's a tavern at the edge of the square|makes a sausage that's wonderful.
{47592}{47639}Meanwhile, the war continued.
{47642}{47752}My regiment had been wiped out and|I found myselflost behind enemy lines.
{47792}{47843}I panicked, and hid where I could.
{47850}{47902}Then I fainted.
{47905}{47985}When I came to, I realised|I had made a terrible mistake.
{48889}{48966}As fate would have it, I landed|on a group ofFrench generals,
{48969}{49048}causing theirimmediate surrender,|and making me a hero.
{49051}{49150}My brotherlvan was not so lucky.|He was a fatality ofwar.
{49153}{49257}He had been bayoneted to death|by a Polish conscientious objector.
{49425}{49476}You're praying for Ivan?
{49479}{49550}Yes. Your husband.
{49553}{49602}I loved him, as you know.
{49619}{49709}I wanted you|to have some of his possessions.
{49712}{49761}How kind.
{49778}{49887}I kept his sword, and gold watch.
{49924}{49974}But, here,
{49978}{50050}I'm giving you his moustache.
{50065}{50114}I'll cherish it.
{50134}{50182}Also,
{50185}{50234}some string.
{50251}{50300}Ivan saved string.
{50303}{50399}I know.|It was one of the reasons why I loved him.
{50418}{50467}I understand that.
{50489}{50557}I loved him for his string, too.
{50566}{50626}Anything else for me?
{50658}{50738}I thought we should divide his letters.
{50779}{50841}Do you want|the vowels or the consonants?
{50844}{50890}His vowels.
{50893}{50960}You keep the consonants.
{50977}{51044}Life is unbearable.
{51077}{51158}- So we meet again.|- Countess Alexandrovna.
{51209}{51289}I wish there was a way to thank you|for what you've done for Russia.
{51301}{51407}- I may be able to think of something.|- Maybe we could meet in my room later.
{51410}{51471}As you wish. How's five minutes?
{51474}{51533}Well. What have we here?
{51536}{51610}- Still dating laughing boy, huh?|- Back from the war, I see.
{51614}{51682}I'd have stayed longer,|but they ran out of medals.
{51685}{51759}I understand|your heroism was quite inadvertent.
{51776}{51849}You should have|such inadvertent heroism.
{51852}{51958}- Are you still talking to this strutting ass?|- Careful. It's a trick question.
{51961}{52066}Fetch my carriage, Lebedokov.|I'll join you momentarily.
{52090}{52143}Nice seeing you again, Quasimodo.
{52158}{52240}- My room at midnight?|- Perfect. Will you be there, too?
{52243}{52297}- Naturally.|- Until midnight, then.
{52300}{52349}Midnight.
{52389}{52442}- Make it a quarter to twelve.|- Midnight.
{52445}{52511}- Midnight.|- Boris, you hardly touched your blini!
{52513}{52592}Yes, well... I've been sick, you know...
{52681}{52730}Come in!
{52917}{52967}How do you like it?
{52970}{53043}It's all right.|I prefer something sexy, but...
{53070}{53183}Would you like some wine?|Something to put you in the mood.
{53197}{53288}Oh, I've been in the mood|since the late 1700s.
{53301}{53367}You're disgusting, but I love you.
{53376}{53448}Well, my disgustingness|is my best feature.
{53506}{53555}It must be lonely at the front.
{53558}{53640}How long has it been|since you've made love to a woman?
{53643}{53698}What's today? Monday, Tuesday...
{53715}{53803}- Two years.|- Two years. You do remember how?
{53807}{53871}Well, if you start me, it'll all come back.
{53985}{54036}Remember that?
{54039}{54091}Yes. That was just like kissing, right?
{54452}{54524}You're the greatest lover I've ever had.
{54527}{54600}Well, I practise a lot when I'm alone.
{54828}{54930}- Shall we say pistols at dawn?|- We can say it. What does it mean?
{54934}{54987}You have insulted the Countess, honour.
{54990}{55068}- Why? I let her finish first.|- Her seconds will call on you.
{55071}{55180}- Seconds? I never gave her seconds.|- My seconds will call on your seconds.
{55183}{55247}My seconds will be out.|Have 'em call on my thirds.
{55250}{55308}If my thirds are out, go to my fourths.
{55349}{55423}He's serious!|You must meet him on the field of honour.
{55426}{55497}I'm not gonna duel with him.|He's a marksman and a killer.
{55500}{55582}- Your honour is at stake!|- Hey, what is this? Slap Boris Day?
{55585}{55695}You are a war hero. Surely a duel with|Anton Lebedokov is nothing to fear?
{55698}{55760}Look, I just don't wanna|waste a good bullet.
{55764}{55866}The kid's rash. I'll drop by later,|give him a chance to apologise.
{55869}{55920}If he doesn't, I'll move to Finland.
{56148}{56198}Guess who.
{56202}{56255}Oh, I'd know those hands anywhere.
{56258}{56309}It's Old Nehamkin.
{56312}{56367}No. It's...
{56371}{56436}- Boris!|- Yes. How are you?
{56439}{56496}- I brought you a present.|- What?
{56499}{56571}You know those earrings|you always wanted? The long ones?
{56574}{56623}Thank you, cousin Boris.
{56626}{56711}Twice removed. By tomorrow morning,|I may be removed completely.
{56715}{56789}What is it? You look so worried.
{56792}{56864}Sonja, are you scared of dying?
{56871}{56926}Scared is the wrong word.
{56929}{56976}I'm frightened of it.
{56979}{57038}It's an interesting distinction.
{57082}{57148}If only God would give me some sign.
{57152}{57205}If he would just speak to me once.
{57208}{57316}Anything. One sentence. Two words.|If he would just cough.
{57319}{57413}Of course there's a God.|We're made in his image.
{57426}{57512}You think I was made in God's image?|You think he wears glasses?
{57515}{57600}- Not with those frames.|- Nothingness.
{57640}{57689}Non-existence.
{57694}{57757}Black emptiness.
{57760}{57845}- What did you say?|- Oh, I was just planning my future.
{57863}{57918}Why are you so preoccupied with death?
{57921}{57971}Sit down with me for a second.
{57974}{58067}Sonja, tomorrow morning I'm gonna|fight a duel with Anton Lebedokov.
{58070}{58177}He's much better than I am at it|and I'll probably be killed.
{58181}{58268}In case I don't see you again,|I wanted to say that I love you.
{58271}{58332}- Boris!|- I've loved you ever since we were kids.
{58335}{58389}I was heartbroken when you loved Ivan.
{58392}{58440}Why didn't you say something?
{58443}{58513}- Would it have mattered?|- Oh, of course not, darling.
{58516}{58628}If, by some miracle, I'm not killed|tomorrow, would you marry me?
{58660}{58736}What do you think the odds are?
{58739}{58807}To die before the harvest...
{58815}{58915}The crops, the grains.|Fields of rippling wheat.
{58918}{59004}Wheat. All there is in life is wheat.
{59007}{59108}Sonja, here's your chance to do|something kind for a dying boy.
{59111}{59224}But I don't really love Boris. I mean,|I love him, but I'm not in love with him.
{59227}{59309}Oh, wheat! Lots of wheat! Fields of wheat.
{59312}{59367}A tremendous amount of wheat!
{59370}{59444}And yet, he loves me.|And he would make a devoted husband.
{59447}{59557}Not too exciting, but devoted. We'd have|a family. Maybe we could rent one.
{59560}{59640}I could learn to love him.|Me, Boris and six rented children.
{59642}{59732}Or would I feel trapped?|Suffocated? Can't breathe?
{59735}{59828}Open a window!|No, not that one! The one in the bathroom.
{59831}{59932}Yellow wheat. Red wheat.|Wheat with feathers. Cream of wheat.
{59935}{59996}Poor boy, duelling with Anton Lebedokov.
{59999}{60090}By tomorrow, my beloved cousin|Boris will look like a Swiss cheese.
{60093}{60164}Promise him anything,|make him happy for a night.
{60167}{60261}Oh! Or would I feel trapped?|Suffocated? My youth gone?
{60264}{60331}Living with a Swiss cheese|and rented children.
{60334}{60418}Of course I'll marry you, Boris.|It would be an honour for me.
{60540}{60625}This Anton Lebedokov,|he is a good shot, isn't he?
{60628}{60680}- I'm afraid so.|- Well,
{60683}{60746}since this may be|your last night on earth,
{60749}{60802}let's go back to my room and make love.
{60836}{60919}Nice idea. I'll bring the soy sauce.
{61708}{61789}At last. You're late, Grushenko.|We thought you weren't coming.
{61793}{61887}- Well, I overslept.|- Can you be so relaxed and confident?
{61891}{61955}I hate to shoot anybody|before my morning tea.
{61958}{62008}I get a lot of bad mail from the serfs.
{62012}{62073}I implore both of you,|come back to your senses.
{62076}{62172}It can still be called off, by mutual|consent, with no loss of honour.
{62175}{62245}Since you put it that way,|maybe I will hop back into bed.
{62248}{62330}We'll do it now and to the death.
{62333}{62407}Oh, no! I can't do anything to the death.|Doctor's orders.
{62410}{62494}I have an ulcer condition.|Dying is one of the worst things for it.
{62498}{62546}Begin.
{62572}{62642}You have been challenged. Choose.
{62701}{62750}Sure.
{62828}{62898}- All right, I'll take these.|- Just one.
{62912}{62983}Oh, he gets one! That was silly.
{62997}{63145}Starting back to back, on my signal,|you will walk ten paces, turn and fire.
{63162}{63209}- Is that clear?|- Of course.
{63212}{63261}Of course.
{63322}{63396}Good luck. And God be with you both.
{63399}{63448}Are you listening?
{63622}{63676}One, two,
{63679}{63726}three, four,
{63729}{63773}five, six,
{63776}{63822}seven, eight,
{63825}{63871}nine, ten.
{64432}{64498}Does this come out from dry-cleaning?
{64505}{64590}- You must shoot.|- No, no, I don't wanna shoot.
{64593}{64665}You must. It's the law.
{64677}{64765}Well, if it's the law,|then I'll shoot in the air.
{64795}{64854}There. I've fulfilled my obligation.
{65002}{65051}Boris Dimitrovitch.
{65054}{65109}I've learnt a great lesson here today.
{65113}{65195}Me too. Never shoot up in the air|when you're standing under it.
{65198}{65278}You could have killed me. And you didn't.
{65281}{65328}How can I ever repay you?
{65331}{65382}You can start by getting off my toe.
{65385}{65434}Oh, I beg your pardon.
{65450}{65537}Boris Dimitrovitch, from this day on,|I will lead a new life.
{65540}{65589}I will modify my views.
{65592}{65660}I will preach goodness,|perhaps join the church.
{65663}{65724}I will lead a righteous life.
{65727}{65805}Devote myself, as I did in my childhood,|to my singing.
{65906}{65987}He's got a great voice, hasn't he?|I should have shot him.
{65990}{66042}And so, Sonja and I married.
{66045}{66135}I now pronounce you man and wife.
{66182}{66289}I'm so happy. Look at the kid.|She's so happy, she's speechless.
{66292}{66408}He missed. He missed... He missed.
{66628}{66716}I know you're worried whether|you'll be stimulating enough for me.
{66720}{66830}Whether it's possible to live up to|the chores and obligations of married life.
{66833}{66927}It's gonna be a cinch, I promise.|I have no bad habits at all.
{66930}{66984}I grant that I have a few eccentricities.
{66987}{67084}I won't eat any food that begins|with the letter F. Like chicken.
{67088}{67155}Boris, I just don't love you.
{67158}{67250}- Oh, Sonja.|- I love you. But I'm not in love with you.
{67253}{67311}Sonja, do you even know|what love means?
{67314}{67378}There are many|different kinds of love, Boris.
{67381}{67440}There's love between|a man and a woman.
{67443}{67492}Love between a mother and a son.
{67495}{67548}Two women. Let's not forget my favourite.
{67551}{67670}- And the love I've always dreamed of.|- Yeah?
{67674}{67739}The love between|two extraordinary individuals.
{67742}{67834}- Sonja.|- Oh, don't, Boris. Please.
{67845}{67909}Sex without love is an empty experience.
{67929}{68023}Yes, but as empty experiences go,|it's one of the best.
{68126}{68200}At first, things were|a little tense between us.
{68222}{68281}But aftera while, she relaxed.
{68451}{68500}Don't. Not here.
{68572}{68633}Soon, Sonja got more used to me.
{68636}{68697}Sometimes, she actually had fun.
{68700}{68765}Like the time she baked her first souffl.
{68953}{69050}Money was scarce, and Sonja learned|to make wonderful dishes out ofsnow.
{69053}{69148}- Sweetheart, it looks a little rare to me.|- I baked it for an hour and a half.
{69151}{69215}Did you? Cos it looks...|What's for dessert?
{69218}{69265}- A surprise, Boris.|- Yes? What?
{69268}{69383}- A nice big bowl of sleet!|- Oh, sleet! My favourite! That's wonderful.
{69407}{69463}Evenings, we played music together.
{69466}{69530}And as time passed, I won herheart.
{69541}{69623}Oh, Boris. I've never been so happy|in my entire life.
{69627}{69722}I love you, Boris, in a deeper way|than I ever thought was possible.
{69725}{69767}Really?
{69798}{69847}I wanna have children with you.
{69851}{69899}- What kind?|- Little children.
{69902}{69977}Of course.|The big ones are mentally slower.
{69980}{70040}- I wanna have three children.|- One of each.
{70044}{70101}Oh, Boris.
{70106}{70148}I'm actually happy.
{70155}{70217}Well, I hate to say I told you so, but
{70220}{70277}some men have it and some men don't.
{70287}{70344}Fortunately, I have so much of it.
{70377}{70456}Those next months|were the happiest time ofmy life.
{70664}{70737}Then one day, at the height|ofmy sense ofwellbeing,
{70740}{70795}I suddenly,|and for no apparent reason,
{70798}{70868}was seized with an urge|to commit suicide.
{70872}{70959}You're healthy, you have a beautiful wife,|your work is going well.
{70962}{71009}I know, but something's missing.
{71012}{71082}- What?|- I feel a void at the centre of my being.
{71085}{71163}- What kind of void?|- Well, an empty void.
{71165}{71189}An empty void?
{71193}{71268}I felt the full void a month ago,|but it was something I ate.
{71276}{71343}Maybe what you have|is a sickness of the soul.
{71370}{71427}- Look, there's Death.|- What? Who?
{71437}{71498}Death!|He's got Krapotkin, the wine merchant.
{71501}{71552}- Really?|- Yeah, and a woman.
{71555}{71634}- Ooh, it's not Mrs Krapotkin.|- You're kidding.
{71637}{71714}No. I always knew Krapotkin|was diddling somebody else.
{71727}{71824}- Where are you taking Krapotkin?|- Away! For ever!
{71828}{71906}Listen, if you run into my wife,|tell her I'm with you!
{71909}{72000}Goodbye, Krapotkin.|If you get a chance, write.
{72074}{72183}Father Andre,|holiest of holies, aged and wise,
{72186}{72259}you are the most wrinkled man|in the entire country.
{72262}{72342}Get off my beard, you little jerk.
{72391}{72463}Rise, my child. Rise.
{72466}{72589}- I'm standing.|- My eyesight is poor.
{72610}{72710}Everyone says you're senile with age,|but you're the only one that can help me.
{72713}{72767}I don't think you're senile.
{72770}{72833}Where did you say the fish was caught?
{72836}{72935}- What fish?|- Didn't you say something about fish?
{72938}{73018}Father, Boris is trying to commit suicide.
{73030}{73135}Last week he contemplated killing|himself by inhaling next to an Armenian.
{73138}{73203}Tell Boris this.
{73216}{73292}I have lived many years
{73295}{73440}and, after many trials and tribulations,
{73443}{73577}I have come to the conclusion|that the best thing is...
{73580}{73609}Yes?
{73612}{73705}...blonde, 12-year-old girls.
{73709}{73734}Father!
{73737}{73807}Two of them, whenever possible.
{73810}{73863}Father, I counted on you.
{73881}{73976}I forgive you. I forgive you.
{73979}{74050}Thank you, Your Grubbiness.
{74118}{74166}As I dangled at the rope's end,
{74170}{74233}I was suddenly seized|with an urge to live.
{74236}{74284}All I could think ofwas Sonja.
{74287}{74369}I wanted to hold her close to me,|weep tears on hershoulder,
{74372}{74419}and engage in oral sex.
{74422}{74481}It was then that I made|the decision to live,
{74484}{74534}to live and become a greatpoet.
{74549}{74611}I should have been
{74614}{74734}a pair of ragged claws
{74737}{74886}scuttling across the floors
{74895}{74973}of silent seas.
{75018}{75074}Too sentimental.
{75113}{75185}That winter|Sonja and I had a wonderful time.
{75188}{75264}We found a new friend,|Berdykov, the village idiot.
{75267}{75370}Berdykov would sit smiling for days|and stroke a little piece ofvelvet.
{75373}{75438}Sonja would make him happy|by feeding him cookies.
{75442}{75529}We looked forward to the spring,|when we could have a child ofour own.
{75532}{75570}Little did we know...
{75582}{75698}War! Napoleon|has invaded Russia! It's war!
{75797}{75880}Oh, what about all our plans?|We were gonna be parents this year!
{75883}{75971}There's gonna be a slight change.|Instead, we're gonna be refugees.
{75974}{76066}- That's terrible!|- We have to take everything and flee.
{76069}{76168}I'm very good at that. I was the men's|freestyle fleeing champion for two years.
{76172}{76279}We have to burn the food so the French|don't get it. But it's tough to light borscht.
{76282}{76337}- Boris, I have an idea.|- What?
{76366}{76420}Let's assassinate Napoleon.
{76434}{76508}Yeah. Interesting.|Do you want to start knitting dinner?
{76512}{76570}- I'm serious.|- What do you mean?
{76573}{76632}I mean, Iet's you and I kill Napoleon.
{76636}{76714}You been drinking from|the glass we use for the village idiot?
{76717}{76804}- It's the answer to our problems.|- It's not the answer. It's an answer.
{76808}{76919}And it's the wrong answer.|The correct answer is flee. F-L-E-A. Flee.
{76922}{77008}- The French occupy Moscow. He's there.|- Sonja!
{77011}{77095}Two innocent-looking types like us|could get in and shoot him.
{77098}{77160}We'd never get near him,|and if we did, we'd miss.
{77163}{77212}He's a tough target. He's very small.
{77215}{77281}Boris, it's our chance|to perform a truly heroic act.
{77284}{77339}Since when is murder a heroic act?
{77342}{77427}Violence is justified|in the service of mankind.
{77430}{77487}- Who said that?|- Attila the Hun.
{77496}{77544}You're quoting a Hun to me?
{77547}{77601}Don't you know|that murder carries with it
{77604}{77720}a moral imperative that transcends|any notion of inherent universal free will?
{77762}{77831}That is incredibly jejune.
{77867}{77919}- That's jejune?|- Jejune!
{77922}{78023}You have the temerity to say that|I'm talking to you out ofjejunosity?
{78026}{78102}I am one of the most june people|in all of the Russias.
{78105}{78148}I have Ivan's old pistol.
{78152}{78220}Sonja!|Political assassination doesn't work.
{78224}{78317}Violence leads to violence. He who|lives by the sword dies by the sword.
{78321}{78367}Well, I'm out of clichs now.
{78371}{78472}- Are you suggesting passive resistance?|- No, I'm suggesting active fleeing.
{78475}{78561}- You can't run away all your life.|- I know, but murder.
{78565}{78614}The most foul of all crimes.
{78617}{78716}And not abstract murder like shooting|an unknown enemy on the battlefield,
{78719}{78794}but standing in a closed room|with a live human being
{78797}{78853}and pulling the trigger, face to face.
{78856}{78956}And a famous human being, a successful|one, one who earns more than I do.
{78959}{79066}My God, you figure Napoleon has gotta|be good for 10,000 francs a week.
{79069}{79168}That's minimum. That's without tips|or extras. Nothing like that.
{79171}{79245}And me, what am I? He's a great man.
{79249}{79343}He thinks like the superman|and I'm just a worm,
{79347}{79489}an insect, some kind of crawling,|disgusting, creeping little vermin.
{79512}{79602}- You know, you can stop me.|- I will when I disagree.
{79605}{79658}Sonja. Who are we to kill somebody?
{79661}{79755}Boris, for the first time in my life|I feel free. Weightless.
{79759}{79846}I have an exhilarating feeling|of human freedom.
{79849}{79893}It's called the guillotine.
{79896}{79932}Oh, Iook, Boris.
{79935}{80022}The soft golden dusk is|already transmogrifying itself
{80025}{80085}into the blue star-sprinkled night.
{80121}{80184}Careful, cos that gun may be loaded.
{80187}{80252}Several days later|we set out forMoscow.
{80255}{80339}We took Berdykov with us partway.|He was on his way to Minsk.
{80342}{80447}There was a village idiots' convention in|Minsk. Berdykov was planning to attend.
{80450}{80531}Village idiots from all overRussia|were meeting there.
{80758}{80832}We drove through|small villages and tiny hamlets.
{80835}{80956}We had no greatplan, but when we|stopped at an inn, fate provided one.
{81214}{81321}Pardon me. Could you tell me|who those people are behind that screen?
{81324}{81408}That's Don Francisco of Spain|and his sister.
{81411}{81477}They're en route to meet Napoleon.
{81737}{81831}- Don Francisco, I presume.|- Do you know me, senor?
{81834}{81904}Oh, Iet's just say|your name is legend in these parts.
{81922}{81983}- It is?|- Well, perhaps not legend,
{81986}{82052}but it never fails to get a big laugh.
{82054}{82175}And you must be the Don's sister,|the noted Spanish countess and mieskeit.
{82179}{82227}Who are you?
{82230}{82317}Just a humble servant|who wishes to buy His Excellency a drink.
{82320}{82366}I would be honoured.
{82375}{82486}Waiter, a bottle of your best red wine,|please, and two straws.
{82489}{82541}Two straws.
{82545}{82612}Word has it|the Don is en route to visit Napoleon.
{82648}{82704}Word travels fast.
{82718}{82790}Not as fast as good news.
{82803}{82872}No news is good news.
{82879}{82964}Here today, gone tomorrow.
{82984}{83076}You can lead a horse to water,|but you can't make him drink.
{83080}{83141}- Your turn.|- We would invite you to join us,
{83144}{83250}but the difference in social rank and|wealth, it makes it silly.
{83261}{83340}Oh, yes, I threw this on.|It's a knockdown.
{83367}{83423}You guys know Napoleon, or what?
{83440}{83494}Hardly.
{83545}{83590}A joke, Your Nothingness?
{83592}{83681}We're friends with his brother,|who arranges the affairs of Spain,
{83684}{83771}but this is our first meeting|with the great emperor.
{83838}{83880}It's all I wanted to know.
{83951}{84022}- Don Francisco?|- Pardon me?
{84025}{84094}I'm having trouble adjusting my belt.
{84109}{84187}You think you could come over here|and hold my bosom for awhile?
{84227}{84280}Of course, senorita.
{85301}{85382}No, no, no, it's not what I had in mind.
{85397}{85485}It should have more cream|between the crust and no raisins.
{85488}{85566}- But at our last meeting you said raisins.|- No!
{85584}{85701}If this pastry is to bear my name,|it must be richer! More cream.
{85704}{85764}- Yes, but is there time?|- Very little.
{85768}{85840}My spies tell me|that my illustrious British enemy
{85843}{85965}is working on a new meat recipe|which he plans to call Beef Wellington.
{85968}{86026}It will never get off the ground.
{86029}{86125}We must develop the Napoleon|before he develops Beef Wellington.
{86164}{86239}The future of Europe|hangs in the balance.
{86242}{86291}Yes, Your Highness.
{86312}{86361}We must see you, Your Highness.
{86390}{86457}We believe there is a plot|to take your life.
{86460}{86488}Vraiment?
{86491}{86627}So we,ve made up an obscure private|from the ranks to look like you. Look.
{86630}{86680}How do you do, Your Highness?
{86701}{86796}- He looks like me?|- You're seeing him without his rug.
{86963}{87057}- Come.|- Just let me get this on, Your Highness.
{87081}{87169}And now I take your place.
{87186}{87293}I will teach you to walk like me.|I have a great walk.
{87340}{87449}With the emperor out of the way,|all that remains is to kill Don Francisco.
{87471}{87585}That will destroy His Highness,|stupid dreams of a treaty with Spain.
{87614}{87685}Then I'll sail to Austria,
{87701}{87840}and form an alliance with the crown.|Not the king, just the crown.
{87867}{87912}They call me mad,
{87916}{87997}but one day,|when the history of France is written,
{88000}{88054}they will mark my name well.
{88081}{88130}Sidney Applebaum.
{88456}{88505}We're here to see the emperor.
{88522}{88572}Who is calling?
{88700}{88768}- Who? Oh, that's droll!|- Droll, yes.
{88772}{88870}He's not familiar with the list of|the hundred most important Spanishers.
{88873}{88938}Yes.|It is only Don Francisco and his sister.
{88942}{88991}Yes, the Donessa.
{88994}{89043}We have an appointment with Napoleon.
{89046}{89119}Napoleon Bonaparte.|The noted international tyrant.
{89122}{89205}- You are Don Francisco and his sister?|- Oh, for sure.
{89209}{89292}- We have had a long... a hot journey.|- A hot journey.
{89295}{89354}- Our throats are parched.|- They're parched.
{89358}{89420}- We seek succour. Succour.|- Succour!
{89423}{89499}Yes. Is Succour here by any chance?
{89502}{89579}I never knew your name, madam.
{89582}{89665}The boys usually just call me Juanita.
{89797}{89865}The emperor appreciates|magnificent women.
{89869}{89939}- He'll be much taken with you.|- Oh, good! I wore my flats.
{89943}{90028}We are, of course, all most anxious|to hear your proposal for a treaty.
{90031}{90145}Good. I've given it a lot of thought|and I've come up with all the little details.
{90148}{90224}If I can just think of the main points,|we got something!
{90227}{90294}Let's leave business,|you've had a wearing journey.
{90297}{90406}- We should say hello to the emperor.|- Shorts gets touchy if we bypass him.
{90409}{90549}Later. First, you'll be wined and dined|in a manner befitting Spanish nobility.
{90553}{90639}Oh, wonderful! But go easy on|the champagne. The Donessa has gout.
{90642}{90718}Well, if you'll proceed,|your needs will be attended to.
{90721}{90769}Thank you.
{90790}{90891}While you're here with your sister,|should you desire a French love dream
{90895}{90958}to be sent to your room,|it will be arranged.
{90961}{91055}Good. Maybe I'll have two|to keep the symmetry perfect.
{91058}{91172}- I prefer two myself.|- I prefer three, but it's hard to get one.
{91418}{91485}Is this room big enough,|or would you prefer a suite?
{91488}{91570}- Boris, I'm scared.|- You? I'm growing a beak and feathers.
{91574}{91638}- What are we gonna do?|- I say we get outta here now.
{91641}{91719}I'm not leaving here|until we shoot Napoleon. Here.
{91722}{91774}Oh, I see. Thanks. I'm the hit man.
{91777}{91852}Remember, you can't take any chances.
{91855}{91987}Now, make sure the barrel of the gun|is pressed against his head or his chest.
{91990}{92077}And don't pull the trigger, Boris.|Squeeze it.
{92097}{92167}Where did you go to finishing school?|On a pirate ship?
{92170}{92228}Let's just make sure|our plans are straight.
{92231}{92315}OK. You flirt with him,|bring him back here after dinner,
{92318}{92392}lull him into a state of satisfaction|and I'll shoot him.
{92395}{92477}"I'll shoot him".|Can you believe I'm talking like this?
{92543}{92623}Yes. Spain is quite warm this time of year.
{92625}{92678}Barcelona is warmer than Madrid,
{92681}{92795}but, then, the people are so different,|the Barcelonians and the Madridniks.
{92809}{92897}Are all the ladies in Spain|as beautiful as you are, madam?
{92900}{92964}Well, not all. You gotta have some beasts.
{92990}{93019}Oh, General.
{93022}{93081}Do excuse me, madam.
{93097}{93156}Take it easy.|You're making a fool of yourself.
{93159}{93246}- Hey, this is good champagne.|- Are you gonna drink another case?
{93249}{93298}I'll be fine, all I need is a few solids.
{93301}{93352}A few solids? You should drink a blotter.
{93356}{93442}Oh, I believe I had the pleasure|of meeting your sister once.
{93445}{93531}- My sister? Which one?|- I thought you only had one.
{93534}{93578}One? Oh, no, no.
{93582}{93651}Actually, well, I have a half-sister.
{93655}{93743}Well, no, not exactly half. It's two-fifths.
{93747}{93786}Ladies and gentlemen,
{93789}{93877}His Imperial Highness,|the Emperor Napoleon.
{94128}{94219}- So you are Don Francisco?|- Yes. I have regards from your brother.
{94222}{94304}Says you went away, you don't write.|He never hears from you.
{94307}{94358}You took his razor,|you never returned it.
{94362}{94425}- This is an honour for me.|- It's a greater honour for me.
{94428}{94496}- No, a greater honour for me.|- No, a greater honour for me.
{94499}{94586}- No, a greater honour for me.|- Well, perhaps it is a greater for you.
{94589}{94679}- You must be Don Francisco's sister.|- You must be Don Francisco's sister.
{94682}{94781}- No, you must be Don Francisco's sister.|- No, you must be Don Francisco's sister.
{94784}{94879}- No, it's a greater honour for me.|- Our guests have a sense of humour.
{94882}{94943}- She's a great kidder.|- No, you're a great kidder.
{94947}{94992}No, you're Don Francisco's sister.
{94996}{95053}- Shall we dine?|- Oh, can we eat first?
{95294}{95399}Your sister and His Highness|seem to be getting along quite well.
{95402}{95453}Do you find me attractive as a man?
{95456}{95506}Yes. I think that's your best bet.
{95522}{95610}How much of your feelings for me|are because I rule half of Europe?
{95613}{95665}Oh, I'd say half my feelings. It evens out.
{95668}{95739}Will you be more difficult|to conquer than Russia?
{95742}{95785}Well, I weigh less.
{95788}{95870}- I'll go to your room after dinner.|- Good. I'll go to yours.
{96058}{96107}Come in.
{96146}{96238}Sonja, I've been thinking|about this. It's murder.
{96242}{96311}If everybody did this,|it'd be a world full of murderers.
{96315}{96377}- What would that do to property values?|- I know.
{96380}{96448}If everybody went to|the same restaurant one evening
{96451}{96516}to eat blintzes, there'd be chaos.|But they don't.
{96519}{96580}I tell her murder. She tells me blintzes.
{96584}{96645}Hey, you said yourself|there is no right or wrong.
{96648}{96703}- It's what you choose.|- That's right,
{96707}{96755}and I choose danger.
{96758}{96838}- Oh, really?|- No, but it sounded great tonight.
{96859}{96946}Oh, Boris.|If only we could be children again.
{96950}{97010}Yeah, I know. Preferably French children.
{97013}{97114}Do you know the only truly happy person|I know is Berdykov, the village idiot?
{97118}{97176}It's easier to be happy|if your only concern
{97179}{97236}is figuring out how much saliva to dribble.
{97240}{97295}- Kiss me.|- Which one do you want?
{97298}{97400}- Give me a number eight.|- That's two fours. That's an easy one.
{97493}{97542}Coming!
{97886}{97927}- Are you alone?|- Of course.
{97930}{97984}- I thought I heard voices.|- I was praying.
{97987}{98054}- I heard two voices.|- Oh, well, I do both parts.
{98057}{98151}Champagne! From France.
{98166}{98214}I see you brought the whole kit.
{98587}{98651}- To your eyes.|- To the bridge of your nose.
{98726}{98775}My lust knows no bounds.
{98778}{98826}Shall we... to the bed?
{98830}{98881}Shall we what to the bed?
{98884}{98933}Forgive my haste.
{98936}{99051}We have always heard|that Spanish blood is the hottest.
{99054}{99125}- I had mine cooled for the summer.|- You may set the pace.
{99128}{99219}Good. Why don't we just|sit awhile and build slowly?
{99222}{99304}You don't want to peak too early.|You'll be gone before midnight.
{99307}{99392}- You are a temptress.|- Oh, please, Excellency.
{99395}{99481}- Call me Napoleon.|- Good. You can call me Napoleon, too.
{99485}{99530}I've never met a woman like you.
{99534}{99618}I could rest my head on your shoulder|like this for ever.
{99645}{99723}Yes, it sounds like it'd be fun,|except for the grease mark.
{99726}{99775}His Excellency.
{99956}{100005}- What's that?|- Oh, just a breeze.
{100008}{100076}A breeze with mice.|Mice, what's the difference?
{100079}{100154}If I had a woman like you|instead of my wife,
{100157}{100206}I would conquer all of Europe.
{100249}{100298}- What's that?|- What? Oh, that.
{100301}{100363}I think that was the old closet door|slamming shut.
{100367}{100454}One can't be too careful. The Russian|underground would love me dead.
{100457}{100525}I take a great chance|in an occupied territory.
{100528}{100579}Assassins surround me.
{100582}{100670}Every day|is another encounter with death.
{100673}{100774}Yes, well... This is the price|one pays for political power.
{100777}{100831}Yes, Iife at the top is hell.
{100834}{100894}Which is why|I relish every minute with you.
{100897}{100951}Every second means something to me.
{100969}{101018}That's why the sooner...
{101021}{101117}The sooner we consummate|the act of love, the happier I will be.
{101155}{101203}- Go ahead.|- I can't.
{101206}{101258}- Don Francisco.|- Shoot!
{101261}{101316}Put down that pistol. She's over 18.
{101320}{101381}You're a tyrant and a dictator|and you start wars.
{101384}{101439}- Why is he reciting my credits?|- Kill him!
{101443}{101492}- Guards!|- No.
{101631}{101685}Boris, we're not here on a vacation.
{101688}{101770}I can't shoot him. He's a human being.|He'll bleed on the carpet.
{101773}{101821}Give me that gun.
{101848}{101900}See? It's not so easy.
{101917}{101966}Why? Why can't I do it?
{101969}{102018}Because it's morally wrong.
{102021}{102112}- I see. Can you define your terms?|- There's a moral imperative here.
{102115}{102199}- Where?|- By killing Napoleon, you kill yourself,
{102202}{102277}because we're involved|in a kind of a total absolute.
{102280}{102348}Come on. We're not.|You're being pantheistic again.
{102351}{102471}How is that pantheistic? We all|relate universally to a giant oneness.
{102489}{102575}You wanna hit him? He's coming to again.|Just give him a little shot.
{102578}{102629}We're dealing with an ethical question.
{102632}{102692}You're not gonna quote|Thomas Aquinas again?
{102695}{102810}Absolutely. He said "Never kill a man"|particularly if it means taking his life".
{102898}{102922}What?
{102925}{103012}If we don't stop him,|he'll burn down half of Europe.
{103015}{103078}Maybe it'll be|the half with our landlord in it.
{103081}{103138}- Boris. For our children.|- We don't have any.
{103141}{103197}- For our parents.|- They don't have children.
{103201}{103248}- Well, I'm gonna kill him.|- Sonja.
{103251}{103298}- I am.|- No. All right. Look,
{103301}{103377}pull the carriage out front. I'll go kill him.
{103566}{103661}Look at him. If I don't kill him,|he'll make war all through Europe.
{103687}{103734}But murder?
{103738}{103801}What would Socrates say?
{103804}{103859}All those Greeks were homosexuals.
{103873}{103936}Boy, they must have had|some wild parties.
{103939}{104023}I bet they all took a house together|on Crete for the summer.
{104027}{104085}(a) Socrates is a man.
{104088}{104148}(b) All men are mortal.
{104152}{104210}(c) All men are Socrates.
{104227}{104282}That means all men are homosexuals.
{104305}{104354}I'm not a homosexual.
{104357}{104431}Once, some Cossacks whistled at me.
{104446}{104553}I happen to have the kind of body|that excites both persuasions.
{104556}{104626}But, you know,|some men are heterosexual,
{104629}{104750}and some men are bisexual,|and some men don't think about sex at all.
{104753}{104802}They become lawyers.
{104819}{104896}My problem is that|I see both sides of every issue.
{104899}{105010}I'm too logical.|You know, the world is not logical.
{105013}{105108}If it was logical, how would Old Nehamkin|be younger than Young Nehamkin?
{105111}{105189}I knew there was something crazy|about that when I was a kid,
{105192}{105281}but every time I said something,|they'd smack me. So, you know,
{105284}{105416}I'm just racked with guilt|and I'm consumed with remorse
{105418}{105496}and stricken with suffering|for the human race.
{105499}{105553}And not only that, but I'm developing
{105556}{105632}a herpes on my lip here|that is really killing me.
{105689}{105738}What to do?
{106081}{106171}Arrest this man for murder.|Fortunately, he only killed an impostor.
{106175}{106241}I didn't do anything.|Hey, take it easy, will you?
{106244}{106295}You're bending my throat.
{106299}{106356}The Spanish government|will hear about this.
{106359}{106442}Don Francisco is not a man|who takes these things lightly.
{106446}{106493}There's Don Francisco now.
{106497}{106566}There's been a mistake. I know - I made it.
{106576}{106660}By some miracle, Sonja managed|to elude the French and escape.
{106664}{106761}l, with my usual good luck, got thrown|in a damp cell to await execution -
{106765}{106806}my favourite pastime.
{106809}{106889}Fortunately, it was a Frenchjail,|so the food was not bad.
{106937}{106980}My family was allowed to visit me.
{106988}{107061}Remember that nice boy next door?|Raskolnikov?
{107064}{107121}- Yeah?|- He killed two ladies.
{107125}{107180}No! What a nasty story.
{107183}{107282}Bobick told it to me. He heard it|from one of the Karamazov brothers.
{107294}{107368}- He must have been possessed.|- Well, he was a raw youth.
{107371}{107472}- Raw youth? He was an idiot.|- And he acted insulted and injured.
{107480}{107564}- I hear he was a gambler.|- You know, he could be your double.
{107581}{107633}Really? How novel.
{107636}{107685}Son,
{107694}{107795}for long years|I have saved this piece of land for you.
{107798}{107880}- Look, it has a house on it.|- Yes, it's a nice little house.
{107883}{107937}You haven't wasted your life, I see.
{107943}{108011}Don't let any strangers come on it.
{108014}{108063}No, no strangers.
{108066}{108131}You're a major loon, you know that?
{108161}{108274}Next year I'll expect|to build a guest house.
{108278}{108370}Oh, a little tiny guest house|with a handball court
{108373}{108455}and a little, Iittle swimming pool|for fleas or something?
{108458}{108563}Yes, well, you'll want to get|some rest in your rubber bedroom now.
{109048}{109151}- Who are you?|- I am an angel ofGod.
{109174}{109262}- You're kidding.|- Fearnot, Boris.
{109265}{109319}You have led ajust life,
{109322}{109408}and at the last minute,|before the execution,
{109411}{109480}the emperorplans to pardon you.
{109493}{109529}Really?
{109532}{109612}He will make a greatpersonal show|ofhis generosity,
{109628}{109700}and you will have learned yourlesson,
{109703}{109802}but you will not be executed.
{109844}{109893}Then there is a God.
{109896}{109945}Incredible.
{109948}{109998}Moses was right.
{110001}{110086}He that abideth in truth
{110089}{110238}and will have frankincense and myrrh|smeared on his gums in abundance,
{110242}{110312}and he shall dwell|in the house of the Lord
{110315}{110392}for six months with an option to buy.
{110402}{110525}But the wicked man|shall have all kinds of problems.
{110528}{110598}His tongue shall cleave|to the roof of his upper palate.
{110601}{110683}And he shall speak like a woman,|if you watch him closely
{110686}{110735}And he shall...
{110739}{110823}The wicked man shall be|delivered into the hands of his enemy,
{110826}{110889}whether they can|pay the delivery charge or not.
{110892}{110941}And... Wait, I have more
{110944}{110972}about the wicked man.
{110975}{111062}I shall walk through|the valley of the shadow of death...
{111088}{111137}In fact, now that I think of it,
{111140}{111214}I shall run through|the valley of the shadow of death,
{111217}{111276}cos you get out of the valley|quicker that way.
{111280}{111419}And he that hath clean hands|and a pure heart is OK in my book.
{111422}{111539}But he that fools around with
{111542}{111614}barnyard animals has got to be watched.
{111617}{111659}I thank you.
{111766}{111820}All right, Grushenko, come on. Let's go.
{111831}{111902}You guys are late.|I've been waitin, here since 6.30.
{111905}{111969}- You're awfully cheerful.|- You know how it is
{111972}{112028}when you're extra brave. Probably not.
{112239}{112318}Busy day, huh?|Are you guys having a sale?
{112334}{112431}No blindfold. That's forlosers.|I like to see where the bullet hits.
{112434}{112530}I learned that during the war.|I was decorated, you know.
{112543}{112594}Wonder what the emperor's doing today?
{112627}{112688}- Ready.|- You wanna move closer? Don't miss.
{112692}{112736}Looks bad on the report.
{112739}{112778}Aim.
{112781}{112838}Boy, the emperor's really cutting it close.
{112842}{112920}What a flair for the dramatic...|that old slyboots.
{112956}{112977}Fire.
{113013}{113103}It's a very complicated situation,|cousin Sonja.
{113111}{113195}I'm in love with Alexei. He loves Alicia.
{113198}{113272}Alicia's having an affair with Lev.
{113298}{113347}Lev loves Tatiana.
{113350}{113409}Tatiana loves Simkin.
{113412}{113471}Simkin loves me.
{113490}{113578}I love Simkin,|but in a different way than Alexei.
{113602}{113681}Alexei loves Tatiana like a sister.
{113684}{113791}Tatiana's sister loves Trigorian|like a brother.
{113794}{113886}Trigorian's brother|is having an affair with my sister,
{113890}{113974}who he likes physically,|but not spiritually.
{113977}{114043}Natasha, it's getting a little late.
{114046}{114096}The firm of Mishkin and Mishkin
{114099}{114183}is sleeping with|the firm of Taskov and Taskov.
{114193}{114265}Natasha, to love is to suffer.
{114268}{114335}To avoid suffering, one must not love.
{114338}{114392}But then one suffers from not loving.
{114395}{114449}Therefore, to love is to suffer.
{114452}{114539}Not to love is to suffer.|To suffer is to suffer.
{114542}{114604}To be happy is to love.
{114607}{114707}To be happy, then, is to suffer,|but suffering makes one unhappy.
{114710}{114787}Therefore, to be unhappy one must love,
{114790}{114864}or love to suffer,|or suffer from too much happiness...
{114867}{114936}I hope you're getting this down.
{114951}{115013}I never want to marry.
{115044}{115108}I just want to get divorced.
{115118}{115195}Oh, Iook. It's Boris.
{115288}{115357}Boris, what happened?
{115360}{115419}- I got screwed.|- How?
{115422}{115525}I don't know. Some vision said I was|going to get pardoned, and they shot me.
{115529}{115594}You were my one great love.
{115599}{115699}Thank you very much. I appreciate that.|Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm dead.
{115707}{115767}- What's it like?|- What's it like?
{115770}{115835}You know the chicken|at Tresky's restaurant?
{115838}{115887}- Yeah.|- It's worse.
{116026}{116081}Worse than the chicken at Tresky's.
{116100}{116167}Oh, well, life must go on.
{116187}{116241}The last traces of the shimmering dusk
{116244}{116332}are setting|behind the quickly darkening evening,
{116336}{116391}and it's only noon.
{116412}{116485}Soon we shall be covered by wheat.
{116519}{116566}Did you say
{116569}{116607}wheat?
{116610}{116670}Wheat.
{116687}{116761}Wheat.|I'm dead, they're talking about wheat.
{116783}{116863}The question is,|have I learned anything about life?
{116867}{116969}Only that human beings|are divided into mind and body.
{116972}{117092}The mind embraces all the nobler|aspirations, like poetry and philosophy,
{117095}{117150}but the body has all the fun.
{117181}{117265}The important thing, I think,|is not to be bitter.
{117268}{117364}You know, if it turns out that there|is a God, I don't think that he's evil.
{117367}{117483}I think the worst you can say about him|is that basically he's an underachiever.
{117486}{117576}After all, you know,|there are worse things in life than death.
{117580}{117662}If you've ever spent an evening|with an insurance salesman,
{117665}{117716}you know exactly what I mean.
{117719}{117808}The key here, I think,|is to not think of death as an end,
{117811}{117939}but think of it more as a very effective|way of cutting down on your expenses.
{117962}{118048}Regarding love...|You know, what can you say?
{118051}{118153}It's not the quantity|of your sexual relations that count.
{118156}{118200}It's the quality.
{118203}{118306}On the other hand, if the quantity|drops below once every eight months,
{118309}{118363}I would definitely look into it.
{118382}{118452}Well, that's about it for me, folks.
{118455}{118496}Goodbye.
