You miss me today or what, huh?

Huh?

Here you go. Say hi. If you could sing or
dance, I wouldn't be doin' this, you know?

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,952
And this turtle food I got here, it's uh...

68
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,949
This turtle food, gotta add more flies in.
There are more moths in it.

69
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,516
More flies... More moths...
Who the hell cares?

70
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,154
How you feelin' this mornin'? Full of life?

71

- Fine.

- Me, I'm kinda aggravated, you know?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

How you doin', Gloria?

76
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,435
The last turtle food I got here
had more moths in it than flies.

77
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,075
The moths get caught
in the turtles' throats.

78
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,398
They cough and I smack 'em on the back
of the shell. What do you think they get?

79
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,080
And they get what, huh?

80
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,874
Come on... Shell-shocked.
They get shell-shocked.

81
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,516
- Startin' with the bad jokes early, huh?
- Inventin' jokes ain't so easy sometimes.

82

- That wasn't a joke.
<i>- (barking)</i>

clean all the cat cages. They're a mess.

turtle food, Rock-head.

88
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,153
Hey, crime don't pay.
You know that, Gloria. You know that.

89
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,990

Hey! Hey!

95
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,796
- Don't hit the face!
- Shut up! Mr Gazzo wants the 200 now.

96
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,875
I'm broke!

97
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,037
Mr Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb.

98
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,596
- Please! Please! Don't break my...
- What's your name again?

- Listen, Bob...

100
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,034
You wanna dance,
you gotta pay the band.

101
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,310
You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

102
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,070
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob,
you understand? Gimme some money.

103
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,475
Gimme some money. Come on.

104
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,030
- There's 130 here.
- That's it. I'm broke.

105
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,957
Hey, Bob. Hey, hey.

106
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,036
You're still $70 light.

107
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,075
You don't have to break nothin'. Here,
take my coat. It's worth 50, 60 dollars.

108
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,919
Here, take the coat. Take the coat!

109
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,918
- Be smart.
- You shoulda planned ahead, you know?

110
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,600
- You shoulda planned ahead.
- I'll tape up the hand!

111
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,871
- You shoulda planned ahead.
- Gazzo won't have to know!

112
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,675
He won't be wise to nothin'.
Gazzo won't be wise to nothin'!

113
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,676
He won't...

114
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,228
He only had 130, but I think he's
good for the rest next week, Mr Gazzo.

115
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,715
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

116
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,999
That's it for today.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.

117
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,477
- He's late three weeks and I don't like it.
- Tomorrow, three weeks, Del Rio.

118
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,716
I got it. How do you spell Del Rio?

119
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,876
- How'd you do last night?
- Real good.

120
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,913
- Hey, did you get the licence number?
- Of what?

121
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,999
- The truck that run over your face.
- Relax, buddy. Pull it over here.

122
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,032
I wanna let Rocky out,
then I'm gonna talk to him.

123
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,196
How come you didn't break his thumb?

124
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,515
- How do you know I didn't?
- I hear things.

125
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,949
- Did I give you a job this mornin'?
- Yeah.

126
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,116
So why didn't you break his thumb?

127
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,915
When you don't do what I tell you to do,
you make me look bad, Rock.

128
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,670
I figured... Look, if I break the guy's
thumb, he gets laid off, right? He can't...

129
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,351
Well, let me do the figurin', OK, Rock?
From here on, just let me do the figurin'.

130
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,359
These guys think we're runnin'
a charity and they're gonna get off light.

131
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,835
From here on in,
do what I tell you to do...

132
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,317
...because it's bad for my reputation,
you understand? You got it, Rock?

133
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,196
I got it.

134
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,310
Hey, how do you spell Del Rio?

135
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,749
- Look in a dictionary, Rock!
- Come on!

136
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,509
Hey, I won't let that happen no more -
about the thumb.

137
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,035
You know?

138
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,390
So long, meatbag.

139
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,000
I shoulda broke <i>your</i> thumbs!

140
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,669
- I heard you did real good last night.
- Absolutely. You shoulda seen me.

141
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,268
- You oughta take a rest.
- No, my back is hurtin'.

142
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,994
- Your back?
- My back is hurtin'. You deaf?

143
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,917
No, I'm short.

144
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,712
Hey, yo, Mike. Where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

145
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,877
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

146
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,518
What you talkin' about? It's been my
locker for six years. Where's my gear?

147
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,393
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.

148
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,595
You put my stuff on skid row?

149
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,395
I been in that locker for six years
and you put my stuff on skid row?

150
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,954
Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it.

151
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,993
- Where is he?
- He's outside, working with Dipper.

152
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,680
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

153
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,637
Put your hands up there. That's right.
Keep your hands up. That's right.

154
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,274
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

155
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,356
<i>(trainer)</i> Attaboy!

156
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,196

- What the hell...? What do you want?
- How you feelin' today?

158
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,989
- What are you, a doctor or somethin'?
- You got problems today?

159
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,908
- Never mind my problem. What's yours?
- I've been talkin' to Michael.

160
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,749
- How come I been put outta my locker?
- Because Dipper needed it.

161
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,758
Dipper's a contender, a climber.
Know what you are?

162
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,632
- What?
- A tomato.

163
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,673
Yeah, let's face it. I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

164
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,597
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

165
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,632
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won KO in the second.

166
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,320
- Yeah? Who'd you fight?
- Spider Rico.

167
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,034
<i>(laughs)</i> He's a bum!

168
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,470
- You think everybody I fight is a bum.
- Well, ain't they?

169
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,116
You got heart, but you fight like a
goddamn ape. Nothin' special about you.

170
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,075
You never got your nose busted. Leave it
that way, and what's left of your mind.

171
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
Mick, I think I'll go take a steam.
You know why?

172
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,679
I did real good last night.
You shoulda seen me.

173
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,189
- Big deal.
- You shoulda seen me too.

174
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,471
Hey, kid, you ever think about retiring?

175
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,034
- No.
- You think about it.

176
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,390
- All right. Time!
- <i>(Dipper)</i> Hey, hey!

177
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
- What?
- I dig your locker, man.

178
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,108
Cold night.

179
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,198
Good night to catch pneumonia,
you know?

180
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,999
You need some help with that cage?

181
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,271
There's a good game
down at the Spectrum tonight.

182
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
You wanna go to a basketball game?

183
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,229
- <i>(dog barks)</i>
- Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.

184
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,629
Tough day today.
They took my locker away.

185
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,558
I had that locker for six years,
but it don't bother me.

186
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,399
Lockers are bad.
People get the combination.

187
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,149
I must've had 20 bucks taken
outta there in the past six years.

188
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,430
It don't sound like much, but it adds up.

189
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,154
You know? It doesn't matter. Who cares?

190
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,671
Cold night... Hey, birds!
Hey, look who's here!

191
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,360
Look who's here. The giant worm.

192
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,558
Look at these birds. Don't these birds
look like candy? Like flyin' candy.

193
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,511
Want to fly me home?

194
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,313
Do you need somebody
to walk you home, you know?

195
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,873
No.

196
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,709
It's a cold night. If I was you and
you got the money, I would take a cab.

197
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,354
Too many creeps around here, you know?

198
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,837
Every other block there's a creep.
You can always tell a creep.

199
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,829
All right, listen. I'm gonna go now.
I'll see ya's later, all right?

200
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,555
Now you guys get up.
I know you had a hard day in the cage.

201
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,435
So... I wanna go home, make up a joke.
I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow, OK?

202
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,313
- Good night, Adrian.
- Good night, Rocky.

203
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,116
Yo!

204
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,278
There you go. I got a friend for you here.

205
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,472
- Hello, Rock.
- How you doin'? You seen Paulie?

206
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,477
He's in the steam room.

207
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,353
- Hey, Rocky, what's with the eye?
- Been fightin'.

208
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,837
- Hope ya's won it, at least.
- I did real good. You shoulda seen me.

209
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,994
- Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?
- Spider Rico.

210
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,157
- Hey, is he still around?
- Yeah, he's doin' real good.

211
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,832
He's doin' better than you are, that's
for sure! Hey, Paulie, you lock the door?

212
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,633
I'd like to kill the moron
who broke the mirror.

213
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,830
Hey, yo, Paulie!

214
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,078
Every day, every night I pass by.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.

215
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,670
- Forget her. You could do better than her.
- I don't forget nothin'.

216
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,430
Every night, I pass by the place, I tell
a joke. Every mornin', I tell a joke. Nothin'.

217
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,551
She just looks at me, you know?

218
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,592
- Looks, huh?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

219
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,077
I need a Cadillac to connect with your
sister? Somethin' wrong with my face?

220
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,670
She's a freakin' loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy...

221
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,997
...I could split her head with a razor.
- Don't get mental, man.

222
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,554
- You caught me in a bad mood.
- You always are.

223
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,877
- Adrian ain't sharp. Adrian is a loser.
- Hey!

224
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,391
She's pushin' 30 years old and if she
don't watch out she'll end up dyin' alone.

225
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,875
- I'm 30 myself.
- And <i>you'll</i> end up dyin' alone.

226
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,232
- I don't see no crowd around <i>you.</i>
- I'll kill the moron who broke the mirror.

227
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,670
Come on, let's get outta this stink,
would ya? Come on.

228
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,394
- I wanna talk to you, anyway.
- About what?

229
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,829
- Do you still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

230
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,599
Why don't you talk to him about me?

231
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,271
Well, I just don't think
Gazzo's hirin' right now, you know?

232
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,356
Come on.

233
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,036
- The girl's dryin' up.
- Who?

234
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,516
My sister. If she don't start livin',
her body's gonna dry up.

235
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,428
You know, tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
Come over and talk to her.

236
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,996
- Sure. Beer!
- Tomorrow you come for some bird.

237
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,873
Absolutely. You got it.

238
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,594
I gotta go. If I'm late,
she calls the hospital.

239
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,472
- Paulie!
- I got it.

240

<i>Philadelphia at the fabulous Spectrum.</i>

- Would you take a look at that guy?

244
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,951
Where are the real fighters
gonna come from, the pros?

245
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,640
All we got today are jig clowns.

246
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,393
- Clown?
- That's right, clown.

247

He's champion of the world.

255
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,995
He took his best shot at becoming champ.
What shot did you ever take?

256
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,396
Hey, Rocky, if you're not
happy with your life, that's nice.

257
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,637
But I got a business goin'.
I don't have to take no shots.

258
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,072
<i>... no one having gone more than 12</i>
<i>rounds with him, and that was Jake...</i>

259
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,432
- Stick that up your business.
- What are you so insulted about?

260
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,712
You want me to take a shot?
All right, I'll take a shot!

261
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,280
- Hey, Rocky, how about a bottom?
- No wine, man.

262
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,279
Come on! Just a little.
You're makin' a lot of money.

263
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,675
Marie,
does your brother know you're out?

264
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,679
- Screw you, yo-yo!
- These guys teach you to talk like that?

265
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,475
- Stuff it, man!
- Don't you say that to me. Come here!

266
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,909
Stick up on it!

267
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,110
Swivel on it, ya bum!

268
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,196
Hey, you know, when I was your age...

269
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,440
...there was one girl in the neighbourhood
who talked like that, you know? Just one.

270
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,358
What you doin'?
That'll make your teeth yellow.

271
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,313
- I like yellow teeth.
- And your breath like garbage.

272
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,273
- Maybe I like garbage.
- C'mon, nobody likes garbage.

273
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,630
Anyway, this girl wasn't bad-looking...

274
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,149
...but guys never took her serious,
you see?

275
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,510
- They never took her out for a date.
- Why?

276
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,677
Guys laugh when you talk dirty.
They think you're cute.

277
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,110
If you get a reputation,
you get no respect, you understand?

278
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,676
You get no respect.
I gotta use a bad word.

279
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,075
Whore. You understand? Whore.

280
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,193
You see, if you use dirty words,
you maybe end up becomin' a whore.

281
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,269
- Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.
- Hey, that don't matter you're 12.

282
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,315
You don't really have to be one.
You just act like one, and that's it - boom!

283
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,396
You get a bad rep, you understand?

284
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,308
20 years from now, people are
gonna say "Do you remember Marie?"

285
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,228
"No, who was she?" "The whore that
hung down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

286
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,920
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."

287
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,512
You see, they don't remember <i>you.</i>
They remember the rep, you understand?

288
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,471
Hey, you got a boyfriend?

289
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,558
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.
You know why?

290
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,434
Why don't you? Because you hang out
with them coconuts on the corner.

291
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,916
You hang around with coconuts,
you get nowhere. They're lemons!

292
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,759
Hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends.

293
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,519
Hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

294
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,438
Hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

295
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,996
It's simple mathematics.
I hope you ain't gonna...

296
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,678
- I won't.
- What was I gonna say?

297
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,837
You hope I stop actin'
like a whore or I'll turn into one.

298
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,110
- Somethin' like that.
- Night, Rocky.

299
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,470
- Night, Marie. Take care.
- Hey, Rocky.

300
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,989
- Yo?
- Screw you, creepo!

301
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,354
Yeah, who are you to give advice, creepo?
Who are you?

302
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,957
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

303
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,757
It says that Green has suffered a severely
cracked third metacarpal in his left hand.

304
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,074
We can cancel the fight indefinitely
if you're set on fighting Green.

305
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,478
Hey, it ain't just Green! What about
all the time Apollo has invested?

306
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,398
- I believe we can find a solution.
- Solution nothin'.

307
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,114
Find me another contender in a flash,
Jergens.

308
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,677
Don't play games with my client. He's
done a million dollars' worth of publicity...

309
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,519
...and has made contractual obligations.

310
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,599
- He's not going to be embarrassed!
- I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

311
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,633
- Ernie is fighting in France that week.
- Buddy Shaw. He's ranked fifth.

312
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,788
Went to California and gained 50 pounds.
I got hold of every worthwhile contender...

313
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,674
...and they all say five weeks
isn't enough time to get into shape.

314
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,157
Shape nothin', man! They afraid! They
know everybody's gonna see the fight.

315
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,874
None of 'em can whip me.
They're makin' excuses...

316
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,072
...so they don't get whipped
in front of the whole world.

317
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,033
All I can say is I'm a good promoter.

318
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,391
I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world...

319
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,275
...and I've broken my ass over this,
but I don't know what the hell else to do.

320
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,877
I do.

321
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,472
Without a ranked contender,
what this fight is gonna need is a novelty.

322
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,875
This is the land of opportunity, right?

323
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,870
So Apollo Creed on January 1 gives
a local underdog fighter an opportunity.

324
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,152
A snow-white underdog. And I'm gonna
put his face on this poster with me.

325
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,872
And I'll tell you why.

326
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,676
Because I'm sentimental,
like a lot of other people in this country.

327
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,998
There's nothing they'd like better than
to see Apollo Creed give a local boy...

328
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,908
...a shot at the world title
on this country's biggest birthday.

329
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,429
Now <i>that's</i> the way I see it.

330
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,596
And that's the way it's gonna be.

331
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,711
Apollo, I like it!

332
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,149
It's very American.

333
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,033
No, Jergens. It's very smart.

334
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,555
<i>(Jergens laughs)</i>

335
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,949
- What is it?
- I just wanna check this out.

336
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,356
I pick up two yards from Snyder
and a grand from Cappoli?

337
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,314
No, no. Two yards from Cappoli
and a grand from Snyder.

338
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,671
- Two yards. Yeah, I got it.
- OK, write it down, OK?

339
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,270
Who's this girl you're
goin' out with tomorrow night?

340
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,358
- How d'you know?
- Don't you think I hear things?

341
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,951
- A lot of canaries flyin' around the docks.
- I'm goin' out with Paulie's sister.

342
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,709
- I hear she's retarded.
- She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?

343
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,356
I'll tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.

344
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,835
- This bum gotta say that?
- You callin' me a bum?

345
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,111
- I'm callin' <i>you</i> a bum!
- OK, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.

346
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,595
- It's his prostate.
- He's always in a bad mood.

347
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,996
Count your blessings, Buddy.
You're still healthy.

348
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,350
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours!

349
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,277
- Kiss my ass!
- Move!

350
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,349
Relax! Relax! Relax! My ears! What,
are you drivin' me crazy? Both of ya's.

351
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,397
Buddy doesn't like ya. Some guys,
they just hate for no reason, you got me?

352
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,476
- Yeah.
- Come here.

353
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,512
There's 50 bucks.
You and Adrian, you have a nice time.

354
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,756
Thanks.

355
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,239
- Hey, how'd you know her name?
- You don't think I hear things?

356
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,718
- <i>(Buddy)</i> Remember what I told you.
- What'd you tell me?

357
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,990
Take her to the zoo!

358
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,594
- Some more coffee, Mr Creed?
- No thanks, Shirley.

359
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,678
- What do you think about Billy Snow?
- Fouls.

360
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,796
- How about Big Chuck Smith?
- Yeah.

361
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,629
No, he's too old and dull.
Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.

362
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,675
- No, I don't feel the heat from that name.
- Joe Zack's a good prospect.

363
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,076
Exactly what <i>are</i> you lookin' for, Apollo?

364
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,599
This is what I'm lookin' for.
The Italian Stallion.

365
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,835
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.

366
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,190
Look, it's the name, man.

367
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,959
The Italian Stallion.

368
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,631
The media'll eat it up. Now who
discovered America? An Italian, right?

369
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,070
What would be better than
to get it on with a descendant?

370
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,272
He's a southpaw.
I don't want you messin' with them.

371
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,155
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothin'! I'll drop him in three.

372
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,273
"Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion."

373
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,671
Sounds like a damn monster movie!

374
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,475
What are you doin' with that bat?
I used to be deadly at stickball.

375
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,754
- You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
- Very excited. Look at my swollen hands.

376
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,077
The joints, from carrying meat
in and out of freezers.

377
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,272
- Plays hell on the joints.
- Maybe you oughta see a doctor.

378
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,868
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

379
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,151
- What kind of turkey? Big or small?
- Talk to Gazzo about me.

380
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,670
Tell him I'm a good man
and nothin' bothers me.

381
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,349
I'd make a great collector.
Bustin' bones don't bother me.

382
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,190
A big turkey, right? Hey, forget Gazzo.
That's a bad job, you know what I mean?

383
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,676
- You got a match?
- Go to him for me, as a favour.

384
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,519
Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey...

385
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,237
...it was when they had a $2 special
at Horn & Hardart's about three years ago.

386
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,234
- Your sister knows I'm comin', for sure?
- Yeah, she's gonna be excited.

387
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,153
Hey, will you forget about Gazzo, huh?

388
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,511
- I don't ask nobody twice.
- You don't ask nobody twice.

389
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,393
# Stay away, baby

390
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,797
- You sure your sister knows I'm comin'?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

391
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,914
<i>(Adrian)</i> Paulie! You're late.

392
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,989
You called the hospital? She calls
the hospital if I'm ten minutes late.

393
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,270
<i>(Rocky)</i> Yo, how you doin'?

394
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,755
I told you she's very excited.

395
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,715
Why didn't you say
you were bringin' him?

396
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,276
- Look at me. I'm not ready.
- Would it make a difference if you were?

397
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,075
- He's a friend and he's takin' you out.
- No, I can't.

398
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,749
I want you outta the kitchen
and I want you out right now.

399
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,235
I won't.

400
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,033
Hey! Hey!

401
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,069
Hey, I want you outta here instamatically!

402
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,876
I'm sick of seein' you hangin' around
like a spider! Go out and live! Enjoy life!

403
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,436
- Paulie, I can't go!
- Don't get wise with me now.

404
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,269
- I'm tired of you bein' a loser.
- Don't call me that, Paulie!

405
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,198
<i>(TV) Apollo Creed is</i>
<i>shopping for another "victim"...</i>

406
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,029
<i>... to fill Green's vacancy for the</i>
<i>Bicentennial championship fight...</i>

407
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,674
You didn't tell me
you were bringin' him home!

408
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,837
I'm not gonna go, Paulie!
I can't go! I won't go!

409
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,871
Why?

410
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,788
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I got a turkey in the oven.

411
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,753
Oh. A turkey in the oven?

412
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,836
Oh.

413
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,591
You want the bird?

414
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,836
Go in the alley and eat the bird!

415
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,190
Oh, Paulie!

416
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,118
I want you outta here!
Get outta the house!

417
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,635
Go out and enjoy your freakin' life!

418
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,275
You hungry, Rock?

419
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,435
Hey, yo, Paulie. Maybe we'd just
better forget all this, you know?

420
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,711
- Just forget it.
- Forget nothin'. Say somethin' funny.

421
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,957
Ain't nothin' to say.
She's in a bad mood, I'm in a bad mood...

422
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,640
You know how to do funny.
Wanna go out with her?

423
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,115
- Yeah.
- Well...

424
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,800
- I don't know what to say.
- Funny.

425
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,674
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

426
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,791
Rocky, you know?

427
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,876
Listen, uh...

428
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,638
I dunno what to say, cos I ain't never
talked to no door before, you know?

429
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,912
- I mean, what do I say to a door? Listen...
- Come on, you're doin' fine.

430
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,270
I ain't doin' fine. I look like an idiot.

431
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,552
Keep doin' what you're doin'.
Funny. I know all about these things.

432
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,636
I feel like a jerk.

433
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,635
Yo, Adrian. It's Rocky again, you know?

434
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,830
Listen, uh...

435
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
I know you ain't too happy
at this moment.

436
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,077
Well, could you do me a favour? I ain't
got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with.

437
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,069
So, uh, how about maybe you and I could
go out together and get somethin' to eat?

438
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,873
I don't know,
maybe laugh a little bit. Who knows?

439
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,355
Would you like to, uh...

440
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:02,269
I don't know. Would you like to maybe,
you know, you and me go out together?

441
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,788
We're gonna have a good time.

442
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,310
We'll have a real good time, you know?

443
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,795
Thanks for the bird.

444
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,478
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

445
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,475
- What's your sister like to do?
- Ice-skate.

446
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,549
Adrian, come on, you're lettin' the heat
out. Who pays the bills around here?

447
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,589
Listen, uh, I don't want
no turkey anyway, you know?

448
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,189
- But it was Thanksgiving.
- It was what?

449
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,472
- It was Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, to you, but to me it's Thursday.

450
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,548
- Yo, looks kinda quiet.
- I think it's closed.

451
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,717
No, I think we're just early
or somethin' like that.

452
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,034
- Yo!
- Yo!

453
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,071
- We're closed!
- What?

454
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,919
- I said we're closed!
- Yeah. Hey, listen...

455
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,191
...l'm gonna smooth this guy out.
Wait here for a few minutes.

456
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,515
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's OK.

457
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,950
Are you closed to the general public
or closed to everybody?

458
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,392
It's after six o'clock. It's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

459
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,638
Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here,
so do me a favour and leave, huh?

460
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,548
- Could you do me a favour?
- Hey, come on, we're not operatin'.

461
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,319
Look... this girl here ain't feelin' well.

462
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,877
The doctor says she should exercise
and ice-skating's the best thing.

463
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,198
- Yeah? So what do you want from me?
- Do me a favour. She ain't feelin' good.

464
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,676
So if you could let her on the ice,
I'd appreciate it.

465
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,588
- Ten minutes, ten bucks.
- Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?

466
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,950
Come on! It's Thanksgiving.

467
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,029
- All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.
- You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.

468
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,238
Gimme the blades.

469
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,112
- Aren't you skating?
- No, I ain't skated since I was 15.

470
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,549
That's when I started fightin'.

471
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,150
- Skating's bad for the ankles, you know?
- Yeah.

472
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,840
You're a pretty good skater, ain't ya?

473
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,993
Like I was sayin' on the way over, fightin'
used to be tops with me, but no more.

474
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,634
All I wanted to do was
prove I was no bum...

475
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,069
...that I had the stuff to make a good pro.

476
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,670
- You never got the chance?
- I ain't cryin', cos I still fight.

477
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,156
I kinda do it like a hobby.
The trouble is, I'm a southpaw.

478
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,158
- What's a southpaw?
- It means you're left-handed.

479
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,510
A southpaw throws your timin' off, see?

480
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,428
Other guys, it makes 'em look awkward.
Nobody wants to look awkward.

481
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,996
- You know where southpaw came from?
- <i>(attendant)</i> Nine minutes!

482
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,908
A long time ago, a couple of hundred
years ago, this guy was fightin'.

483
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,350
I think it was around Philadelphia.
He was left-handed.

484
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,789
His arm was facin' towards New Jersey.

485
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,037
And that's south,
so they called him Southpaw.

486
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,754
You see? Southpaw, South Jersey...

487
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,997
...South Camden, Southpaw...
You know what I mean?

488
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,551
Things worked out for the best.

489
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,194
You never got a chance,
being left-handed?

490
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,869
Well, that's absolutely true,
you know? Watch out, watch out.

491
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,833
Agh! Agh! Agh!

492
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,157
I just dislocated my finger.
Agh! Look at that.

493
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,589
No, hey, wait! It ain't your fault. Look.

494
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,632
See? Look.
It's an old wound. You see that?

495
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,435
Look. See? Nothin'.
It bends like that. I originally done it...

496
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,516
Push the button... Bong! It works.

497
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,996
- It ain't your fault. I'll show you...
- Seven minutes!

498
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,032
I originally done it...
I keep pictures of all my fights.

499
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,594
I done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. See?

500
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,713
He's the size of an airplane.
I broke both my hands.

501
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,676
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think? See how it works there?

502
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,791
Come on. Are you havin' a good time?

503
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,833
I'll tell ya, you can see I ain't too graceful.
I don't move well.

504
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,872
But I can really swat, you know?
I can really hit hard.

505
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,949
But I'm a southpaw and nobody wants to
fight a southpaw, you know what I mean?

506
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,995
Whooo!
You know how I got started in fightin'?

507
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,076
- Huh?
- No.

508
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,191
Am I talkin' too loud?

509
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,673
- No.
- Three minutes!

510
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,157
My father, he's...
My old man, he was never too smart.

511
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,717
He says to me "You weren't born
much of a brain, so start usin' your body."

512
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,195
So I've become a fighter.

513
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,676
You know what I mean?
Why are you laughin'?

514
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,759
My mother, she said the opposite thing.

515
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,519
What did she say?
What did she say, the opposite?

516
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,633
"You weren't born much of a body,
so you'd better develop your brain."

517
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,797
- Did she say that?
- Yo! Time!

518
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,398
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

519
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,598
- Why do you wanna fight?
- Cos I can't sing or dance.

520
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,312
Hey, yo!

521
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,079
Don't fall! Don't fall!

522
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,875
Hey, that was terrific. I'm good at this.
You like the way I skate?

523
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,878
The last fight I had was
with a guy named Spider Rico.

524
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,594
He bust my head up.
Do you see that scar?

525
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,518
I'll tell ya,
things get pretty rough in the ring.

526
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,155
You know, some people are
very shy by nature, you know?

527
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,236
I suppose.

528
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,313
I say you're very shy by nature,
you know?

529
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,396
Yeah... I suppose.

530
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,198
Hey! Hey!

531
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,551
The bum from the dock.
Get a job, ya bum!

532
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,151
You know, some people think bein' shy
is a disease, but it don't bother me none.

533
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,430
It don't bother me, either.

534
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,154
Why did I bother bringin' it up?
Cos I'm dumb, that's why.

535
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,595
I think we make a real sharp couple
of coconuts. I'm dumb, you're shy.

536
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,315
I don't understand why anybody
would wanna be a fighter.

537
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,476
Hey, you gotta be a moron.

538
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,956
You gotta be a moron to wanna be
a fighter, you know what I mean?

539
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,390
It's a racket where you're almost
guaranteed to end up a bum.

540
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,910
- I don't think you're a bum.
- I'm at least half a bum, you know?

541
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,759
I'll tell ya somethin'.

542
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,395
The worst thing about fightin'
is the mornin' after, you know?

543
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,150
I'll tell ya. The mornin' after a fight, you're
nothin' but a large wound, you know?

544
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,236
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

545
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,796
I wanna call a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

546
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,471
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt, your face
is all busted up, your hands is swollen.

547
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,752
Look at this face. 64 fights.
Look at that nose. See that nose?

548
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,110
That nose ain't been broken in 64 fights.

549
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,597
I've had guys bustin' on it,
chewin' on it, twistin' it, punchin' it.

550
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,759
I mean, whack, boom. These guys
are hittin' my nose all the time.

551
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,350
Never broke. I'm proud of that.
Ain't that rare? That's rare.

552
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,597
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why you think?

553
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,675
- Cos you can't sing or dance?
- Yeah, somethin' like that.

554
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,870
Hey, you wanna come inside?

555
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,232
- No, I gotta go.
- Hey, come on. I got some animals.

556
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,114
I got these very rare animals inside.
Come on. Come on in.

557
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,030
- No, no. I gotta go.
- I gotta go too. I gotta go to the bathroom.

558
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,674
- Go on.
- No, I gotta go.

559
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,712
Hey, look at this face.
Is that a face you could trust?

560
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,550
Huh? Is it? They oughta stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

561
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,035
Huh? Come on. Come on in.

562
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,670
Yo.

563
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,636
Flick.

564
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,232
- Yo, Adrian, you hungry?
- No.

565
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,956
I got some things in there. I got soda,
some doughnuts or somethin'.

566
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,275
A couple of cupcakes, huh?

567
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,517
No? I think I got some chocolate in there.

568
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,596
No?

569
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,835
Hot in here, you know?

570
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,595
I could go for some music.

571
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,392
Yo, Adrian.

572
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,080
These are the exotic animals
I told you about.

573
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,431
- These are my friends Cuff and Link.
- I sold 'em to ya.

574
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,314
Sure, I know you sold 'em to me.
You were workin' at that pet shop.

575
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,796
First day you was there,
I bought both these animals.

576
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,675
Sure, I remember that. I bought this bowl
and I bought the animals themselves...

577
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,758
...the food,
the marbles that go on the bottom there.

578
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,637
Remember that mountain? I had to get rid
of it, cos they kept fallin' over and flippin'.

579
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,353
Yo, why don't you come on
over here and sit down?

580
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,311
Hm?

581
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,590
It's a nice couch. I don't know...

582
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,348
There's big bugs in there, you know?
It's safer over here.

583
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,116
You wanna sit down?

584
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,635
Are these your parents?

585
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,990
Yeah, that's both of 'em there.

586
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,634
- Is this you?
- Yeah, that's me when I was eight.

587
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,957
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

588
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,237
Why don't you come on over and
make yourself comfortable? Relax.

589
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,634
- Do you have a phone?
- No, I ain't got no phone.

590
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,957
I had it pulled,
cos of people callin' all the time.

591
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,550
Who needs the aggravation, right?
The interruptions.

592
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,832
- Who do you wanna call?
- I wanna let my brother know where I am.

593
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,149
Why?

594
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,035
- I think he might be worried.
- Well, I'll call him, if that's the problem.

595
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,230
Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!
I'll call ya's back later! See ya!

596
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,630
You don't like the room, do ya?

597
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,832
- It's fine.
- Well, it's only temporary, you know?

598
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,076
It's not that.

599
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,389
What's the problem? You don't like <i>me?</i>
Or the turtles? What's the problem?

600
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,478
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's OK.

601
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,275
I don't belong here.

602
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,439
Well, you know, it's OK,
cos you're my guest, you know?

603
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,313
I don't... know you well enough.

604
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,228
I've never been in
a man's apartment alone.

605
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,398
Well, I have.
They're all the same, you know?

606
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,680
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

607
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,876
I don't feel comfortable.

608
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,754
Yo, Adrian, you know,
I ain't so comfortable either.

609
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,271
- I should go.
- Don't go, please. Don't go.

610
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,709
Don't go. Don't go.

611
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,796
Don't go.

612
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,239
- Do me a favour?
- What?

613
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,715
Take off these glasses.

614
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,195
You have nice eyes, you know?

615
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,393
Do me another favour?

616
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,875
Would you take off that hat?

617
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,195
I always knew you was pretty.

618
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,913
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasin' ya.

619
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,719
I ain't teasin' ya.

620
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,195
I just... I wanna kiss ya.

621
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,917
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't want...

622
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,996
...but I wanna kiss you.

623
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,796
I heard you had a fight comin' up.

624
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,798
Yeah, I'm gonna fight next month,
January 27th.

625
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,914
That's good, man. You come on down
the gym. We'll see that you get in shape.

626
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,951
Hey, Rock, how you doin'?

627
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,152
- Mick was lookin' for you up there, man.
- For me? You sure?

628
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,432
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was lookin' for you.
Get on up there and see him.

629
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,718
- You got somethin' for me?
- A guy from Miles Jergens was here.

630
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,753
- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
- When was he here?

631
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,953
- About an hour ago.
- Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.

632
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,033
I said that before, you dumb dago!

633
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,312
I've been comin' here for six years
and you always stick it to me. How come?

634
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,318
- You don't wanna know!
- Yeah, I wanna know how come!

635
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,476
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know!

636
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,196
OK, I'm gonna tell ya! Cos you had
the talent to become a good fighter!

637
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,039
And instead of that,
you became a leg-breaker...

638
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,197
...to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!

639
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,232
- It's a livin'.
- It's a waste of life!

640
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,390
Yes? May I help you?

641
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,310
Oh! You must be Mr Rocky Balboa.

642
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,398
Mr Jergens is expecting you.
Just a moment.

643
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,913
Mr Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

644
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,951
Fine.

645
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,355
- Please go in, Mr Balboa.
- Can I have that?

646
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,835
- Oh, certainly.
- Thanks.

647
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,196
Mr Balboa.

648
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,790
How are you? George Jergens.
Take a chair, please.

649
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,876
Thanks.

650
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,240
- Mr Balboa...
- You can call me Rocky.

651
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,751
Rocky. Tell me, Rocky. You got any
representation? You have a manager?

652
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,836
Uh, no, just me.

653
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,509
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

654
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,871
- About sparrin'?
- I beg your pardon?

655
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,357
I know you're lookin' for sparrin' partners
and I wanna say I'm very available.

656
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,677
- I'm sure you are.
- Absolutely. It would be an honour.

657
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,758
And you know what?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

658
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,670
- I'd really be a good sparrin' partner.
- You don't understand me, Rocky.

659
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,669
My proposition's this. Would you be
interested in fighting Apollo Creed...

660
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,553
...for the world
heavyweight championship?

661
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,235
- No.
- Listen, Rocky...

662
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,596
...Apollo's seen you fight.

663
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,038
He likes you. He wants to fight you.

664
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,914
Well, it's just that, you see, uh,
I fight in clubs, you know?

665
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,431
I'm really a ham and egger. This guy is
the best. It wouldn't be such a good fight.

666
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,348
But thank you very much,
you know? I appreciate it.

667
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,952
Rocky, do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

668
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,912
Yeah.

669
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,031
Apollo Creed does.

670
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,790
And he's gonna prove it to the world
by giving an unknown a shot at the title.

671
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,639
And that unknown is you.

672
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,910
He picked you, Rocky.

673
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,837
Rocky, it's the chance of a lifetime.

674
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,110
You can't pass it by.

675
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,150
What do ya say?

676
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,868
<i>All right. That's enough pictures.</i>
<i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>

677
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,394
<i>How do you like</i>
<i>the city of brotherly love?</i>

678
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,830
<i>Well, just bein' in Philadelphia</i>
<i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>

679
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,509
<i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i>
<i>wishin' me the best.</i>

680
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,996
<i>I love my Philadelphia brothers.</i>
<i>I'm proud to be an American.</i>

681
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,671
<i>Apollo, why did you agree to fight a man</i>
<i>who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>

682
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,916
<i>Look, if history proves one thing...</i>

683
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,555
<i>American history proves that</i>
<i>everybody's got a chance to win.</i>

684
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,150
<i>Didn't you guys ever hear of</i>
<i>Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

685
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,352
<i>It is a coincidence that</i>
<i>you're fighting a white man...</i>

686
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,675
<i>... on the most celebrated day</i>
<i>in US history?</i>

687
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,193
<i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence that he's</i>
<i>fightin' a black man on the same day?</i>

688
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,276
<i>Right on! Tell the truth, brother!</i>

689
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,789
<i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>

690
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,878
<i>How do I feel about him?</i>
<i>Come here, Rock.</i>

691
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,834
<i>- My main man. Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>

692
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,511
<i>- Well now, what does that mean?</i>
<i>- If he can't fight, I bet he can cook!</i>

693
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,914
- Do me a favour. His lungs, punch out.
- Paulie!

694
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,316
<i>Rocky,</i>
<i>how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed?</i>

695
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,399
<i>Well, jeez, Creed's the best.</i>
<i>I guess I'll have to do the best I can.</i>

696
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,193
<i>Tell me, Rocky. Just between us...</i>

697
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,118
<i>... where did you get</i>
<i>the name "ltalian Stallion"?</i>

698
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,472
<i>Oh, I invented that about eight years ago</i>
<i>when I was eatin' dinner.</i>

699
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:17,470
<i>Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.</i>
<i>Any comment?</i>

700
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,390
<i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

701
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,238
<i>No comment, right.</i>

702
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,830
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, OK?</i>

703
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,078
<i>Yo, Adrian! It's me, Rocky.</i>
<i>Look at this. Can you believe all this?</i>

704
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,033
Rocky, you didn't...!

705
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,958
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
<i>- Quit pushin', man!</i>

706
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,149
<i>Thank you, Rocky.</i>

707
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,114
Don't it matter he's makin' you out a fool?
I'd break his lips.

708
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,277
- He's takin' cheap shots.
- It don't bother me none.

709
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,235
Yo, Rock. I guess you'd be lookin'
for people to help you out.

710
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,920
- Help what?
- You know...

711
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,715
- Keep you livin' a clean life.
- I do OK, you know?

712
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,992
You need someone to help with
the exercise, stand by with a towel...

713
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,758
...run errands.

714
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,715
Who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.
I think I'm gonna train myself, you know?

715
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:12,550
Without such good people around to help,
you don't have such a good chance.

716
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,478
Einstein flunked outta school. Twice.

717
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,795
- That so?
- Yeah.

718
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,199
Beethoven was deaf, Helen Keller was
blind. I think Rocky's got a good chance.

719
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,475
- Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
- You lookin' to do a good deed?

720
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,319
Keep outta my freakin' life!

721
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,636
- What did I do?
- Nothin'.

722
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,479
- Did I say something?
- You didn't say nothin'.

723
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,673
That's right, you didn't say nothin'!
Nothin' at all!

724
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,196
I gotta go.

725
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,115
Where's the freakin' pretzels?

726
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,549
Goddamn the pretzels!
Hey, we don't have any beer!

727
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,036
I thought you were supposed
to pick up some beer!

728
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,556
How'd you like hearin'
your name on TV tonight?

729
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,194
I was shocked. Why'd you do that?

730
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,029
- Come on, you're puttin' me on, right?
- Absolutely.

731
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,789
- What time should I expect you?
- Oh, about seven.

732
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,876
Hey.

733
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,756
Hey.

734
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,190
You know I said that stuff on TV
didn't bother me none?

735
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,276
Yeah?

736
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,876
It did.

737
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,636
Listen, the reason I've
brought you here is because...

738
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,069
Have you got money
for trainin' expenses?

739
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,988
- I got a few dollars, you know?
- Well, here. Put this in your glove.

740
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,476
- What's this?
- 500 bucks. Don't worry about it.

741
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,473
You ain't never had any luck, but this time
Lady Luck may be in your corner.

742
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,478
- What do ya think?
- Maybe. Maybe...

743
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:26,674
- Hey, thanks for the money, Tony.
- It's OK. Don't worry about it. See ya.

744
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,199
- Wait a minute.
- What?

745
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,073
- You're in trainin'. Huh? Come on.
- Hey.

746
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,596
- Yo, Tony?
- What?

747
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,711
You gonna show up at the fight?

748
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,956
- Ringside.
- Hey, hey!

749
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,516
I'll see ya.

750
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,476
<i>(Rocky)</i> Yeah!

751
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,436
Hello, kid. I seen your light.
Can I come in?

752
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,630
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Good!

753
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,399
Hey, this is a nice place here.

754
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,557
Anyway, what I come to tell you
is that, uh...

755
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,837
...that what happened to you is freak luck.

756
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,997
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true? Look at the other guys.

757
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,795
They're good fighters.
They're colourful, they got good records.

758
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,150
They fight their guts out for peanuts.

759
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,193
But you... you got a shot at the title.

760
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,710
- Freak luck is a strange thing.
- Yeah, sure it is. Can I sit down?

761
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,149
Yeah, sure.

762
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,636
- What the hell are those?
- Oh, they're domestic turtles.

763
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,230
The one on top is Cuff and
the other is Link. The rest are marbles.

764
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,670
Yeah? They make good soup, do they?

765
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,236
Anyway, look, I'm here to warn ya...

766
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,638
...that you gotta be very careful
about this shot that you got at the title.

767
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,595
Because, I don't know, like the Bible says,
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

768
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,671
- Yeah, all right.
- You thought of that, huh?

769
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,837
Well, what you need is a manager.

770
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,796
A manager. Listen to me.

771
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,356
I know, because I've been
in this racket for 50 years.

772
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,597
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years. God, I've seen it all.

773
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,359
All of it. You know what I done?

774
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,914
- What?
- I have done it all.

775
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,589
You shoulda seen me when
I knocked Giny Russel outta the ring.

776
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,599
Outta the goddamn ring, I tell ya.
September 14, 1923.

777
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,599
And it was the same night that
Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring.

778
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,632
- The same night. Who gets the publicity?
- Dempsey.

779
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,955
- That's right, but why?
- Cos he was champ.

780
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,072
No! Because he had a manager.

781
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,714
I had nothin', man.

782
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,276
I wanna show you somethin'.
Look at my face for a minute. Look.

783
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,110
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

784
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,596
You know what?
I had my nose busted 17 times.

785
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,713
The last time was with
that fight with Sailor Mike.

786
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,718
I got the clippin' here. A good fight.

787
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,671
Read that.

788
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,756
Well, it doesn't matter.

789
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,952
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.

790
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,232
Ah, Rocky Marciano!

791
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,273
You know, you kinda remind me
of the Rock, do you know that?

792
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,870
- You really think so?
- That's right. You move like him.

793
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,956
And you got heart, like he did.

794
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,197
Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

795
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,354
Uh... anyway, you know...

796
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,358
...when I begun in this business, kid...

797
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,996
Look, I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

798
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,715
It's no good for ya.
You don't mind my sayin'...?

799
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:19,277
Anyway, when I started this racket,
pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.

800
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,872
For $10, you gotta tear somebody's throat
out. But I never had no management.

801
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,076
One time, this son of a bitch
that I fought, he put a nail right there.

802
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,270
- In his thumb?
- Yeah, in the glove.

803
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,755
And he punched
so many holes in my face...

804
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,795
...I had this spit shootin' outta my cheeks.
Can you imagine that?

805
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,276
When I tell you what I looked like
when I was in my prime...

806
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,153
I want ya to look at somethin'.
Will ya look at that?

807
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:50,273
That's the way I looked
before these guys got at me.

808
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,790
That's nice.
You don't take care of the picture, though.

809
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,833
Well, I never had no management.
That was the trouble.

810
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,351
Now I got all this knowledge.
I got it up here and I wanna give it to you.

811
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,871
I wanna take care of you. I wanna make
sure all this shit that happened to me...

812
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,515
...doesn't happen to you.
You know what I mean?

813
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,269
- The fight's set.
- Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.

814
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,949
- You follow that, do you?
- The fight's set. I don't need no manager.

815
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,471
But you can't buy what I'm gonna give ya.
I've got pain and I've got experience.

816
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,637
I got pain and I got experience too.

817
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,275
- Now listen, kid...
- Hey, yo. Hey, Mick.

818
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,279
I needed your help about ten years ago.
You never helped me none.

819
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,472
- You didn't care.
- Well, if you wanted help...

820
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,479
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you just ask me, kid?

821
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,956
Look, I asked,
but you never heard nothin'!

822
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,036
Well, I...

823
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,796
I, uh...

824
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,955
I'm 76 years old.

825
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,956
And, uh...

826
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,356
Ah, shit.

827
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,273
Took you long enough to get here.

828
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,076
Ten years to come to my house. What's
the matter? You don't like my house?

829
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,430
My house stink?

830
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,790
That's right. It stinks!

831
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,229
I didn't ask no favours from you!

832
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,351
Don't throw it around!

833
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,713
Talkin' about your prime.
What about <i>my</i> prime, Mick?

834
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,475
At least you had a prime!

835
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,549
I ain't had no prime! I ain't had nothin'!
Legs are goin', everything's goin'!

836
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:05,674
Guy offers me a fight. Big deal! Wanna
fight the fight? Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

837
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,190
I'm gonna go and fight that big fight.
I'm gonna get that!

838
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,959
I'm gonna get that!

839
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,833
And you wanna be ringside and see it?
Do ya?

840
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,873
You wanna help me out? Huh? Do you
wanna see me get my face kicked in?

841
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,676
Legs ain't workin', nothing's workin'!
They go "Go on, fight the champ!"

842
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,756
Yeah, I'll fight him.

843
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,559
Get my face kicked in.

844
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:35,629
You come around here! You wanna move
in with me? Come on in! It's a nice house!

845
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,718
Real nice! Come on in and move! It stinks!

846
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,835
This whole place stinks!

847
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,477
You wanna help me out?
Well, help me out!

848
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,478
Come on! Help me out! I'm standin' here!

849
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,637

<i>Boy, I need somethin' to struggle with.</i>

863
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:44,394
<i>We've been getting away with murder</i>

864
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,069
<i>Tonight we're back down in the 20 range,</i>
<i>colder in the suburbs.</i>

865
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,909

866
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,511

867
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:17,232
Come on. It stinks... Hey, come on!
It stinks in here, you know?

868
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,316
Yeah, I know.

869
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,679
Hey, do you kill all these things?

870
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,155
No, across the street.

871
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,393
This place looks like an animal morgue,
you know?

872
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,478
- It's a little cold in here, ain't it?
- Yeah.

873
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,275
Who killed all these things?

874
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,790
- What, are you crazy?
- Pay Gazzo or you end up on a hook.

875
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,229
Hey, Gazzo's a good man. You know that.

876
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,798
Hey, don't get excited. I know that. That's
why I want you to talk to him about me.

877
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,309
I can get me out of this stinkin' freezer.

878
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,719
Why don't you do yourself a favour?
Keep this job, because you eat better.

879
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,593
Moo... Does it ever snow in here?

880
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:08,039
Uh, you and my sister.
How are you gettin' along together?

881
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,956
How you think?

882
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,913
Uh, I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?

883
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,439
- About what?
- What's the story? What's happening?

884
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,518
- You really like her?
- Sure I like her.

885
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,190
I don't see it. What's the attraction?

886
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,630
I don't know. It fills gaps, I guess.

887
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,753
- What's "gaps"?
- I don't know. She's got gaps, I got gaps.

888
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,474
Together we fill gaps. I don't know...

889
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,830
You ballin' her?

890
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,313
Hey!

891
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,398
Hey, you don't talk dirty about your sister.

892
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,155
You screwin' my sister?

893
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,510
You see? That's why I can't
connect you with Gazzo, Paulie.

894
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,679
Because you got a big mouth, you know?
You just talk too much.

895
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,873
- It's gettin' cold in here. I'm goin' home.
- Cold in here?! It <i>is</i> cold in here!

896
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,197
It stinks in here! And you stink!

897
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,750
<i>(cracking)</i>

898
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,440
You're breakin' the ribs.

899
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:57,632
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

900
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,840
I'll see you tomorrow mornin', OK?

901
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,354
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

902
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,235
You know, your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

903
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,476
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just sore, OK? I'll just sit here.

904
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,955
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

905
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,078
Hey, come on. No foolin' around, all right?

906
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,077
I'm tired.

907
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,156
Hey, Adrian, I'm serious now.

908
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:51,159
There's no foolin' around durin' trainin'.
I wanna stay strong.

909
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,238
- You're not kiddin'.
- No, I ain't kiddin'.

910
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,711
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

911
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,434
Why don't you just make the meat, OK?

912
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,390
OK, I'll make the meat.

913
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,996
Yo.

914
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,188
- It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

915
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,276
Hey.

916
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,196
Hey, c'mon.

917
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,036
C'mon.

918
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,750
Underneath. Underneath.

919
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,599
Underneath! Underneath! Come on!

920
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,188
Rock, hold it, hold it.
Hold it, Rock, will ya?

921
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,869
You're drivin' me crazy,
you're so sloppy. You're off balance.

922
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,790
Let's try this. Take this string. Tie it
to both ankles. Leave two feet of slack.

923
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,549
- I ain't never had good footwork.
- Never mind. You're off balance.

924
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:26,595
Marciano... He had the same problem
and this string cured it.

925
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:30,952
The idea is that if you can move
and hit without breakin' the string...

926
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,789
...you got balance. You become
a dangerous person. You follow?

927
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,354
- You're lookin' good, Rock.
- Thanks.

928
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,198
That's it. Underneath!

929
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,709
Hey, Rock, how about an autograph?

930
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,992
Get outta here! Don't you ever interrupt
me while I'm conductin' business.

931
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,714
Move your little chicken asses out.

932
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,628
Listen, kid. You...
You lay off that pet-shop dame.

933
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,069
Women weaken legs.

934
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,472
- Yeah, but I really like this girl...
- Then let her train ya!

935
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,958
- OK, no more foolin' around.
- OK, now hit it.

936
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,793
Women weaken legs, huh?

937
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,955
- Yo, Rock!
- Yo, Rocky!

938
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,115
Yo!

939
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,629
- Yo!
- Yo, you look great.

940
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,149
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Terrific.

941
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,555
I mean, you're gonna be a heartbreaker.

942
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,514
You'll walk down the street,
breakin' hearts. Very sharp.

943
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,438
- I got another surprise for you.
- What?

944
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,791
Hey, Butkus! Hey, Butkus,
gimme a kiss! Come here!

945
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,230
- To keep you company when you run.

947
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,833
Come and meet the family.
The owner never come back?

948
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,633
- He's yours if you want him.
- Boy, do I want him!

949
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,513
- What's he eat, this dog?
- He eats little turtles.

950
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,790
Yo, Butkus!

951
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,715
What's that, Butkus, huh?
Whose truck is this? C'mon.

952
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,560
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

953
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,238
- You need exposure.
- Don't breathe on me, Paulie.

954
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,920
That's the big time...
I know about these things.

955
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,396
- What do these guys want from me, huh?
- To watch you train.

956
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,273
Hey, what is the matter with you?
This is private.

957
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,631
- I'm doin' you a favour.
- No, you're embarrassin' me...

958
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,672
...in front of everybody,
in front of your sister.

959
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,509
You see this cigar? Stick it in your ear.
Don't do these things to me.

960
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,758
You shoulda called me up or somethin'.
Leave a message. Don't do that!

961
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,235
My sister really likes you.

962
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,635
- I'm gonna kill you one of these days!
- Come on, come on.

963
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,716
- Pretty...
- Baby.

964
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,152
Here he is, the next heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

965
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,397
Rocky Balboa, we wanna get
a brief interview in with you.

966
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,999
- What about me?
- What about you?

967
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,395
- In charge of the meat.
- Stand behind it.

968
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,670
Listen, just settle down. Just relax.

969
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,394
What we're going to do
is ask you a few questions...

970
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,909
...about your unique training method.

971
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,635
Talk to the folks at home.
They wanna know how you got into this.

972
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,356
This isn't an everyday thing. Jimmy,
you guys ready? Rocky, turn around here.

973
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:43,439
- Just don't take no cheap shots.
- No, I won't do that. Just relax.

974
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,758
Today we're here with heavyweight
challenger Rocky Balboa. The reason...

975
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,952
Hey, freak guy's stickin' his face in.

976
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,911
Let's try it again, Rocky.

977
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,712
<i>Today we're with heavyweight</i>
<i>challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>

978
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,149
<i>The reason we're in this refrigerated box...</i>

979
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,192
<i>... is that Mr Balboa has</i>
<i>an unusual method of training.</i>

980
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,835
<i>In a moment, he's going to</i>
<i>demonstrate that for viewers at home.</i>

981
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,714
<i>But first, Rocky,</i>
<i>how did you come to train in an icebox?</i>

982
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,116
<i>Uh, well, my friend,</i>
<i>the guy over there, he let me in one day.</i>

983
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,196
<i>I hit the beef and I kinda liked it.</i>

984
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,710
<i>Since I've become a challenger,</i>
<i>the owner don't mind neither.</i>

985
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,753
<i>Is this a common training method?</i>
<i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>

986
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,829
<i>- No, I think I invented it.</i>
<i>- Would you give us a demonstration?</i>

987
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,316
<i>(Apollo)</i> And be sure
to fly my barber to Philly.

988

How much is going to
West Coast advertising?

989
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,030
- $300,000.
- Make it 450.

990
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,196
Send the mayor's wife 200 roses...

991
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:44,118
...and make sure we get
a picture for the newspapers.

992
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,038
Do you want to run
15 radio spots in the Midwest?

993
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,720
You could spend better
in Canadian publicity.

994
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,789
Either way, I've got friends in Toronto
who could get you good tax breaks.

995
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,275
George, I like your friends.

996
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,908
Hey, champ, you oughta come and look
at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

997
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,191
- Looks like he means business.
- Yeah, I mean business too.

998
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:17,474
- Hey, Shirley, we got any more coffee?
- Certainly, Mr Creed. I'll get you some.

Don't be mad at him. He's tryin' to help.

1003
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:34,830
Adrian, I ain't mad. It's just that when
reporters are around, I get out of joint.

1004
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,838
They take cheap shots. Paulie knows that.

1005
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,997
Paulie keeps askin' me
for a job all the time...

1006

01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,952
Are you gonna say anything to him?

1008
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:50,834
What's to say?
I just don't know what he wants from me.

1009

He's no friend no more.
Get outta my house, I just said.

1014

- Don't talk to him like that.
- Both of ya, get outta my house!

You wanna hit on me? C'mon!

1019

I'll break both your arms,
so they don't work for ya!

1020
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,919
I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?
That's what I think of Gazzo!

1021
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:47,158
Now you're a big-shot fighter on your way
up, you don't even throw me a crumb!

1022

mornin'! I even give you my sister, too!

You can't live by yourself!

I put you two together, and you...
don't you ever forget it! You owe me!

- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?

1029
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,509
You're supposed to be good to me.

1030
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,030
What do I owe you, Paulie?
What do I owe ya?

1031
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:23,676
I treat you good. I cook for you, I clean
for you, I pick up your dirty clothes!

1032
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,759
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothin'!

1033
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:32,829
And you made me feel like
a loser! I'm not a loser!

1034
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,235
- You're busted!
- What?!

01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,079
Absolutely.

1040
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:29,309
OK, now when you walk into the ring
with the No.1 heavyweight of the world...

1041
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,749
...you'll be ready, won't ya? Why?

1042
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,953
Because I've waited
for 50 years to make ya ready.

1043
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,514
You'll be able to spit nails, kid.

1044
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:42,838
Like the guy says, you're gonna eat
lightning and you're gonna crap thunder!

1045
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,793
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

- Hey! Oh, Rock.

Al Salvani.

- Take a look at his eye, kid.
- How you doin', Al?

1049
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,793
- Not bad. I've seen worse.
- You ain't so bad yourself.

1050
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,593
- Cover up. Things'll be OK.
- <i>You</i> cover up.

1051
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:05,350
- Go and take a shower, will ya?
- OK, Mick. I'll see ya's tomorrow.

1052
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:09,234
- Hey, you covered that Whitmore fight.
- That's why he won.

1053
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,113
Listen, we got a winner here.
We got a chance.

1054
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,198
He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

1055
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:18,278
You just stand by for him.
We're gonna win.

1056
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,160
Hey, Rocky. It's OK I talk to ya?

1057
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,235
OK you talk to me? Sure.

1058
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,708
I figured an angle
to make money off your name.

1059
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,479
My name? How's that?

1060
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,353
Advertising. I know about that stuff.

1061
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,958
What do you know about advertising?
Huh?

1062
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:51,275
Hey, you can make money off my name,
make it, OK? I'm gonna take a shower.

It really don't matter if this guy
opens my head either.

1101
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,355
And if I can go that distance...

1102
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:42,756
...and that bell rings and I'm still standin'...

1103
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,069
...l'm gonna know for
the first time in my life, see...

1104
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,599
...that I weren't just another
bum from the neighbourhood.

1105
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,390
Time, kid. Let's go.

1106
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,355
I'll wait for you here.

1107
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:12,470
Well, how about I wait here and you fight,
you know?

1108
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,956
You're lookin' very great today.
You know that? Mm?

1109
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,478
I gotta go now,
but don't you leave town, huh?

1110
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,712
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

1111
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,717
Good luck.

1112
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:30,196
Say, Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, you know?

1113
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,232
- Good luck.
- Don't leave town.

1114
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,830
I'd like you to meet the man
working the fight with me, Stu Nahan.

1115
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,999
Thank you, Bill Baldwin. The electricity
is all over the place tonight...

1116
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,594
What the hell is that? I trained you
to be a fighter, not a billboard.

1117
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,473
- I'm doin' it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

1118
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,149
- Paulie gets three grand, I get the robe.
- Shrewd.

1119
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,999
On tonight's fight,
their difference in style...

1120
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:01,874
...a recent magazine said it could be
the caveman against the cavalier.

1121
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,437
The buzzing in the background could be
the challenger getting into the ring.

1122
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,351
- Rocky! Look at me! Ya cost me $200.
- Oh. I gotta go. I gotta work.

1123
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,675
- How's the robe?
- A little baggy.

1124
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,678
<i>(Bill)</i> A 50-1 underdog,
a Cinderella story...

1125
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,679
...and he's captured people's
imaginations all over the world.

1126
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,835
We love you, Rocky!

1127
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,554
- Yo, champ!
- Hey, thanks for showin' up.

1128
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:35,037
<i>(Stu)</i> His record: 44 victories -
38 by knockout. And he's lost 20 fights.

1129
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,594
<i>(Bill)</i> Which makes me wonder,
can he stand it?

1130
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:42,032
The stamina and the skill to last
the three rounds? Las Vegas odds say no.

1131
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,470
Rocky Balboa climbing into the ring now.

1132
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:50,435
The Italian Stallion. Some meat sign
on the back of his robe there. See that?

1133
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,710
"Shamrock Meat Company."

1134
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:56,913
<i>(Stu)</i> There's a lot of noise.
You could go deaf with that noise!

1135
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,235
Am I seeing right back there?

1136
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:02,397
Is that the world heavyweight champion,
Apollo Creed?

1137
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,479
<i>(Bill)</i> He's riding in a boat. Is he
supposed to be George Washington?

1138
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,239
Obviously so.
He's got the hat on. Look at that.

1139
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,114
<i>(Stu)</i> Well, it's been confirmed.
The world champion Apollo Creed...

1140
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:16,391
<i>... is</i> doing an imitation
of George Washington.

1141
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,152
He's throwing money.

1142
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:23,319
Remember when we talked about
George Washington throwing a dollar?

1143
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:28,036
Of course, throwing a dollar
in those days went a lot farther.

1144
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:31,118
The white wig came off,
the hat came off...

1145
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,508
I want all of you!

1146
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:39,760
And the crowd is loving every minute of it.
Here is the world heavyweight champion.

1147
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:44,192
<i>(Bill)</i> For you around the world,
he was dressed as George Washington.

1148
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,278
I want all of you! Come on, Stallion!

1149
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,279
- <i>(Stu)</i> Uncle Sam himself...
- I want all of you!

1150
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:58,315
- All of you! I want all of you!
- He looks like a big flag.

1151
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,829
I want you! You!

1152
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,511
- Is he talkin' to me?
- He is.

1153
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,756
- Is he talkin' to me?
- Let him talk.

1154
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,269
I want the Stallion! Come on!

1155
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,153
<i>(Bill)</i> He says "I want the Stallion!"

1156
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,993
In foreign countries during World War I
there was a picture of Uncle Sam...

1157
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,951
...with his finger pointed -

1158
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:22,358
...a recruiting poster for our fellows
in the army and the navy. "I want you!"

1159
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,436
<i>(Stu)</i> That's what he's doing a take on.

1160
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,358
- That's it. "Creed" he's yelling.
- "Creed in three."

1161
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,755
What do you think that outfit cost?

1162
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,030
<i>(fanfare)</i>

1163
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,150
<i>(bell)</i>

1164
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:42,473
Ladies and gentlemen...

1165
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:46,229
...good evening. A very happy new year.

1166
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,316
Welcome to Philadelphia.

1167
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:51,398
<i>(Stu)</i> Everybody who's anybody
is here tonight.

1168
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:59,513
Time does not permit me to introduce
the many luminaries of politics...

1169
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:03,792
...show business and the sporting world
who are with us tonight.

1170
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:09,269
But I would like to present
one of the immortals of pugilism...

1171
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,790
...a champion in and out of the ring.

1172
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,480
Philadelphia's own Smokin' Joe...

1173
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,592
...the beloved Mr Joe Frazier!

1174
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,280
<i>(cheering, whistling and applause)</i>

1175
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,949
Hi, how are you doing?
Don't hurt him, OK?

1176
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:35,197
<i>(Stu)</i> What a credit he's been
in his career as a fighter.

1177
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,436
He's coming over to talk with the champ.

1178
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:40,472
- Hey, Joe!
- You been dumpin' me long time.

1179
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,353
You next, Joe! You next, Joe!

1180
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,749
They must be friends.

1181
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,832
Joe Frazier!

1182
01:40:55,960 --> 01:41:00,431
Fight fans around the world, get settled
down, because it won't be long now.

1183
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,879
<i>(bell)</i>

1184
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,709
And now... for the main event!

1185
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,754
On my left, the challenger.

1186
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:16,958
In white trunks, weighing 190lb...

1187
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,833
...Philadelphia's favourite son...

1188
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:24,476
...the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa!

1189
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:27,160
<i>(cheering and some booing)</i>

1190
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,476
And on my right,
wearing red, white and blue...

1191
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,637
...weighing 210lb...

1192
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,032
...undefeated in 46 fights...

1193
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,954
...the Master of Disaster...

1194
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,516
...the undisputed
heavyweight champion of the world...

1195
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,509
...Apollo Creed!
<i>- (cheering)</i>

1196
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:55,029
I want you! I want you!

1197
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,835
You, chump! I want you!

1198
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:02,235
You've both fought in Philadelphia before.

1199
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:06,114
You know the rules. No low blows.
Watch your heads. No buttin'.

1200
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:11,189
- Shake hands now and come out fightin'.
- Put your hands up, chump. Come on!

1201
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:15,598
<i>(Bill)</i> A little body play goin' on there.
Rocky taking it carefully, though.

1202
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:19,349
He's just going over and being calm,
it looks like from here.

1203
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,914
There goes the big hat.

1204
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:28,313
<i>(Stu)</i> I've never seen a fighter
that concerned about his hair!

1205
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,037
And there's the bell for round one.

1206
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:43,358
The fighters come out into the centre
of the ring, looking at each other.

1207
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:48,235
Creed the champion zipping those
left-handed jabs, right in the head.

1208
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,511
The champ stinging
the slower challenger jabs at will.

1209
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:57,474
In fact, it looks like Rocky is
blocking the blows with his face.

1210
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,832
The champion doesn't look the best
he's ever been, but he's moving smoothly.

1211
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:05,748
Well, the champion is smiling now.
He's toying with his man.

1212
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:10,396
Tryin' to give the fans their money's
worth. He's makin' a show of it.

1213
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:13,876
And a very badly outclassed
challenger right now.

1214
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:18,110
<i>(Bill)</i> Creed trying to
make this man make...

1215
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:21,038
See? Make him miss like that.

1216
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:23,799
<i>(Stu)</i> Oh, the champ
is just taunting him now.

1217
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,075
Creed dancing around.

1218
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,389
I don't believe it! The champ is down!

1219
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:34,476
<i>(Bill)</i> Yes, he is!

1220
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,597
Creed is down! What a surprise this is!

1221
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:47,998
<i>(Stu)</i> This is the first time the champion
has ever been knocked down.

1222
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,709
Six! Seven! Eight!

1223
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,877
He appears to be all right.
Glancin' around...

1224
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:59,472
<i>(Mickey)</i> Come on, Rock! Go to the ribs!
Let's go to work right now, Rock!

1225
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:05,112
<i>(Bill)</i> Rocky comes back out. He's like
a bull in a china closet. He really wants it.

1226
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,754
Apollo, left to the head.

1227
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:12,158
<i>(Stu)</i> Now the champion's comin' back.
He's comin' off the floor now.

1228
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,518
<i>(Bill)</i> Another left, another right.
Combinations into the face. That's Apollo!

1229
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,756
Now the champ is taunting Rocky
to come and get some more.

1230
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,791
Left. Another.

1231
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,956
Another left!

1232
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,275
And Rocky's coming back now!

1233
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,793
Left! Right! Rocky's got him on the rope!

1234
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,710
OK, let's break it.

1235
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,549
There's no way they expected
this kind of hitting power.

1236
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:50,878
But the ability of the champion,
Apollo, is apparent.

1237
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:57,232
<i>(Stu)</i> Apollo unloading,
Rocky really tight against the ropes.

1238
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,316
<i>(bell)</i>

1239
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:08,317
They're leading him back over to his
corner. Rocky can hardly find his way.

1240
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:11,398
- I told ya! I told ya!
- Your nose is broke.

1241
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,715
- How does it look?
- It's an improvement.

1242
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,991
I want you to quit chuckin' and jivin'.
Stick and move.

1243
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,633
Go for the ribs.

1244
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:22,275
- Don't let that bastard breathe.
- The guy's great.

1245
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,870
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

1246
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,753
- Finish this bum and let's go home.
- Right.

1247
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,470
Stay to the body! To his right!

1248
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,956
<i>(Stu)</i> Here we go. Round two.
Creed predicted he would win in three.

1249
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:38,550
Creed got knocked down in the first.
He came back at the end.

1250
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,671
<i>(Bill)</i> Oh, he's working now.

1251
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,189
Oh, that sharp left! Again, a hard right.

1252
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:45,754
He's working Rocky into the corner again.

1253
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:47,836
He's got Rocky back in the corner.

1254
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:52,317
Pelting him left and right.
He's bouncing up against the ring.

1255
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,713
<i>(Stu)</i> Oh, Balboa's taking
a tremendous beating here.

1256
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,356
- <i>(Bill)</i> Battering him like a punching bag.
- <i>(Stu)</i> What's keeping him up?

1257
