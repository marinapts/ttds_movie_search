1
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,814
- What's your name again?
- Chrissy.

2
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,990
- Where are we goin'?
- Swimming.

3
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:38,998
Slow up. Slow down some.

4
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,627
I'm not drunk. Slow down.

5
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,047
Wait. I'm coming.

6
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,963
I'm coming.

7
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:52,053
I'm definitely coming.

8
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,470
Hold on.

9
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,647
I can swim.

10
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:09,447
I just can't walk or undress myself.

11
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,254
Come on in the water.

12
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,759
Take it easy. Take it easy.

13
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,223
Help me!

14
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,228
I'm coming. I'm coming.

15
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,358
It hurts!

16
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,605
Oh, my God!

17
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,617
Please help!

18
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:19,912
How come the sun didn't
use to shine in here?

19
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,909
We bought the house in the fall,
and this is summer.

20
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:32,999
Somebody feed the dogs.

21
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:35,047
Right.

22
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:40,473
Do you see the kids?

23
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,723
They must be in the backyard.

24
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,855
In Amity you say "yard."

25
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:56,441
They're in the "yard",
not too "far" from the "car."

26
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:01,651
- How's that?
- Like you're from New York.

27
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:06,617
Mom, I got cut. I got hit by a vampire.

28
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,200
You were playin' on those swings,
weren't you?

29
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:13,245
Those swings are dangerous.
Stay off there. I haven't fixed them yet.

30
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,965
I think you're gonna live.

31
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:17,755
- It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- Hello.

32
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,505
- Yes.
- Can I go swimmin'?

33
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:21,847
Let me clean this thing off first.

34
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:25,099
What do they usually do?
Wash up or float up? Or what?

35
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:32,602
Keep 'em there. I'll be out in about...

36
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:38,941
...15, 20 minutes. All right?
- Dry you off. Go on, get a Band-Aid.

37
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,986
Got to go. Missing person.

38
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,824
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.

39
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,203
Listen, Chief...

40
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:53,167
...be careful, will ya?
- In this town?

41
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:54,537
Hi, Dad.

42
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,875
Wait a minute. Let me get on.

43
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:59,969
- I want my cup back!
- You'll get it.

44
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,890
Wave goodbye. Bye.

45
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,830
Nobody saw her go into the water?

46
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,043
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.

47
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:42,757
- You mean, she ran out on you?
- No, sir.

48
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,808
She must've drowned.

49
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:49,801
Look, I reported it to you, didn't I?

50
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,352
- You live here?
- No. Hartford.

51
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,431
I go to Trinity. My folks live in Greenwich.

52
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:58,099
- Your folks were born here, right?
- I'm an Islander.

53
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,318
They moved off when my dad retired.

54
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:02,482
- You an Islander?
- No. New York City.

55
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:04,318
You here for the summer?

56
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:05,906
Come on.

57
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:20,045
Hold it.

58
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:34,135
Oh, Jesus.

59
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:02,749
You're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?

60
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:09,057
- Chief, what have you got on?
- Lf this new filing system is to work...

61
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:12,475
...you must keep that old stuff
off my desk. Just the pending.

62
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:15,728
Yes, Chief. We got a bunch
of calls about the Karate school.

63
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:19,148
It seems that the 9-year-olds
from the school have been...

64
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:21,767
...karate-ing the picket fences.

65
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,698
Chief Brody's office.
The Medical Inspector.

66
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:40,995
The Fire Chief wants you to go over...

67
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,293
I want a list of the water activities
that the city fathers...

68
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:45,927
...are planning for today.

69
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,126
Hendricks!

70
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:49,511
Where do we keep
the "Beach Closed" signs?

71
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:50,843
We never had any.

72
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:54,345
There's a truck with New Hampshire plates
in front of my store.

73
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:58,853
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.

74
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:24,212
Look what the kids did to my fence.
Eight and nine-year-olds...

75
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,008
- Glasses?
- Yeah, glasses.

76
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:30,053
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.

77
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:37,802
This stuff ain't gonna help me in August.

78
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:40,352
The summer ginks come
down here in June.

79
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:43,313
You haven't got one thing
on here I ordered.

80
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:47,394
Not a beach umbrella,
not a sun lounger, no beach balls.

81
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:49,655
If I can't get service...

82
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,615
Polly sent me to tell you
that there's a bunch...

83
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,459
...of Boy Scouts in Avril Bay,
doin' the mile swim for their Merit Badges.

84
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:06,121
I couldn't call them in,
there's no phones out there.

85
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,960
Come on, get out of there.

86
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:11,006
Take this stuff back to the office
and work on those signs.

87
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:14,430
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."

88
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,059
Let Polly do the printing.

89
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:19,429
- What's the matter with my printing?
- Let Polly do the printing.

90
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:21,439
Chief Brody!

91
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,277
What have you got there?

92
00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:29,197
We had a shark attack at South Beach
this morning, Mayor.

93
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,357
Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.

94
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,155
Albert, come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.

95
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,130
Charlie, take me out to those kids, will ya?

96
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,982
You're gonna shut down
the beaches on your own authority?

97
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:14,193
- What other authority do I need?
- You need a civic ordinance...

98
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:17,369
...or a resolution by the board.
- That's going by the book.

99
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:21,404
We're really a little anxious that you're
rushing into something serious here.

100
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,659
This is your first summer, you know.

101
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:25,295
What does that mean?

102
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:29,540
I'm only trying to say
that Amity is a summer town.

103
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,759
We need summer dollars.

104
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,467
If they can't swim here, they'll be glad
to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod...

105
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,182
...the Hamptons, Long Island.

106
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:40,425
That doesn't mean we serve
them a smorgasbord.

107
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,390
But we've never had
that kind of trouble in these waters.

108
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:47,149
What else could've done that?
A boat propeller?

109
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,022
I think possibly yes, a boating accident.

110
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,271
That's not what you told me
over the phone.

111
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:55,568
I was wrong.
We'll have to amend our reports.

112
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:58,448
- And you'll stand by that?
- I'll stand by that.

113
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:03,664
A summer girl goes swimming,
swims out a little far.

114
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:07,120
- She tires, fishing boat comes along...
- It's happened before.

115
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:10,747
I don't think you appreciate
the reaction people have to these things.

116
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,926
I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.

117
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:16,922
It's all psychological.

118
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:20,846
You yell "Barracuda!"
and everybody says, "What?"

119
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:24,437
You yell, "Shark!"...

120
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:29,066
...we've got a panic on our hands
on the Fourth of July.

121
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:33,353
Okay. You can take us back now.

122
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,617
I'm gonna get my raft
and go back out in the water.

123
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,456
Let me see your fingers.

124
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:55,837
- Alex Kintner, they're beginning to prune.
- Just let me go out a little longer.

125
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:58,384
- Just 10 more minutes.
- Thanks.

126
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:06,563
All I want to know...

127
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:10,396
I just want to know one simple thing:
When do I get to become an Islander?

128
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:12,560
Ellen, never. Never.

129
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:15,524
You're not born here,
you're not an Islander. That's it.

130
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:15,835
Don't bother him. Come right back.

131
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:20,967
I know you got
a lot of problems downtown...

132
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:24,305
...but I've got a couple of problems
I wish you'd take care of.

133
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:28,852
One, I've got some cats parking
in front of the house, I can't get...

134
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,433
What I need is a red zone.
It's simple, you could take care of it.

135
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,769
Would you come here a minute, please?

136
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:43,653
Are you okay?

137
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:45,780
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

138
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:49,075
Look, if the kids goin'
in the water is worrying you...

139
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:51,872
...they can play out here on the beach.

140
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:53,704
It's all right. Let them go.

141
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:04,718
It's cold.

142
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:10,894
We know all about you, Chief.
You don't go in the water at all, do you?

143
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,473
That's some bad hat, Harry.

144
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:21,313
Chief Brody, you are uptight.

145
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,536
Come on. That's it.

146
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:40,507
Tippet! Tippet!

147
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:12,157
Did you see that?

148
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:22,588
Blood!

149
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,675
Everybody out!

150
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:33,019
Get them out!

151
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,899
Michael, get out of the water!

152
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:55,829
Alex!

153
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:17,855
We don't even know
if there's a shark around here.

154
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:20,645
I can't argue with you. I can't talk to you.

155
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:24,609
I've got to talk to Mrs. Kintner.
This is turning into a contest.

156
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:28,445
It's not just the <i>Gazette</i>.
She's advertising in out of town papers.

157
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:32,700
I suggest we move to council chambers
where we'll have more room.

158
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:34,871
I'm responsible for public safety here.

159
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:37,744
Then go out tomorrow
and see that no one gets hurt.

160
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:40,832
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.

161
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,958
The ad is gonna run on the back
along with the grocery ads.

162
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,633
Right in here, please.

163
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:49,923
Move on in, please.

164
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:06,104
Why do you insist on playing the heavy?

165
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:10,029
I have a point of view and it speaks
for many of the people here.

166
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:16,786
Not only me, because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?

167
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,749
Let's have some order.

168
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,787
Let's have some order, please.

169
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:25,500
Any special questions?

170
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,085
Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark
in cash or check?

171
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:35,180
I don't think that's funny.
I don't think that's funny at all.

172
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:36,845
All right, all right.

173
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:41,513
That's private business between
you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.

174
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:45,482
Martin, would you please...

175
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:47,779
Chief Brody.

176
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:52,990
I just want to tell you
what we're planning so far.

177
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:54,820
What about the beaches, Chief?

178
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:58,779
We're gonna put on the extra
summer deputies as soon as possible.

179
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,334
And then we're gonna try
and use shark spotters on the beach.

180
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,089
Are you going to close the beaches?

181
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:09,968
Yes, we are.

182
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,130
We're also bringing in some experts
from the Oceanographic Institute.

183
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,179
Only 24 hours.

184
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:21,687
I didn't agree to that.

185
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:24,810
Only 24 hours.

186
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,194
24 hours is like three weeks.

187
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:55,094
You all know me. Know how I earn a livin'.

188
00:20:56,724 --> 00:21:00,804
I'll catch this bird for you.
It ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish.

189
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:05,727
Not like goin' down to the pond
and chasin' blue gills or tommy-cods.

190
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,440
This shark, swallow you whole.

191
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:14,824
Shakin', tenderizin'. Down you go.

192
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,446
And we got to do it quick.

193
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:21,700
Got to bring back the tourists that'll put
your businesses on a payin' basis.

194
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:25,081
But it's not gonna be pleasant.

195
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:28,373
I value my neck a lot more than $3,000.

196
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:33,842
I'll find him for $3,000,
but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.

197
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:36,588
You got to make up your minds.

198
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:38,971
Gonna stay alive and ante up...

199
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:42,391
...gonna play it cheap
and be on welfare the whole winter.

200
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:46,470
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.

201
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:49,103
There's too many captains on this island.

202
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:52,643
$10,000, for me, by myself.

203
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,610
For that, you get the head,
the tail, the whole damn thing.

204
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,989
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.

205
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:08,253
We'll take it under advisement.

206
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,258
Mr. Mayor, Chief...

207
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:17,886
...ladies and gentlemen.

208
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:53,704
Oh, God, you scared me.

209
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:01,551
People don't even know
how old sharks are.

210
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:05,057
If they live 2,000,
3,000 years they don't know.

211
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:08,722
Enough. You're not going to be able
to go to sleep tonight.

212
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:10,937
Here. Come on.

213
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:13,599
Thanks.

214
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,695
Want to get drunk and fool around?

215
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:26,362
Oh, yeah.

216
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:32,709
Mikey really loves his present.

217
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:35,210
Where is he?

218
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:37,122
Sitting in it.

219
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:41,127
Good God.

220
00:23:45,142 --> 00:23:47,384
All right, Michael, out of the boat.

221
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:51,349
Tied up to the jetties, sittin' in the boat.

222
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,392
I'm helpin' Michael.

223
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,359
- Get out of that boat.
- Hi, Dad.

224
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:57,318
Just a little longer. Please?

225
00:23:57,404 --> 00:24:00,322
- It's his birthday tomorrow.
- I don't want him on the ocean!

226
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:03,942
He's not on the ocean. He is in a boat.
He's not gonna go in the water.

227
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:08,413
I don't think he'll go in the water again,
after what happened yesterday.

228
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,334
Now don't say that.

229
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:14,784
I don't want that to happen,
you know that.

230
00:24:16,507 --> 00:24:19,294
I want him to read the boating regulations,
the rules...

231
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:21,543
...before he goes out on his own.

232
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:26,057
Michael, did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!

233
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:37,777
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.

234
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,365
The chief lives on the other side
of the island.

235
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,739
Am I comin' in straight?

236
00:24:45,703 --> 00:24:47,114
Just keep rowin'.

237
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:59,040
We better catch something,
this is my wife's holiday roast.

238
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,753
Don't worry about it.
$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.

239
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:14,055
Come and get it.

240
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:19,190
The tide's takin' it right out.

241
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:23,907
Can't we go home?

242
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:26,426
He's takin' it.

243
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:29,383
Go, go, go.

244
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:03,084
Charlie, take my word for it.
Don't look back. Swim, Charlie. Swim.

245
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:10,549
Come on, Charlie, swim to me!
Keep comin'.

246
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:18,481
- I can't get up.
- Give me your hand, Charlie.

247
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:24,273
- Help me!
- Get your feet out of the water!

248
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,541
Can we go home now?

249
00:27:48,552 --> 00:27:52,171
So then Denherder and Charlie
sat there tryin' to catch their breath...

250
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:56,677
...and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife
what happened to her freezer full of meat.

251
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:59,342
That's not funny. That's not funny at all.

252
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:02,143
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad
in <i>Field and Stream</i>.

253
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,605
Looks more like <i>The National Enquirer</i>.

254
00:28:06,112 --> 00:28:10,026
All right, hold it, hold it.
Hold everything. I said, hold it!

255
00:28:16,205 --> 00:28:19,788
- Hello.
- Hello, back, young feller. How are you?

256
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:23,870
Say, I hope you're not goin' out
with those nuts, are you?

257
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,959
The Weetock boat's gotta move out first.

258
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:32,923
You have to move out,
or he can't get out at all.

259
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:37,969
Don't raise sail, you're just gonna luff it.
You got a paddle on the boat?

260
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:41,062
Officer, wait a second. Wait a second.

261
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,355
How many guys are you gonna put
in that boat?

262
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:46,853
Whatever's safe, right?

263
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:50,278
- Yeah, well that ain't safe.
- Watch it, that's dynamite.

264
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:55,074
- Where are you goin' with that?
- I'm goin' on the boat.

265
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:58,405
- Help me get those guys out of the boat.
- Sure.

266
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:04,585
Gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you
that you're overloading that boat.

267
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,747
Go on, get out of here.

268
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:09,882
- You ain't going. What do you care?
- Can you tell me...

269
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:12,292
...if there's a good restaurant
or hotel here?

270
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:14,379
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.

271
00:29:15,306 --> 00:29:16,930
They're all gonna die.

272
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:21,053
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.

273
00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:23,303
You've got to get somebody to help us.

274
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:26,268
Yeah, get those road block signs
out on the highway.

275
00:29:26,358 --> 00:29:29,727
Because we've got more people
down here than we can handle.

276
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,857
What are you doing?
These are your people. Go talk to them.

277
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:34,740
They aren't mine. They're from all over.

278
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:38,775
You see the plates in the parking lot?
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey...

279
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:42,157
I'm all by myself out there.
What happened to the extra help?

280
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:44,621
That's not until the Fourth of July.

281
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,379
You know those guys
in that fan-tail launch out there?

282
00:29:47,463 --> 00:29:49,788
None of them will get
out of the harbor alive.

283
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:53,465
That's what I'm saying. You know
their names. Talk to those clowns.

284
00:29:53,552 --> 00:29:57,764
- Everyone seems to be having a good time.
- Tell me about it. I'll get back to you.

285
00:29:57,848 --> 00:30:00,386
Could you tell me
how I could find Chief Brody?

286
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:01,507
Who are you?

287
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:04,556
Matt Hooper.
I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.

288
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:08,224
For Christ sakes. You're the guy we called.
I'm Brody.

289
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:10,310
- I'm glad to meet you.
- Me, too.

290
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:13,238
I know you got a lot
on your hands right now, but...

291
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:16,773
The best thing for me to do is
to see the remains of the first victim.

292
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:18,278
The girl on the beach.

293
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:20,819
- Just bear with me, will ya?
- Sure.

294
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:25,326
Wait'll we get them silly bastards
down in that rock pile.

295
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,828
There'll be some fun.

296
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,671
They'll wish their fathers
had never met their mothers...

297
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:33,290
...when they start diggin' the bottoms out
and slammin' into them rocks.

298
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:36,136
Get away from there, you goddamn fool!

299
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:37,804
What's the matter with you?

300
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:40,296
You want to swamp us,
you crazy son of a bitch?

301
00:30:41,142 --> 00:30:43,300
What are these guys doin' out here?

302
00:30:44,353 --> 00:30:47,389
- What are they doin' back there?
- They're chummin' right now.

303
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,972
- What is that?
- They're tracking the shark now.

304
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:53,234
$3,000 divided four ways is what?

305
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:04,159
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

306
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:11,043
Victim identified as Christine Watkins,
female Caucasian.

307
00:31:11,255 --> 00:31:14,624
- And here's the way we have it.
- Probable boating accident.

308
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:25,634
The height and weight of the victim can
only be estimated from the partial remains.

309
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:33,105
The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.

310
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:36,360
There are no major organs remaining.
May I have a glass of water?

311
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:40,990
The right arm has been severed
above the elbow with massive tissue loss...

312
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:43,241
...in the upper musculature.

313
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:45,615
Thank you, very much.

314
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:51,459
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.

315
00:31:51,545 --> 00:31:56,254
- Did you notify the Coast Guard about this?
- No. It was only local jurisdiction.

316
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:05,013
The left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum
and portions of the rib cage are intact.

317
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:07,592
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.

318
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:11,020
This is what happens.

319
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:16,935
Indicates the non-frenzy feeding
of a large <i>squalus</i>, possibly <i>longimanus</i>...

320
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:18,946
...or <i>isurus glaucus</i>.

321
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,444
The amount of tissue loss
prevents any detailed analysis...

322
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:26,537
...however, the attacking <i>squalus</i>
must be larger...

323
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,161
...than any normal <i>squalus</i>
found in these waters.

324
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:32,539
Didn't you get a boat
and check these waters?

325
00:32:33,003 --> 00:32:35,043
This is not a boat accident.

326
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:39,206
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.

327
00:32:39,552 --> 00:32:41,544
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.

328
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:46,141
It was a shark.

329
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:05,825
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I wanna get on the state wire services.

330
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:08,071
See if Boston'll pick it up and go national.

331
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:11,330
Call Dave Axelrod in New York
and tell him he owes me a favor.

332
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:14,537
This is the shot I want
with everybody and the fish in it.

333
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:17,250
Guys, could we please get organized?

334
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,712
I want to get a picture for the paper.

335
00:33:20,843 --> 00:33:24,675
- Ben Gardner get this?
- No, no. We caught it.

336
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:29,843
- That's swell.
- It's a beauty, eh?

337
00:33:31,145 --> 00:33:34,181
I need a picture for the paper.
Clear out of the way, please.

338
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:37,191
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.

339
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:39,601
I want to get a picture
of the guy with the fish.

340
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:44,571
I need a picture for the paper.
Could we get the sign please?

341
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:56,628
Young fella,
could you step out of the picture?

342
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:00,924
We're ready.

343
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:05,011
- Can you get that, please.
- How's that?

344
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:13,226
Larry, you won't believe it.

345
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,981
- What kind of a shark is that?
- I don't know.

346
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,310
- I think it's a mako.
- It's got a deep throat, Frank.

347
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,605
- Yeah, but what kind? What kind of shark?
- Tiger shark.

348
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,353
A what?

349
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:26,944
We can start breathing again.

350
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:29,703
- Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?
- You bet he is.

351
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:31,993
What is this bite radius crap?

352
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:37,704
You stuff your friggin' head in there man,
and find out if it's a man-eater.

353
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:44,801
All I'm saying,
is that it may not be the shark.

354
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:49,213
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn, our Mayor.

355
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:53,132
- Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.
- Nice to meet you.

356
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:58,350
There are all kinds of sharks in the waters.

357
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,682
Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos...

358
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:03,611
And the chances that these bozos got
the exact shark...

359
00:35:03,696 --> 00:35:07,480
- There are no other sharks like this here.
- It's 100 to 1.

360
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:12,116
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.

361
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:15,330
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.

362
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:18,452
The fact is,
the bite radius on this animal is different...

363
00:35:18,544 --> 00:35:20,501
...than the wounds on the victim.

364
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:24,580
I want to be sure. You want to be sure.

365
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:27,925
We all want to be sure. Okay?
What I want to do is very simple.

366
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,847
The digestive system
of this animal is very, very slow.

367
00:35:30,931 --> 00:35:34,135
Let's cut it open.
Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours...

368
00:35:34,226 --> 00:35:37,476
...is bound to still be in there.
And then we'll be sure.

369
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:45,769
It may be the only way to confirm it.

370
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:48,188
Look, fellas let's be reasonable.

371
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:50,774
This is not the time or the place...

372
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:54,368
...to perform some kind
of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.

373
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:59,039
I am not going to stand here
and see that thing cut open...

374
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:02,875
...and see that little Kintner boy spill out
all over the dock.

375
00:36:27,363 --> 00:36:28,857
I just found out...

376
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:33,279
...that a girl got killed here last week.

377
00:36:34,954 --> 00:36:36,412
And you knew it.

378
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,781
You knew there was a shark out there.

379
00:36:42,253 --> 00:36:44,126
You knew it was dangerous.

380
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:47,418
But you let people go swimming anyway.

381
00:36:51,512 --> 00:36:53,421
You knew all those things...

382
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:59,432
...but still my boy is dead now.

383
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:06,390
And there's nothing you can do about it.

384
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:14,033
My boy is dead.

385
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:21,540
I wanted you to know that.

386
00:37:35,347 --> 00:37:37,423
I'm sorry, Martin. She's wrong.

387
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:40,768
No, she's not.

388
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,353
All right, fellas...

389
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:51,227
...let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down
before it stinks up the island.

390
00:37:51,322 --> 00:37:55,070
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow
and dump it in the drink.

391
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:08,220
Come here.

392
00:39:11,902 --> 00:39:13,183
Give us a kiss.

393
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:14,728
Why?

394
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:18,700
Because I need it.

395
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:24,664
Get out of here.

396
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:30,335
The door was open.
Mind if I come in? I'm Matt Hooper.

397
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:31,915
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.

398
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:35,042
Your husband's home?
I'd really like to talk to him.

399
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:36,671
Yes, so would I.

400
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:40,507
Can I get you some coffee?

401
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,224
Wine. How nice.

402
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:03,572
How was your day?

403
00:40:09,794 --> 00:40:10,873
Swell.

404
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,883
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.

405
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,343
That's nice.

406
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:21,386
Is anyone eating this?

407
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,515
My husband tells me you're in sharks.

408
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,900
Excuse me. Yes. I've never heard it
quite put that way. But yes, I am.

409
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:42,856
I love sharks.

410
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:45,240
- You love sharks?
- Yeah, I love them.

411
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:49,665
When I was 12 years old, my father got me
a boat, and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.

412
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,909
I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in...

413
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:54,920
...I hooked a four and a half foot
baby thresher shark...

414
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:57,165
...who proceeded to eat my boat.

415
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:01,300
He ate my oar, hooks,
and my seat cushions.

416
00:41:01,387 --> 00:41:04,590
He turned an inboard into an outboard.
Scared me to death...

417
00:41:04,682 --> 00:41:06,473
...and I swam back to shore.

418
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:08,136
When I was on the beach...

419
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:11,014
...I turned around and I saw my boat
being taken apart.

420
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:13,726
Ever since then,
I have been studying sharks...

421
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:17,066
...and that's why I'm gonna go
to the Institute tomorrow...

422
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:20,237
...and tell them that you still have
a shark problem here.

423
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:23,656
- Why do you have to tell them that?
- I'm sorry, I thought that...

424
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,534
You told me the shark was caught.

425
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,241
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.

426
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,786
They caught a shark, not the shark.

427
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,865
Not the shark that killed Chrissy Watkins.

428
00:41:34,003 --> 00:41:36,838
And probably not the shark
that killed the little boy.

429
00:41:36,922 --> 00:41:39,496
Which I wanted to prove
by cutting the shark open...

430
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:42,083
You may want to let that breathe...
Nothing.

431
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,147
You'll be the only rational man
left on this island after I leave tomorrow.

432
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:06,784
Where are you going?

433
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,864
I am going on the Aurora.

434
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:14,831
- The Aurora? What is that?
- It's a floating asylum for shark addicts.

435
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:16,911
Pure research. Eighteen months at sea.

436
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:20,207
Martin hates boats. Martin hates water.

437
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:24,716
Martin sits in his car when we go
on the ferry to the mainland.

438
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:29,053
I guess it's a childhood thing.
There's a clinical name for it, isn't there?

439
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:30,339
Drowning.

440
00:42:31,393 --> 00:42:35,640
Is it true that most people get attacked
by sharks in three feet of water...

441
00:42:35,773 --> 00:42:37,931
...about 10 feet from the beach?

442
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:42,689
And before people started
to swim for recreation...

443
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,781
...I mean before sharks knew
what they were missing...

444
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:48,701
...that a lot of these attacks
weren't reported?

445
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:51,407
That's right.

446
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:55,874
Now this shark that swims alone,
what's it called?

447
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,869
- Rogue.
- Rogue, yeah.

448
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:00,213
Now, this guy...

449
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:03,755
...he keeps swimmin' around in a place
where the feeding is good...

450
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:07,377
...until the food supply is gone. Right?
- That's called territoriality.

451
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:10,805
It's just a theory
that I happen to agree with.

452
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:17,641
Then why don't we have one more drink
and go down and cut that shark open?

453
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,234
Can you do that?

454
00:43:24,864 --> 00:43:27,533
I can do anything. I'm the Chief of Police.

455
00:43:34,123 --> 00:43:36,495
We start in the alimentary canal...

456
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:40,452
...open the digestive tract.

457
00:44:10,576 --> 00:44:13,067
- Just like I thought.
- What?

458
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:17,120
Came up from the Gulf Stream
from southern waters.

459
00:44:22,338 --> 00:44:24,247
He didn't eat a car, did he?

460
00:44:25,216 --> 00:44:27,837
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.

461
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:30,500
Somebody probably threw that in the river.

462
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:38,474
That's it.

463
00:44:40,606 --> 00:44:43,275
I've got to close the beach, call the Mayor.

464
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:46,608
You got a bigger problem than that.

465
00:44:46,946 --> 00:44:49,234
You still got a hell of a fish out there...

466
00:44:49,323 --> 00:44:51,363
...with a mouth about this big.

467
00:44:56,038 --> 00:44:58,197
How do we confirm that by morning?

468
00:44:58,874 --> 00:45:02,742
If he is a rogue, and there's any truth
to territoriality at all...

469
00:45:03,087 --> 00:45:06,207
...we could spot him
between Cape Scott and South Beach.

470
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:09,086
- Where're you going?
- To find him. He's a night feeder.

471
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:11,667
- On the water!
- We're not gonna find him on the land.

472
00:45:11,762 --> 00:45:13,470
I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.

473
00:45:13,556 --> 00:45:15,429
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

474
00:45:15,724 --> 00:45:17,384
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

475
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:29,652
I'm tellin' you,
the crime rate in New York'll kill ya.

476
00:45:30,406 --> 00:45:34,106
There's so many problems, you never feel
like you're accomplishing anything.

477
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,657
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.

478
00:45:37,288 --> 00:45:40,657
The kids can't leave the house.
You've got to walk them to school.

479
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:43,371
But in Amity,
one man can make a difference.

480
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,287
In 25 years, there's never been a shooting
or a murder in this town.

481
00:45:49,008 --> 00:45:51,677
No kidding? Want a pretzel?

482
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,632
Where are we?

483
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:56,722
We're right in the stretch
where he's been feeding.

484
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,058
Can you get the Late Show on this thing?

485
00:46:01,145 --> 00:46:05,356
No, it's a closed circuit TV system.
I have underwater cameras fore and aft.

486
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:09,270
Who pays for all this stuff?
The Government? The Institute?

487
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:11,401
This stuff cost a lot of money.

488
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:16,407
- I paid for this mostly myself, actually.
- You're kidding.

489
00:46:17,828 --> 00:46:19,287
- You rich?
- Yeah.

490
00:46:20,164 --> 00:46:21,492
How much?

491
00:46:21,582 --> 00:46:23,658
Personally or the whole family?

492
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:28,667
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?

493
00:46:30,716 --> 00:46:34,928
It doesn't make sense for a guy who hates
the water to live on an island, either.

494
00:46:35,012 --> 00:46:38,096
It's only an island
if you look at it from the water.

495
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:40,224
That makes a lot of sense.

496
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,933
What is that thing doing?

497
00:46:50,444 --> 00:46:51,855
It's a fish finder.

498
00:46:51,946 --> 00:46:56,157
It's probably just a school of mackerel
or something, all clumped together.

499
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,317
Wait a minute.

500
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,085
- There's somethin' else out there.
- What is it?

501
00:47:07,795 --> 00:47:10,416
About 100 yards, south, southwest.

502
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:47,788
- That's Ben Gardner's boat.
- You know him?

503
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:51,043
It's all banged up. Sure I know him.
He's a fisherman.

504
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,335
What happened?

505
00:48:01,056 --> 00:48:03,132
I got to go down there and check their hull.

506
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:05,218
Wait. Why don't we just tow it in?

507
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:07,980
We will. I just got to check something out.

508
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:09,813
Keep the lights going.

509
00:48:34,507 --> 00:48:35,835
Let's tow it in.

510
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:38,546
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's gonna happen.

511
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:45,883
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

512
00:48:45,976 --> 00:48:50,223
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Don't touch any of the equipment.

513
00:48:52,608 --> 00:48:54,517
I'll be back in two minutes.

514
00:50:22,156 --> 00:50:23,947
This is a great white. A big one.

515
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:27,865
Any shark expert in the world
will tell you it's a killer. It's a man-eater.

516
00:50:28,162 --> 00:50:32,325
A great white shark has staked a claim
in the waters off Amity Island.

517
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:35,583
He'll continue to feed here
as long as there's food in the water.

518
00:50:35,669 --> 00:50:38,706
There's no limit to what he'll do.
We've had three incidents.

519
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:41,004
Two people killed in a week.
It'll happen again.

520
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:43,084
It happened before, the Jersey beach, 1916.

521
00:50:43,177 --> 00:50:45,216
- Five people were killed...
- In one week.

522
00:50:45,304 --> 00:50:46,763
Tell him about the swimmers.

523
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:50,133
A shark is attracted to the exact kind
of splashing and activity...

524
00:50:50,226 --> 00:50:53,013
...that occurs whenever people swim.
You can't avoid it.

525
00:50:53,103 --> 00:50:55,345
If you open the beaches
on the Fourth of July...

526
00:50:55,439 --> 00:50:58,191
...it's like ringing the dinner bell,
for Christ sakes.

527
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,350
I pulled a tooth, the size of a shot glass,
out of a boat out there.

528
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:04,238
It was the tooth of a great white.

529
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:08,155
It was Gardner's boat all chewed up.
I helped tow it. You should've seen it.

530
00:51:08,244 --> 00:51:11,494
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?

531
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:12,785
I didn't see it.

532
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:15,543
- He dropped it on the way in.
- I had an accident.

533
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:18,419
And what did you say
the name of this shark is?

534
00:51:20,256 --> 00:51:23,043
It's a <i>carcharodon carcharias</i>.
It's a great white.

535
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:25,091
You don't have the tooth?

536
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:29,046
We depend on the summer people
for our lives...

537
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,425
You are not gonna have a summer
unless you deal with this problem.

538
00:51:32,518 --> 00:51:35,969
We have to close the beaches,
and hire somebody to kill the shark!

539
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,474
We have to tell the Coast Guard.

540
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:40,435
You'll have to contact
the Shark Research Panel.

541
00:51:40,818 --> 00:51:42,894
You'll have to ring this entire harbor.

542
00:51:42,987 --> 00:51:46,569
I don't think either one of you
are familiar with our problems.

543
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:49,905
I know that you are going to ignore...

544
00:51:49,994 --> 00:51:53,327
...this problem until it swims up
and bites you on the ass!

545
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:56,535
Wait a second.
There are two ways to deal with this.

546
00:51:56,625 --> 00:52:00,041
You're either gonna kill this animal,
or cut off it's food supply.

547
00:52:00,129 --> 00:52:01,920
We have to close the beaches.

548
00:52:03,883 --> 00:52:05,163
Sick vandalism.

549
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:09,377
That is a deliberate mutilation
of a public service message.

550
00:52:10,222 --> 00:52:12,892
I want those little paint-happy
bastards caught...

551
00:52:12,975 --> 00:52:16,142
...and hung up by their Buster-Browns.
- That's it. Goodbye.

552
00:52:16,228 --> 00:52:20,226
I won't waste my time arguing with a man
who's lining up to be a hot lunch.

553
00:52:20,316 --> 00:52:21,691
Don't do this.

554
00:52:29,325 --> 00:52:33,987
What we are dealing with here,
is a perfect engine, an eating machine.

555
00:52:34,955 --> 00:52:39,285
It's really a miracle of evolution.
All this machine does is swim...

556
00:52:39,585 --> 00:52:42,788
...and eat, and make little sharks.
And that's all.

557
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:46,500
Now, why don't you take a long,
close look at this sign.

558
00:52:46,592 --> 00:52:49,427
- Those proportions are correct.
- You'd love to prove that.

559
00:52:49,512 --> 00:52:52,050
Get your name
into the <i>National Geographic</i>.

560
00:53:04,276 --> 00:53:07,645
Larry, if we make an effort today,
we might be able to save August.

561
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,695
August? For Christ sake,
tomorrow's the Fourth of July.

562
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:13,575
And we will be open for business.

563
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:15,867
This will be the best summer
we've ever had.

564
00:53:15,955 --> 00:53:19,904
If you are concerned about the beaches
do what you have to, to make them safe.

565
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,836
But those beaches will be open
for this weekend.

566
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:48,183
I want to know how many men
you're going to send.

567
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:50,355
I don't need to come to Brisbane...

568
00:53:50,447 --> 00:53:52,736
...when I have a great white shark
right here.

569
00:53:53,284 --> 00:53:55,442
<i>We need men to patrol the swimming area. 

570
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:58,453
<i>We've got to have help. </i>
<i>Anybody with a gun or a boat. 

571
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:13,084
Monday!

572
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:19,100
Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?
He's the little guy with a crew cut.

573
00:54:36,202 --> 00:54:39,902
Operator, isn't there a phone on the island?
Could you connect me, please?

574
00:54:55,221 --> 00:54:57,344
Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?

575
00:54:58,974 --> 00:55:01,762
The guys from the TV station
on the mainland are here.

576
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:04,011
All right. I'll get to them later.

577
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:09,938
Brody to Scutbucket, please come in.

578
00:55:16,826 --> 00:55:18,533
Brody to Daisy, do you read me?

579
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:22,035
<i>Fascinating Rhythm, do you read me? </i>
<i>Come in, Hooper. What do you see? 

580
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:24,614
Nothing, here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.

581
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:28,957
Amity Island has long been known
for it's clean air, clear water...

582
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:31,331
...beautiful white sand beaches.

583
00:55:31,674 --> 00:55:32,919
But in recent days...

584
00:55:33,008 --> 00:55:36,627
...a cloud has appeared on the horizon
of this beautiful resort community.

585
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,472
A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.

586
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:12,537
- Hi, Larry.
- Why aren't you in the water?

587
00:56:13,966 --> 00:56:18,178
I just put some sun tan lotion on,
and I'm trying to absorb some...

588
00:56:18,304 --> 00:56:20,296
Nobody's going in.

589
00:56:21,098 --> 00:56:23,221
Please, get in the water.

590
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:26,407
Do me a favor, will you?

591
00:57:26,497 --> 00:57:30,329
You and the other guys take the boat
and put it in the pond instead.

592
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:32,537
The pond's for old ladies.

593
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:36,211
I know it's for the old ladies,
but just do it for the old man.

594
00:57:37,466 --> 00:57:40,088
- All right.
- Thanks.

595
00:57:52,731 --> 00:57:54,558
I've got Sean.

596
00:58:02,158 --> 00:58:03,616
Michael, wait!

597
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:06,447
Michael, I don't like you no more.

598
00:58:31,854 --> 00:58:33,930
Daisy, Daisy, this is Hendricks.

599
00:58:34,231 --> 00:58:36,224
Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over.

600
00:58:41,405 --> 00:58:43,979
False alarm. Must be this glare.

601
00:58:55,044 --> 00:58:58,128
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news
that we have...

602
00:58:58,214 --> 00:59:03,006
...caught and killed a large predator
that supposedly injured some bathers.

603
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:04,968
As you see, it's a beautiful day.

604
00:59:05,054 --> 00:59:08,304
The beaches are open,
and people are having a wonderful time.

605
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,964
"Amity," as you know, means "friendship."

606
00:59:22,571 --> 00:59:25,905
My God!

607
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,712
Jesus Christ! Fin! Shark! 350!

608
00:59:44,009 --> 00:59:46,927
<i>Martin, get them the hell out of the water. 

609
00:59:51,642 --> 00:59:53,433
No whistles! No whistles!

610
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:57,434
<i>Everybody please, get out of the water. </i>
<i>Everybody out of the water. 

611
01:01:03,923 --> 01:01:06,840
<i>Give an answer, please. </i>
<i>What's going on out there? 

612
01:01:10,846 --> 01:01:13,800
He made me do it. He talked me into it.

613
01:01:14,016 --> 01:01:18,263
Please, please, move back.
Please. Give these people some air.

614
01:01:20,356 --> 01:01:24,733
Martin it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.

615
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,988
Everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?

616
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:37,613
Shark! A shark!

617
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:43,037
- It's going into the pond! Shark in estuary!
- Now what?

618
01:01:43,963 --> 01:01:45,540
Michael's in the pond.

619
01:01:47,925 --> 01:01:50,879
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!

620
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:06,439
- Hurry up. Get that done.
- I can't do a damn thing.

621
01:02:12,783 --> 01:02:15,108
Haul in your sheet. Make it fast.

622
01:02:19,748 --> 01:02:21,706
You guys okay over there?

623
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:23,199
In the pond!

624
01:03:04,919 --> 01:03:08,619
Somebody get a gun and shoot it!
Doesn't anybody have a gun?

625
01:03:31,862 --> 01:03:35,065
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not. He's in shock.

626
01:04:06,313 --> 01:04:09,599
Doctor says he's okay. Mild shock.
He can go home in the morning.

627
01:04:12,403 --> 01:04:14,561
- How's my big kid?
- I'm all right.

628
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:17,276
You gonna miss me tonight?
You can watch television.

629
01:04:17,366 --> 01:04:19,939
- Want anything from home?
- My cars.

630
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:21,993
- What about ice cream?
- Coffee.

631
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:36,091
Want to take him home?

632
01:04:38,345 --> 01:04:39,888
Like to New York?

633
01:04:40,431 --> 01:04:42,305
No. Home, here.

634
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,567
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.

635
01:05:04,622 --> 01:05:06,246
You got a pen, Larry?

636
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:08,583
Yeah, pen, you know.

637
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:14,295
'Cause you're gonna do what you do best.

638
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:17,585
You're gonna sign this voucher
so I can hire a contractor.

639
01:05:17,676 --> 01:05:21,888
- I don't know if I can do that without...
- I'm gonna hire Quint to kill the shark.

640
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:24,384
- August?
- What?

641
01:05:25,351 --> 01:05:26,975
What are you talkin' about?

642
01:05:27,186 --> 01:05:29,344
Summer's over.
You're the Mayor of Shark City.

643
01:05:29,438 --> 01:05:31,894
These people think
you want the beaches open.

644
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:35,069
I was acting in the town's best interest.

645
01:05:35,152 --> 01:05:37,145
You were acting
in the town's best interest.

646
01:05:37,238 --> 01:05:39,277
That's why you're gonna do the right thing.

647
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:43,742
That's why you're gonna sign this, and
we're gonna pay that guy what he wants.

648
01:05:47,915 --> 01:05:50,536
My kids were on that beach, too.

649
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:02,667
Sign it, Larry.

650
01:06:12,606 --> 01:06:13,769
<i>$10,000.

651
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:17,227
<i>-$200 a day, whether I catch him or not. </i>
<i>-You've got it. 

652
01:06:17,611 --> 01:06:20,612
Get the Mayor off my back
so I don't have more zoning crap.

653
01:06:20,698 --> 01:06:22,026
You've got that.

654
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:25,740
One case of apricot brandy,
and you buy the lunch.

655
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:29,198
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.

656
01:06:29,623 --> 01:06:32,873
Champagne, <i>pâté de foie gras</i>,
Iranian caviar...

657
01:06:33,002 --> 01:06:35,208
...and don't forget the color TV.

658
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:42,045
You try this. Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.

659
01:06:42,136 --> 01:06:43,250
Thanks.

660
01:06:44,263 --> 01:06:46,801
Here's to swimmin'
with bow-legged women.

661
01:06:54,315 --> 01:06:55,725
Excuse me, Chief.

662
01:07:10,539 --> 01:07:13,326
Can't get a good man these days, under 60.

663
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:15,866
All gone at least 35 years.

664
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:17,372
Don't drink that.

665
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:24,843
You'll need an extra hand.

666
01:07:24,929 --> 01:07:26,506
- This is Matt Hooper.
- I know.

667
01:07:26,597 --> 01:07:28,720
- I've crewed three Trans Pacs.
- Transplants?

668
01:07:28,808 --> 01:07:32,307
- He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
- And an America's Cup trial.

669
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:36,523
Mr. Hooper, I'm not talkin'
about pleasure boatin' or day sailin'.

670
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:41,024
I'm talkin' about workin' for a living.
I'm talkin' about sharkin'.

671
01:07:41,195 --> 01:07:44,362
I'm not talkin' about hookin'
some poor dogfish or sand shark.

672
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:46,655
I'm talkin' about finding a great white.

673
01:07:46,742 --> 01:07:49,114
Porkers? Talkin' about porkers?

674
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,117
Just tie me a sheepshank.

675
01:07:58,963 --> 01:08:02,082
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship
in a long time.

676
01:08:03,133 --> 01:08:05,541
You didn't say how short you wanted it.

677
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:09,385
How's that?

678
01:08:12,935 --> 01:08:14,345
Gimme your hands.

679
01:08:16,188 --> 01:08:17,184
Dogfish?

680
01:08:17,648 --> 01:08:20,768
You got a $5,000 net
and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.

681
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:24,109
Along comes Mr. Whitey,
by the time he's finished with that net...

682
01:08:24,196 --> 01:08:28,064
...it looks like a kiddy's scissors class
has cut it up for a paper doll.

683
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:33,783
You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.
You been countin' money all your life.

684
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:37,658
I don't need this.
I don't need this working class hero crap.

685
01:08:37,751 --> 01:08:41,251
You're not gonna do this
aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?

686
01:08:43,006 --> 01:08:44,715
Maybe I should go alone.

687
01:08:48,011 --> 01:08:50,087
It's my party. It's my charter.

688
01:08:50,514 --> 01:08:53,634
Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party.
It's my vessel.

689
01:08:53,725 --> 01:08:55,553
You're on board my vessel...

690
01:08:55,644 --> 01:08:57,435
...l'm mate, master, pilot...

691
01:08:58,439 --> 01:08:59,933
...and I'm captain.

692
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,477
I'll take him for ballast, Chief.

693
01:09:08,157 --> 01:09:09,188
You got him.

694
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:17,872
Tail rope, eye splice, M-1, pliers, irons...

695
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:21,752
Sample bottles, dye marker,
flares, safety float...

696
01:09:21,837 --> 01:09:24,624
...temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...

697
01:09:24,715 --> 01:09:27,550
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?

698
01:09:36,685 --> 01:09:39,935
Take that stuff down below
and you lash it secure.

699
01:09:45,194 --> 01:09:46,818
Jesus H. Christ!

700
01:09:47,363 --> 01:09:52,154
When I was a boy, every squirt wanted
to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman.

701
01:09:53,327 --> 01:09:56,613
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?

702
01:09:56,705 --> 01:09:59,742
- An anti-shark cage.
- Anti-shark cage?

703
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:02,793
You go inside the cage?

704
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,588
Cage goes in the water?

705
01:10:06,924 --> 01:10:09,462
You go in the water? Shark's in the water.

706
01:10:10,803 --> 01:10:11,917
Our shark.

707
01:10:14,098 --> 01:10:18,345
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

708
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:23,018
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain

709
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:28,693
"For we've received orders
for to sail back to Boston

710
01:10:30,614 --> 01:10:34,778
"And so never more
shall we see you again"

711
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:44,116
- Did you take your Dramamine?
- Yes.

712
01:10:44,837 --> 01:10:48,170
I put an extra pair of glasses
in your black socks...

713
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:53,087
...and there's the stuff for your nose,
the zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit.

714
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:57,720
Goddamn women today,
they can't handle nothin'.

715
01:10:57,808 --> 01:11:01,307
Young girls just ain't quite smart
like their grandmothers were.

716
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:03,388
That's got to be Quint.

717
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:04,939
Colorful, isn't he?

718
01:11:05,024 --> 01:11:06,482
He scares me.

719
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:12,395
- Don't use the fireplace in the den.
- What am I gonna tell the kids?

720
01:11:16,076 --> 01:11:17,986
Tell them I'm going fishing.

721
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:26,327
Break it up, will ya, Chief?
Daylight's wastin'.

722
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:30,875
Front: bow. Back: stern.

723
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:33,009
Better get it right, squirt...

724
01:11:33,093 --> 01:11:36,676
...or I throw your ass out
the little round window on the side.

725
01:11:37,014 --> 01:11:39,303
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.

726
01:11:39,892 --> 01:11:41,719
See you got your rubbers.

727
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:48,607
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee,
Died at the age of 103

728
01:11:48,984 --> 01:11:53,895
"For 15 years she kept her virginity,
Not a bad record for this vicinity"

729
01:11:54,615 --> 01:11:57,901
All right, Commissioner,
fasten your safety belt.

730
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,372
If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow.

731
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:09,335
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.

732
01:12:18,556 --> 01:12:20,264
How's the Missus, Chief?

733
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:24,933
If they don't like you goin' out,
they'll love you comin' in.

734
01:12:50,754 --> 01:12:53,958
Keep that chum line goin'.
We got five good miles on it.

735
01:12:56,177 --> 01:12:59,131
- Who's driving this boat?
- Nobody. The tide.

736
01:13:00,431 --> 01:13:04,381
One time, I caught a 16-footer off Montauk.
Had to stick two barrels in him.

737
01:13:04,476 --> 01:13:06,849
Two to wear him down and bring him up.

738
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:10,227
Nowadays, these kids,
they take out everything.

739
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:14,016
Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes.

740
01:13:17,156 --> 01:13:18,531
Jesus H. Christ.

741
01:13:20,075 --> 01:13:22,863
Best drop another chum marker.

742
01:13:45,226 --> 01:13:46,768
Damn it, Martin!

743
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:49,311
This is compressed air.

744
01:13:49,396 --> 01:13:52,896
- What the hell kind of a knot was that?
- You pulled the wrong one.

745
01:13:52,983 --> 01:13:56,187
You screw around with these tanks,
and they're gonna blow up.

746
01:13:56,278 --> 01:13:59,861
Yeah, that's real fine,
expensive gear you've brought out here.

747
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:03,779
I don't know what
that bastard shark's gonna do with it.

748
01:14:03,869 --> 01:14:07,784
Might eat it, I suppose.
Seen one eat a rockin' chair one time.

749
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:15,045
Next time,
you just ask me which line to pull, right?

750
01:14:21,345 --> 01:14:23,883
Little brown eel comes out of the cave...

751
01:14:24,765 --> 01:14:26,509
...swims into the hole...

752
01:14:27,977 --> 01:14:30,978
...comes out of the hole,
back into the cave again.

753
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:34,183
It's not too good, is it?

754
01:14:34,984 --> 01:14:37,819
Nothin's easy, is it? One more time.

755
01:15:58,817 --> 01:15:59,932
I got it.

756
01:16:01,612 --> 01:16:03,651
- What?
- Get behind me.

757
01:16:07,076 --> 01:16:08,819
Hooper, reverse her!

758
01:16:09,662 --> 01:16:11,701
Takin' a hell of a lot of line.

759
01:16:12,122 --> 01:16:14,910
Get the scoop out of the bucket.
Wet the reel.

760
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:21,797
Reverse her!

761
01:16:24,552 --> 01:16:27,885
Duck your head down.
We're swingin'. Get behind me again.

762
01:16:28,556 --> 01:16:31,426
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.

763
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:35,475
Hooper, you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watchin' it!

764
01:16:39,483 --> 01:16:41,108
Hooper, neutral.

765
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:49,742
Where'd he go now?

766
01:16:50,995 --> 01:16:52,537
He ain't foolin' me.

767
01:16:53,706 --> 01:16:55,449
What's he yankin' on now?

768
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:58,078
Go on, try it.

769
01:17:10,848 --> 01:17:13,884
I don't know, Chief,
if he's very smart or very dumb.

770
01:17:20,941 --> 01:17:22,056
Jesus...

771
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:27,280
He's gone under.

772
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:30,858
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.

773
01:17:32,077 --> 01:17:33,620
Yeah, it's too easy.

774
01:17:33,746 --> 01:17:36,949
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.

775
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,750
Keep her steady, now.
I got somethin' very big.

776
01:17:40,961 --> 01:17:42,372
I don't think so.

777
01:17:43,547 --> 01:17:45,504
Chief, put your gloves on.

778
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,542
You put your gloves on, both of you.

779
01:17:51,347 --> 01:17:53,386
Getting ready to run out again.

780
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:55,801
Quint, let it go.

781
01:17:56,894 --> 01:17:59,764
You may be big in the lab,
but out here you're just cargo.

782
01:17:59,855 --> 01:18:02,726
If you don't want to backstroke home,
you get down here.

783
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:05,770
You don't want to listen to me,
don't listen to me.

784
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:09,195
- It's not a shark.
- The wire's showing!

785
01:18:09,281 --> 01:18:10,526
Unbuckle me.

786
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:15,110
- Get the other side.
- It's a tuna or swordfish.

787
01:18:17,998 --> 01:18:19,327
Take this rod.

788
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:22,825
- Give the Chief a hand, will you?
- Right!

789
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:36,219
It's a marlin or a stingray...

790
01:18:37,017 --> 01:18:39,224
...but it's definitely a game fish.

791
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:52,614
Gamin' fish?

792
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:56,111
Marlin, stingray bit
through this piano wire?

793
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:58,451
Don't you tell me my business again.

794
01:18:58,539 --> 01:19:02,157
- You get back on the bridge.
- Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.

795
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:03,793
It proves one thing.

796
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:07,620
It proves that you wealthy college boys
don't have the education enough...

797
01:19:07,715 --> 01:19:09,506
...to admit when you're wrong.

798
01:19:18,851 --> 01:19:21,520
What's the point? Hooks and lines?

799
01:19:24,064 --> 01:19:26,520
You lose one, you rig one.

800
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,693
Twelve minutes, south, southeast, now.
Full throttle.

801
01:19:33,782 --> 01:19:35,277
Aye, aye, sir.

802
01:19:37,369 --> 01:19:40,655
You see, what I do, Chief,
is I trick 'em to the surface.

803
01:19:41,081 --> 01:19:42,624
And then jab at 'em.

804
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:46,452
I'm not gonna haul 'em up
like a lot of catfish.

805
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:48,500
Full throttle.

806
01:19:48,589 --> 01:19:51,210
I don't have to take this abuse
much longer.

807
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,385
Your head's bleeding. First aid there.

808
01:20:23,082 --> 01:20:25,288
Start that chum line again, will ya?

809
01:20:28,087 --> 01:20:29,795
Let Hooper take a turn.

810
01:20:30,089 --> 01:20:32,461
Hooper drives the boat.

811
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:49,771
Stop playin' with yourself, Hooper.

812
01:20:49,859 --> 01:20:51,732
Slow ahead, if you please.

813
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,396
You heard him. Slow ahead.

814
01:21:03,497 --> 01:21:04,742
Slow ahead.

815
01:21:05,166 --> 01:21:09,377
I can go slow ahead. Come on down
and chum some of this shit.

816
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,596
You're gonna need a bigger boat.

817
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:45,781
Shut off that engine.

818
01:22:13,651 --> 01:22:16,320
- That's a 20-footer.
- 25.

819
01:22:17,363 --> 01:22:18,821
Three tons of him.

820
01:22:24,328 --> 01:22:26,700
We're gonna need a bigger boat, right?

821
01:22:26,997 --> 01:22:28,456
Gotta get to work.

822
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:30,290
How do we handle this?

823
01:22:31,085 --> 01:22:33,291
Come up front, Martin. I need you.

824
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:36,838
He's circling the boat.

825
01:22:50,271 --> 01:22:54,055
<i>Amity Point Light Station to Orca. </i>
<i>This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca. 

826
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:55,348
<i>Come in, Orca. 

827
01:22:56,318 --> 01:22:59,770
- Orca. Come in.
- <i>I have Mrs. Martin Brody here. 

828
01:22:59,947 --> 01:23:01,062
Put her on.

829
01:23:01,907 --> 01:23:04,825
- Come on, Martin! Move!
- I'm not goin' out there!

830
01:23:04,994 --> 01:23:09,620
Beyond the edge of the barrels.
Go to the end of the barrels, further out.

831
01:23:09,915 --> 01:23:11,113
- Further out.
- Why?

832
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,702
- Go further out.
- What for?

833
01:23:12,793 --> 01:23:14,702
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

834
01:23:14,795 --> 01:23:17,037
- What?
- Will you go to the end of the pulpit?

835
01:23:17,131 --> 01:23:20,085
I need something
in the foreground to give it some scale.

836
01:23:20,176 --> 01:23:21,290
Foreground my ass!

837
01:23:21,385 --> 01:23:24,552
Your husband's okay. He's fishin'.
He just caught some stripers.

838
01:23:24,638 --> 01:23:26,631
We'll bring 'em for dinner.
We won't be long.

839
01:23:26,724 --> 01:23:28,633
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.

840
01:23:28,851 --> 01:23:31,093
- I'm not staying here!
- I'm begging you!

841
01:23:31,187 --> 01:23:32,515
Goddamn it!

842
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,973
Come here, come here, darlin'.

843
01:23:40,613 --> 01:23:43,448
I want you up on the bridge,
just take her forward, steady.

844
01:23:43,532 --> 01:23:47,779
- I've never steered a boat in my life.
- Just watch my hand, take her steady.

845
01:23:48,454 --> 01:23:51,159
Attach the end of this line to the first keg.

846
01:23:52,124 --> 01:23:55,042
I've got to get a good shot
at that porker's head.

847
01:24:14,063 --> 01:24:15,640
Get clear of the bow.

848
01:24:20,236 --> 01:24:22,857
- Hurry up, will ya?
- Your turn, Quint.

849
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:25,108
Hooper, where are you?

850
01:24:29,036 --> 01:24:30,863
Hurry it up now, tie it on.

851
01:24:32,331 --> 01:24:34,739
He's comin' straight for us!
Don't screw up now.

852
01:24:34,834 --> 01:24:36,292
Don't wait for me.

853
01:24:38,879 --> 01:24:41,880
Come on, Hooper. Come on.
Hurry it up. Tie it on.

854
01:24:42,716 --> 01:24:44,045
Now. Now.

855
01:24:47,888 --> 01:24:49,133
Kill it!

856
01:24:50,266 --> 01:24:51,096
Now!

857
01:24:53,227 --> 01:24:54,342
Shoot!

858
01:24:57,648 --> 01:24:58,644
Time.

859
01:25:00,484 --> 01:25:04,564
What were you doin', anyway?
I didn't get a clean shot right in the head.

860
01:25:05,114 --> 01:25:08,198
Let's see how long that barrel takes
to bring him up.

861
01:25:09,743 --> 01:25:12,947
Free another barrel.
I'm comin' around again.

862
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,710
What do we do now? We're quittin', right?

863
01:26:08,802 --> 01:26:12,800
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.

864
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,299
We could radio in and get a bigger boat...

865
01:26:40,918 --> 01:26:43,076
Don't you worry about it, Chief.

866
01:26:43,963 --> 01:26:45,587
It won't be permanent.

867
01:26:45,756 --> 01:26:47,998
You want to see something permanent?

868
01:26:54,473 --> 01:26:57,260
You want to feel somethin' permanent?

869
01:26:58,477 --> 01:27:02,095
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?

870
01:27:02,565 --> 01:27:05,482
Knocko Nolans, St. Paddy's Day, Boston.

871
01:27:10,072 --> 01:27:11,483
I got that beat.

872
01:27:19,665 --> 01:27:21,076
It's a moray eel.

873
01:27:21,959 --> 01:27:24,117
It bit right through my wet suit.

874
01:27:26,088 --> 01:27:29,338
I don't know about that,
but I entered an arm wrestlin' contest...

875
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:31,963
...in an Oakie bar in San Francisco.
See this?

876
01:27:32,052 --> 01:27:34,259
I can't extend that. You know why?

877
01:27:34,513 --> 01:27:36,340
'Cause in the semi-final...

878
01:27:36,682 --> 01:27:38,924
...celebrating my third wife's demise...

879
01:27:39,018 --> 01:27:42,137
...big Chinese fella, he pulled me right over.

880
01:27:54,491 --> 01:27:55,690
Look at that.

881
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,162
That's a bull shark.

882
01:27:59,538 --> 01:28:02,029
He scraped me when I was takin' samples.

883
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:04,791
I got something for you.

884
01:28:05,586 --> 01:28:08,670
There's a thresher.
You see that? A thresher's tail.

885
01:28:09,298 --> 01:28:11,125
- Thresher?
- It's a shark.

886
01:28:14,136 --> 01:28:17,256
- You want a drink? Drink to your leg?
- I'll drink to your leg.

887
01:28:17,348 --> 01:28:19,506
So we drink to our legs.

888
01:28:24,813 --> 01:28:27,814
I got the <i>crème de la crème</i>.
Right here. Hold on.

889
01:28:29,193 --> 01:28:30,687
Here, you see that?

890
01:28:31,237 --> 01:28:32,980
You're wearin' a sweater.

891
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:35,815
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.

892
01:28:37,368 --> 01:28:38,826
She broke my heart.

893
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:50,755
What's that one?

894
01:28:50,965 --> 01:28:53,752
- What?
- That one, there. On your arm.

895
01:28:56,595 --> 01:28:58,588
A tattoo. I got that removed.

896
01:28:59,306 --> 01:29:02,141
Don't tell me. Don't tell me, "Mother."

897
01:29:07,815 --> 01:29:09,143
What is it?

898
01:29:14,405 --> 01:29:16,528
That's the U.S.S. Indianapolis.

899
01:29:24,874 --> 01:29:26,831
You were on the Indianapolis?

900
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:28,281
What happened?

901
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:34,382
Japanese submarine slammed
two torpedoes into her side, Chief.

902
01:29:35,759 --> 01:29:39,093
I was comin' back
from the island of Tinian to Leyte...

903
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:42,299
...just delivered the bomb,
the Hiroshima bomb.

904
01:29:45,811 --> 01:29:48,219
1,100 men went into the water.

905
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,557
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.

906
01:29:52,985 --> 01:29:55,902
Didn't see the first shark
for about half an hour.

907
01:29:56,113 --> 01:29:57,904
Tiger, 13-footer.

908
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:00,907
Know how you know that
when you're in the water?

909
01:30:00,993 --> 01:30:03,828
You tell by lookin'
from the dorsal to the tail.

910
01:30:05,998 --> 01:30:07,623
Well, we didn't know.

911
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:10,955
Because our bomb mission
had been so secret...

912
01:30:12,046 --> 01:30:14,501
...no distress signal had been sent.

913
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,801
They didn't even list us overdue
for a week.

914
01:30:25,601 --> 01:30:28,768
Very first light, sharks come cruisin'...

915
01:30:29,605 --> 01:30:32,226
...so we formed ourselves
into tight groups.

916
01:30:34,401 --> 01:30:37,735
Kinda like old squares in a battle
like you see on a calendar...

917
01:30:37,821 --> 01:30:39,481
...like the Battle of Waterloo.

918
01:30:39,573 --> 01:30:42,243
The idea was,
the shark comes to the nearest man...

919
01:30:42,326 --> 01:30:45,197
...and he starts poundin'
hollerin' and screamin'.

920
01:30:45,287 --> 01:30:47,280
Sometimes the shark would go away...

921
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:51,117
...but sometimes he wouldn't go away.

922
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:53,997
Sometimes that shark,
he looks right into you...

923
01:30:54,088 --> 01:30:55,796
...right into your eyes.

924
01:30:56,882 --> 01:30:59,504
You know, a thing about a shark, he's got...

925
01:30:59,844 --> 01:31:01,254
...lifeless eyes.

926
01:31:01,637 --> 01:31:04,009
Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

927
01:31:05,599 --> 01:31:08,719
When he comes at you,
he doesn't seem to be livin'...

928
01:31:09,228 --> 01:31:10,888
...until he bites you.

929
01:31:11,146 --> 01:31:14,147
Those little black eyes
roll over white and then...

930
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:19,276
...then you hear
that terrible high-pitched screamin'.

931
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,405
The ocean turns red...

932
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:25,734
...in spite of the poundin' and the hollerin',
they all come in.

933
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,288
They rip you to pieces.

934
01:31:34,128 --> 01:31:36,701
You know, by the end of that first dawn...

935
01:31:38,382 --> 01:31:39,876
...we lost 100 men.

936
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:43,835
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.

937
01:31:43,929 --> 01:31:47,014
I don't know how many men,
they averaged six an hour.

938
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:50,555
On Thursday mornin',
I bumped into a friend of mine...

939
01:31:50,644 --> 01:31:52,803
...Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.

940
01:31:54,356 --> 01:31:56,812
Baseball player, Bosun's mate.

941
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,028
I thought he was asleep.

942
01:32:01,822 --> 01:32:03,731
Reached over to wake him up.

943
01:32:04,825 --> 01:32:08,324
He bobbed up and down
in the water just like a kind of top.

944
01:32:09,288 --> 01:32:10,486
Upended.

945
01:32:14,668 --> 01:32:17,373
He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.

946
01:32:21,217 --> 01:32:25,214
Noon the fifth day,
a Lockheed Ventura saw us.

947
01:32:25,304 --> 01:32:28,139
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.

948
01:32:28,224 --> 01:32:30,181
Younger than Mr. Hooper. He saw us...

949
01:32:30,267 --> 01:32:32,592
...and he came in low,
and three hours later...

950
01:32:32,686 --> 01:32:35,972
...a big fat PBY comes down
and starts to pick us up.

951
01:32:36,273 --> 01:32:39,227
That was the time I was most frightened.

952
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,604
Waitin' for my turn.

953
01:32:42,988 --> 01:32:45,360
I'll never put on a life jacket again.

954
01:32:47,785 --> 01:32:50,027
So, 1,100 men went into the water...

955
01:32:50,788 --> 01:32:52,496
...316 men come out.

956
01:32:52,581 --> 01:32:56,413
The sharks took the rest
June the 29th, 1945.

957
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:03,248
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

958
01:33:15,646 --> 01:33:16,809
What's that?

959
01:33:17,857 --> 01:33:19,137
It's a whale.

960
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:25,523
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

961
01:33:27,408 --> 01:33:32,117
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain"

962
01:33:36,834 --> 01:33:40,701
"Show me the way to go home

963
01:33:42,131 --> 01:33:46,259
"I'm tired and I want to go to bed

964
01:33:47,678 --> 01:33:52,340
"I had a little drink about an hour ago

965
01:33:52,808 --> 01:33:56,888
"And it's gone right to my head

966
01:33:58,063 --> 01:34:02,061
"Wherever I may roam

967
01:34:03,068 --> 01:34:07,113
"By land, or sea, or foam

968
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:21,161
"Show me the way to go home

969
01:34:21,587 --> 01:34:24,671
"I'm tired and I want to go to bed

970
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:27,372
"I had a little drink about a hour ago

971
01:34:27,468 --> 01:34:29,923
"And it's gone right to my head

972
01:34:30,012 --> 01:34:32,301
"Wherever I may roam

973
01:34:32,723 --> 01:34:35,012
"On land or sea or foam

974
01:34:35,142 --> 01:34:38,476
"You can always hear me singing this..."

975
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:43,233
Start the engines.

976
01:34:53,244 --> 01:34:54,442
Fire her up!

977
01:35:03,128 --> 01:35:04,920
Put out the fire, will ya?

978
01:35:14,598 --> 01:35:16,258
- Pump her out.
- Done.

979
01:35:25,025 --> 01:35:27,398
- Everybody on deck.
- He ate the light.

980
01:35:27,486 --> 01:35:29,064
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.

981
01:35:31,615 --> 01:35:34,569
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.

982
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,828
What's wrong with this?

983
01:35:40,207 --> 01:35:44,039
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.

984
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:03,099
You okay?

985
01:36:05,191 --> 01:36:06,222
You okay?

986
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:32,961
More left rudder.

987
01:36:33,844 --> 01:36:35,338
Pull your left hand down.

988
01:36:35,429 --> 01:36:38,347
I can't. It'll only go about three inches.

989
01:36:38,474 --> 01:36:42,258
All of our injectors got scored
from the salt water in the fuel.

990
01:36:43,354 --> 01:36:45,927
Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it.

991
01:36:46,774 --> 01:36:51,234
Try the left rudder again. More left.
Good. Once again now.

992
01:36:55,324 --> 01:36:56,522
There it is.

993
01:36:56,867 --> 01:36:58,575
What do you say, Chief?

994
01:36:58,786 --> 01:37:01,359
The barrel is up, it's right in the stern.

995
01:37:05,167 --> 01:37:08,583
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.

996
01:37:20,975 --> 01:37:22,967
If we can get close enough...

997
01:37:23,978 --> 01:37:28,687
...l've got things on board that'll kill it.
- Just want to goose him up. Come on.

998
01:37:40,494 --> 01:37:43,946
When he runs, you drop that rope
or you'll lose your hands.

999
01:37:45,624 --> 01:37:49,871
I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles.
Whole sea's bones, full of 'em.

1000
01:37:50,296 --> 01:37:52,004
Give it to me a minute.

1001
01:38:07,396 --> 01:38:09,887
Haul in that line or it'll foul us.

1002
01:38:10,774 --> 01:38:12,233
Start the engine.

1003
01:38:14,236 --> 01:38:17,439
- Where are you goin'?
- I'm gonna make a phone call.

1004
01:38:24,163 --> 01:38:26,618
Hello, mayday, Orca. Coast Guard?

1005
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:30,164
Coast Guard, this is the Orca.
Do you read me?

1006
01:38:30,252 --> 01:38:32,743
Coast Guard, this is the Orca. Do you...

1007
01:38:38,844 --> 01:38:40,386
Excuse me, Chief.

1008
01:38:40,971 --> 01:38:45,514
That's great. That's just great.
Now, where the hell are we?

1009
01:38:47,603 --> 01:38:51,387
You're certifiable, Quint.
You know that? You're certifiable.

1010
01:38:51,524 --> 01:38:54,643
- You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this!
- Boys.

1011
01:38:56,487 --> 01:38:59,322
I think he's come back for his noon feeding.

1012
01:39:00,491 --> 01:39:02,234
Hook me up another barrel.

1013
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:34,767
Bring her around after him.

1014
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:54,033
Full throttle.
Get me right up alongside of him.

1015
01:39:54,128 --> 01:39:57,413
I can't rev it up that high,
it's not gonna take it.

1016
01:40:15,357 --> 01:40:16,935
Five degrees port.

1017
01:40:23,949 --> 01:40:25,858
All right, hold your course.

1018
01:40:32,082 --> 01:40:34,040
Five degrees port now.

1019
01:40:37,546 --> 01:40:38,957
Hold your course.

1020
01:40:40,799 --> 01:40:42,626
- Fast fish.
- Watch my hand.

1021
01:40:44,178 --> 01:40:47,594
Be sure you watch my hand.
Follow me. Follow me.

1022
01:40:48,974 --> 01:40:51,761
Lad, you watch him now.
Starboard. Starboard.

1023
01:40:52,937 --> 01:40:54,182
Run him down.

1024
01:41:02,029 --> 01:41:03,357
Hard apart.

1025
01:41:06,951 --> 01:41:07,946
Watch him.

1026
01:41:08,035 --> 01:41:09,198
Starboard.

1027
01:41:33,644 --> 01:41:36,977
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.

1028
01:41:42,444 --> 01:41:43,855
It's incredible.

1029
01:41:50,119 --> 01:41:52,028
- They're up again!
- Now what?

1030
01:42:01,088 --> 01:42:05,335
Why don't we lead the shark into shore
instead of him leading us out to sea?

1031
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:11,638
Grab a couple of poles.

1032
01:42:13,934 --> 01:42:16,057
Hang on now, we're going around.

1033
01:42:16,729 --> 01:42:19,220
Into starboard. Easy.

1034
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:23,809
I'm gonna back her off now.
Keep a watch on it, boys. Watch him.

1035
01:42:28,824 --> 01:42:30,864
All right, gentlemen, snag them.

1036
01:42:36,373 --> 01:42:38,911
Now then tie them to the stern cleats.

1037
01:42:41,921 --> 01:42:44,542
Brody, bring your end around the cleat.

1038
01:42:45,299 --> 01:42:48,750
That's right, it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.

1039
01:42:50,638 --> 01:42:52,346
Stay clear of the line.

1040
01:43:00,481 --> 01:43:02,189
Watch it. Stand clear.

1041
01:43:12,243 --> 01:43:14,912
Stand away from those stern cleats.

1042
01:43:27,967 --> 01:43:29,959
Back home we got a taxidermy man.

1043
01:43:30,052 --> 01:43:33,386
He gonna have a heart attack
when he sees what I brought him.

1044
01:43:40,354 --> 01:43:43,438
Throttle back. You're losing the cleats.

1045
01:43:45,609 --> 01:43:48,279
My God, this one, too. They're both going.

1046
01:43:48,612 --> 01:43:52,942
- He's eating his way through that line.
- He's working his way right up to us.

1047
01:43:53,576 --> 01:43:56,031
Come on, Quint. Hurry!

1048
01:43:57,997 --> 01:43:59,242
Out of my way.

1049
01:44:04,503 --> 01:44:05,534
Watch it.

1050
01:44:09,592 --> 01:44:12,165
Untie this. He'll pull out the transom.

1051
01:44:16,015 --> 01:44:17,343
Make it fast.

1052
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:20,307
I can't. It's trying to run.

1053
01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:25,187
Pull, you son of a bitch!

1054
01:44:27,735 --> 01:44:30,107
Go ahead. Pull your bloody heart out.

1055
01:44:36,869 --> 01:44:38,280
It's impossible!

1056
01:44:54,803 --> 01:44:56,843
We're breaking up! Cut it!

1057
01:44:58,307 --> 01:44:59,718
Watch your hands!

1058
01:45:00,726 --> 01:45:02,802
Cut it quick. I can't hold it!

1059
01:45:24,124 --> 01:45:26,532
He can't stay down
with three barrels on him.

1060
01:45:26,627 --> 01:45:28,785
Not with three barrels, he can't.

1061
01:45:29,046 --> 01:45:30,540
What about us?

1062
01:45:32,174 --> 01:45:35,092
Get the pump out of the locker
in front of you, will you?

1063
01:45:35,177 --> 01:45:36,719
We're gonna sink, aren't we?

1064
01:45:36,804 --> 01:45:39,555
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.

1065
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:47,772
Starting to go under.

1066
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:51,435
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.

1067
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:28,428
You ever have one do this before?

1068
01:46:30,816 --> 01:46:31,847
No.

1069
01:47:03,432 --> 01:47:05,638
He's chasin' us. I don't believe it.

1070
01:47:11,607 --> 01:47:13,813
I'm gonna draw him into the shallows.

1071
01:47:13,901 --> 01:47:17,815
Draw him into the shallow water.
I'm gonna draw him in and drown him.

1072
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,646
- We're headin' in, Brody.
- Thank Christ!

1073
01:47:28,457 --> 01:47:30,948
- You ever had a great white do that?
- No.

1074
01:47:37,258 --> 01:47:39,001
How far do we have to go?

1075
01:47:41,887 --> 01:47:44,461
Don't put that much pressure on it.

1076
01:47:54,483 --> 01:47:57,354
- Goddamn it.
- Shut up. Get back there.

1077
01:48:03,075 --> 01:48:04,071
Hold on.

1078
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:23,843
"Farewell and adieu to you,
fair Spanish ladies

1079
01:48:26,765 --> 01:48:31,641
"Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain

1080
01:48:33,188 --> 01:48:37,269
"For we received order
for to sail back to Boston"

1081
01:48:38,736 --> 01:48:41,143
You idiot, you burned out the bearings.

1082
01:48:42,823 --> 01:48:46,239
All right stop the boat. Stop the boat.
Stop it.

1083
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:29,011
What exactly can you do
with these things of yours?

1084
01:50:33,225 --> 01:50:37,305
I think I can pump 20 ccm
of strychnine nitrate into him.

1085
01:50:37,771 --> 01:50:39,563
If I can get close enough.

1086
01:50:42,484 --> 01:50:44,975
Get this little needle through his skin?

1087
01:50:46,906 --> 01:50:48,483
No, I can't do that.

1088
01:50:49,909 --> 01:50:53,028
If I can get him close to the cage,
I can get him in the mouth.

1089
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:56,987
- That shark'll rip that cage to pieces.
- You got any better suggestions?

1090
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:23,973
Easy.

1091
01:51:26,487 --> 01:51:27,685
Up she goes.

1092
01:52:22,751 --> 01:52:24,210
Ain't got no spit.

1093
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:42,051
Try and keep him off me until I'm lower.

1094
01:52:44,857 --> 01:52:46,481
Okay, okay, I'm ready.

1095
01:55:42,785 --> 01:55:46,485
Bring him up, goddamn it.
Bring him up now!

1096
01:55:52,086 --> 01:55:53,829
Pull it up. Pull it.

1097
01:56:04,390 --> 01:56:06,548
Come on, Quint, bring him in.

1098
01:56:09,728 --> 01:56:11,104
It's giving way.

1099
01:56:23,117 --> 01:56:24,990
Rig something!

1100
01:56:28,455 --> 01:56:29,451
Got it?

1101
01:56:33,419 --> 01:56:34,617
It's comin'.

1102
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:38,205
Slower.

1103
01:59:53,285 --> 01:59:54,827
Show me the tank.

1104
02:00:13,222 --> 02:00:14,253
Blow up!

1105
02:00:17,726 --> 02:00:19,470
Smile, you son of a bitch!

1106
02:01:48,817 --> 02:01:49,897
Quint?

1107
02:01:51,153 --> 02:01:52,232
No.

1108
02:02:01,664 --> 02:02:03,372
Can we get in on those?

1109
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:11,541
What day is this?

1110
02:02:13,717 --> 02:02:16,339
It's Wednesday. It's Tuesday, I think.

1111
02:02:18,013 --> 02:02:19,840
I think the tide's with us.

1112
02:02:20,766 --> 02:02:22,225
Keep kicking.

1113
02:02:25,646 --> 02:02:27,389
I used to hate the water.

1114
02:02:29,984 --> 02:02:31,526
I can't imagine why.

1115
02:02:34,321 --> 02:02:35,732
