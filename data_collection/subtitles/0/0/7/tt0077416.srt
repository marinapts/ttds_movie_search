1
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,460
How you doing?

2
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:33,254
Hey, watch out,
Axel.

3
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,923
We'll be calling him
old fireballs after tonight.

4
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,426
Really?
Not bad.

5
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:42,430
Hey, Steve, now that
you're going into the Army,

6
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,515
how about giving my $20 back?

7
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:54,359
All right, boys.

8
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:55,568
Hey, take care, buddy.

9
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,362
I'll see you, fellows.

10
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:58,404
Freddy!

11
00:04:58,488 --> 00:04:59,405
Hi, Mike!

12
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:00,531
Be good.

13
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:02,075
Did you hear about
the happy Roman?

14
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:03,534
Yeah?

15
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:04,786
He was glad he ate her.

16
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:06,120
Come on, let's go.

17
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:07,455
Where's Stan?
All right.

18
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,623
Hey, Stan,
let's go!

19
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,791
Take care of yourself.

20
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:11,918
Give us a call.
Write us.

21
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:13,795
Take care. I'll see you later. So long.

22
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:14,837
Okay, bye-bye.

23
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:16,631
Take care of yourself. Take it easy.

24
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,716
Don't get your ass
shot off.

25
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,051
I won't.
Good luck.

26
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,385
Okay.

27
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:24,180
Hey, Mike, take care of
yourself. Good luck to you.

28
00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:25,431
Stay out of trouble.

29
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,517
Kill a few for me, too.
I will. Stay out of trouble.

30
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:29,018
Hey, little killer.

31
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:30,102
Let's go.

32
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:31,479
Hey!

33
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:36,025
Hey, Axel, there's Stan.
Hi, Stanley.

34
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,902
Hi, Stanley,
you asshole.

35
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:39,487
Hey, Stan!

36
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,529
Get back there.

37
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:42,615
Stan, it's no use.

38
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:44,200
Come on, Stosh,
you're beautiful now.

39
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:47,119
You're still
an ugly bastard, Stan.

40
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:48,704
Good luck to you
in the Army.

41
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:49,997
Hey, Stanley!

42
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,583
Come on, come on.

43
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,503
Stosh, let's get
the hell out of here.

44
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:57,088
Come on, Stan. Let's go.

45
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:00,508
Let's go. Come on.

46
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:05,388
Very mature, very mature,
well-adapted individuals.

47
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:07,223
Take it easy.
Whoa!

48
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:09,058
Hey, look at that.
Let's go. Come on.

49
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:10,059
Whoa!

50
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:11,560
What the hell is that?

51
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:13,479
Where? Oh, yeah.

52
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,441
Holy shit,
you know what that is?

53
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,235
Those are sun dogs.

54
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:20,486
What does
it mean?

55
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:22,153
It means a blessing
on the hunter,

56
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:24,155
sent by the Great Wolf
to his children.

57
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,157
What the fuck are you
talking about?

58
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,909
No, it's an old
Indian thing.

59
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,536
You're full of shit.

60
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,497
Stanley, would I shit you
about something like that?

61
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:35,333
You know, Mike,

62
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,586
there's times when nobody but
a doctor can understand you.

63
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:40,505
That's an omen,
you know that?

64
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:42,298
You know that we could
have one great

65
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:43,883
fucking hunting
trip tonight?

66
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,927
Yeah, Mike, I don't know
where the hell

67
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:47,428
you come up
with all this shit.

68
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:49,389
Hey, wait a minute.

69
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,057
What are you-
What, are you thinking

70
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,142
of going
deer hunting tonight?

71
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:55,979
No, not tonight.
I'm getting married tonight,

72
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,439
and you fucking guys are
going deer hunting?

73
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:01,359
Hey, first we get you legal,
tuck you into bed with Angela.

74
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:02,443
Hey!

75
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:03,736
You guys are
all fucking nuts.

76
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:04,779
Are we mad?

77
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,823
Boy, you're all crazy.
Life is over.

78
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,199
Yeah, right.

79
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:10,243
You're getting married,
we're crazy?

80
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:11,661
It's all right.

81
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:13,371
Hey, it's all right.
We'll be right there.

82
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:15,331
We'll be right with you.
All of us, won't we?

83
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:16,624
Right?
Am I right?

84
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,376
Fuckin' A, man.
Right.

85
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:19,961
Come on.

86
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:22,839
Come on, you guys, I'm buying
the first round this morning.

87
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,257
Hey, hey, Steven!
Steven!

88
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:27,301
Any, uh, help you might need
tonight, just feel free to call on me.

89
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:28,344
Ooh!

90
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:30,596
Hey, Stanley, sometimes your
sense of humor ain't funny.

91
00:07:30,722 --> 00:07:31,889
Come on,
Steven.

92
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,099
Willing fingers.

93
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:34,308
Extra lips.

94
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,853
Fucking A, man.

95
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,855
Hey, you're a regular poet,
Axel.

96
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,523
I couldn't agree
with you more.

97
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:41,607
Get in there.

98
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:42,734
Come on, come on.

99
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:49,157
I do.

100
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:52,910
I do.

101
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,540
I do.

102
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:12,471
Oh, my God!

103
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,652
I still do not
believe this.

104
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:29,614
My own boy,
with a strange girl.

105
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:32,450
And not so thin,
if you understand my meaning.

106
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,327
Not such a thin girl.

107
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,913
The next thing you know,
he goes to Vietnam.

108
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:44,003
I do not understand, Father.

109
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:48,674
I understand nothing anymore.

110
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:50,343
Nothing.

111
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:54,513
Why?

112
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:56,599
Why?

113
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,686
Can you explain?

114
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:03,022
Can anyone explain?

115
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,009
Pass him on the inside.

116
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:33,260
You'd never do it.

117
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,387
Shut the hell up.
I'm trying to concentrate.

118
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:36,931
It's your Caddy
against my truck.

119
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:37,973
Today your lucky day?

120
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:39,516
You can't make it.

121
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:50,903
Oh, boy!

122
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:52,196
You got it!

123
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:59,078
Hey, Axel,
you opened the window.

124
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:00,079
Mike!

125
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:01,789
Hey, mighty Mike!

126
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:03,207
Oh, Axel!

127
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,208
Here's your truck back.

128
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,291
Oh, hell!

129
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,834
Wouldn't wanna
take advantage of you.

130
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,920
I hope you didn't
break an axle. Axle!

131
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:11,339
It's a million-to-one shot
against a sure thing.

132
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:13,257
There's no such thing
as a sure thing.

133
00:10:13,383 --> 00:10:14,926
Did you see that?

134
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,470
Hey, how're you doing?

135
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:21,933
Don't take
anybody's money.

136
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:23,768
Don't take my money.
Take his money.

137
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,279
Give my friends down here
my warm regards.

138
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:44,330
Hey, I got $100

139
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:47,375
says the Eagles never cross
the 50 in the next half.

140
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,544
And the Steelers
win by what? 20.

141
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:50,878
I got an extra
$20 that says

142
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:52,630
the Eagles' quarterback
wears a dress.

143
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:56,050
You got it!

144
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:58,928
Take your money off the bar.
Drinks are on the house!

145
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,827
Oh, did I get all wet?

146
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:23,911
I don't wanna know.

147
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,501
Amy!

148
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,424
Come on, Amy.

149
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,724
You know what,

150
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:48,602
Joe, maybe we could use
some more flags.

151
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,357
Is that all right?

152
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:54,400
Uh,

153
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,027
up a bit, I would say.
Wouldn't you say so?

154
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,738
No, no, down.

155
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:02,867
Oh, it's a beautiful cake.

156
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:08,247
You've earned a drink.

157
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,502
You have
a beautiful cake.

158
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,883
I haven't forgotten
about you.

159
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:22,011
I have one for you, too.

160
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:50,080
Go to- Fucking hell.

161
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,086
I'll give every car in
the town a flat tire.

162
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:58,005
Every goddamned one.

163
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,381
Oh, daddy!

164
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:01,091
I'll do it.

165
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:08,098
I fucking mean what I say, girl. Shh.

166
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:09,600
Come on.

167
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:12,519
All around, like a sea. Oh, my God!

168
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:15,856
Ocean of flat tires.

169
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:18,484
Fucking...
No.

170
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:19,610
bitch!

171
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,446
All bitches.

172
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:26,033
I hate them.

173
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:27,117
Daddy.

174
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:28,493
Daddy, no,
it's me.

175
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,703
Fucking bitches.

176
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:33,916
Give them all flat tires.

177
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:09,450
<i>"You're just too good
to be true"</i>

178
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:11,118
That's great.

179
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:12,453
<i>"I can't take my eyes
off of you"</i>

180
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:14,330
Now, I'm gonna smoke your ass.

181
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:17,333
<i>"You'd be like heaven
to touch"</i>

182
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,377

love has arrived"</i>

<i>"And I thank God I'm alive"</i>

185
00:14:30,054 --> 00:14:31,764
It's my shot, right?

186
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,227
Come on, John.
Wipe off the tables.

187
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:39,688
This is it.
This is really it.

188
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:43,442
<i>"There's nothing else
to compare"</i>

189
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:45,194
I mean, here I go.

00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,699
<i>"There are no words
left to speak"</i>

191
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:55,246
There's no sense
in getting too relaxed, buddy.

192
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:58,582
<i>"Please let me know
that it's real"</i>

193
00:14:58,707 --> 00:14:59,833
Come on.

194
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,169
<i>"You're just too good

<i>"I wanna hold you so much"</i>

212

Jesus Christ!

213
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:19,830
To do this to
your own mother,

214
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:22,207
who prays for you
all her life.

215
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,837
Is your heart so cruel,
so unfeeling?

216
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,382
You marry this girl,
you leave her with me,

217
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:33,302
and you go with these bums
to the Vietnam!

218
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,137
Whoa, whoa!

219
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:38,974
One flight.

220
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,892
It's one flight upstairs.

221
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,394
When I come home...

222
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:43,770
One flight!

223
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:46,481
I love Angela.

224
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,318
And she loves me.

225
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:55,824
Wear a scarf today.

226
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,453
You don't wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

227
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,497
I'm not gonna wear
a scarf with a tuxedo.

228
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,301
You trying to
look like a prince?

229
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,219
What do you mean,
trying?

230
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,555
You should've done that
a long time ago,

231
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,806
that way it would've set.

232
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:03,891
I know.

233
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,352
Then why didn't you do it?

234
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:07,686
'Cause I forgot.

235
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:11,231
Can you still see?

236
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:18,363
For Christ's sake, Mike. Steven is
getting married in a couple of hours,

237
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:19,990
I don't know
what the hell we're doing

238
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:22,117
talking about hunting
a last time before the Army.

239
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:24,912
The whole thing,
it's crazy.

240
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,623
I'll tell you one thing.

241
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:32,461
If I found out my life had
to end up in the mountains,

242
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:33,921
it'd be all right.

243
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:35,589
But it has to be in your mind.

244
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:37,591
What?

245
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,011
One shot?

246
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:45,432
Two is pussy.

247
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,976
I don't think about one shot
that much any more, Mike.

248
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:49,478
You have to think about
one shot.

249
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:50,896
One shot is what
it's all about.

250
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,606
A deer has to be taken
with one shot.

251
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,150
I try to tell people that,
they don't listen.

252
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,157
You really think
about Vietnam?

253
00:19:02,282 --> 00:19:03,283
Yeah.

254
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:06,745
I don't know.

255
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,331
I guess I'm thinking
about the deer.

256
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,916
Going to Nam.

257
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,086
I like the trees, you know?

258
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,797
I like the way the trees are
in the mountains,

259
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,507
it's all different.

260
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,596
The way the trees are.

261
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,601
I sound like
some asshole, right?

262
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,772
I'll tell you, Nick, you're the
only guy I go hunting with, you know?

263
00:19:34,064 --> 00:19:36,066
I like a guy
with quick moves and speed.

264
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,943
I ain't gonna hunt
with no assholes.

265
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:39,528
Who's an asshole?

266
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:41,321
Who do you think's
an asshole?

267
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,824
They're all
a bunch of assholes.

268
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:46,326
I mean, I love them.
They're great guys.

269
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,995
But, you know,
without you, I'd hunt alone.

270
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:51,039
Seriously,
that's what I'd do.

271
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:52,874
But you're a fucking nut.

272
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,709
You know that, Mike?
You're a maniac.

273
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,253
Control freak.

274
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,964
I just don't like
no surprises.

275
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:04,135
Damn thing won't open.

276
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:05,428
Well, give it
a kick!

277
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:08,640
Hey, hey, not like that, not
like that. Here, here, here.

278
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,726
See that?

279
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:12,852
Fuckin' A.

280
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:15,939
Unreal.

281
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,570
Axel, now I know why you're not
still kicking for the Steelers.

282
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,530
You know,

283
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,448
I love Mike's car.

284
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:28,201
Yeah, some cars,
they just sit.

285
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:30,161
I mean, you never know
with a car like this

286
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:31,913
where the hell
it's gonna take you.

287
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,874
It makes me feel safe.

288
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:38,586
Hey!

289
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:45,260
Axel's humping
Mike's Coupe de Ville.

290
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:49,597
Oh, Axel, get out of there.

291
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,725
Let's get the carnations.
Oh, they're over there.

292
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:53,309
Get up, get up.

293
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,603
What are you doing?
Come on, sit up.

294
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:57,939
Don't pass, Axel!

295
00:20:58,064 --> 00:21:00,108
Here, put this on.
You have to have that on.

296
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,943
Crummy tuxedo.

297
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:04,237
Your tuxedo's been
stuck a million times.

298
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:05,530
Where'd you get this thing?

299
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:06,698
Fucking A.

300
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:07,907
You're not funny.

301
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:08,908
I'm beautiful, right?

302
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:10,743
No, you're not beautiful.

303
00:21:11,494 --> 00:21:13,163
All set.
Thanks, honey.

304
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:15,831
I'm not...
Let go!

305
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:18,375
Let go!

306
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:23,589
You can't even sit up,
Axel! Oh!

307
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:26,341
Axel, come on, sit up.

308
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:28,218
Beautiful.
Can't even sit up.

309
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:34,641
Linda, what's the matter?

310
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,143
I was gonna pick you up.

311
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:37,644
Hi.

312
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:39,646
What's the matter?

313
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:40,772
He hit me.

314
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:41,940
Don't cry.

315
00:21:43,984 --> 00:21:46,153
Come here,
I want to ask you something.

316
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,489
Hey, wait a minute,
God damn it.

317
00:21:49,615 --> 00:21:51,033
You don't walk away from me.
Nick!

318
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:52,576
What the hell is that
on your face?

319
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:56,913
Nicky, you and Michael are
going away in a couple of days.

320
00:21:56,997 --> 00:22:00,334
I was just wondering if I
could use this place to stay.

321
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:01,793
Sure.

322
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:03,170
I want to pay you both.

323
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:05,422
And I was thinking-

324
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:07,007
What are you talking about?

325
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:13,722
I would want to pay you,
Nick.

326
00:22:16,475 --> 00:22:17,976
It's me you're talking to.

327
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,603
How long have you
known me for?

328
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:24,816
What?

329
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,160
Oh!

330
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,060
Have you, Steven,

331
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:25,728
a free will
and a firm intention

332
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:28,189
to take unto yourself
as wife, this woman, Angela,

333
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:30,108
whom you see before you?

334
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:31,275
I do.

335
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:34,362
You have not promised yourself
to any other bride?

336
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:36,197
I have not.

337
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:37,448
Have you, Angela,

338
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:39,242
a free will and
a firm intention,

339
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:42,036
to take unto yourself
as husband this man, Steven,

340
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,871
whom you see before you?

341
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:44,997
I have.

342
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:47,792
You have not promised yourself
to any other man?

343
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,168
I have not.

344
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:54,048
Blessed is the kingdom

345
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:57,301
of the Father and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

346
00:24:57,677 --> 00:25:01,972
Now and ever
and unto ages of ages.

347
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:07,352
Amen.

348
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:18,709
Whoo-hoo.

349
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,019
Hey!

350
00:31:35,738 --> 00:31:38,449
For a buck,
you get a shooter, a cigar,

351
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:40,868
and a dance with
the beautiful bride.

352
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:43,287
Fuckin' A.

353
00:31:43,412 --> 00:31:44,455
Hey, you.

354
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:46,582
And you're on your way.

355
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,949
<i>May I have your attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

356
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:04,700
<i>Quite, please, please.</i>

357
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,376
<i>That's really wonderful,
thank you.</i>

358
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,253
<i>May I have your attention,
please?</i>

359
00:33:15,336 --> 00:33:17,046
<i>I have a very, very important

One minute...

382
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:25,090
You nut, you want me to dance?
You want me to dance?

383
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:26,884
Hey, Nicky!

You're okay.

409
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,097
No, I am not.

410
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:58,015
No, you're very fancy.

411
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:03,771
You want a beer
or something like that?

412
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:05,564
You want a beer
or something?

413
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,775
Okay. Sure.

414
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,151
What kind of beer
would you like?

415
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:10,236
What?

416
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,823
I don't know.
I don't care. Any kind.

417
00:37:13,906 --> 00:37:15,533
I'll get you a Rolling Rock.

418
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:16,784
Okay.

419
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,161
It's a good beer,
it's the best around.

420
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:20,371
Huh?
Yeah, okay.

421
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:21,372
Rolling Rock?

422
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:22,414
Yeah.

423
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,499

Hey, Jerry.

433
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:55,656
Sorry. I'm sorry.

434
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:57,199
It's okay.

435
00:37:57,282 --> 00:37:59,284
Jerry,
give us two Rolling Rocks

436
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:01,286
and give me
a chaser on the side.

437
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:05,249
It's okay.
It's a wedding, you know.

438
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:08,293
You're supposed to let go
and have fun. All that.

439
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:12,798
You really like
Nick a lot, huh?

440
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,842
Anybody else for a shooter?

441
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:16,677
Yeah.

442
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:22,975
Thank you.

443
00:38:26,812 --> 00:38:28,230
<i>Thank you.</i>

444
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,087
Help!

445
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:55,966
Put me down!
What are you doing? Axel!

446
00:39:09,187 --> 00:39:10,564
Axel, no!

447
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:12,816
Axel, put me down!
What are you-

448
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,151
I'm gonna kiss you.

449
00:39:14,276 --> 00:39:15,235
Axel!

450
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:16,862
Stop! Stop!

451
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,614
Stab you.
I'm gonna stab you.

452
00:39:19,698 --> 00:39:20,824
You wanna fuck
or fight?

453
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:21,908
Axel!

454
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:30,125
I think I might like to dance
with the lady, if you don't mind.

455
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:39,593
Have you known him long?

456
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:40,635
Oh!

457
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:55,191
Are you having fun?

458
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:09,079
You know what that
son of a bitch is doing?

459
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,669
He's got his hand
on her ass.

460
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:19,465
Its only-

461
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:22,301
It's only a wedding,
Stanley.

462
00:40:22,426 --> 00:40:24,595
What do you mean,
it's only a wedding?

463
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,389
Look, he did it again,
he just did it.

464
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:29,558
C'mon, I gotta go get
my gun out of my coat.

465
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,186
Go get your gun,
go get it.

466
00:40:56,543 --> 00:40:58,086
Whoa, whoa.

467
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,798
Time out. Time out.

468
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:21,318
You hurt me,
you son of a bitch.

469
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:23,153
You punched me right here.

470
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:52,933
I'm gonna put him
on his fucking ass.

471
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:55,811
Stan is crazy.

472
00:41:55,894 --> 00:41:57,187
Why? What happened?

473
00:41:57,312 --> 00:41:58,772
Stan is crazy.

474
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:00,774
There's a Green Beret!

475
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,152
Hey! Whoo!

476
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:07,614
Jerry, Jerry,
give the man a drink.

477
00:42:07,906 --> 00:42:09,116
Hey!

478
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,534
Give him a drink.

479
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:11,868
Sir?

480
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:12,911
Sir?

481
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:13,995
Sir?

482
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:24,881
Don't cause
any kind of problem.

483
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:27,175
No, I'm just
gonna talk to the man.

484
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:29,010
We're going over there.

485
00:42:29,469 --> 00:42:31,179
Sir, Mike Vronsky.

486
00:42:34,558 --> 00:42:35,684
Nick.

487
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:37,519
This is the groom,
Steve.

488
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:39,020
I'm the best man.

489
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:42,732
We're going Airborne,
sir.

490
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:45,068
I hope they send us
where the bullets are flying

491
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:46,653
where the fighting's
the worst, huh?

492
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:48,113
That's right.

493
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:50,073
Fuck it.

494
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:53,785
Fuck it?
What did he say?

495
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,786
"Fuck it."
"Fuck it."

496
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:56,329
That's what I thought.

497
00:42:58,873 --> 00:43:00,750
Well,
what's it like over there?

498
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,544
Can you tell us anything?

499
00:43:04,254 --> 00:43:05,422
Fuck it.

500
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:08,842
Okay. Fuck it.

501
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:11,720
Fuck him.

502
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:19,060
Fuck it!

503
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:20,812
Mike!

504
00:43:20,937 --> 00:43:23,648
Hey, hey,
fuck who?

505
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,860
Fuck who?

506
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,447
Who the hell is he?

507
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:31,739
Who the fuck knows?

508
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:33,783
He looks like
a fucking hillbilly.

509
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,703
Give him another drink,
Jerry, just the same.

510
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:38,328
Hey, fuck it.

511
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,716
I caught it.

512
00:45:21,264 --> 00:45:22,933
Will you marry me?

513
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:26,019
Yeah.

514
00:45:27,771 --> 00:45:29,064
You would?

515
00:45:29,564 --> 00:45:30,774
Mmm-hmm.

516
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:34,402
What I mean is,
if we get back from...

517
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:37,530
When we get back.

518
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:40,867
I don't know
what the hell I mean.

519
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:43,953
What goes through your mind
comes out of your mouth.

520
00:45:44,537 --> 00:45:46,164
<i>Angela and Steven!</i>

521
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:51,127
<i>If you don't spill a drop</i>

522
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:54,047
<i>it's good luck for
the rest of your life.</i>

523
00:48:01,756 --> 00:48:03,633
Come on.
Come on!

524
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:13,602
Hey!

525
00:48:17,897 --> 00:48:19,607
Don't worry about
what Stan says.

526
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,401
Just forget that.
Forget what Stan says.

527
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:23,361
He's got a big
fucking mouth.

528
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:26,489
That's enough. Come here. Hey!

529
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:27,657
Give me a crack.

530
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:30,326
I never really did it
with Angela, Nicky.

531
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,874
Great,
that's great.

532
00:48:37,917 --> 00:48:40,086
That's my last
one true secret.

533
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:43,089
It's nothing, it's nothing,
just forget about it.

534
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:45,550
Angela!

535
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:50,722
Oh, Angela!

536
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,724
What am I gonna do
when she has a baby?

537
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:53,933
That's Angela's part,
right?

538
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,186
Leave all that to her.
Just hang loose.

539
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:57,395
Hang loose?
Hang loose.

540
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,272
What are you so worried about?
Be happy.

541
00:48:59,397 --> 00:49:00,440
Get out of here.

542
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:01,858
We don't wanna see you
anymore.

543
00:49:01,983 --> 00:49:03,401
Look at this maniac.

544
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:07,280
See you Monday
on the train.

545
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,073
Hey!

546
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:12,076
Drive careful.

547
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,245
You didn't know
that about Angela, huh?

548
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:16,289
Right?
That's bullshit, man.

549
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:17,665
Bullshit?
Bullshit.

550
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,292
Yeah? I happen
to know it's true.

551
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,252
That's bullshit.
I happen to know it's true.

552
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:22,420
You're full of bullshit.

553
00:49:22,545 --> 00:49:23,922
All right, you want to bet?
Yeah.

554
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:25,757
Go, put your money
where your mouth is.

555
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:27,634
Go fuck yourself.
Go fuck yourself.

556
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:29,177
Eh, grow up.

557
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:35,933
All right!

558
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:51,783
Michael, what are you doing?

559
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,451
Hey, Mike!

560
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,286
Michael!

561
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:58,831
Michael, what the hell
are you doing?

562
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:00,958
Michael!

563
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:05,213
Michael,
what the hell are you doing?

564
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:06,464
Michael!

565
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,218
Fuck it!

566
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:11,928
Michael, come back here.

567
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:15,097
What the hell is he doing?

568
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:17,433
Michael,
what the hell are you doing?

569
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,436
Michael, come back here,
Michael!

570
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:23,981
Michael, we love you.
Get back here!

571
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:26,317
I gotta talk to you!

572
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,329
Mike!

573
00:50:46,629 --> 00:50:47,546
Hey!

574
00:51:13,697 --> 00:51:14,698
Shit!

575
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,953
I must be out of
my fucking mind.

576
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:21,788
I must be out of
my mind.

577
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:30,004
I don't know,
everything's going so fast.

578
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,756
Man, oh, man!

579
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,260
Hey, Nick.

580
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,264
You think we'll ever
come back?

581
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:40,557
From Nam?

582
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:41,599
Yeah.

583
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,063
You know something?

584
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,065
The whole thing,

585
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,985
it's right here.

586
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:54,737
I love
this fucking place.

587
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:58,533
I know that sounds crazy,
but if anything happens, Mike,

588
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:01,077
don't leave-
don't leave me over there.

589
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,579
You got-you gotta...

590
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:03,997
Just don't leave me.

591
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,498
You gotta promise me that,
Mike.

592
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:06,624
Hey!

593
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:12,922
No, man, you got-you gotta-
you gotta promise. Definitely.

594
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,758
Hey, Nicky.
Huh?

595
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:17,260
You got it, pal.

596
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,473
<i>"Geronimo!"</i>

597
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:08,102
<i>"Hit your silk and check your
canopy and take a look around"</i>

598
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:11,105
<i>"The air is filled with troopers
set for battle on the ground"</i>

599
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:14,442
<i>"Till we join the stick of
angels killed on Leyte and Luzon"</i>

600
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,778
<i>"Shout Geronimo! Geronimo!" It's
the Screaming Eagles Airborne Song.</i>

601
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:21,157
<i>"It's a gory road to glory
but we're ready, here we go!"</i>

602
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,783
<i>"Shout Geronimo!"
Bunch of assholes.</i>

603
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,327
<i>"Geronimo!"
Fuckin' A!</i>

604
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,079
<i>"Look out below,
look out below"</i>

605
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,625
<i>"Let me be free,
let me be free"</i>

606
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,627
I can't remember
the rest of the words.

607
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,669
That's okay.

608
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:38,674
<i>"You'll always
be happy with me</i>

609
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,509
Chickenshit,
get scared.

610
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:56,358
Don't push.

611
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,319
Fucking cold.

612
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,324
36 beers.

613
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,533
Oh!

614
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,534
What?

615
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:06,535
Come on.

616
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:10,039
All right, I'll go already.
Wait, wait.

617
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,423
Did you ever piss and take a
drink of beer at the same time?

618
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:24,887
Oh!

619
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,893
I just barely got
a chance to shake it off.

620
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,269
Wait! Come on!

621
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:33,687
Fuck.

622
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,858
Bastards!

623
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,820
Sons of bitches!

624
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,232
You guys
going my way?

625
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,525
Come on.

626
00:55:26,697 --> 00:55:27,657
Fuck!

627
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,746
That's not funny!

628
00:55:53,474 --> 00:55:55,268
Don't fuck
around, now.

629
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,896
Come on.
Don't fuck around.

630
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:00,356
Don't fuck around.

631
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,818
Don't fuck around.

632
00:56:31,762 --> 00:56:32,680
Let me out!

633
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:34,181
Out, out.
Let me out.

634
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:35,307
Get out.

635
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,188
This is not it!

636
00:56:41,313 --> 00:56:42,857
Definitely.
This is not it.

637
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,191
They changed it.
No kidding.

638
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,110
Somehow,
they changed it.

639
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:48,195
Like this happens
every goddamm year.

640
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,364
You're full of shit,
Stanley.

641
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:51,907
Who did you say
was full of shit?

642
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:54,368
You're full of shit,
you're always full of shit.

643
00:56:55,494 --> 00:56:56,704
I'm starving.

644
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:58,038
Eat that.

645
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:00,040
Nicky, let me
ask you a question.

646
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:01,458
How come I never
see you eating?

647
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,044
I like to starve myself.
Keeps the fear up.

648
00:57:04,545 --> 00:57:06,088
It ain't natural.

649
00:57:06,213 --> 00:57:07,548
Come on, John.

650
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:08,674
Hey, it's mine.

651
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,009
You really
want it that bad?

652
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:11,385
You're goddamn right!

653
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,178
Hey, give me a Twinkie,
Mike.

654
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:16,724
What are you guys,
a bunch of cripples? Here.

655
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:24,523
That's mustard.

656
00:57:24,648 --> 00:57:25,566
What?

657
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,111
He put mustard
on his Twinkie.

658
00:57:30,362 --> 00:57:32,906
You're talking like
a goddamn traffic cop.

659
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,366
Incredible.

660
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:36,910
Come on, give me a beer,
Mike. Come on.

661
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,871
I can't believe you guys.

662
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:40,497
What the hell am
I doing with you?

663
00:57:40,622 --> 00:57:42,041
This is not it.

664
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:44,585
They changed it,
somehow they changed it.

665
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:47,880
You couldn't find your own ass
with two hands.

666
00:57:47,963 --> 00:57:48,964
Fuckin' A.

667
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:50,090
Hey, you know.

668
00:57:50,215 --> 00:57:52,926
We forgot to toast
Steven and Angela.

669
00:57:54,595 --> 00:57:55,888
Steven and Angela!

670
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:03,437
What?

671
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:10,110
Don't make me laugh when
I have things in my mouth.

672
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:11,945
I can't take you guys
anywhere.

673
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,238
What the hell are you doing?

674
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:14,990
Take your hands off
the fucking bread.

675
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,241
You can dress him up,

676
00:58:16,366 --> 00:58:18,368
but you can't take
him anywhere.

677
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:20,496
Come on! Come on!
What the fuck are you doing?

678
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:22,581
That was mine,
you assholes.

679
00:58:27,794 --> 00:58:30,130
Fucking assholes.
I can't fucking...

680
00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:33,507
Fuckin' A!

681
00:58:33,674 --> 00:58:34,884
You know, Axel,

682
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:36,802
you got a really terrific
vocabulary.

683
00:58:36,886 --> 00:58:38,054
Fuckin' A.

684
00:58:38,137 --> 00:58:39,430
Hey, watch the gear.

685
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:40,765
Watch the rifle.

686
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:42,600
Give me my bag.

687
00:58:45,186 --> 00:58:46,896
It's getting cold.
Huh?

688
00:58:48,356 --> 00:58:50,942
Hey, Mike, you got
any extra thermal socks?

689
00:58:54,528 --> 00:58:55,696
Fuckin' A.

690
00:58:57,531 --> 00:58:58,532
Hey, Mike!

691
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:01,535
You got any
extra thermal socks?

692
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,747
Never mind,
I got them.

693
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:07,875
Where the hell's my boots?

694
00:59:10,544 --> 00:59:12,296
Anybody see my boots?

695
00:59:13,547 --> 00:59:15,174
Somebody took my boots.

696
00:59:15,383 --> 00:59:17,009
I bought them special.

697
00:59:18,511 --> 00:59:19,470
All right.

698
00:59:19,595 --> 00:59:22,389
All right, you guys, whoever
took my boots, I want them back.

699
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:23,974
I got a boot for you, Stan.

700
00:59:24,058 --> 00:59:25,893
Right up your ass.

701
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:28,521
Hey, Mike.

702
00:59:31,565 --> 00:59:33,400
Hey, Mike, let me borrow
your spares, huh?

703
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:34,610
Your extra pair?

704
00:59:34,735 --> 00:59:35,903
No, Stan.

705
00:59:37,279 --> 00:59:38,280
No?

706
00:59:40,616 --> 00:59:41,951
What do you mean, "no?"

707
00:59:42,034 --> 00:59:43,994
Just what I said, no.
"No" means no.

708
00:59:46,038 --> 00:59:48,624
Some fucking friend, you're some
fucking friend, you know that?

709
00:59:48,749 --> 00:59:49,792
You got to learn, Stanley.

710
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:52,628
Every time you come up here you
got your goddamn head up your ass.

711
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:54,713
Maybe he likes
the view from up there, huh?

712
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,012
Every time he comes up,
he's got no knife,

713
01:00:02,096 --> 01:00:05,391
he's got no jacket, he's got
no pants, he's got no boots.

714
01:00:05,516 --> 01:00:09,144
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries around like John Wayne.

715
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:10,729
That ain't gonna help you.

716
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:13,565
Oh, what the hell, Mike.
Give him the boots.

717
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:15,567
No way.
I ain't giving him no boots.

718
01:00:15,693 --> 01:00:17,403
No more, no more,
that's it.

719
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,365
You're a fucking bastard,
you know that?

720
01:00:21,782 --> 01:00:23,075
Stanley, you see this?

721
01:00:23,158 --> 01:00:25,202
This is this,
this ain't something else.

722
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:27,121
This is this.

723
01:00:27,246 --> 01:00:29,498
From now on,
you're on your own.

724
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:35,754
I fixed you up
a million times.

725
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:38,090
I fixed him up
a million times.

726
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,385
I don't know now many times I
must have fixed him up with girls,

727
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,470
and nothing ever happens.
Zero.

728
01:00:43,637 --> 01:00:45,305
Hey, you know your trouble,
Mike, huh?

729
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:47,474
Nobody ever knows what the
fuck you're talking about.

730
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:48,809
Huh? "This is this."

731
01:00:48,934 --> 01:00:51,478
What the hell's that supposed
to mean? "This is this."

732
01:00:51,603 --> 01:00:54,273
I mean, is that some faggot-sounding
bullshit, or is that some-

733
01:00:54,398 --> 01:00:56,233
Shut up, Stan, will you?

734
01:00:56,316 --> 01:00:57,693
Hey, man,
you're out of line.

735
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,528
Watch out
with that gun, Stan.

736
01:00:59,653 --> 01:01:00,737
Do you know what I think?

737
01:01:00,863 --> 01:01:01,822
You know what I think?

738
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:04,324
There's times I swear, I
think you're a fucking faggot.

739
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:06,118
Hey, come on, you guys.

740
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:07,953
Last week, last week
he could've had that

741
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:09,913
new red-headed waitress
at the Bowladrome.

742
01:01:09,997 --> 01:01:11,331
He could've had it knocked.

743
01:01:11,456 --> 01:01:13,500
Look what he fucking did?
Nothing.

744
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:14,751
That's what.

745
01:01:14,877 --> 01:01:17,588
Shut up, Stan!
Just shut up.

746
01:01:17,713 --> 01:01:18,922
Just shut up.

747
01:01:19,047 --> 01:01:21,925
Take-Take Michael's
goddamn boots and shut up!

748
01:01:22,467 --> 01:01:23,844
Otherwise,
I'm goin' home.

749
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:25,679
Okay,
I'm going home right now.

750
01:01:25,804 --> 01:01:27,139
Get off my stuff.

751
01:01:27,264 --> 01:01:28,765
What the hell are you
doing in there?

752
01:01:31,685 --> 01:01:33,145
Hey, Stosh,

753
01:01:34,313 --> 01:01:35,564
I said no.

754
01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:42,863
What, are you gonna
shoot me?

755
01:01:43,196 --> 01:01:44,156
Huh?

756
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:45,657
Here.

757
01:02:06,887 --> 01:02:08,680
What's the matter with you?

758
01:02:10,182 --> 01:02:11,308
Stan.

759
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,126
Watch it, Mike! Watch it.

760
01:05:32,215 --> 01:05:33,717
Hey, Steven!

761
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:36,052
Hey, Angela,
I got a big gun!

762
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:42,934

Unbelievable!

787
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:31,529
Holy Christ,
I don't believe it.

788
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:33,740
Mike?

789
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:34,741
Mike!

790
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:36,576
Jesus Christ!

791
01:11:36,743 --> 01:11:37,702
Hey!

792
01:13:32,732 --> 01:13:34,442
Take it easy, Stevie!

793
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:37,487
Stevie, calm down!

794
01:13:46,788 --> 01:13:48,456
Think of something else.

795
01:13:48,665 --> 01:13:51,334
Control yourself.
Think of something else.

796
01:13:58,049 --> 01:13:59,717
We don't belong here.

797
01:14:16,818 --> 01:14:21,281
Take it easy.
It's gonna be okay.

798
01:14:23,241 --> 01:14:24,534
I'm all right.

799
01:14:43,428 --> 01:14:45,096
Okay. I'm okay.

800
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:47,056
Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

801
01:14:49,809 --> 01:14:51,269
It's okay,
it's okay.

802
01:14:52,603 --> 01:14:54,689
Take it easy, Stevie.
Stevie, take it easy.

803
01:14:59,777 --> 01:15:00,737
Mike.

804
01:15:08,745 --> 01:15:09,954
Come on.
Come on.

805
01:15:13,124 --> 01:15:14,375
I'm okay.

806
01:15:42,653 --> 01:15:44,739
That's all right. Okay.

807
01:15:44,864 --> 01:15:47,825
Okay, all right, press it,
press hard, press hard.

808
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:49,827
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm here.

809
01:15:50,286 --> 01:15:53,539
Go ahead. That's it.
That's it

810
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:54,749
Mike?

811
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:03,049
Shake it off. Shake it out.
Shake it out.

812
01:16:03,466 --> 01:16:05,676
Think of something else.
Think of home.

813
01:16:06,886 --> 01:16:07,845
Think of home.

814
01:16:09,972 --> 01:16:11,307
Think of Angela.

815
01:16:54,225 --> 01:16:56,894
They're gonna have
to kill my ass, Mike.

816
01:16:59,396 --> 01:17:01,482
Stevie, you gotta do it.
If you don't do it,

817
01:17:01,565 --> 01:17:03,692
they're gonna
throw you in the pit.

818
01:17:04,068 --> 01:17:06,278
They throw you in the pit,
you're gonna die.

819
01:17:06,403 --> 01:17:08,614
Go ahead, you gotta do it.
You can do it.

820
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:10,657
You can do it, Stevie.

821
01:17:17,455 --> 01:17:21,292
Look in my eyes. Stevie.
Stevie, look at me!

822
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:22,377
Mike?

823
01:17:22,502 --> 01:17:24,045
Do it! Do it!

824
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:27,215
Go ahead! Show them you got
balls. Show 'em you got balls.

825
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,092
Fuck you.

826
01:17:30,551 --> 01:17:31,594
Go ahead!

827
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:33,471
Shoot me.
Go ahead.

828
01:17:35,223 --> 01:17:36,432
Come on.

829
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,272
Go ahead.

830
01:17:43,398 --> 01:17:46,401
Go ahead, Stevie! Go ahead.
Show them you got balls!

831
01:17:46,526 --> 01:17:47,485
Go ahead!

832
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,292
Hey, kid.

833
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:07,922
Kid. Look at me,
Stevie, you did it.

834
01:18:12,593 --> 01:18:14,720
Stevie,
you showed these bastards.

835
01:18:15,263 --> 01:18:16,973
You showed 'em.

836
01:18:29,318 --> 01:18:30,695
Don't worry, kid.

837
01:18:33,072 --> 01:18:34,240
You did it.

838
01:18:50,715 --> 01:18:51,966
Michael!

839
01:18:53,426 --> 01:18:54,427
Michael!

840
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:55,553
Stevie!

841
01:19:03,853 --> 01:19:05,062
Michael.

842
01:19:05,604 --> 01:19:07,022
Michael.

843
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,488
Stevie!

844
01:19:14,572 --> 01:19:15,948
Stevie, don't worry.

845
01:19:18,701 --> 01:19:20,327
Mike, help!

846
01:19:21,203 --> 01:19:24,790
Oh, God!
There's rats in here!

847
01:19:45,477 --> 01:19:46,729
Nicky.

848
01:19:55,654 --> 01:19:57,114
Motherfucker!

849
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:59,366
Motherfucker!

850
01:20:00,951 --> 01:20:02,244
Nicky, listen.

851
01:20:06,749 --> 01:20:09,877
It's up to us now.
It's me and you.

852
01:20:10,961 --> 01:20:12,588
What about Steven?

853
01:20:12,838 --> 01:20:13,922
Forget him.

854
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:15,132
Forget him?

855
01:20:15,257 --> 01:20:17,384
Forget him.
He ain't gonna make it.

856
01:20:18,093 --> 01:20:20,304
Who do you think you are?
God?

857
01:20:23,015 --> 01:20:24,892
Look at him, he's in a daze.

858
01:20:26,268 --> 01:20:28,520
He ain't coming out,
he's in a dream.

859
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:29,897
Mike,
what are you saying?

860
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,273
I'm saying forget him, Nick.

861
01:20:31,356 --> 01:20:33,776
Get it through your head, or
you and me are both gone, too.

862
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:44,995
Gotta play with
more bullets.

863
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,121
What?

864
01:20:46,246 --> 01:20:47,623
More bullets.

865
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:52,085
I gotta get more
bullets in the gun.

866
01:20:53,544 --> 01:20:54,504
What?

867
01:20:54,629 --> 01:20:56,088
We got to play
with more bullets.

868
01:20:56,214 --> 01:20:58,090
More bullets in the gun?

869
01:20:58,299 --> 01:21:00,009
How many more bullets?

870
01:21:01,135 --> 01:21:02,053
Three.

871
01:21:11,354 --> 01:21:13,731
That means we've got
to play each other.

872
01:21:14,148 --> 01:21:15,483
More bullets
against each other?

873
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:16,692
What, are you crazy?

874
01:21:16,817 --> 01:21:18,694
Nicky, it's the only way.

875
01:21:22,281 --> 01:21:24,116
I'll pick the moment.

876
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,951
The game goes until I move.

877
01:21:26,035 --> 01:21:28,537
When I start shooting,
you go for the nearest guard

878
01:21:28,663 --> 01:21:30,498
you get his gun
and zap the fucker.

879
01:21:30,581 --> 01:21:32,375
I'm not ready for this.

880
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,126
You gotta listen to me.

881
01:21:34,251 --> 01:21:35,878
You want to stay down here
and die?

882
01:21:37,463 --> 01:21:38,464
Go.

883
01:21:38,547 --> 01:21:41,133
It's up to you.
Now, it's up to you.

884
01:21:41,217 --> 01:21:42,301
No!

885
01:21:42,426 --> 01:21:44,637
Hey, him against me!

886
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,679
Side by side.

887
01:21:48,015 --> 01:21:50,476
Get away! Get away!

888
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:52,144
Side by side.

889
01:21:52,311 --> 01:21:53,729
Man, I can't wait!

890
01:21:54,563 --> 01:21:55,815
Michael!

891
01:21:57,691 --> 01:21:58,609
Michael!

892
01:22:37,398 --> 01:22:38,565
Come on!

893
01:22:38,691 --> 01:22:42,152
These fuckers, these fuckers.
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, Nicky.

894
01:22:42,236 --> 01:22:44,530
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

895
01:22:44,613 --> 01:22:47,282
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead,
Nicky. That's it. That's it.

896
01:23:03,132 --> 01:23:06,593
I do three bullets.
Three, three.

897
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,596
We do three, huh?
One, two, three. Three.

898
01:23:20,524 --> 01:23:22,109
Three, three.

899
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:30,576
Three, three.

900
01:23:32,911 --> 01:23:34,830
Don't worry, Nick.
Don't worry.

901
01:23:34,955 --> 01:23:37,124
In five minutes,
we're gonna be out of here.

902

We're gonna be out of here.

903
01:23:49,803 --> 01:23:53,056
Now we got ourselves a game.
You and me. You and me.

904
01:24:15,871 --> 01:24:19,082
Okay. Okay, you want a game?

905
01:24:36,099 --> 01:24:37,141
Go ahead.

906
01:24:37,266 --> 01:24:38,267
No more.

907
01:24:38,392 --> 01:24:39,727
No, no more.

908
01:24:43,272 --> 01:24:44,440
That's fucked.

909
01:24:44,523 --> 01:24:46,442
I'm gonna will us
outta here.

910
01:24:46,525 --> 01:24:48,652
You've got an empty
chamber in that gun.

911
01:24:48,777 --> 01:24:51,238
Put an empty chamber
in that gun. Go ahead.

912
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:00,998
God damn it!

913
01:25:01,123 --> 01:25:02,499

Nicky.

914
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:05,044
Go ahead, shoot!
Shoot, Nicky!

915

You motherfucker!

916
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:12,968
No, no, no, Nicky!

917
01:25:17,139 --> 01:25:19,391
Now you're gonna die,
you motherfucker!

918
01:25:19,516 --> 01:25:21,518
You're gonna die!

919
01:25:22,978 --> 01:25:25,314
Go ahead, go ahead, Nicky,
just do it.

920
01:25:25,856 --> 01:25:27,608
Do it, do it, do it.

921

Go ahead.

922

It's all right.

924
01:25:44,374 --> 01:25:46,168
All right,

Come on, come on.

929

932
01:26:47,145 --> 01:26:49,147
Come on, damn it!
Come on.

933
01:26:55,153 --> 01:26:56,530
Oh, shit.

934
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,159
Get me up.

935
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,080
Steve!

936
01:27:10,627 --> 01:27:12,796
Get on it. Get on it.

942
01:27:38,488 --> 01:27:40,949
We don't belong here
in the jungle, Michael.

943
01:27:44,869 --> 01:27:47,622
Just get on, see?
Just get on.

944
01:27:47,747 --> 01:27:49,874
There's rats
in these waters.

945
01:27:52,585 --> 01:27:55,005
Hold on, right there.

946
01:27:55,922 --> 01:27:57,048
Hold on.

948
01:28:14,733 --> 01:28:15,442
Okay, buddy.

949
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:22,990
Mike.

950
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:30,664
Nicky.

951
01:28:55,522 --> 01:28:58,901
Mike, I want to go home, Mike.

952
01:30:02,881 --> 01:30:04,341
What is that?

953
01:30:06,176 --> 01:30:08,220
What's that sound, Michael?

954
01:30:21,191 --> 01:30:22,776
Hey! Hey! Hey!

955
01:31:34,847 --> 01:31:36,349
Go on! Go on!

I hit some rocks.

960

On my legs, Michael.

961
01:33:02,309 --> 01:33:04,853
Okay. Relax.

962
01:33:07,522 --> 01:33:09,441
Come on, come on.

963
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,153

964
01:33:13,278 --> 01:33:14,988

967
01:33:21,953 --> 01:33:23,288
I hit some rocks.

968
01:33:25,123 --> 01:33:26,291
Okay. All right.

969
01:33:34,549 --> 01:33:35,550
That's it.

970

971
01:33:38,553 --> 01:33:39,637
Okay.

972
01:33:39,721 --> 01:33:41,723
I can't feel my legs.

973
01:33:43,016 --> 01:33:45,810
All right, all right,
come on.

974
01:33:48,396 --> 01:33:49,689

975
01:33:54,819 --> 01:33:56,321
Push yourself.

976
01:34:05,413 --> 01:34:06,331
Whoa.

977
01:34:13,087 --> 01:34:15,590
Oh, man.

978
01:34:15,715 --> 01:34:19,260
Okay, kid, okay, shh, shh.

979
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:38,172
Take him.

980
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:40,216
Take him.

981
01:35:49,933 --> 01:35:51,351
Not me, him.

982
01:38:06,068 --> 01:38:08,446
Are you Nikanor Chevotarevich?

983
01:38:11,324 --> 01:38:13,284
Can you understand me,
Nikanor?

984
01:38:18,998 --> 01:38:20,583
Are you Chevotarevich?
Are you sure?

985
01:38:20,666 --> 01:38:21,792
Yes.

986
01:38:21,918 --> 01:38:24,462
Uh-huh, Chevotarevich.
Is that a Russian name?

987
01:38:28,841 --> 01:38:30,760
No. It's American.

988
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:34,347
All right,
let me see your name tag.

989
01:38:36,432 --> 01:38:37,642
Is this yours?

990
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:40,478
It's his.

991
01:38:40,936 --> 01:38:42,897
What are your
parents' names?

992
01:38:43,022 --> 01:38:44,065
Lou.

993
01:38:46,692 --> 01:38:48,527
And my mother's name is,

994
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:52,323
um, Eva.

995
01:38:54,033 --> 01:38:56,619
And what are your
parents' dates of birth?

996
01:39:43,331 --> 01:39:45,708
We're gonna have
to get him out of here.

997
01:40:14,695 --> 01:40:16,197
Sure, sure, sure.

998
01:40:16,322 --> 01:40:19,117
What's the other one
on the extension for?

999
01:40:19,659 --> 01:40:20,952
Excuse me.

1000
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:27,166
Some more noise, huh?

1001
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:28,417
Hello.

1002
01:40:30,878 --> 01:40:33,339

Pennsylvania. Right.

1008

I don't want
to go home alone.

1009
01:41:01,117 --> 01:41:02,451
Never mind.

1010
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:06,289
Nothing, nothing, no.
Never mind. Nothing.

1011
01:41:07,248 --> 01:41:08,291
Do you understand?

1012
01:41:08,374 --> 01:41:10,710
I'll give you a call
as soon as I can.

1013

Yeah, yeah.

01:47:14,528 --> 01:47:16,113
Oh, yes, of course.

1080
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:18,282
I gotta go.

1081
01:47:18,699 --> 01:47:20,326
But you must come in.

1082
01:47:22,411 --> 01:47:23,662
I insist.

1083
01:47:26,874 --> 01:47:29,376
What is there to be
afraid of after this war?

1084
01:47:29,877 --> 01:47:31,378
War is a joke.

1085
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:32,755
A silly thing.

1086
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,590
I'm going home, ace.

1087
01:47:34,924 --> 01:47:38,052
<i>Naturellement,
I pay my players. Cash.</i>

1088
01:47:38,552 --> 01:47:39,845
American.

1089
01:47:40,429 --> 01:47:43,891
However, should you
prefer German marks,

1090
01:47:44,224 --> 01:47:47,561
or perhaps Swiss francs, that,
of course, can be arranged.

1091
01:47:47,686 --> 01:47:49,188
I can arrange everything.

1092
01:47:49,271 --> 01:47:50,481
You got the wrong guy, ace.

1093
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:51,732
But you must come in.

1094
01:47:51,857 --> 01:47:53,025
No, don't do that.

1095
01:47:53,150 --> 01:47:54,318
But, I insist.

1096
01:49:14,439 --> 01:49:15,399
Nick!

1097
01:49:37,379 --> 01:49:38,463
Hey, Nick!

1098
01:50:03,196 --> 01:50:04,155
Hey, Nick!

1099
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:10,996
Listen, if you are
really brave and lucky,

1100
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:13,707
I can make you
very, very rich.

1101
01:50:51,577 --> 01:50:53,412
Wow, would you look at that?

1102
01:50:56,039 --> 01:50:58,417
Just keep goin'.
Just keep goin'.

1103
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,918
You said Logan Street though,
man.

1104
01:51:00,002 --> 01:51:02,045
I just wanna keep goin'.
The trailer was right there.

1105
01:51:02,171 --> 01:51:04,256
Wait till Michael
gets here, huh?

1106
01:51:05,174 --> 01:51:07,176
This is it. This is Michael.

1107
01:51:07,259 --> 01:51:08,802
Oh.

1108
01:51:08,927 --> 01:51:12,264
All right, everybody, stay
where you are. Stay right there.

1109
01:51:12,347 --> 01:51:14,391
I'll go get him. I'll go
get him. Everybody stay here.

1110
01:51:14,516 --> 01:51:16,727
Three cheers for the red,
white, and blue!

1111
01:51:16,852 --> 01:51:18,854
Hip, hip, hurray!

1112
01:51:19,021 --> 01:51:21,064
Hip, hip, hurray!

1113
01:51:21,982 --> 01:51:23,567
Hip, hip, hurray!

1114
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,952
That cab ain't stopping.
What's going on?

1115
01:51:39,541 --> 01:51:41,752
I can't wait for him
to see all this.

1116
01:51:41,877 --> 01:51:43,170
What happened?

1117
01:51:43,295 --> 01:51:44,630
Hey, Stosh, what happened?

1118
01:51:44,713 --> 01:51:46,006
I thought it was him.

1119
01:51:46,131 --> 01:51:49,968
So, his plane could be late!
Take it easy will you, Axel?

1120
01:51:50,093 --> 01:51:51,595
You're driving everyone nuts.

1121
01:51:54,598 --> 01:51:55,849
You okay?

1122
01:52:04,274 --> 01:52:06,234
I know Nick
will be back soon.

1123
01:52:07,319 --> 01:52:09,654
I know Nick.
He'll be coming back, too.

1124
01:52:11,323 --> 01:52:12,407
Right, Axel?

1125
01:52:12,491 --> 01:52:13,825
Fucking A.

1126
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:16,995
Go straight on
down to the highway.

1127
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,997
It's your bread, man.

1128
01:55:01,032 --> 01:55:02,367
Hey, wait!

1129
01:56:02,135 --> 01:56:03,470
It's open!

1130
01:56:19,611 --> 01:56:20,987
It's...

1131
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:22,447
Michael.

1132
01:56:23,907 --> 01:56:25,992
Oh, Michael.

1133
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:28,077
Oh.

1134
01:56:28,244 --> 01:56:30,371
Oh, Michael.

1135
01:56:30,455 --> 01:56:31,664
Oh, Michael.

1136
01:56:32,916 --> 01:56:34,375
Oh, Mich-

1137
01:56:36,336 --> 01:56:37,629
Oh, gee.

1138
01:56:38,671 --> 01:56:40,381
Gee, you look beautiful.

1139
01:56:41,758 --> 01:56:43,593
Oh, yeah.

1140
01:56:43,718 --> 01:56:45,595
Let me take your coat.

1141
01:56:45,678 --> 01:56:47,055
Boy,

1142
01:56:47,472 --> 01:56:50,183
everybody was here.
You missed them all. Oh.

1143
01:56:52,101 --> 01:56:55,355
They're gonna be so mad when
they find out they missed you.

1144
01:56:58,942 --> 01:57:00,318
Welcome home.

1145
01:57:07,784 --> 01:57:09,535
You know, I was hopin'-

1146
01:57:10,662 --> 01:57:14,248
I was hopin' somehow, Michael,
maybe you had Nick with you.

1147
01:57:15,124 --> 01:57:16,125
No.

1148
01:57:17,585 --> 01:57:18,544
No.

1149
01:57:26,969 --> 01:57:28,846
Did you hear
anything on Nick?

1150
01:57:31,891 --> 01:57:32,850
No.

1151
01:57:35,853 --> 01:57:39,315
Nothing. He's AWOL.
That's all we know.

1152
01:57:43,402 --> 01:57:44,862
He'll be back.

1153
01:57:45,988 --> 01:57:48,699
He never wrote to me.
He never called me.

1154
01:57:49,325 --> 01:57:50,910
Well, maybe you were out.

1155
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:54,831
Yeah, maybe.

1156
01:58:00,378 --> 01:58:02,004
So how are you, anyway?

1157
01:58:03,339 --> 01:58:05,633
I'm fine, okay.
How are you?

1158
01:58:05,841 --> 01:58:10,053
Uh, me? I'm okay. I'm fine.
I go along, you know.

1159
01:58:10,971 --> 01:58:12,847
Still working at the market.

1160
01:58:14,516 --> 01:58:16,601
There's a million
things to do.

1161
01:58:18,019 --> 01:58:19,354
Y- You sure you're all right,
huh?

1162
01:58:19,437 --> 01:58:20,397
Yeah, I'm all right.

1163
01:58:20,522 --> 01:58:22,357
What about your wounds?

1164
01:58:22,774 --> 01:58:24,359
There's nothing.

1165
01:58:25,235 --> 01:58:27,445
Just the usual complications,
that's all.

1166
01:58:27,529 --> 01:58:28,780
We heard-

1167
01:58:28,863 --> 01:58:31,491
No, that's not true.
A lot of guys go through it.

1168
01:58:31,658 --> 01:58:32,575
Mmm.

1169
01:58:35,912 --> 01:58:38,081
I made Nick that sweater.

1170
01:58:45,255 --> 01:58:47,757
I couldn't remember
the exact size,

1171
01:58:48,466 --> 01:58:51,386
but I think he's about
the same size as you, huh?

1172
01:58:55,056 --> 01:58:57,809
No, too big. Oops.

1173
01:58:59,769 --> 01:59:01,855
Well,
I could fix that, though.

1174
01:59:03,189 --> 01:59:05,859
I mean, one thing about wool,
it's really a cinch...

1175
01:59:09,154 --> 01:59:10,363
to fix.

1176
01:59:12,699 --> 01:59:13,867
Oh, Christ!

1177
01:59:16,452 --> 01:59:17,453
It's okay.

1178
01:59:18,621 --> 01:59:19,831
It's okay.

1179
01:59:24,586 --> 01:59:25,587
It's okay.

1180
01:59:27,505 --> 01:59:28,673
How's your job?

1181
01:59:28,756 --> 01:59:31,009
Great. Fine, yeah.

1182
01:59:32,218 --> 01:59:33,970
Once or twice we
almost had to close.

1183
01:59:34,095 --> 01:59:35,680
I gotta go to work now.

1184
01:59:37,557 --> 01:59:38,725
You gotta go now?

1185
01:59:38,850 --> 01:59:40,018
Yes.

1186
01:59:40,143 --> 01:59:42,437
Uh, would you mind
if I walked you to work?

1187
01:59:46,649 --> 01:59:48,401
Mikey, you're so...

1188
01:59:49,444 --> 01:59:50,445
weird.

1189
01:59:51,654 --> 01:59:53,614
You're always
such a gentleman.

1190
02:00:02,665 --> 02:00:03,750
It's cold out there.

1191
02:00:03,833 --> 02:00:04,792
Yeah.

1192
02:00:04,876 --> 02:00:06,085
I'm not used to it.

1193
02:00:07,462 --> 02:00:09,589
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive.

1194
02:00:10,923 --> 02:00:12,216
I'm so happy.

1195
02:00:15,303 --> 02:00:17,638
I really don't know
what I feel.

1196
02:00:48,377 --> 02:00:49,921
Hello, hi, Mike.

1197
02:01:11,025 --> 02:01:15,529
Linda, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am about Nick.

1198
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:17,823
And how...

1199
02:01:18,741 --> 02:01:20,659
I know how much
you loved him,

1200
02:01:20,743 --> 02:01:23,454
and I know that
it'll never be the same.

1201
02:01:25,039 --> 02:01:27,458
I just wanted
to tell you that.

1202
02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:30,002
Maybe...
I don't know.

1203
02:01:30,086 --> 02:01:32,338
Maybe you don't want
to talk about it.

1204
02:01:48,062 --> 02:01:49,772
How's it going, Hot Lips?

1205
02:01:52,357 --> 02:01:55,276
Yeah, no kidding.
He's a real tough guy.

1206
02:01:57,487 --> 02:01:58,821
It's okay.

1207
02:02:04,077 --> 02:02:05,828
Why don't you
come in with me?

1208
02:02:05,912 --> 02:02:08,831
Just say hello.
Come on. Oh, Mike, please.

1209
02:02:08,915 --> 02:02:10,917
Just say hello.
They want to see you, I know.

1210
02:02:11,042 --> 02:02:13,336
Yeah, just for a second,
okay? Okay.

1211
02:02:13,544 --> 02:02:15,046
Hey, look who's here?

1212
02:02:15,129 --> 02:02:16,172
It's Michael!

1213
02:02:16,256 --> 02:02:18,132
Look who's here.
Hey, everybody.

1214
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:23,096
Oh, Michael, I read about
you in the paper. Oh, Michael.

1215
02:02:23,221 --> 02:02:24,931
Oh, Michael.
Oh, dear.

1216
02:02:25,098 --> 02:02:26,474
Doesn't he look terrific?

1217
02:02:26,599 --> 02:02:29,060
What a nice coat you have.
Hi, Michael.

1218
02:02:29,227 --> 02:02:30,603
Mike.
How beautiful you look.

1219
02:02:30,728 --> 02:02:32,105
You look good, Mike.

1220
02:02:32,188 --> 02:02:33,147
Welcome back.

1221
02:02:33,272 --> 02:02:34,273
Doesn't he
look gorgeous?

1222
02:02:34,399 --> 02:02:35,441
I'm glad he's home.

1223
02:02:35,566 --> 02:02:37,568
Hey, wait a minute.
Look at this. Medals.

1224
02:02:37,652 --> 02:02:38,903
Oh, my god.

1225
02:02:39,028 --> 02:02:40,321
All the medals.

1226
02:02:40,446 --> 02:02:41,656
Congratulations.

1227
02:02:41,781 --> 02:02:43,199
Oh, Michael.

1228
02:02:43,282 --> 02:02:44,492
Oh, Helen, come on.

1229
02:02:44,617 --> 02:02:45,952
Janie, leave me alone.

1230
02:02:47,954 --> 02:02:50,873
We really won over there,
huh, Mike? We won.

1231
02:02:50,957 --> 02:02:52,750
I have to go to work now.

1232
02:02:53,835 --> 02:02:55,670
Good seein' you, Mike.

1233
02:02:56,045 --> 02:02:57,505
See you, Michael.

1234
02:02:57,713 --> 02:03:00,174
Come see us, Michael.

1235
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:03,678
Can I see you later?

1236
02:03:03,803 --> 02:03:04,971
Okay.

1237
02:03:05,096 --> 02:03:06,180
After work?

1238
02:03:06,305 --> 02:03:07,306
Yeah. Where?
Where.

1239
02:03:07,431 --> 02:03:08,975
At home?
At home? Okay.

1240
02:03:40,047 --> 02:03:41,382
One beer at John's. One beer.

1241
02:03:41,507 --> 02:03:42,717
What?

1242
02:03:42,842 --> 02:03:44,760
Come on,
I'll buy you a beer.

1243
02:03:45,886 --> 02:03:47,054
All right, just one.

1244
02:03:47,179 --> 02:03:49,640
Hey, Axel! Hey, Stosh!
Hey, Axel.

1245
02:03:50,307 --> 02:03:51,434
Hey!

1246
02:03:51,517 --> 02:03:53,102
Hey! He-hey!
Look at this!

1247
02:03:53,185 --> 02:03:54,478
How you doing?

1248
02:03:54,562 --> 02:03:56,522
Mikey! Hey, man, how
are you doing? All right.

1249
02:03:56,605 --> 02:03:58,441
Hey, where was you?
Where was you?

1250
02:03:58,524 --> 02:04:00,609
What do you mean, where
was I? Where were you?

1251
02:04:00,693 --> 02:04:02,737
Where was you, when we had
everything all set there.

1252
02:04:02,862 --> 02:04:05,072
The beer...
I'm I right, Axel? Huh?

1253
02:04:05,197 --> 02:04:06,657
I got delayed.

1254
02:04:07,491 --> 02:04:08,743
Something...

1255
02:04:08,868 --> 02:04:09,785
Hey.

Hey, it looks pretty good.

1259

Come on,
we're going to John's.

1262
02:04:23,966 --> 02:04:25,843
So, how have you guys been?

1263
02:04:28,137 --> 02:04:29,513
Hanging in there. You know?

1264
02:04:29,597 --> 02:04:31,682
How does it feel
to be shot?

1265
02:04:31,765 --> 02:04:33,058
It don't.

1266
02:04:33,475 --> 02:04:34,435
Mmm.

1267

It don't hurt, if that's what
you want to know.

1268
02:04:38,564 --> 02:04:40,900
How you been? Been okay?

1269
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:42,526
Yeah.
Yeah.

1270
02:04:43,277 --> 02:04:44,695
Same old thing, you know?

1271
02:04:44,778 --> 02:04:46,572
Nothing's changed.

1272
02:04:46,822 --> 02:04:48,741

than a toilet seat

1273
02:04:48,824 --> 02:04:50,993
and Axel here,
he's getting fatter than ever.

1274
02:04:54,872 --> 02:04:57,041
Hey, Stan, why don't you
show him that gun?

1275
02:04:57,166 --> 02:04:59,084
Shh. Take it easy.

1276
02:04:59,209 --> 02:05:01,462
That little pussy thing you
carry around, look at that.

1277
02:05:01,587 --> 02:05:02,546
Watch it.

1278
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:04,006
What's that for?

1279
02:05:04,089 --> 02:05:05,424
Same thing
the other one was for.

1280

1281
02:05:06,759 --> 02:05:08,344
He's a worrier.

1282
02:05:08,427 --> 02:05:10,721
Ah, forget it. Come on,

02:05:48,382 --> 02:05:50,134
Stosh,
get the glasses on the sink.

1297
02:05:50,259 --> 02:05:51,886
Which ones, the dirty ones?

1298
02:05:52,053 --> 02:05:53,679
Yeah, use the dirty ones.

1299
02:05:54,222 --> 02:05:55,515
Phew, no shit.

Talked to who?

To Steven.

1321
02:06:55,032 --> 02:06:56,450
She talked to Steve?

I didn't know he was back.

Angela wouldn't tell us.

1332

She wouldn't talk to anybody.

I heard Steven was alive.
Where is he?

Nothing.

Just got my gear,

comfort each other?

I'll see you later.

We're goin' huntin', right?

1431
02:16:02,492 --> 02:16:04,327
Who asked you? Who
the hell's asking you?

1432
02:16:04,411 --> 02:16:06,037
I was askin'- askin' Mike.

1433
02:16:06,121 --> 02:16:07,080
Yeah.

1434
02:16:07,205 --> 02:16:08,414
He's goin'.

1435
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:09,707
That's right,
Mike's going.

1436
02:16:09,833 --> 02:16:10,875
But no women.

1437
02:16:10,959 --> 02:16:13,711
Just like old times, hey,
Mike. Mike, right? Am I right?

1438
02:16:13,795 --> 02:16:15,046
Just like old times.

1439
02:16:15,130 --> 02:16:16,673
Fucking A!

1440
02:17:50,182 --> 02:17:52,434
Are you kiddin' me, Axel?

1441
02:17:53,018 --> 02:17:55,186
Forty times
we could've had it,

1442
02:17:57,564 --> 02:17:59,649
if I had been where you are!

1443
02:18:10,285 --> 02:18:11,870
Go get him, Axel!

1444
02:18:16,333 --> 02:18:17,292
Fuck you, guys.

1445
02:18:39,147 --> 02:18:40,940
How sweet it is.

1446
02:18:41,066 --> 02:18:41,983
Fuckin' A.

1447
02:18:43,234 --> 02:18:45,695
Jesus Christ!
What the hell is that?

1448
02:18:49,616 --> 02:18:50,575
Hey!

1449
02:18:51,659 --> 02:18:54,788
Hey! Hey! Hey, John!
Hey, Axel! I got one!

1450
02:18:57,749 --> 02:19:00,251
Hey, fellas, I got one!

1451
02:19:48,966 --> 02:19:50,009
Okay?

1452
02:20:19,914 --> 02:20:24,794
Okay!

1453
02:20:25,753 --> 02:20:30,549
Okay!

1454
02:20:40,058 --> 02:20:42,936
What's that stupid
little gun doin' up here?

1455
02:20:46,314 --> 02:20:47,482
In case.

1456
02:20:47,691 --> 02:20:50,151
In case? In case of what?

1457
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:52,862
In case you stumble
on one of your girlfriends

1458
02:20:52,988 --> 02:20:54,781
sucking on
a forest ranger's cock?

1459
02:20:57,325 --> 02:21:00,078
You say that one more time.
Say it!

1460
02:21:00,745 --> 02:21:02,205
Go on, say it!

1461
02:21:02,288 --> 02:21:04,124
Stanley, you're so
full of shit

1462
02:21:04,207 --> 02:21:05,250
you're gonna float away.

1463
02:21:05,375 --> 02:21:07,502
Try me! You try me! Just
say it! Come on. All right.

1464
02:21:07,627 --> 02:21:09,170
You're gonna float away.

1465
02:21:09,671 --> 02:21:10,672
Easy, Mike.

1466
02:21:13,007 --> 02:21:13,967
Take it easy, Mike.

1467
02:21:14,050 --> 02:21:15,552
What the hell
was that for?

1468
02:21:15,635 --> 02:21:16,886
What, you think
it was loaded?

1469
02:21:17,011 --> 02:21:18,179
Give me that!

1470
02:21:32,402 --> 02:21:33,862
You want to play games?

1471
02:21:33,987 --> 02:21:36,447
All right,
I'll play your fucking games!

1472
02:21:40,410 --> 02:21:41,286
Hey!

1473
02:21:41,411 --> 02:21:44,414
How do you feel now? Huh? Huh?

1474
02:21:45,415 --> 02:21:46,416
Hey!

1475
02:21:46,499 --> 02:21:47,625
Big shot!

1476
02:23:11,918 --> 02:23:13,336
Hi, Michael.

1477
02:23:13,586 --> 02:23:14,587
Linda's in back.

1478
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:15,671
She's in back?

1479
02:23:15,755 --> 02:23:17,006
Yeah, hey,
how was the hunting?

1480
02:23:17,131 --> 02:23:18,507
It was fine, thanks.

1481
02:23:30,519 --> 02:23:32,480
Linda, what's the matter?

1482
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:38,778
I don't know.

1483
02:23:41,113 --> 02:23:42,782
What's the matter?

1484
02:23:43,574 --> 02:23:45,409
Nothing, I don't know.

1485
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,042
Well,
it's gotta be something.

1486
02:23:56,420 --> 02:23:58,255
I got the car outside.

1487
02:23:58,464 --> 02:24:00,216
Yeah. Well, that's okay.

1488
02:24:02,968 --> 02:24:04,011
You sure?

1489
02:24:04,095 --> 02:24:06,555
No, it's okay.
Just leave me alone, okay?

1490
02:24:08,599 --> 02:24:09,725
Really.

1491
02:24:28,826 --> 02:24:30,662
Good night,
see you in the morning.

1492
02:24:30,745 --> 02:24:32,664
Good night, see you tomorrow.

1493
02:24:36,542 --> 02:24:38,753
Come with me.
We'll get you home.

1494
02:24:42,215 --> 02:24:44,092
No, I think
I'll go with him.

1495
02:24:44,175 --> 02:24:45,885
Okay? Thanks.
Okay.

1496
02:24:55,687 --> 02:24:57,105
You okay?

1497
02:25:00,942 --> 02:25:03,653
Did you ever think life
would turn out like this?

1498
02:25:06,823 --> 02:25:07,865
No.

1499
02:27:41,018 --> 02:27:42,853
<i>I-27.</i>

1500
02:27:45,939 --> 02:27:47,107
<i>N-40.</i>

1501
02:27:47,232 --> 02:27:48,317
Bingo.

1502
02:27:48,817 --> 02:27:52,112
<i>We have a bingo,
Johnny come lately.</i>

1503
02:27:52,946 --> 02:27:54,907
<i>Where are you, Johnny?</i>

1504
02:27:54,990 --> 02:27:56,575
<i>There you are.</i>

1505
02:27:56,658 --> 02:27:57,909
B-15.

1506
02:27:57,992 --> 02:27:59,535
<i>Yeah.
I-16.</i>

1507
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:01,287
<i>Right.
N-33.</i>

1508
02:28:01,454 --> 02:28:02,371
<i>Right.</i>

1509
02:28:02,497 --> 02:28:03,456
<i>G-60.</i>

1510
02:28:03,623 --> 02:28:06,125
<i>We have... That's a winner.</i>

1511
02:28:06,292 --> 02:28:07,710
<i>Get out of my road there.</i>

1512
02:28:07,794 --> 02:28:10,922
<i>Ivan Stivan,
I can't see myself smokin'.</i>

1513
02:28:11,005 --> 02:28:14,258
<i>And the next number, I-16.</i>

1514
02:28:14,342 --> 02:28:17,512
<i>Wish it was I,
nice, sweet 16.</i>

1515
02:28:17,637 --> 02:28:20,848
<i>I-18. Then you become a man.</i>

1516
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:23,935
<i>Let's go, men, G-60.</i>

1517
02:28:24,060 --> 02:28:26,562
<i>And those boys that
can't help themselves,</i>

1518
02:28:26,646 --> 02:28:28,564
<i>please, buddy, help them, too.</i>

1519
02:28:28,648 --> 02:28:30,816
<i>Oh, will you dance with me?</i>

1520
02:28:31,192 --> 02:28:33,110
<i>G-47.</i>

1521
02:28:34,028 --> 02:28:37,615
<i>But I'm still satisfied
with what I've got.</i>

1522
02:28:38,199 --> 02:28:40,493
<i>That wonderful life
I've lived.</i>

1523
02:28:40,618 --> 02:28:45,039
<i>Think it over, buddy boys,
and I'll give you O-61.</i>

1524
02:28:51,212 --> 02:28:52,797
Hi, how're you doing?

1525
02:28:56,967 --> 02:28:58,969
Steven,
there's a call for you.

1526
02:28:59,762 --> 02:29:01,639
Maybe it's from Angela.

1527
02:29:30,042 --> 02:29:31,085
Hello.

1528
02:29:31,252 --> 02:29:32,795
<i>Stevie, it's me, Mike.</i>

1529
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:34,338
Michael?

1530
02:29:36,549 --> 02:29:37,508
Michael?

1531
02:29:38,092 --> 02:29:39,093
Hey.

1532
02:29:39,218 --> 02:29:40,511
<i>Hey.</i>

1533
02:29:42,012 --> 02:29:42,930
Hey.

1534
02:29:44,014 --> 02:29:45,432
How's things?

1535
02:29:45,558 --> 02:29:47,851
<i>I'm okay. Never mind me.
How are you?</i>

1536
02:29:49,562 --> 02:29:50,729
Great.

1537
02:29:52,064 --> 02:29:53,065
Great.

1538
02:29:55,693 --> 02:29:57,945
Hey, wha-
hey, what's that noise?

1539
02:29:58,737 --> 02:29:59,822
What?

1540
02:30:00,114 --> 02:30:02,074
Oh, wheelchairs.

1541
02:30:02,783 --> 02:30:03,867
<i>What?</i>

1542
02:30:08,330 --> 02:30:10,040
Hey, Stevie,
when are you gettin' out?

1543
02:30:11,083 --> 02:30:14,003
Uh, I'm gonna stay
here awhile, Mike.

1544
02:30:14,545 --> 02:30:15,713
What for?

1545
02:30:15,921 --> 02:30:17,214
<i>The place is great.</i>

1546
02:30:17,423 --> 02:30:18,382
Huh?

1547
02:30:18,924 --> 02:30:20,592
It's like a resort.

1548
02:30:22,428 --> 02:30:24,638
I mean, they got basketball,

1549
02:30:24,888 --> 02:30:25,848
bowlin'.

1550
02:30:25,931 --> 02:30:27,015
<i>What?</i>

1551
02:30:28,934 --> 02:30:31,854
Princess Grace came to see us
the other day.

1552
02:30:33,856 --> 02:30:35,065
Michael?

1553
02:30:35,149 --> 02:30:36,316
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

1554
02:30:36,525 --> 02:30:37,484
Hey.

1555
02:30:37,818 --> 02:30:39,069
<i>Michael.</i>

1556
02:30:40,237 --> 02:30:41,405
<i>Steve?</i>

1557
02:30:41,947 --> 02:30:43,115
<i>Stevie.</i>

1558
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:45,117
Hey, I gotta go, Mike.

1559
02:30:45,367 --> 02:30:46,452
I gotta go.

1560
02:30:47,035 --> 02:30:47,953
<i>Curfew, man.</i>

1561
02:30:49,121 --> 02:30:50,914
Stevie? Steve?

1562
02:31:57,688 --> 02:31:59,106
Mike?

1563
02:32:01,358 --> 02:32:03,152
Mike. Hey.

1564
02:32:06,363 --> 02:32:08,073
Mike, how are you?

1565
02:32:08,449 --> 02:32:09,325
Hey.

1566
02:32:09,450 --> 02:32:10,409
Hey.

1567
02:32:11,202 --> 02:32:12,203
Michael.

1568
02:32:13,704 --> 02:32:14,705
Hey.

1569
02:32:17,333 --> 02:32:19,210
Good. We made it.
We made it.

1570
02:32:19,585 --> 02:32:20,544
Okay.
Yeah.

1571
02:32:20,628 --> 02:32:22,213
Good.
That's it.

1572
02:32:22,338 --> 02:32:23,297
Hey.

1573
02:32:24,340 --> 02:32:26,050
I don't wanna go home.

1574
02:32:26,217 --> 02:32:27,051
I know.

1575
02:32:27,218 --> 02:32:28,636
Oh, good. Good.
I know.

1576
02:32:28,761 --> 02:32:29,720
Yeah, good.

1577
02:32:29,845 --> 02:32:30,721
I know.

1578
02:32:30,846 --> 02:32:32,014
Really.

1579
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:35,809
You look good.

1580
02:32:35,893 --> 02:32:36,936
Yeah.

1581
02:32:37,269 --> 02:32:39,021
You do any hunting?

1582
02:32:40,064 --> 02:32:42,024
Hunting? Yeah, I did hunting.
Did you get one?

1583
02:32:42,149 --> 02:32:43,651
No, yeah, no, no.

1584
02:32:43,734 --> 02:32:45,361
You didn't get a deer?

1585
02:32:45,486 --> 02:32:47,738
Didn't get anything.
No, I know.

1586
02:32:47,863 --> 02:32:48,739
Oh.

1587
02:32:48,864 --> 02:32:50,532
I was tracking
this beautiful buck

1588
02:32:50,658 --> 02:32:52,159
and it slipped away.

1589
02:32:52,242 --> 02:32:53,243
Oh.

1590
02:32:53,994 --> 02:32:54,953
Oh.

1591
02:32:55,245 --> 02:32:56,747
Angela didn't send you?

1592
02:32:56,872 --> 02:32:57,748
Angela?

1593
02:32:57,873 --> 02:32:58,832
She didn't send you here?

1594
02:32:58,957 --> 02:32:59,833
No.

1595
02:33:00,459 --> 02:33:01,919
Yeah, good.

1596
02:33:02,002 --> 02:33:03,337
I got something
I wanna show you.

1597
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:04,338
What's that?

1598
02:33:04,421 --> 02:33:05,923
I got something here.

1599
02:33:06,924 --> 02:33:08,384
Come here with me
for a minute.

1600
02:33:08,509 --> 02:33:10,469
It's something
I gotta show you.

1601
02:33:10,761 --> 02:33:11,762
Yeah.

1602
02:33:13,013 --> 02:33:15,516
Angela, she keeps
sending me socks.

1603
02:33:16,642 --> 02:33:19,019
It's not socks
I gotta show you, Mike.

1604
02:33:20,104 --> 02:33:22,856
This-This comes
every month from Saigon.

1605
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:24,399
I don't understand.

1606
02:33:25,025 --> 02:33:26,276
I don't understand.

1607
02:33:26,401 --> 02:33:28,695
That place is
gonna fall any day now.

1608
02:33:33,283 --> 02:33:34,910
It's Nicky, Steve.

1609
02:33:36,036 --> 02:33:37,454
Nick's alive?

1610
02:33:39,122 --> 02:33:41,124
Mike? Hey.

1611
02:33:42,543 --> 02:33:43,961
What did you say?

1612
02:33:44,086 --> 02:33:45,420
How do you know?

1613
02:33:47,881 --> 02:33:48,840
Hey.

1614
02:33:49,007 --> 02:33:50,467
That place is
gonna get caught

1615
02:33:50,551 --> 02:33:52,219
in a terrible shitstorm.

1616
02:33:52,761 --> 02:33:55,430
Where's a guy like Nick
get money like this?

1617
02:33:56,932 --> 02:33:58,558
I don't know. Cards, maybe.

1618
02:33:58,642 --> 02:34:01,311
Listen, Steven,
I'm gonna take you home.

1619
02:34:01,436 --> 02:34:03,105
Oh, shit, Mike,
you promised me.

1620
02:34:03,188 --> 02:34:04,439
Stevie, I'm gonna
take you home.

1621
02:34:04,564 --> 02:34:07,275
Come on. I don't fit... You
can't stay here, come on.

1622
02:34:07,401 --> 02:34:08,777
Look... Hey.

1623
02:34:08,860 --> 02:34:10,237
I'm gonna take you home.

1624
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:11,405
Fuck, man.
Look, you promised me, man.

1625
02:34:13,156 --> 02:34:15,283
I don't fit! Michael!

1626
02:34:15,534 --> 02:34:18,120
Hey, I'm sorry.

1627
02:34:18,370 --> 02:34:20,497
You do as your
heart tells you, man.

1628
02:34:53,363 --> 02:34:55,282
We got a Coke machine,
if anybody wants one.

1629
02:34:55,365 --> 02:34:57,450
No, Sergeant,
we're runnin' late.

1630
02:35:02,622 --> 02:35:03,748
Make way!

1631
02:35:07,711 --> 02:35:08,712
Make way!

1632
02:35:15,719 --> 02:35:16,678
Make way!

1633
02:37:07,412 --> 02:37:09,456
Hey, where are you going?

1634
02:37:09,539 --> 02:37:11,416
Are you going to come
with me?

1635
02:38:19,776 --> 02:38:21,027
Do you remember me?

1636
02:38:22,529 --> 02:38:23,863
You remember me?

1637
02:38:27,742 --> 02:38:30,203
You remember Nick?
You remember Nick?

1638
02:38:32,497 --> 02:38:33,540
Where is he?

1639
02:38:33,706 --> 02:38:36,626
I don't know.
Really, I don't know.

1640
02:38:36,751 --> 02:38:38,586
He disappeared
a long time ago.

1641
02:38:41,381 --> 02:38:42,340
Hold on a minute.

1642
02:38:42,465 --> 02:38:43,716
What are you
looking for?

1643
02:38:43,842 --> 02:38:45,468
Nothing to see
anymore here.

1644
02:38:45,593 --> 02:38:46,469
See that?

1645
02:38:46,594 --> 02:38:47,554
What you want?

1646
02:38:47,637 --> 02:38:48,638
I want a game.

1647
02:38:49,931 --> 02:38:51,474
That's for you.

1648
02:38:53,852 --> 02:38:55,395
It's too dangerous now.

1649
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,815
These times are too dangerous
for this kind of game.

1650
02:39:00,733 --> 02:39:03,403
What do you think?
You think I'm afraid of you?

1651
02:39:05,947 --> 02:39:07,864
I want to play the American.

1652
02:39:08,448 --> 02:39:10,617
I'll match him.
Highest stakes.

1653
02:39:21,003 --> 02:39:22,087
Okay.

1654
02:39:23,714 --> 02:39:25,882
How do I know
you know where he is?

1655
02:39:26,300 --> 02:39:28,427
Because I know, that's all.

1656
02:39:28,635 --> 02:39:30,887
But I have to take you
by the river.

1657
02:39:44,526 --> 02:39:47,738
Only because I feel
comfortable with the whites.

1658
02:40:49,257 --> 02:40:50,300
We are.

1659
02:40:50,425 --> 02:40:52,886
You like change your mind?
There's still time.

1660
02:41:14,866 --> 02:41:16,284
Come on.

1661
02:41:28,671 --> 02:41:29,923
Wait here.

1662
02:41:54,113 --> 02:41:56,074
He said we have
to pay to go inside.

1663
02:41:56,199 --> 02:41:57,116
How much?

1664
02:41:57,283 --> 02:41:58,159
$1,000.

1665
02:41:58,952 --> 02:42:00,453
Tell him I'm coming up.

1666
02:42:35,154 --> 02:42:37,323
He said, yes, the famous
American is inside.

1667
02:42:37,448 --> 02:42:40,493
You have to give him $500 more
for this information.

1668
02:44:22,677 --> 02:44:24,178
Where's Nick?
I don't know.

1669
02:44:24,304 --> 02:44:25,889
What do you mean?
Where is he?

1670
02:44:26,014 --> 02:44:27,599
We have to go ask the boss.

1671
02:44:39,193 --> 02:44:40,903
Hey, Nick.

1672
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:43,281
Are you all right?

1673
02:44:43,448 --> 02:44:44,741
Nick, it's me.

1674
02:44:46,034 --> 02:44:48,244
Nick. Hey. Hey.

1675
02:44:49,579 --> 02:44:52,415
What you're doing? Nick?
What you're... Oh.

1676
02:44:52,498 --> 02:44:53,916
What you're doing?

1677
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,127
Nicholas, what's the matter?

1678
02:44:56,294 --> 02:44:58,087
Get over there.
Get over there.

1679
02:45:02,091 --> 02:45:03,885
Do you know it's me?
It's Mike.

1680
02:45:03,968 --> 02:45:05,303
Tell me, "it's Mike."

1681
02:45:05,470 --> 02:45:06,804
Tell me, "it's Mike."
It's Mike.

1682
02:45:06,929 --> 02:45:08,222
Tell me, "it's Mike."
It's Mike.

1683
02:45:08,306 --> 02:45:09,682
Mike. Mike who?

1684
02:45:10,057 --> 02:45:11,976
Mike who? Hey, Mike who?

1685
02:45:12,435 --> 02:45:14,103
"Mike who?" I don't know.

1686
02:45:19,317 --> 02:45:22,653
Nicholas, I came 12,000 miles
back here to get you.

1687
02:45:23,988 --> 02:45:26,240
Don't do that to me,
I'll fucking... Don't do it.

1688
02:45:26,324 --> 02:45:28,951
Don't do it. Don't do it.
What's the matter with you?

1689
02:45:29,076 --> 02:45:31,162
Don't you recognize me? Huh?

1690
02:45:31,287 --> 02:45:33,581
Don't you recognize me? Huh?

1691
02:45:37,043 --> 02:45:38,336
Nicky, I love you.

1692
02:45:38,461 --> 02:45:40,796
You're my friend,
what are you doing?

1693
02:45:52,099 --> 02:45:53,809
How could you fucking
do this to me?

1694
02:45:53,935 --> 02:45:55,436
You fucking...

1695
02:45:58,564 --> 02:46:00,232
Did you hear what I said?

1696
02:46:00,358 --> 02:46:01,942
Come here,
you fucking guinea.

1697
02:46:09,075 --> 02:46:10,034
<i>Salut.</i>

1698
02:46:21,879 --> 02:46:23,339
How much?

1699
02:46:23,672 --> 02:46:25,966
"How much?"
This is how much.

1700
02:46:32,723 --> 02:46:34,433
Here, you count it.

1701
02:46:44,818 --> 02:46:45,777
C'mon, why not?

1702
02:46:46,945 --> 02:46:48,196
Why not?

1703
02:46:50,198 --> 02:46:51,699
I don't want this money.

1704
02:46:51,824 --> 02:46:52,867
You don't want the money?

1705
02:46:52,951 --> 02:46:54,202
Here, take it,
take that, too.

1706
02:46:54,369 --> 02:46:55,662
Tell him, go ahead.

1707
02:47:48,005 --> 02:47:49,340
We don't have much time.

1708
02:47:49,465 --> 02:47:51,342
We don't have
much time, Nick.

1709
02:48:18,369 --> 02:48:19,787
Don't do it.

1710
02:48:58,367 --> 02:48:59,994
Is this what you want?

1711
02:49:01,495 --> 02:49:02,997
Is this what you want?

1712
02:49:13,549 --> 02:49:14,842
I love you, Nick.

1713
02:49:29,023 --> 02:49:30,274
Nicholas.

1714
02:49:50,961 --> 02:49:52,963
Come on, Nicky, come home.

1715
02:49:53,589 --> 02:49:55,716
Just come home. Home.

1716
02:49:58,594 --> 02:49:59,928
Talk to me.

1717
02:50:00,679 --> 02:50:02,473
Look, Nicholas,
talk to me.

1718
02:50:08,187 --> 02:50:09,688
Nicky. Nicky.

1719
02:50:11,273 --> 02:50:13,859
Wait a minute.
What did you do to your arms?

1720
02:50:15,110 --> 02:50:16,570
Nicky, you remember the trees,

1721
02:50:16,695 --> 02:50:18,196
all the different ways
in the trees.

1722
02:50:18,363 --> 02:50:20,323
Remember that?
Remember? Huh?

1723
02:50:21,783 --> 02:50:24,285
The mountains.
You remember all that?

1724
02:50:25,495 --> 02:50:26,454
One shot.

1725
02:50:26,579 --> 02:50:28,164

02:50:32,210 --> 02:50:33,169
