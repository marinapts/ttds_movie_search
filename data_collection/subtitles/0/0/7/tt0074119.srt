Okay, let me know what happens.
Hello, Carl.

73
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:45,801
Got anything on that couple?

74
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:48,263
Harry, I know somebody on the staff
over at Watergate.

75
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,728
Bernstein, why don't you finish one story
before trying to get on another?

76
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:53,232
I finished it.

77
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:55,527
-The Virginia Legislature story?
-I finished it.

78
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:57,280
All right, give it to me.

79
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:00,244
I'm just polishing it. I'll work the phones.

80
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:02,708
Polishing it? Yeah, you work the phones.

81
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:12,142
Excuse me, I'm sorry, who are the lawyers
for the five men arrested at Watergate?

82
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,310
Do you know?

83
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:15,815
-Well, these two were assigned to it.
-I'm sorry?

84
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:18,236
These two were appointed to the case.

85
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,492
But only now it turns out
the burglars have their own counsel.

86
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,787
-The burglars have their own counsel?
-That's right.

87
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,916
That's kind of unusual, wouldn't you say?

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,670
For burglars it's unusual.

89
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:31,469
-You know the name of the counsel?
-I don't know. Some country-club type.

<i>I'm Bob Woodward

-Markham.
-Markham.

98
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:02,526
Mr. Markham, are you here in connection
with the Watergate burglary?

99
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,863
I'm not here.

100
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,247
Okay.

101
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,839
Well, clearly, I am here...

102
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:17,428
but only as an individual,
not as the attorney of record.

103
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:18,723
Who is?

104
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:20,893
Mr. Starkey.

105
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,483
-Do you have any--
-Whatever you want...

106
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,990
you'll have to get it from him.
I have nothing more to say.

107
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,845
Starkey. S-T-....

108
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,148
Mr. Starkey was very helpful.

109
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:49,613
Four Cuban Americans
and another man, James W. McCord.

110
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:53,537
Look, I told you inside,
I have nothing more to say.

111
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:55,290
I understand that.

112
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,838
What I don't understand is
how you got here.

113
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:02,637
I assure you there's nothing
very mysterious involved.

114
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:05,601
Well, a little while ago, I was talking
to a couple of the lawyers...

115
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:07,480
assigned to represent the burglars.

116
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,649
So?

117
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,320
They never would have been assigned
to represent the burglars...

118
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,325
had anyone known the burglars
had arranged for their own counsel.

119
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:16,997
Only, the burglars couldn't have arranged
for their own counsel...

120
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:19,502
since they never even made a phone call.

121
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,967
So, if no one asked you to be here,
why are you here?

122
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,763
I don't want you
to take this personally, Mr....

123
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,349
-Woodward.
-Woodward.

124
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,687
It'd be a mistake to do that.

125
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:32,568
I just don't have anything to say.

126
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:47,428
Did one of the other men
involved in the break-in call you?

127
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,936
What reason do you have to assume
that there were other people involved?

128
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,984
Well, one of your clients
was arrested with a walkie-talkie.

129
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,737
They're not my clients.

130
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,993
Now, I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

131
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,414
You're a lawyer and you're here.

132
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:07,841
One of the defendants, Mr. Barker,
and I met at a social occasion once.

133
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:11,097
-Where?
-I have nothing else to say.

134
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:12,266
A Miami social occasion?

135
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,979
Mr. Starkey says
the Cubans were from Miami.

136
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:17,776

137
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:19,655

00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:30,132
Please step forward, Attorney Starkey.

142
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:32,220
All charged with Burglary 2.

143
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:37,896
-Mr. Starkey, will you represent all five?
-Yes, Your Honor.

144
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,194
And are all five gentlemen charged
with burglary, second degree?

145
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:42,363
Yes, Your Honor.

146
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:45,076
JUDGE: Your names, please,
and state your professions.

147
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:48,332
Bernard Barker, anti-communist.

148
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,883
Anti-communist?
That, sir, is not your average profession.

149
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:58,643
James McCord, security consultant.

150
00:11:58,768 --> 00:11:59,937
JUDGE: Where?

151
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:02,985
Government. Recently retired.

152
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:07,200
-Where in the government?
-[Whispering] Central Intelligence Agency.

153
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,829
Where?

154
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,373
The CIA.

155
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,130
Sturgis, Frank A., salvage operator.

156
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:16,051
Holy shit!

157
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,016
Eugenio Martinez, known as Gene Valdez.

158
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:22,395
James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin.

159
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,358
Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini.

160
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:26,319
All five of them had at least one alias.

161
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:29,450
Is there any proof they were trying to bug
the National Democratic Chairman?

162
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,287
It's obvious
they were trying to bug O'Brien.

163
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,374
They wouldn't go to all that trouble
to bug secretaries.

164
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,752
-There's no proof.
-Wait a minute.

165
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:36,088
I called a lawyer in Miami I know.

166
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,842
He said four of the guys
who were arrested were from Miami...

167
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,305
Gonzales, Martinez, Sturgis, and Barker.

168
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,145
Yeah, Barker. And all four of them
were involved in CIA activities....

169
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,816
-No, they weren't.
-Yeah.

170
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,114
No, only one of them was admitted CIA,
and the CIA won't confirm that.

171
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:52,117
In fact, they deny even knowing McCord.

172
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,456
Yeah, but I just think it's obvious that
with all that money and equipment...

173
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,213
they weren't out to work by themselves.
Somebody hired them.

174
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:01,092
I'm not interested
in what you think is obvious.

175
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:02,303
I'm interested in what you know.

176
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:05,141
What we don't know is why they wanted
to bug Democratic Headquarters.

177
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:06,769
Whether they were working
for themselves...

178
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,522
or other individuals or other organizations.

179
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:10,568
Could be a story,
or could just be crazy Cubans.

180
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:12,780

take it easy.

181

You know, I'm glad
you asked me that question.

213
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:55,136
The reason I'm glad you asked me
is because...

214
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,599
if you had asked Simons or Bradlee,
they would've said:

215
00:14:57,682 --> 00:15:01,564
"You know we're going to have to fire this
schmuck at once because he's so dumb! "

216
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,527
Who is Charles Colson?

217
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,534
The most powerful man
in the United States is President Nixon.

You've heard of him?

219

Were they modern, or were they period--

<i>What kind of information?</i>

270
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:41,485
It's just profile information mostly.

271
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:43,990
We know, for example,
that he works for Mullen & Company...

272
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:47,998
or did work for Mullen & Company
as a writer. He's also a novelist.

273

Mr. Charles Colson at the White House.

<i>And the CIA.</i>

275

<i>If you're conducting
that kind of investigation...</i>

277
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:02,691
<i>then certainly it comes as no surprise
to you that Howard was with the CIA.</i>

278
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:04,862
No, no surprise at all.

279
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,537
Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970.

280
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,042
From '49 to '70.
Now, this is on deep background...

281
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,588

he's involved with the break-in.

What else you got?

283
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:17,385
According to White House personnel...

284
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,723
Hunt definitely worked there
as a consultant for Colson.

285
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:23,313
That's Charles Colson,
the President's Special Counsel.

286
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:25,024
Did you call the White House Press Office?

287
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:26,485
I went over there. I talked to them.

288
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:29,115
They said Hunt hadn't worked there
for three months.

289
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,870
Then a PR guy said this weird thing to me.

290
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:36,003
He said, "I'm convinced
that neither Mr. Colson...

291

00:18:50,154 --> 00:18:52,032
I never asked about Watergate.

297
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,999
I simply asked what were Hunt's duties
at the White House.

298
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,922
They volunteered he was innocent
when nobody asked if he was guilty.

299
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,096
Be careful how you write it.

300
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,939
Looks like we've got a White House
consultant linked to the bugging.

301
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,402
Harry, this isn't a police story anymore.
This is national.

302
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,196
We need a top political writer on it.

303
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,950
Well, they don't want it.

304
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,371
They're all over the goddamned map

Besides, this guy has busted his ass.

306

He's been on this paper
for only nine months.

307
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,883
-What's the matter with you?
-He's a humper!

308
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:26,262
What's he been writing about,
rat shit in restaurants?

309
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:28,850
-He's got no experience.
-He got a few of them closed, didn't he?

310
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,562
Minor incidents.
Small government agencies.

00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:37,408

316
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:43,711
I read that cockamamie memorandum
he wrote on the break-in.

317
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:46,132
All right, so some of it was bullshit.

318
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:47,803
What is the matter with you?

319
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,891
You told me yourself
you were going to fire him last month.

320
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,274
Look, he wants on the story bad.
They both do!

-How's it going?
-What are you doing?

327
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:48,317
-Polishing it a little.
-What?

328
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,111
-Polishing it.
-What's wrong with it?

329
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:51,865
Nothing. Nothing. It's good.

330
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:53,201
Then what are you doing with it?

331
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,955

00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:06,308
-May I have it, please?
-Some of the conclusions--

338
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,312
-May I have it?
-Yes. I'm not looking for a fight.

339
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:09,731
I'm not looking for a fight, either.

340
00:22:09,815 --> 00:22:13,112
I'm just aware of the fact that
you've only been here nine months.

341
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:14,782
What's that got to do with anything?

342
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:16,285
I've been in the business since I'm 16.

343
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,454
What are you saying?

344
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:20,251
I'm trying to tell you that
if you'd read mine and then read yours....

345
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,004
-May I read yours?
-Yeah.

346
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,051
I walked by, gave yours a glance,
it didn't look right...

347
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,721
so I just figured I'd refine it a little.

348
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,683
The first paragraph
has to have more clarity...

349
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:30,228
if the reader's going to understand it.

350
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:33,233
You don't mention Colson's name
till the third paragraph.

351
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:35,320
I think mine's better.
But you go ahead and read it.

352
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:37,575
If you think yours is better,
we'll give yours to the desk.

353
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,704
I've got Colson's name up front.

354
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:43,001
He's a White House consultant
and nobody knows it.

355
00:22:43,084 --> 00:22:44,546
You're right.

356
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:46,800
Yours is better.

357
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:00,617
If you're going to do it, do it right.
Here are my notes.

358
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,746
If you're going to hype it,
hype it with the facts.

359
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:05,835
I don't mind what you did.
I mind the way you did it.

360
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:08,965
Woodward. Bernstein.

361
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,471
You're both on the story.
Now don't fuck it up.

362
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:21,239
CARL: Steuben, what's the name of
that girl that you bombed out with...

363
00:23:21,322 --> 00:23:23,826
-that works in Colson's office?
-Sharon Lyle.

364
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:27,750
SHARON: Why are you looking at me
like that?

365
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:29,212
CARL: You're attractive.

366
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:32,550
You are very attractive.

367
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,557
You know, my girlfriend told me
to watch out for you.

368
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,852
-Who?
-I'm not giving any names.

369
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,401
Steuben said you worked for Colson.

370
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:46,911
Steuben's crazy.
I never worked for Colson.

371
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:48,289
That's what he said.

372
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:52,421
I worked for an assistant.
Colson was really big on secrets, anyway.

373
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:56,554
Even if I had worked for him,
I wouldn't know anything!

374
00:23:58,348 --> 00:24:02,023
Did you know Howard Hunt?
Didn't he work in the office?

375
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,400
Yeah, I knew Howard.

376
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,779
-Nice?
-He's a nice person.

377
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,286
He's secretive, he is secretive,
but a decent man.

378
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:12,249
Do you have any idea what he did?

379
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,925
The White House said
he was doing some investigative work.

380
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:18,302
What do you say?

381
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:19,972
[Sharon chuckling]

382
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:22,769
-He was doing investigative work.
-On what?

383
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:27,277
-Different things.
-Like what?

384
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:30,450
She warned me.

385
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:33,205
I'm not going to take my book out.
I'm just asking you.

386
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,922
The scuttlebutt for a while was that
he was investigating Kennedy.

387
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:39,132
Go on.

388
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:42,264
The White House was real paranoid
about Teddy Kennedy.

389
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:47,314
I remember seeing a book about
Chappaquiddick on his desk.

390
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:50,320
And he was always getting material
out of the White House Library...

391
00:24:50,404 --> 00:24:53,534
and the Library of Congress,
and anything he could find.

392
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:57,500
<i>RECEPTIONIST: White House Library.</i>

393
00:24:57,584 --> 00:24:59,880
<i>Hi, this is Carl Bernstein
of the Washington Post...</i>

394
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:02,092
and I was just wondering
if you can remember...

395
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:06,141
any books that a Howard Hunt
checked out on Senator Kennedy?

396
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:07,936
<i>-Howard Hunt?
-Yes, ma'am.</i>

397
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,110
<i>Yes, I think I do remember.</i>

398
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,740
<i>He took out a whole lot of material.</i>

399
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:18,748
<i>-Why don't you hold on and I'll see?
-I sure will. Thank you very much.</i>

400
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:33,733
<i>-Mr. Bernstein?
-Yes, ma'am?</i>

401
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:36,447
<i>-I was wrong.
-I beg your pardon?</i>

402
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,081
<i>The truth is, I don't have a card
that says Mr. Hunt took any material.</i>

403
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,587
<i>I don't remember getting material for....</i>

404
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:47,717
<i>I do remember getting material
for somebody, but it wasn't for Mr. Hunt.</i>

405
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:49,095
All right.

406
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:53,645
<i>The truth is, I didn't have any requests
at all from Mr. Hunt.</i>

407
00:25:57,277 --> 00:26:00,032
<i>The truth is, I don't know any Mr. Hunt.</i>

408
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:09,132
I was just wondering
if you have any books.... Hello?

409
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:15,978
BOB: Yes,
we're checking that information now.

410
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:18,984
We'd just like to find out
just what it was that Hunt did...

411
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:22,532
when he worked out as a White House
consultant on the Pentagon Papers.

412
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:24,285
Yes, I'd appreciate that, if you could.

413
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:26,372
Yes, sir. Thank you.

414
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:28,501
I just got off the phone
with the White House librarian.

415
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:30,839
You want to look at the notes on it?

416
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:36,182
This is some stuff from
the Eisenhower campaign in 1952...

417
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:38,519
that Hunt was connected with.

418
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,778
Did you call the
White House Communications Office?

419
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:45,240
No, I just got off the phone
with the librarian.

420
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,622
-524-743.
-I know the number.

421
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,756
Between the first and second quote
there's a complete contradiction.

422
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,385
It's a space of about five seconds.

423
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:56,679
-My feeling is--
-Was this all....

424
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:57,889
<i>SECRETARY: Mr. Clawson's office.</i>

425
00:26:57,972 --> 00:26:59,725
<i>This is Bob Woodward
of the Washington Post.</i>

426
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,356
<i>-Could I talk to Mr. Clawson, please?
-One moment, please.</i>

427
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,733
Thank you.

428
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:06,238
When she came back
she said she didn't even know--

429
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:08,784
<i>-Ken Clawson.
-Mr. Clawson, this is Bob Woodward.</i>

430
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:11,414
<i>Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post
had a conversation...</i>

431
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,001
with a White House librarian...

432
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:16,549
on some books a Mr. Howard Hunt
took out on Senator Edward Kennedy.

433
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:20,055
She first said that Howard Hunt
had taken out books on Senator Kennedy...

434
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,393
and then she denied even knowing
who he was.

435
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,314
I was wondering if you'd like to comment
on this confusion.

436
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:27,652
<i>Listen, let me call you back on this matter.</i>

437
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:30,616
<i>-I'm going to check on it for you.
-All right, thank you. Bye.</i>

438
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,994
-Call back?
-Yes.

439
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:34,123
-This was all one conversation?
-Yeah.

440
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:37,211
She says first of all,
"I think I got a bunch of books on Hunt."

441
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:40,384
She comes back five seconds later, she
says, "I don't even know a Mr. Hunt."

442
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:41,636
It's obvious someone got to her.

443
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,183
Not enough proof.
I mean, if there was just a piece of paper...

444
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:47,355
that said that Hunt was taking out books
on Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.

445
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,150
Like a.... I don't know, library slip.

446
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,237
Hunt also took out books
from the Library of Congress...

447
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,494
but what's more important is that
somebody got to her in that space of time.

448
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:57,165
-How do you know somebody got to her?
-Because she said that Hunt....

449
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:59,085
There was a lot of books
that Hunt checked out.

450
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:01,173
And then she comes back
and she don't even know him.

451
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:04,178
<i>-Woodward.
-Mr. Woodward, Ken Clawson calling back.</i>

452
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:07,142
<i>-I've just talked with the librarian.
-Yes, sir.</i>

453
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:11,483
<i>She denies that the conversation
with Mr. Bernstein ever took place.</i>

454
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,947
<i>She said she referred him
to the Press Office.</i>

455
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,033
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you say
she denies even knowing...

456
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:17,870
about the conversation taking place?

457
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:22,838
<i>That's right. She said someone
did call her asking about Mr. Hunt...</i>

458
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:25,718
<i>but all she did was refer him
to the Press Office...</i>

459
00:28:25,802 --> 00:28:27,012
<i>and she denies that...</i>

460
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,475
<i>-any other conversation took place.
-Total bullshit.</i>

461
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,773
<i>-I hope that's been of some help to you.
-Thank you.</i>

462
00:28:36,488 --> 00:28:39,953
-We've got to get something on paper.
-The Library of Congress.

463
00:28:41,914 --> 00:28:43,000
BOB: Mona?

464
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:45,922
Excuse me, Mona, could you take
any calls for me, please?

465
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:47,675
-Sure.
-Here's my note.

466
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:50,431
If I get any calls....

467
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:54,104
-Will you be back later?
-I don't know when.

468
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:11,803
You want all the material
requested by the White House?

469
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:15,101
All White House transactions
are confidential.

470
00:29:16,228 --> 00:29:18,232
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

471
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,791
-We need a sympathetic face.
-We're not going to find one here.

472
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,254
You want every request since when?

473
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,926
CARL: When did he start?
BOB: July of '71.

474
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:35,012
CARL: I imagine the whole last year.

475
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:40,022
I'm not sure you want them,
but I've got them.

476
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,419
Maybe they pulled the cards.

477
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,881
Maybe they changed the names.

478
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:42,011
There might have been a card there,
and we missed it.

479
00:30:42,304 --> 00:30:43,807
Hey, wait a minute.

480
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:47,814
I met a White House aide once
at a social occasion.

481
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:50,277
-So?
-He might confirm.

482
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:55,161
BOB: Do we need W.H. in White House?
CARL: Not in the second paragraph.

483
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:57,331
-I don't think we do. Do we?
-White House will be enough.

484
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:59,419
-White House.
-Just use White House. Forget the W.H.

485
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:02,007
I want to know about Colson.
What was his job at the White House?

486
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:05,096
-Special consultant to the President.
-I gotta say it.

487
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:10,105
These notes on the White House librarian,
are they accurate?

488
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:13,695
The White House librarian,
the notes, are they accurate?

489
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:15,574
Yeah, but I wanna hear him say it.

490
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:39,409
-Okay, let's have it.
-Here you are, Ben.

491
00:31:39,743 --> 00:31:42,332
It's a good, solid piece
of American journalism...

492
00:31:42,415 --> 00:31:45,003
<i>that the New York Times doesn't have.</i>

493
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:10,174
You haven't got it.

494
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,429
A librarian and a secretary saying
Hunt looked at a book.

495
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:13,597
That's not good enough.

496
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,979
A White House aide told me
that Hunt was investigating Kennedy.

497
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:18,189

00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,212
"to deal with what we call a 'dock strike."'

823
00:54:40,295 --> 00:54:41,631
Breaking it off...

824
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:42,925
[All laughing]

825
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:44,887
I'll give you a human interest.

826
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:46,975
"Thirty-one days of rain
in the Philippines...

827
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:49,521
"is being blamed on the theft
of a statue of Jesus."

828
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:51,442
We had one like that before.

829
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,742
-I'll put my best writer on that.
-What about the one in lndia?

830
00:54:57,034 --> 00:54:59,999
Laugh, gentlemen,
it'll be the only story everyone reads.

831
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:01,251
Okay, National?

832
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:04,799
We have the Bremer diary.
"Wish to kill Nixon."

833
00:55:04,882 --> 00:55:08,514
He took a car trip to New York,
Ottawa, and Washington to kill him.

834
00:55:09,266 --> 00:55:12,271
We have the "Senate approving
the ABM Treaty."

835
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:13,733
ABM.

836
00:55:13,816 --> 00:55:16,863
Of course, we have
"McGovern offering the VP spot..."

837
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:18,450
to everybody.

838
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:19,869
-Yeah, that's news.
-I have--

839
00:55:19,952 --> 00:55:21,330
Because everybody's been offered it.

840
00:55:21,413 --> 00:55:25,504
Now, I'll tell you what will be news.
When somebody accepts it. That's news.

841
00:55:25,796 --> 00:55:27,716
Here is some great art.

842
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:32,475
McGovern and Humphrey at breakfast,
smiling their asses off.

843
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,187
Isn't that great?

844
00:55:34,646 --> 00:55:38,152
-He says, "I am George's friend..."
-Why is that man smiling?

845
00:55:39,029 --> 00:55:40,698
Sounds friendly. Very friendly.

846
00:55:40,783 --> 00:55:43,663
"I'll be helping him in ways
he never dreamed possible."

847
00:55:43,746 --> 00:55:45,542
Breakfast followed by lunch.

848
00:55:47,628 --> 00:55:48,880
Okay. Metro?

849
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:51,427
Well, we got the schoolteachers
on Capitol Hill.

850
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:55,726
They want a 17% increase in pay
or this fall they go on strike.

851
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,941
Harry, I think we could mention
that this might be the time...

852
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:01,571
to go to the front page
on the district home rule.

853
00:56:01,654 --> 00:56:03,533
-Oh, come on!
-Listen to him.

854
00:56:03,616 --> 00:56:06,496
Ben, this time it could go all the way.

855
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,585
The House is going to vote next week
on a Senate resolution.

856
00:56:09,669 --> 00:56:12,173
Okay then, well, when they pass it,
we'll run with it.

857
00:56:12,257 --> 00:56:14,678
Okay, fellas,
let's go around again now. Foreign?

858
00:56:15,221 --> 00:56:16,932
Taiwan emergency, Philippines.

859
00:56:17,016 --> 00:56:18,393
Okay, fine. National?

860
00:56:18,477 --> 00:56:20,063
I'll stand on the Eagleton follow-ups...

861
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:21,900
McGovern not being able
to get a replacement.

862
00:56:21,984 --> 00:56:24,864
He's offered it to Humphrey, Kennedy,
and Ribicoff. All turned him down.

863
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:26,241
That's the Page 1 lead right there.

864
00:56:26,325 --> 00:56:29,080
You're ignoring the importance
of the Dahlberg repercussions.

865
00:56:29,164 --> 00:56:31,376
Nobody cares about
the Dahlberg repercussions.

866
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,089
Now look, it was our story
that got the General Accounting Office...

867
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:36,177
to start an audit with CREEP Finance.

868
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,766
We printed that didn't we? When the
frigging audit's done, we'll print that, too.

869
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,728
Let me tell you what happened today.

870
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:44,400
I was having lunch
at the Sans Souci, and...

871
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,117
this White House guy, a good one, a pro...

872
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:52,624
came up and asked me, "What is this
Watergate compulsion with you guys?"

873
00:56:52,707 --> 00:56:55,962
Compulsion? This is a story.
This is not compulsion.

874
00:56:56,255 --> 00:56:58,718
I said, "Well, we think it's important."
And he said:

875
00:56:58,802 --> 00:57:02,642
"If it's so goddamn important, who in
the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?"

876
00:57:02,725 --> 00:57:04,813
Now, what do you expect him to say
from the White House?

877
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:06,232
"You're doing a great job"?

878
00:57:06,315 --> 00:57:08,820
Why don't you ask him
what he's really saying?

879
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:11,283
He wants to take the story away
from Woodstein and...

880
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:13,495
-give it to his National desk.
-At least I have...

881
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:16,126
some experienced guys sitting around
who know the politicians...

882
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:18,379
-who have the contacts.
-We're aware of that.

883
00:57:18,547 --> 00:57:20,258
You said it. Sitting around.

884
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:23,806
Ben, it's a dangerous story for this paper.

885
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:27,813
-What if your boys get it wrong?
-Then it's our ass, isn't it?

886
00:57:27,898 --> 00:57:30,360
We all have to go out
and work for a living.

887
00:57:31,194 --> 00:57:33,198
National gets eight columns.

888
00:57:33,282 --> 00:57:34,909
Nine for Foreign.

889
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,205
Metro, 15.

890
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:39,711
That's it, fellas.

891
00:57:44,052 --> 00:57:46,223
Hey, Scott, I need to see you.

892
00:57:48,477 --> 00:57:49,520
How dangerous?

893
00:57:54,863 --> 00:57:58,788
Well, it's not just that we're using
unnamed sources that bothers me...

894
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:02,294
or that everything we print,
the White House denies...

895
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:05,967
or that almost no other papers
are reprinting our stuff.

896
00:58:06,051 --> 00:58:07,387
What then?

897
00:58:07,845 --> 00:58:10,309
Look, there are over 2,000 reporters
in this town...

898
00:58:10,393 --> 00:58:12,521
are there five on Watergate?

899
00:58:13,314 --> 00:58:16,946
<i>Where did the Washington Post
suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom?</i>

900
00:58:18,115 --> 00:58:20,119
Why would the Republicans do it?

901
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:25,002
McGovern is self-destructing, just like
Humphrey, Muskie, the bunch of them.

902
00:58:27,173 --> 00:58:29,010
I don't believe their story.

903
00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:32,057
It doesn't make sense.

904
00:58:34,228 --> 00:58:35,564
Yeah, Bernstein.

905
00:58:36,399 --> 00:58:37,985
Now? All right.

906
00:58:38,402 --> 00:58:40,949
Woodward, Bradlee will see us now.

907
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:42,493
Answer the phone for me, will you?

908
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:45,750
Are you trying to find the
lowest possible common denominator....

909
00:59:04,743 --> 00:59:06,204
Ben, it's the hottest item.

910
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:07,916
-It's in over 500 papers.
-What is it?

911
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:10,044
Yesterday's weather report
for people who were drunk...

912
00:59:10,127 --> 00:59:11,379
and slept all day.

913
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,548
Jesus! Send it out...

914
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,469
<i>to the San Francisco Chronicle.
They need it.</i>

915
00:59:14,552 --> 00:59:15,930
-How about the crossword puzzle?
-No.

916
00:59:16,013 --> 00:59:17,265
Anagrams?

917
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:19,979
-No space, Mickey.
-Goodbye.

918
00:59:20,313 --> 00:59:22,776
The last thing you bought
from me was the obituaries.

919
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,738
-Make him buy something, will you?
-All right.

920
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:26,282
Hey, what do you guys want?

921
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:29,372
The GAO report's due out
the morning of Nixon's renomination.

922
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:30,791
Sit down.

923
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:33,462
Well, that's two weeks from now.

924
00:59:34,214 --> 00:59:36,008
Since they're only responsible
to Congress...

925
00:59:36,092 --> 00:59:39,014
there's no way the White House
can control the investigation.

926
00:59:39,098 --> 00:59:41,436
There's a source over
at General Accounting that tells us...

927
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,984
there's a whole rat's nest
of illegal shit going on over at CREEP.

928
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:46,904
-Like what?
-Like a slush fund.

929
00:59:46,988 --> 00:59:49,659
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
of unaccounted-for cash.

930
00:59:49,742 --> 00:59:51,328
Hundreds of thousands of dollars?

931
00:59:51,412 --> 00:59:52,665
Any comment from CREEP?

932
00:59:52,749 --> 00:59:55,086
Yes. Unavailable for comment.
They're not talking.

933
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,634
But what else besides the money?
Where's the goddamn story?

934
01:00:00,554 --> 01:00:02,516
The money's the key to whatever this is.

935
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,144
-Says who?
-Deep Throat.

936
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:06,440
-Who?
-Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak...

937
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:08,152
his source in the executive--

938
01:00:08,235 --> 01:00:11,992
Garage freak? Jesus, what kind of a crazy,
fucking story is this?

939
01:00:12,618 --> 01:00:14,038
Who did you say?

940
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:19,882
He's on deep background.
I call him "Deep Throat."

941
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:23,054
Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing...

942
01:00:23,137 --> 01:00:25,058
Nixon's guaranteed the renomination...

943
01:00:25,141 --> 01:00:27,187
<i>and the Post is stuck
with a story no one else wants.</i>

944
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,856
lt'll sink the goddamn paper.

945
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,403
Everyone says, "Get off it, Ben."
And I come on very sage...

946
01:00:31,486 --> 01:00:34,325
and I say, "You'll see.
You wait till this bottoms out."

947
01:00:34,408 --> 01:00:37,706
But the truth is,
I can't figure out what we've got.

948
01:00:40,378 --> 01:00:42,005
What else are you working on?

949
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,051
We're after a list of CREEP employees.

950
01:00:44,135 --> 01:00:46,347
-Where is it?
-It's classified.

951
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:49,687
-How are you gonna get it?
-We haven't had any luck, yet.

952
01:00:50,062 --> 01:00:51,231
Get some.

953
01:00:56,616 --> 01:00:57,952
Anything else?

954
01:01:07,928 --> 01:01:10,057
You made a mistake in there.

955
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:14,774
What?

956
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:17,112
You said to Brad
that we haven't had any luck yet...

957
01:01:17,196 --> 01:01:19,868
and that's the thing that he jumps on.
You can't talk about luck.

958
01:01:19,951 --> 01:01:23,624
If you can't talk in specifics,
you shouldn't say anything.

959
01:01:28,842 --> 01:01:30,763
Is there any place you don't smoke?

960
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:35,188
-What?
-Hold it.

961
01:01:35,563 --> 01:01:37,734
-What're you doing?
-Kay Eddy.

962
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:40,864
BOB: Doesn't she go with a guy that
works for the Committee to Re-Elect?

963
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:42,785
<i>KAY: The E.R.
MAN: All right.</i>

964
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:45,122
-Eddy? Hey. Kay, can--
-Just a second.

965
01:01:45,707 --> 01:01:49,589
<i>-757-6521.
-Okay, I'll get back to you on this, thanks.</i>

966
01:01:50,675 --> 01:01:54,265
Don't you go with a guy that works
for the Committee to Re-Elect?

967
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,061
-Not anymore.
-You did go with him, though.

968
01:01:57,144 --> 01:01:58,982
I think you were engaged to him,
weren't you?

969
01:01:59,065 --> 01:02:01,153
-Yeah.
-You got out of it?

970
01:02:02,613 --> 01:02:04,909
-So?
-You're looking better.

971
01:02:07,831 --> 01:02:09,918
Look, we need a list of the people
that work there.

972
01:02:10,002 --> 01:02:11,714
Do you think that....

973
01:02:11,797 --> 01:02:13,883
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

974
01:02:14,927 --> 01:02:16,179
It's personal.

975
01:02:16,264 --> 01:02:18,727
What do you mean? You said it was over.

976
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,986
You're asking me to use a guy
I care about.

977
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:25,614
CARL: No.
We're not asking you to use him...

978
01:02:25,698 --> 01:02:26,782
Well, sure--

979
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:29,330
CARL: ...just to help us.
I mean, we'd do the same for you.

980
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:31,709
My only chance of getting that story
is if I see him.

981
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:33,628
I don't want to see him again.

982
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:36,050
-Do you have to see him?
-Sure, I have to see him.

983
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:37,470
No. Do you have to see him that way?

984
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,306
Can't you just call him up
on the telephone...

985
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:41,644
and say you want to have
a drink with him, just feel him out?

986
01:02:41,727 --> 01:02:45,484
You say the relationship is over.
What the hell do you have to lose?

987
01:02:46,361 --> 01:02:47,696
Forget it.

988
01:02:48,323 --> 01:02:50,702
We don't want you to do anything
that would embarrass you...

989
01:02:50,786 --> 01:02:53,290
or that you don't feel right about.

990
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,336
Forget it.

991
01:03:04,018 --> 01:03:07,024
Don't let her just get off.
I think she was going to say something.

992
01:03:07,108 --> 01:03:09,737
You just overdramatized it,
she was going to give us what we want.

993
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:10,906
It's over.

994
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,409
-What?
-It's over.

995
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,870
CARL: Is this the whole list?

996
01:03:58,953 --> 01:04:02,627
BOB: Look what it says. "Personnel,
Committee to Re-Elect the President."

997
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:07,302
CARL: This is all in alphabetical order.
You can't tell who works for who.

998
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:10,432
BOB: Well, find out the department heads
like Mitchell, Magruder, Stans.

999
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:11,769
CARL: Here. John Mitchell.

1000
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:13,438
BOB: What's the number?
CARL: 301.

1001
01:04:13,522 --> 01:04:16,068
BOB: All right. Find somebody
who has a number close to it.

1002
01:04:16,193 --> 01:04:17,822
BOB: They probably work for him.
CARL: There's a 303.

1003
01:04:17,905 --> 01:04:19,032
Okay.

1004
01:04:21,328 --> 01:04:25,002
<i>CARL: We have to find out how the money
got from Maurice Stans to the burglars.</i>

1005
01:04:25,085 --> 01:04:27,131
<i>BOB: Somebody who worked in Finance.</i>

1006
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,846
<i>CARL: All right. Here's the head of Finance.
Maurice Stans, 269.</i>

1007
01:04:30,929 --> 01:04:33,851
<i>BOB: If we can just get somebody
who works under Stans.</i>

1008
01:04:34,644 --> 01:04:36,690
<i>CARL: Sloan? You need him?
BOB: He's the treasurer.</i>

1009
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:38,819
<i>BOB: What's the number?
CARL: Hugh Sloan, 287.</i>

1010
01:04:38,902 --> 01:04:40,697
<i>BOB: Is there a secretary?</i>

1011
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:45,539
<i>BOB: Wait a minute. Manley.
Here it is. lrene Manley?</i>

1013
01:04:49,212 --> 01:04:51,467
-Hi, I'm Bob Woodward.
-I'm Carl Bernstein.

1014
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:52,677
<i>We're from the Washington Post.</i>

1015
01:04:52,761 --> 01:04:55,057
We'd like to know if we could
speak to you for a few minutes.

1016
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,604
We understand your daughter works
for the Committee to Re-Elect.

1017
01:04:57,729 --> 01:05:00,859
-Wouldn't be anything embarrassing.
-Would you object to just--

1018
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:04,115
-Yes?
-Hi.

1019
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:05,618
Miss Milland? Betty Milland?

1020
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,497
-I'm Bob Woodward.
-Carl Bernstein.

1021
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,916
<i>We're from the Washington Post.</i>

1022
01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:11,755
I know you're trying to do your job.
I mean....

1023
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:14,468
You don't understand
the pressure that we're under.

1024
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:17,724
It'll just take a couple of seconds.
If we can just come in for a couple of--

1025
01:05:17,808 --> 01:05:19,602
-No, I really don't--
-We don't want to come in.

1026
01:05:19,686 --> 01:05:21,523
We understand that there was
some documents...

1027
01:05:21,606 --> 01:05:23,443
that were shredded at the Committee.

1028
01:05:23,527 --> 01:05:24,946
Well, there....

1029
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,659
There's often shredding. We do that a lot.

1030
01:05:27,742 --> 01:05:30,038
-Were you there during the shredding?
-Yes, I was.

1031
01:05:30,122 --> 01:05:32,751
I see.
Were there any department heads from...

1032
01:05:32,835 --> 01:05:34,547
the Committee who were also present?

1033
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,176
Yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night.

1034
01:05:37,468 --> 01:05:39,639
John Mitchell? The Attorney General?

1035
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:43,062
He was carrying a raincoat over his head.

1036
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,485
I thought he was going to go....

1037
01:05:47,112 --> 01:05:48,823
Did he supervise the shredding?

1038
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:52,538
Can I not answer any more questions?
I'd just soon not....

1039
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:54,667
Okay? Maybe I could call you?

1040
01:05:55,919 --> 01:05:59,176
-Are you being told not to talk?
-Will you call us?

1041
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,221
I don't know.

1042
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:02,807
I'll try.

1043
01:06:02,932 --> 01:06:05,395
What about all that shredding
that took place after the break-in?

1044
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,524
Need to know more about the papers
that were in shredding.

1045
01:06:07,608 --> 01:06:09,235
I think you've some idea
what's in the papers...

1046
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:11,198
when the former Attorney General
comes to the office...

1047
01:06:11,281 --> 01:06:12,993
when it's taking place
at the Committee to Re-Elect...

1048
01:06:13,076 --> 01:06:15,038
and got a raincoat over his head.
Why's he in a raincoat?

1049
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:16,583
Could be raining
is what could've happened.

1050
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:17,835
Let me go through the story again.

1051
01:06:17,919 --> 01:06:20,256
You got a woman who's frightened
at the door. Works for CREEP.

1052
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:23,471
She said there's shredding taking place.
We don't know what's in the papers.

1053
01:06:23,554 --> 01:06:26,643
We know the former Attorney General
comes in with an overcoat over his head.

1054
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,438
It could be raining.
There's a lawyer present.

1055
01:06:28,522 --> 01:06:30,776
We don't know what he asked them.
She wouldn't talk about it.

1056
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:32,654
Now, will you please tell me
where there's a story?

1057
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:35,993
There's a story in the fact that the
interview did not take place in her home...

1058
01:06:36,077 --> 01:06:37,706
but in the office
of the Committee to Re-Elect.

1059
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:39,333
How's there a story in that?
It's not enough!

1060
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:41,420
There's a story
because there's a lawyer in the office.

1061
01:06:41,504 --> 01:06:43,591
-I mean, you're more resistant than she is.
-That's right.

1062
01:06:43,675 --> 01:06:45,636
-Why?
-Because there's not enough fact.

1063
01:06:46,555 --> 01:06:49,769
<i>CARL: Let's just turn around and go back
and question her again.</i>

1064
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:54,611
-This won't take long at all. We just want--
-Please go away, okay?

1065
01:06:54,695 --> 01:06:57,158
Will you please leave before they see you.

1066
01:06:57,659 --> 01:07:00,414
-Who did you mean by--
-Who do you mean, "they"?

1067
01:07:00,747 --> 01:07:02,460
Could you give us their names?

1068
01:07:02,543 --> 01:07:06,049
We haven't revealed the sources
of people that have talked to us.

1069
01:07:07,009 --> 01:07:09,138
You know, I really can't talk
about this because--

1070
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:11,601
Would "they" be members
of the Committee?

1071
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:16,234
<i>CARL: Someone got to that woman.</i>

1072
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:17,863
<i>It's the key to the whole cover-up.</i>

1073
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:19,616
<i>How can you write that
there's a cover-up?</i>

1074
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:21,161
<i>We don't know that there's a cover-up!</i>

1075
01:07:21,244 --> 01:07:23,164
Well, then, I don't know
what the hell you need.

1076
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,460
So, you tell me what you need.

1077
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,839
I need more fact for a story
is what I need...

1078
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:29,551
and I think you should
need the same thing.

1079
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:31,429
Okay, if you get in the car...

1080
01:07:31,512 --> 01:07:34,185
and there's music playing
in the car, hypothetically.

1081
01:07:34,268 --> 01:07:36,271
There's music playing in the car
for 10 minutes...

1082
01:07:36,355 --> 01:07:38,902
and there's no commercial.
What can you deduce from that?

1083
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:40,530
-Is it AM or FM?
-Come on, Bernstein!

1084
01:07:40,613 --> 01:07:41,865
Is it AM or FM?

1085
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:45,705
A guy can come up to me on the street
and he can ask me an address.

1086
01:07:45,998 --> 01:07:48,920
Now, is the man interrogating me,
or is he lost?

1087
01:07:49,003 --> 01:07:50,381
What kind of a story do I write?

1088
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:52,385
What kind of a deduction
do I make from that?

1089
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,766
Because you don't have a gut feeling
that the woman is trying to help us?

1090
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,729
No, I don't have enough gut feeling
and I wish I did.

-It's almost like there's a pattern...</i>

1097

01:08:33,794 --> 01:08:36,842
A friend of the Committee said
that we could contact you.

-Who was it?
-We can't reveal that.

You think you can come into my home,
ask a few questions...

1107
01:08:48,071 --> 01:08:52,579
have me destroy the reputations
of men that I work for and respect?

1108
01:08:54,249 --> 01:08:56,294
Do you understand loyalty?

1109
01:08:56,671 --> 01:08:58,715
Have you ever heard of loyalty?

1110
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,304
-Hi.
-Yes?

I've read what you've written.
I want to thank you.

1115
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:13,034
I've been a Republican all my life,
but this goes beyond party politics.

1116
01:09:13,118 --> 01:09:15,664
Would you mind if we asked you
a few questions?

1117
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:18,335
No. Come in. Would you like coffee?

1118
01:09:19,379 --> 01:09:20,506
Sure.

1119
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:23,721
What they've done
is a threat to the Constitution.

1120
01:09:23,804 --> 01:09:26,142
It goes against everything we stand for.

1121
01:09:26,225 --> 01:09:29,022
Could you be a little bit more specific
than that?

1122
01:09:29,105 --> 01:09:31,902
I'm afraid your articles
have just scratched the surface.

1123
01:09:31,986 --> 01:09:34,824
You don't mind if I just take a few notes,
do you?

1124
01:09:34,907 --> 01:09:35,993
No.

Yes, the Committee

1128
01:09:45,344 --> 01:09:49,059
Oh, I don't work at the Committee
to Re-Elect the President.

1129

past the point when you believe it?

that's unnatural.

-Hughes got a call from Stans in Florida.

who wanted to tell the truth
but some people wouldn't listen.

Certain people have gone back

to give information
which they were never asked.

1206
01:14:43,436 --> 01:14:47,193
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when
he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance...

1207
01:14:47,277 --> 01:14:49,740
and we were just wondering if you were...

promoted to work for Mr. Stans
immediately after Mr. Sloan quit...

1209

or whether there was some time lapse?

1210

I was just curious why you lied just then.

01:15:56,279 --> 01:15:59,369

if you tell the truth?

1220
01:16:00,412 --> 01:16:01,498
No.

-Just milk.

-Thanks.
-Okay, I'll just get that.

1224
01:16:08,886 --> 01:16:12,935
I saw in the wires
that Mrs. Stans was in the hospital.

1225
01:16:13,018 --> 01:16:14,897
Is she feeling better?

1226
01:16:19,948 --> 01:16:23,204
The GAO, the General Accounting
Report said that...

1227
01:16:24,081 --> 01:16:28,714
there was $350,000 in the safe of
the Committee to Re-Elect the President.

1228
01:16:29,758 --> 01:16:33,515
Were you aware that it was that kind
of funds from the very beginning?

01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:40,987
A lot of people are watching me.
They know I know a lot.

1230
01:16:41,572 --> 01:16:43,325
Was it all in $100 bills?

1231
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:45,287
A lot of it was.

1232
01:16:46,623 --> 01:16:49,336
I thought it was
an all-purpose, political fund...

1233
01:16:49,418 --> 01:16:52,425
you know, for taking fat cats to dinner,
things like that.

1234
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:54,471
$350,000 for dinners?

1235
01:16:57,226 --> 01:16:58,895
How was it paid out?

1236
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:05,157
Not in one big chunk.

1237
01:17:07,285 --> 01:17:09,832
There was a list of 15 names
and the amount of money...

1238
01:17:09,957 --> 01:17:12,253
given to each person next to the name.

1239
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,841
What happened to the list?

1240
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:19,767
It was destroyed. It was the only record.

1241
01:17:21,813 --> 01:17:24,860
Don't pay attention to this.
This is for my memory.

1242
01:17:27,532 --> 01:17:29,535

1243
01:17:30,745 --> 01:17:32,541
You won't be quoted by name.

1244
01:17:32,624 --> 01:17:35,797
In fact, we get confirmations
before we print anything.

1245
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,341
I can't be...

1246
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:40,681
positive that that money was used
for the break-in, you understand?

1247
01:17:40,764 --> 01:17:42,100
Yes, I do.

1248
01:17:42,517 --> 01:17:45,440
-But, people sure are worried.
-Which people?

1249
01:17:52,202 --> 01:17:56,209
Think you could help me
with the disbursement of money...

1250
01:17:56,293 --> 01:18:00,049
in terms of the number of people
that were involved? How many?

1251
01:18:02,764 --> 01:18:05,519
A group of them. About five.
I don't know their names.

1252
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:08,148
Would Mr. Sloan know?

1253
01:18:13,115 --> 01:18:16,163
-Would he--
-I don't want to say anymore, okay?

1254
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:27,350
I won't be much longer.

1255
01:18:29,563 --> 01:18:33,194
I wondered if you could just
help me a little bit about...

1256
01:18:33,987 --> 01:18:36,827
the money. We hear all kinds of figures.

1257
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:44,215
-There's so much of it.
-How much is "so much"?

1258
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:47,763
In one two-day period, $6 million came in.

1259
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,520
-Six!
-Six million, cash.

1260
01:18:53,732 --> 01:18:55,903
We didn't know where to put it all.

1261
01:18:57,072 --> 01:19:00,412
I thought it was all legal.
I mean, I guess I did until...

1262
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:03,709
after the break-in when I remembered
Gordon got so much of it.

1263
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:06,339
-This is Mr. Liddy?
-It's all so rotten.

1264
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:09,762
It's getting worse.

1265
01:19:10,764 --> 01:19:13,311
And the only one I care about
is Hugh Sloan.

1266
01:19:13,936 --> 01:19:18,111
His wife was going to leave him if he
didn't stand up and do what was right.

1267
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,906
So, he quit.

1268
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:22,995
I was wondering...

1269
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:29,382
if Hugh Sloan was being set up now
as a fall guy for John Mitchell.

1270
01:19:30,634 --> 01:19:32,053
What do you think?

1271
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,741
If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful.

1272
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,343
Coffee's cold.

1273
01:19:55,638 --> 01:19:57,600
Is there any evidence that...

1274
01:19:58,769 --> 01:20:01,148
any of Mr. Mitchell's assistants...

1275
01:20:02,944 --> 01:20:04,530
were part of this?

1276
01:20:05,031 --> 01:20:08,955
I had all the evidence. It was destroyed.
I don't know who destroyed it.

1277
01:20:09,247 --> 01:20:12,378
-I think Gordon did a lot of shredding.
-Hard evidence?

1278
01:20:12,461 --> 01:20:16,552
Well, I can't say that it would positively
prove that they planned the break-in...

1279
01:20:16,635 --> 01:20:18,681
but it would come pretty close.

1280
01:20:18,973 --> 01:20:22,312
Can you tell me anything
about who got the money?

1281
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:25,444
We have...

1282
01:20:25,986 --> 01:20:29,326
had some help on this
from a couple of sources...

1283
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,332
and this is a way of confirming it.

1284
01:20:35,922 --> 01:20:37,966
I don't want you to feel
that you're in a position...

1285
01:20:38,049 --> 01:20:40,095
where you have to disclose names.

1286
01:20:40,304 --> 01:20:42,600
I can just ask you initials...

1287
01:20:43,226 --> 01:20:46,316
and then that way you're not
divulging any information.

1288
01:20:47,317 --> 01:20:50,031
We have some idea.
Would that be all right?

1289
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:56,501
Was there an "M"?

1290
01:20:59,715 --> 01:21:01,636
Can you just nod either way?

1291
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:04,891
Did it go that high up?

1292
01:21:08,983 --> 01:21:10,110
"L"?

1293
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,117
I don't want to say any more, okay?

1294
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,497
I'm sorry. You said "L"...

1295
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,834
or...I get confused.

was going on inside that woman.

1299

trying to get it out of her...

1301
01:21:30,064 --> 01:21:31,316

1302
01:21:31,441 --> 01:21:33,194
-Give me your notes so--
-These are the notes.

1303
01:21:33,277 --> 01:21:35,573
-These are the notes?
-I've got stuff on napkins, matchbooks--

1304
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:37,827
I'm writing in the bathroom
while she's getting coffee.

1305
01:21:37,911 --> 01:21:39,706
-I'm a walking litter basket!
-You're crazy.

1306
01:21:39,789 --> 01:21:42,335
You'd be crazy, too,
if you were operating on 20 cups of coffee.

1307
01:21:42,461 --> 01:21:44,215
Could you give me something
I can get down?

1308
01:21:44,298 --> 01:21:45,550
I got it. I got it all.

1309
01:21:45,675 --> 01:21:47,094
Okay. Write.

01:21:47,261 --> 01:21:49,641
-Mitchell was in control.
-Wait a minute.

1311
01:21:50,393 --> 01:21:52,396
-There were men working under Mitchell--
-How many?

1312
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,651
I don't know how many,
but the men working under Mitchell...

1313
01:21:54,734 --> 01:21:56,403
received the money from the slush fund.

1314
01:21:56,487 --> 01:21:57,989
Do we know how much money?

1315
01:21:58,073 --> 01:22:00,244
We're talking about
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1316
01:22:00,327 --> 01:22:03,082
And these men are the key
to what that money was used for.

1317
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,627
Boy, that woman was paranoid.

1318
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:07,550
At one point, I suddenly wondered
how high up this thing goes...

1319
01:22:07,633 --> 01:22:09,177
and her paranoia finally got to me.

1320
01:22:09,261 --> 01:22:11,640
I thought what we had was so hot,
that any minute CBS or NBC...

1321
01:22:11,723 --> 01:22:13,644
would come in through the windows
and take the story away.

1322
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:14,813
You're both paranoid.

1323
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:17,317
She's afraid of John Mitchell,
you're afraid of Walter Cronkite.

1324
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,530
-Right.
-Can we go back to what she said?

1325
01:22:20,949 --> 01:22:23,036
Here. "L," "P," and "M."

1326
01:22:24,455 --> 01:22:26,208
-What do you mean?
-It's "L," "P," and "M".

1327
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:28,128
-She'd only give initials.
-lnitials?

1328
01:22:28,212 --> 01:22:31,635
The initials are the name of the men that
worked under Mitchell. "L," "P," and "M."

1329
01:22:31,718 --> 01:22:33,556
You couldn't get the names?

1330
01:22:34,933 --> 01:22:37,021
If I could've gotten the names,
I would've gotten the names!

1331
01:22:37,104 --> 01:22:38,732
I'm with the woman,
trying to get anything I can.

1332
01:22:38,815 --> 01:22:40,986
She said "L," "P," and "M,"
that's all she would give me...

1333
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:42,822
are the people who worked under Mitchell.

1334
01:22:42,906 --> 01:22:45,661
She said something about Mitchell.
She hates him.

1335
01:22:45,745 --> 01:22:47,164
She said, "John Mitchell....

1336
01:22:47,247 --> 01:22:49,626
"If you guys could get John Mitchell,
that would be beautiful."

1337
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:52,214
Wait a minute, what's this here?
What are you writing about Sloan?

1338
01:22:52,299 --> 01:22:54,344
"Sloan was the treasurer
of the Committee to Re-Elect.

1339
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:57,058
"His wife is pregnant and she made
Sloan quit because apparently...

1340
01:22:57,141 --> 01:22:58,727
"he no longer wanted to be a part of it."

1341
01:22:58,811 --> 01:22:59,979
We've got to go see Sloan.

1342
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:02,525
Okay. Make a note of it.
So, what have we got?

1343
01:23:02,609 --> 01:23:03,861
Where's that matchbook?

1344
01:23:03,986 --> 01:23:05,155
-Here.
-"L," "P," and "M."

1345
01:23:05,239 --> 01:23:06,492
Okay, "L," "P," and "M."

1346
01:23:06,617 --> 01:23:09,371
-"L" could be La Rue. It could be Liddy.
-"L" is Liddy.

1347
01:23:09,455 --> 01:23:11,375
-How do we know that?
-Because she said it.

1348
01:23:11,459 --> 01:23:13,922
Right here.
She said, "At the time of the break-in...

1349
01:23:14,005 --> 01:23:15,716
"there was so much money
floating around...

1350
01:23:15,801 --> 01:23:17,220
"that I know Gordon got part of it."

1351
01:23:17,303 --> 01:23:19,349
So I said, "You mean Gordon Liddy?"
She said, "Yes."

1352
01:23:19,432 --> 01:23:21,729
So, "L" is Liddy.
Okay, that leaves "P" and "M."

1353
01:23:21,812 --> 01:23:23,356
"P" could be...

1354
01:23:24,023 --> 01:23:27,363
Parkinson. It could be Porter. It could be--

1355
01:23:27,446 --> 01:23:30,494
Wait a minute! There was a guy once.
There was a guy we talked to last week.

1356
01:23:30,578 --> 01:23:32,289
Didn't he say
that there was a Bart Porter...

1357
01:23:32,373 --> 01:23:34,376
who at one time was
a member of the Committee to Re-Elect?

1358
01:23:34,459 --> 01:23:36,421
Porter was called before
the Grand Jury investigation.

1359
01:23:36,505 --> 01:23:38,091
So "P" is definitely Porter.

1360
01:23:38,175 --> 01:23:39,428
"P" could be Porter.

1361
01:23:39,553 --> 01:23:42,600
"P" is Porter, "L" is Liddy.
All that leaves is "M"!

1362
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:45,647
"M" could be McCord? That's out.

1363
01:23:46,106 --> 01:23:48,110
It could be Mardian.

1364
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:50,114
It could be...

1365
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:52,493
-Magruder!
-I think it's Magruder.

1366
01:23:52,577 --> 01:23:54,831
-I think it's Magruder, too.
-Why do you think it's Magruder?

1367
01:23:54,914 --> 01:23:56,500
Because he was second in command
under Mitchell.

1368
01:23:56,584 --> 01:23:57,669
Why do you think it's Magruder?

1369
01:23:57,795 --> 01:24:00,174
Because at one time
he was a temporary head...

1370
01:24:00,257 --> 01:24:02,303
of the Committee to Re-Elect,
before Mitchell.

1371
01:24:02,387 --> 01:24:03,472
I don't want a cookie.

1372
01:24:03,555 --> 01:24:05,684
We've got to get that bookkeeper
to say it was Magruder.

1373
01:24:05,768 --> 01:24:07,145
Never get her to say anything about "M."

1374
01:24:07,228 --> 01:24:09,858
We have got to go back there
and try to get her to say it.

1375
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:13,198
If we could make names of the initials...

1376
01:24:13,365 --> 01:24:15,702
then we'll know the people at CREEP
who paid off the burglars.

1377
01:24:15,786 --> 01:24:18,458
We'll at least know who got the money.

1378
01:24:20,169 --> 01:24:23,050
The indictments that came down
from the Grand Jury today...

1379
01:24:23,133 --> 01:24:24,302
stopped...

1380
01:24:25,011 --> 01:24:27,557
with the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.

1381
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:30,188
Carl, we have got to go back there
and get that bookkeeper...

1382
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:32,149
to say who the names are and not initials.

1383
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:33,485
She ain't going to give it to you...

1384
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,030
because I was with the woman
for six hours.

1385
01:24:35,114 --> 01:24:37,410
-We have to try.
-Then you'll have to trick her, threaten her.

1386
01:24:37,493 --> 01:24:39,204
-She's not going to do it.
-Wait a minute.

1387
01:24:39,287 --> 01:24:41,417
-You know what we could do?
-What?

1388
01:24:44,297 --> 01:24:46,677
-Listen, we go back there...
-Yeah.

1389
01:24:47,303 --> 01:24:49,556
-...and you ask her who "P" is.
-Yeah.

1390
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,352
And then I say, "No, don't worry about it...

1391
01:24:51,436 --> 01:24:53,022
"we know 'P' is Porter." I just bury it.

1392
01:24:53,105 --> 01:24:55,317
Okay. Now, wait a minute.
I say to her, "Who is 'P'?"

1393
01:24:55,401 --> 01:24:58,365
-And then you say to me--
-I say, "No, we know 'P' is Porter."

1394
01:24:58,448 --> 01:25:00,201
-You mean, you try to fake her out?
-Right.

1395
01:25:00,285 --> 01:25:02,916
-And what if she denies it?
-We're screwed.

1396
01:25:02,999 --> 01:25:05,002
-So?
-But if she doesn't, we know we got it.

1397
01:25:05,086 --> 01:25:07,381
-We know "P" is Porter.
-Try it.

1398
01:25:16,815 --> 01:25:17,901
Hi.

1399
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:19,613
They'll see you.

1400
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,660
Not if you let us in, they won't.

1401
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,330
And I'm Bob Woodward.

1402
01:25:24,414 --> 01:25:27,711
-They'll see your car.
-We parked around the corner.

1403
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:31,176
You have answers
for everything, don't you?

1404
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:33,806
If we did, we wouldn't be here.

1405
01:25:36,018 --> 01:25:37,270
You wrote what I told you.

1406
01:25:37,354 --> 01:25:39,399
Oh, no. Not your name.
No one knows it was you.

1407
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:41,694
Could you tell us who got the money?

1408
01:25:42,321 --> 01:25:43,824
And how much?

1409
01:25:44,784 --> 01:25:48,040
You mean like, "What did you do
with the $25,000, lady?"

1410
01:25:48,332 --> 01:25:49,501
What?

1411
01:25:50,336 --> 01:25:53,383
Little jokes they're making
down at Finance these days.

1412
01:25:54,343 --> 01:25:55,721
If people are to be convinced...

1413
01:25:55,804 --> 01:25:58,977
that Stans and Sloan are innocent,
then our reporting must be precise...

1414
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:00,689
and you can help us.

1415
01:26:00,772 --> 01:26:01,858
Who is "P"?

1416
01:26:01,941 --> 01:26:04,779
"P" we know, is Porter.
You said, "$25,000."

1417
01:26:05,196 --> 01:26:07,325
Is that how much Porter got?

1418
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,627
Was it more?

1419
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:19,724
Was it more than $50,000?

1420
01:26:23,397 --> 01:26:26,235
Was Magruder the only "M"
to receive money?

1421
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:35,878
Who told you about Porter?

1422
01:26:37,715 --> 01:26:39,761
<i>TV INTERVIEWER: I'd like to move on now...</i>

1423
01:26:39,844 --> 01:26:42,223
<i>to the subject of the break-in
at the Watergate...</i>

1424
01:26:42,474 --> 01:26:44,895
<i>and the controversies
that keep coming up out of that.</i>

1425
01:26:44,978 --> 01:26:48,193
<i>It has recently,
very recently been reported now, that...</i>

1426
01:26:48,277 --> 01:26:49,946
<i>some documents were torn up...</i>

1427
01:26:50,029 --> 01:26:52,410
<i>at the Committee
to Re-Elect the President.</i>

1428
01:26:52,535 --> 01:26:55,831
<i>Are you investigating the tearing up
of those documents--</i>

1429
01:26:55,915 --> 01:26:58,629
<i>ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think that came out
in a story in the Washington Post.</i>

1430
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:00,675
<i>-Yes.
-I think the investigation...</i>

1431
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:02,552
<i>that has just concluded itself...</i>

1432
01:27:02,636 --> 01:27:04,932
<i>has probably been
one of the most intensive...</i>

1433
01:27:05,016 --> 01:27:08,772
<i>that the Department of Justice
and the FBI has ever been involved in.</i>

1434
01:27:08,855 --> 01:27:10,985
<i>Some 1,500 persons were interviewed...</i>

1435
01:27:11,068 --> 01:27:15,410
<i>1,800 leads were followed,

01:27:15,493 --> 01:27:17,205
<i>14,000 man-hours...</i>

1437
01:27:17,705 --> 01:27:21,171
<i>fifty-one of the 59 FBI field officers
were involved.</i>

1438
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,052
<i>And that, I think...</i>

1439
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,684
<i>is a great credit to justice in this country.</i>

1440
01:27:28,767 --> 01:27:30,938
<i>Did you know
that documents had been destroyed?</i>

1441
01:27:31,022 --> 01:27:32,149
<i>No, I did not.</i>

1442
01:27:35,029 --> 01:27:38,536
All these neat little houses
and all these nice little streets.

1443
01:27:39,078 --> 01:27:43,420
It's hard to believe that something's
wrong in some of those little houses.

1444
01:27:43,879 --> 01:27:45,339
No, it isn't.

1445
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:49,139
-Hello, I'm Carl Bernstein.
-Bob Woodward.

1446
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:52,353
We'd just like to talk to Mr. Sloan
for a couple of minutes.

1447
01:27:52,437 --> 01:27:55,400
-He's resting right now.
-Are you Mrs. Sloan?

1448
01:27:56,861 --> 01:27:59,950
<i>-You're the two from the Post, aren't you?
-Yes.</i>

1449
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:02,121
This is an honest house.

1450
01:28:02,205 --> 01:28:05,001
That's why we'd like to see your husband.

1451
01:28:05,251 --> 01:28:07,506
Faced with certain criminal charges
that might be brought...

1452
01:28:07,589 --> 01:28:09,760
against some people that are innocent,
we just feel that--

1453
01:28:09,843 --> 01:28:11,764
It's really for his benefit.

1454
01:28:11,848 --> 01:28:13,309
No, it's not.

1455
01:28:16,773 --> 01:28:19,111
No, it's not.

1456
01:28:19,361 --> 01:28:22,075
SLOAN: Deborah, tell them to come in.

1457
01:28:22,408 --> 01:28:23,494
Thanks.

1458
01:28:23,619 --> 01:28:26,082
-Hi, Carl Bernstein.
-How do you do? Hugh Sloan.

1459
01:28:26,207 --> 01:28:27,584
-Bob Woodward.
-How are you doing?

1460
01:28:27,668 --> 01:28:30,215
I appreciate you giving us the time.

1461
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,524
You know, the reason
that we're here, basically...

1462
01:28:39,607 --> 01:28:41,444
is that we've talked
to certain people who...

1463
01:28:41,527 --> 01:28:43,656
have indicated that the reason
you left the Committee...

1464
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:46,203
was because you no longer
want to be part of it.

1465
01:28:46,286 --> 01:28:48,332
Yeah, right. Maybe there's
a legitimate explanation...

1466
01:28:48,415 --> 01:28:51,671
why the money was handed
to Liddy and Mitchell's aides.

1467
01:28:54,886 --> 01:28:56,805
Try to understand this.

1468
01:28:58,183 --> 01:29:00,395
-I'm a Republican.
-I am, too.

1469
01:29:00,687 --> 01:29:02,816
Well, I believe in Richard Nixon.

1470
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,906
I worked in the White House
for four years and so did my wife.

1471
01:29:05,989 --> 01:29:10,164
What happened on June 17, I don't
think the President knew anything about.

1472
01:29:10,539 --> 01:29:12,919
Is it possible that some of his people
might have known?

1473
01:29:13,044 --> 01:29:14,129
I'm not sure about that.

1474
01:29:14,213 --> 01:29:16,259
Do you think the truth
will ever come out at the trial?

1475
01:29:16,342 --> 01:29:18,220
-That's another thing I'm not sure about.
-Why?

1476
01:29:18,303 --> 01:29:20,975
Well, obviously, because certain people
lied to the prosecutor.

1477
01:29:21,059 --> 01:29:23,313
No.
We were never told flat out, "Don't talk! "

1478
01:29:23,397 --> 01:29:25,233
But the message was clear, though.

1479
01:29:25,316 --> 01:29:28,364
In other words, by their very silence,
there was a cover-up.

1480
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:31,244
Well, they didn't urge us
to come forward and tell the truth.

1481
01:29:31,328 --> 01:29:33,373
"They," meaning the White House?

1482
01:29:33,456 --> 01:29:35,669
Well, the Committee's not
an independent operation.

1483
01:29:35,753 --> 01:29:37,757
Everything's cleared
with the White House.

1484
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:41,054
And I don't think the FBI or
the prosecutors understand that.

1485
01:29:41,138 --> 01:29:43,100
That report on the cash...

1486
01:29:44,017 --> 01:29:47,859
in the CREEP safe, that $350,000?

1487
01:29:47,942 --> 01:29:50,405
-No, more.
-Was that a correct figure?

1488
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:52,826
No, it was closer to $1,000,000.

1489
01:29:54,287 --> 01:29:56,958
And, as treasurer,
you could release those funds?

1490
01:29:57,042 --> 01:29:58,629
When so ordered.

1491
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,383
We don't know the names of the people
who could order you.

1492
01:30:01,467 --> 01:30:03,679
-We just know that there were four.
-No, there were five.

1493
01:30:03,762 --> 01:30:06,601
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder,
they're obvious.

1494
01:30:07,478 --> 01:30:10,818
-There had to be a White House overseer.
-Yeah, Colson.

1495
01:30:11,068 --> 01:30:14,992
No, Colson's too smart to get involved
directly with anything like that.

1496
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:17,497
It's Haldeman.

1497
01:30:19,793 --> 01:30:20,962
Right?

1498
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:24,258
I won't talk about the other two.

1499
01:30:24,343 --> 01:30:26,221
They both worked at the White House?

1500
01:30:26,304 --> 01:30:29,936
One of them did, the other one's not
in Washington. But that's all I'll say.

1501
01:30:30,019 --> 01:30:32,232
-Kalmbach.
-Nixon's personal lawyer.

1502
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:34,569
-Right?
-Nixon's personal lawyer?

1503
01:30:34,653 --> 01:30:36,990
I can't say anything. I'm sorry.

1504
01:30:38,703 --> 01:30:40,957
-Well....
-When's the baby due?

1505
01:30:43,378 --> 01:30:45,047
Soon. Next month.

1506
01:30:45,757 --> 01:30:48,553
-Are you going to stay here?
-No, I don't think so.

1507
01:30:48,637 --> 01:30:50,516
Decided where you're gonna go?

1508
01:30:50,599 --> 01:30:54,190
I've been looking for a job
in the private sector, but it's....

1509
01:30:54,607 --> 01:30:57,613
It's very hard.
My name's been in the papers too much.

1510
01:30:59,073 --> 01:31:02,621
You know, one thing I'm just
still not completely clear about?

1511
01:31:03,915 --> 01:31:07,088
When you handed out the money,
how did that work, exactly?

1512
01:31:07,172 --> 01:31:08,382
Badly.

1513
01:31:12,014 --> 01:31:16,189
I think what Bob means is, that
ordinarily, what was the procedure?

1514
01:31:16,481 --> 01:31:19,862
Routine. I'd call John Mitchell
over at the Justice Department.

1515
01:31:19,945 --> 01:31:21,573
He'd say, "Go ahead, give out the money."

1516
01:31:21,657 --> 01:31:23,744
This was all done verbally?

1517
01:31:24,704 --> 01:31:25,789
Yes.

1518
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:29,171
Okay, we know there were five men
who controlled the slush fund.

1519
01:31:29,296 --> 01:31:30,423
Mitchell, Stans, and Magruder.

1520
01:31:30,507 --> 01:31:33,470
Yeah, those three we've got. And all three
have been named by two sources.

1521
01:31:33,553 --> 01:31:35,266
What about the other two?

1522
01:31:35,724 --> 01:31:37,728
-Kalmbach.
-We're pretty sure of Kalmbach.

1523
01:31:38,062 --> 01:31:40,859
Maybe we better wait
until we get all five, huh?

1524
01:31:40,943 --> 01:31:42,112
Certain on Mitchell?

1525
01:31:42,237 --> 01:31:45,492
We know that he approved payments
to Liddy while he was Attorney General.

1526
01:31:45,576 --> 01:31:47,329
-You've got more than one source?
-Yes, Harry.

1527
01:31:47,413 --> 01:31:48,498
-Who are they?
-Sloan.

1528
01:31:48,581 --> 01:31:49,667
Sloan and who else?

1529
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,754
There's another guy at Justice
who so far won't confirm...

1530
01:31:51,837 --> 01:31:54,217
the names of the others who
control the fund. We're working on it.

1531
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,346
-What about Deep Throat?
-He's not a source on this.

1532
01:31:56,429 --> 01:31:57,765
-But do any of them have an axe?
-No.

1533
01:31:57,849 --> 01:31:59,644
Personal, political, sexual.

1534
01:31:59,728 --> 01:32:01,314
-Is there anything at all on Mitchell?
-No.

1535
01:32:01,397 --> 01:32:02,816
-Then can we use their names?
-No.

1536
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:07,032
God damn it! When is somebody
gonna go on the record in this story?

1537
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:12,918
You guys are about to write a story
that says the former Attorney General...

1538
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:16,842
the highest ranking law enforcement
officer in this country is a crook!

1539
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,186
Just be sure you're right.

1540
01:32:25,149 --> 01:32:28,071
<i>OPERATOR: Essex House, may I help you?
CARL: John Mitchell.</i>

1541
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:37,254
<i>MITCHELL: Yes?</i>

1542
01:32:38,089 --> 01:32:40,553
<i>Sir, this is Carl Bernstein
of the Washington Post...</i>

1543
01:32:40,677 --> 01:32:43,057
and I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour.

1544
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:46,940
Tomorrow we're running a story
in the paper...

1545
01:32:47,023 --> 01:32:50,571
and we just think that you should
have a chance to comment on it.

1546
01:32:52,116 --> 01:32:53,451
<i>What does it say?</i>

1547
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,582
"John M. Mitchell, while serving...

1548
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:59,797
"as United States Attorney General...

1549
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,343
"personally controlled a secret cash fund...

1550
01:33:02,427 --> 01:33:04,889
"that was used to gather information
about the Democrats...

1551
01:33:04,973 --> 01:33:06,225
<i>-"according to"--
-Jesus.</i>

1552
01:33:06,308 --> 01:33:08,395
"...sources involved
in the Watergate investigation."

1553
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:11,485
<i>-Jesus.
-"Beginning in the spring of 1971 ...</i>

1554
01:33:11,568 --> 01:33:13,738
"almost a year before he left
the Justice Department...

1555
01:33:13,823 --> 01:33:16,285
"to become President Nixon's
campaign manager...

1556
01:33:16,369 --> 01:33:20,626
"on March 1, Mitchell personally
approved withdrawals from the fund."

1557
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:23,257
<i>All that crap.
You're putting it in the paper?</i>

1558
01:33:23,341 --> 01:33:25,511
<i>-Well--
-It's all been denied.</i>

1559
01:33:26,179 --> 01:33:28,183
<i>You tell your publisher,
tell Katie Graham...</i>

1560
01:33:28,266 --> 01:33:31,522
<i>she's going to get her tit caught in
the big ringer if that's published.</i>

1561
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,277
<i>Christ, that's the most
sickening thing I ever heard.</i>

1562
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,656
Sir, I was just wondering
if I could ask you some questions?

1563
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:39,161
<i>-What time is it?
-It's 11:30, sir.</i>

1564
01:33:39,746 --> 01:33:42,709
<i>11:30? Is it morning or night?</i>

1565
01:33:42,792 --> 01:33:44,755
It's 1 1 :30 at night, sir.

1566
01:33:46,424 --> 01:33:50,765
Sir, the Committee to Re-Elect
has issued a statement to our story...

1567
01:33:50,849 --> 01:33:52,518
but there are just a couple of questions--

1568
01:33:52,602 --> 01:33:55,524
<i>Did the Committee tell you
to go ahead and publish the story?</i>

1569
01:33:55,608 --> 01:33:58,154
<i>You fellows have got
a great ballgame going.</i>

1570
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:01,744
<i>As soon as you're done,
we're going to do a story on all of you.</i>

1571
01:34:01,828 --> 01:34:03,665
Sir, there's just a couple of questions--

1572
01:34:03,748 --> 01:34:05,919
<i>Call my law office in the morning.</i>

1573
01:34:08,674 --> 01:34:11,303
There's no question
you properly identified yourself?

1574
01:34:11,387 --> 01:34:13,599
He said it right off the top.

1575
01:34:14,518 --> 01:34:16,438
Mitchell know
he was talking to a reporter?

1576
01:34:16,522 --> 01:34:18,859
Yeah, but I think I woke him up.

1577
01:34:19,318 --> 01:34:21,364
-Get good notes?
-Verbatim.

1578
01:34:23,117 --> 01:34:25,789
He really said that about Mrs. Graham?

1579
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:29,296
Well, I'd cut the words "her tit"
and print it.

1580
01:34:29,379 --> 01:34:30,465
Why?

1581
01:34:30,548 --> 01:34:32,634
This is a family newspaper.

1582
01:34:36,015 --> 01:34:37,478
You know, once when I was reporting...

1583
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:40,107
Lyndon Johnson's top guy
gave me the word.

1584
01:34:40,691 --> 01:34:43,822
They were looking for a successor
for J. Edgar Hoover.

1585
01:34:43,905 --> 01:34:47,662
I wrote it and the day it appeared,
Johnson held a press conference...

1586
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:50,752
and appointed Hoover
head of the FBI for life.

1587
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:54,008
When he was done,
he turned to his top guy...

1588
01:34:54,091 --> 01:34:57,765
and the President said,
"Call Ben Bradlee and tell him, 'Fuck you."'

1589
01:34:58,307 --> 01:35:00,686
Then everybody said,
"You did it, Ben. You screwed up.

1590
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:03,232
"You stuck us with Hoover forever."

1591
01:35:04,318 --> 01:35:06,990
I screwed up, but I wasn't wrong.

1592
01:35:10,956 --> 01:35:13,793
How much can you tell me
about Deep Throat?

1593
01:35:14,795 --> 01:35:17,008
How much do you need to know?

1594
01:35:17,092 --> 01:35:18,720
Do you trust him?

1595
01:35:20,389 --> 01:35:21,475
Yeah.

1596
01:35:23,729 --> 01:35:28,321
I can't do the reporting for my reporters
which means I have to trust them.

1597
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:32,120
And I hate trusting anybody.

1598
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:42,013
Run that, baby.

1599
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:23,673
<i>TV ANNOUNCER: The Washington Post
reported that...</i>

1600
01:36:23,757 --> 01:36:25,844
<i>while still in office as Attorney General...</i>

1601
01:36:25,928 --> 01:36:30,102
<i>John Mitchell had personally
controlled a secret Republican fund.</i>

1602
01:36:30,227 --> 01:36:34,152
<i>Mitchell denied any such involvement
and called the story ludicrous.</i>

1603
01:36:34,569 --> 01:36:37,866
<i>The new charge also brought a response
from Vice President Agnew...</i>

1604
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:39,327
<i>at his stop in Tampa.</i>

1605
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:42,208
<i>I have full confidence in Mr. Mitchell...</i>

1606
01:36:43,042 --> 01:36:46,215
<i>and in the people
in the Republican organization.</i>

1607
01:36:46,299 --> 01:36:50,222
<i>And I think that that kind
of unattributed report...</i>

1608
01:36:50,306 --> 01:36:53,103
<i>at a time like this is counterproductive.</i>

1609
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:57,027
<i>We must bear in mind
that those who published it...</i>

1610
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:01,159
<i>have already shown
their sympathy for the other ticket.</i>

1611
01:37:01,243 --> 01:37:02,871
<i>TV ANNOUNCER: A band
and some young cheerleaders....</i>

1612
01:37:02,954 --> 01:37:04,415
All non-denial denials.

1613
01:37:04,498 --> 01:37:07,254
They doubt our ancestry,
but they don't say the story isn't accurate.

1614
01:37:07,337 --> 01:37:09,383
I mean, did you understand
one thing he was saying?

1615
01:37:09,466 --> 01:37:12,680
What I can't figure out is,
what is a real denial?

1616
01:37:12,806 --> 01:37:16,980
Well, if they start calling us goddamn liars,
we better start circling the wagons.

1617
01:37:17,106 --> 01:37:18,942
When do you think they'll start doing that?

1618
01:37:19,026 --> 01:37:20,570
When they get out of Tampa.

1619
01:37:21,864 --> 01:37:24,578
CARL: Joe, come on.
What's going on with you guys at the FBI?

1620
01:37:24,661 --> 01:37:26,289
I've been trying to get to you for weeks.

1621
01:37:26,372 --> 01:37:27,708
Your secretary says you're not in.

1622
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:29,879
Last night I called,
you said you couldn't talk...

1623
01:37:29,962 --> 01:37:32,634
and this morning, as soon as
our Mitchell story hits the stands...

1624
01:37:32,717 --> 01:37:35,097
you call me and say you've got
to see me right away. Why?

1625
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:37,811
Look, you guys have been causing
big trouble at the Bureau.

1626
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:38,979
Why?

1627
01:37:39,355 --> 01:37:42,819
Our reports are showing up
in your paper almost verbatim.

1628
01:37:42,903 --> 01:37:46,618
I mean, you've really been on the mark,
except for Mitchell.

1629
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:48,831
Now, we didn't have that...

1630
01:37:49,206 --> 01:37:51,837
-that he controlled the funds.
-Right.

1631
01:37:52,004 --> 01:37:53,840
Our agents have been busting ass...

1632
01:37:53,923 --> 01:37:56,304
but we're gonna go back now
and see if we've missed anything.

1633
01:37:56,429 --> 01:37:58,182
What I don't understand is all the people...

1634
01:37:58,265 --> 01:38:00,352
who might know details
of the bugging operation...

1635
01:38:00,435 --> 01:38:02,063
the FBI hasn't even talked to.

1636
01:38:02,146 --> 01:38:04,652
And why have you conducted your
interviews of CREEP personnel...

1637
01:38:04,735 --> 01:38:05,904
at CREEP headquarters...

1638
01:38:05,988 --> 01:38:09,034
instead of at their homes
where they might feel freer to talk?

1639
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:10,329
Joe, wait a minute.

1640
01:38:10,412 --> 01:38:13,209
Why have the interviews at CREEP
always been conducted...

1641
01:38:13,293 --> 01:38:15,922
within the presence of the lawyer
who works for CREEP?

1642
01:38:16,006 --> 01:38:19,012
Look, you know I can't answer
for the whole Bureau.

1643
01:38:19,095 --> 01:38:22,016
-Oh, come on, I'm just--
-I do what I'm told.

1644
01:38:23,269 --> 01:38:25,482
I followed my orders. Period.

1645
01:38:31,702 --> 01:38:33,079
What orders?

1646
01:38:37,253 --> 01:38:39,257
CARL: Wait. Woodward!

1647
01:38:41,887 --> 01:38:42,972
Wait!

1648
01:38:44,308 --> 01:38:45,393
Bob!

1649
01:38:48,233 --> 01:38:50,653
Out of the blue. Out of the blue.

1650
01:38:52,782 --> 01:38:56,080
Okay, this morning I get a tip
to call a guy by the name of Alex Shipley...

1651
01:38:56,163 --> 01:38:58,668
who is now the Assistant
Attorney General of Tennessee.

1652
01:38:58,752 --> 01:39:01,299
Now, the guy told me, that called me,
that said....

1653
01:39:01,424 --> 01:39:04,095
He said that Shipley was asked
in the summer of 1971 ...

1654
01:39:04,178 --> 01:39:06,599
by an old army buddy, a Donald Segretti...

1655
01:39:06,683 --> 01:39:08,561
to join a group of other lawyers...

1656
01:39:08,645 --> 01:39:11,108
for Nixon's campaign to sabotage
the Democratic candidates.

1657
01:39:11,191 --> 01:39:13,195
Listen, make a left when you can.
We'll go to my place.

1658
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:14,364
Sabotage Democratic candidates?

1659
01:39:14,489 --> 01:39:16,952
That's right. Now, I was able to make
a couple of calls today...

1660
01:39:17,077 --> 01:39:18,914
and I got Segretti's records for the year....

1661
01:39:18,998 --> 01:39:21,961
His travel records for the years 1971-'72.

1662
01:39:22,504 --> 01:39:23,631
Does the FBI know about....

1663
01:39:23,714 --> 01:39:24,967
-Did you say left or right?
-Left!

1664
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:27,430
We're going to my place.
We gotta go over the records.

1665
01:39:27,513 --> 01:39:30,309
-Does the FBI know about Segretti?
-The FBI interrogated Segretti...

1666
01:39:30,393 --> 01:39:33,107
and found out he wasn't involved
in the break-in so they dropped it.

1667
01:39:33,191 --> 01:39:34,276
They didn't follow through on it.

1668
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,486
-Where is he?
-He's in California.

1669
01:39:36,739 --> 01:39:38,450
BOB: Jesus, look at this.
CARL: What?

1670
01:39:38,534 --> 01:39:42,082
BOB: Segretti crisscrossed the country
at least a dozen times.

1671
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:46,506
He only stayed in cities
where there were Democratic primaries.

1672
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:50,013
CARL: If the break-in is just one incident
in a campaign of sabotage...

1673
01:39:50,096 --> 01:39:51,725
that began a whole year
before Watergate....

1674
01:39:51,808 --> 01:39:53,728
BOB: Then for the first time,
the break-in makes sense.

1675
01:39:53,811 --> 01:39:55,022
CARL: This isn't so crazy.

1676
01:39:55,106 --> 01:39:57,443
This thing didn't start
with the bugging at the headquarters.

1677
01:39:57,526 --> 01:39:59,614
Segretti was doing this
a year before the bugging.

1678
01:39:59,697 --> 01:40:01,493
And a year before,
Nixon wasn't slaughtering Muskie.

1679
01:40:01,576 --> 01:40:05,291
He was running behind Muskie,
before Muskie self-destructed.

1680
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:07,545
If he self-destructed.

1681
01:40:08,631 --> 01:40:11,135
-Hi. Donald Segretti?
-That's right.

1682
01:40:11,428 --> 01:40:14,350
<i>I'm Carl Bernstein
from the Washington Post.</i>

1683
01:40:14,892 --> 01:40:15,978
Hi.

1684
01:40:16,813 --> 01:40:18,607
What can I do for you?

1685
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:23,199
Well, my paper just sent me out here
to try to persuade you to go on the record.

1686
01:40:23,451 --> 01:40:24,535
Why me?

1687
01:40:24,619 --> 01:40:26,747
I guess because you were
the head coordinator...

1688
01:40:26,831 --> 01:40:30,337
of Nixon's sabotage campaign
against the Democrats.

1689
01:40:31,589 --> 01:40:34,637
-Carl, you want some coffee?
-You read my mind.

1690
01:40:40,482 --> 01:40:42,444
Carl, tell me something.

1691
01:40:43,403 --> 01:40:45,950
What do you imagine
the head coordinator does?

1692
01:40:46,075 --> 01:40:49,957
Well, I guess basically you're involved
in recruiting other people like yourself...

1693
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:51,126
other lawyers.

1694
01:40:51,209 --> 01:40:53,881
-Lawyers?
-Like Alex Shipley.

1695
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:58,849
I made it clear that I would not do
anything violent or illegal.

1696
01:40:59,141 --> 01:41:01,312
What do you mean by illegal?

1697
01:41:01,813 --> 01:41:05,486
Watergate, I mean, that's....
The whole bugging. That's horrendous!

1698
01:41:05,862 --> 01:41:08,200
And what kind of stuff
do you guys do then?

1699
01:41:08,283 --> 01:41:10,161
Nickel-and-dime stuff.

1700
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:14,711
Stuff. Stuff with a little wit attached to it.

1701
01:41:14,795 --> 01:41:17,007
You mean, when you sent out
on Muskie's stationery that...

1702
01:41:17,091 --> 01:41:20,388
Senator Hubert Humphrey
was going out with call girls?

1703
01:41:20,806 --> 01:41:23,561
Listen, if anything,
it helped the man's image.

1704
01:41:23,645 --> 01:41:26,817
What was the one
on Muskie's stationery that you sent out...

1705
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:30,406
that said that Scoop Jackson
was having a bastard child?

1706
01:41:30,824 --> 01:41:34,206
So, sometimes it got up to a quarter.
Off the record.

1707
01:41:34,748 --> 01:41:38,672
I think one of the most interesting ones
was the Canuck letter.

1708
01:41:39,632 --> 01:41:41,136
What about it?

1709
01:41:41,845 --> 01:41:45,393
Come on. Where you claimed
that Muskie slurred the Canadians.

1710
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:47,522
No, I didn't write that.

1711
01:41:47,856 --> 01:41:49,066
Do you know who did?

1712
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:52,448
Carl, when you guys print it in the papers,
then I'll know.

1713
01:41:52,531 --> 01:41:54,201
Smart guy, Donald.

1714
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:56,539
You're no dummy.

1715
01:41:57,415 --> 01:41:59,169
I'm a lawyer, Carl.

1716
01:41:59,753 --> 01:42:02,257
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer...

1717
01:42:02,842 --> 01:42:06,683
and I'll probably wind up
going to jail and being disbarred...

1718
01:42:07,351 --> 01:42:11,649
and I don't know what I did
that was so goddamn awful.

1719
01:42:17,368 --> 01:42:20,416
I'll tell you something.
None of this was my idea.

1720
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,379
I didn't go looking for the job.

1721
01:42:22,462 --> 01:42:24,382
Well, that's important.

1722
01:42:25,551 --> 01:42:27,304
Chapin came to you.

1723
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:35,235
You know what?

1724
01:42:35,319 --> 01:42:39,326
It's funny, but I keep forgetting that
you guys knew each other in college.

1725
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:43,083
You were friends at SC, you and Chapin.
Who else was there?

1726
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,045
There was me...

1727
01:42:45,838 --> 01:42:47,006
Dwight...

1728
01:42:47,508 --> 01:42:48,760
Ziegler...

1729
01:42:48,969 --> 01:42:50,513
all the USC mafia.

1730
01:42:50,681 --> 01:42:53,644
And that's when you got involved
in meaningless student elections...

1731
01:42:53,728 --> 01:42:57,819
when you start to try to get your man in
so you stuffed ballot boxes and....

1732
01:42:57,903 --> 01:43:01,409
What's that term you guys use
for screwing up the opposition?

1733
01:43:01,534 --> 01:43:04,039
-Rat-fucking.
-That's right.

1734
01:43:04,122 --> 01:43:05,917
You were just doing
the same kind of stuff...

1735
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:08,756
when you were out campaigning
for President Nixon.

1736
01:43:08,839 --> 01:43:12,637
Let me tell you something,
we did a lot of worse things in college.

1737
01:43:13,723 --> 01:43:16,019
Look, let me ask you something, Carl.

1738
01:43:16,394 --> 01:43:19,066
What would you have done
if you were just getting out of the army...

1739
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:21,279
been away from the real world
for four years...

1740
01:43:21,363 --> 01:43:24,659
didn't know what kind of law
you wanted to practice...

1741
01:43:24,744 --> 01:43:27,290
and one day you get a call
from an old friend...

1742
01:43:27,415 --> 01:43:31,339
asking if you want to go to work
for the President of the United States?

1743
01:43:32,133 --> 01:43:35,680
Chapin was the appointment
secretary for Nixon when he called.

1744
01:43:35,764 --> 01:43:38,853
Yeah. Listen,
if those sinister things really happened...

1745
01:43:38,937 --> 01:43:40,773
I don't think Dwight
knew anything about them.

1746
01:43:40,856 --> 01:43:42,401
He just did what he was told.

1747
01:43:42,485 --> 01:43:43,904
Told by who?

1748
01:43:55,132 --> 01:43:57,345
What's the topic for tonight?

1749
01:44:02,522 --> 01:44:03,941
Rat-fucking.

1750
01:44:06,029 --> 01:44:09,242
In my day it was simply known
as the double-cross.

1751
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:12,165
In our present context...

1752
01:44:13,918 --> 01:44:16,673
it means infiltration of the Democrats.

1753
01:44:18,593 --> 01:44:21,014
Segretti won't go on the record...

1754
01:44:21,223 --> 01:44:24,520
but if he would,
we know he would implicate Chapin.

1755
01:44:26,024 --> 01:44:29,029
And that would put you
inside the White House.

1756
01:44:29,864 --> 01:44:30,949
Who?

1757
01:44:33,329 --> 01:44:34,706
Be specific.

1758
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:37,252
How high up?

1759
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:43,388
You'll have to find that out for yourself.

1760
01:44:44,892 --> 01:44:46,853
I don't like newspapers.

1761
01:44:48,899 --> 01:44:51,737
I don't care for inexactitude...

1762
01:44:52,656 --> 01:44:54,285
and shallowness.

1763
01:44:55,662 --> 01:44:58,875
The CREEP slush fund
that financed the rat-fucking...

1764
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,255
we've just about got that nailed down.
I don't know how--

1765
01:45:01,339 --> 01:45:03,092
Did you change cabs?

1766
01:45:10,314 --> 01:45:11,399
Yeah.

1767
01:45:12,109 --> 01:45:14,447
Does the FBI know what we know?

1768
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:20,124
Does Justice?

1769
01:45:24,339 --> 01:45:26,636
Why haven't they done anything?

1770
01:45:27,304 --> 01:45:31,770
If it didn't deal directly with the break-in,
they didn't pursue.

1771
01:45:32,897 --> 01:45:34,692
Who told them not to?

1772
01:45:35,026 --> 01:45:37,740
Don't you understand what you're on to?

1773
01:45:41,288 --> 01:45:44,335
-Mitchell knew?
-Of course Mitchell knew.

1774
01:45:45,253 --> 01:45:48,008
Do you think something this size
just happens?

1775
01:45:48,091 --> 01:45:49,929
Haldeman had to know, too.

1776
01:45:50,012 --> 01:45:52,808
You'll get nothing from me
about Haldeman.

1777
01:45:56,859 --> 01:45:58,319
Segretti said that--

1778
01:45:58,403 --> 01:46:01,867
Don't concentrate on Segretti.
You'll miss the overall.

1779
01:46:04,163 --> 01:46:07,628
The letter that destroyed
the Muskie candidacy...

1780
01:46:07,711 --> 01:46:09,882
the Canuck letter,
did that come from inside the White--

1781
01:46:09,965 --> 01:46:11,760
You're missing the overall.

1782
01:46:11,928 --> 01:46:13,264
But what overall?

1783
01:46:13,347 --> 01:46:16,645
They were frightened of Muskie,
and look who got destroyed.

1784
01:46:16,729 --> 01:46:20,568
They wanted to run against McGovern.
Look who they're running against.

1785
01:46:20,735 --> 01:46:23,741
They bugged, they followed people...

1786
01:46:24,242 --> 01:46:26,580
false press leaks, fake letters.

1787
01:46:27,248 --> 01:46:29,711
They canceled
Democratic campaign rallies.

1788
01:46:29,794 --> 01:46:32,924
They investigated
Democratic private lives.

1789
01:46:33,593 --> 01:46:36,598
They planted spies, stole documents,
and on and on.

1790
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:41,106
Now, don't tell me you think this is
all the work of little Don Segretti.

1791
01:46:43,443 --> 01:46:45,656
The FBI and Justice know this?

1792
01:46:49,204 --> 01:46:51,042
[Car engine starting]

1793
01:49:16,769 --> 01:49:17,980
-Carl?
-Yeah.

1794
01:49:18,064 --> 01:49:20,067
Why don't you pick up
your messages more often?

1795
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:21,987
-Right. You got a cigarette?
-Yeah.

1796
01:49:22,196 --> 01:49:23,407
Who's Pete Teller?

1797
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:26,829
I haven't the slightest idea, Carl.
I have this whole place to take care of.

1798
01:49:26,913 --> 01:49:28,583
-Carl?
-Yeah, one second.

1799
01:49:30,294 --> 01:49:33,217
Tell him to leave his phone number
next time, all right? Hi, Sally.

1800
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,220
Listen, do you guys know
about the Canuck letter?

1801
01:49:35,303 --> 01:49:36,472
Yep. I'm sorry, I'm late.

1802
01:49:36,556 --> 01:49:39,353
I just wanted to make sure
you knew who wrote it.

1803
01:49:40,438 --> 01:49:42,859
What? What!

1804
01:49:43,068 --> 01:49:45,281
You mean the letter that sabotaged
the Muskie candidacy?

1805
01:49:45,364 --> 01:49:47,033
All right, come here.

1806
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,245
When did he tell you this?

1807
01:49:49,371 --> 01:49:51,291
[Mumbling]

1808
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:54,381
Gotta tell Bob.

1809
01:49:57,636 --> 01:49:59,306
-Woodward.
-What?

1810
01:50:00,182 --> 01:50:02,562
One second. Very important.... Come here.

1811
01:50:04,024 --> 01:50:06,068
Tell him what you told me.

1812
01:50:07,154 --> 01:50:08,699
Here, sit down.

1813
01:50:10,576 --> 01:50:14,000
Just exactly the way you said it to me,
say it to him.

1814
01:50:14,585 --> 01:50:16,922
Ken Clawson told me
he wrote the Canuck letter.

1815
01:50:17,006 --> 01:50:18,925
The letter that said Muskie
was slurring the Canadians.

1816
01:50:19,009 --> 01:50:20,094
Clawson?

1817
01:50:20,178 --> 01:50:23,184
The Deputy Director of White House
Communications wrote the Canuck letter.

1818
01:50:23,267 --> 01:50:25,396
-When did he tell you this?
-When we were having drinks.

1819
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,359
-Where were you?
-My apartment.

1820
01:50:27,442 --> 01:50:29,529
-When did you say he told you?
-Two weeks ago.

1821
01:50:29,612 --> 01:50:32,159
What else did he say?
He didn't say anything?

1822
01:50:32,284 --> 01:50:33,369
Come on, you're hedging.

1823
01:50:33,453 --> 01:50:36,124
You think he said it to impress you
to get you to go to bed with him?

1824
01:50:36,207 --> 01:50:38,128
-Jesus.
-No, I want to hear her say it.

1825
01:50:38,211 --> 01:50:41,551
Do you think he said that to impress you,
try to get you to go to bed with him?

1826
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:45,058
Why did it take you two weeks
to tell us this, Sally?

1827
01:50:46,352 --> 01:50:50,151
I guess I don't have the taste
for the jugular you guys have.

1828
01:50:53,323 --> 01:50:55,117
You're claiming
it was all a misunderstanding?

1829
01:50:55,201 --> 01:50:57,455
<i>CLAWSON: Absolutely.
Sally's got it all wrong.</i>

1830
01:50:57,538 --> 01:50:59,584
<i>I never told her that I wrote that letter.</i>

1831
01:50:59,668 --> 01:51:01,755
<i>We were just shooting the breeze
about the election.</i>

1832
01:51:01,839 --> 01:51:03,091
She's an awfully good reporter.

1833
01:51:03,175 --> 01:51:05,428
I don't remember her getting
that much wrong before, do you?

1834
01:51:05,512 --> 01:51:07,892
<i>Look,
that's a real bullshit question, Woodward.</i>

1835
01:51:07,975 --> 01:51:10,771
<i>That is a question
straight out of Wichita, Kansas.</i>

1836
01:51:10,855 --> 01:51:12,316
Listen. One last thing.

1837
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:15,405
Do you remember where
this shooting the breeze took place?

1838
01:51:15,488 --> 01:51:17,450
<i>What do you mean, where?</i>

1839
01:51:17,701 --> 01:51:20,164
I mean, was it a restaurant,
or her apartment, or a bar?

1840
01:51:20,247 --> 01:51:22,293
<i>Now, look.
I'd forgotten the entire incident...</i>

1841
01:51:22,376 --> 01:51:24,505
<i>but it most certainly
wasn't in her apartment.</i>

1842
01:51:24,589 --> 01:51:28,179
<i>-Do you remember when it took place?
-I don't have time for this. I'm a busy man.</i>

1843
01:51:28,262 --> 01:51:29,347
Did you get all that?

1844
01:51:29,431 --> 01:51:31,435
What did he say about
meeting in a bar or restaurant?

1845
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:32,937
He said he forgot the entire incident.

1846
01:51:33,021 --> 01:51:35,484
-That means he didn't deny it.
-That's a non-denial denial.

1847
01:51:35,567 --> 01:51:37,029
Wichita, Kansas?

1848
01:51:37,112 --> 01:51:39,200
Yeah, he said
that's a bullshit question, Woodward--

1849
01:51:39,283 --> 01:51:41,495
I know what he said.
But I'm from Wheaton, lllinois.

1850
01:51:41,579 --> 01:51:43,165
Hey, Bob, Carl. He's on the phone.

1851
01:51:43,248 --> 01:51:44,751
-Who?
-[Whispering] Clawson.

1852
01:51:48,634 --> 01:51:52,432
Get over there on line 4
and transcribe this, will you? Four.

1853
01:51:53,183 --> 01:51:54,853
-Four?
-Okay. Yeah.

1854
01:51:56,397 --> 01:51:57,524
Yes, Ken.

1855
01:51:57,608 --> 01:52:00,989
<i>Sally, for Christ's sakes,
don't tell them I came to your place.</i>

1856
01:52:01,073 --> 01:52:03,536
Why not? What's wrong
with coming over for a drink?

1857
01:52:03,619 --> 01:52:06,124
<i>You and me? In your apartment?</i>

1858
01:52:06,959 --> 01:52:08,044
Well?

1859
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,300
<i>Jesus Christ, you just shot me down.</i>

1860
01:52:11,384 --> 01:52:15,140
<i>If that appears in the papers
that I'm over at your house, having....</i>

1861
01:52:15,892 --> 01:52:18,730
<i>-Do you know what that does?
-No, I don't see why.</i>

1862
01:52:18,814 --> 01:52:20,860
<i>You don't? You don't?</i>

1863
01:52:21,987 --> 01:52:25,285
<i>-There's nothing bad about it.
-Well, there sure is.</i>

1864
01:52:27,497 --> 01:52:29,458
<i>This is just incredible.</i>

1865
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:31,921
Well, I have a clear conscience.

1866
01:52:32,005 --> 01:52:35,136
<i>Sally, I have a wife, and a family,
and a dog, and a cat.</i>

1867
01:52:36,597 --> 01:52:38,517
She said that he was in her house
having drinks.

1868
01:52:38,601 --> 01:52:41,774
Now, look, I don't care where it happened.
What happened is what counts.

1869
01:52:41,857 --> 01:52:45,028
When we asked him about it,
he said he forgot the entire incident.

1870
01:52:45,363 --> 01:52:47,659
<i>BRADLEE: Yeah?
OPERATOR: Ken Clawson on the line.</i>

1871
01:52:47,826 --> 01:52:50,164
-Ken Clawson on the line.
-Jesus.

1872
01:52:53,169 --> 01:52:54,964
Ken. What's up, kid?

1873
01:52:55,048 --> 01:52:57,886
<i>Ben, now, look, this whole thing
that's going on over there, Ben...</i>

1874
01:52:57,969 --> 01:53:00,975
<i>I want you to know that I never
claimed authorship of the Canuck letter!</i>

1875
01:53:01,059 --> 01:53:02,519
Says he never wrote the letter.

1876
01:53:02,603 --> 01:53:05,525
<i>It's some kind of misunderstanding,
a confusion, I want you to know--</i>

1877
01:53:05,609 --> 01:53:08,615
Slow down, Ken. You sound frazzled.

1878
01:53:08,698 --> 01:53:10,159
<i>Now, Ben, please, listen.</i>

1879
01:53:10,243 --> 01:53:13,791
<i>If you're going to refer to that
alleged conversation with Sally Aiken...</i>

1880
01:53:13,874 --> 01:53:16,254
<i>you can't print that it took place
in her apartment.</i>

1881
01:53:16,379 --> 01:53:19,133
<i>I have a wife, and a family,
and a dog, and a cat.</i>

1882
01:53:19,218 --> 01:53:21,512
"A wife, and a family,
and a dog, and a cat."

1883
01:53:21,597 --> 01:53:23,683
Right, Ken, right. Yeah.

1884
01:53:23,767 --> 01:53:27,149
Now, Ken, I don't want to print
that you were in Sally's apartment.

1885
01:53:27,232 --> 01:53:28,317
<i>Thank God.</i>

1886
01:53:28,401 --> 01:53:31,866
I just want to know what you said
in Sally's apartment.

1887
01:53:33,076 --> 01:53:34,788
[Telephone ringing]

1888
01:53:44,806 --> 01:53:46,268
<i>CARL: Hello.
BOB: Bernstein...</i>

1889
01:53:46,351 --> 01:53:49,816
<i>I just got a tip from our FBI source.
The secret cash fund financed Segretti.</i>

1890
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:51,611
<i>-Jesus.
-All right. Now, listen.</i>

1891
01:53:51,694 --> 01:53:55,159
<i>Chapin hired Segretti, we know that.
And we know Haldeman hired Chapin.</i>

1892
01:53:55,242 --> 01:53:57,872
<i>Haldeman has to be the fifth name
to control the fund.</i>

1893
01:53:58,791 --> 01:54:00,251
Sloan knows.

1894
01:54:02,589 --> 01:54:04,885
We've only got four out of the five
who controlled the fund.

1895
01:54:04,968 --> 01:54:06,305
It has to be Haldeman.

1896
01:54:06,388 --> 01:54:08,474
I don't think we've got it.

1897
01:54:08,976 --> 01:54:10,938
We know the fifth
is a top White House official.

1898
01:54:11,022 --> 01:54:13,025
But no one has said it.
No one has named Haldeman.

1899
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:16,950
-No one's denied it.
-That still doesn't prove it was Haldeman.

1900
01:54:18,828 --> 01:54:21,123
If you go to bed at night
and there's no snow on the ground...

1901
01:54:21,207 --> 01:54:22,919
when you wake up
and there's snow on the ground...

1902
01:54:23,002 --> 01:54:25,632
you can say it snowed during the night,
although you didn't see it.

1903
01:54:25,715 --> 01:54:28,136
But if we can't prove the fifth man
is Haldeman, we're wiped out.

1904
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:30,266
Everything in that campaign
is done with his approval.

1905
01:54:30,349 --> 01:54:32,311
We know that everybody
who works under Haldeman...

1906
01:54:32,395 --> 01:54:34,314
does so with his knowledge.

1907
01:54:34,398 --> 01:54:36,444
And everybody is under Haldeman,
except the President.

1908
01:54:36,527 --> 01:54:38,865
Common sense says it's Haldeman.

1909
01:54:41,202 --> 01:54:43,164
If we go and see Sloan...

1910
01:54:43,248 --> 01:54:47,673
and we tell him that we know that
he named Haldeman to the Grand Jury....

1911
01:54:49,134 --> 01:54:51,888
Then all we would need to do
is have him confirm it.

1912
01:54:51,972 --> 01:54:53,141
Right.

1913
01:54:53,684 --> 01:54:55,897
-Want to do it that way?
-Yes.

1914
01:54:56,982 --> 01:54:59,110
Let's go back and see Sloan.

1915
01:55:02,575 --> 01:55:04,662
We can't go now 'cause he's not home yet.

1916
01:55:05,414 --> 01:55:08,294
He may not be answering,
but he might be there.

-Hi.
-Please.

1919
01:55:24,324 --> 01:55:27,120
Listen, we've already written the story.
We just need you to define--

1920
01:55:27,204 --> 01:55:29,166
Deborah's in the hospital
and my in-laws are coming--

1921
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:30,960
-Two questions?
-We understand.

1922
01:55:31,045 --> 01:55:32,547
Two questions?

1923
01:55:35,887 --> 01:55:38,350
The cash that financed
the Watergate break-in...

1924
01:55:38,475 --> 01:55:40,186
five men had control of the fund.

1925
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:43,275
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach.
We have confirmations on those four.

1926
01:55:43,359 --> 01:55:46,155
-We just found out Haldeman's the fifth.
-I'm not your source on that.

1927
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:49,078
We're not asking you to be our source.
All we're asking is to confirm it.

1928
01:55:49,161 --> 01:55:50,330
I'm not your source on Haldeman.

1929
01:55:50,413 --> 01:55:52,459
Okay, look, when you were questioned
by the Grand Jury--

1930
01:55:52,543 --> 01:55:53,628
You had to name names.

1931
01:55:53,712 --> 01:55:57,302
-Of course, everything they asked, yes.
-If they asked you. All right if they....

1932
01:56:00,098 --> 01:56:02,728
I don't know.... Say we wrote a story
that said that Haldeman...

1933
01:56:02,812 --> 01:56:04,606
was the fifth name to control the fund.

1934
01:56:04,690 --> 01:56:07,821
-Would we be in any trouble?
-Would we be wrong?

1935
01:56:11,327 --> 01:56:13,247
Let me put it this way.

1936
01:56:13,582 --> 01:56:16,796
I would have no problems
if you wrote a story like that.

1937
01:56:16,879 --> 01:56:18,549
-You wouldn't?
-No.

1938
01:56:20,386 --> 01:56:22,389
-That's okay. Yeah.
-Okay.

1939
01:56:22,891 --> 01:56:25,186
-Oh, you had a baby.
-Yes, my wife did.

1940
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:26,647
-Little boy or girl?
-That's terrific.

1941
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:27,816
It's a girl.

1942
01:56:27,899 --> 01:56:29,652
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1943
01:56:29,736 --> 01:56:31,531
-We're sorry to bother you.
-Yeah.

1944
01:56:31,615 --> 01:56:34,328
-Will you give our best to her?
-I will.

1945
01:56:37,417 --> 01:56:40,799
Well, I think that, Woodward,
and I am curious of the fact...

1946
01:56:40,882 --> 01:56:43,887
that the FBI, in its entire inquiry,
never talked to the....

1947
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:47,226
Or did any inquiries into the second
most-powerful man to the President.

1948
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:48,939
<i>JOE: You don't seem to understand.</i>

1949
01:56:49,022 --> 01:56:51,568
<i>No, you get nothing about Haldeman
out of me.</i>

1950
01:56:51,902 --> 01:56:53,739
But we don't need to know anything, Joe.

1951
01:56:53,823 --> 01:56:55,993
Tomorrow we're going
with a story on the FBI.

1952
01:56:56,077 --> 01:56:57,162
<i>Now, what does that mean?</i>

1953
01:56:57,246 --> 01:56:59,207
And we're going to establish
in that story...

1954
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:01,671
that you guys just about blew
the whole investigation.

1955
01:57:01,796 --> 01:57:03,591
<i>Oh, no, we didn't miss so much.</i>

1956
01:57:03,674 --> 01:57:05,678
You didn't know Haldeman
had control of the slush fund?

1957
01:57:05,762 --> 01:57:07,514
<i>Oh, yes, we did. It's all in our files.</i>

1958
01:57:07,598 --> 01:57:09,936
<i>-Not about Haldeman.
-Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman.</i>

1959
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:13,609
<i>Look, now, look, I'm very busy.
I've got to go put the kids to bed.</i>

1960
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:17,992
That's the confirmation right there.

1961
01:57:19,161 --> 01:57:21,623
Wait a minute, wait a sec.
Did he say John?

1962
01:57:22,167 --> 01:57:24,296
-He said Haldeman.
-He said John Haldeman.

1963
01:57:24,379 --> 01:57:26,884
What the hell difference does it make
if he said Isaiah or David?

1964
01:57:26,967 --> 01:57:28,052
There's only one Haldeman.

1965
01:57:28,178 --> 01:57:31,642
Yeah, well, Isaiah or David
aren't assistants to the President.

1966
01:57:32,143 --> 01:57:34,022
I don't know, it still feels thin.

1967
01:57:34,105 --> 01:57:36,151
Christ, I just wish we knew
if we could print this.

1968
01:57:36,234 --> 01:57:38,363
Now wait a minute,
we didn't make them do these things...

1969
01:57:38,447 --> 01:57:39,908
but once they did, they're fair game!

1970
01:57:39,991 --> 01:57:42,287
Harry, let's go over your sources again.
I want to hear it.

1971
01:57:42,371 --> 01:57:45,502
Sloan told the Grand Jury.
He answered everything they asked him.

1972
01:57:45,585 --> 01:57:47,505
That means
there's gotta be a record somewhere.

1973
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:50,719
He told the Grand Jury, the FBI confirms.
What more do you need?

1974
01:57:50,802 --> 01:57:51,971
I happen to love this country.

1975
01:57:52,055 --> 01:57:54,226
You know, we're not a bunch of zanies
out to bring it down!

1976
01:57:54,309 --> 01:57:56,021
Harry, weren't you arguing
the opposite way?

1977
01:57:56,104 --> 01:57:57,649
No, not at all.

1978
01:57:57,816 --> 01:57:58,901
All right, now hold it.

1979
01:57:58,985 --> 01:58:01,156
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

1980
01:58:01,364 --> 01:58:03,785
We're about to accuse Haldeman
who only happens to be...

1981
01:58:03,868 --> 01:58:05,789
the second-most-important man
in this country...

1982
01:58:05,872 --> 01:58:08,669
of conducting a criminal conspiracy
from inside the White House.

1983
01:58:08,753 --> 01:58:10,506
It would be nice if we were right.

1984
01:58:10,589 --> 01:58:12,552
-Have you double-checked your sources?
-Jesus.

1985
01:58:12,635 --> 01:58:15,431
-Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
-Absolutely!

1986
01:58:15,515 --> 01:58:17,269
-Woodward?
-I'm sure.

1987
01:58:17,853 --> 01:58:20,232
I'm not. It still seems thin.

1988
01:58:20,525 --> 01:58:21,861
Get another source.

1989
01:58:21,944 --> 01:58:25,074
How many fucking sources
do they think we've got?

1990
01:58:28,497 --> 01:58:31,920
-Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm?
-He won't confirm, I told you that.

1991
01:58:32,003 --> 01:58:33,256
What about the guy in Justice?

1992
01:58:33,339 --> 01:58:35,343
You can't call him.
He's right next to the Grand Jury.

1993
01:58:35,427 --> 01:58:37,848
-We have no choice. It's trouble.
-It's 20 minutes to deadline.

1994
01:58:37,931 --> 01:58:40,771
I don't even know
if I can get him on the phone.

1995
01:58:55,797 --> 01:58:58,261
<i>OPERATOR: Dr. Kissinger's office.
BOB: Deputy General's office, please.</i>

1996
01:59:03,104 --> 01:59:04,898
Do you know when you expect him back?

1997
01:59:04,981 --> 01:59:06,985
<i>No, sir. I believe he's left for the evening.</i>

1998
01:59:07,069 --> 01:59:10,575
<i>If you'd like to leave a message....
Oh, could you hold, please?</i>

1999
01:59:10,659 --> 01:59:13,038
Hi, this is Carl.
I'm sorry to disturb you now...

2000
01:59:13,121 --> 01:59:15,584
but we're going with the story
that Haldeman was the fifth man...

2001
01:59:15,709 --> 01:59:17,672
in control of the fund
and they're hassling us here.

2002
01:59:17,755 --> 01:59:20,427
We've got three confirmations.
If you could help us, I'd appreciate it.

2003
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:22,264
<i>LAWYER: I won't say anything
about Haldeman. Not ever.</i>

2004
01:59:22,347 --> 01:59:23,933
I understand.
We wouldn't want you to do that.

2005
01:59:24,017 --> 01:59:26,020
We know it's against the law
for you to say anything.

2006
01:59:26,104 --> 01:59:29,152
If there's a way you could warn us
to hold on the story, we'd appreciate it.

2007
01:59:29,235 --> 01:59:31,197
<i>I'd really like to help you, but I can't.</i>

2008
01:59:31,281 --> 01:59:33,743
Look, I'm going to count to 10, all right?

2009
01:59:33,827 --> 01:59:35,872
If there's any reason
we should hold on the story...

2010
01:59:35,956 --> 01:59:37,542
hang up the phone before I get to 10.

2011
01:59:37,625 --> 01:59:41,299
If the story's all right, you just be on
the phone after I get to 10, all right?

2012
01:59:41,382 --> 01:59:43,261
<i>-Hang up, right?
-That's right.</i>

2013
01:59:43,344 --> 01:59:44,680
<i>-You got it?
-Yeah.</i>

2014
01:59:44,763 --> 01:59:47,560
We're straight. All right,
I'm going to start counting, okay?

2015
01:59:47,644 --> 01:59:48,897
<i>-We all right?
-Yeah.</i>

2016
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:50,149
Okay, I'm counting.

2017
01:59:50,274 --> 01:59:52,445
One, two...

2018
01:59:52,987 --> 01:59:56,160
three, four, five...

2019
01:59:56,827 --> 01:59:58,914
six, seven...

2020
02:00:00,208 --> 02:00:04,090
eight, nine, ten.

2021
02:00:05,969 --> 02:00:08,766
<i>You got it straight now? Everything okay?</i>

2022
02:00:09,434 --> 02:00:11,145
Everything's fine.

2023
02:00:14,736 --> 02:00:15,988
Woodward!

2024
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,416
We got it.

2025
02:00:24,796 --> 02:00:26,048
-He confirmed.
-What happened?

2026
02:00:26,132 --> 02:00:28,761
I said if I get up to 10
and you don't hang up, it's solid.

2027
02:00:28,845 --> 02:00:30,056
-Did he confirm it?
-Absolutely.

2028
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:32,184
We've got to tell Bradlee!

2029
02:00:40,826 --> 02:00:44,499
Bernstein got another source.
The guy at Justice confirmed.

2030
02:00:44,666 --> 02:00:46,419
If there's any doubt,
we can run it tomorrow.

2031
02:00:46,503 --> 02:00:48,590
You don't have to. The story's solid.
We're sure of it.

2032
02:00:48,673 --> 02:00:51,679
I just got off the phone with him. It's gold.

2033
02:00:52,848 --> 02:00:54,684
Okay, we go with it.

2034
02:01:07,876 --> 02:01:09,211
Woodstein!

2035
02:01:24,698 --> 02:01:26,911
-You know what it's about?
-No.

2036
02:01:27,746 --> 02:01:29,749
<i>TV ANNOUNCER: Sloan, who resigned
as campaign treasurer...</i>

2037

<i>disclosure of campaign contributions,

2040
02:01:38,307 --> 02:01:41,187
<i>Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment
on testimony before the Grand Jury?</i>

2041
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:43,024
<i>I'd like my attorney
to answer that question.</i>

2042
02:01:43,107 --> 02:01:45,277
<i>Gentlemen, the answer is
an unequivocal "no."</i>

2043
02:01:45,362 --> 02:01:48,700
<i>Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman
in that testimony at all.</i>

2044
02:01:48,784 --> 02:01:50,788
<i>It is in his testimony
that Mr. Sloan acknowledged...</i>

2045
02:01:50,871 --> 02:01:52,792
<i>-that it was an espionage fund?
-No, not at all.</i>

2046
02:01:52,875 --> 02:01:54,963
<i>Did he mention any use of funds
for espionage activity?</i>

2047
02:01:55,046 --> 02:01:57,049
<i>None, whatsoever. Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.</i>

2054

2055
02:02:19,842 --> 02:02:22,847

02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:25,478

2057
02:02:25,603 --> 02:02:28,399

2058

-Then what went wrong?
-Nothing.

2083

Just tell us what went wrong?

2084
02:03:40,365 --> 02:03:43,330
Didn't you say that the FBI had
the information on Haldeman in the files?

2085
02:03:43,413 --> 02:03:44,874
-No.
-Because we have it in the notes...

2086
02:03:44,957 --> 02:03:47,003
from the conversation
we had on the telephone right here.

2087
02:03:47,087 --> 02:03:49,174
We have to go talk to your boss
if you don't talk to us.

2088

What the hell are you talking about?
I'll deny everything.

2089

We're not trying
to get anybody into trouble.

2090
02:03:53,932 --> 02:03:55,978
We're just trying to find out
if we made some errors.

2091
02:03:56,062 --> 02:03:58,065
If we made a mistake,
then we'll come off the story.

2092
02:03:58,148 --> 02:04:02,031
Just tell us if we're wrong.
Tell us if we screwed up.

2093
02:04:02,198 --> 02:04:03,867
I'm not talking about it.

2094
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:07,165
I am not talking to you
about Haldeman or anybody else.

2095
02:04:07,249 --> 02:04:09,920
In fact, I can't even be seen talking
to either one of you bastards.

2096
02:04:10,003 --> 02:04:13,385
-What are you afraid of? Who got to you?
-Are we being set up?

2097
02:04:14,303 --> 02:04:16,224
-Are we, Joe? Tell us!
-Are we being set up?

2098
02:04:16,308 --> 02:04:18,812
-Just tell us, we won't print it.
-Fuck you.

2099
02:04:19,062 --> 02:04:20,523
And fuck you!

2100
02:04:27,327 --> 02:04:28,496
Honest to God, I just don't know.

2101
02:04:28,621 --> 02:04:30,625
-Oh, I see.
-It's in the notes!

2102
02:04:31,419 --> 02:04:35,259
Yeah, we had another call on a long list
and I've got another call, I've gotta go.

2103
02:04:35,342 --> 02:04:37,763
-Did you mean Bob Haldeman?
-Yeah, Bob Haldeman.

2104
02:04:40,435 --> 02:04:42,606
Jesus, what was our mistake?

2105
02:04:42,940 --> 02:04:45,068
Maybe there was no mistake.

2106
02:04:45,277 --> 02:04:49,410
Then they're just setting us up.
Then the whole thing was a set-up?

2107
02:04:50,871 --> 02:04:52,750
And they just hung us.

2108
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:56,340
More denunciations.
You'll have to make a statement, Ben.

I knew we had enemies,
but I didn't know we were this popular.

Okay. Foreign?

2115
02:05:25,393 --> 02:05:27,355
All right, here's our headline.

2116
02:05:27,438 --> 02:05:30,986
Radio Hanoi reports the
United States-North Vietnam agreement...

2117
02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:33,241
for a settlement of the Vietnam War.

DEEP THROAT: Over here.

2123
02:07:36,969 --> 02:07:38,890
You let Haldeman slip away.

2124
02:07:38,973 --> 02:07:40,059
Yes.

2125
02:07:40,142 --> 02:07:42,355
You've done worse
than let Haldeman slip away.

2126
02:07:42,439 --> 02:07:46,278
You've got people feeling sorry for him.
I didn't think that was possible.

2127
02:07:46,362 --> 02:07:48,241
In a conspiracy like this...

2128
02:07:48,324 --> 02:07:51,789
you build from the outer edges
and you go step by step.

2129
02:07:51,956 --> 02:07:55,712
If you shoot too high and miss,
everybody feels more secure.

2130
02:07:55,963 --> 02:07:59,636
-You put the investigation back months.
-Yes, we know that.

2131

And if we're wrong, we're resigning.

2132
02:08:03,978 --> 02:08:05,480
Were we wrong?

2133
02:08:07,609 --> 02:08:09,739
You'll have to find that out, won't you?

2134
02:08:09,822 --> 02:08:12,745
Listen, I'm tired
of your chicken-shit games!

2135
02:08:14,038 --> 02:08:15,791
I don't want hints.

2136
02:08:16,335 --> 02:08:18,505
I need to know what you know.

2137
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:36,538
It was a Haldeman operation.

2138
02:08:38,041 --> 02:08:41,881
The whole business was run by Haldeman,
the money, everything.

2139
02:08:42,299 --> 02:08:46,557
It won't be easy getting at him. He was
insulated. You'll have to find out how.

2140
02:08:50,398 --> 02:08:53,569
Mitchell started doing covert stuff
before anyone else.

2141
02:08:53,653 --> 02:08:56,575
The list is longer than anyone can imagine.

2142
02:08:58,913 --> 02:09:02,753
It involves the entire
U.S. intelligence community...

2145

The cover-up
had little to do with Watergate.

2146
02:09:15,194 --> 02:09:18,574
It was mainly to protect
the covert operations.

2152

Why the hell didn't you tell me
over the phone?

2153
02:11:02,183 --> 02:11:04,311
-Woodward says phones aren't safe.
-Can't trust them.

2154
02:11:04,394 --> 02:11:06,190
-Come on in.
-We can't come in, sir.

2155
02:11:06,273 --> 02:11:09,321
Woodward says
there's electronic surveillance.

2156
02:11:26,018 --> 02:11:28,189
-Surveillance? Who's doing it?
-It's being done.

2157
02:11:28,273 --> 02:11:30,610
People's lives are in danger.
Maybe even ours.

2158
02:11:30,694 --> 02:11:32,488
What happened to that
Justice source of yours?

2159
02:11:32,571 --> 02:11:34,409
I guess I made the instructions
too complicated.

2160
02:11:34,492 --> 02:11:36,872
Because he thought I said "hang up"
when I just said "hang on."

-Oh, Jesus!
-The story is right.

2162

Haldeman was the fifth name
to control that fund...

2163
02:11:41,130 --> 02:11:44,218
-and Sloan would've told the Grand Jury.
-Sloan wanted to tell the Jury.

2164
02:11:44,301 --> 02:11:45,721
-Why didn't he?
-Because nobody asked.

2165
02:11:45,805 --> 02:11:47,266
Nobody asked him.

2166
02:11:47,349 --> 02:11:49,186
The cover-up had little to do
with the break-in.

2167
02:11:49,270 --> 02:11:51,816
It was to protect covert operations
and the covert activities...

2168
02:11:51,899 --> 02:11:54,279
involving the entire
U.S. intelligence community.

2169

Did Deep Throat say
that people's lives are in danger?

2170
02:11:57,076 --> 02:11:58,161
Yes.

2171
02:11:58,244 --> 02:12:01,918
-What else did he say?
-He said everyone is involved.

of the latest Gallup Poll?

2173

heard of the word "Watergate."

you know, and you put us there.

First Amendment of the Constitution...
