1
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,233
Get up, girl. Get up!

2
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:43,230
Whoa!

3
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:01,424
Little Josey!

4
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:06,066
Come on in. Let's get you cleaned up.

5
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:11,550
Better go.

6
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:27,914
Josey!

7
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,594
Pa!

8
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,786
Ashes to ashes...

9
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,867
...dust to dust...

10
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,512
...the Lord gives...

11
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,432
...the Lord takes away.

12
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:21,432
The name's Anderson.

13
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:26,183
Bloody Bill is what they call me.

14
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:31,590
Redlegs?

15
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:36,667
You'll find them up in Kansas.

16
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:39,673
They're with the Union.

17
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:43,785
And we're going up there
and set things aright.

18
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,990
I'll come with you.

19
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,831
All that a fellow has to do...

20
00:10:24,635 --> 00:10:27,513
...is ride into that Union camp
down there...

21
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:33,072
...raise his right hand and swear you'll
be loyal to the United States.

22
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:36,750
Then he can take up his horse again...

23
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,073
...and go home.

24
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:45,472
They'll give us full amnesty then?

25
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:48,070
Yep.

26
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:51,665
Everyone else has done it but us.

27
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,833
We're the last holdouts.

28
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:09,027
I'm going in. I've had enough.

29
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,025
Better go with them, boy.

30
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:25,584
You coming with us?

31
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,674
I reckon not, Fletcher.

32
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,674
They'll be coming after you.

33
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:35,790
Yep.

34
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,706
There's nowhere to go to get away.

35
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:43,394
I reckon that's true.

36
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,671
Good luck.

37
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,352
Put the rifle down too.

38
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:23,228
- I'll need it for squirrels and such.
- Put it down.

39
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:32,225
Kind of young, ain't you kid, to be
riding with this rabble?

40
00:14:32,635 --> 00:14:36,389
Who you calling rabble,
you blue scumbelly?

41
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:41,871
Hell, we showed these boys, anyway.

42
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,549
Lee might have had to surrender,
but we didn't.

43
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,433
- Shut up, kid.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:48,108
You showed us.

45
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:49,754
Now get in line...

46
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:52,793
...before I kick you so hard you'll
wear your ass for a hat.

47
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,872
Here's the man you asked for, sir.

48
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:07,949
- Fletcher. Good to see you.
- Senator.

49
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:09,184
Well done.

50
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:10,470
Thank you.

51
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:16,829
What the hell is this Redleg doing here?

52
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,914
You said regular federal authorities
would handle this.

53
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:26,310
Captain Terrill is the
regular federal authority now.

54
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,985
Captain Terrill is
a bloodthirsty son of a bitch!

55
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:32,385
He is a looter and a pillager!

56
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:34,273
He's those men's worst enemy!

57
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:37,988
The war's over.

58
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,230
Our side won the war.

59
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,788
Now we must busy ourselves
winning the peace.

60
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:49,586
And Fletcher, there's an old saying:
To the victors belong the spoils.

61
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,070
And there's another old saying, Senator.

62
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:02,228
Don't piss down my back and
tell me it's raining.

63
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:05,510
Which side is this man on, Senator?

64
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:07,825
Easy. He brought them in, didn't he?

65
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:09,793
- All but one.
- Who's that?

66
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:11,704
Josey Wales.

67
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:15,987
Josey Wales.

68
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:26,028
Captain Terrill, I want you to
currycomb the countryside.

69
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:29,433
You beat the brush and root out
everything disloyal...

70
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,906
...from a Shanghai rooster to
a Durham cow!

71
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:36,033
We've got to clean up this country.

72
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:41,305
Now you take 5 men and go up there
and get Josey Wales.

73
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:48,030
Captain Redlegs Terrill and 5 men
against Josey Wales?

74
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,985
We stopped those bushwhackers
pretty good during the war.

75
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,667
You go with Captain Terrill.

76
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:01,114
Bring in this damn
insurrectionist rebel.

77
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,911
Here's the money for bringing
the others...

78
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,623
...and there'll be more
for Josey Wales.

79
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,151
I've had enough of your money, Senator.

80
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,353
Let Wales be.

81
00:17:19,595 --> 00:17:21,028
Let me be.

82
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:23,594
I'm finished with you.

83
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:35,430
All right...

84
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:40,913
...I want you men to raise
your right hands.

85
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:42,349
What for?

86
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,907
So you can pledge loyalty
to the Union.

87
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:48,744
Hell, pledge loyalty to the Union?

88
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:51,350
You ought to have us turn around
and bend over.

89
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:56,827
All raise your right hands so
I can take your oath.

90
00:17:58,595 --> 00:17:59,550
I pledge...

91
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:03,310
...that I will be loyal to
the United States of America.

92
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:06,069
I pledge that I will be loyal...

93
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,875
...to the United States of America.

94
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,394
That I will...

95
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,594
Let's see. I will abide by its law...

96
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:17,666
...that I will never bear arms
against it...

97
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:19,871
I will abide by its law...

98
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:23,425
...that I will never bear arms
against it.

99
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,709
...and recognize...

100
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:29,434
...that it is one nation.

101
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:31,670
And recognize...

102
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:33,229
...that it is one nation.

103
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:35,147
- I ain't doing it.
- Come on, kid.

104
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:37,465
Let's get this over with, damn it!

105
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:39,234
But I been thinking.

106
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,265
I think it's them who owes
an apology.

107
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,465
And I further swear, that though...

108
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:46,704
...I be murderous...

109
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:50,827
Look! That's Josey!

110
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:58,547
Verminous, lying, Missouri scum!

111
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:31,633
Damn you, Senator!

112
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:35,345
You promised me those men would be
decently treated.

113
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:37,711
They were decently treated.

114
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:39,951
They were decently fed...

115
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:42,186
...and then they were decently shot.

116
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,234
These men are common outlaws,
nothing more.

117
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:47,070
Run for it, Fletcher, it's a trap!

118
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:04,910
Josey, we best be on our way.

119
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:07,631
- Get moving, boy.
- They're coming after us.

120
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,627
We've got to take to the brush!

121
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,751
You get going!

122
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,030
You can't get them all.

123
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:13,230
That's a fact.

124
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:14,703
Why you doing it then?

125
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:18,113
I've got nothing better to do.

126
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:20,744
Fletcher was in with them.
It was a trap!

127
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:22,551
Fletcher?

128
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,593
Never would have figured that.

129
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,026
You dumb kid.

130
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:36,552
I've got to tell you something.

131
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:39,113
I'm scared of dying.

132
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:41,029
Move out!

133
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:13,750
You are going after him, after all.

134
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:16,630
Fletcher, I'm giving you a commission.

135
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:20,791
Hound this Wales to kingdom come.

136
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,833
Hound him, Senator?

137
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:27,628
A man like Wales lives by the feud.

138
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:31,987
Because of what you did here today,
I've got to kill him.

139
00:22:33,355 --> 00:22:35,664
He'll have to run for it now.

140
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:39,069
And hell is where he's headed.

141
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:42,390
He'll be waiting there for us, Senator.

142
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:49,745
Don't hold back on account of me.
I can ride.

143
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:53,749
I ain't holding back on account of you,
you thick-headed grasshopper.

144
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:58,347
If we ride in the open, there's enough
posses over in South Missouri...

145
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:00,506
...to start another war.

146
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,435
And if we try riding
instead of thinking...

147
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:07,704
...we'll end up hanging by a rope
by nightfall.

148
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:09,950
Where are we headed?

149
00:23:10,195 --> 00:23:11,105
The Indian Nations.

150
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:14,506
It's a good place to hole up
and get you healed up.

151
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:16,108
Then we'll go get Fletcher?

152
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:19,389
Right, boy.

153
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:22,224
Then we go back and get Fletcher.

154
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:35,270
There's some riders coming up behind us.

155
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:09,630
Get down here, boy.
Lay across his neck.

156
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,433
Keep him down there.

157
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,670
Can you hear me?

158
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:32,304
Now if you see me get up,
you stay there, understand?

159
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,591
If you hear shooting and
me headed back north...

160
00:24:34,835 --> 00:24:37,269
...get back on that horse.
He'll get up with you...

161
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:39,506
...and you head south, now you hear?

162
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:58,027
You can let him up now, boy.

163
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:00,554
Let him up!

164
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:03,148
Get up, goddamn it!

165
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,631
Whupped them again, didn't we?

166
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:13,474
Whupped them again, boy.

167
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:28,025
Ten years I've been ferrying
Kansas Redlegs...

168
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:31,347
...Union Cavalry, Missouri guerrillas...

169
00:25:31,595 --> 00:25:33,153
...you name it!

170
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:35,272
Mad dogs, them guerrillas!

171
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:37,631
You look sideways at them...

172
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:39,428
...they kill you!

173
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,027
Hard men to do business with.

174
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:43,549
You bet!

175
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,666
You know, in my line of work...

176
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:49,225
...you got to be able either to sing
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic"...

177
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:52,387
...or "Dixie" with equal enthusiasm...

178
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:55,229
...depending upon present company.

179
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:58,633
Can't say as I blame you for that.

180
00:25:58,915 --> 00:26:01,713
Only good business to play it safe.

181
00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:04,674
Thank God they all been disarmed now...

182
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,025
...except for a few of the
nastiest ones...

183
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,505
...who they're busy running down.

184
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:13,031
Where I'm going, they know
how to handle that kind.

185
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,034
Where are you headed?

186
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,311
I'm going to ply my wares down in Texas.

187
00:26:18,155 --> 00:26:19,827
Texas, huh?

188
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:23,305
How much for the ferry ride?

189
00:26:23,555 --> 00:26:25,147
10 cents.

190
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:29,867
By coincidence, I happen to have a
bottle of this remarkable elixir...

191
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,468
...for that exact amount.

192
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,752
I wish I was in the land of cotton

193
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:37,549
Old times there is not forgotten

194
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:40,150
Look away look away

195
00:26:40,355 --> 00:26:42,585
Look away Dixieland

196
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:48,110
Sim Carstairs is the name.

197
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:49,390
Mister...?

198
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,305
Figured we'd give you some
ferrying business.

199
00:26:53,275 --> 00:26:54,867
With pleasure!

200
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:59,668
Bill Quantrill used this ferry
all the time.

201
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:01,634
Good friend of mine.

202
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:03,789
What have you got there?

203
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:08,067
Just the store with
Granny Hawkins up there.

204
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,072
I'll tell you what.

205
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:13,988
We'll all just amble over to that store.

206
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:17,113
Him and me will ride.
We've got a touch of the cramp.

207
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:18,350
You're in luck!

208
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,473
I just happen to have the perfect thing
here for cramps.

209
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,266
We'll need half a side of bacon...

210
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:29,066
...ten pounds of beef jerky,
twenty pounds of horse grain.

211
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,944
And when we get over there, there won't
be any need for you to go inside.

212
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:36,910
Just tell Old Granny through the door
we'll need a lot of clean bandages...

213
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:41,148
...and a boiled poultice for a
bullet wound in a hurry. Come on.

214
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:57,785
So you'll be Josey Wales.

215
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:01,986
How might you know that, Granny?

216
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:04,590
Soldiers were here looking
for you 2 hours ago.

217
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:09,271
I was going to mention that to you
as soon as I got the chance.

218
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:11,187
They say you killed your own men.

219
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:13,505
Those lying blue scumbellies!

220
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:16,673
They say you're a hard-put
and desperate man.

221
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:20,473
They're going to heel and hog you
to a barn door.

222
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:23,268
You know what I say?

223
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:24,905
What's that?

224
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:27,794
I say that big talk's worth
diddlysquat.

225
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:31,988
Now them poultices be laced with
feather moss and mustard root.

226
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:35,671
Mind you drop water on them
occasionally and keep them damp.

227
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:37,624
Much obliged, Granny.

228
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,992
You can pay me when you see me again,
Josey Wales.

229
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:45,267
I reckon so.

230
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:03,911
That sure is a sweet sound
to the ears...

231
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,305
...wouldn't you say so, Mr. Wales?

232
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:08,432
Your young friend can use some help.

233
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:10,347
This is it. One dollar a bottle.

234
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,665
It works wonders on wounds.

235
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:14,826
Works wonders on
just about everything.

236
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:17,066
It can do most anything.

237
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:20,666
How is it with stains?

238
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,833
Here we go.

239
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:52,347
Dismount. Disembark, children.

240
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:55,189
Get that back!

241
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:56,868
Bring it back!

242
00:29:57,995 --> 00:29:59,667
Bring that barge back!

243
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:02,185
Bring it back!

244
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:04,232
Whupped them again, Josey.

245
00:30:04,475 --> 00:30:06,670
They're hollering for me to come over!

246
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:09,026
I can't hold on.

247
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:13,230
But I'll hold on until you fellows
get out of sight.

248
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:14,908
All right?

249
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:17,066
I'll make do something's wrong...

250
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,668
Pull, Lemuel. Pull!

251
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:22,351
I'll make do something's wrong,
until you get going.

252
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,748
I wish you all lots of luck.

253
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,231
Pull, Lemuel, pull!

254
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:34,626
He ain't going to hold up no ferry.

255
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,708
He's going to bring that cavalry
over fast as he can.

256
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:43,550
Reckon there's a nice reward out
for us about now.

257
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:55,394
We got him now.

258
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:58,149
We'll get those two first,
then the others.

259
00:30:58,395 --> 00:30:59,669
What others?

260
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:01,906
Wales and the kid are the last ones.

261
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,386
Texas is full of rebels.

262
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:07,546
Lots of work to do down in Texas.

263
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:10,070
We get Josey Wales and it ends.

264
00:31:11,355 --> 00:31:13,232
Doing right ain't got no end.

265
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:21,426
We best hurry on, Josey.

266
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:24,947
They'd catch up to us
by the end of the day.

267
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:27,550
Judging by these tracks,
there's maybe...

268
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:30,229
...40, 50 horses ahead of us.

269
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:34,309
What we've got to do is space some time
between them and us.

270
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:36,913
What are we going to do?

271
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:39,587
Stay right here.

272
00:31:42,315 --> 00:31:43,270
Welcome.

273
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:45,267
Welcome, gentlemen.

274
00:31:58,475 --> 00:31:59,351
Pull, Lemuel.

275
00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:02,145
He's still there.

276
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:04,267
What does he think he's doing?

277
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:06,234
Don't know.

278
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:08,943
Some of you men get down there.
Prepare to fire.

279
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,188
Captain Redlegs...

280
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:14,474
...I advise you to turn back.

281
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:16,307
You can catch him later.

282
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:19,149
Turn back? Are you crazy?

283
00:32:19,555 --> 00:32:21,307
He'll try to pick us off one by one.

284
00:32:22,195 --> 00:32:23,423
He'll never do it.

285
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,586
At best, he'll get 2 or 3 up front.

286
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:30,304
I advise you to turn back, Captain.

287
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:32,065
They're coming.

288
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:59,793
Do you really think you can shoot
all those men down...

289
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:01,991
...before they shoot you?

290
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:05,553
No, Mr. Josey Wales!

291
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:09,583
There is such a thing in this country
called justice.

292
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:13,985
Well, Mr. Carpetbagger...

293
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:16,784
...we've got something in this
territory...

294
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:20,671
...called the Missouri boat ride.

295
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:43,864
God Almighty!

296
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,590
Is it bad?

297
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:19,268
It's bad.

298
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:22,147
Don't look at it, boy.

299
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:25,154
It'll just make you get feelings in it.

300
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:31,111
If I don't make it...

301
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:32,908
...I want you to know...

302
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,669
...I'm prouder than a game rooster
to have rid with you.

303
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:38,147
You are a game rooster.
Now shut up.

304
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:41,072
You could make it without me.

305
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,512
Take a little drink of this.

306
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:02,347
This here linsey-woolsey shirt I got
that all you boys wore.

307
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:05,551
We didn't have no ma.

308
00:35:07,635 --> 00:35:10,707
So Pa did all the
fancy needlework for me.

309
00:35:13,115 --> 00:35:15,106
Told me not to tell no one.

310
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,624
Imagine a grown man doing that
for his own kid?

311
00:35:23,795 --> 00:35:26,434
Sang a little song while he sewed it.

312
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:29,585
You know Rose of Alabama?

313
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:35,024
River rolled
The crickets sang

314
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:38,233
The lightning bug
He flashed his wing

315
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:41,109
And I could rope
My arms I fling

316
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,915
'Round Rose of Alabama

317
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,872
Now you just do that, cousin.
You bring that old pistol right out.

318
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:01,668
We got him, Lige.

319
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:04,273
It's him, Abe. It's him.

320
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:06,073
We got the Josey Wales, Abe!

321
00:36:06,315 --> 00:36:09,705
I seen him ride side by side
with Bloody Bill.

322
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,668
We got reward money coming.

323
00:36:12,715 --> 00:36:13,670
Watch it, Abe.

324
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:16,145
He's meaner than a rattler
and twice as fast!

325
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:19,592
You're a real bush hog,
ain't you, Mr. Josey Wales?

326
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:20,785
Tell you what.

327
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:23,629
Move on back. Move on back!

328
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,911
Watch him.
I seen him do some things.

329
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:27,508
Shut up, Lige!

330
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:34,354
Now...

331
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,987
...Mr. Josey Wales...

332
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:38,948
I'd just as soon shoot you now...

333
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:42,870
...except it'd be hard to drag your body
to where we can get our price for you.

334
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:43,991
Shoot him now!

335
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,907
Shut up, Lige.

336
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:50,869
Move your left hand down and
unbuckle that pistol belt.

337
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:53,986
Make it nice and slow...

338
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,625
...so I can count the hairs
on that hand.

339
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:19,343
See, Lige?

340
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:22,712
You pull his teeth...

341
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:25,833
...he's harmless as a heel hound.

342
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:31,548
Always wanted to face out one of these
pistol fighters they all fuss about.

343
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:33,988
Only way you handle them.

344
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,112
Abe, watch out.

345
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:39,149
- He's probably got another pistol...
- Shut up, Lige.

346
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:42,389
Call Benny back there on the horse.

347
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:44,906
Benny! Come out!

348
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:47,665
We got us the Josey Wales!

349
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:53,828
Who is that?

350
00:37:55,435 --> 00:37:57,471
He's just a boy. He's got a fever.

351
00:37:58,595 --> 00:37:59,664
Tell him to shut up.

352
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:05,790
Pa?

353
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:07,184
Is that you, Pa?

354
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:08,988
It ain't your pa!

355
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:10,065
Now shut up!

356
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:14,592
I got the gold right here, Pa.

357
00:38:15,995 --> 00:38:17,553
What gold is he talking about?

358
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:19,988
There's no gold. He's crazy.

359
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:22,430
The gold me and Josey robbed
from the bank.

360
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:28,511
Take a look under that blanket.

361
00:38:30,315 --> 00:38:31,953
I got it right here.

362
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,313
Thought you could use some help.

363
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:57,753
You get those holes leaking, I'm going
to whomp you with a knotted plow-line.

364
00:38:58,395 --> 00:39:00,033
They ain't honest.

365
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:02,869
I feel as pert as a rutting buck.

366
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:05,264
Good.

367
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,149
Because I ain't hauling you
all over hell's creation...

368
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,670
...dribbling blood over
half of Missouri.

369
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:15,625
Wish we had time to bury them fellows.

370
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:18,466
To hell with them fellows.

371
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:23,627
Buzzards got to eat, same as worms.

372
00:39:44,835 --> 00:39:47,303
A real frog strangler.

373
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:52,986
10, 20 more miles and we'll be
safe in the Nations.

374
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:03,993
Some cavalry between us and the Nations.

375
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,465
We'll have to wait
till they bed down...

376
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:08,228
...then walk through quiet.

377
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:10,706
Here, have some beef jerky.

378
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,426
Don't swallow nothing but the juice.
I'll go have a look-see.

379
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:16,068
You feel all right?

380
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:19,393
I feel real good, Josey.
We got them whupped.

381
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:24,184
I want to thank you.

382
00:40:24,435 --> 00:40:25,311
For what?

383
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:27,463
For saving my life.

384
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:30,473
Forget about that, Jamie.

385
00:40:30,715 --> 00:40:32,467
You know something, Josey?

386
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,388
I ain't scared no more.

387
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,394
We can start working our way
through now, boy.

388
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:13,751
This rain is giving us the...

389
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:39,552
This boy was brought up in a...

390
00:41:40,075 --> 00:41:42,714
...time of blood and dying,
and never questioned a bit of it.

391
00:41:43,555 --> 00:41:46,433
Never turned his back
on his folks or his kind.

392
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:51,512
I rode with him, I got no complaints.

393
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:56,427
The bluebellies will give you
a better burial than I can, boy.

394
00:43:42,675 --> 00:43:44,631
My name is Josey Wales.

395
00:43:45,555 --> 00:43:47,671
I've heard of that name.

396
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:51,634
Some said you'd be headed this way.

397
00:43:53,035 --> 00:43:57,074
And they said a man could get rich
on reward money...

398
00:43:57,315 --> 00:43:58,748
...if he could kill you.

399
00:43:59,155 --> 00:44:02,545
Seems like you were looking
to gain some money here.

400
00:44:03,155 --> 00:44:06,147
Actually, I was looking
to gain an edge.

401
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:10,869
I thought you might be someone who
would sneak up behind me with a gun.

402
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:13,584
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?

403
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:16,754
It ain't supposed to be easy
to sneak up behind an Indian.

404
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:20,310
I'm an Indian, all right.

405
00:44:20,835 --> 00:44:24,623
But here in the Nation,
they call us the civilized tribe.

406
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:29,873
They call us civilized because
we're easy to sneak up on.

407
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:35,194
White men have been sneaking up
on us for years.

408
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:37,747
Cherokee, huh?

409
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:45,151
They sneaked up on us and they
told us we wouldn't be happy here.

410
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:48,666
They said we would be happier
in the Nations.

411
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:52,188
So they took away our land...

412
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:54,232
...and sent us here.

413
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:58,464
I have a fine woman...

414
00:44:59,475 --> 00:45:01,227
...and two sons.

415
00:45:01,475 --> 00:45:04,672
But they all died on the
Trail of Tears.

416
00:45:07,075 --> 00:45:11,546
And now the white man
is sneaking up on me.

417
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:14,225
Again.

418
00:45:20,395 --> 00:45:22,750
Seems like we can't trust
the white man.

419
00:45:22,995 --> 00:45:25,190
You bet we can't.

420
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:29,187
I wore this...

421
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:32,589
...frock coat in Washington.

422
00:45:32,835 --> 00:45:34,268
Before the war.

423
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:37,794
We wore them because we belonged to...

424
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,105
...the five civilized tribes.

425
00:45:42,515 --> 00:45:45,473
We dressed ourselves up
like Abraham Lincoln.

426
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:53,706
We got to see the
Secretary of the Interior.

427
00:45:54,715 --> 00:45:56,228
And he said...

428
00:45:57,315 --> 00:45:59,875
..."Boy! You boys sure look civilized!"

429
00:46:01,235 --> 00:46:03,430
He congratulated us...

430
00:46:03,675 --> 00:46:07,384
...and he gave us medals for
looking so civilized.

431
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:11,184
We told him about how
our land had been stolen...

432
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:13,631
...and our people were dying.

433
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:17,834
When we finished, he shook our hands...

434
00:46:18,115 --> 00:46:19,343
...and said...

435
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:23,073
..."Endeavor to persevere."

436
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:25,432
They stood us in a line.

437
00:46:25,675 --> 00:46:28,633
John Jumper, Chilly Mclntosh...

438
00:46:29,475 --> 00:46:31,033
...Buffalo Hump...

439
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:34,790
...and Jim Pock Mark and me.

440
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:36,229
I'm Lone Watie.

441
00:46:36,635 --> 00:46:38,546
They took our pictures.

442
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:41,270
And the newspaper said...

443
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:46,186
..." Indians Vow to
Endeavor to Persevere."

444
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,264
We thought about it for a long time.

445
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:52,230
"Endeavor to persevere."

446
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:56,504
And when we had thought
about it long enough...

447
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:59,594
...we declared war on the Union.

448
00:47:13,315 --> 00:47:16,864
Sergeant said this kid tried to ride
through their camp. They got him.

449
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,107
They did, did they?

450
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:23,670
They've had men on guard here
night and day.

451
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:25,986
No way Wales could get to the Nations.

452
00:47:31,355 --> 00:47:33,186
Where are you going, Fletcher?

453
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,790
I'm heading into the Indian Nations.

454
00:47:36,035 --> 00:47:38,230
Why don't you stay here, Redlegs?

455
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:41,184
Wales may be back in a year or two.

456
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:47,387
When we get to the Nations,
I want you men to fan out.

457
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:50,149
$5000 to the one who gets him.

458
00:48:08,995 --> 00:48:12,271
A horned toad can tell you
which way to go.

459
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:16,025
I used to know these things
when I was young.

460
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:19,948
But when I got civilized,
I forgot all these things.

461
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:22,026
I didn't know which way to go.

462
00:48:22,435 --> 00:48:25,472
The horned toad says
we should go to Mexico.

463
00:48:32,795 --> 00:48:35,070
Well, Mr. Lone Watie...

464
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:40,112
...you can take your horned toad
down Mexico way.

465
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,349
I've got some unfinished
business in Missouri.

466
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:46,390
I heard General Joe Shelby...

467
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:49,388
...and some men refused to surrender.

468
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,227
They're going down to Mexico.

469
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:52,794
I think I'll join them.

470
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:54,794
Shelby, huh?

471
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:56,912
I didn't know others hadn't surrendered.

472
00:48:57,275 --> 00:48:59,072
I didn't surrender, neither.

473
00:48:59,315 --> 00:49:02,864
But they took my horse
and made him surrender.

474
00:49:03,115 --> 00:49:06,187
They have him pulling a wagon
up in Kansas, I'll bet.

475
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,827
You haven't got a horse.

476
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:13,464
What do you plan on doing,
walking to Mexico?

477
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:16,548
No, there's a trading post
right near the Creek Nation.

478
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:18,592
They got horses to trade.

479
00:49:20,115 --> 00:49:21,673
You have any food here?

480
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:26,272
All I have is a piece of
hard rock candy.

481
00:49:27,675 --> 00:49:29,233
But it's not for eating.

482
00:49:29,475 --> 00:49:31,625
It's just for looking through.

483
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:36,194
All right.

484
00:49:40,195 --> 00:49:42,026
I'll get you a horse.

485
00:50:04,475 --> 00:50:05,749
What have you got there?

486
00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:07,030
Muskrat.

487
00:50:07,275 --> 00:50:08,674
Muskrat?

488
00:50:08,915 --> 00:50:09,950
What the hell's that?

489
00:50:10,195 --> 00:50:11,514
Muskrat.

490
00:50:12,515 --> 00:50:15,473
No, sir.
You got to come up with something more.

491
00:50:16,155 --> 00:50:17,986
- Beaver?
- Beaver ain't no good no more.

492
00:50:18,235 --> 00:50:20,032
Get me 10 muskrats...

493
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:22,710
...and 30 beaver pelts...

494
00:50:23,035 --> 00:50:24,991
...and I'll give you red cloth.

495
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:28,630
Now that's a very good bargain for you.

496
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,069
Here.

497
00:50:33,355 --> 00:50:36,153
You go have a drink and think about it.

498
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:56,025
You bring some drink inside, you hear?

499
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:07,783
I'll tell you, this jerky?

500
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:09,548
Put it on our bill.

501
00:51:10,355 --> 00:51:12,027
What about these cougar pelts?

502
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:14,311
Going to put them on our bill too?

503
00:51:18,515 --> 00:51:20,631
This what you give those Indians.

504
00:51:21,715 --> 00:51:22,830
Where's the real stuff?

505
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,787
What do you take for the squaw?

506
00:51:41,195 --> 00:51:42,833
She ain't for sale.

507
00:51:44,995 --> 00:51:46,986
I mean, she ain't mine.

508
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:49,192
She works here.

509
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:53,749
See that nose scar?

510
00:51:56,075 --> 00:51:58,111
Know what that means to a Cheyenne?

511
00:51:58,355 --> 00:51:59,947
One too many bucks.

512
00:52:00,915 --> 00:52:03,031
Little squaw likes the bucks, huh?

513
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:06,073
Tell you, Zukie, you put her
on the bill too.

514
00:52:36,475 --> 00:52:38,386
I'll be looking for a horse.

515
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:40,470
A horse?

516
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:44,110
The horses belong to these gentlemen.

517
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:46,865
More than likely...
That is...

518
00:52:47,115 --> 00:52:49,265
...I'm sure they'd sell you one.

519
00:52:56,195 --> 00:52:58,186
Look, I've got some beer.

520
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,193
Some good brewed choc.

521
00:53:02,395 --> 00:53:03,350
It's on the house.

522
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:21,233
You suppose these gentlemen will be...

523
00:53:21,475 --> 00:53:24,194
...available to discuss business
before long?

524
00:53:29,755 --> 00:53:31,825
Give me a bucket of that choc.

525
00:53:41,035 --> 00:53:41,911
I got him!

526
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:44,472
I got me Josey Wales!

527
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:51,352
5000 gold simoleons walked right in.

528
00:53:51,755 --> 00:53:53,666
- Right to us.
- Wait a minute!

529
00:53:53,915 --> 00:53:55,109
He's in my place.

530
00:53:55,555 --> 00:53:56,670
I recognized him too.

531
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,509
I'm due an even split.

532
00:54:03,075 --> 00:54:06,226
Mr. Chain-Blue Lightning himself.

533
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:11,348
The one that everyone's so scared of.

534
00:54:12,075 --> 00:54:13,872
Well, Mr. Lightning...

535
00:54:14,515 --> 00:54:17,746
...move a muscle, twitch a finger...

536
00:54:17,995 --> 00:54:20,463
...and I'll splatter your guts
all over the wall.

537
00:54:24,235 --> 00:54:25,827
When I say move...

538
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:27,793
...you move real slow...

539
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,912
...like molasses in wintertime.

540
00:54:30,235 --> 00:54:31,827
All right, drop that hammer.

541
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,545
Now, just ease your hands down.

542
00:54:36,435 --> 00:54:40,428
Take them guns out, butt first
so's you can get hold of them.

543
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:43,504
You understand?

544
00:54:45,355 --> 00:54:46,674
Nod, damn you!

545
00:54:51,275 --> 00:54:52,310
Now...

546
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:55,384
...ease them pistols out.

547
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:28,033
Well, let's see...

548
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,549
...you say those horses belong
to them pilgrims?

549
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:12,345
I'm getting better at sneaking up
on you like this.

550
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:15,303
Only an Indian can do
something like this.

551
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:18,703
That's what I figured.

552
00:56:19,235 --> 00:56:20,304
You figured?

553
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:24,075
Only an Indian could do
something like that.

554
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,354
It's not right, this damn woman
doing something like this to me.

555
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:44,393
I used to have power.

556
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,785
Now old age is creeping up on me.

557
00:56:48,555 --> 00:56:52,548
I think it's more like
old habits than old age.

558
00:56:53,715 --> 00:56:55,512
Who the hell is this woman?

559
00:56:56,555 --> 00:56:59,911
She was back at the trading post.
Got in some kind of trouble.

560
00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:02,910
She's not going to Mexico with us.

561
00:57:03,155 --> 00:57:03,985
With us?

562
00:57:04,235 --> 00:57:07,386
Now wait a minute. I got you a horse.
You're on your own now.

563
00:57:07,595 --> 00:57:09,108
I've seen a lot today.

564
00:57:09,355 --> 00:57:12,825
I've seen patrols of soldiers all day.

565
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:15,989
Everybody's looking for you.

566
00:57:17,995 --> 00:57:19,508
She's not going with us.

567
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:35,231
She says she's Navajo...

568
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:38,069
...but she was captured
by the Cheyenne.

569
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:41,990
She was violated by one of the bucks
of the Arapahos.

570
00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:44,749
Their sign is the dirty nose sign.

571
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:47,270
Cheyenne Chief, Black Kettle...

572
00:57:47,515 --> 00:57:51,303
...figures that she did not
resist enough.

573
00:57:59,515 --> 00:58:02,154
Hell, man, can't you get
her to shut up?

574
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:27,751
Anyway, she says...

575
00:58:27,995 --> 00:58:30,589
...when she came to that trading post...

576
00:58:30,835 --> 00:58:33,713
...she didn't know this man,
Zukie Limmer...

577
00:58:33,955 --> 00:58:35,354
...was selling liquor.

578
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,870
She also wants you to know...

579
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,310
...that although he beat her a lot...

580
00:58:40,555 --> 00:58:42,989
...nothing happened between them.

581
00:58:44,435 --> 00:58:47,029
And she says you are a great warrior...

582
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:51,905
...and that she sort of belongs to you
for what you done for her.

583
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:56,187
Look, you tell her I don't want
nobody belonging to me.

584
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:00,826
That meal was damn good.

585
00:59:01,075 --> 00:59:05,034
I'm going to take up tepee living
if it's like this.

586
00:59:06,315 --> 00:59:09,625
You know, she thinks I'm some kind
of a Cherokee chief.

587
00:59:11,355 --> 00:59:14,188
I wonder where she ever got that idea.

588
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:22,549
Chief!

589
00:59:30,715 --> 00:59:32,353
I was just wondering.

590
00:59:32,595 --> 00:59:35,826
I suppose that mangy hound's
got no place else to go either.

591
00:59:40,475 --> 00:59:42,909
He might as well ride along with us.

592
00:59:43,395 --> 00:59:45,590
Hell, everybody else is.

593
01:00:31,075 --> 01:00:32,190
Hey, you!

594
01:00:33,315 --> 01:00:34,873
Want to buy some Indian scalps?

595
01:01:39,515 --> 01:01:40,914
Nasty habit, young fellow.

596
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,146
You born in the barn?

597
01:01:56,315 --> 01:02:00,103
The wheat is from Kansas and the
molasses comes from Missouri.

598
01:02:00,355 --> 01:02:01,788
We'll do without molasses.

599
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:04,344
Anything from Missouri
has a taint about it.

600
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:07,667
Grandma, you've got to tread
lightly now we're here in Texas.

601
01:02:07,915 --> 01:02:10,304
Lots of nice elements from
Missouri coming West.

602
01:02:10,555 --> 01:02:14,628
Nothing nice comes from Missouri.
And treading lightly is not my way.

603
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:17,389
We're from Kansas.
Jayhawkers, and proud of it.

604
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:20,024
I know how you feel.
I'm a Hoosier, myself.

605
01:02:20,435 --> 01:02:23,472
Personally, I don't think much
of Hoosiers neither.

606
01:02:33,715 --> 01:02:34,989
Yes, friends, yes!

607
01:02:35,235 --> 01:02:38,227
This is a positive remedy
for weariness...

608
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:41,751
...turgidity of the bowels and...

609
01:02:44,395 --> 01:02:46,784
Say, you're an Indian, aren't you?

610
01:02:49,435 --> 01:02:51,232
You speak any English?

611
01:02:51,675 --> 01:02:54,348
Well, sir, this is the
very best thing...

612
01:02:54,595 --> 01:02:57,029
...for those who can't handle
their liquor.

613
01:03:00,315 --> 01:03:01,748
What's in it?

614
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:07,386
I don't know. Various things.
I'm only the salesman.

615
01:03:09,155 --> 01:03:10,190
You drink it.

616
01:03:10,435 --> 01:03:11,629
What's that?

617
01:03:13,435 --> 01:03:14,868
You drink it.

618
01:03:22,475 --> 01:03:24,989
What can you expect from a nonbeliever?

619
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:29,544
That old lady don't know the trouble
she can get into talking like that.

620
01:03:30,155 --> 01:03:32,623
Too many folks around here
with thin skin.

621
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,594
Lots of Southern boys
been getting into trouble here.

622
01:03:35,835 --> 01:03:39,987
Cullen Baker and Captain Bob Lee
been fighting over in Fannin County.

623
01:03:40,235 --> 01:03:41,987
Bill Longley, Creed Taylor...

624
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:45,108
...and all them other Taylors
down in Gonzalez.

625
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:47,664
Killed Simp Dixon over in Cotton Gin...

626
01:03:47,915 --> 01:03:49,712
...weighted him down with lead.

627
01:03:50,755 --> 01:03:53,144
I got a picture postcard of it.

628
01:03:53,995 --> 01:03:56,225
Here. Have a look.

629
01:03:58,315 --> 01:03:59,430
Josey Wales.

630
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:04,705
What say?

631
01:04:04,955 --> 01:04:07,389
Josey Wales.
They say he's coming into Texas.

632
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:10,627
Won't come through here though.
Killed 50, 60 men.

633
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:13,912
Regulators are all over the place
looking for him.

634
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:16,990
How much for all this?

635
01:04:17,235 --> 01:04:18,350
Three dollars.

636
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:21,112
Those regulators would pay plenty...

637
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:24,267
...to the man who could
identify Josey Wales.

638
01:04:25,755 --> 01:04:27,393
Reckon so.

639
01:04:37,395 --> 01:04:38,464
How about you, sir?

640
01:04:38,715 --> 01:04:41,752
Just a few bottles left.
You won't regret it.

641
01:04:49,195 --> 01:04:50,674
Oh, my God!

642
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:52,308
It's Josey Wales!

643
01:05:21,555 --> 01:05:24,115
You going to pull those pistols
or whistle "Dixie"?

644
01:06:20,035 --> 01:06:21,150
Goddamn Indian squaw!

645
01:06:24,235 --> 01:06:25,270
Let's go!

646
01:07:00,995 --> 01:07:03,589
Welcome to Texas, Mr. Lone Watie.

647
01:07:05,035 --> 01:07:09,108
I guess we ain't going to see that
little Navajo girl again.

648
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:10,947
I guess not.

649
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:13,072
I kind of liked her.

650
01:07:13,315 --> 01:07:15,624
- But it's always like that.
- Like what?

651
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:19,394
Whenever I get to liking someone,
they ain't around long.

652
01:07:19,795 --> 01:07:24,346
I notice when you get to disliking
someone they ain't around long neither.

653
01:07:27,475 --> 01:07:30,228
How did you know which one
was going to shoot first?

654
01:07:31,435 --> 01:07:33,710
That one in the center
had a flap holster...

655
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:35,991
...and he was in no itching hurry.

656
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,353
And the one second from the left...

657
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:40,950
...had scared eyes.
He wasn't going to do nothing.

658
01:07:41,195 --> 01:07:42,947
But that one on the far left...

659
01:07:43,195 --> 01:07:46,585
...had crazy eyes.
Figured him to make the first move.

660
01:07:46,835 --> 01:07:48,234
And the one on the right?

661
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,026
Never paid no him no mind.

662
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:56,344
You were there.

663
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:02,990
I could have missed.

664
01:08:03,235 --> 01:08:05,954
Yes, sir! It was Josey Wales,
all right!

665
01:08:06,195 --> 01:08:09,153
Saw him heading north out of town
with a renegade Injun.

666
01:08:10,195 --> 01:08:11,674
I can identify him.

667
01:08:11,915 --> 01:08:15,794
And I'd certainly be glad
to share in any reward.

668
01:08:16,595 --> 01:08:19,063
Knew him quite well, actually.

669
01:08:21,755 --> 01:08:24,064
Well, not a hard man to track.

670
01:08:24,635 --> 01:08:26,910
Leaves dead men wherever he goes.

671
01:08:27,995 --> 01:08:29,747
He's heading north now...

672
01:08:30,195 --> 01:08:32,186
...riding with a renegade Indian.

673
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,789
He's heading north now,
but he'll turn southwest...

674
01:08:36,035 --> 01:08:37,388
...head for Mexico.

675
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:40,388
Then we'll turn southwest
and head for Mexico.

676
01:08:40,835 --> 01:08:42,712
Tell them to head north.

677
01:08:43,235 --> 01:08:45,032
What are you talking about?

678
01:08:47,675 --> 01:08:51,554
Look at those boys over there
with tied-down guns.

679
01:08:53,235 --> 01:08:54,827
Bounty hunters.

680
01:08:55,355 --> 01:08:58,870
Come out of a war, got no other way
to make a living.

681
01:08:59,675 --> 01:09:03,509
Every last mother's son of them wants
that money you've got on Wales' head.

682
01:09:04,395 --> 01:09:06,989
You and me didn't ride
all that way for that.

683
01:09:08,595 --> 01:09:10,870
I don't want to hear Wales is dead.

684
01:09:12,355 --> 01:09:14,391
I want to see Wales dead.

685
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:21,149
We're heading north, men.
Let's ride.

686
01:09:41,915 --> 01:09:43,030
They're following us.

687
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:49,271
Couple of horses, far off, moving fast.

688
01:09:50,915 --> 01:09:52,030
I don't hear nothing.

689
01:09:53,915 --> 01:09:56,065
Got to be an Indian to know
those things.

690
01:10:00,995 --> 01:10:03,304
All right, let's take them
out in the sand.

691
01:11:12,995 --> 01:11:16,351
Glad you stopped me when you did.
I might have killed her.

692
01:11:16,675 --> 01:11:18,393
I noticed that.

693
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:26,658
She got some supplies...

694
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,468
...and our horses...

695
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,701
...and followed us around.

696
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:34,068
She said we were the only kin she had.

697
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,546
I bet we are, at that.

698
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:40,389
You know, every man I ever knew...

699
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,860
...who was good with a gun and lived...

700
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,146
...always had an edge.

701
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:49,306
Some of them would like to have
the sun behind their back.

702
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,502
That's always a good idea.

703
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:57,784
Sure pays to have an edge.

704
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,785
All kind of edges.

705
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:44,460
Howdy.

706
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:47,499
Is something wrong?

707
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:51,061
I guess you were right.

708
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:53,780
I ain't that old, after all.

709
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:27,501
Not many men west of here.

710
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:30,783
We're getting into Comanche country.

711
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,303
Wagon tracks.

712
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,144
But I never seen tracks like these.

713
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:43,860
Never heard of Comanches traveling
in two-wheeled carts.

714
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:56,468
Comancheros...

715
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:00,669
...trade liquor and guns
to Comanche for horses.

716
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:03,062
Trade women too.

717
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:04,540
How many?

718
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:07,460
Eight...

719
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,907
...maybe nine horses,
and a couple of carts.

720
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:57,144
Those poor pilgrims from Kansas.

721
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:01,341
They don't look too proud now, do they?

722
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:18,258
You son of a bitch!

723
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,580
Ten Bears is going to want
a fresh woman!

724
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:26,543
Fresh, that little gal will
bring maybe 20 horses.

725
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:33,262
Now if one of you has to,
take that old woman over there.

726
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,469
She might be worth maybe one donkey.

727
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:01,859
Fix yourself.

728
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:16,266
Move faster!

729
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:22,109
If you fall...

730
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:25,228
...they'll let you die.
Keep walking.

731
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:34,300
Come around here, bitch.
Come around here.

732
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:40,338
Now you listen to me.

733
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:43,184
I want you looking real good
when we get to Ten Bears.

734
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:47,748
So I want you to jump in that wagon and
put on one of your best little dresses.

735
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,707
It might boost your price.

736
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:56,384
If you look good enough, I might outbid
old Ten Bears and take you for myself.

737
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,022
If I figure this right...

738
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:36,421
...we're facing the sun.

739
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:39,260
This ought to give him an edge.

740
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:41,742
Who are you talking about?

741
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:43,423
What the hell does he want?

742
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,023
Looks like a parlay.

743
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:55,386
Are you just going to sit there or
you going to see what he wants?

744
01:20:58,030 --> 01:20:59,941
Get ready, little lady.

745
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,466
Hell is coming to breakfast.

746
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:13,265
That's a mighty nice horse
you got there, mister.

747
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:14,909
Would you sell it?

748
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:17,824
We will give you a good price.

749
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,579
Now spit!

750
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:33,660
Just get off the horse.

751
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:40,225
Get out of the way!

752
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,063
Now you'll kill us, I suppose.

753
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:42,380
I'd have been halfway to Mexico by now
except for that crazy squaw.

754
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,621
I can't understand a word she says.

755
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:47,621
I knew that would bring you.

756
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,140
Help us!

757
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,264
Help us.

758
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,228
Comanches.

759
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:13,946
They won't like us killing these friends
of theirs. We better get moving.

760
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:03,868
Looks like a family of hogs just moved
out of the seat of these britches.

761
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:08,148
I had such beautiful clothes...

762
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:10,779
...I was taking to our ranch.

763
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:13,747
Whereabouts is this ranch?

764
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:18,588
My son's ranch, he found before the war
near a town called Santo Rio.

765
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:20,309
Creek with good water...

766
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,745
...trees, cattle, black-tailed deer.

767
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:26,223
It's a regular paradise we're headed to.

768
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:27,944
Out there?

769
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:31,344
Your son told you this was out there?

770
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:34,668
He told me that.
Near a place called Blood Butte.

771
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,380
My son was true-blue, Mr. Wales.

772
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:40,190
He never lied.
It'll be there, all right.

773
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:44,984
Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it will be.

774
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:48,267
Cottonwoods, live oaks...

775
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:50,626
...wild horses...

776
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:52,462
...antelope...

777
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,342
...Iots of quail.

778
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:02,699
You see them?

779
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:04,940
What?

780
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,268
The clouds over there.

781
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,662
Clouds are like...

782
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:15,266
...dreams floating across
a sky-blue mind.

783
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:20,386
I never thought of them that way.

784
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:25,229
Indian...

785
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:29,106
...this Mr. Wales is a
cold-blooded killer.

786
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:30,544
He's from Missouri...

787
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:35,022
...where they're all known to be killers
of innocent men, women and children.

788
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,943
Would you rather be riding with
Comancheros, Granny?

789
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,862
No, I wouldn't.

790
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:08,029
What'll you have?

791
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:12,378
Whiskey.

792
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:14,343
Whiskey, he says!

793
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:17,788
How about something else?

794
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:21,658
Beer, then.

795
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,579
And get those gents whatever
they're drinking.

796
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:25,780
You too, ma'am.

797
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,308
That's mighty decent of you.

798
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:32,587
Been a long time since anybody
bought a drink around here.

799
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:35,663
About as long as we had
anything to drink around here.

800
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:37,787
Or anything else.

801
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:42,739
Yeah, first the silver run out
of the Santo Rio.

802
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:45,021
Then the people run out.

803
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:46,988
Then the whiskey.

804
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:49,346
Then the beer run out.

805
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:50,739
Well, no matter.

806
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,310
It's good to see a high roller
wander through.

807
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:09,861
I didn't mean to offend him.

808
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:13,307
I guess some fellows just don't like to
be called high rollers.

809
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:17,782
You know, I knew a fellow once, he
didn't like to be called highhanded.

810
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,268
We'll have whiskey all around.

811
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:24,228
Comanchero brand.

812
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:33,424
Angels of Mercy come to Santo Rio!

813
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:35,467
This ain't Santo Rio.

814
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:38,304
My son, Tom Turner, said it was
a thriving place.

815
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,063
It was.

816
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:43,268
But when the silver ran out,
the thriving ran out.

817
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:44,579
That's right.

818
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:47,219
I do declare.

819
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:49,301
Might you be the mother of Tom Turner...

820
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:52,462
...whose Crooked River Ranch
is over by Blood Butte?

821
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:54,507
That I might, miss.

822
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,505
I am Rose.

823
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,308
Rose of Santo Rio.

824
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:02,939
I reckon he wrote you all about me.

825
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:05,659
I don't recollect that.

826
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,299
After his Lucy passed on...

827
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,427
...he didn't show much
interest in women.

828
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:16,106
My sonny-boy kept his nose to the
grindstone, providing a future for me...

829
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:17,465
...and his daughter there.

830
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:24,784
I do seem to recall him
telling me something about...

831
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:27,305
...a daughter who was a little...

832
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:28,386
...odd.

833
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:32,421
He was killed in the Border War
by Missouri ruffians.

834
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:35,867
He died a proud member of
Senator Jim Lane's Redlegs...

835
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,229
...fighting for the just cause!

836
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:41,540
I am sorry to hear that.

837
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,668
I mean, he was of the finest sort.

838
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:47,299
Seora, please sit down.

839
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:50,064
You must be very, very tired.

840
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:55,339
I am deeply sorrowed to hear this.

841
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,109
In past years...

842
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:00,626
...my friend and I were of service
to your Tom Turner.

843
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:03,179
And now we are at your service.

844
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:07,900
Why, I appreciate your concern.

845
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:11,381
I am glad to find manners at last,
here in the wilderness.

846
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:15,749
We have endured hardship of the
worst sort on the way out here.

847
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:20,226
Grandpa Samuel and Uncle Enoch...

848
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:23,030
...fell prey to Comancheros.

849
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:26,945
Let's drink to the silver running out.
Gave us some peace and quiet here!

850
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:28,862
Bad luck, the silver running out.

851
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:32,147
I wouldn't have any other kind!

852
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:41,059
What'll you have?

853
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:44,586
I'm looking for Josey Wales.

854
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:48,865
That'll be me.

855
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:54,182
You're wanted, Wales.

856
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:56,506
Reckon I'm right popular.

857
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:00,109
You a bounty hunter?

858
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:03,189
A man's got to do something for
a living these days.

859
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:06,619
Dying ain't much of a living, boy.

860
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:12,426
You know, this isn't necessary.

861
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:15,221
You can just ride on.

862
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:52,858
I had to come back.

863
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:55,139
I know.

864
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:37,859
- Comanche?
- Comanches, all right.

865
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:39,824
Any more of them?

866
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:42,106
I think that's all there is...

867
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,029
...but they have horses
packing antelope...

868
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:47,579
...so I figure they're not
a raiding party.

869
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:50,345
But you never can tell these Comanches.

870
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:52,909
You stay with the cart.

871
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:13,546
Just looking us over, I guess.

872
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:15,821
They're packing heavy.

873
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:17,139
They may return.

874
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:18,948
All right, let's move out.

875
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:28,698
If they ride with Ten Bears...

876
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:30,508
...they will come back.

877
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:34,382
Ten Bears is the greatest
Comanche war chief.

878
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:35,899
But he's angry.

879
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:39,381
Each year, he has met with
one of your bluecoat generals.

880
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:40,619
Ain't my generals.

881
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:44,306
And each year he is pushed further
across the plains.

882
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:47,383
General Sherman has come
with more promises.

883
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:49,985
But Ten Bears will move no more.

884
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:44,299
It's so beautiful.

885
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:55,426
All right, we can get to work
dusting first.

886
01:34:55,990 --> 01:35:00,506
Got a nice Dutch oven
in the fireplace here.

887
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:04,584
Mr. Wales, you men chop some wood.

888
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:07,947
Now, get everything done.

889
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:10,505
Mr. Wales!

890
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:13,470
Did you come all this way to gawk?

891
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:16,419
If you don't work,
you don't eat around here.

892
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:18,740
Didn't figure you for a loafer.

893
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:45,470
You know, she told me...

894
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:49,828
...it's the first time she ever had
a place of her own.

895
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:53,425
Grandma says it's our home.

896
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:55,980
It is all of ours.

897
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:59,907
I'm glad there will be a man
around to take care of things.

898
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:03,343
I'll be dropping back
from time to time...

899
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:06,186
...probably just to hole up.

900
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:09,105
Why don't you stay with us?

901
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:11,347
Be our partner.

902
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:13,984
They won't miss you.

903
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:16,346
Maybe they'll forget you.

904
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:20,699
You know there ain't no forgetting.

905
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:10,299
Pa!

906
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:41,542
Hey, there, Josey!

907
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:48,580
We're going to Santo Rio!

908
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:32,580
Lord...

909
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:36,262
...thanks a lot for bringing us
to this place.

910
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:38,663
Pa and Daniel died...

911
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:42,380
...at the hands of that low-down,
murdering trash out of hell...

912
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:44,348
...that done them in.

913
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:48,180
But they put up a good fight
and died the best they could.

914
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:50,621
And thanks a lot for Josey Wales...

915
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:54,587
...who you changed from a
murdering bushwhacker...

916
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:56,502
...on the side of Satan...

917
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,229
...to a better man...

918
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:01,268
...in time to deliver us
from the Philistines.

919
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:05,709
And thank you, Lord, for
getting us together in Texas.

920
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:14,589
Are you all right?

921
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:15,740
Ten Bears...

922
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:18,106
...he got Travis and Chato.

923
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:20,705
He'll be riding here in the morning.

924
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:41,462
If I was looking for a place
to hole up, I'd pick this one.

925
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:44,099
Walls and ceiling, 2 feet thick.

926
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:46,386
All made out of mud, nothing to burn.

927
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:50,747
Two doors, front and back,
right in sight of one another.

928
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:54,866
These here crosses are to fire rifles
through. Up and down, side to side.

929
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,941
Tom Turner knew what he was doing.

930
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:59,385
You bet.
I'll be shooting out that door.

931
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:01,780
I'd rather have you sit right there...

932
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:04,180
...and do the loading.
Can you do that?

933
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:05,749
I can.

934
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:08,144
Moonlight...

935
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:12,623
...I want you to go to this door.
You fire through here, all right?

936
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:15,430
Laura Lee, right through this window.
Can you shoot?

937
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:16,739
I'll try.

938
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:20,107
Lone, you take this window
right over here, and the door.

939
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:21,783
Where there's the most firing.

940
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:25,989
You'll have to keep an eye on
that hallway there because...

941
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:31,629
...the only blind spot is the ceiling.
They'll get around to it eventually.

942
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:34,304
They can't shoot through it,
but they might...

943
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:37,587
...dig a hole in it and drop down,
maybe in the back bedroom.

944
01:40:39,190 --> 01:40:40,509
Now remember...

945
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:44,142
...when things look bad, and it looks
like you won't make it...

946
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:45,829
...then you got to get mean.

947
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:48,220
I mean plumb, maddog mean!

948
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:52,339
Because if you lose your head and
give up, then you neither live nor win.

949
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:54,309
That's just the way it is.

950
01:40:54,710 --> 01:40:58,305
Use pistols at short range.
More fire power and less reloading.

951
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:01,223
Keep this fire going.
Keep an iron on it red-hot.

952
01:41:01,470 --> 01:41:03,381
Anybody gets hit, slap iron to it.

953
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:05,905
That's the fastest way
to stop the blood.

954
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:11,221
What's all that paint about?

955
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:12,983
It's my death face.

956
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:17,749
You know, we're sure going to show them
redskins something tomorrow!

957
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:19,389
No offense meant.

958
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,108
None taken.

959
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:33,140
Where's he going?

960
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:37,105
He knows he can do the best for us
on the back of a horse.

961
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:38,829
He's a guerrilla fighter.

962
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:42,148
He figures he can carry the fight
to the enemy.

963
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:45,985
He's going down into the valley
to kill Ten Bears...

964
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:48,665
...and as many of the men as he can.

965
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:50,946
How will he do that and come back here?

966
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:53,658
He won't come back.

967
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:22,505
You be Ten Bears?

968
01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:24,868
I am Ten Bears.

969
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:31,142
I'm Josey Wales.

970
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:34,782
I have heard.

971
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:37,542
You're the Gray Rider.

972
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:42,147
You would not make peace with the
Bluecoats. You may go in peace.

973
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:44,819
I reckon not.

974
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:51,545
Got nowhere to go.

975
01:44:52,270 --> 01:44:53,669
Then you will die.

976
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:57,667
I came here to die with you.

977
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:01,343
Or live with you.

978
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:05,668
Dying's not hard for you and me.
It's living that's hard...

979
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:08,788
...when all you ever cared about has
been butchered or raped.

980
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:14,428
Governments don't live together.
People live together.

981
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:19,461
Governments don't give you a fair word
or a fair fight. I've come here to...

982
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:22,349
...give you either one.
Or get either one from you.

983
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:29,066
I came here like this so you'll know
my word of death is true.

984
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:31,705
And that my word of life is then true.

985
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:39,221
The bear lives here, the wolf, the
antelope, the Comanche.

986
01:45:39,670 --> 01:45:41,342
And so will we.

987
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:45,666
We'll only hunt what we need to live on,
same as the Comanche does.

988
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:49,622
And every spring when
the Comanche moves north...

989
01:45:49,870 --> 01:45:51,349
...he can rest here in peace...

990
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:54,980
...butcher some of our cattle
and jerk beef for the journey.

991
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:59,225
The sign of the Comanche,
that will be on our lodge.

992
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:00,585
That's my word of life.

993
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:02,788
And your word of death?

994
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:06,702
It's here in my pistols
and there in your rifles.

995
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:08,218
I'm here for either one.

996
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:12,702
These things you say we will have,
we already have.

997
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:16,825
That's true.
I ain't promising you nothing extra.

998
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:20,387
I'm just giving you life,
and you're giving me life.

999
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:24,259
And I'm saying men can live together
without butchering one another.

1000
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:30,948
It's sad that governments are chiefed
by the double-tongues.

1001
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:35,103
There is iron in your words of death
for all Comanches to see.

1002
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:38,228
And so there is iron
in your words of life.

1003
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:42,226
No signed paper can hold the iron.

1004
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:44,381
It must come from men.

1005
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:49,223
The words of Ten Bears carry
the same iron of life and death.

1006
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:53,828
It is good that warriors such as we
meet in the struggle of life...

1007
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:55,225
...or death.

1008
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:00,181
It shall be life.

1009
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:25,865
So will it be.

1010
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:28,542
I reckon so.

1011
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:33,220
I'll be damned! Look at this!

1012
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,945
Come. Sit down.

1013
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:48,750
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!

1014
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:55,185
Sit down.

1015
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:57,341
I never been so glad to see an Indian.

1016
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:02,150
I've got something to show you,
Mr. Wales.

1017
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:06,226
I made this chain for you.

1018
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:08,381
I braided it from my hair.

1019
01:49:11,110 --> 01:49:13,465
That's real nice. It really is.

1020
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:15,428
It's a watch chain.

1021
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:20,704
It's a nice one. It will come in handy.
I thank you for it.

1022
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:25,500
You do have a watch, don't you?

1023
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:31,379
I've been meaning to get one.

1024
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:34,942
Could we...

1025
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:36,862
...play a song for you?

1026
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:42,462
I'm afraid I don't really know
too many songs.

1027
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:54,748
Could we play something you like?
Come on.

1028
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:58,461
Only song I can think of is
"Rose of Alabama."

1029
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:01,823
We remember that old piece.
Rosie, come here.

1030
01:50:17,270 --> 01:50:18,623
Do you dance?

1031
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:21,309
Me neither.

1032
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:30,867
I could see him through this
window when he shot my partner.

1033
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:34,262
He was traveling with an
old Injun and a squaw...

1034
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,660
...and some old lady and a scrawny girl.

1035
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:41,059
Had to be him. He had this scar
right on his face, right here.

1036
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:43,945
I wasn't about to face him down alone.

1037
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:51,269
You men get them horses out of sight.

1038
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:57,460
If Josey Wales comes back here,
we'll buy him a drink.

1039
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:41,141
Kansas was all...

1040
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:44,981
...golden and smelled like sunshine.

1041
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:51,901
I always heard there were 3 kinds
of suns in Kansas.

1042
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:53,989
Sunshine...

1043
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:56,023
...sunflowers...

1044
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:57,988
...and sons of bitches.

1045
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:04,863
At least that's something.

1046
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:10,945
I heard a joke about Missouri once.

1047
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:14,342
Something about how people
from Missouri...

1048
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:17,343
...are always saying, "Show me."

1049
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:19,908
Do you know it?

1050
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:22,109
I think it was:

1051
01:53:25,630 --> 01:53:28,019
What does a man from Missouri say...

1052
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:32,263
...if someone asks him to see a
Missouri mule?

1053
01:53:33,670 --> 01:53:35,786
He says, "Show me."

1054
01:53:38,190 --> 01:53:39,464
Get it?

1055
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:42,628
They teach dumb jokes to
pretty girls in Kansas.

1056
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:46,942
They teach other things.

1057
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:56,069
Show me.

1058
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:33,383
Pa!

1059
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:09,586
You're up kind of early, aren't you?

1060
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:14,381
It's been nice riding with you.

1061
01:55:15,630 --> 01:55:16,380
Same here.

1062
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:21,463
When you get to town, get some nice
dresses for the ladies, you hear?

1063
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:23,380
I will.

1064
01:55:23,910 --> 01:55:27,823
Get something specially nice for Laura
Lee for when I come back in the spring.

1065
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:36,981
Or the following spring.

1066
01:55:42,630 --> 01:55:45,303
Sometimes trouble just follows a man.

1067
01:55:46,270 --> 01:55:48,704
Hell, I've been here way
too long as it...

1068
01:55:55,190 --> 01:55:56,862
I reckon so.

1069
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:46,349
You're all alone now, Wales.

1070
01:57:47,950 --> 01:57:49,622
Not quite alone.

1071
01:58:28,630 --> 01:58:32,179
Now we're really going to show
these palefaces something!

1072
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:33,465
No offense.

1073
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:34,938
None taken.

1074
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:39,183
These freebooters are a
slander to Kansas...

1075
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:42,228
...attacking innocent women like this.

1076
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:00,739
The bullets were flying...

1077
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:03,868
...and people running every which way.

1078
02:04:04,110 --> 02:04:07,261
Church bells were ringing.
Me and Miss Rose were ducking for cover.

1079
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:10,104
Because one didn't know where
the shots were coming...

1080
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:18,982
Mr. Wilson!

1081
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:20,626
Good morning.

1082
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:23,384
Hello, Mr. Wilson.

1083
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:25,706
We were just telling a little story...

1084
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:29,545
...about an outlaw passed through
this way a while back.

1085
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:31,866
I don't suppose you'd know
about him but...

1086
02:04:32,110 --> 02:04:36,183
These 2 fellows down here is
Texas Rangers.

1087
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:40,219
Been on his trail, along with this
other fellow over here.

1088
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:42,421
What did you say your name was, friend?

1089
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:48,546
Fletcher.

1090
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:51,860
That's right, Mr. Fletcher.

1091
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:54,904
Anyway, they've been chasing
this outlaw...

1092
02:04:55,150 --> 02:04:59,143
...and it just so happens old Ten Spot
here knows all about it.

1093
02:04:59,390 --> 02:05:00,743
Yes, sir.

1094
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:04,699
It was down in Monterey, Mexico,
a little while back.

1095
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:06,788
Anyway, this outlaw fellow...

1096
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:09,624
...he went up against 5 pistoleros.

1097
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:12,868
He got 3 of them
before they cut him down.

1098
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,744
Is that right, Miss Rose?

1099
02:05:14,990 --> 02:05:17,743
That's right. His name was...

1100
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:19,984
...Josey Wales.

1101
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:23,142
Yeah, that's it. Josey Wales.

1102
02:05:25,550 --> 02:05:28,269
If that's what happened,
then Josey Wales must be dead.

1103
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:31,143
He is dead.

1104
02:05:31,590 --> 02:05:34,423
He sure is dead.

1105
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:38,658
Dead, all right.

1106
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:45,348
Will you sign this affidavit?

1107
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:48,629
Sign? I sure will.

1108
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:05,784
That's it.

1109
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:15,341
Nice seeing you, Mr. Wilson.

1110
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:23,704
Must be 5000 lawmen
in Texas right now.

1111
02:06:23,950 --> 02:06:24,939
Can't get them all.

1112
02:06:25,190 --> 02:06:27,181
I guess that's the truth.

1113
02:06:28,070 --> 02:06:30,379
You fellows get back
up this way, stop in.

1114
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:33,224
I reckon we won't be coming
back this way.

1115
02:06:38,350 --> 02:06:41,228
I don't believe that story
about Josey Wales.

1116
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:42,698
You don't?

1117
02:06:43,150 --> 02:06:44,868
No, sir, I don't.

1118
02:06:45,590 --> 02:06:49,503
I don't believe no 5 pistoleros
could do in Josey Wales.

1119
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:52,182
Maybe it was 6.

1120
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:53,829
Could have even been 10.

1121
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:56,823
I think he's still alive.

1122
02:06:57,070 --> 02:06:59,425
Alive? No sir.

1123
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:10,105
I think I'll go down to Mexico
to try to find him.

1124
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:18,985
And then?

1125
02:07:27,590 --> 02:07:29,660
He's got the first move.

1126
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:31,789
I owe him that.

1127
02:07:33,790 --> 02:07:35,940
I'll try to tell him the war is over.

1128
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:53,178
What do you say?

1129
02:08:00,630 --> 02:08:02,188
I reckon so.

1130
02:08:08,990 --> 02:08:11,743
I guess we all died a little
in that damn war.
