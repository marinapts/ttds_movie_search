1
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,114
Are we the first?

2
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,470
Are we the first to arrive here?

3
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:15,694
Is the interpreter with you?

4
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:21,785
I'm not a professional interpreter.
My occupation is cartography.

5
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:23,739
I'm a mapmaker.

6
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:25,682
Can you translate
French into English...

7
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:26,867
and English into French?

8
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:30,246
Yes, I explained to the team leader
in Villa Hermosa.

9
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:33,226
I'm just a little taken by surprise.

10
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:01,335
They're all there. All of them.

11
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,932
Check for landing marks.

12
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,870
Mr. Lacombe wants the numbers
off the engine blocks.

13
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:49,717
M-447148.

14
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:54,305
W-445529.

15
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:57,975
Number 445529, check.

16
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:02,730
Approximately 46 gallons
in the right tank.

17
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:04,938
447149, check.

18
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:07,468
Tell me something.
What's happening here?

19
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:10,128
It's flight number 19.
- 19 what?

20
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:12,209
It's that training mission from the...

21
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:14,308
naval air station
at Fort Lauderdale.

22
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:17,311
They were doing target runs
on an old hulk.

23
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,980
Who flies crates
like these anymore?

24
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,320
No one. These planes
were reported...

25
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,420
missing in 1945.

26
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:31,882
But it looks brand-new.

27
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,971
Where's the pilot?

28
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,851
I don't understand.

29
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,812
Where's the crew? Hey.

30
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,653
How the hell did it get here?.

31
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,962
He says this guy's local.

32
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:28,262
He was here last night.
He saw it happen.

33
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:52,462
Sunburn?

34
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,110
He says the sun came
out last night.

35
00:07:12,484 --> 00:07:14,862
He says it sang to him.

36
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,509
Harry, keep an eye
on that point-out.

37
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,611
He's on 122.5.

38
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,819
I'll be right back.

39
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:03,674
Indianapolis Center, you have any
traffic for Air East 31?

40
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,896
Air East 31, negative.

41
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:08,971
The only traffic I have
is a TWA L-1011...

42
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,110
in your 6 o'clock position...

43
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,420
...range 15 miles...

44
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:17,741
...and an Allegheny DC-9 in
your 12 o'clock position, 50 miles.

45
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:21,441
Stand by. I'll take a look at
broadband, over.

46
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:25,291
Air East 31 has traffic 2 o'clock,
slightly above and descending.

47
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,876
Air East 31, roger.

48
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:30,129
I have a primary target
about that position now.

49
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:32,229
I have no known traffic.

50
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,711
Stand by, I'll check low, over.

51
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,386
Check and see if
they know who it is.

52
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,971
Center, Air East 31.

53
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:41,223
The traffic's not lower than us.

54
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:45,243
He's 1 o'clock now,
still above me and descending.

55
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:48,576
Air East 31,
can you say aircraft type?

56
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:52,835
Negative, Center, no
distinct outline.

57
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:57,114
To tell you the truth,
the target is rather brilliant.

58
00:08:57,214 --> 00:09:01,285
It has the brightest anti-collision
lights I think I've ever seen.

59
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,512
Alternating white to red.

60
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:05,706
The colours are striking.

61
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:09,059
Center, this is TWA 517.

62
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,630
Traffic now looks lik e
extra-bright landing lights.

63
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,250
I thought Air East
had his landing lights on.

64
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:18,761
It could be a satellite.

65
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,805
I have a primary target now
in your 10 o'clock position...

66
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:23,057
...five miles, over.

67
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:25,434
Never seen anything like that.
- Affirmative, 31.

68
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,779
The traffic is
proceeding northeast.

69
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,104
No altitude readout.

70
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:32,274
Roger, Center. It doesn't appear
he'll be a problem.

71
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:35,819
He's going to descend
about 1500 feet below me.

72
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,655
Wait a second.

73
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,755
Stand by one.

74
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,660
Okay, Center, Air East 31.
The traffic has turned.

75
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,320
He's heading for my windshield.
We're turning immediately.

76
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:50,376
Air East 31, descend
and maintain flight level 310.

77
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:52,461
Break Allegheny,
turn right 30 degrees.

78
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,992
Get on the horn to
the 45th Recon Wing...

79
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:57,341
and see what they're
testing up there.

80
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:01,521
Do you have test operations
in restricted area 2508?

81
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:03,222
Air East 31, roger.

82
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:07,518
The traffic is luminous and
exhibiting non-ballistic motion.

83
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:10,437
Roger. Continue descent
at your discretion.

84
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:13,732
Okay, Center. Descent
at pilot's discretion is approved.

85
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:16,902
The traffic is approaching head-on,
ultra-bright and really moving.

86
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:20,823
And right by us. Right now.
Now, that was really close.

87
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:23,759
Air East 31 is out of 340...

88
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:26,620
Ask if they want to report officially.

89
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,165
TWA 517, do you want
to report a UFO?

90
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:31,265
Over.

91
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,507
TWA 517, do you want
to report a UFO?

92
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:39,607
Over.

93
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,654
Negative. We don't want to report.

94
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:44,862
Air East 31,

95
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:47,682
do you wish to
report a UFO? Over.

96
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,979
Negative. We don't want
to report one either.

97
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,483
Air East 31, do you wish to
file a report of any kind? Over.

98
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,695
I wouldn't know what kind
of report to file, Center.

99
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:01,797
Air East 31, me neither.

100
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:05,686
I'll try to track traffic
to destination, over.

101
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:36,217
What are you doing?
- I'm just...

102
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:42,414
What?

103
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:53,592
Barry?

104
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:06,021
Honey?

105
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:17,574
Honey?

106
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:23,038
Barry.

107
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,794
Barry.

108
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:29,461
Barry.

109
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,688
Dad, do my problems for me.

110
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:49,342
I don't have to do
your problems for...

111
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,385
you. You do your
problems for you.

112
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:55,472
That's why I graduated,
so I don't have to do problems.

113
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:58,267
I don't understand these fractions.

114
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,620
All right. What's one-third of 60?

115
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:04,523
That's a fraction.
I don't understand them.

116
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,233
All right, look.

117
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,333
Let's say...

118
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:12,464
...that this boxcar is 60 feet long.

119
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:16,493
And one-third is across
this switch here.

120
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:19,847
All right? Okay?

121
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:24,018
And now another train is coming.

122
00:15:26,145 --> 00:15:29,256
How far do you have to move
this boxcar off the track...

123
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,967
...so that the other train
doesn't smash it?

124
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:35,471
Quickly, Brad, there are thousands
of lives at stake.

125
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:37,571
Brad, any answer.

126
00:15:39,783 --> 00:15:41,869
Remember last weekend...

127
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:46,008
...you promised everybody a movie
this weekend?

128
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,916
Honey?

129
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:54,741
And you also
promised Goofy Golf.

130
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:56,841
Oh, yeah.

131
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:04,308
Roy, what is all this stuff
on my table?

132
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:07,294
I thought I told you
this was for my stuff.

133
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:09,463
I mean, you can have that table.

134
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:11,257
I don't want this on my table.

135
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:13,484
This can cause tetanus.

136
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:16,470
What is this?.
- You know what's playing?

137
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,570
Pinocchio.

138
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,515
The kids have never
seen Pinocchio.

139
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:22,351
You guys have never seen it.
You'll love it.

140
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:23,811
I don't believe this.

141
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,648
Who wants to go see...

142
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:28,548
some dumb cartoon
rated G for kids?

143
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,791
How old are you?
- Eight.

144
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,736
You wanna be 9?
- Yeah.

145
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:36,516
Then you're gonna see Pinocchio
tomorrow night.

146
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,993
That's a wonderful way
to win over your children.

147
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:43,205
I'm not serious. I'm just saying
that I grew up with Pinocchio.

148
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:47,385
And if kids are still kids,
they're gonna eat it up.

149
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,794
Okay.

150
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:51,422
Okay, I'm wrong.
I'm Wrong Roy, all right?

151
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:55,359
Toby. You are close to death.
Come out here.

152
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,774
Okay, now, I'll give
you your choice.

153
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:05,269
I'm not gonna be
biased in any way.

154
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,542
You can either play
Goofy Golf, which...

155
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:09,648
means a lot of
waiting and pushing...

156
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:12,148
...or you can see Pinocchio...

157
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:14,678
...which is a lot of
furry animals and...

158
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:16,655
magic and a
wonderful time. Okay?

159
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:18,616
Now, let's vote.
- Golf.

160
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:20,492
All right, everybody to bed.

161
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,213
No way. Dad said we could finish...

162
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:25,546
watching The Ten
Commandments.

163
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:28,446
Roy, that movie is four hours long.

164
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:29,145
I told them...

165
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,045
they'd watch only
five commandments.

166
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:32,755
Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.
- Hi, Earl.

167
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:36,175
We got a big problem.
I need your old man in the field.

168
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:38,385
Roy can't drive at
night without me.

169
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:40,804
We're experiencing
an overall outage.

170
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:44,104
Wait, wait, wait, I
can't... Hey, honey.

171
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:48,078
Jiminy Cricket.
It's Earl on the phone.

172
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:52,650
Just a second.

173
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,859
Hello.
- Neary.

174
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:57,488
Get into your truck
and report to line N in Tolono.

175
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,836
We're losing power
across the grid.

176
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,659
Has the outage hit you yet?

177
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,263
Neary? Neary? Neary?

178
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:16,104
Hey. Lights.

179
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:43,717
Barry.

180
00:18:51,058 --> 00:18:53,394
Barry.

181
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:08,158
Help. I'm lost.

182
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:14,023
You're gonna cough up a little
Tolono, right?

183
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:17,401
Cough up a Tolono
or an interstate, a Highway 90.

184
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:20,279
A little familiar landmark
of some sort.

185
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,449
Cornbread Road, south of 20.
- Cornbread?

186
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,326
Power must have been restored.

187
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:28,746
Couple hundred neighbours think
it's Saturday night.

188
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:30,080
Dispatch, this is 411.

189
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,700
Do you want me to disregard
that Tolono call?

190
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:39,006
You're in the middle of the road,
jackass.

191
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:41,366
Can you tell me
where Cornbread is?

192
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,466
Turkey.

193
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:13,557
A-34... A-34... F-27.

194
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,978
M-Mary-10 through
M-Mary-12. Okay.

195
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:21,065
Ten-47.

196
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:25,970
All right.

197
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,030
Stoppage in the single circuits
will lead you right to nowhere.

198
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,701
M-Mary-10.

199
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,196
Unit 211, 10-30, five, sev...

200
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:42,644
Oh, shit.

201
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:37,286
Unit 211, I'm back up on the street.
What do you guys got out there?

202
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:39,386
I don't believe this.

203
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,570
My God. It's bigger than a house.

204
00:23:44,018 --> 00:23:46,178
This thing is lik e a barn.

205
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:49,315
This is absolutely crazy.

206
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,594
What is your location?

207
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:58,654
Just off the Telemark Expressway
and east toward Harper Valley.

208
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:06,056
Barry.

209
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:08,377
No.

210
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:10,477
Watch out.

211
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,903
Oh, my God. Lady. Lady.

212
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:20,112
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

213
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:23,893
I didn't see him.
He was in the middle of the road.

214
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:25,995
Hello?
- Oh, my God.

215
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:29,540
Hello. Here.
- What's the matter with you?

216
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:34,545
Barry, come back here.
Come on, now.

217
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:06,658
Ice cream.

218
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,221
This is nuts.

219
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:31,224
No.

220
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,266
Wait a minute.

221
00:27:13,686 --> 00:27:16,105
What are you guys doing? Hey.

222
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:19,024
That's Ohio. That's a quarter.

223
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:28,346
Jesus, look at those suckers.
They're glued to the road.

224
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:17,414
Honey, wake up.

225
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Ronnie, wake up.

226
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,278
You're not gonna
believe what I saw.

227
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,113
Don't. Not now.

228
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:26,075
No, listen.
I never would have believed it.

229
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:28,869
There was this...
In the cab there was this whole...

230
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:32,969
It went... It was...
There was a red whoosh that...

231
00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:34,917
Roy.

232
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,877
Ike called you.

233
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:38,796
And McGovern.

234
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:41,799
They want you to call.
They couldn't reach you.

235
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:43,342
I turned the radio off.

236
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,719
Don't do that.
The phone rang off the hook.

237
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:48,050
It woke Sylvia up
two times already.

238
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,557
You'd better call them.

239
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:51,363
You know those
pictures in National

240
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,018
Geographic, the aurora borealis?

241
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:54,754
This is better than
that. This is really...

242
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:55,854
Come on.

243
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:58,023
Come on, Ronnie,
get up. Come on.

244
00:28:58,123 --> 00:29:00,401
What's wrong?
- Nothing. I don't know.

245
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:02,862
Get up. I'm not kidding.
- Is it an accident?

246
00:29:02,962 --> 00:29:06,115
It's not an accident. You wanted
to get out of the house, right?

247
00:29:06,215 --> 00:29:07,950
Not at 4:00 in the morning.

248
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,553
Ronnie, I need you
to see something with me.

249
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:13,762
It's really important.

250
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:16,458
Okay. All right.
What about the kids?

251
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:18,502
What? Oh, the kids.
I'll get the kids.

252
00:29:18,602 --> 00:29:20,880
Sylvia, we're going
on an adventure.

253
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,607
Toby. Brad. Come on. Get up.

254
00:29:23,816 --> 00:29:26,056
It's better than Goofy Golf.

255
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:32,116
I'm going as fast as I can.

256
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:35,158
Come on.

257
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:39,415
All right, all right.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Harris.

258
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:41,400
Roy, there's Mrs. Harris.

259
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,108
There better be a good
reason for this...

260
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:46,363
because it doesn't
make any sense.

261
00:29:46,463 --> 00:29:50,492
All right, Roy, I really think
you've proved your point.

262
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:53,595
Roy. Roy.

263
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:56,562
Roy, you're sunburned.
Look at you.

264
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,104
Honey, what is that?

265
00:30:08,944 --> 00:30:11,104
Roy, what did it look like?

266
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:14,389
It was like an ice-cream cone.

267
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,645
What flavour?

268
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:19,745
Orange.

269
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:22,691
It was orange.
It wasn't like an ice-cream cone.

270
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,152
It was more like a shell.
You know, like this:

271
00:30:25,252 --> 00:30:26,779
Like a taco?

272
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:31,508
Was it like one of those Sara Lee
moon-shaped cookies?

273
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,303
Those crescent cookies?

274
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:46,376
Don't you think I'm taking this
really well?

275
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:52,116
I remember coming to
places like this...

276
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:54,376
just to look at each other.

277
00:30:57,618 --> 00:30:59,618
Snuggle.

278
00:33:24,974 --> 00:33:28,727
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

279
00:33:29,478 --> 00:33:31,005
I don't believe it.

280
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:32,256
It's the Cotopaxi.

281
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:35,716
Why is it here?
- Beats the shit out of me.

282
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:12,104
Is this the bathroom?

283
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:32,139
Hey, this is not your
toy to play with...

284
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,526
every time I turn around.

285
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:35,528
He looks like a 50l50 Bar.

286
00:34:35,628 --> 00:34:39,406
All right, out of this house.
All of you. Out of my house.

287
00:34:39,506 --> 00:34:41,951
I'm sorry, but you're
not to play with this.

288
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:44,851
Get out while I
clean up your mess.

289
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:47,012
Thank you very much.

290
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,726
Roy, I found
this overnight-tanning stuff.

291
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:11,897
I want you to spray it on half
your face, so it's all one colour.

292
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:15,776
It makes my face look yellow.
What does this remind you of?

293
00:35:15,876 --> 00:35:18,237
Then we'll tell everybody
you fell asleep...

294
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:20,406
...under the sun lamp
on your right side.

295
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:22,506
What for?

296
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:25,870
Dad, can I ask you a question?
- What?

297
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,580
Are they for real?

298
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,916
That's what for.
No, they are not for real.

299
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:33,460
Go outside and have
a hot dog, okay?

300
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,546
Ronnie, don't tell him that.

301
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:37,499
Roy, look, don't talk
about this until...

302
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,174
you know what you're
talking about.

303
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:43,429
If I can't talk about it,
how will I know what's going on?

304
00:35:43,529 --> 00:35:46,407
What?
- Mom, I believe in them.

305
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:49,994
I believe in them too.
- Oh, no, you don't.

306
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:52,021
Dad says we do.

307
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:54,121
No, he does not.

308
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:57,042
Do you, Roy?
- Ronnie.

309
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:00,713
All I wanna do is know
what's going on.

310
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:04,241
Nothing's going on.
It's just one of those things.

311
00:36:04,341 --> 00:36:06,501
Which things? Which things?

312
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:09,622
I don't wanna hear about this.
- This is very important.

313
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:12,666
I won't let it lay here.
I'm gonna call somebody.

314
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:15,044
I'm not listening. I'm not listening.

315
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:18,904
I saw something last night
that I can't explain.

316
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:23,175
I saw something last night
I can't explain.

317
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:27,206
I'm going out there again tonight.

318
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:32,244
No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

319
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:35,539
No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

320
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:39,527
No, you're not.

321
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:41,111
Do they live on the moon?

322
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:43,374
They got bases there so at night...

323
00:36:43,474 --> 00:36:45,574
they can come
through your window.

324
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:48,761
This isn't a moonburn, goddamn it.

325
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:51,997
You came through my window.
- You hurt me.

326
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:54,875
You took all my covers.
- Roy's not like that.

327
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:57,695
He loves his work. Don't say that.

328
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,339
What did he do?
He was with us all night.

329
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,091
I won't have to go tonight.

330
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:04,902
He is not like that at all.

331
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:07,488
Stop yelling at me.

332
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:10,057
Can't you tell him about this?

333
00:37:10,157 --> 00:37:11,767
Hello?

334
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:13,644
I can't believe it.

335
00:37:13,744 --> 00:37:15,271
Roy...

336
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:17,371
...you got fired.

337
00:37:17,998 --> 00:37:20,798
They didn't even wanna talk to you.

338
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:37,295
Where were the
sounds coming from?

339
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:05,693
Where did these
sounds come from?

340
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,793
Tell us, please.

341
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:36,434
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

342
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:44,478
I beg your pardon,
but my English is not good too.

343
00:39:47,272 --> 00:39:49,049
I want to share with you now...

344
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:52,509
...the breakthrough
that happened in India.

345
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,864
We think it means something.

346
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:59,827
We think it is important.

347
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:03,502
To help you learn, I
am using the hand...

348
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,002
sign created by Zoltn Kodly.

349
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,755
Kodly developed these signs
to teach music to deaf children.

350
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:38,924
Hello?

351
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:40,369
Hi.

352
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:42,955
Hi, how are you?
You came here too?

353
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:44,707
Yes. Jillian Guiler.

354
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:47,209
Roy Neary.
Sorry about what happened.

355
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:50,312
Good night.
- What?

356
00:41:52,022 --> 00:41:54,233
Look at you.

357
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:59,363
You got the same burn.

358
00:41:59,613 --> 00:42:03,642
Yeah, but it's better on you.
You got it all over at least.

359
00:42:03,742 --> 00:42:06,542
I gotta tan the other side tonight.

360
00:42:06,787 --> 00:42:08,981
How's the kid? I'm really sorry.

361
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:10,691
I'll be right back.

362
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:13,903
Raise your head a bit
and give me a smile. Come on.

363
00:42:14,003 --> 00:42:17,923
He's a little young for a record,
don't you think?

364
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:39,067
Weird.

365
00:42:40,154 --> 00:42:45,274
I know this sounds crazy, but
ever since yesterday on the road...

366
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:47,972
...l've been seeing this shape.

367
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:52,791
In shaving cream and pillows...

368
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:09,266
Damn it, I know this.
I know what this is.

369
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:16,772
This means something.

370
00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:24,988
This is important.

371
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:28,577
Here they come.
- Get the camera.

372
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:32,164
Out of the northwest.
- Jimmy, come here.

373
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:48,931
It's like Halloween for grownups.

374
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:52,641
Trick or treat.

375
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:25,173
Wait a minute.

376
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:18,754
Here are the patterns.

377
00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:21,191
We received two
15-minute broadcasts.

378
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:22,466
Non-random signals?

379
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:25,091
104 rapid pulses.
After a five-second...

380
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:26,428
interval, 40 pulses.

381
00:45:26,528 --> 00:45:29,728
Another five-second break,
and 30 pulses.

382
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:33,315
Silence, then a
new set of numbers.

383
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:36,021
40, break five. 36, break five. Ten.

384
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:38,290
104 rapid pulses.
- Lord.

385
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,620
Wait 60 seconds and the
whole doggone thing repeats.

386
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:45,739
Where are the signals from?
- The neighbourhood.

387
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,950
Light-travel time,
roughly 7 seconds.

388
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,327
Well within the plane
of the ecliptic.

389
00:45:50,427 --> 00:45:52,947
Are these non-random
signals here,

390
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:55,416
40, 36, 10, in response to that?

391
00:45:55,516 --> 00:45:58,961
No. They should be. We've sent
this combination out for weeks.

392
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:02,101
But all we're getting back
are numbers.

393
00:46:06,652 --> 00:46:10,598
This could mean the India sounds
reached a dead end.

394
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:12,099
They don't mean a thing.

395
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:14,351
There's so much we don't know.

396
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:17,491
How about where the
signals originate?

397
00:46:20,082 --> 00:46:22,082
Excuse me.

398
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:25,754
What letter is 104?

399
00:46:28,173 --> 00:46:30,173
Excuse me.

400
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,806
Before I got paid to speak French...

401
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:40,934
...I used to read maps.

402
00:46:42,688 --> 00:46:45,328
This first number is a longitude.

403
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:52,072
I've got two sets of three numbers.

404
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:55,242
Degrees, minutes and seconds.

405
00:46:55,451 --> 00:47:00,571
The first number has three digits,
and the last two are below 60.

406
00:47:00,623 --> 00:47:05,110
It's not in the right ascension
and declination on the sky.

407
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,696
These have to be
Earth coordinates.

408
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:10,196
There's a globe in the office.

409
00:47:13,302 --> 00:47:14,745
This is what we need.

410
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:17,665
Maybe there's a release pin
underneath here.

411
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:20,125
That's a $2500 globe.
What are you doing?

412
00:47:20,225 --> 00:47:24,385
It's heavy, watch your feet.
- Let me hit the mother.

413
00:47:38,285 --> 00:47:42,525
All right, everybody, quiet down.
Hold it down. Quiet.

414
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:46,777
That's not right.

415
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:49,213
The antenna. How dumb.

416
00:47:49,421 --> 00:47:51,282
Which way's it pointing?
- Northeast.

417
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:53,382
That's Wyoming.

418
00:47:59,723 --> 00:48:02,334
We'll need a geodetic survey map
of Wyoming.

419
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:04,420
I want it to the square yard.

420
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,673
The Army has a geodetic
survey map of Wyoming.

421
00:48:07,773 --> 00:48:09,858
We not only need...

422
00:49:59,426 --> 00:50:01,426
Toys.

423
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:04,179
Toys.

424
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,300
Oh, my God.

425
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,916
You can come and play now.

426
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,246
You can come and play now.

427
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:03,926
Come in through the door.

428
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:09,139
One, two, three...

429
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:19,383
Oh, honey.

430
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:21,610
Mom, look. The sun's here.

431
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:26,824
Oh, honey.

432
00:52:27,491 --> 00:52:29,491
Oh, my God.

433
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:09,364
Go away.

434
00:53:33,182 --> 00:53:35,182
Clean everything up.

435
00:53:50,866 --> 00:53:54,146
Mom, let me listen.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

436
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:12,636
Mom, look.
- Oh, my God.

437
00:54:20,854 --> 00:54:23,273
Come in through the door.

438
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:49,341
Barry. Barry.

439
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,310
Jillian. Jillian.

440
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:05,090
May we have a statement?

441
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,219
The report you gave to the police
was spectacular.

442
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,639
We need it for the 6:00 news.

443
00:55:13,073 --> 00:55:14,433
They got him.

444
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:15,684
What?

445
00:55:15,784 --> 00:55:18,521
Is it true you're leaving
to look for your son?

446
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:23,421
Has there been a ransom note?
- Where will you start looking?

447
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,501
His name is Barry.

448
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:30,252
Where is your husband now,
Mrs. Guiler?

449
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,639
Are you involved in any
kind of parapsychologies?

450
00:55:35,346 --> 00:55:37,986
Turn around, please. Turn around.

451
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,160
You gave the police a report.
Would you mind repeating it?

452
00:55:46,857 --> 00:55:49,985
Folks, you can go
in now. Room 3655.

453
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:53,889
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a flying saucer.

454
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,989
That's the one I saw.

455
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:01,795
I swear that's the same one.
It's the one I saw.

456
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:05,317
It's made of pewter,
made in Japan...

457
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:09,497
...and thrown across the lawn
by one of my children.

458
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:14,660
I wanted to point out that we're
not all 'polished brass' about this.

459
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,680
And also point out that last year...

460
00:56:17,888 --> 00:56:21,000
...Americans shot more than seven
billion photographs...

461
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,572
...at a record of $6.6 billion...

462
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,217
for film equipment
and processing.

463
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:28,299
Now, with all those
shutters clicking...

464
00:56:28,399 --> 00:56:31,302
...where is the indisputable
photographic evidence?

465
00:56:31,402 --> 00:56:34,930
I've been in the news
business for a long time.

466
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:39,059
We never took a picture
of a plane crash as it happened...

467
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,639
...or an automobile accident
and get it on the 6:00 news.

468
00:56:50,879 --> 00:56:54,533
There are lots of ideas
that would be fun to believe in.

469
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:56,452
Mental telepathy...

470
00:56:56,552 --> 00:56:58,329
...time travel...

471
00:56:58,429 --> 00:57:00,429
...immortality...

472
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:02,723
...even Santa Claus.

473
00:57:03,225 --> 00:57:07,504
I know it's no fun to go home and
say, 'Guess what happened today?

474
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:11,467
I was in the shopping centre,
and there was this bright light...

475
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:13,777
...and I rushed outside...

476
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:16,226
...and it was an aeroplane.'

477
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,560
Excuse me, sir.
I didn't want to see this.

478
00:57:20,534 --> 00:57:21,977
I sure wish I had.

479
00:57:22,077 --> 00:57:24,146
For 15 years I've been looking...

480
00:57:24,246 --> 00:57:27,650
...for these damn silly lights
in the night sky.

481
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,276
I've never found any.

482
00:57:29,376 --> 00:57:32,613
I'd like to, because
I believe in life elsewhere.

483
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:34,114
Why don't you admit...

484
00:57:34,214 --> 00:57:38,077
...that the Air Force is conducting
tests in the Foothills area?

485
00:57:38,177 --> 00:57:41,057
It would be easy to say yes to that.

486
00:57:41,555 --> 00:57:45,709
But I'm not going to mislead you.
This is not the case.

487
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:47,889
I don't know what you saw.

488
00:57:48,062 --> 00:57:50,548
You can't fool us by
agreeing with us.

489
00:57:50,648 --> 00:57:52,341
No, come on.

490
00:57:52,441 --> 00:57:54,441
I saw Bigfoot once.

491
00:57:59,198 --> 00:58:03,369
1951. Back in Sequoia
National Park.

492
00:58:03,577 --> 00:58:07,831
Had a foot on her, 37 inches.
Heel to toe.

493
00:58:11,752 --> 00:58:16,072
Made a sound I would not want
to hear twice in my life.

494
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:24,017
I believe I've encountered
that gentleman myself.

495
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:26,876
I was sitting on the porch,
looking through the screen.

496
00:58:26,976 --> 00:58:29,461
I seen this big white dot in the sky.

497
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:32,201
It turned red and blue and green.

498
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:39,087
UFOs do not represent a direct...

499
00:58:39,187 --> 00:58:42,147
physical threat to
national security.

500
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,780
We do not support them,
and we encourage you not to.

501
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:27,269
Let's get in touch with
the forest service...

502
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:31,357
...or we'll end up in a wilderness
area with vehicular traffic.

503
00:59:31,457 --> 00:59:36,497
And that's strictly sacred-cow stuff
for those folks in Wyoming.

504
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:44,315
If this mission fully develops...

505
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,322
...I get white knuckles
thinking about...

506
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:51,168
what might be ahead
for those folks.

507
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:53,212
Your flight will be at 2000 hours.

508
00:59:53,312 --> 00:59:57,392
We have a limo that'll take you
to the heliport now.

509
00:59:57,524 --> 01:00:00,348
And transportation
will be provided...

510
01:00:00,448 --> 01:00:02,448
on the other end.

511
01:00:03,572 --> 01:00:06,267
I like the flash-flood idea.
- Where do you get the water?

512
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,102
We've had about two
inches of rain...

513
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:10,839
We'll tell them one
of the reservoirs...

514
01:00:10,939 --> 01:00:11,897
is gonna burst.

515
01:00:11,997 --> 01:00:14,733
Besides, there's not enough water
in those reservoirs.

516
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:18,320
Wait. Contaminated water
affects people, crops, animals.

517
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,697
Disease.

518
01:00:19,797 --> 01:00:22,616
Yeah, epidemic.
- What kind of disease?

519
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:23,868
A plague epidemic.

520
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:26,288
Nobody will believe a plague.

521
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,880
Anthrax.
- Ranching country.

522
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:31,333
There are a lot of
sheep in the hills.

523
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:32,793
Good, I like that.

524
01:00:32,893 --> 01:00:34,063
It'll create a panic.

525
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,088
But it may not evacuate everybody.

526
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:40,028
There's always some joker
who thinks he's immune.

527
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:45,431
I need something so scary
it'll clear 300 square miles...

528
01:00:45,531 --> 01:00:48,409
...of every living Christian soul.

529
01:01:19,648 --> 01:01:21,648
Help yourself.

530
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:28,907
I hate these potatoes.
There's a dead fly in my potatoes.

531
01:01:29,116 --> 01:01:31,116
It's okay.

532
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:19,329
Well, I guess you've noticed...

533
01:03:19,601 --> 01:03:24,106
...something is a little strange
with Dad.

534
01:03:27,318 --> 01:03:29,318
It's okay, though.

535
01:03:31,363 --> 01:03:33,363
I'm still Dad.

536
01:03:38,078 --> 01:03:42,124
I can't describe it,
what I'm feeling...

537
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:44,710
...and what I'm thinking.

538
01:03:47,338 --> 01:03:49,548
This means something.

539
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:53,093
This is important.

540
01:04:04,229 --> 01:04:06,229
That's not right.

541
01:04:09,818 --> 01:04:11,818
It's not right.

542
01:04:13,447 --> 01:04:15,447
That's not right.

543
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,560
What is it?

544
01:04:46,897 --> 01:04:49,233
What is it?.

545
01:04:56,615 --> 01:04:58,615
It's not fair.

546
01:05:03,872 --> 01:05:05,872
Tell me.

547
01:05:30,149 --> 01:05:34,236
Roy? Roy.

548
01:05:35,154 --> 01:05:37,154
Open the door, please.

549
01:05:38,032 --> 01:05:42,244
Please. Roy. Roy.

550
01:05:42,411 --> 01:05:44,230
Open this door.

551
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:46,330
Open this door.

552
01:05:51,879 --> 01:05:53,879
All right.

553
01:06:14,693 --> 01:06:18,133
I don't think I know
what's happening to me.

554
01:06:23,619 --> 01:06:28,248
Look, Roy. What it is,
is family therapy.

555
01:06:28,457 --> 01:06:31,168
I mean, we all go. We all talk.

556
01:06:31,418 --> 01:06:35,489
No one is singled out.
Maybe it's not your fault anyway.

557
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:40,389
It's waterproof. It still works.
- Roy. Promise me you'll go.

558
01:06:40,844 --> 01:06:43,889
You crybaby. You crybaby.

559
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:46,125
You crybaby.
- Get out of here.

560
01:06:46,225 --> 01:06:47,501
Get out.

561
01:06:47,601 --> 01:06:50,020
Come on, you guys. Come on.

562
01:06:50,187 --> 01:06:52,187
You crybaby.

563
01:06:52,189 --> 01:06:53,883
Be quiet.
- Stop it.

564
01:06:53,983 --> 01:06:55,718
I don't understand it.

565
01:06:55,818 --> 01:06:58,279
Neither do I.
- Get out.

566
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:01,448
Go to your room
and close the door.

567
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:05,644
Ronnie?
- Yes.

568
01:07:05,744 --> 01:07:09,915
I'm really scared.
I want you to help me.

569
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,207
All this bullshit.

570
01:07:11,307 --> 01:07:13,319
It's turning this
house upside down.

571
01:07:13,419 --> 01:07:15,988
Ronnie, just...
- I just hate you. That's why.

572
01:07:16,088 --> 01:07:17,865
No.
- Ronnie. Ronnie.

573
01:07:17,965 --> 01:07:21,452
Hold me. Put your arms
around me. It'll really help me.

574
01:07:21,552 --> 01:07:22,828
It'll really help me.

575
01:07:22,928 --> 01:07:26,123
Listen. Listen.
Don't you see what's happening?

576
01:07:26,223 --> 01:07:28,334
None of our friends
call us anymore.

577
01:07:28,434 --> 01:07:30,753
You're out of work. You don't care.

578
01:07:30,853 --> 01:07:33,813
You're wrecking us.
You're ruining us.

579
01:07:33,939 --> 01:07:36,442
Ronnie, just hold on.
- No. No.

580
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,650
Hold on.
- No.

581
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,820
Ronnie.

582
01:07:42,323 --> 01:07:44,323
Ronnie?

583
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:48,537
Ronnie, open the door now.
Come on.

584
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:27,224
Well, what do you know?
It's disintegrated.

585
01:08:30,037 --> 01:08:33,957
Happy birthday, you thing from
another world, you.

586
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,458
Thank you.

587
01:08:43,092 --> 01:08:45,492
Well, I guess he's had enough.

588
01:08:47,513 --> 01:08:49,848
Are you going to yell at me?

589
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:08,450
Ronnie? Everything's fine.

590
01:09:18,669 --> 01:09:21,069
All this stuff is coming down.

591
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:28,470
It's all gonna be like it was.

592
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:41,734
That's the last straw.
Now I use my secret weapon.

593
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:12,831
Roy?

594
01:10:12,931 --> 01:10:16,644
Roy, I'm sorry about
last night. Roy.

595
01:10:19,688 --> 01:10:21,941
Roy, what are you doing?

596
01:10:22,942 --> 01:10:24,942
Jesus.

597
01:10:33,786 --> 01:10:35,866
The plants are fine there.

598
01:10:36,497 --> 01:10:38,274
Can you hear me?

599
01:10:38,374 --> 01:10:39,650
Wait.

600
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,752
Wait. What are you doing?

601
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:43,237
You're gonna love it.

602
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:45,865
What do you mean?
- You'll really love this.

603
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:48,676
Roy, what are you doing?

604
01:10:54,139 --> 01:10:56,139
Oh, Roy.

605
01:10:56,642 --> 01:10:58,642
My God.

606
01:10:59,353 --> 01:11:01,353
Come on, men.

607
01:11:02,314 --> 01:11:06,527
Dad, after this, can we
throw dirt in my window?

608
01:11:10,114 --> 01:11:12,114
Stop it.

609
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,560
Stop. Stop it.

610
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,660
Honey.

611
01:11:16,704 --> 01:11:21,104
If I don't do this, that's when
I'm gonna need a doctor.

612
01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:25,863
What are you doing?

613
01:11:25,963 --> 01:11:27,740
I got it.
- What are you doing?

614
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,452
I figured it out, that's all.
Will you just listen?

615
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:34,093
You ever look at
something crazy, and...

616
01:11:34,193 --> 01:11:36,540
then see it another
way and it's not?

617
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,791
No, I haven't.

618
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:40,044
Come on, Ronnie. Just listen.

619
01:11:40,144 --> 01:11:42,588
I don't know what you're doing.
- Close your eyes.

620
01:11:42,688 --> 01:11:45,032
Close your eyes and
hold your breath,

621
01:11:45,132 --> 01:11:47,218
everything will be really pretty.

622
01:11:47,318 --> 01:11:48,469
You're scaring us now.

623
01:11:48,569 --> 01:11:51,805
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
I feel really good.

624
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:53,766
Everything's gonna be all right.

625
01:11:53,866 --> 01:11:56,143
I haven't felt this good in years.

626
01:11:56,243 --> 01:11:59,523
Everything's gonna be okay.
I can feel it.

627
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:05,630
Now what else? What else?
- Like this? Like this?

628
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:07,919
Right.

629
01:12:46,168 --> 01:12:48,168
Like this?

630
01:12:50,339 --> 01:12:52,339
Chicken wire.

631
01:13:02,184 --> 01:13:04,336
Whatever you're doing,
it's against the law.

632
01:13:04,436 --> 01:13:06,213
He's putting it back, Mrs. Harris.

633
01:13:06,313 --> 01:13:07,464
I'll pay you for this.

634
01:13:07,564 --> 01:13:08,716
Take it. Take it.

635
01:13:08,816 --> 01:13:10,816
I'm perfectly fine.

636
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:13,053
Let go of this fence.
Come with me.

637
01:13:13,153 --> 01:13:16,140
Do you want me to hit you?
Let go of that fence.

638
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,726
Toby. Listen to me. Listen to me.

639
01:13:18,826 --> 01:13:20,686
Come on, right now.
We're going.

640
01:13:20,786 --> 01:13:24,866
I want to stay here.
- Let go of the fence. Come on.

641
01:13:42,182 --> 01:13:44,351
Stay. Stay.

642
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:50,874
Where we going?
- Where we going?

643
01:13:50,941 --> 01:13:52,718
Where are we going?
- Get in the car.

644
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:56,096
Where are we going?
- Quietly, quickly, get in.

645
01:13:56,196 --> 01:13:57,765
Get in there, Toby.

646
01:13:57,865 --> 01:13:59,865
Quickly.

647
01:14:02,036 --> 01:14:04,605
Dad needs some more help.
- Lock the doors.

648
01:14:04,705 --> 01:14:06,148
Dad needs some more help.

649
01:14:06,248 --> 01:14:09,860
Quiet. Just lock the doors.
Roll up those windows.

650
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,463
Dad needs some more help.

651
01:14:12,713 --> 01:14:14,406
Honey, where you going?

652
01:14:14,506 --> 01:14:16,666
What?
- Where are you going?

653
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:19,739
Taking the kids to my sister's.

654
01:14:21,096 --> 01:14:24,056
That's crazy.
You're not even dressed.

655
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:25,793
What?

656
01:14:25,893 --> 01:14:27,893
You said what?

657
01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:34,093
Ronnie, wait.

658
01:14:34,193 --> 01:14:36,195
Ronnie, hold it.

659
01:14:37,696 --> 01:14:40,016
Would you hold it one minute?

660
01:15:06,392 --> 01:15:08,392
Morning.

661
01:15:46,974 --> 01:15:50,144
What is wrong with me today?

662
01:15:56,233 --> 01:15:57,760
Who is it, please?

663
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:00,690
It's the mailman.
There's a package...

664
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,790
for Julie Anderson.

665
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,245
You can just leave it at the door.

666
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:14,251
I can't do that.
I'm supposed to C. O.D. Lik e that.

667
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,460
And besides...

668
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:20,034
...you and I have to have
a little talk...

669
01:16:20,215 --> 01:16:22,215
...about Kim.

670
01:16:41,362 --> 01:16:44,242
Lik e sands through
the hourglass...

671
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:47,451
...so are the Days of Our Lives.

672
01:17:13,185 --> 01:17:15,514
Good evening. At the
top of the news...

673
01:17:15,614 --> 01:17:17,089
tonight, a rail disaster.

674
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:19,175
At Devil's Tower, Wyoming...

675
01:17:19,275 --> 01:17:22,845
...a trainload of dangerous
chemical gas went off the rails...

676
01:17:22,945 --> 01:17:25,681
...and forced the widest
area evacuation...

677
01:17:25,781 --> 01:17:29,143
...in the history of these
controversial Army rail shipments.

678
01:17:29,243 --> 01:17:32,579
Whenever you want me to.
Tomorrow is fine.

679
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,667
I can do other things.

680
01:17:37,376 --> 01:17:39,628
I'm trying to be.

681
01:17:40,963 --> 01:17:42,114
Yes, I am.

682
01:17:42,214 --> 01:17:45,492
The Army and National Guard are
supervising the evacuation.

683
01:17:45,592 --> 01:17:50,055
I am an adult, okay?
Even though there's no such thing.

684
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:51,999
It was a joke.

685
01:17:52,099 --> 01:17:55,219
The danger will be over
within 72 hours.

686
01:17:55,519 --> 01:17:58,314
Ronnie, anything you want.

687
01:17:58,647 --> 01:18:01,275
Anything you want, I'll do.

688
01:18:04,236 --> 01:18:06,236
For how long?

689
01:18:11,744 --> 01:18:13,744
All of you?

690
01:18:14,705 --> 01:18:19,251
No. Ronnie, I wanna talk
about this in person.

691
01:18:20,336 --> 01:18:24,816
This is not... We can't talk
about this on the telephone.

692
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:27,993
Ronnie. Don't hang up.
Just don't...

693
01:18:28,093 --> 01:18:30,748
meat should remain unaffected.

694
01:18:30,848 --> 01:18:34,224
This means order your
steak well-done.

695
01:18:34,391 --> 01:18:37,670
Devil's Tower, Wyoming was
the first national monument...

696
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:41,674
...erected in this country by
Theodore Roosevelt in 1915.

697
01:18:41,774 --> 01:18:45,386
Thousands of civilian refugees
are fleeing the area...

698
01:18:45,486 --> 01:18:49,056
...spurred by rumours that the
overturned tank er cars...

699
01:18:49,156 --> 01:18:51,548
...at Walkashi Needles
Junction were...

700
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:53,727
filled to capacity with nerve gas.

701
01:18:53,827 --> 01:18:55,604
In a few minutes,
we're going to be...

702
01:18:55,704 --> 01:18:59,249
boasts 400, 000 vacationers.

703
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:02,236
Fortunately, during this mishap
there have been no fatalities.

704
01:19:02,336 --> 01:19:04,896
Evacuate this area,
which soon...

705
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:08,951
...will become the 'hot zone,'
depending on the prevailing winds.

706
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:12,955
This is as close to the disaster
as we've been allowed to get.

707
01:19:13,055 --> 01:19:15,833
Due to a strong prevailing
north-south wind.

708
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:18,836
Army engineers and the
Wyoming National Guard...

709
01:19:18,936 --> 01:19:22,590
...are making every effort to
contain the leaking toxins...

710
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:25,926
...and evacuate an area of almost
200 square miles.

711
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:29,555
Everyone is being warned:
Stay out of the area.

712
01:19:29,655 --> 01:19:32,695
Everyone, please,
stay out of the area.

713
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,019
And thousands of others
are homeless.

714
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:39,690
U.S. Army Materiel Command has
issued these new area restrictions:

715
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:41,471
All roadways north
of Crowheart on

716
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:42,234
Interstate 25.

717
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:43,444
Shit.

718
01:19:43,544 --> 01:19:46,864
All roads leading into the
Grand Tetons west of Meteste.

719
01:19:46,964 --> 01:19:49,992
All multilane undivided
full-traffic interchange...

720
01:19:50,092 --> 01:19:54,652
...railroad, local and historic
stage roads south of Cody.

721
01:20:04,356 --> 01:20:08,596
Why aren't there fat lines
instead of these thin ones?

722
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:10,819
Yo.

723
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,350
Holy mother of...
- You're going the wrong way.

724
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:18,996
Yo. Turn back around.
Back this way.

725
01:20:19,622 --> 01:20:21,357
What's the matter with you?

726
01:20:21,457 --> 01:20:23,150
Yes, sir. Sorry, officer.

727
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:26,610
It's just a rental, officer.
Just a rental.

728
01:20:26,879 --> 01:20:28,364
My fault. My fault.

729
01:20:28,464 --> 01:20:30,908
Starting with the letter 'F,'
as in 'Frank'...

730
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:33,285
...to the letter 'J' as in 'Jack'...

731
01:20:33,385 --> 01:20:36,480
...please find your
way to the loading...

732
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:39,140
platform for immediate boarding.

733
01:20:41,393 --> 01:20:43,838
You'll be real disappointed
and sorry...

734
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:46,348
...if you don't have
an early-warning...

735
01:20:46,448 --> 01:20:48,551
system, such as a
bird, a gas mask.

736
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:50,886
Why, even my dog has a gas mask.

737
01:20:50,986 --> 01:20:54,666
And any of you folks are
worth more than a dog.

738
01:20:56,408 --> 01:21:00,037
Roy? Roy.

739
01:21:01,664 --> 01:21:03,666
Roy.

740
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:18,845
Roy?

741
01:21:21,225 --> 01:21:23,225
Roy?

742
01:21:25,354 --> 01:21:27,354
Roy.

743
01:21:28,107 --> 01:21:30,107
Roy.

744
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:34,611
Roy.

745
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:42,771
I don't care where you go,
just get behind the barricade.

746
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:45,082
There's no way out.

747
01:22:08,564 --> 01:22:09,715
What are we doing?

748
01:22:09,815 --> 01:22:11,714
Only way to get back
is cross-country.

749
01:22:11,814 --> 01:22:13,302
We'll break through the fence.

750
01:22:13,402 --> 01:22:16,522
Let's go.
- All right, hold on. Hold on.

751
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:41,789
The police dragged
the river for him.

752
01:22:41,889 --> 01:22:44,959
I told them he wasn't in the river.
He wasn't.

753
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:48,097
Then they went around
to every house...

754
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:50,197
within five miles...

755
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:54,818
...looking inside
back-yard refrigerators.

756
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:01,778
They asked if I'd
seen any strangers...

757
01:23:01,878 --> 01:23:03,878
in the neighbourhood.

758
01:24:10,394 --> 01:24:12,605
I don't believe it's real.

759
01:24:14,732 --> 01:24:16,812
I don't believe it's real.

760
01:24:18,027 --> 01:24:20,027
It's real.

761
01:24:26,076 --> 01:24:28,836
Let's get down there.
Get some gas...

762
01:24:28,936 --> 01:24:30,936
and get down in there.

763
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:34,541
What are those?

764
01:24:58,025 --> 01:25:02,196
Look, I guarantee you.
This whole thing is a put-on.

765
01:25:49,118 --> 01:25:51,998
What do you want?
Get your hands off.

766
01:25:53,706 --> 01:25:56,426
How are you feeling?
- I feel fine.

767
01:25:56,834 --> 01:26:00,008
According to my birds,
the only bad air...

768
01:26:00,108 --> 01:26:02,668
is from you guys farting around.

769
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:13,334
Move them out.
- What's happening?

770
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,794
What? Where are we going?
- Go to the van.

771
01:26:15,894 --> 01:26:17,379
Where are you taking her?

772
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:19,632
Hold it. Why can't we go together?

773
01:26:19,732 --> 01:26:21,175
Watch your step.

774
01:26:21,275 --> 01:26:23,275
Roy.

775
01:26:39,084 --> 01:26:42,154
We have very little time, Mr. Neary.
This is Mr. Lacombe.

776
01:26:42,254 --> 01:26:44,573
Hello.
- We need answers from you...

777
01:26:44,673 --> 01:26:46,909
...that are honest, direct
and to the point.

778
01:26:47,009 --> 01:26:49,009
Where is Jillian?

779
01:26:50,429 --> 01:26:54,500
Do you realise the danger you
and your friend have risked?

780
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,003
In coming here, you've
exposed yourself to toxic gas.

781
01:26:58,103 --> 01:26:59,797
Well, I'm alive.

782
01:26:59,897 --> 01:27:01,897
We're talking.

783
01:27:02,274 --> 01:27:04,318
This is true, Mr. Neary.

784
01:27:05,235 --> 01:27:09,875
But if the wind blew from
the south instead of the north...

785
01:27:10,032 --> 01:27:12,351
...this conversation would not be
taking place.

786
01:27:12,451 --> 01:27:15,251
There's nothing wrong with the air.

787
01:27:15,829 --> 01:27:17,565
What makes you say that?

788
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,359
I just know.
There's nothing wrong with it.

789
01:27:20,459 --> 01:27:22,859
Go outside and make me a liar.

790
01:27:26,882 --> 01:27:29,410
I wanna talk to the man in charge.

791
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,162
Mr. Lacombe is the
highest authority.

792
01:27:32,262 --> 01:27:34,342
He isn't even an American.

793
01:27:36,475 --> 01:27:39,755
Mr. Neary, are you an artist
or a painter?

794
01:27:40,604 --> 01:27:42,604
No.

795
01:27:45,276 --> 01:27:47,264
Have you been hearing
a persistent...

796
01:27:47,364 --> 01:27:48,470
ringing in your ears?

797
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:50,514
Almost an agreeable ringing?

798
01:27:50,614 --> 01:27:52,614
No.

799
01:27:53,075 --> 01:27:55,315
Having headaches, migraines?

800
01:27:55,744 --> 01:27:57,744
Yeah.

801
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,274
An irritation in your eyes
and your sinuses?

802
01:28:00,374 --> 01:28:02,374
Yeah.

803
01:28:02,626 --> 01:28:05,838
Do you have hives?
Do you have allergies?

804
01:28:07,923 --> 01:28:10,284
And burning on your face
and on your body?

805
01:28:10,384 --> 01:28:13,120
Yes. Who are you people?
- Look at this.

806
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:17,620
I got one like it in my living room.
Who are you people?

807
01:28:22,104 --> 01:28:25,384
Monsieur Neary, please,
one more question.

808
01:28:26,358 --> 01:28:29,478
Have you recently had
a close encounter?

809
01:28:30,112 --> 01:28:33,712
A close encounter
with something very unusual?

810
01:28:36,118 --> 01:28:38,245
Who are you people?

811
01:28:44,793 --> 01:28:49,033
These people strangers to you?
- Yeah. Except for her.

812
01:28:50,966 --> 01:28:54,486
And the two of you felt compelled
to be here?

813
01:28:54,928 --> 01:28:56,928
Yeah, you might say that.

814
01:28:57,306 --> 01:29:00,826
But what did you expect to find?
- An answer.

815
01:29:02,186 --> 01:29:04,186
That's not crazy, is it?

816
01:29:20,371 --> 01:29:23,374
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

817
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:25,624
Is that it?

818
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:28,353
Is that all you're gonna ask me?

819
01:29:29,129 --> 01:29:31,740
Well, I got a couple of thousand
goddamn questions.

820
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,365
I wanna speak to
someone in charge.

821
01:29:34,465 --> 01:29:36,328
I wanna lodge a complaint.

822
01:29:36,428 --> 01:29:38,831
You have no right
to make people crazy.

823
01:29:38,931 --> 01:29:43,460
You think I investigate every
Walter Cronkite story there is?

824
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,639
If this is just nerve
gas, how come I...

825
01:29:45,739 --> 01:29:47,339
know everything in such detail?

826
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:49,679
I've never been here before.

827
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:52,150
How come I know so much?

828
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:54,388
What the hell is going on
around here?.

829
01:29:54,488 --> 01:29:56,808
Who the hell are you people?.

830
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:23,475
Is that it?. Answer me.

831
01:30:24,184 --> 01:30:28,664
I didn't come this far to get
taken on any bus ride home.

832
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:52,296
Five minutes. Five.

833
01:30:52,963 --> 01:30:56,163
We're gonna hold
for a couple of minutes.

834
01:31:29,124 --> 01:31:32,570
You brought 12 people to
the decontamination camp...

835
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:37,199
...instead of the evacuation centre
where they belong. Why?

836
01:31:37,299 --> 01:31:41,459
Because this means something.
- This means something.

837
01:31:42,012 --> 01:31:46,172
These people have come from
all over their country...

838
01:31:47,017 --> 01:31:50,546
...to a place they've been told
will endanger their lives.

839
01:31:50,646 --> 01:31:51,922
Why?

840
01:31:52,022 --> 01:31:53,932
Because somebody
could be trying...

841
01:31:54,032 --> 01:31:55,885
to subvert this whole operation...

842
01:31:55,985 --> 01:32:00,139
...by sending in fanatics, cultists
and Christ knows what all.

843
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,239
Yes.

844
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,868
Thank you very much.

845
01:32:07,037 --> 01:32:09,757
This is a small group of people...

846
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:14,211
...who have shared
a vision in common.

847
01:32:14,837 --> 01:32:16,837
Look.

848
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:22,369
It's still a mystery to me
why they are here.

849
01:32:22,469 --> 01:32:24,549
Even they do not know why.

850
01:32:43,115 --> 01:32:45,115
Jillian.

851
01:32:45,951 --> 01:32:48,229
Jillian.
- Don't. You'll be poisoned.

852
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:51,690
Listen, there's nothing wrong
with the air around here.

853
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:56,362
The Army's getting us out because
they don't want any witnesses.

854
01:32:56,462 --> 01:32:59,949
If the Army doesn't want us here,
it's none of our business.

855
01:33:00,049 --> 01:33:01,606
We wanted to see the mountain.

856
01:33:01,706 --> 01:33:03,744
It was a coincidence
when I painted it.

857
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:05,538
You can take it off.

858
01:33:05,638 --> 01:33:08,998
The air here is better
than in Los Angeles.

859
01:33:09,391 --> 01:33:12,155
Listen. How many of
you people are...

860
01:33:12,255 --> 01:33:14,255
for getting out of here?

861
01:33:18,734 --> 01:33:21,644
I don't know what's
happening either.

862
01:33:21,744 --> 01:33:24,304
I must find out what's going on.

863
01:33:26,992 --> 01:33:29,422
For every one of these anxious,

864
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:32,402
anguished people
who've come here...

865
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:37,131
...there must be
hundreds more touched...

866
01:33:37,231 --> 01:33:39,864
by the vision who
never made it here.

867
01:33:39,964 --> 01:33:43,644
Simply because they never watch
the television.

868
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:46,528
Or perhaps they watched
it, but never...

869
01:33:46,628 --> 01:33:47,997
made the psychic connection.

870
01:33:48,097 --> 01:33:51,892
It's a coincidence.
It's not scientific.

871
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:56,422
Listen to me, Major Walsh...

872
01:33:56,522 --> 01:33:59,066
...it is an event sociological.

873
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:20,129
Hey. Wait a minute.

874
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:38,297
My name's Neary.
- Larry Butler.

875
01:34:38,397 --> 01:34:40,216
How are you?
- Okay. You?

876
01:34:40,316 --> 01:34:42,316
Fine, fine.
- That's good.

877
01:34:42,735 --> 01:34:45,001
Everybody keep their
masks on until...

878
01:34:45,101 --> 01:34:47,306
you're out of here
and out of danger.

879
01:34:47,406 --> 01:34:52,206
Listen, we wanna get out of here.
What's the matter with you?

880
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:10,179
Major Walsh, Major Walsh.
- Yes, sir.

881
01:35:10,346 --> 01:35:13,082
I'll have the rest of them
off the mountain in one hour.

882
01:35:13,182 --> 01:35:16,062
Major, I want you to use infrared...

883
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:18,796
...and get me a photo analysis of
the northern face.

884
01:35:18,896 --> 01:35:21,090
Yes, sir, it's already been ordered.

885
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:23,233
Major Walsh, listen.

886
01:35:23,442 --> 01:35:25,265
I don't lik e to do this. We're in...

887
01:35:25,365 --> 01:35:27,137
enough trouble with
these cattlemen.

888
01:35:27,237 --> 01:35:31,267
If you can't get these folks
out of the area by 2000 hours...

889
01:35:31,367 --> 01:35:33,661
...start dusting with EZ-4.

890
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:35,688
What's EZ-4?

891
01:35:35,788 --> 01:35:39,275
It's a sleep aerosol. Same stuff we
used with the livestock.

892
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,943
Comes out of Riot Control.

893
01:35:41,043 --> 01:35:42,950
They'll sleep for six hours and...

894
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:45,072
wake up with a
headache, that's all.

895
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:49,034
We didn't choose this place.
We didn't choose these people.

896
01:35:49,134 --> 01:35:51,220
They were invited.

897
01:35:57,268 --> 01:35:59,668
They belong here more than we.

898
01:36:07,361 --> 01:36:09,138
I shouldn't have given up jogging.

899
01:36:09,238 --> 01:36:12,725
See that notch in the mountain?
We'll make it in no time.

900
01:36:12,825 --> 01:36:14,825
Here come three more.

901
01:36:17,371 --> 01:36:19,440
The authority in this park...

902
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:23,319
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

903
01:36:23,419 --> 01:36:26,071
There's a ravine
leading straight up.

904
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:29,091
It's an easier climb.
- It's no good.

905
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:33,037
When you get to the top, it's
a 300-foot drop down. Get down.

906
01:36:33,137 --> 01:36:36,332
What do you think is
down on the other side?

907
01:36:36,432 --> 01:36:38,362
There's a box canyon
on the other side...

908
01:36:38,462 --> 01:36:39,668
with ravines and trails...

909
01:36:39,768 --> 01:36:42,087
...if you take this incline
to the right.

910
01:36:42,187 --> 01:36:45,090
I never imagined that.
I only painted one side.

911
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:47,121
There was no canyon
in my doodles.

912
01:36:47,221 --> 01:36:48,219
Next time, sculpt.

913
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:51,347
You give us a lot of credit.
That's an hour's climb.

914
01:36:51,447 --> 01:36:53,447
Come on, let's go.

915
01:36:58,162 --> 01:37:00,748
The authority in this park...

916
01:37:00,956 --> 01:37:05,276
...has been superseded by
the United States government.

917
01:37:05,461 --> 01:37:10,007
You are entering
a military reservation...

918
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:12,926
...and subject to military law.

919
01:37:13,135 --> 01:37:15,135
Call the bastard.

920
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:20,751
Bahama, this is Pyramid. Over.

921
01:37:20,851 --> 01:37:22,127
Go ahead.

922
01:37:22,227 --> 01:37:24,672
Nothing to report at midstation.

923
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:27,800
Up ahead there's thousands
of places to hide.

924
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:32,054
We'll need three times the men
to cover this in one hour.

925
01:37:32,154 --> 01:37:33,836
Get everybody off
the northern face,

926
01:37:33,936 --> 01:37:35,474
call the dark side of the moon...

927
01:37:35,574 --> 01:37:38,294
...and tell them we're gonna dust.

928
01:38:04,019 --> 01:38:06,019
Get down.

929
01:38:06,397 --> 01:38:09,341
You are entering a military
reservation...

930
01:38:09,441 --> 01:38:13,028
...and subject to military law.

931
01:38:42,641 --> 01:38:45,561
Larry. Larry, come on.

932
01:39:03,078 --> 01:39:06,248
Larry. Don't let them see you.
Get down.

933
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:45,996
They're just crop-dusting.
Los Angeles.

934
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:52,920
Larry?
- Don't stop.

935
01:39:53,504 --> 01:39:56,224
Don't look back.
Come on, come on.

936
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:21,113
Roy.

937
01:40:26,829 --> 01:40:29,869
Hurry. We're only 10 feet
from the top.

938
01:40:29,873 --> 01:40:34,193
Just a few more feet. We can
slide down the other side.

939
01:40:40,217 --> 01:40:42,720
Come on, hurry. I'll come down.

940
01:40:42,886 --> 01:40:44,886
Don't come down.

941
01:40:44,972 --> 01:40:46,790
Come on, come on. Come on.

942
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:49,084
Don't worry. We'll make it.
- Roy.

943
01:40:49,184 --> 01:40:51,462
Come on. Come on. Move it.
Move your ass.

944
01:40:51,562 --> 01:40:53,562
Come on.

945
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:01,363
Roy, come on. Come on.
Please, come on.

946
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:04,489
Hurry.

947
01:41:05,868 --> 01:41:07,868
Hold it.

948
01:41:11,123 --> 01:41:13,123
Jump. Jump.

949
01:41:25,304 --> 01:41:28,349
Do you see that?
- Oh, yes.

950
01:41:29,058 --> 01:41:31,058
Good.

951
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:33,879
Is it on?
Check the speak er system here.

952
01:41:33,979 --> 01:41:36,148
I want this up all the way.

953
01:41:39,151 --> 01:41:41,387
Are you reading me on this one?

954
01:41:41,487 --> 01:41:43,487
How about here?

955
01:41:45,032 --> 01:41:49,286
Testing. Testing.
- Okay, one, two, three, four.

956
01:41:50,204 --> 01:41:52,064
Testing. Testing.

957
01:41:52,164 --> 01:41:55,292
One, two, three, testing.

958
01:42:02,633 --> 01:42:06,428
Gentlemen, ladies.
Tak e your positions, please.

959
01:42:07,638 --> 01:42:09,638
This is not a drill.

960
01:42:09,807 --> 01:42:13,310
I repeat, this is not a drill.

961
01:42:14,311 --> 01:42:15,943
Could we have the lights...

962
01:42:16,043 --> 01:42:18,299
in the arena down
60 percent, please?

963
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:20,399
60 percent.

964
01:42:24,405 --> 01:42:29,445
I don't think we could ask for
a more beautiful evening, do you?

965
01:42:37,042 --> 01:42:39,442
Okay, watch the skies, please.

966
01:42:40,129 --> 01:42:42,762
We now show uncorrelated targets...

967
01:42:42,862 --> 01:42:45,822
approaching from
the north-northwest.

968
01:43:35,017 --> 01:43:38,457
We're the only ones who know.
The only ones.

969
01:43:47,738 --> 01:43:49,738
You see that?

970
01:43:51,367 --> 01:43:53,185
Yes.

971
01:43:53,285 --> 01:43:55,285
Good.

972
01:44:42,751 --> 01:44:47,256
All ground personnel not
D-class approved...

973
01:44:47,464 --> 01:44:51,302
...please evacuate the centre
approach mark er.

974
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:56,348
Audio analysis personnel,
behind the double yellow line.

975
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:05,036
ITC, stereo, time and resistance.

976
01:45:05,524 --> 01:45:07,524
Auto ready?

977
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:10,513
Tone interpolation on interlock.
- Altitude and tabling.

978
01:45:10,613 --> 01:45:12,615
ARP and interlock now.

979
01:45:13,157 --> 01:45:15,659
Speed set at seven and a half.

980
01:45:15,868 --> 01:45:19,121
All positive functions, standing by.

981
01:45:43,562 --> 01:45:45,047
Go ahead.

982
01:45:45,147 --> 01:45:47,147
Sunset.
- Go.

983
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:50,069
Okay. Start with the tone.

984
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:59,117
Tang.
- Go.

985
01:45:59,328 --> 01:46:01,328
Up a full tone.

986
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:06,333
Down a major third.

987
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,460
Now drop an octave.

988
01:46:13,467 --> 01:46:14,869
Cool blue.
- Go.

989
01:46:14,969 --> 01:46:16,971
Up a perfect fifth.

990
01:46:19,556 --> 01:46:21,556
Nothing. Nothing at all.

991
01:46:26,397 --> 01:46:27,965
Give me a tone.

992
01:46:28,065 --> 01:46:30,384
'Re' to the second.
- Up a full tone.

993
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:32,469
'Mi' to the third.
- Down a major third.

994
01:46:32,569 --> 01:46:34,763
'Do' to the first.
- Drop an octave.

995
01:46:34,863 --> 01:46:36,682
'Do' up a perfect fifth.

996
01:46:36,782 --> 01:46:38,782
'Sol' to the fifth.

997
01:46:54,591 --> 01:46:56,591
I know that.

998
01:46:58,637 --> 01:47:00,637
Faster.

999
01:47:15,613 --> 01:47:17,613
Kick that mule.

1000
01:47:20,993 --> 01:47:22,993
Let's go.

1001
01:48:04,244 --> 01:48:06,021
I'm very happy tonight.

1002
01:48:06,121 --> 01:48:08,361
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1003
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:11,794
Not a Merle Haggard,
but it was great.

1004
01:48:31,438 --> 01:48:33,438
Mr. Lacombe?

1005
01:48:39,405 --> 01:48:42,116
What is it? What's happening?

1006
01:49:37,713 --> 01:49:40,299
Come on. Come on, let's go.

1007
01:49:41,926 --> 01:49:43,926
Keep down.

1008
01:49:49,224 --> 01:49:51,864
They're talking way over my head.

1009
01:51:00,379 --> 01:51:02,379
Shit.
- Duck, duck.

1010
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:39,818
Photo one.

1011
01:51:39,918 --> 01:51:43,297
Fantastic. Keep
those reloads coming.

1012
01:51:43,505 --> 01:51:45,505
Fantastic.

1013
01:51:51,722 --> 01:51:53,958
You wanna see better?
- I can see fine.

1014
01:51:54,058 --> 01:51:57,144
We can't stay here.
- I can.

1015
01:51:58,103 --> 01:52:01,690
Why?
- Because Barry's not here.

1016
01:52:02,608 --> 01:52:04,610
I'm just not ready.

1017
01:52:08,447 --> 01:52:10,724
I can't stay.
I've gotta get down there.

1018
01:52:10,824 --> 01:52:12,824
I know.

1019
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:50,030
This is data control
to all personnel.

1020
01:52:50,447 --> 01:52:53,659
We monitor no biologic hazards.

1021
01:52:53,867 --> 01:52:56,203
Range safety clear.

1022
01:54:03,729 --> 01:54:06,482
Oh, my God.

1023
01:54:59,994 --> 01:55:02,204
Oh, my God.

1024
01:55:26,186 --> 01:55:28,186
Holy shit.

1025
01:57:19,550 --> 01:57:21,911
There is a safety-hazard zone...

1026
01:57:22,011 --> 01:57:25,889
...extending 25
metres from the ship.

1027
01:57:26,307 --> 01:57:31,145
Special teams are exempt and
should be aware of low gravity.

1028
01:57:31,395 --> 01:57:35,816
Expect some dizziness,
and look out for a static charge.

1029
01:57:38,110 --> 01:57:42,110
All departments at operational
during this phase...

1030
01:57:42,197 --> 01:57:44,437
...signify by beeping twice.

1031
01:57:44,575 --> 01:57:47,937
If everything's ready here on
the dark side of the moon...

1032
01:57:48,037 --> 01:57:50,037
...play the five tones.

1033
01:58:59,149 --> 01:59:01,789
Give her six quavers, then pause.

1034
01:59:02,903 --> 01:59:04,346
She sent us four quavers...

1035
01:59:04,446 --> 01:59:08,846
...a group of five quavers,
a group of four semiquavers.

1036
01:59:22,214 --> 01:59:24,533
All these phrases have
in common are five signals.

1037
01:59:24,633 --> 01:59:26,382
Hope somebody's
taking all this down.

1038
01:59:26,482 --> 01:59:28,037
What are we saying to each other?

1039
01:59:28,137 --> 01:59:30,998
It seems they're trying to teach us
a basic tonal vocabulary.

1040
01:59:31,098 --> 01:59:33,418
It's the first day of school.

1041
01:59:40,816 --> 01:59:45,856
Take everything from the lady.
Follow her pattern note for note.

1042
02:00:00,628 --> 02:00:03,322
We have a translation interlock
on their audio signal.

1043
02:00:03,422 --> 02:00:06,542
We're taking over
this conversation now.

1044
02:01:07,569 --> 02:01:09,569
Let's go. Come on.

1045
02:02:46,126 --> 02:02:48,126
I am Claude Lacombe.

1046
02:02:51,382 --> 02:02:52,950

Einstein was right.

1065
02:03:47,563 --> 02:03:50,174
Einstein was probably
one of them.

...what do you want?

1074
02:04:46,372 --> 02:04:49,892
I just wanna know that
it's really happening.

1075
02:04:52,836 --> 02:04:57,716
I went up in the air,
and I saw our house.

1076
02:04:57,925 --> 02:05:01,078
I saw you going up in the air.
Did you see me running after you?

Yes.

Are they going away?
- Yes.

1083
02:05:28,956 --> 02:05:30,149
Wait a second, wait.

1084
02:05:30,249 --> 02:05:32,872
He says these are ordinary people...

1085
02:05:32,972 --> 02:05:35,446
under extraordinary
circumstances.

I'm told we can count on your
complete cooperation.

1093
02:08:06,947 --> 02:08:09,558
What's your blood type?
- I don't know.

1094
02:08:09,658 --> 02:08:12,436
What's your birth date?
- December 4th, 1944.

1095
02:08:12,536 --> 02:08:15,147
Have you been inoculated against
smallpox, diphtheria?

1096
02:08:15,247 --> 02:08:18,527
Is there any liver disease
in your family?

1097
02:09:17,351 --> 02:09:20,004
May the Lord be
praised at all times.

1098
02:09:20,104 --> 02:09:22,965
May God help us and grant us
a happy journey.

1099
02:09:23,065 --> 02:09:24,466
Show us your ways.

1100
02:09:24,566 --> 02:09:26,594
And lead us along your paths.

1101
02:09:26,694 --> 02:09:30,239
God has given you
his angels charge over you.

1102
02:09:30,489 --> 02:09:34,185
Grant these pilgrims, we pray,
a happy journey...

1103
02:09:34,285 --> 02:09:39,325
...and peaceful days, so that with
your holy angel as a guide...

1104
02:09:39,415 --> 02:09:42,935
...they may safely reach their
destination...

1105
02:13:24,181 --> 02:13:26,181
Bye.
