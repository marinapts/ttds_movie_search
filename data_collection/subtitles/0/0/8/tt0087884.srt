1
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,750
What the hell?

2
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,250
Hey ...

3
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,850
You know which side of the border you're on?

4
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,250
You got a name part?

5
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,350
Guess ...

6
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,350
something must have cut your tongue out.

7
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,150
either that or,

8
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,650
you got something ...

9
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,250
to hide.

10
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,250
It's all I can tell.

11
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,350
you hear me plain enough.

12
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,550
Walter A. Henderson.

13
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,250
Now I wanna ask you one last question.

14
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,850
You see this here card?

15
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,350
Is this you?

16
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,950
Or a relative of yours?

17
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,050
Well, I'm gonna call up this number,

18
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,450
and see if they can tell me who you are.

19
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,750
I ain't got beds enough to be
putting up mutes.

20
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:34,950
Operator, I need a line out please.
Los Angels, California ...

21
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,750
Uh ... what?

22
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,350
Well can you ... can you tell me
the exact location of your hospital down there?

23
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,150
where the hell is that?

24
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,950
Oh, OK, all right.

25
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,350
Yeah, uh ... OK I'll be there.
I'll get there as fast as I can.

26
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,150
Just, will you tell him that I'm coming, OK?

27
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,450
OK.

28
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,050
Steven, I think you're gonna have to change that ...

29
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,150
- This section right here?
- Yeah, because it's in the copy.

30
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,550
Anne, honey ...

31
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,250
I just got this strangest phone call.

32
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,750
Who from?

33
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,450
From some hospital in south Texas,
place called Terlingua.

34
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,950
They say they've found Travis.

35
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,450
Oh no!

36
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,750
What are you going to do?

37
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,450
- I'll go down and get him.
- Oh Walt ...

38
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,050
What am I gonna do?
I can't leave him down there!

39
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,750
What about Hunter?

40
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,250
What am I supposed to tell him?

41
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,250
I'll just tell him
I had to go on a business trip.

42
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,250
I mean about Travis.

43
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,250
Well ...

44
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,650
I guess you'd better tell him the truth.

45
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,150
10 to Van Horn, 90,

46
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,050
to Alpine, 118 south...

47
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,550
Terlingua!

48
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,550
You must be the brother of the mute.

49
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,950
- Mute?
- Yeah!

50
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,150
They couldn't squeez the time of day out of him.

51
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,050
Must be in a kind of jam. Huh?

52
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,150
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in over four years.

53
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,150
Is that right? Well ...

54
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,650
A lot can happen to a man in four years, I guess.

55
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,150
All kinds of trouble.

56
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,350
Expensive trouble.

57
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,850
What do you mean?

58
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,050
Well, down here,

59
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,150
a man gets himself into a fix sometimes,

60
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,950
It costs a little to get him out.

61
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,850
You understand what I mean.

62
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,450
I don't understand you.

63
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,150
I wish you get to the point,
'cause I'd like to see my brother.

64
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,850
All right sir,
but first I would like to ask you something.

65
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,450
Did your brother
ever get hisself into a car wreck?

66
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,250
Uh, car wreck ...? No.

67
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,150
Not that I know of.

68
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,850
Then, he must be mixing with some hard company.

69
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,350
I'd like to see my brother now,
if you don't mind.

70
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,550
He disappeared.

71
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,550
You mean, he's not here?

72
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,750
After I came all this way?

73
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,850
He's been gone
since early this morning.

74
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,550
We have his possessions. Nevertheless ...

75
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,350
saved some.

76
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,450
We'd be glad to turn them over to you,

77
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,850
soon as you take care of our little reward.

78
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,510
Travis! Hey.

79
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:27,210
Don't you recognize me?
It's Walt.

80
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,210
It's your brother, Walt.

81
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,910
What the hell happened to you anyway?
You look like fourty miles of rough road.

82
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,610
Come on, let's get in the car.
Trav?

83
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,310
Come on.

84
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,410
Here.

85
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,910
Here, Travis, your stuff.

86
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,410
I got that back at that clinic back there.

87
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,610
Sure pick the hell of a spot to land in.

88
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,610
I don't blame you for running out of it.

89
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,610
Um ... look Trav,

90
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,010
we got quite a bit of travelling to do here,

91
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,210
you're not gonna clam up the whole way, are you?

92
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,910
I mean it'd get kind of lonely.

93
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,110
Trav?

94
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,810
Would you mind telling me
where you disappeared to for the last four years?

95
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,510
Uh ... have you seen Jane? Or talk to her?

96
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,310
Gee, Anne and I uh ...

97
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,910
we sort of gave up on you, we actually ...

98
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,710
we thought you were dead, boy.

99
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,010
Well it's pretty uh ...

100
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,010
OK.

101
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,310
Well uh ...

102
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,910
Yeah.

103
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,510
Oh, Gee, Trav, maybe you wanna ...

104
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,510
get cleaned up, you know,
take a shower or something?

105
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,910
Uh ... I think I'll go back into town,
I'll get you some new clothes.

106
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,010
You could use a new set of clothes, couldn't ya?

107
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,610
What si- size shoes you wear?

108
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,510
Let's see.

109
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,010
They're probably one size bigger, huh?

110
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,110
So where did you find that beard?

111
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,510
It's pretty snazzy.

112
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,110
OK I'll zip into town,
and zip right back.

113
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,010
I won't be gone long.

114
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,310
You'll be OK, won't you, Trav?

115
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,710
Yeah I'll- I will be right back.

116
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,210
Damn it!

117
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,110
You mind telling me where you're headed, Trav?

118
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,610
What's out there?

119
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,810
There's nothing out there.

120
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,210
Don't you trust me or something, huh?

121
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,210
I'm just trying to help you, Trav.
That's all.

122
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,710
Come on, it's all right.

123
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,810
Come on with me in the car.

124
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,210
Huh?

125
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,510
Bet it feels good to be in new clothes, huh?

126
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,510
Hello?

127
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,110
Hi, Hunter, it's Daddy.

128
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,110
I thought you'd be in bed already.

129
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,810
I'm not sleepy.

130
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,910
Guess who I'm visiting ... here in Texas?

131
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,510
Who?

132
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,910
Your father.

133
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,310
Do you remember your father?

134
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,210
No.

135
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,110
Not at all?

136
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,210
I remember he was kind of skinny.

137
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,110
He was?

138
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,910
Sort of.

139
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,110
Well guess what?

140
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,910
I don't know.

141
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,110
I'm gonna bring him home to visit.

142
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,210
Travis,

143
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,710
do you remember your little boy, Hunter?

144
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,810
Well he's with us.

145
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,310
He's been living with Anne and me
ever since you disappeared.

146
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,110
We didn't know what else to do.

147
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,510
So, we just kept him.

148
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,610
One day,

149
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,010
he was just standing at the door.

150
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,710
All he could tell us was
someone brought him there in a car.

151
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,010
He didn't know what'd happened to you,

152
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,510
or Jane.

153
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,910
So we tried everything we could think of to find you, or Jane.

154
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,010
Tried to locate her, she'd vanished too.

155
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,010
We didn't know what else to do.

156
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,210
Travis,

157
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,310
I don't know what kind of trouble you got into.

158
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,110
I don't know what happened.

159
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,410
But damn it,
I am your brother, man.

160
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,510
You can talk to me.

161
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,010
I'm tired of doing all the talking.

162
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,010
Fill it with unleaded, please.

163
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,310
You know, I'm getting a little sick of this silence routine.

164
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,510
You can talk!

165
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,810
I can be silent too, you know.

166
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,710
I'd just as soon that both of us keep our mouths shut
for the whole rest of the trip. You don't ...

167
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,510
What?

168
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,810
Paris.

169
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,010
Paris.

170
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,610
Paris?

171
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,910
Did you ever go to Paris?

172
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,210
No.

173
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,110
Could we go there now?

174
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,110
It's a little out of the way.

175
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,910
Oh, no, I've never even been to Europe.

176
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,310
Anne keeps wanting to go there.

177
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,510
'Cause what's, she's from France, you remember?

178
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,110
But we never seemed to find the time,

179
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,610
'cause my company keeps me kind of busy.

180
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,110
Let's go Trav.

181
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,910
What's the matter?

182
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,710
Where're we going?

183
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,310
We're gonna fly to L.A.

184
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,610
You are not afraid of flying, are you?

185
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,310
We're ... leaving the ground?

186
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,710
Yeah.

187
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,210
Why?

188
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,210
Because it's too far to drive.

189
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,110
It would take extra two days.
I can't afford the time, Trav.

190
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,210
Why?

191
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,410
B-It's just easier to fly, Trav.
It's faster.

192
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,510
Come on.

193
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,010
I'll get you home, OK.

194
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,610
When I get you home, get you settled,
then you can do whatever you want.

195
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,910
Let me out, would you?

196
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,510
Sir, we can't stop the plane
every time somebody gets terrified.

197
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,910
Don't get on the plane
and then refuse to leave the ground!

198
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,610
Don't do things like that!
This is no wilderness.

199
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,010
You are out with people now.

200
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,510
- OK?
- You should have hired a private plane.

201
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,810
Do you realize how many people you're detaining?

202
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,510
Sorry!

203
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,810
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! OK!

204
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,810
- OK, bye now.
- Bye now.

205
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,110
This is getting a little ridiculous, Travis.

206
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,810
Are you gonna leave me?

207
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,610
No, I'm not gonna leave you.

208
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,810
It's all right if you leave me.

209
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,310
I don't know, honey, no.
He just, he just panicked or something.

210
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,310
Well, it won't do any good to try another plane.
It wasn't the plane.

211
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,410
He'll just get off again.

212
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,410
Well,

213
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,110
we're just gonna have to drive it, that's all.

214
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,810
Yeah, it'll take to good two days.

215
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,310
... I don't understand why you have to have
the very same car you had before?

216
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,510
They are all alike.

217
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,910
All the cars we have here are Birds,

218
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,010
Olds, and Chevies, or whatever.

219
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,610
I am not even sure
I can locate the same car ...

220
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,510
- you had before.
- I know, I know.

221
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,710
Uh, my brother left something in the car.

222
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,810
we hope we can search the car and find it.

223
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,410
Oh well, I'll just contact the lost and found department ...

224
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,310
- for you, if that's the case sir.
- No, no, we have to have the very same car.

225
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,910
Well I can't do that!

226
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,510
There's no way I can trace that car for you.

227
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,410
Why not?
You got the license number right on your form there.

228
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,910
- Well, yeah.
- Just give us the license number, We'll find it.

229
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,710
But I can't allow you on the lot, sir.

230
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,910
Why not? We're already on it!

231
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,210
I just have to ask you
to come back to the office with me.

232
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,810
- Travis!
- What?

233
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,510
I don't think we're gonna get the very same car.

234
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,410
But I can rent you mile
that just like the one you rent before, sir.

235
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,510
We need the same car, Walt.
How are we gonna go on another car?

236
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,610
Give us the number, will you please!

237
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,810
Come on, Pretty please!

238
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,310
All right, that number is 667-DJP.

239
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,710
- Remember that? 667-DJP.
- That's right.

240
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,910
- It's-it's got a bump on the hood.
- Yes, it does.

241
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,610
- What's that?
- What?

242
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,610
That you got in your hand.

243
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,410
A picture.

244
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,210
A picture of what?

245
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,210
A picture of...

246
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:11,010
of uh ... Paris.

247
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,510
Paris? Really?

248
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,710
Yes. A picture of a piece of Paris.

249
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,910
Where did you get a picture of Paris?

250
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,610
Can I see it?

251
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,310
Yes.

252
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,110
This is it? This is Paris?

253
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,510
Looks just like Texas to me.

254
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,210
It is.

255
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,310
Paris, Texas?

256
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,110
It's right here on the map.

257
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,810
Is there really a place called "Paris, Texas"?

258
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,210
It's right here!

259
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,610
How come you get a picture
of a vacant lot of Paris, Texas?

260
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,710
It's mine.

261
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,710
I know that, but how come you got it?

262
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,010
I purchased it, in the mail, ...

263
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,910
a long time ago.

264
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,110
You bought a picture of a vacant lot in the mail?

265
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,510
No, I bought the land.

266
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,010
Oh you bought that lot.

267
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,210
-Yes.
- Oh, let me see it again.

268
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,510
There's nothing on it.

269
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,910
Empty.

270
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,610
Why in hell would you want to buy a
vacant lot in Paris, Texas for Christ's sake?

271
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,310
Um ...

272
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,710
I forgot.

273
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,210
Here, Trav.

274
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,410
Do you remember our Mama's very first name was?

275
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,310
Mary.

276
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:43,210
No, I know.
I mean, uh her ... before she found Daddy.

277
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,410
- Her maiden name?
- Yeah.

278
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,110
You don't remember her maiden name?

279
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,610
No.

280
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,810
Sequine.

281
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,210
Sequine.

282
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,810
Spanish?

283
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,510
Her father was.

284
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,710
Yeah.

285
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,010
I don't believe it!

286
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,010
You finally decided to eat!

287
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,110
Eating and talking!

288
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,810
Before you know it,
you'll be back in the land of living, Trav.

289
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,310
You want me to drive?

290
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,210
Sure.
Think you remember how?

291
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,310
My body remembers.

292
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,410
You can sleep while I drive.

293
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,510
OK.

294
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,010
Well Trav,

295
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,710
think maybe you're ready to ...

296
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,210
tell me what the hell happened to you
over the last four years?

297
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,510
No, not yet.

298
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,810
Travis!

299
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,910
What?

300
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,110
Where are we Travis?
What happened?

301
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,810
Why did we get off the highway?

302
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,710
Jesus Christ!

303
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,410
I can't even sleep for five minutes
without some crisis!

304
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,710
Why did you turn off?

305
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,210
I don't know where I turned off.
It didn't have a name.

306
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,410
That's great.
That's just dandy.

307
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,310
Here we are in the middle of the Mojave Desert,
in a place that doesn't have a name!

308
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,210
I can find the highway again.

309
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,910
Trav, I need to talk to you a little bit about Hunter.

310
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,510
How old is he now?

311
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,410
He's eight in January.

312
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,810
He's seven then.

313
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,410
Yeah.

314
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,710
But see what I want to talk about is uh ...

315
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,210
well, he's-he's like part of the family now.

316
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,410
Anne and me are like his parents now.

317
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,810
Anne's your wife?

318
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,510
Yeah. You remember her, don't you?

319
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,610
No.
Does he think that you are his father?

320
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:19,910
Well ...

321
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,910
Anne told him you were coming.

322
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,510
Well who does he think I am?

323
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,510
I-I told him you are his father.

324
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,710
But see ...

325
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,910
well you've been gone a long time, Trav.

326
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,510
How long have I been gone, do you know?

327
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,210
Four years.

328
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,810
Is four years a long time?

329
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,610
Well, it is for a little boy.

330
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,910
It's half his life.

331
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,610
Half a boy's life.

332
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,610
I remember now!

333
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,410
What?

334
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,210
Why I bought that land.

335
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,410
Oh, Why?

336
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,910
Well ...

337
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,110
Mama once told me that uh ...

338
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,810
that's where she and Daddy ... first ...

339
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,410
made love.

340
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,210
Oh, in Paris, Texas?

341
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,110
Yeah.

342
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,910
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

343
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,010
So ... I figured that

344
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,710
that's where I-I have began.

345
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,810
I mean me, Travis Clay Henderson.
They named me that.

346
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,610
I started out there.

347
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,310
- Paris, Texas huh?
- Yeah.

348
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,110
So you think maybe you were conceived there?

349
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,310
- Yeah.
- You could be right, Travis.

350
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,110
Daddy always had a joke about it.

351
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,010
What was the joke?

352
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,810
He's uh ... he would introduce Mama

353
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,210
as the girl he met in Paris.

354
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,810
Then he'd waited uh ...

355
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,010
before he said "Texas" till everybody thought that ...

356
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,010
he meant ...

357
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,010
he would wait before he said "Texas" till everybody thought ...

358
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,910
after everyone thought he was talking about Paris, France.

359
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,610
He always laughed real hard about it.

360
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,510
So you live in Los Angeles, huh?

361
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,110
Yeah, well we live in the suburbs
but I got my business in town.

362
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,210
What's your business?

363
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,110
I make billboard signs for advertising.

364
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,510
Oh, yeah?

365
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,210
So you're the one who makes those, huh?
I love those.

366
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,810
Some of them are beautiful.

367
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,110
I'm not the only one in the world
that makes them, Trav.

368
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,310
Trav? This way.

369
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,110
Nice, huh?
Just been in here three months.

370
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,910
I really like it.
But I took a beating on the financing, I'll tell you.

371
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,210
Like everybody else in L.A., I guess.

372
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,410
Hi, baby.

373
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,210
Is everything OK here?

374
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,010
Oh sure, we just missed you a lot.

375
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,610
Yeah, I missed you too.

376
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,810
- Come on in.
- Travis.

377
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,910
My God!

378
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:53,210
We were beginning to wonder
if we'd ever see you again.

379
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,110
It's been so long.

380
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,910
Did you have a good trip?

381
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,810
Yeah, it was fine.

382
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,210
Hunter?

383
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:19,310
Hunter, this is Travis.

384
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,910
Hi.

385
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,210
Hi.

386
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,610
I bet it was really hard

387
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,610
coming across the Mojave Desert.

388
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:54,710
Yes.

389
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,310
Too bad you have to drive.

390
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,510
What happened?

391
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,410
Well, Travis just ... didn't feel like flying.

392
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,210
Oh, I don't blame you.

393
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,210
I can't stand airplanes any more.

394
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,210
Especially since we live in this house.

395
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,710
All we hear is planes,

396
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,310
day in and day out.

397
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,510
I like them.

398
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,710
You used to fly, didn't you Travis?

399
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,910
No.

400
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,510
Oh, I thought I remember Jane

401
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,410
telling me once that you flew to Dallas together ...

402
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,610
or elsewhere.

403
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,610
Um ...

404
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,610
Maybe I'm mistaken.

405
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,810
Honey, he hasn't slept in a bed
since we started for here,

406
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,310
I swear to God.

407
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,510
I don't think that's even necessary.

408
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,810
Where has he been sleeping, then?

409
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,310
Well, he doesn't sleep.

410
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,810
He has to sleep somewhere!

411
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,010
OK!

412
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,910
I don't think he's even gonna use it.

413
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,510
He's got to get tired sometime!

414
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:28,810
Oh.

415
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,810
There is a towel for you, Travis.

416
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,710
And some underware and socks from Walt.

417
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,510
Good night.

418
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,410
Thank you.

419
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,010
OK, get some shuteye.

420
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,410
OK.

421
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,210
- Sweet dreams.
- All right.

422
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,910
You polished them!

423
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,310
That's very nice of you, Travis.

424
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,410
Would you like to come in
and have some breakfast?

425
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,010
Aren't you hungry?

426
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,710
We are going to have strawberry waffles.

427
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,710
Do you like them?

428
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,210
Do you want some?

429
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,710
Well,

430
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,310
there is hot coffee on the stove,
if you want some.

431
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,610
Look at that truck!

432
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,310
Hi.

433
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:52,510
- Decided to rough it, huh?
- Yeah.

434
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,710
How did you do? Spitshine these?

435
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,610
I can get you a job in the airport doing that.

436
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,610
You want to trade these new boots
for those old boots?

437
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,910
Yeah, you can wear them.

438
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,810
Thank you.

439
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,610
Travis.

440
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,210
I have to rush out to get Hunter to school on time.

441
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,310
We will be back this afternoon.

442
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,410
Walt's office number is on the dining room table.

443
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,110
See you later.

444
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,310
- OK.
- Bye.

445
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,010
- Anne.
- Yeah?

446
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,410
I was just think maybe uh ...
I could meet Hunter after school

447
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,610
and we could walk home together,
if he wants to.

448
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,910
Uh, that sounds like a great idea, Travis.

449
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:37,410
Walk home?
I don't want to walk home, Mom.

450
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,410
- Why?
- Nobody walks, everybody drives.

451
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,510
Come on Hunter, it won't hurt you to

452
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,410
walk home once in your life.

453
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,510
No, no, I don't want to.

454
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,110
- Travis, I insist! It's what you're looking forward.
- Eveybody will see me!

455
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,210
Walt can tell you how to get there.
It is not far.

456
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,710
Get in the car, Hunter.
We are late it is.

457
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,310
You're mean.

458
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,510
- Can I come with you?
- Sure.

459
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,610
I'm really sorry about this, Travis.

460
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,910
It's not easy for him, Anne.

461
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,810
Anne it's OK. He's in here.

462
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,710
What're you doing?

463
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:07,710
Driving.

464
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:09,710
Where to?

465
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,110
Just driving.

466
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,010
You're not hiding out in there, are you?

467
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,510
No.

468
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:24,710
Hunter,
Travis is your real Dad.

469
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,010
You know that, don't you?

470
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,210
Dad, when are they gonna make spaceships like they ...

471
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,610
make cars?

472
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:37,110
Hunter, I'm asking you a question.
Can you answer it?

473
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,910
What?

474
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,110
Well, Travis went to meet you at school,

475
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:46,810
and he wanted to walk you home.

476
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:49,410
Nobody walks.

477
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,810
That's not the point.

478
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,310
Travis is your real Dad and ...

479
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,110
he wants to talk to you.

480
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,910
Why?
What about?

481
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,610
OK, come on, let's go have dinner.

482
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,010
Come on.

483
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:17,310
Hey Trav,

484
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,110
do you remember the time that Anne and me
came on a visit to you about five years ago?

485
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,010
No.

486
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:28,110
You and Jane were down in Texas right there on the coast.

487
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,210
Hunter was about three.

488
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,610
Don't you remember that?

489
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,410
No.

490
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,310
I remember. We went fishing.

491
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,310
Yeah.

492
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:45,010
I took some super8 on that trip.
And I put it all together.

493
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,410
Thought maybe you might like to see some of them.

494
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,710
What is it?

495
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,110
Movies. You know, super8.

496
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:53,910
- Oh!
- Walt,

497
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,910
maybe Travis doesn't want ...

498
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:58,010
What?

499
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:03,110
Well, maybe he'd like to wait a while
before he looks at it.

500
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,210
You know, it's up to him.

501
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,810
I just thought maybe he'd like to see some of it.

502
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,110
Movies? Sure.

503
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,310
Great!

504
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,010
There's some great stuff on it.
Some great shots of Hunter in it.

505
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:17,010
I've already seen it.

506
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:18,710
Well, you have to see it again.

507
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,010
Come on, help me set up the projector.

508
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,510
OK.

509
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:48,610
That's me driving.

510
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,810
I know you're gonna be good.

511
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,910
Time for bed now, Hunter.

512
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,910
Oh, Mom!

513
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,810
Don't complain.
It's past 10.

514
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:00,710
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, baby.

515
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,810
Good night, Dad.

516
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,950
Do you think he still loves her?

517
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:17,250
How would I know that, Hunter?

518
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,050
I think he does.

519
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,850
How can you tell?

520
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,850
The way he looked at her.

521
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,050
You mean when you saw him in the movie?

522
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,050
Yeah, that's not her.

523
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:31,750
What do you mean?

524
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,850
That's only her in a movie ...

525
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:38,150
a long time ago ...

526
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,650
in a galaxy far far away.

527
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,150
What are you looking for?

528
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,750
Um, I'm looking for ...

529
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,950
the Father.

530
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,250
Your father?

531
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,450
No, no, just a father.
Any father.

532
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,350
What does a father look like?

533
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,850
There're many different kinds of fathers,
Senor Travis.

534
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,550
Well I just ... I just need one.

535
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,150
You think you're gonna find him in there?

536
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,850
Well I don't know where else to look.

537
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:42,150
Oh I see.
You want to look like a father?

538
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,250
Yeah.

539
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,650
Tell me:
do you want to be a rich father?

540
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:50,750
No.

541
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,850
- A poor one?
- No.

542
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,050
Eso gonpus.

543
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:56,550
In between.

544
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,450
No, no, there is no in-between.

545
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,050
You'd either be a rich father,
or a poor one.

546
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,350
Rich.

547
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,150
Bueno, un momento.

548
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:18,350
- Que Tal, eh?
- Esta, Bueno.

549
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,650
OK, one thing you must remember:

550
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,250
to be a rich father, Senor Travis,
you must look to the sky,

551
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,050
and never at the ground.

552
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,550
A little higher.

553
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,250
Eso. Mm-hmm.

554
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,950
Walk a minute.

555
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,150
No, este ...

556
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:42,050
You must walk stiff, Senor Travis.

557
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:51,250
Con confianza, cme, entiente?
Con respecto.

558
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,750
- Dignity!
- Eso.

559
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,850
Con dignidad.

560
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,350
Mm-hmm ...

561
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,650
You got it!

562
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:31,350
Who is that guy?
You know him?

563
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,350
Yeah, he's my father's brother.

564
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:41,350
No, they're both brothers.
No, they're both ...

565
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:43,950
they are both fathers.

566
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,150
No, forget it.

567
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,850
Both whos fathers?
My fathers.

568
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,250
H-how how can you have two fathers?

569
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,050
Just lucky I guess.

570
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:58,050
- Well bye.
- Bye.

571
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,442
That's my Dad's suit.

572
01:00:49,142 --> 01:00:50,342
I mean Walt.

573
01:00:50,742 --> 01:00:52,542
That's OK if you call him Dad.

574
01:00:53,642 --> 01:00:56,242
Yeah, I borrowed from him.
He said it was OK.

575
01:01:01,642 --> 01:01:03,142
What're those pictures?

576
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:05,342
That's my Dad.

577
01:01:06,942 --> 01:01:08,442
And your grandfather.

578
01:01:12,142 --> 01:01:13,342
What was his name?

579
01:01:13,742 --> 01:01:16,942
- Travis.
- Same as yours.

580
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,442
Where is he now?

581
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:22,442
He died ...

582
01:01:23,242 --> 01:01:25,242
a couple of years after this picture,

583
01:01:25,842 --> 01:01:27,042
in that car.

584
01:01:27,342 --> 01:01:29,242
Oh, he's dead.

585
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:32,842
Well can you feel
that he's dead?

586
01:01:33,242 --> 01:01:34,742
What do you mean?

587
01:01:35,242 --> 01:01:37,042
You know when he was walking around,

588
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:38,942
and talking, right?

589
01:01:38,942 --> 01:01:39,942
Yeah.

590
01:01:39,942 --> 01:01:42,142
So, can you feel that
he's gone?

591
01:01:43,842 --> 01:01:46,442
Yeah, sometimes.
I know he's dead.

592
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:50,742
I never felt like you were dead.

593
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:52,742
I could always feel you walking around,

594
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,342
- talking, someplace.
- Yeah.

595
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:58,642
- I feel Mom too.
- You do?

596
01:01:59,142 --> 01:02:00,342
Don't you?

597
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,642
Yeah.

598
01:02:06,342 --> 01:02:08,042
It's me, when I was in the Navy.

599
01:02:09,242 --> 01:02:10,442
You were a General?

600
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:13,842
No, that's when I was in the band.

601
01:02:14,542 --> 01:02:15,842
A high school band.

602
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:21,442
And here's you. I like this picture.
Look at that!

603
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:23,342
That is really wild.

604
01:02:23,642 --> 01:02:26,442
It is wierd when it
when there is water in between ...

605
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:29,242
and then it turns into nothing,
then goes pfew.

606
01:02:29,642 --> 01:02:31,742
Yeah, it's a great picture.

607
01:02:32,942 --> 01:02:34,442
And this is my Mom.

608
01:02:36,342 --> 01:02:37,342
Your grandmother.

609
01:02:42,442 --> 01:02:43,242
I don't know ...

610
01:02:47,842 --> 01:02:48,942
It just seems that ...

611
01:02:48,942 --> 01:02:52,142
everything has changed
between us so fast,

612
01:02:52,142 --> 01:02:54,342
ever since Travis came.

613
01:02:54,642 --> 01:02:55,842
What's changed?

614
01:02:57,842 --> 01:02:59,042
I'm just afraid.

615
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:01,942
You're afraid of Travis?

616
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:03,342
No.

617
01:03:04,242 --> 01:03:05,242
Then what?

618
01:03:08,442 --> 01:03:11,242
Of what will happen to us
if we lose Hunter.

619
01:03:14,742 --> 01:03:16,242
We're not gonna lose Hunter.

620
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:19,142
Then why do you keep pushing them together?

621
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:22,442
It's almost as if you wanted him to leave.

622
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:23,942
Who?

623
01:03:24,642 --> 01:03:25,542
Hunter.

624
01:03:26,442 --> 01:03:28,542
You know what I'm talking about.

625
01:03:28,842 --> 01:03:32,042
You keep promoting this father-son
business between them.

626
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:33,842
It's not business!

627
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:37,942
Travis is his father!
And Hunter is his son!

628
01:03:38,242 --> 01:03:41,942
That's a fact.
We've known that all along.

629
01:03:43,442 --> 01:03:45,242
And Travis happens to be my brother.

630
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:46,642
I know he is.

631
01:03:46,942 --> 01:03:49,042
Then what's this promotion bullshit?

632
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:50,742
You want us to go on pretending

633
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:53,442
that we are the parents of my brother's son?

634
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:55,842
How long do you expect Hunter
to buy that?

635
01:03:56,142 --> 01:03:58,342
I was never pretending!

636
01:03:58,642 --> 01:04:02,242
I love him just like
he was my own flesh and blood.

637
01:04:03,642 --> 01:04:04,942
So do I.

638
01:04:15,242 --> 01:04:18,642
- Hi, Anne.
- Hi, Travis.

639
01:04:18,642 --> 01:04:20,542
You don't sleep much, do you?

640
01:04:29,842 --> 01:04:30,842
Travis, ...

641
01:04:32,642 --> 01:04:34,642
there's something I have to tell you.

642
01:04:34,942 --> 01:04:36,542
I was not going to,

643
01:04:36,842 --> 01:04:40,242
because somehow it makes things easier
that nobody knows.

644
01:04:41,242 --> 01:04:44,042
I never even told
Walt or Hunter.

645
01:04:45,642 --> 01:04:46,942
Well, what is it?

646
01:04:49,742 --> 01:04:52,142
After Hunter came
to live with us,

647
01:04:52,842 --> 01:04:54,242
Jane used to call,

648
01:04:55,742 --> 01:04:57,642
asking about him.

649
01:04:58,042 --> 01:05:02,042
She made me promise
not to tell anyone she was calling.

650
01:05:02,342 --> 01:05:03,942
Did she ask about me?

651
01:05:06,642 --> 01:05:09,242
Yes, in the beginning.

652
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,642
Where did she call from?

653
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:17,542
Places in Texas.

654
01:05:17,842 --> 01:05:19,142
What places?

655
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:24,442
Let me finish, Travis.

656
01:05:27,342 --> 01:05:30,242
After what happened
between you and Jane,

657
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:34,242
she decided Hunter
should be with us.

658
01:05:35,742 --> 01:05:38,342
She said she couldn't be a mother
to him any more.

659
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:49,142
She stopped being a mother to him
a long time before that.

660
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:03,242
Travis, I don't want to feel

661
01:06:03,242 --> 01:06:06,042
I'm hiding something from you anymore.

662
01:06:11,442 --> 01:06:12,642
She was young.

663
01:06:18,242 --> 01:06:19,442
She wanted something,

664
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:22,142
I just couldn't figure out what it was.

665
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,142
I just didn't realize
how much rage I had.

666
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:42,242
A little more than a year ago,
she stopped calling.

667
01:06:42,842 --> 01:06:44,842
I haven't heard from her since then.

668
01:06:46,342 --> 01:06:47,342
Nothing?

669
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:50,342
Not a word.

670
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:52,942
But on the last call,

671
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:57,442
she asked me to open
a bank account for Hunter.

672
01:06:58,442 --> 01:06:59,942
A bank account?

673
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:03,042
All I know about Jane now is ...

674
01:07:03,942 --> 01:07:05,642
she goes to this bank

675
01:07:06,142 --> 01:07:08,342
on the fifth of each month

676
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,442
and wires money for Hunter.

677
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:17,442
Jane still sends him money.

678
01:07:18,842 --> 01:07:22,842
Sometimes a hundred dollars,
sometimes fifty, or five.

679
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:25,742
For Hunter's future.

680
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:28,742
I had the bank
trace the wire.

681
01:07:29,942 --> 01:07:31,642
It comes from a bank
in Houston.

682
01:07:32,242 --> 01:07:33,542
What bank?

683
01:07:34,942 --> 01:07:37,642
I wrote it down if you want it.

684
01:07:40,742 --> 01:07:42,242
what's the date today?

685
01:07:42,542 --> 01:07:44,142
The first of November.

686
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:51,842
I don't think we should do that.

687
01:07:51,842 --> 01:07:52,942
You're right.

688
01:07:55,242 --> 01:07:56,642
I meant the other thing.

689
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:20,242
You will all be caught
with your diapers down!

690
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:22,242
That is a promise!

691
01:08:22,642 --> 01:08:26,542
I make you this promise
on my mother's head!

692
01:08:27,242 --> 01:08:32,342
For right here, today. Standing on the very head of my mother,

693
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,542
which is now on God's green earth,

694
01:08:35,842 --> 01:08:39,342
which everybody
who wasn't born in a fucking sewer

695
01:08:39,642 --> 01:08:43,942
ought to know and understand
to the very marrow of their bones!

696
01:08:45,642 --> 01:08:48,042
They will invade you
in your beds,

697
01:08:48,842 --> 01:08:51,642
they will snatch you from your hot tubs,

698
01:08:52,142 --> 01:08:56,042
they will pluck you right out of
your fancy sports cars!

699
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,042
There is nowhere,

700
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,942
absolutely nowhere,

701
01:09:02,942 --> 01:09:05,442
in this God forsaken valley.

702
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:10,842
I'm talking about from the range of my voice,
right here

703
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:14,242
clear out to the goddamn Mohjave Desert

704
01:09:14,542 --> 01:09:16,342
and beyond that,

705
01:09:16,742 --> 01:09:19,942
clear out past Barstows

706
01:09:19,942 --> 01:09:23,042
and everywhere else in the valley all the way to Arizona.

707
01:09:24,142 --> 01:09:27,142
None of that area will be called the safety zone!

708
01:09:27,742 --> 01:09:29,742
There will be no safety zone!

709
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:31,942
I can guarantee you
the safety zone

710
01:09:32,242 --> 01:09:33,542
will be eliminated.

711
01:09:33,842 --> 01:09:35,342
Eradicated.

712
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:40,542
You will all be extradited
to the land of no return!

713
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:43,842
It's a navigation to nowhere.

714
01:09:44,542 --> 01:09:47,042
And if you think
that's going to be fun,

715
01:09:47,442 --> 01:09:49,542
you've got another think coming.

716
01:09:51,542 --> 01:09:53,742
I maybe a slime-bucket,

717
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:58,042
but believe me:
I know what the hell I am talking about.

718
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:00,142
I am not crazy.

719
01:10:00,842 --> 01:10:03,042
And don't say
I didn't warn you!

720
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:07,042
I warned you! I warned all of you!

721
01:10:17,742 --> 01:10:19,442
Thought you were afraid of heights?

722
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:23,042
No, I'm not afraid of heights,
I'm afraid of falling.

723
01:10:23,342 --> 01:10:25,442
Oh yeah, well just don't look down.

724
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:32,242
Too bad, things don't look the same on the ground.

725
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:34,442
What do you mean?

726
01:10:34,442 --> 01:10:36,642
Well, things are clearer up here.

727
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:42,042
- Might clear things up.
- Yeah, I had a  talk with Anne last night.

728
01:10:42,842 --> 01:10:44,942
Yeah, she's pretty upset.

729
01:10:44,942 --> 01:10:46,942
Yeah, I know.

730
01:10:48,642 --> 01:10:49,542
I'm gonna leave.

731
01:10:50,342 --> 01:10:52,642
- What?
- I'm leaving.

732
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:56,542
I didn't tell you this in order to make you leave.
I am not trying to get rid of you, Travis.

733
01:10:56,542 --> 01:10:57,042
I know that.

734
01:10:57,042 --> 01:11:01,042
What good is that gonna do?
It's not gonna solve anything.

735
01:11:01,242 --> 01:11:03,042
I'm gonna find Jane.

736
01:11:04,542 --> 01:11:06,342
How are you gonna do that?

737
01:11:06,342 --> 01:11:08,742
It's been four years!
She's completely disappeared.

738
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:11,042
I tried to find her.
I've tried everything I couldn't find her.

739
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:12,742
well, I haven't tried it yet.

740
01:11:13,042 --> 01:11:15,242
- I can find her.
- What makes you so sure?

741
01:11:15,242 --> 01:11:16,242
I just know.

742
01:11:16,842 --> 01:11:18,042
Can we go down now?

743
01:11:18,042 --> 01:11:18,942
No.

744
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,342
Goddamn it!

745
01:11:21,642 --> 01:11:24,042
You tell me what happened, Travis!

746
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:26,142
I'm sick of this fucking mystery.

747
01:11:26,142 --> 01:11:28,142
I've been treating you
like a spoiled kid

748
01:11:28,142 --> 01:11:29,742
ever since I picked you up in the desert .

749
01:11:29,742 --> 01:11:32,542
Now, you tell me what happened with you and Jane!

750
01:11:32,942 --> 01:11:34,642
Shit!

751
01:11:35,842 --> 01:11:37,842
I know it's none of my business.

752
01:11:39,742 --> 01:11:41,942
Uh, I'm gonna need to take uh ...

753
01:11:43,142 --> 01:11:45,142
money, credit cards.

754
01:11:45,642 --> 01:11:47,542
All right, sure, you can have them.

755
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:50,442
- You know you'll get it back.
- Oh, forget that, you can keep them.

756
01:11:50,742 --> 01:11:51,942
I want to find her, Walt.

757
01:12:16,622 --> 01:12:17,722
Hunter!

758
01:12:27,522 --> 01:12:29,122
Is that your car?

759
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:34,722
Yep. Come on.

760
01:12:36,322 --> 01:12:37,722
Radical!

761
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:52,422
This is not bad stuff.

762
01:12:54,422 --> 01:12:56,322
Anne puts it in lunch everyday.

763
01:12:56,822 --> 01:12:59,522
La vache qui rit. Sticky.

764
01:13:00,322 --> 01:13:02,322
"La vache" what?

765
01:13:03,022 --> 01:13:05,022
Rit rrr rit.

766
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,522
Rit rrr rit.

767
01:13:07,522 --> 01:13:08,922
I like it.

768
01:13:11,622 --> 01:13:13,722
- Dad?
- Yep.

769
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:16,222
Where did you go all that time?

770
01:13:18,822 --> 01:13:19,822
Mexico.

771
01:13:20,322 --> 01:13:21,722
How come?

772
01:13:23,522 --> 01:13:25,522
I didn't know where else to go.

773
01:13:27,322 --> 01:13:29,022
Where did Mom go?

774
01:13:30,622 --> 01:13:31,922
I don't know.

775
01:13:32,322 --> 01:13:34,622
But right now,
she's somewhere in Houston.

776
01:13:34,622 --> 01:13:37,022
That's where the Space Center is.

777
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:38,122
Yeah.

778
01:13:39,922 --> 01:13:42,022
That's what I want to talk to you about.

779
01:13:42,922 --> 01:13:44,822
I gotta go away now.

780
01:13:44,822 --> 01:13:45,922
Why?

781
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,222
'Cause I'm gonna find her.

782
01:13:48,222 --> 01:13:51,622
What about me? You just found me!
Can I come with?

783
01:13:56,422 --> 01:13:57,622
What about Walt and Anne?

784
01:13:58,122 --> 01:14:00,222
We will never come back here?

785
01:14:00,222 --> 01:14:04,022
Well, sure but ...
I don't know when.

786
01:14:13,822 --> 01:14:15,022
I want to come with.

787
01:14:17,922 --> 01:14:19,322
I want to find her, too.

788
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,122
When do we go?

789
01:14:26,222 --> 01:14:27,622
Right now.

790
01:14:27,622 --> 01:14:29,022
Come on, let's go.

791
01:14:29,822 --> 01:14:32,722
First, we gotta stop
to get some supplies for the trip.

792
01:14:32,722 --> 01:14:34,022
OK.

793
01:14:49,022 --> 01:14:52,422
We gotta buy jackets, T-shirts, toothbrushes

794
01:14:52,422 --> 01:14:55,722
stuff like that, maybe even walkie-talkies.

795
01:14:55,722 --> 01:14:58,922
- Talkies? What for?
- Just in case.

796
01:15:06,122 --> 01:15:08,222
- Do you know what?
- What?

797
01:15:10,922 --> 01:15:14,122
This whole galaxy,
the whole universe

798
01:15:14,422 --> 01:15:17,922
used to be compressed
into a tiny spot this big.

799
01:15:18,622 --> 01:15:21,522
- And, and you know what happened?
- what?

800
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:24,322
It went pfew and blew up.

801
01:15:24,622 --> 01:15:27,822
all the spark, everything
went flying all over the place.

802
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,922
It formed the space.

803
01:15:30,222 --> 01:15:32,622
It was just gas,
it was floating around.

804
01:15:32,922 --> 01:15:33,922
the Earth was?

805
01:15:34,222 --> 01:15:36,422
Yeah. The Earth was really gas.

806
01:15:36,422 --> 01:15:39,722
And and the Sun formed
and it was so hot that

807
01:15:40,022 --> 01:15:44,422
that the Earth just formed into one hard big ball ...

808
01:15:44,822 --> 01:15:47,422
of ocean. Nothing but ocean.

809
01:15:48,022 --> 01:15:49,622
So, there are sea animals.

810
01:15:49,922 --> 01:15:52,322
And under the water,
volcano went pfew!

811
01:15:54,422 --> 01:15:56,622
And the hot lava hit the water

812
01:15:56,922 --> 01:15:59,622
and formed rock to make land.

813
01:16:11,622 --> 01:16:13,922
You know how to make a collect call?

814
01:16:13,922 --> 01:16:16,922
- You dial the operator, you tell him you ...
- I know.

815
01:16:17,222 --> 01:16:19,522
Good, and call Walt and Anne.

816
01:16:19,822 --> 01:16:20,822
Why?

817
01:16:21,422 --> 01:16:24,522
Because, so they don't worry about you,
so they know where you are.

818
01:16:24,522 --> 01:16:26,022
What am I gonna say?

819
01:16:26,322 --> 01:16:27,622
Just tell them the truth.

820
01:16:27,622 --> 01:16:30,922
Tell them uh that you are with me
that we are going to Texas.

821
01:16:31,622 --> 01:16:33,322
They're gonna flip out.

822
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:37,322
I know.
But you can handle it. OK?

823
01:16:37,322 --> 01:16:38,922
Why can't you do it?

824
01:16:39,222 --> 01:16:41,122
I can't do it.

825
01:16:42,022 --> 01:16:43,222
Why?

826
01:16:43,222 --> 01:16:45,422
Because ... it has to be you.

827
01:16:48,822 --> 01:16:52,622
Ah ... Gee.
Why can't he do it?

828
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,522
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

829
01:17:00,522 --> 01:17:02,022
Hunter, where are you?

830
01:17:02,322 --> 01:17:04,822
You know what time it is?
I've been calling everywhere looking for you.

831
01:17:05,222 --> 01:17:06,622
Travis got a truck.

832
01:17:08,822 --> 01:17:11,022
Yeah, yeah, Hunter,
just listen to me now.

833
01:17:11,022 --> 01:17:13,122
Tell ... where are you exactly?

834
01:17:16,122 --> 01:17:17,322
San Bernardino?

835
01:17:17,622 --> 01:17:20,622
Hunter, what do you mean
you are in San Bernardino?

836
01:17:20,622 --> 01:17:21,722
- Let me talk to him!
- Wait!

837
01:17:21,722 --> 01:17:23,322
- How do you ...
- Let me talk to him.

838
01:17:23,322 --> 01:17:24,222
All right, all right.

839
01:17:25,422 --> 01:17:28,022
Hunter, are you all right?

840
01:17:28,722 --> 01:17:29,722
Yeah.

841
01:17:29,722 --> 01:17:31,222
What are you doing?

842
01:17:31,722 --> 01:17:33,222
Going to find Mom.

843
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:35,222
With Travis?

844
01:17:37,722 --> 01:17:39,322
Why are you going?

845
01:17:41,822 --> 01:17:45,522
Tell me where you are, Hunter,
just tell me where you are.

846
01:17:47,322 --> 01:17:49,122
What's the name of it?

847
01:17:50,822 --> 01:17:52,622
Oh, my God.

848
01:17:53,222 --> 01:17:57,022
Hunter, you tell Travis
to turn around

849
01:17:57,322 --> 01:17:59,822
and come back here right now.

850
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:01,722
Do you understand me?

851
01:18:02,522 --> 01:18:03,722
Let me talk to him.

852
01:18:05,022 --> 01:18:06,422
What should I do?

853
01:18:07,322 --> 01:18:09,022
Just, hang up.

854
01:18:11,622 --> 01:18:13,522
Bye, Mom. Got to go now.

855
01:18:16,222 --> 01:18:19,622
Hunter? Hunter!

856
01:18:36,222 --> 01:18:37,222
Did they flip out?

857
01:18:37,522 --> 01:18:38,722
Yeah, she did.

858
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:41,322
You are not sorry you came, are you?

859
01:18:41,322 --> 01:18:42,422
No.

860
01:18:42,922 --> 01:18:45,122
Well, you can go back to them
anytime you want.

861
01:18:45,422 --> 01:18:46,422
You just tell me, OK?

862
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,122
I don't want to go back.

863
01:18:49,222 --> 01:18:51,722
I know.
But just in case you change your mind .

864
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:39,022
I am so used to calling her Mom.

865
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:42,422
Anne?

866
01:19:49,022 --> 01:19:51,222
She sounded so sad.

867
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,322
I know.

868
01:19:59,222 --> 01:20:01,622
What do you think Mom will look like now?

869
01:20:06,222 --> 01:20:07,522
I don't know.

870
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:12,122
Do you remember her?

871
01:20:13,122 --> 01:20:16,722
Not really.
Only from that little movie we saw.

872
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:27,322
You look happy then.

873
01:20:29,022 --> 01:20:30,022
Yeah.

874
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:37,522
You keep that.

875
01:20:55,122 --> 01:20:56,022
Night.

876
01:20:58,022 --> 01:20:58,922
Night.

877
01:21:37,122 --> 01:21:41,422
Dad, if a guy put a baby down,

878
01:21:41,722 --> 01:21:44,122
traveled at the speed of light for an hour.

879
01:21:44,522 --> 01:21:47,122
If he traveled at the speed of light,

880
01:21:47,122 --> 01:21:49,722
he would ... he would come back in an hour,

881
01:21:50,022 --> 01:21:51,922
he would be an hour older.

882
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:54,522
But the little baby would be a very old man.

883
01:21:56,422 --> 01:21:57,822
Oh yeah?

884
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,922
Well, how long will it take him
to get to Houston?

885
01:22:02,722 --> 01:22:08,522
Uh ... if if they were to travel ...
I'd say about three seconds.

886
01:22:09,622 --> 01:22:12,122
Over, I didn't get that last part.

887
01:22:13,822 --> 01:22:16,222
It would take them three seconds

888
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:17,922
to get from California to Houston

889
01:22:18,622 --> 01:22:20,322
on light speed.

890
01:22:28,822 --> 01:22:31,522
- This is Houston?
- Yep.

891
01:22:31,522 --> 01:22:34,422
How are we gonna find her
in a big city like this?

892
01:22:34,722 --> 01:22:37,322
- I know where she'll be.
- Where?

893
01:22:37,322 --> 01:22:41,122
A bank. She's gonna deposit some money
at a certain bank today.

894
01:22:44,122 --> 01:22:48,522
This is a bank?
What kind of bank is this?

895
01:22:49,022 --> 01:22:50,322
Looks like a drive-in.

896
01:22:50,622 --> 01:22:52,822
I've never seen a bank like that.

897
01:22:53,722 --> 01:22:55,122
Me neither.

898
01:22:55,922 --> 01:22:59,222
There're so many cars,
we'll never find her.

899
01:22:59,222 --> 01:23:01,322
Oh yeah, we will.
come on.

900
01:23:01,622 --> 01:23:04,422
We will split up,
and then we cover more ground, OK?

901
01:23:05,222 --> 01:23:07,322
Yeah, we could use the walkie-talkies.

902
01:23:07,622 --> 01:23:09,422
Hey, now you're going!

903
01:23:09,722 --> 01:23:12,022
- I will let you out there.
- OK.

904
01:23:18,722 --> 01:23:20,822
Can you hear me, Dad? Over.

905
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:22,622
Loud and clear.

906
01:23:24,422 --> 01:23:25,622
Good!

907
01:23:49,622 --> 01:23:51,922
Hunter in position one,
over.

908
01:23:52,222 --> 01:23:55,722
Travis in position two.
We got it covered.

909
01:23:55,722 --> 01:23:58,422
I told you these weren't toys. Over.

910
01:23:59,022 --> 01:24:00,622
Ten-four, over and out.

911
01:25:35,822 --> 01:25:38,122
Dad, she's just leaving the bank!

912
01:25:38,422 --> 01:25:39,622
Get over here!

913
01:25:39,922 --> 01:25:42,722
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

914
01:25:47,322 --> 01:25:50,722
She's leaving the bank!
Get over here!

915
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:55,522
Dad!
Come on!

916
01:25:55,522 --> 01:26:00,422
Dad! Wake up!
Wake up! She's leaving.

917
01:26:00,422 --> 01:26:02,822
She's leaving the bank!

918
01:26:02,822 --> 01:26:04,222
Dad! Wake up!

919
01:26:05,222 --> 01:26:10,822
Is ... she ... where is she ...
I'm ... I'm on my way.

920
01:26:10,822 --> 01:26:12,222
Oh, no.

921
01:26:30,622 --> 01:26:32,222
She went that way!

922
01:26:32,922 --> 01:26:34,422
Which way did she go?

923
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:37,422
Sure it's her?
Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's move.

924
01:26:54,822 --> 01:26:57,822
Hunter, did ... did you really get
a good look at her or what?

925
01:26:57,822 --> 01:27:00,222
It must've been her.
I know it was her.

926
01:27:00,822 --> 01:27:03,122
Oh God, I hope we haven't lost her.

927
01:27:03,122 --> 01:27:05,022
Can't this piece of junk go faster?

928
01:27:06,622 --> 01:27:09,022
There's ten thousand cars here, Hunter.

929
01:27:09,022 --> 01:27:12,222
- How are we gonna find which one is it?
- Go faster, Dad, go faser.

930
01:27:12,522 --> 01:27:14,822
Wh-what color?
The car was red, right?

931
01:27:15,122 --> 01:27:18,022
Yeah, a little red Chevy.

932
01:27:21,822 --> 01:27:24,522
Did you see anything?
Yeah, I don't know which one it looks like, Hunter.

933
01:27:24,522 --> 01:27:26,922
You have to help me.
Can you see it?

934
01:27:26,922 --> 01:27:28,622
No, not yet.

935
01:27:30,522 --> 01:27:33,822
- I see her! I see her!
- Where? Where?

936
01:27:33,822 --> 01:27:37,822
- Over in that lane! In that lane!
- Which, which lane?

937
01:27:37,822 --> 01:27:40,922
- The right one!
- All right, all right. Settle down, I see it.

938
01:27:44,722 --> 01:27:48,422
Is that her? Look, see if it's her?
Can you tell?

939
01:27:49,022 --> 01:27:50,922
I ... can't tell.

940
01:27:51,622 --> 01:27:53,722
Wait a minute!
There's two red cars now.

941
01:27:54,022 --> 01:27:55,222
Which one is it?

942
01:27:56,422 --> 01:27:58,822
- Huh?
- Uh ... the right, the left one.

943
01:27:59,122 --> 01:28:00,622
- You sure?
- Yeah, the left one.

944
01:28:07,022 --> 01:28:09,422
- You sure this is the one now?
- Yeah.

945
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:16,622
I hope you are right, Hunter.

946
01:28:16,622 --> 01:28:19,722
We're following the wrong car,
we're gonna have to wait a whole other month!

947
01:28:19,722 --> 01:28:21,022
I will be eight then.

948
01:28:21,422 --> 01:28:22,422
You will be what?

949
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:23,822
I will be eight then.

950
01:28:29,222 --> 01:28:31,322
Let's get closer.
We could wave.

951
01:28:31,622 --> 01:28:33,122
No, no, no.

952
01:28:33,122 --> 01:28:35,722
We don't want to get too close.
We might scare her.

953
01:28:35,722 --> 01:28:37,322
She'd have a wreck or something.

954
01:28:38,922 --> 01:28:42,222
- OK.
- OK, I guess so.

955
01:28:52,222 --> 01:28:54,922
Well, I wonder where she's going.

956
01:28:55,322 --> 01:28:58,022
Maybe to work.
What do you think?

957
01:28:58,422 --> 01:28:59,822
Yeah, could be.

958
01:30:08,922 --> 01:30:10,622
Looks like a girl's car to me.

959
01:30:11,222 --> 01:30:12,822
Could it be hers?

960
01:30:14,922 --> 01:30:17,722
Could be. Get in the truck.
I'll tell you my plan.

961
01:30:17,722 --> 01:30:18,622
OK.

962
01:30:26,622 --> 01:30:29,822
Roll the windows up, lock the doors.
And if anybody talks to you,

963
01:30:29,822 --> 01:30:33,522
you tell him your dad is inside,
and he will be right back.

964
01:30:33,522 --> 01:30:34,422
- OK?
- OK.

965
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:36,122
- You OK?
- Yep!

966
01:31:02,322 --> 01:31:07,222
Sergeant Jojo, call me in booth 22.
Sergeant Jojo, booth 22.

967
01:31:09,722 --> 01:31:12,622
The girls here spent so much time with a guy,

968
01:31:12,622 --> 01:31:14,222
that most of them live alone.

969
01:31:14,222 --> 01:31:16,122
Tell me they live alone in a city like this.

970
01:31:16,422 --> 01:31:17,722
A lot of violent things happen here.

971
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:22,022
Stuff like rape, like murder ... especially from the police force.

972
01:31:38,042 --> 01:31:41,642
Nurse Bibs, you are needed in booth 7.
Nurse Bibs, booth 7.

973
01:31:51,842 --> 01:31:54,342
- Again?
- Lots of patients out there ...

974
01:31:58,342 --> 01:31:59,642
Let's hear some rock&roll.

975
01:31:59,642 --> 01:32:01,442
How is it going?

976
01:32:20,742 --> 01:32:21,942
Sir?

977
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:26,142
Sir, you are in the wrong place.

978
01:32:27,442 --> 01:32:28,542
It's too early,

979
01:32:28,842 --> 01:32:30,242
All the girls are downstairs.

980
01:34:28,342 --> 01:34:29,642
Yeah? Who do you want?

981
01:34:29,942 --> 01:34:31,442
Yeah, I want to see a blonde girl,

982
01:34:31,742 --> 01:34:34,542
with kind of short, straight hair,
about 25 years old.

983
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:35,942
OK.

984
01:34:36,642 --> 01:34:38,742
She's coming down. Stay on the line.

985
01:34:56,542 --> 01:34:57,542
Hello, honey.

986
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:01,642
Oh, mercy.

987
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:05,942
You know, 23. I've worked 23
of the 24 booths of this place.

988
01:35:08,642 --> 01:35:10,142
Poolside will make 24.

989
01:35:11,642 --> 01:35:13,642
What can I do for you today? Mm?

990
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:16,942
I have an idea.

991
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:19,142
How about water polo?

992
01:35:20,142 --> 01:35:21,242
It will be fun.

993
01:35:25,142 --> 01:35:28,042
Uh, well, I'll tell you what.

994
01:35:28,042 --> 01:35:32,042
Why don't you just tell nurse Bibs where the pain is,
so I can find a cure.

995
01:35:32,442 --> 01:35:34,142
Why don't you look at me?

996
01:35:34,442 --> 01:35:35,842
I am looking at you!

997
01:35:36,142 --> 01:35:38,742
Yeah, but I'm over here!
Can't you see me?

998
01:35:39,042 --> 01:35:42,242
Listen, sweet heart. If I could see you,
I wouldn't be working here.

999
01:35:43,142 --> 01:35:45,142
What do you see?

1000
01:35:46,542 --> 01:35:49,442
See what you see:
nurse Bibs.

1001
01:35:50,142 --> 01:35:52,142
Nurse Bibs
and a rubber horse.

1002
01:35:53,142 --> 01:36:00,142
- Oh, oh I see. Thank you, nurse Bibs.
- Thank you.

1003
01:37:07,742 --> 01:37:09,242
Hi.

1004
01:37:13,642 --> 01:37:15,042
Are you out there?

1005
01:37:17,242 --> 01:37:21,742
Well, I see your light's still on,
so I guess you must be out there. Mmm?

1006
01:37:26,842 --> 01:37:28,842
'Cause it's OK
if you don't want to talk, you know.

1007
01:37:28,842 --> 01:37:31,042
I don't want to talk, either, sometimes.

1008
01:37:32,742 --> 01:37:34,642
I just like to stay silent.

1009
01:37:41,242 --> 01:37:42,642
Do you mind if I sit down?

1010
01:37:52,142 --> 01:37:54,642
Do you mind if I sit down?

1011
01:37:56,342 --> 01:37:57,342
No.

1012
01:38:00,842 --> 01:38:01,842
Thanks.

1013
01:38:02,742 --> 01:38:05,842
Legs got a little tired
from standing all the time.

1014
01:38:09,842 --> 01:38:11,642
Is this your first visit here?

1015
01:38:13,242 --> 01:38:14,442
Yes.

1016
01:38:17,242 --> 01:38:20,142
Well, this whole thing
must seem kind of strange to you, huh?

1017
01:38:20,842 --> 01:38:23,842
You realize that I can't see you,
even though you can see me.

1018
01:38:24,542 --> 01:38:26,542
Well that takes a little
getting used to.

1019
01:38:29,342 --> 01:38:30,442
Oh, well.

1020
01:38:30,742 --> 01:38:33,642
Am I ... am I looking at your face now?

1021
01:38:41,642 --> 01:38:44,842
Oh God, it don't matter.

1022
01:38:57,342 --> 01:39:01,342
If um ... if there's anything
you want to talk about,

1023
01:39:01,642 --> 01:39:03,642
I'll just listen, all right?

1024
01:39:05,742 --> 01:39:08,142
I'm a real good listener.

1025
01:39:20,342 --> 01:39:23,242
Is there something ... I don't know,

1026
01:39:23,242 --> 01:39:24,842
is there something
I can do for you?

1027
01:39:34,642 --> 01:39:36,442
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?

1028
01:39:39,142 --> 01:39:41,142
I'll just take off my sweater.

1029
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,842
No! No! No! Don't ...

1030
01:39:44,142 --> 01:39:45,942
Please, please leave it on!

1031
01:39:54,042 --> 01:39:55,042
I'm sorry.

1032
01:39:59,142 --> 01:40:02,042
I just don't know exactly
what it is you want.

1033
01:40:03,942 --> 01:40:05,742
I don't want anything.

1034
01:40:08,242 --> 01:40:09,942
Why did you come here, then?

1035
01:40:19,542 --> 01:40:21,342
I want to talk to you.

1036
01:40:41,742 --> 01:40:43,642
Is there something you want to tell me?

1037
01:40:47,942 --> 01:40:48,942
No.

1038
01:40:53,642 --> 01:40:56,442
You can tell me,
I can keep a secret.

1039
01:41:05,742 --> 01:41:10,342
This um ...
is that, all you do, is just talk?

1040
01:41:13,942 --> 01:41:19,442
Well ... yeah,
yeah, mostly.

1041
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:21,442
And listen.

1042
01:41:25,942 --> 01:41:27,542
What else do you do?

1043
01:41:38,142 --> 01:41:39,642
Why are you laughing?

1044
01:41:40,042 --> 01:41:41,242
I'm sorry.

1045
01:41:46,242 --> 01:41:47,542
I'm sorry.

1046
01:41:48,242 --> 01:41:50,342
So, what else do you do?

1047
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:54,342
Nothing, really.

1048
01:41:57,142 --> 01:42:00,742
Oh well, we are not allowed to see
the customers out of here.

1049
01:42:02,242 --> 01:42:06,142
When do you see them,
do you ... do you go home with them?

1050
01:42:07,942 --> 01:42:09,342
No, sir. We don't.

1051
01:42:12,142 --> 01:42:15,842
We're not allowed to have
any outside relationships with the customers.

1052
01:42:16,142 --> 01:42:18,542
Yeah, but you can really see them
if you want to, can't you?

1053
01:42:18,542 --> 01:42:21,642
I mean, you can go home with them if you want to.
All these places say that.

1054
01:42:21,642 --> 01:42:24,842
I mean, how much extra money do you make,
how much money do you make on the side?

1055
01:42:37,142 --> 01:42:38,142
I'm sorry.

1056
01:42:38,542 --> 01:42:41,542
Sir, I think you'll maybe want to
talk to one of the other girls.

1057
01:42:41,542 --> 01:42:43,242
I'll see
if I can find one for you.

1058
01:42:43,542 --> 01:42:45,242
NO! NO! NO! NO!

1059
01:42:46,042 --> 01:42:47,842
Please, please ...

1060
01:42:49,442 --> 01:42:50,942
please don't go.

1061
01:42:55,742 --> 01:42:58,642
I just don't think
I am the one you want to talk to.

1062
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:02,742
Please!

1063
01:43:03,442 --> 01:43:05,342
Please don't go. I'm sorry.

1064
01:43:15,242 --> 01:43:16,142
All right.

1065
01:43:22,542 --> 01:43:26,442
Uh ... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1066
01:43:31,242 --> 01:43:32,342
That's OK.

1067
01:43:42,742 --> 01:43:47,442
You know, I know how hard it is
to talk to strangers sometimes.

1068
01:43:52,442 --> 01:43:53,942
Just relax.

1069
01:43:55,642 --> 01:43:58,542
Relax and tell me
what's on your mind.

1070
01:44:00,242 --> 01:44:02,142
I'll listen ...

1071
01:44:04,442 --> 01:44:05,942
to you.

1072
01:44:10,342 --> 01:44:12,242
I don't mind listening.

1073
01:44:20,442 --> 01:44:22,642
I do it all the time.

1074
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:45,342
She was there, wasn't she?

1075
01:45:22,342 --> 01:45:23,742
What's that?

1076
01:45:29,742 --> 01:45:31,242
A vacant lot.

1077
01:45:31,642 --> 01:45:33,942
I bought that land when we were all together

1078
01:45:33,942 --> 01:45:35,142
with your Mom.

1079
01:45:38,642 --> 01:45:41,442
I thought we might live there someday.

1080
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:44,942
Where?

1081
01:45:45,642 --> 01:45:46,742
Paris...

1082
01:45:47,742 --> 01:45:48,742
Texas.

1083
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:50,142
Where is that?

1084
01:45:51,642 --> 01:45:53,542
It's close to the Red River.

1085
01:45:58,442 --> 01:45:59,742
Do you like it?

1086
01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:03,442
You mean we'd live on dirt?

1087
01:46:18,042 --> 01:46:20,842
Why do you drink that stuff?
It stinks!

1088
01:46:22,742 --> 01:46:24,142
Wait a minute,
where are you going?

1089
01:46:24,542 --> 01:46:25,942
To the truck.

1090
01:46:45,942 --> 01:46:47,042
Can I have another one?

1091
01:47:27,542 --> 01:47:28,942
Here, Dad.

1092
01:47:53,442 --> 01:47:56,642
It is not a place
to bring a fancy woman.

1093
01:47:58,842 --> 01:48:03,442
What would you say? If you have a fancy woman,
would you bring her in a place like this?

1094
01:48:03,742 --> 01:48:05,842
What's a fancy woman?

1095
01:48:22,242 --> 01:48:24,342
Oh ...

1096
01:48:25,342 --> 01:48:26,342
My mother,

1097
01:48:28,942 --> 01:48:30,542
not your mother,

1098
01:48:31,742 --> 01:48:33,042
but my mother,

1099
01:48:33,642 --> 01:48:36,142
was not a fancy woman.

1100
01:48:36,142 --> 01:48:37,242
She was ...

1101
01:48:43,642 --> 01:48:47,642
she never wanted to be a fancy woman,
she never even pretended to be a fancy woman.

1102
01:48:48,342 --> 01:48:50,042
Then what was she?

1103
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:52,942
She was just ... plain.

1104
01:48:55,242 --> 01:48:57,142
Just plain good.

1105
01:48:58,342 --> 01:49:00,242
She was very good.

1106
01:49:00,242 --> 01:49:01,742
But my Daddy ...

1107
01:49:04,642 --> 01:49:06,342
see, my Daddy, had uh ...

1108
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:09,242
he had this idea ...

1109
01:49:09,542 --> 01:49:13,242
he had this idea in his head
that was kind of

1110
01:49:13,742 --> 01:49:15,942
kind of, kind of sickness.

1111
01:49:17,342 --> 01:49:18,342
What idea?

1112
01:49:19,142 --> 01:49:21,342
He had this idea about her.

1113
01:49:21,342 --> 01:49:22,442
And ...

1114
01:49:24,742 --> 01:49:26,342
he looked at her,

1115
01:49:27,742 --> 01:49:29,542
but he didn't see her.

1116
01:49:32,242 --> 01:49:36,042
He, he saw this idea.

1117
01:49:39,442 --> 01:49:43,442
And he told people that
she was from Paris.

1118
01:49:45,642 --> 01:49:47,242
It was a big joke.

1119
01:49:47,542 --> 01:49:51,542
But he started telling everyone all the time,
finally it wasn't a joke anymore. He s- ...

1120
01:49:54,742 --> 01:49:56,342
He started believeing it.

1121
01:49:58,642 --> 01:50:01,442
And, he actually believed it.

1122
01:50:04,142 --> 01:50:07,642
She, oh God ...

1123
01:50:08,642 --> 01:50:10,742
she would get so embarrassed.

1124
01:50:13,142 --> 01:50:16,242
She, she was so ...

1125
01:50:19,442 --> 01:50:21,242
she was so shy.

1126
01:51:37,842 --> 01:51:39,142
Left, Dad.

1127
01:51:53,942 --> 01:51:55,742
Hunter, it's me.

1128
01:51:58,642 --> 01:52:01,742
I was afraid I'd never be able to
say the right words to you ...

1129
01:52:02,242 --> 01:52:03,442
in person.

1130
01:52:04,342 --> 01:52:08,042
So, I'm trying to do it like this.

1131
01:52:10,942 --> 01:52:13,742
When I first saw you, this time,

1132
01:52:14,842 --> 01:52:16,142
at Walt's,

1133
01:52:18,042 --> 01:52:20,842
I was hopping for all kinds of things.

1134
01:52:23,142 --> 01:52:26,442
I was hoping to show you
that I was your father.

1135
01:52:28,842 --> 01:52:30,642
You showed me I was.

1136
01:52:34,242 --> 01:52:36,442
But the biggest thing I hoped for,

1137
01:52:39,242 --> 01:52:40,742
can't come true.

1138
01:52:43,342 --> 01:52:44,842
I know that now.

1139
01:52:47,642 --> 01:52:49,442
Your belong together with your mother.

1140
01:52:51,942 --> 01:52:54,242
Your belong together with your mother.

1141
01:52:56,242 --> 01:52:58,542
It was me that tore you apart.

1142
01:52:59,342 --> 01:53:02,542
And I owe it to you
to bring you back together.

1143
01:53:04,342 --> 01:53:06,142
But I can't stay with you.

1144
01:53:06,542 --> 01:53:08,742
I can never heal up what happened.

1145
01:53:09,642 --> 01:53:12,142
That's just the way it is.

1146
01:53:13,642 --> 01:53:16,342
I can't even hardly remember
what happened.

1147
01:53:16,942 --> 01:53:18,342
It's like a gap.

1148
01:53:19,242 --> 01:53:21,842
But it left me alone in a way that

1149
01:53:22,142 --> 01:53:23,742
I haven't gotten over.

1150
01:53:24,542 --> 01:53:25,942
And right now,

1151
01:53:26,342 --> 01:53:27,442
I'm afraid.

1152
01:53:29,442 --> 01:53:32,042
I'm afraid of
walking away again.

1153
01:53:32,342 --> 01:53:34,742
I'm afraid of
what I might find.

1154
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:38,442
But I'm even more afraid of

1155
01:53:39,142 --> 01:53:41,242
not facing this fear.

1156
01:53:42,242 --> 01:53:43,842
I love you, Hunter.

1157
01:53:45,742 --> 01:53:48,142
I love you more than my life.

1158
01:53:58,942 --> 01:54:01,542
- Hey.
- Hey.

1159
01:54:07,242 --> 01:54:08,942
Can I tell you something?

1160
01:54:11,542 --> 01:54:13,942
Sure, anything you like.

1161
01:54:15,542 --> 01:54:16,942
It's kind of long.

1162
01:54:18,542 --> 01:54:20,142
I got plenty of time.

1163
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:44,442
I knew these people ...

1164
01:54:45,042 --> 01:54:46,042
What people?

1165
01:54:48,142 --> 01:54:49,642
These two people.

1166
01:54:55,142 --> 01:54:56,842
They were in love with each other.

1167
01:54:59,942 --> 01:55:01,342
The girl was ...

1168
01:55:01,842 --> 01:55:05,842
very young, about seventeen
or eighteen, I guess.

1169
01:55:07,342 --> 01:55:08,842
And the guy was ...

1170
01:55:09,342 --> 01:55:10,642
quite a bit older.

1171
01:55:12,242 --> 01:55:14,942
He was kind of ragged in, wild.

1172
01:55:16,342 --> 01:55:18,342
She was very beautiful, you know.

1173
01:55:20,842 --> 01:55:22,242
Yeah.

1174
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:26,342
And together they turned
everything into a kind of an adventure,

1175
01:55:27,742 --> 01:55:29,142
and she liked that.

1176
01:55:30,642 --> 01:55:33,842
Just an ordinary trip
down the grocery store was ...

1177
01:55:34,442 --> 01:55:35,842
full of adventure.

1178
01:55:37,842 --> 01:55:40,642
They were always laughing at stupid things.

1179
01:55:40,942 --> 01:55:42,642
He liked to make her laugh.

1180
01:55:44,242 --> 01:55:45,542
And ...

1181
01:55:47,342 --> 01:55:49,642
they didn't much care for anything else,

1182
01:55:50,342 --> 01:55:53,742
Because all they wanted to do was
be with each other.

1183
01:55:55,542 --> 01:55:57,442
They were always together.

1184
01:55:58,142 --> 01:56:00,242
Sounds like they were
very happy.

1185
01:56:02,142 --> 01:56:04,942
Yes, they were.
They were real happy.

1186
01:56:06,742 --> 01:56:09,642
And he, he loved her more than

1187
01:56:11,942 --> 01:56:13,742
he ever felt possible.

1188
01:56:16,942 --> 01:56:19,142
He couldn't stand
being away from her,

1189
01:56:19,142 --> 01:56:21,342
uh ... during the day when he went to work.

1190
01:56:26,342 --> 01:56:27,942
So, he quit.

1191
01:56:29,542 --> 01:56:31,242
Just to be home with her.

1192
01:56:32,042 --> 01:56:34,442
Then he got another job
when the money ran out,

1193
01:56:36,142 --> 01:56:37,942
then he quit again.

1194
01:56:38,542 --> 01:56:41,442
But pretty soon, she started to worry.

1195
01:56:45,642 --> 01:56:46,542
About what?

1196
01:56:46,842 --> 01:56:47,942
Money, I guess.

1197
01:56:48,342 --> 01:56:49,642
Not having enough.

1198
01:56:49,942 --> 01:56:52,142
Not knowing
when the next check was coming in.

1199
01:56:54,642 --> 01:56:57,042
Yep.
I know that feeling.

1200
01:56:57,342 --> 01:56:59,742
So he started to get kind of ...

1201
01:57:00,042 --> 01:57:01,642
torn inside.

1202
01:57:05,542 --> 01:57:06,642
How do you mean?

1203
01:57:07,942 --> 01:57:10,142
Well he knew he had to work
to support her,

1204
01:57:11,042 --> 01:57:13,042
but he couldn't stand
being away from her, either.

1205
01:57:15,842 --> 01:57:17,342
I see.

1206
01:57:17,342 --> 01:57:20,342
And the more he was away from her,
the crazier he got.

1207
01:57:21,742 --> 01:57:24,342
Except now,
he got really crazy.

1208
01:57:27,842 --> 01:57:30,642
He started imagining
all kinds of things.

1209
01:57:32,042 --> 01:57:33,042
Like what?

1210
01:57:35,442 --> 01:57:39,142
He started thinking that
she was seeing other men on the sly.

1211
01:57:40,742 --> 01:57:43,142
He'd come home from work
and accuse her of

1212
01:57:43,542 --> 01:57:45,742
spending the day
with somebody else.

1213
01:57:46,142 --> 01:57:48,342
He'd yell at her,
break things in the trailer.

1214
01:57:51,842 --> 01:57:52,942
The trailer?

1215
01:57:58,242 --> 01:57:59,342
Yes.

1216
01:58:00,242 --> 01:58:02,042
They lived in a trailer home.

1217
01:58:17,042 --> 01:58:19,742
Excuse me, sir.
But were you in to visit me the other day?

1218
01:58:21,142 --> 01:58:22,542
I don't mean pry.

1219
01:58:24,842 --> 01:58:25,942
No.

1220
01:58:27,742 --> 01:58:29,142
Oh.

1221
01:58:32,042 --> 01:58:34,242
I thought I recognized
your voice for a minute.

1222
01:58:35,442 --> 01:58:38,942
No.
Wasn't me.

1223
01:58:39,942 --> 01:58:40,742
Mm-hmm.

1224
01:58:43,642 --> 01:58:44,742
Please go on.

1225
01:58:47,942 --> 01:58:51,142
Anyway, he started to drink
real bad.

1226
01:58:52,142 --> 01:58:54,642
And he'd stay out late
to test her.

1227
01:58:56,842 --> 01:58:58,742
What do you mean
"test her"?

1228
01:58:59,742 --> 01:59:01,542
To see if she'd get jealous.

1229
01:59:02,942 --> 01:59:05,442
Ha.
Mm-hmm.

1230
01:59:07,642 --> 01:59:10,942
He wanted her to get jealous,
but she didn't.

1231
01:59:11,242 --> 01:59:12,742
She just worried about him,

1232
01:59:13,742 --> 01:59:15,442
but that got him even madder.

1233
01:59:17,442 --> 01:59:18,342
Why?

1234
01:59:19,742 --> 01:59:20,742
Because ...

1235
01:59:22,142 --> 01:59:25,342
he thought if she never got jealous of him,
she didn't really care about him.

1236
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:29,842
Jealousy was a sign
of her love for him.

1237
01:59:30,742 --> 01:59:32,342
And then one night,

1238
01:59:33,342 --> 01:59:36,542
one night, she told him
she was pregnant.

1239
01:59:37,342 --> 01:59:39,842
She was about three
or fourth month pregnant,

1240
01:59:40,142 --> 01:59:41,842
and he didn't even know.

1241
01:59:42,442 --> 01:59:44,642
And then suddenly everything changed.

1242
01:59:45,642 --> 01:59:48,642
He stopped drinking,
he got a steady job.

1243
01:59:49,542 --> 01:59:51,642
He was convinced
that she love him now,

1244
01:59:51,642 --> 01:59:53,442
because she was carrying his child.

1245
01:59:54,442 --> 01:59:58,042
And he was going to dedicated
himself to making a home for her.

1246
01:59:59,242 --> 02:00:01,442
But funny thing started to happen.

1247
02:00:01,442 --> 02:00:02,742
What?

1248
02:00:03,442 --> 02:00:05,742
He didn't even notice at first.

1249
02:00:06,042 --> 02:00:07,942
She started to change.

1250
02:00:08,642 --> 02:00:12,642
On the day the baby was born,
she began to get irritated with everything around her.

1251
02:00:13,242 --> 02:00:14,842
She got mad at everything.

1252
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:18,942
Even the baby
seemed to be an injustice to her.

1253
02:00:19,542 --> 02:00:22,042
He kept trying
to make everything all right for her.

1254
02:00:22,442 --> 02:00:23,942
Buy her things.

1255
02:00:23,942 --> 02:00:25,942
Take her out to dinner
once a week.

1256
02:00:26,642 --> 02:00:28,742
But nothing seemed
to satisfy her.

1257
02:00:29,442 --> 02:00:30,642
For two years,

1258
02:00:30,942 --> 02:00:34,942
He struggled to put them back together like
they were when they first met.

1259
02:00:36,342 --> 02:00:40,042
Finally, he knew
that it was never gonna work out.

1260
02:00:42,042 --> 02:00:43,642
So, he hit the bottle again.

1261
02:00:44,142 --> 02:00:46,242
But this time,
it got mean.

1262
02:00:47,242 --> 02:00:49,342
This time when he came home late at night,

1263
02:00:49,642 --> 02:00:52,242
she wasn't worried about him,
or jealous,

1264
02:00:52,942 --> 02:00:55,042
she was just enraged.

1265
02:00:56,542 --> 02:00:58,842
She accused him of holding her captive,

1266
02:00:59,142 --> 02:01:00,942
by making her have a baby.

1267
02:01:02,842 --> 02:01:05,142
She told him
that she dreamed about escaping.

1268
02:01:05,842 --> 02:01:08,442
That was all she dreamed about:
escape.

1269
02:01:09,642 --> 02:01:12,942
She saw herself at night,
running naked down a highway.

1270
02:01:13,342 --> 02:01:15,142
Running across fields,

1271
02:01:15,442 --> 02:01:17,142
running down river beds,

1272
02:01:17,442 --> 02:01:18,742
always running.

1273
02:01:19,142 --> 02:01:21,842
And always,
just as she was about to get away,

1274
02:01:21,842 --> 02:01:23,142
he'd be there.

1275
02:01:23,542 --> 02:01:25,242
He would stop her somehow.

1276
02:01:26,942 --> 02:01:28,842
He would just appeare and stop her.

1277
02:01:32,042 --> 02:01:35,542
And when she told him these dreams,
he believed them.

1278
02:01:36,442 --> 02:01:38,042
He knew she had to be stopped,

1279
02:01:38,042 --> 02:01:40,042
or she'd leave him forever.

1280
02:01:40,542 --> 02:01:43,042
So he tied a cowbell to her ankle,

1281
02:01:43,042 --> 02:01:46,242
so he could hear it at night
if she tried to get out bed.

1282
02:01:46,942 --> 02:01:50,542
But she learned how to muffle
the bell by stucking a sock into it

1283
02:01:50,842 --> 02:01:53,242
and inched her away out bed

1284
02:01:53,742 --> 02:01:55,242
and into the night.

1285
02:01:56,642 --> 02:01:58,542
He caught her one night,
when the sock fell out

1286
02:01:58,842 --> 02:02:00,842
and he heard her trying to
run out to the highway.

1287
02:02:01,242 --> 02:02:05,242
He caught her, dragged her back to the trailer and tied her to the stove

1288
02:02:05,442 --> 02:02:06,742
with his belt.

1289
02:02:08,442 --> 02:02:09,842
He just left her there,

1290
02:02:10,342 --> 02:02:11,742
he went back to bed

1291
02:02:13,242 --> 02:02:15,742
and lay there and listening to her scream.

1292
02:02:16,942 --> 02:02:19,042
And he listened to his son scream.

1293
02:02:21,142 --> 02:02:25,542
He was surprised at himself because
he didn't feel anything anymore.

1294
02:02:27,742 --> 02:02:30,342
All he wanted to do was sleep.

1295
02:02:32,542 --> 02:02:36,342
And for the first time,
he wished he were far away.

1296
02:02:40,142 --> 02:02:42,442
Lost in a deep, vast country

1297
02:02:42,742 --> 02:02:44,242
where nobody knew him.

1298
02:02:44,842 --> 02:02:46,442
Somewhere without language

1299
02:02:47,742 --> 02:02:48,942
or streets.

1300
02:02:50,342 --> 02:02:52,942
And he dreamed about this place
without knowing its name.

1301
02:02:54,142 --> 02:02:55,442
And when he woke up,

1302
02:02:55,942 --> 02:02:57,342
he was on fire.

1303
02:03:00,142 --> 02:03:03,042
There were blue flames
burning the sheets of his bed.

1304
02:03:04,042 --> 02:03:05,842
He ran through the flames

1305
02:03:06,742 --> 02:03:08,842
towards the only two people he loved.

1306
02:03:10,242 --> 02:03:11,642
But they were gone.

1307
02:03:14,442 --> 02:03:16,342
His arms were burning.

1308
02:03:16,342 --> 02:03:18,042
And he threw himself outside,

1309
02:03:20,042 --> 02:03:21,942
and rolled on the wet ground.

1310
02:03:24,842 --> 02:03:26,042
Then he ran.

1311
02:03:27,942 --> 02:03:29,842
He never looked back at the fire.

1312
02:03:32,642 --> 02:03:33,942
He just ran.

1313
02:03:40,442 --> 02:03:42,442
He ran until the sun came up,

1314
02:03:44,242 --> 02:03:46,042
ten he couldn't run any further.

1315
02:03:48,242 --> 02:03:50,042
And when the sun went down,

1316
02:03:50,742 --> 02:03:52,342
he ran again.

1317
02:03:58,342 --> 02:04:00,542
For five days
he ran like this ...

1318
02:04:02,642 --> 02:04:04,642
until every sign of man ...

1319
02:04:07,542 --> 02:04:08,942
had disappeared.

1320
02:04:20,542 --> 02:04:21,642
Travis.

1321
02:05:01,842 --> 02:05:03,842
If you turn the light off in there,

1322
02:05:03,842 --> 02:05:05,742
will you be able to see me?

1323
02:05:13,242 --> 02:05:14,542
I don't know.

1324
02:05:19,542 --> 02:05:21,042
I never tried.

1325
02:05:39,342 --> 02:05:44,142
- Can you see me?
- Yeah.

1326
02:05:45,842 --> 02:05:47,242
Do you recognize me?

1327
02:05:49,642 --> 02:05:51,342
Oh, Travis.

1328
02:05:58,842 --> 02:06:00,842
I brought Hunter with me.

1329
02:06:12,842 --> 02:06:14,142
Don't you want to see him?

1330
02:06:17,042 --> 02:06:18,142
Yeah.

1331
02:06:27,342 --> 02:06:31,342
I wanted to see him so bad
that I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.

1332
02:06:37,342 --> 02:06:39,742
Anne kept sending me
pictures of him,

1333
02:06:42,942 --> 02:06:44,742
until I asked her to stop.

1334
02:06:51,342 --> 02:06:52,742
I couldn't stand the ...

1335
02:06:53,942 --> 02:06:56,842
pain of seeing him
grow up and missing it.

1336
02:07:05,742 --> 02:07:08,342
Why didn't you keep him with you, Jane?

1337
02:07:11,542 --> 02:07:13,142
I couldn't, Travis.

1338
02:07:17,542 --> 02:07:20,042
I didn't have
what I knew he needed.

1339
02:07:26,842 --> 02:07:28,542
I didn't want to use him

1340
02:07:28,542 --> 02:07:30,742
to fill all my emptiness.

1341
02:07:35,642 --> 02:07:37,342
Well, he needs you now, Jane.

1342
02:07:38,142 --> 02:07:39,642
And he wants to see you.

1343
02:07:39,942 --> 02:07:41,042
He does?

1344
02:07:44,242 --> 02:07:45,342
Yes.

1345
02:07:49,942 --> 02:07:52,242
He's ... he's waiting for you.

1346
02:07:52,242 --> 02:07:53,242
Where?

1347
02:07:56,742 --> 02:07:57,842
Downtown.

1348
02:07:59,342 --> 02:08:00,542
In a hotel.

1349
02:08:02,942 --> 02:08:04,142
The Meridian.

1350
02:08:06,642 --> 02:08:08,542
Room 1520.

1351
02:08:13,542 --> 02:08:14,442
1520.

1352
02:08:16,042 --> 02:08:17,842
You are not going, are you?

1353
02:08:33,242 --> 02:08:34,942
I can't see you, Jane.

1354
02:08:37,342 --> 02:08:38,742
Don't go yet.

1355
02:08:43,042 --> 02:08:44,442
Don't go yet.

1356
02:09:02,642 --> 02:09:04,442
I ...

1357
02:09:06,942 --> 02:09:10,442
I used to make up long speeches
to you after you left.

1358
02:09:15,242 --> 02:09:17,342
I used to talk to you all the time,

1359
02:09:18,042 --> 02:09:19,442
even though I was alone.

1360
02:09:23,342 --> 02:09:25,942
I walked around for months talking to you.

1361
02:09:30,642 --> 02:09:33,242
Now, I don't know what to say.

1362
02:09:37,442 --> 02:09:40,042
It was easier
when I just imagined you.

1363
02:09:48,042 --> 02:09:50,542
I even imagined
you talking back to me.

1364
02:09:55,342 --> 02:09:57,642
We'd have long conversations,

1365
02:09:59,542 --> 02:10:01,042
the two of us.

1366
02:10:04,842 --> 02:10:07,342
It was almost like
you were there.

1367
02:10:11,442 --> 02:10:12,942
I could hear you,

1368
02:10:13,342 --> 02:10:15,042
I could see you, smell you.

1369
02:10:17,342 --> 02:10:18,942
I could hear your voice.

1370
02:10:22,242 --> 02:10:24,442
Sometimes your voice would wake me up.

1371
02:10:28,042 --> 02:10:29,542
It would wake me up
in the middle of the night,

1372
02:10:29,542 --> 02:10:31,842
just like you were there
in the room with me.

1373
02:10:39,742 --> 02:10:40,742
Then ...

1374
02:10:44,242 --> 02:10:46,242
it slowly faded.

1375
02:10:48,242 --> 02:10:50,242
I couldn't picture you anymore.

1376
02:10:54,242 --> 02:10:57,342
I tried to talk out aloud
to you like I used to,

1377
02:10:57,342 --> 02:10:59,442
but there was nothing there.

1378
02:11:02,942 --> 02:11:04,742
I couldn't hear you.

1379
02:11:10,242 --> 02:11:11,342
Then ...

1380
02:11:16,842 --> 02:11:18,042
I just gave up.

1381
02:11:24,842 --> 02:11:26,542
Everything stopped.

1382
02:11:28,642 --> 02:11:29,642
You ...

1383
02:11:34,142 --> 02:11:35,642
just disappeared.

1384
02:11:42,142 --> 02:11:43,842
Now I'm working here.

1385
02:11:49,542 --> 02:11:51,642
I hear your voice all the time.

1386
02:11:57,642 --> 02:11:59,142
Every man ...

1387
02:12:00,242 --> 02:12:01,742
has your voice.

1388
02:12:20,442 --> 02:12:21,942
I'll tell Hunter

1389
02:12:22,942 --> 02:12:24,242
that you're coming.

1390
02:12:28,342 --> 02:12:31,142
- Travis,
- What?

1391
02:12:34,542 --> 02:12:35,842
I will be there.

1392
02:12:40,742 --> 02:12:42,042
Good.

1393
02:12:47,342 --> 02:12:50,642
- Meridian Hotel?
- Yeah.

1394
02:12:54,542 --> 02:12:58,242
Room 1520.

1395
02:15:40,942 --> 02:15:42,042
Your hair,

1396
02:15:42,542 --> 02:15:43,842
it's wet.

1397
02:15:52,142 --> 02:15:53,342
Oh ...
