1
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,708
Lunchtime!

2
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:46,129
The longer you animals bark,
the colder your lunch gets.

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,090
Come on, move it out.
You too, down there!

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,258
Hey, turkey!

5
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,903
"You schmuck. Do you think
I'd be stupid enough to kill myself?"

6
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,405
Kill myself?

7
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,515
Come on!

8
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,024
Here he comes.

9
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,325
Francis, the lock.

10
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,618
Let go of the handle.

11
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,786
I don't have the handle! Open it!

12
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,163
Jake, up!

13
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,707
Come on, move! Get on!

14
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,209
Thanks, Mama.

15
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:56,842
Okay, you guys.
Let's try the victory pyramid.

16
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,011
Okay, let's go.

17
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:03,432
Come on. Put your arms up.

18
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:05,475
Smile. Good, we got it!

19
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,954
Turn that TV off.
I can't hear myself think.

20
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:27,581
Yeah, right, Dad.

21
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,132
Is the water going down, son?

22
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:40,051
- Nope.
- Is it going down now?

23
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,501
Wow, a police chase!

24
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,009
Oh, shit!

25
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:32,854
What are we doing here?

26
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:34,814
Trust in your mother, boys.

27
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:38,359
Throw her into four-wheel drive
and hold on to your hats.

28
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,075
Bummer!

29
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:32,246
Nothing exciting ever happens
around here anyway.

30
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:33,914
Who needs the Goon Docks?

31
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:38,335
Who needs this house?
I can't wait to get out of here.

32
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:41,046
Really?

33
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,217
No, I was just trying to delate
myself. No, no...

34
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,055
Dictate myself.

35
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:52,433
That's delude yourself, dummy.

36
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,309
That's what I said.

37
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,818
Thanks, Brand.

38
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:06,113
I know how you feel, wimp.

39
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:09,199
I'm sure gonna miss this place too.

40
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:16,498
Adopted wuss.

41
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:17,624
I'm no adopted wuss!

42
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:20,794
I'll kill you, Brand!

43
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:24,715
It's Mouth.

44
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,092
Hey, Mikey.

45
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,511
Yo, Mikey.

46
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,973
Hey, Mikey, seen Adrienne?

47
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:35,934
- What's going down?
- Get your foot off the table.

48
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,478
You got it. What's going down, guys?

49
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:41,106
What's the matter with you guys?

50
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:44,025
What's the matter? What is this?
A nuclear Saturday?

51
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:45,610
Come on, guys.

52
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:47,946
This is our last weekend together.

53
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:49,906
Last Goonie weekend.

54
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:52,617
We gotta be going out in style.

55
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:56,621
Cruising the coast,
sniffing some lace...

56
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,791
...downing the brews, but no!

57
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,169
The one older brother had to go
and screw it up.

58
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:08,800
Flunking your driver's test?
I don't know what to do with you.

59
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:11,136
You guys, let me in!

60
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:12,470
Jerk alert.

61
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:14,597
It's Chunk.

62
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,685
I just saw the most amazing thing
in my entire life!

63
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:20,728
First, do the Truffle Shuffle.

64
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,564
Come on!

65
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:24,190
Do it.

66
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:25,733
Come on!

67
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,068
Do it!

68
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,244
Cut it out, Mouth.

69
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:39,414
Get out.

70
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:11,153
You guys won't believe me.
I'm telling the truth.

71
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:12,238
You turd!

72
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:14,115
- Flunked your driver's test.
- Shut up.

73
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:18,369
Listen, you'll never believe me.
There was two cop cars, okay?

74
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:21,580
They were chasing this four-wheel
deal, a real neat ORV.

75
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:25,876
Bullets flying everywhere. It was
the most amazing thing I ever saw!

76
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:29,713
More amazing than when
Michael Jackson used your bathroom?

77
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:33,551
More amazing than when you saved
those old people from that fire?

78
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,429
More amazing than when you ate your
weight in Godfather's pizza?

79
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:42,226
Okay, Michael Jackson didn't come to
my house to use the bathroom.

80
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:43,561
But his sister did.

81
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:48,107
Okay, Data, don't mess this one up.

82
00:08:48,357 --> 00:08:51,527
Prepare for the Wings of Flight.

83
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,451
- Open the door!
- Mikey!

84
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:00,577
The screen door!

85
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:10,170
Hey! I bet you guys thought I
was gonna drop it, huh?

86
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,589
I know you'd expect that from Chunk.

87
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,049
- You idiot!
- Oh, my God!

88
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:19,680
Look, it's not broken.
It's perfect.

89
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:22,599
- Oh, my God!
- What?

90
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:26,061
- That's my mom's most favorite piece!
- What?

91
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:28,397
Oh, my God.

92
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:30,816
- You wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- Shut up!

93
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:31,817
Shut up, Mouth.

94
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,611
- Any of you guys ever hear of Detroit?
- No.

95
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:37,906
Certainly. It's where Motown started.

96
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:40,158
Also got the country's
highest murder rate.

97
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:43,495
That's where we move to when we
lose our house tomorrow.

98
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:46,665
Shut up. It'll never
happen. My dad'll fix it.

99
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,667
Yeah, sure he will.

100
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:51,711
If he gets his next 400 paychecks
by tomorrow.

101
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:54,464
That's wrong, Brand.
It won't happen!

102
00:09:58,218 --> 00:09:59,678
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

103
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:01,763
Hi, hi!

104
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:03,932
I see Data dropped by.

105
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:06,559
Hi, Mrs. Walsh. How are you?

106
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,688
Boys, this is Rosalita.

107
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:13,400
She'll help with the packing until
my arm's better.

108
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:19,489
Boys, Rosalita doesn't speak a word
of English...

109
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:22,158
...and I know some of you took
Spanish in school.

110
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:25,912
Well, Mrs. Walsh, I speak
perfect Spanish.

111
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:30,250
If it's any help to you, I'd be glad
to communicate with Rosalita.

112
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,211
You're a lifesaver, Clark.
Come with us, will you?

113
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:35,046
Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.

114
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:39,092
Mikey, no more potato chips.
Hello, Mikey.

115
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:40,218
It's Brand, Ma.

116
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:45,974
What?

117
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:50,978
I wonder if she'll notice.

118
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,438
That's what I said!

119
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:54,690
Of course. She notices everything.

120
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:57,151
Pants and shirts are in the second.

121
00:10:57,443 --> 00:11:01,405
Just throw them all into boxes.
Forget the suitcases.

122
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:03,115
Can you translate that?

123
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:06,786
- Certainly, Mrs. Walsh.
- That's wonderful.

124
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:21,050
Look. How's that?

125
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,261
You idiot!
You glued it on upside down!

126
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:27,515
If God meant it that way,
you'd be pissing in your faces.

127
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:28,891
Looks fine to me.

128
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:34,063
Rosalita, this is the attic.
Mr. Walsh doesn't like anyone up here.

129
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:35,815
That's why it's always open.

130
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:53,082
This is my supply closet. You'll
find brooms, dustpans, insect spray.

131
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:56,251
I'd like the house clean
when they tear it down.

132
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:58,253
Clark, can you translate?

133
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:12,434
Okay, Rosie? You're gonna be
very happy here.

134
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:16,730
Come on, Clark, we've got more to do.
You're so fluent in languages.

135
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:23,612
You're so fluent in Spanish.
That was so nice of you.

136
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:25,739
"Nice" is my middle name.

137
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:28,700
I'm taking Rosalita
to the supermarket.

138
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:30,786
I'll be back in about an hour.

139
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:36,291
Mikey, stay inside. Brand, if he has
asthma, I don't want him in the rain.

140
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,335
He should be in a plastic bubble.

141
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:40,796
I'm serious. That's not funny.

142
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:45,467
He takes one step outside, and you
are in absolutely the deepest...

143
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:46,718
Shit, Ma.

144
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,721
I don't like that language,
but that's what you'll be in.

145
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:51,932
- And you, Data...
- "Data."

146
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:54,851
- Use the back door from now on.
- All right.

147
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,479
What is that?

148
00:12:58,021 --> 00:12:59,397
Oh, shit. What?

149
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,108
What is that?

150
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,487
That is a mess.
I want it cleaned up, boys.

151
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,365
- Oh, yeah. Sure!
- You got it.

152
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:11,701
One hour and I'll be back.
Bye, baby. Rosie?

153
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:13,870
- Bye, Mrs. Walsh.
- Bye.

154
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,587
You want a breathing problem?
You got one.

155
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:25,256
What'll happen to the stuff
in the attic?

156
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:27,300
My dad's giving it back
to the museum...

157
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:31,054
...or the new assistant curly...
Curney...

158
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:32,555
- Curator.
- Wait, guys.

159
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:37,519
Maybe there's stuff up there for us
that we can keep from the oldsiders.

160
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,896
Maybe there's some rich stuff!

161
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,151
No! It's my dad's responsibility,
you guys.

162
00:13:45,443 --> 00:13:47,236
The museum's probably got a list.

163
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,530
Listen to me! That's his stuff!

164
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:59,248
Look at this. I didn't know Dad
had all this stuff up here.

165
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:03,711
- Great! Look at that! Neat!
- I love it.

166
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,464
Come on, guys!

167
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:09,008
My dad doesn't want you up here.

168
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,095
You heard what my mom said
about not wanting anybody up here.

169
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:17,725
I cannot believe you actually have
something this cool in your house.

170
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:19,227
You guys, my mom said...

171
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,646
Guys, stop. Put down
the outfit, okay?

172
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:25,441
This is great. We only have Hanukkah
decorations in our attic.

173
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:27,860
I don't care what you have in your...

174
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,075
Okay, you saw it, now let's go.

175
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,786
Come on, Mikey. It's cool!

176
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:39,705
I got you right where I want you!

177
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:44,168
It's dusty, my hay fever's acting up
and you always break something.

178
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:45,294
Mikey!

179
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:47,338
Come here and make me feel
like a woman.

180
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:50,090
Come on, give me a nice, wet,
lickery kiss.

181
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:55,012
I gotcha! Get out from there,
you're ruining the painting!

182
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:58,057
You're ruining my joke.
The painting's already cracked.

183
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,314
- Hey, Mikey?
- What?

184
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:07,107
What is all this stuff?

185
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:09,151
The museum did some...
Where'd you get this?

186
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:12,071
- Right there.
- They did a show. A retropactum.

187
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:15,824
- Retrospective.
- I said that. Don't contradict me.

188
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:20,370
It was about the history of Astoria,
and these are the rejects.

189
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:23,373
Kind of like us, the Goonies.

190
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:24,875
I'm not a reject.

191
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,753
Take that off.
You'll get me in trouble.

192
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,797
- You know how this works?
- What?

193
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:32,883
Laser beams!

194
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:38,180
Mouth, when you drop something,
put it back up...

195
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,223
What's this?

196
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,267
Wait a second.

197
00:15:58,283 --> 00:15:59,034
Chunk!

198
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:00,619
I didn't touch it.

199
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:02,245
I know. Get over here.

200
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,044
Hold this.

201
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,837
Why me, Mike?

202
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,757
Thanks for taking us up here.
There's a real big ball...

203
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,425
...and it's got this thing...

204
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,058
What are you doing?

205
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:24,184
Mike found a map.

206
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:27,645
And look. That says "1632."

207
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:29,064
Is that a year?

208
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,357
No. It's your top score
on Pole Position.

209
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:34,486
Yes, it's a year.
It's a map of our coastline.

210
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:37,572
What's all that Spanish junk
right there?

211
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,575
Mouth, you said you can translate.
Translate.

212
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:41,826
Yeah, translate it.

213
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:47,165
"Ye intruders beware.

214
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,959
Crushing death and grief...

215
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:55,632
...soaked with blood
of the trespassing thief."

216
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,925
This map is old news.

217
00:16:58,176 --> 00:17:02,555
Everybody went looking for that
when our parents were our age.

218
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:04,724
Haven't you heard of him?
What's his name?

219
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,310
The pirate guy. One-Eyed Willy.

220
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,938
One-Eyed Willy!

221
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,401
The most famous pirate in his time.
My dad told me all about him.

222
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:17,987
Dad'll do anything
to put you to sleep.

223
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:21,824
No! See, One-Eyed Willy
stole a treasure once.

224
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,911
And it was full of rubies
and emeralds...

225
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,078
And diamonds?

226
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:30,291
And diamonds. Then he loaded it
onto his ship...

227
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,627
...and sailed away into the sunset.

228
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:35,254
Until the British king found out
about it...

229
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:38,966
...and sent out his whole armada
to go after him.

230
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:42,887
It took them a couple of weeks
to catch up with Willy.

231
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:45,848
Then there was a whole big war...

232
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,477
<i>...between the armada
and Willy's ship, the Inferno.</i>

233
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:51,520
During the firefight, there were...

234
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,523
...guns and cannons bursting
here and there.

235
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:59,111
Then Willy fled, because he knew
he'd get killed if he stayed around.

236
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,572
And then he got into this cave...

237
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:04,658
...and the British blew up
the walls around him.

238
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,494
He got caved in,
and he's been there ever since.

239
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:08,746
- Forever?
- Forever.

240
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:09,955
And ever?

241
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,790
Trapped.

242
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:16,003
You sound as corny as Dad does.

243
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,131
My dad tells the truth.
Know what he said?

244
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:23,302
He said One-Eyed Willy and his bunch
were down there for years.

245
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:26,513
They were digging tunnels and caves.

246
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,682
- Setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

247
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:32,352
Setting booby traps so anybody who
tried to get in would die.

248
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:34,354
Then he killed all his men.

249
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:36,315
- Why?
- Why kill all of them?

250
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:38,233
So they wouldn't get his treasure.

251
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,152
Wait a minute.

252
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:43,697
If he killed all his men,
how did the map get out?

253
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:48,201
My dad said one of the guys must
have gotten out with the map.

254
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:52,456
- Hey, Mikey, I believe you.
- I don't believe you at all.

255
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,877
What did you break this time, Chunk?

256
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,423
Hey, you guys, look at this.

257
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,841
You ever hear of this guy?

258
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,635
Chester Copperpot.
Look what it says.

259
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:10,891
"Chester Copperpot, missing while
in pursuit of local legend.

260
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:15,478
Reclusive scavenger claims,
'I have the key...

261
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:19,065
...to One-Eyed Willy.'"

262
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:22,235
Wow, do you guys realize
what we could do?

263
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:26,698
Nobody ever found nothing.
Why would this map be in this attic...

264
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,701
...when it could be in some
safe-deposit box, right?

265
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:34,748
Right. If Chester Copperpot didn't
find it, how would we find it?

266
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,542
But what if? You guys...

267
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:42,255
...what if this map can lead
to One-Eyed Willy's rich stuff?

268
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:43,965
We wouldn't have to leave
the Goon Docks.

269
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,258
Come on, Mike.

270
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:48,928
I don't want to go on any more
of your Goonie adventures.

271
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:53,933
Where are you going?
You don't want to do this?

272
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,566
1632.

273
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:06,946
Jerk alert.

274
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:07,947
Can I help you?

275
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:11,409
Hello, little guys.
I'm Mr. Perkins, Troy's father.

276
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,953
We know Troy, he's a cheap guy.

277
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,747
My dad's not home, Mr. Perkins.

278
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,874
Is your mommy here?

279
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:22,253
No, she's down at the market buying
Pampers for all us kids.

280
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:25,715
Papers.

281
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:30,386
Well, you can give these papers to
your father to read through and sign.

282
00:20:31,053 --> 00:20:33,264
We'll be by to pick them up
in the morning.

283
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:34,682
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

284
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:41,772
- What is that?
- It's Dad's business.

285
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,107
But what is it?

286
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,693
I told you it was Dad's business.

287
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:49,155
Look at them smiling.

288
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,201
They can't wait till tomorrow
to foreclose on whatever it's called.

289
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,911
Trash the Goon Docks.

290
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:58,164
I hope they make our house
a sand trap.

291
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,416
And never get their balls out.

292
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:05,421
You know, I think they made me
lose my appetite.

293
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:36,660
Come on, before you catch a real cold.

294
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:43,250
You're sure of yourself.

295
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,377
The foreclosure is a definite.

296
00:21:49,464 --> 00:21:51,717
Oh, God, am I depressed.

297
00:21:53,343 --> 00:21:57,639
If I found One-Eyed Willy's rich
stuff, I'd pay all my dad's bills.

298
00:21:57,889 --> 00:21:59,933
Then he could sleep at night...

299
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:02,602
...instead of sitting up
figuring how we can stay.

300
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,396
- Me too.
- Me three.

301
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,106
Forget any adventures, limp lungs.

302
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:10,026
If I let you out, Mom will ground
me, and I've got a date with Andy.

303
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:13,071
You're dreaming, dude. No way.

304
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:17,242
Her mom has to drive, and then you
gotta make it with her and her mom.

305
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:19,160
- Shut up, Mouth.
- Yeah, Mouth.

306
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,037
Shut up, Data.

307
00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:24,708
Jesus!

308
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:32,173
What'll we do about that country club?
It's killing our parents.

309
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,926
If we don't do something...

310
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:37,929
...there'll be a golf course
where we're standing.

311
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,011
Brand, how far can you stretch that?

312
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:21,180
It's not that hard.

313
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,766
Get off me, Chunk.

314
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:26,477
- Get off me!
- I got you.

315
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:37,655
What are you doing?

316
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:41,075
It took his 376 lawn mowing jobs
to pay for it.

317
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:42,827
It's his favorite thing in the world.

318
00:23:43,077 --> 00:23:45,079
Now it's his flattest.
Let's go!

319
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:49,333
I'll hit you so hard, when you wake
your clothes will be out of style!

320
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:11,480
Mom. You've got to let me
out of here.

321
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:15,442
Can't you learn how to exercise
like a normal kid?

322
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:20,406
Look! You're hyperventrilicating.
Where's your brother?

323
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,199
Mom!

324
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:23,993
What's wrong with you people?

325
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:25,494
Rosalita, come here.

326
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,080
You gotta let me out of here.
Rosalita!

327
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:33,669
Rosalita, come here.
You gotta let me out of this.

328
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:41,844
- Hi, Mikey.
- Hi, Dad!

329
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:44,054
Hey, wait for me!

330
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:55,274
If you don't bring your brother home,
I'll commit Hare Krishna!

331
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:56,900
That's hara-kiri, Ma.

332
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,320
- That's exactly what I said.
- What?

333
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,741
My new tires!
They popped my new tires, the son of...

334
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:06,284
I'm gonna kill...

335
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:12,457
- My bike! My bike!
- I owe you one.

336
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:14,543
He's got my bike! I want my bike!

337
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,715
Gold Rock Beach is around
this next curve.

338
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:23,051
I have a feeling about this.

339
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:26,555
Every time you have feeling,
we get in trouble.

340
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:30,225
You're the one who always gets us
in trouble, 00-Negative.

341
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,435
I'm James Bond, 007, not 00-Negative.

342
00:25:32,686 --> 00:25:36,272
I'm hungry. When my stomach growls,
there's trouble.

343
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:37,607
Shut up, Chunk!

344
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:43,530
You made me go up this big
hill and said give me a Twinkie.

345
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:46,408
I'll be late for dinner,
and my mom'll yell at me.

346
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:50,703
She's not gonna let me eat dinner,
and she's gonna punish me!

347
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,583
Anybody got a candy bar?
A Baby Ruth?

348
00:25:58,044 --> 00:26:00,421
I can't believe it. That's it.

349
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:03,383
Those three rocks out there.
One, two, three.

350
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:21,567
Troy! You touch that mirror again,
and I'll smack you in the face.

351
00:26:23,194 --> 00:26:24,320
There's Brand.

352
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,239
Like the bike.

353
00:26:26,572 --> 00:26:27,949
What is he doing?

354
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:30,118
No wonder he can't get a license.

355
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,621
Oh, no.

356
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:42,797
Brand, can we give you
a ride somewhere?

357
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:45,549
No. Thanks anyway.

358
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:49,136
Walsh, let us give you a little ride.

359
00:26:49,762 --> 00:26:51,847
Hold on. Here we go!

360
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:54,350
- Troy!
- Let go of my arm!

361
00:26:57,895 --> 00:26:58,646
Oh, no.

362
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:06,070
Let go of my hand!

363
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:08,864
Oh, my God!

364
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:10,699
So long, sucker!

365
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:26,465
- Forget it!
- Come on!

366
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:31,595
- This better be it, Mikey.
- Shut up, Chunk.

367
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,434
Guys?

368
00:27:40,312 --> 00:27:42,731
I think I have a match.
I'm sure of it.

369
00:27:42,981 --> 00:27:47,152
The lighthouse, the rock and
the restaurant all fit the doubloon.

370
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:51,406
That must mean the rich stuff
is near the restaurant.

371
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,325
Wait a second.

372
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:57,663
Mouth, I need you to translate.
I don't understand Spanish.

373
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:00,332
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

374
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,878
- What's that?
- 10 times 10.

375
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:06,004
A hundred.

376
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:07,422
"Stretching feet...

377
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:10,384
...to nearest northern point."

378
00:28:10,634 --> 00:28:14,346
- Which way is north?
- "That's where you'll find the treat."

379
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:18,391
That's it!

380
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:19,643
- That's north.
- Near the restaurant.

381
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:26,107
One, two, three, four,
five...

382
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:29,694
...six, seven, eight, nine...

383
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:39,788
Wait a minute. Somebody's there.

384
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:47,879
Sixty and another 40 is an even 100.

385
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:50,924
Right to the restaurant.
The rich stuff is there.

386
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:53,676
I don't know about it, Mikey.

387
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:56,471
It's getting late.

388
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:59,891
That's a summer place.
Why is it open in the fall?

389
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:04,979
There's nothing to be scared of.
Two customers went inside the place.

390
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,441
What if they're not customers?
What if they're drug dealers?

391
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:10,568
Drug dealers?

392
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:16,908
Did you see their clothes? Drug
dealers don't wear polyester rags.

393
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,790
Mikey, Mikey!
That sounded like gunshots.

394
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,461
Not the kind you hear in movies,
but real ones. They're gonna kill us.

395
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:31,756
Turn off your brain.
Somebody dropped a pot.

396
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:32,924
Yeah, a pot!

397
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,137
Are you sure, Mikey?
Because if you're sure, I'm sure.

398
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:41,807
If it's not the pots,
they might try to kill us.

399
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:44,769
They're gonna kill us!

400
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:48,356
Chunk, shut up!

401
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:01,619
Soda pop! Boy, am I thirsty!

402
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:03,204
Damn it!

403
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:04,830
What's that?

404
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:06,832
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

405
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:11,378
The cook is carrying something
to the kitchen.

406
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,297
Yeah, food.

407
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:14,799
Don't let them see us.

408
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,268
ORV.

409
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:28,562
Bullet holes.

410
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:31,774
Bullet holes?!

411
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:40,407
Shut up, Chunk.

412
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:48,290
This is a summer restaurant? I bet
it hasn't been open in 10 summers.

413
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:51,460
How long you boys been at that window?

414
00:30:51,794 --> 00:30:56,048
Long enough to see you need about
400 roach motels in this place.

415
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:01,178
How am I supposed to create
with that Smithsonian piece of shit?!

416
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:13,690
Jake, these boys are customers.

417
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,829
Boys...

418
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,541
...make yourselves comfortable, huh?

419
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:37,297
She's gonna cook you something.

420
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,382
What do you want?

421
00:31:40,842 --> 00:31:42,761
- Lots of water.
- Water, water, water.

422
00:31:43,011 --> 00:31:45,680
Four waters. Is that all?

423
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,223
No.

424
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,768
I want veal scallopini.

425
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:52,687
I want a good fettucini Alfredo.

426
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:57,108
A bottle of fettucine, 1981.

427
00:31:58,818 --> 00:32:01,321
The only thing we serve is tongue.

428
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,745
You boys like tongue?

429
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,918
That's all?

430
00:32:18,254 --> 00:32:19,464
Sit down!

431
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:24,552
Are you all right, Chunk?

432
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,680
Hey, guys.

433
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:32,185
What happened to the two guys
in the polyester who came before us?

434
00:32:32,477 --> 00:32:35,229
- What happened to them?
- What is it? Spit it out.

435
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,774
You guys, if we don't
get out of here soon...

436
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:41,235
...there's gonna be
some kind of hostage crisis.

437
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:46,866
Out in the garage, ORV,
four-wheel drive...

438
00:32:47,158 --> 00:32:49,202
...bullet holes the size of matzo ba...

439
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:53,539
Chunk, I'm starting to O.D.
On all your bullshit stories.

440
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:56,292
Here's your water.

441
00:32:56,584 --> 00:32:58,711
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am.

442
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,004
I mean "ma'am."

443
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:01,881
This is supposed to be water?

444
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:04,008
It's wet, isn't it? Drink it!

445
00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:05,926
Where's the men's room, please?

446
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:07,762
- Can't you hold it?
- No.

447
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:12,058
Mikey, this ain't the kind of place
you want to go to the bathroom in.

448
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:14,018
Why not?

449
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,896
Because they might have
daddy longlegs in them.

450
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:20,149
- But I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Like dead things, Mikey.

451
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:23,402
Hey, Mikey, gotta go to the bathroom?

452
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:26,447
- Killer dead things. Big. Please.
- Lady, please!

453
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:29,366
- Downstairs, first door on the right.
- Thank you.

454
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:32,494
- Stay to the right!
- Please, Mikey, dead things.

455
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:34,204
Stay to the right!

456
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,874
I know it's to the right, thank you.

457
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:45,215
I know you're down here,
One-Eyed Willy. You've gotta be.

458
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:49,386
I can feel it, One-Eyed Willy.
I know you're down here.

459
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,184
Oh, man, that stinks.

460
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:00,439
What the hell is that?

461
00:34:18,832 --> 00:34:21,710
You're ruining it!
Look at the feast I made you.

462
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:24,421
Look at the feast I made you.
Want to eat it?

463
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:28,925
Have some. You'll get something.
You don't leave me any choice.

464
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:30,802
You don't leave me any choice!

465
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:36,725
You're just like Mom and Francis.
You never let me finish.

466
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:30,695
Why can't you stay at home?
I'm taking you out of here right now.

467
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:32,363
Let's get out of here!

468
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:35,074
Get out of here!

469
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:38,411
And stay out!

470
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,004
Kids suck.

471
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:53,009
I swear on my life, they've got it.

472
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:56,345
An It! A giant It!
They got it chained to the wall!

473
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:59,265
It came into the light
gross and distorted.

474
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:03,561
Like your brain, right?
Say goodbye.

475
00:36:03,686 --> 00:36:04,478
Hey, look at that.

476
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,566
- Ma, why'd you have to shoot him?
- He's a fed.

477
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:12,611
We could've taken him to the side
of a road and shot him in the brain.

478
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:16,240
- Bring him over here, Francis.
- Don't give me "over here."

479
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:19,034
I'm wondering, what is in the bag?

480
00:36:19,285 --> 00:36:20,870
Restaurant trash. Yeah.

481
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,789
You sure? That big? That much?

482
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:27,126
There were bullet holes
in the car this big.

483
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:30,045
Mikey, come on,
our parents are worried.

484
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:35,050
- It's dinnertime. Let's go home.
- Home? What home?

485
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:38,345
In a couple more hours
it ain't gonna be home anymore.

486
00:36:38,637 --> 00:36:41,348
Come on, guys, this is our time.

487
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,768
Our last chance to see
if there really is any rich stuff.

488
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:48,397
We've got to.

489
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,067
Get down, guys. Get down.

490
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:58,365
Oh, shit!

491
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:01,869
You guys scared me!
Almost gave me a heart attack!

492
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,206
- You look better from behind, Mouth.
- Want to see something really scary?

493
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,333
How did you get here?

494
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:12,170
We followed you guys.
We were out driving with Troy.

495
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:15,966
- Sorry about your face.
- It's okay, I was born with it.

496
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:19,303
- I'm kidding.
- Anyway, he was being a jerk.

497
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:22,639
Tilting the mirror
so he could look down my shirt.

498
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:26,226
- So I elbowed his lip.
- You elbowed his lip?

499
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:29,563
- It's locked.
- Thank God!

500
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:30,772
Wait a minute!

501
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:34,651
You know, I got some naked pictures
of your mom, taking a bath.

502
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:36,820
- Want to buy them?
- What?!

503
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,655
Real cheap.

504
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:43,577
Thanks, Chunk.

505
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,291
- Wait here. I'll get my brother.
- You'll get in trouble.

506
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:52,711
- Just don't leave, all right?
- No way I'm staying here.

507
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:59,968
Shut up! We got to get
to the lowest point of the floor.

508
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:02,512
Lowest point, nothing.
Let's go. Now!

509
00:38:04,973 --> 00:38:07,016
Oh, my God!

510
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:10,228
- No, Brandon.
- Mikey!

511
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:20,864
- Oh, my God.
- It was disgusting.

512
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:24,284
It jumped out from the bushes.
I swear it almost killed us.

513
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:28,162
Please? What if we find something?
A few more minutes won't hurt.

514
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:30,373
Come on, Mikey, we're going now.

515
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:34,335
- Brand, give them a few minutes.
- Listen to your big brother.

516
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:37,171
As long as you stay here with me.

517
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:41,718
- She knows what she's talking about.
- She's a dame!

518
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:56,983
Chunk, I hope that was your stomach.

519
00:38:58,693 --> 00:39:00,278
That's the It.

520
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,738
Sounds like Kong.

521
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:04,907
Part of it's human.

522
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,702
Come on. Want to see it?

523
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:10,871
Don't worry.
It's chained to the wall.

524
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:30,808
- I don't want to go.
- Why not? It's chained.

525
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:33,519
- Why not? It's chained.
- You wanted to go.

526
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:35,896
- Yeah, I wanted to go.
- So let's go.

527
00:39:37,648 --> 00:39:39,567
I don't want to see it.

528
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,587
- Shame, shame!
- I know your name.

529
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:03,006
Come on, Brand, slip her the tongue.

530
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:06,051
That's disgusting.
No, I can't even look.

531
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,929
Get me up, guys!

532
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:11,890
One, two, three.

533
00:40:12,432 --> 00:40:13,642
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

534
00:40:13,892 --> 00:40:17,896
Can't you smell it, guys?
One-Eyed Willy really is down here.

535
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,816
We're walking right above...

536
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:23,610
I'm gonna build one like this one.

537
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,195
Water.

538
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:28,657
- Come on, we can do it.
- No, wait a minute.

539
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,995
Right about here must've been when we
said we gotta get to the lowest spot.

540
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:37,165
What are you two talking
to each other about, Mikey?

541
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:41,670
What the hell are you doing?
You're going to lose your fist!

542
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,172
What are you doing? Give me that.

543
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:47,592
There's nothing buried there.
This is the 20th century!

544
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:50,804
- The map says there is.
- Get off it! There's nothing...

545
00:40:51,054 --> 00:40:52,889
Lookit! I got an idea.

546
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:56,893
Let's put chocolate all over the floor
and let Chunk eat through it.

547
00:40:57,143 --> 00:41:00,522
Okay, Mouth, that's all I can stand.

548
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:04,401
And I can't stand no more!
I got it! I got it! I got it!

549
00:41:06,027 --> 00:41:08,571
- I don't got it.
- You klutz.

550
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:10,740
Hope it's not a deposit bottle.

551
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,534
This is ridiculous.

552
00:41:12,826 --> 00:41:16,121
I feel like I'm babysitting,
except I'm not getting paid.

553
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,373
- Listen to that.
- What?

554
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:25,922
Sounds like my grandfather
taking a leak. Thrillsville.

555
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:27,382
No, it's deep.

556
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:31,803
Like there's a hole
or a passageway. Real deep.

557
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:33,596
Get out of the way.

558
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:36,140
Brand is being so sweet.

559
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:41,020
You're in the clouds,
and we are in a basement!

560
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:47,944
I told you!

561
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:49,779
Told you! I told you!

562
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:55,743
I can feel the air.
There's something down there.

563
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,912
It might be a treasure or something.

564
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:02,959
Hey, this is working, guys.

565
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,047
- Brand, careful!
- Are you okay?

566
00:42:08,297 --> 00:42:10,383
I told you there was a passageway.

567
00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:13,511
- It's the start of the tunnel.
- Look.

568
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:26,607
$50 bill.

569
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:28,526
$50 bill. $50 bill?

570
00:42:29,985 --> 00:42:31,112
Did he say, "$50 bill"?

571
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:33,239
$50 bills!
Hundreds of them!

572
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:38,202
We have money to save the Goon Docks!

573
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:46,919
Quiet!

574
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:49,880
They're fake. They're bogus.
They're phony.

575
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,800
I knew these people
were from the ozone.

576
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,095
You get 25 years for counterfeiting!

577
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:59,473
- I recognize these people.
- Look, it's the Fratellis.

578
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:02,309
- He was upstairs!
- The guy who tried to sing.

579
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,353
You guys never listen to me.

580
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:07,689
I said there would be trouble,
but you didn't listen.

581
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,110
You guys are crazy.
You guys are self-destructive.

582
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,488
There's a funny farm
with your names written all over it.

583
00:43:14,738 --> 00:43:16,949
But I'm getting out of here. But...

584
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:20,327
I smell ice cream.

585
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:24,831
They got Swenson's.

586
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:28,752
They got Pralines and Cream.
And they got Mississippi Mud.

587
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:31,004
And they got Chocolate Eruption!

588
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:33,882
And they got apple!

589
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:35,676
And they got grape!

590
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:39,721
They got grape and Super-Duper
Chocolate Eruption and...

591
00:43:39,971 --> 00:43:41,181
What, what?

592
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:53,819
It's a stiff!

593
00:43:57,989 --> 00:43:59,199
The door!

594
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:16,049
- Somebody's been here. Door's open.
- Shut it.

595
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:18,885
- I'm gonna leave the lights on.
- Calm down.

596
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:25,391
Pizza.

597
00:44:26,851 --> 00:44:28,394
Pepperoni.

598
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:33,191
- Ma, he's eating my pepperoni again.
- You want your pepperoni?

599
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:37,320
Let's kill each other
over the pepperoni.

600
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,365
Put that gun away now!

601
00:44:40,865 --> 00:44:42,575
You always take his side.

602
00:44:42,825 --> 00:44:43,993
That's right.

603
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:49,749
Put him back.

604
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,716
- Okay, close the door.
- We can go, guys.

605
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:03,930
Mikey? Mikey, come on.

606
00:45:05,348 --> 00:45:07,308
The fireplace is the only way out.

607
00:45:07,558 --> 00:45:10,478
- You guys will never get out that way.
- What?

608
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:16,609
It all starts here.

609
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:26,494
Guys, I'm stuck with the stiff!

610
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:31,290
Stay. Stay.

611
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,418
Guys, come here!
He's in here! Oh, shit.

612
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:36,962
- Come on, let's go.
- Faster, guys.

613
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,426
- Half the pepperoni was mine.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

614
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:45,804
Help! Help! Help! Guys!

615
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:49,016
- Come on, you idiots!
- Okay, Ma.

616
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:52,811
- I'll make sure it's safe.
- Shut up.

617
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:55,439
- Safe.
- Shut up and go.

618
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:57,066
Hurry up!

619
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:02,988
I'm not kidding! Look in the window!

620
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:12,748
I'll show you that piece that...

621
00:46:13,123 --> 00:46:15,626
He says that all the time.
Watch your head, Ma.

622
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:17,920
- I can't find Chunk.
- Where's Chunk?

623
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:22,508
- Where's Chunk?
- Chunk's up there.

624
00:46:23,383 --> 00:46:26,345
- Look at this piece over here.
- Leave it alone, Jake.

625
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:30,140
Ma, I don't want him to touch it.
I worked two hours on it...

626
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,517
- You worked one.
- Shut up!

627
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:37,564
Someone's been here. The cooler's
broken. Go check your brother.

628
00:46:37,814 --> 00:46:40,942
- It could've been a tremor, Ma.
- I'll show you a tremor.

629
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:44,154
I'll go check the brother.

630
00:46:44,446 --> 00:46:47,908
If he broke his chains, I'm not
getting any more from the zoo.

631
00:46:48,158 --> 00:46:50,368
- Ma, just don't upset yourself.
- Hurry up!

632
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,331
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

633
00:46:58,835 --> 00:47:00,212
I'm cold.

634
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:05,133
Chunk. Chunk, come here.

635
00:47:06,885 --> 00:47:08,887
What are you doing down there?

636
00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:13,683
Go get the police.

637
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:17,145
We're in serious shit here.
You gotta get the police.

638
00:47:17,395 --> 00:47:18,813
Don't worry, I can do it.

639
00:47:19,397 --> 00:47:21,274
Go, get out of here.

640
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,905
Watch it... Oh, the window.

641
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:33,411
- Did you see him, guys?
- Where's Chunk?

642
00:47:33,661 --> 00:47:36,706
- He went to get the police.
- Go, the Fratellis are there.

643
00:47:36,956 --> 00:47:38,791
He's getting the police. Move!

644
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:41,377
See, Ma?
There was nothing to worry about.

645
00:47:41,669 --> 00:47:44,714
I knew he couldn't break them chains.

646
00:47:44,964 --> 00:47:45,965
Get the body.

647
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:50,053
We've been walking forever.
How much further is it?

648
00:47:50,303 --> 00:47:51,971
Mouth, you stepped on my foot.

649
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:54,766
Now I dropped my glasses.
I can't see a thing.

650
00:47:55,016 --> 00:47:56,434
Oh, my God.

651
00:47:56,684 --> 00:47:59,103
- I found your glasses. Sorry.
- You broke them.

652
00:47:59,395 --> 00:48:01,189
You broke my glasses!

653
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:05,193
Listen, I'm the oldest,
so I'm in charge. First, we'll...

654
00:48:05,568 --> 00:48:07,445
Data, do you have a light?

655
00:48:07,737 --> 00:48:11,032
I said I was in charge.
Data, do you have a light?

656
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,495
Sure, guys. Back up, back up.

657
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:18,873
Bully Blinders!

658
00:48:19,332 --> 00:48:22,335
- All right, Data... Ow!
- Isn't that neat?

659
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:27,256
One day I was walking home with it,
and two big guys stopped me...

660
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:31,385
Who is that? Oh, Stef, that's you.
Watch out. Data!

661
00:48:31,636 --> 00:48:32,887
Come on, turn it off.

662
00:48:33,137 --> 00:48:38,100
Oh, Data. The only problem is
the batteries don't last so long.

663
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:43,189
There's a light up ahead. Maybe we
can get out that way. Let's go.

664
00:48:43,564 --> 00:48:47,318
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I like the dark. I love it.

665
00:48:47,568 --> 00:48:50,696
But I hate nature. I hate nature!

666
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:53,657
Wait a sec! Hold it!

667
00:48:53,949 --> 00:48:56,535
Stop! I'm just a kid!

668
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,291
- What seems to be the problem?
- Mister, I need a ride.

669
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:05,461
My friends and I had
a run-in with disgusting people.

670
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:09,423
You might've heard of them, the
Fratellis. We found their hideout.

671
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:14,678
Could you take me to the sheriff?
I can describe all three of them.

672
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:39,369
Will you...

673
00:49:42,664 --> 00:49:46,251
What the hell? He's only a kid.
Can't you handle a kid, even?

674
00:49:48,545 --> 00:49:50,964
- Does it work, guys?
- Yeah!

675
00:49:52,132 --> 00:49:56,803
I can't see. Mouth, your father's
a plumber. What are these pipes?

676
00:49:57,345 --> 00:49:59,890
These look like water pipes, guys.

677
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,766
Gas pipes.

678
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,646
Drainage. Maybe... Wait a minute.
Shut up for a minute!

679
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:11,234
These pipes must lead to a building
or something. A foundation.

680
00:50:11,484 --> 00:50:15,488
So maybe if we bang on them hard
enough, if we make enough noise...

681
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:52,609
How are you, Duke?

682
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,819
- Hey, Gene, how are you?
- Great.

683
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:28,811
Reverse pressure!

684
00:51:35,401 --> 00:51:36,444
Daddy!

685
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:37,653
- Let's...
- Get out of...

686
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,739
- Here!
- Like now!

687
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:43,993
Go, go, go!

688
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,513
First, we start with
the pudgy little fingers.

689
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:07,182
Then the plump little hands.

690
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:09,852
Then the fleshy arms.

691
00:52:11,812 --> 00:52:13,939
Now, tell me where your friends are.

692
00:52:14,189 --> 00:52:15,149
In the fireplace.

693
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:16,483
Don't lie to me!

694
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:20,362
Honestly. We found a map
over at Mikey's dad's place...

695
00:52:20,612 --> 00:52:23,699
...that said there was
buried treasure under here.

696
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:26,660
Don't give us none of
your bullshit stories, huh?

697
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,164
Spill your guts. Tell us everything.

698
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:31,707
Everything?

699
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,208
Everything.

700
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:37,254
Okay, I'll talk.

701
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,883
In 3rd grade,
I cheated on my history exam.

702
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:44,678
In 4th grade, I stole my uncle's
toupee and glued it on my face...

703
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,306
...when I played Moses
in my Hebrew school play.

704
00:52:47,556 --> 00:52:52,394
In 5th grade, I knocked my sister
down the stairs, and I blamed our dog.

705
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,857
Wait, I can't see a thing.
What am I stepping on?

706
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,025
Oh, brother.

707
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:02,028
Look, a lantern. Somebody must
have been here before us.

708
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,322
- Maybe they're still here.
- I hope not.

709
00:53:04,573 --> 00:53:06,074
Look at these cigarettes.

710
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:16,042
Ten minutes ago, Troy was looking down
my shirt. Who cares? It's not wrong.

711
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,587
If I'd been smart,
he'd still be looking.

712
00:53:18,837 --> 00:53:20,964
- Listen to her.
- What's wrong with her?

713
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:23,633
- Andy, it's okay.
- Is she all right?

714
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:32,392
I should've let him look at my body.
Don't I have a beautiful body?

715
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,185
You've got a great body.

716
00:53:34,436 --> 00:53:38,231
How many years do I have before I
get fat? Before my hair falls out?

717
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,358
Before I look like him?

718
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:48,992
Then my mom sent me
to a summer camp for fat kids.

719
00:53:49,242 --> 00:53:52,537
Then, once during lunch, I got nuts
and I pigged out...

720
00:53:52,787 --> 00:53:54,080
...and they kicked me out!

721
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,336
- Look at him.
- Don't touch it, guys.

722
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:04,924
This is one of your tricks,
right, One-Eyed Willy?

723
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:11,639
You must be really hiding something
to go through all this trouble.

724
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:15,101
- There's nothing to worry about.
- You don't understand!

725
00:54:15,351 --> 00:54:16,602
Don't be afraid.

726
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:23,442
He's dead for sure.
I think he's Chester Copperpot.

727
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:24,986
- Chester who?
- Who?

728
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:28,447
Don't you remember from the attic?
The news article?

729
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,158
The last guy to look
for the rich stuff...

730
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,328
...he went in,
but he never came back out.

731
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:36,622
That was back in 1935.

732
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:41,252
Oh, God. If he didn't make it out
and he was an expert, what about us?

733
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:43,004
How will we get out?

734
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:45,589
- Don't worry about it. Calm down.
- You sure?

735
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,342
- I'm positive.
- How will we get out?

736
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:50,511
We can't be sure it's him.

737
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:51,762
I know it's him.

738
00:54:52,012 --> 00:54:55,057
I bet his I.D. Is in his wallet.
Mouth, get his wallet.

739
00:54:57,726 --> 00:54:59,103
Lou Gehrig?

740
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,898
- You get it, Mikey!
- Mikey, get it.

741
00:55:09,071 --> 00:55:11,323
It is Chester Copperpot.

742
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:14,952
- Oh, God. Come on.
- You see? I told you.

743
00:55:15,244 --> 00:55:17,329
We're gonna get killed too.

744
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,373
Hey, look at this.

745
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:20,833
Candles.

746
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:27,089
- They're gonna kill us. We're dead.
- Where are you going?

747
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:29,758
- I'm setting booty traps.
- Booby traps.

748
00:55:30,008 --> 00:55:33,804
That's what I said. I'll set booby
traps in case anyone follows us...

749
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:36,348
...like the Fratellis.
We'll hear them coming.

750
00:55:36,598 --> 00:55:38,225
- Okay, hurry up.
- Good idea.

751
00:55:38,475 --> 00:55:40,644
- Where you going?
- To set booty traps.

752
00:55:40,894 --> 00:55:44,606
- You mean booby traps.
- That's what I said. Booby traps!

753
00:55:44,857 --> 00:55:46,692
God, these guys...

754
00:55:49,778 --> 00:55:54,533
Guys, look. It looks like a skeleton
of One-Eyed Willy or something.

755
00:55:54,783 --> 00:55:56,702
Give me that. Give me this thing.

756
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,086
Oh, God! There's no way out of here.

757
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,255
No, don't, don't, don't, Brandon.

758
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,676
Hey, guys, now that we've got...

759
00:56:16,555 --> 00:56:18,890
Look at this. See what I found?

760
00:56:30,402 --> 00:56:31,987
Guys, freeze. Don't move.

761
00:56:32,237 --> 00:56:35,740
Don't move. You guys,
don't move back there! Don't move!

762
00:56:35,991 --> 00:56:37,575
- What?
- Freeze!

763
00:56:41,413 --> 00:56:43,164
Run, you guys, run!

764
00:56:48,795 --> 00:56:50,672
Holy shit!

765
00:57:15,363 --> 00:57:17,031
Man, that was close.

766
00:57:17,323 --> 00:57:20,034
Wait, listen. Sounds like
somebody's down there.

767
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,044
Shut up and listen.

768
00:57:30,294 --> 00:57:32,588
- Maybe it's a way out.
- Or the Fratellis.

769
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:36,592
- Or Chunk got the police.
- Or one of Willy's booby traps.

770
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:44,100
God put that rock there for a purpose.

771
00:57:44,392 --> 00:57:47,603
I'm not so sure you should
move it or anything.

772
00:57:49,563 --> 00:57:50,773
Hello?

773
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:55,945
Bats!

774
00:58:03,369 --> 00:58:04,912
Save me! They're in my hair.

775
00:58:05,204 --> 00:58:07,456
Help! Rabies! Rabies!

776
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:12,253
Rabies! We're gonna get rabies!

777
00:58:13,546 --> 00:58:18,300
But the worst thing I ever done,
I mixed up fake puke at home...

778
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:23,138
...and I went to this movie theater,
hid the puke in my jacket...

779
00:58:23,389 --> 00:58:25,975
...climbed up to the balcony...

780
00:58:26,225 --> 00:58:29,103
...and then I made a noise like this...

781
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:40,864
And then I dumped it over the side...

782
00:58:41,532 --> 00:58:44,243
...on all the people
in the audience. Then...

783
00:58:44,493 --> 00:58:46,537
Then this was horrible.

784
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:51,291
All the people started getting sick
and throwing up on each other.

785
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:54,503
I never felt so bad in my entire life.

786
00:58:54,753 --> 00:58:56,463
I'm beginning to like him, Ma.

787
00:58:56,713 --> 00:58:58,131
Hit puree.

788
00:58:58,632 --> 00:59:00,175
No, I'm too young!

789
00:59:00,968 --> 00:59:03,679
No! I want to play the violin!

790
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:06,139
- Not my hand!
- Do I get the truth?

791
00:59:06,723 --> 00:59:09,601
Do I get the truth,
or do you get juiced?

792
00:59:11,645 --> 00:59:13,980
- What was that noise?
- Fireplace blew.

793
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:17,692
The kid's not kidding, Ma.
There's a tunnel down there.

794
00:59:19,194 --> 00:59:22,405
Watch your hair!
They're going for the hair!

795
00:59:23,782 --> 00:59:24,866
Watch your veins, Ma!

796
00:59:25,116 --> 00:59:28,954
Hey, Mikey, if you can hear me, run!

797
00:59:29,204 --> 00:59:31,331
Run! They're coming after you!

798
00:59:32,123 --> 00:59:35,835
Hey, if we keep going this
far down, we'll reach China.

799
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:38,588
Maybe I can go see
my auntie or something.

800
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:43,009
This could get dangerous, Andy.

801
00:59:43,301 --> 00:59:45,553
- You might want to hold my hand.
- Thank you.

802
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:50,016
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, neat!

803
00:59:50,266 --> 00:59:53,103
- That's beautiful.
- Look, a waterfall!

804
01:00:21,506 --> 01:00:24,842
- Wow! It's a giant piggy bank!
- We're rich!

805
01:00:25,093 --> 01:00:26,052
We found it!

806
01:00:26,302 --> 01:00:30,014
- Gold and silver all over the place!
- It's gold, we did it!

807
01:00:30,306 --> 01:00:31,516
Hold the lantern.

808
01:00:32,225 --> 01:00:34,018
Coins! Rich stuff.

809
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:36,437
What year was the map made?

810
01:00:36,687 --> 01:00:37,605
I don't know.

811
01:00:37,855 --> 01:00:42,026
Probably a couple hundred years
before President Lincoln.

812
01:00:43,027 --> 01:00:44,487
George Washington.

813
01:00:45,947 --> 01:00:50,117
- Martin Sheen.
- That's President Kennedy, you idiot!

814
01:00:50,368 --> 01:00:53,537
Well, same difference! I mean,
he played Kennedy once.

815
01:00:53,788 --> 01:00:56,374
That's smart. I'm glad
you're using your brain.

816
01:00:56,624 --> 01:00:59,877
- At least I have a brain!
- You're so stupid, Mouth.

817
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:01,712
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

818
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,924
Shut up! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

819
01:01:05,174 --> 01:01:08,427
This isn't gold. This is
a wishing well. Look.

820
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:11,514
Hey, it must be the old
Moss Garden wishing well.

821
01:01:11,764 --> 01:01:16,560
I used to believe when you threw
money in, it turned into your wish.

822
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:19,355
- I'll take two of your coins.
- That's not fair.

823
01:01:19,605 --> 01:01:24,526
- Wait, wait, wait, you can't do this.
- Why?

824
01:01:24,777 --> 01:01:27,029
Because these are
somebody else's wishes.

825
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:29,657
They're somebody else's dreams.

826
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:34,036
Yeah, but you know what?

827
01:01:34,828 --> 01:01:37,664
This one, this one right here...

828
01:01:37,956 --> 01:01:40,501
...this was my dream, my wish.

829
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:44,505
And it didn't come true.
So I'm taking it back.

830
01:01:44,797 --> 01:01:46,757
I'm taking them all back.

831
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:53,722
Come on, One-Eyed Willy, what does
this have to do with the map?

832
01:01:53,972 --> 01:01:56,266
Is this another one of your tricks?

833
01:01:56,683 --> 01:01:59,436
Maybe we should keep him alive
in case he isn't lying.

834
01:01:59,686 --> 01:02:03,190
Good idea, Jake. Put him in
with your brother.

835
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,399
Okay, Ma.

836
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,318
Come on, kid.

837
01:02:08,528 --> 01:02:11,823
- You dropped something.
- What's that, a Cracker Jack prize?

838
01:02:14,034 --> 01:02:15,827
- Shit!
- We found it on the map.

839
01:02:16,078 --> 01:02:18,413
It has to do with the treasure.

840
01:02:18,663 --> 01:02:21,083
Jake, look at the date on it.

841
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,418
This is an authentic doubloon.

842
01:02:23,668 --> 01:02:25,253
Give it to me.

843
01:02:25,504 --> 01:02:26,963
I told you so.

844
01:02:27,214 --> 01:02:32,219
See, you guys? You never believed me.
I said there was gonna be buried...

845
01:02:37,182 --> 01:02:39,851
Troy, how far you got with Andy?

846
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,686
All the way, buddy?

847
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:44,356
You guys are so immature. Grow up.

848
01:02:44,648 --> 01:02:47,150
- Come on, tell us.
- Really.

849
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,153
Put it this way:
I didn't make it with her yet.

850
01:02:50,403 --> 01:02:52,405
And I stress "yet."

851
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:57,327
What the hell?

852
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,206
- What'd you wish for?
- To make it with Andy.

853
01:03:05,543 --> 01:03:07,420
Hey, who's down there?

854
01:03:08,546 --> 01:03:10,340
Hey, guys, it's Troy!

855
01:03:12,508 --> 01:03:13,635
Sounds like Andy.

856
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:15,178
Andy!

857
01:03:16,012 --> 01:03:17,013
Is that you?

858
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:20,975
Yeah, it's me. We're stuck down here.
Please send down the bucket.

859
01:03:21,225 --> 01:03:24,103
What the hell are you doing
at the bottom of a well?

860
01:03:24,395 --> 01:03:29,317
Don't ask stupid questions! We're
stuck! Just send down the bucket!

861
01:03:30,234 --> 01:03:33,738
See, guys? Wishes do come true.

862
01:03:34,906 --> 01:03:37,074
<i>All right, my hearties, follow me!</i>

863
01:03:43,247 --> 01:03:45,333
Don't worry. I brought you more food.

864
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:47,668
Why are you locking me in here?

865
01:03:47,919 --> 01:03:50,046
- You're not too tight.
- Yes, it is.

866
01:03:50,338 --> 01:03:52,632
If you get out, I'll break your legs.

867
01:03:52,882 --> 01:03:55,092
What are you doing?

868
01:03:55,343 --> 01:03:58,054
If you sit too close to the TV,
you'll screw up your eye.

869
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,931
Jake, leave him alone!

870
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:08,898
Come on! Let me out.

871
01:04:17,907 --> 01:04:21,827
Hi, sir. My name's Lawrence.

872
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:24,705
Sometimes people call me Chunk.

873
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:37,384
Help! Let me out of here!

874
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:39,178
Who knows what we'll find.

875
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:40,637
Okay, let's go.

876
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:44,683
Whoa, look at this.
Look how deep it is down there.

877
01:04:44,933 --> 01:04:46,060
Jake, you first.

878
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,020
I ain't gonna go first.

879
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:51,356
- Go!
- Can't argue with that, Ma, all right.

880
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:53,400
Troy, throw the bucket down.

881
01:04:54,818 --> 01:04:57,654
Hey, you guys, I'm the smallest.
I want to go first.

882
01:04:57,905 --> 01:05:02,492
Get out! I'm the oldest, so I call
the shots. Andy goes first.

883
01:05:02,743 --> 01:05:04,411
Chester Copperpot.

884
01:05:04,661 --> 01:05:06,538
Chester Copperpot.

885
01:05:06,997 --> 01:05:08,290
Chester Copperpot!

886
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:10,417
Don't you see?

887
01:05:11,043 --> 01:05:15,047
Don't you realize? He was a pro!
He never made it this far.

888
01:05:15,297 --> 01:05:18,300
Look how far we've come.
We've got a chance.

889
01:05:18,759 --> 01:05:21,511
Chance at what, Mikey?
Getting killed?

890
01:05:21,762 --> 01:05:26,725
Look, if we keep going, someone's
really gonna get hurt. Maybe dead.

891
01:05:27,058 --> 01:05:28,602
We've got to get the police.

892
01:05:28,852 --> 01:05:30,437
Maybe Chunk got the police.

893
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:31,813
Maybe Chunk is dead.

894
01:05:32,063 --> 01:05:36,359
Don't say that. Never say that.
Goonies never say "die"!

895
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:41,156
I'm not a Goonie. I want to go home.

896
01:05:43,283 --> 01:05:46,119
I forgot. But still!

897
01:05:46,745 --> 01:05:50,707
Don't you realize?
The next time you see the sky...

898
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:54,002
...it'll be over another town.

899
01:05:55,003 --> 01:05:57,172
The next time we take a test...

900
01:05:58,882 --> 01:06:01,843
...it'll be in some other school.

901
01:06:03,386 --> 01:06:07,223
Our parents, they want
the best of stuff for us.

902
01:06:08,266 --> 01:06:10,602
Now they got to do
what's right for them.

903
01:06:10,852 --> 01:06:13,771
Because it's their time. Their time!

904
01:06:14,355 --> 01:06:15,315
Up there.

905
01:06:16,065 --> 01:06:20,320
Down here it's our time.
It's our time down here.

906
01:06:21,613 --> 01:06:25,742
That's all over the second
we ride up Troy's bucket.

907
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:08,743
Andy!

908
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:11,620
You Goonie!

909
01:07:12,788 --> 01:07:14,123
<i>Spread it around.</i>

910
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,752
<i>You try to make your frosting
look rugged.</i>

911
01:07:18,002 --> 01:07:19,587
Chocolate.

912
01:07:21,672 --> 01:07:24,341
Chocolate.

913
01:07:26,218 --> 01:07:29,180
Want a candy bar?
Look, I got a Baby Ruth.

914
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:30,639
Sir?

915
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:37,855
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Baby Ruth.

916
01:07:38,105 --> 01:07:39,607
I'm gonna throw it to you.

917
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:52,953
I'm sorry, sir!
I tried to give it to you.

918
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:54,621
Oh, I'm sorry!

919
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:58,709
I'm really sorry.
I'll get you a... I'll get you a...

920
01:08:19,813 --> 01:08:23,734
Jeez, mister, you're even hungrier
than I am.

921
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,574
Booby traps. It's only booby traps.
Why you being such a sissy?

922
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:32,159
Freaking kids.

923
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,752
- Kids must've cleaned him out.
- Right before they ate him.

924
01:08:43,003 --> 01:08:44,004
Stupid.

925
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:50,176
Follow them size fives.

926
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:54,139
Sloth.

927
01:08:55,890 --> 01:08:56,850
Chunk.

928
01:08:57,809 --> 01:08:59,310
Sloth.

929
01:09:00,854 --> 01:09:01,980
Chunk.

930
01:09:42,395 --> 01:09:46,190
Man, you smell like Phys. Ed.

931
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:51,112
Mouth, hold this. Translate this.

932
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:54,407
"Copper bones.

933
01:09:55,783 --> 01:09:57,702
Westward foams.

934
01:09:59,954 --> 01:10:01,122
Triple stones."

935
01:10:01,372 --> 01:10:03,207
This must be copper bones.

936
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,129
Oh, sorry.

937
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:15,928
Wow. Look at that.

938
01:10:17,304 --> 01:10:19,056
Triple stones!

939
01:10:19,557 --> 01:10:22,935
We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
We're right behind you.

940
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,729
Why couldn't I have had a sister?

941
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,649
A little sister instead
of that?

942
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:34,738
No, that's too big.
Try the middle one.

943
01:10:34,989 --> 01:10:37,116
- You guys are crazy.
- No, the middle one!

944
01:10:37,741 --> 01:10:40,119
- It fits, Mikey! It fits!
- We got it!

945
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:43,038
- We got you, One-Eyed Willy.
- Which way do we turn?

946
01:10:43,289 --> 01:10:44,790
West. Counterclockwise.

947
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:45,958
Counterclockwise.

948
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,961
Try it, Mikey. Try it. Yeah, yeah!

949
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:56,009
What the hell is that?

950
01:11:02,433 --> 01:11:04,143
It's gonna fall on us!

951
01:11:08,021 --> 01:11:10,357
It's one of Willy's tricks. Move!

952
01:11:29,584 --> 01:11:31,461
- He's gone.
- Oh, no.

953
01:11:31,712 --> 01:11:33,547
- Truly, truly gone.
- Don't be dead.

954
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:39,177
Pinchers of Peril. You guys, I've
been saved by my Pinchers of Peril.

955
01:11:39,886 --> 01:11:42,806
He's alive! He's alive!

956
01:11:47,435 --> 01:11:50,897
You guys, I'm in another room!

957
01:11:51,356 --> 01:11:54,234
Hello, sheriff? I'm at
the Lighthouse Lounge...

958
01:11:54,484 --> 01:11:57,445
...and I want to report,
well, a murder.

959
01:11:57,696 --> 01:12:01,199
Wait a minute. Just hold on here.
Is that you again, Lawrence?

960
01:12:01,658 --> 01:12:05,161
Sheriff, look, this time I'm telling
you the truth.

961
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:09,165
I'm locked inside the Fratellis'
basement with this guy.

962
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:12,502
Rocky Road?

963
01:12:13,378 --> 01:12:16,089
Like the time 50 Iranian terrorists...

964
01:12:16,339 --> 01:12:18,675
...took over the Sizzler
steak houses?

965
01:12:18,925 --> 01:12:22,387
Sloth, get back here. Hold on.
Sloth, what are you doing?

966
01:12:22,637 --> 01:12:27,225
Like the prank about creatures that
multiply when you throw water on them?

967
01:12:27,725 --> 01:12:32,397
Sloth! Sloth!
Sloth's going into the fireplace!

968
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:35,358
Lawrence?

969
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:39,570
- No, Sloth, it's just your echo.
- Echo!

970
01:12:40,113 --> 01:12:42,448
No, I'll show you!
Don't go down there!

971
01:12:42,699 --> 01:12:45,284
It's all dark down there, Sloth.

972
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:47,995
It's your echo, Sloth. Echo.

973
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,960
I gotta go to the bathroom.

974
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:56,963
Pee break. Who's got to go?

975
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:58,339
- Me.
- Me.

976
01:12:58,589 --> 01:12:59,966
- Me.
- Me.

977
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:01,509
Me.

978
01:13:02,051 --> 01:13:06,347
This is the little boys' room and
that tunnel's the little girls' room.

979
01:13:06,597 --> 01:13:07,765
Let's go.

980
01:13:09,892 --> 01:13:11,644
Brand, where you going?

981
01:13:11,894 --> 01:13:13,479
This is the men's room.

982
01:13:16,816 --> 01:13:19,068
- Where you going?
- The men's room, Mikey.

983
01:13:19,318 --> 01:13:21,487
Yeah, we're going to the men's room.

984
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:35,334
Yeah, Mikey's been through here
all right.

985
01:13:48,305 --> 01:13:50,641
Andy, this is not the time
nor the place.

986
01:13:50,933 --> 01:13:53,727
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

987
01:13:53,978 --> 01:13:55,938
Brand! Brand!

988
01:13:56,438 --> 01:13:58,649
Go see what she's ragging about,
will you?

989
01:14:12,412 --> 01:14:14,540
Brand? Hurry, I'm in here...

990
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:17,334
...with my eyes closed.

991
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,820
- Wrong way, lover-boy. It's this way.
- Thanks.

992
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:53,036
Okay, you kissed, now tell.

993
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:56,748
There's something weird.

994
01:14:57,082 --> 01:14:58,708
What? What is it?

995
01:14:59,501 --> 01:15:01,127
Does Brand wear braces?

996
01:15:03,797 --> 01:15:05,757
Why are you laughing?

997
01:15:06,049 --> 01:15:08,885
Stef, it was beautiful.

998
01:15:10,512 --> 01:15:12,472
Next time, kiss him
with your eyes open.

999
01:15:12,722 --> 01:15:15,767
It's a whole different experience.

1000
01:15:16,226 --> 01:15:18,144
Be careful. There's a hole, I think.

1001
01:15:18,395 --> 01:15:20,355
I think Brand was standing in it.

1002
01:15:20,814 --> 01:15:25,568
Ma, after we dump the kids, how do we
get out? I ain't left no trail.

1003
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:28,947
They're right around here.
I can smell their bubble gum.

1004
01:15:29,197 --> 01:15:32,992
Ma, look. Give you three guesses
who left this rope.

1005
01:15:33,618 --> 01:15:34,744
You all right?

1006
01:15:52,178 --> 01:15:54,472
What, are you crazy? They're here!

1007
01:15:55,014 --> 01:15:57,433
They're here? They're here.
They're here!

1008
01:15:58,351 --> 01:16:01,104
Quiet. Right down there.

1009
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:04,106
This way. This way! This way!

1010
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:06,108
Come on, right through here!

1011
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:10,988
Let's go, follow me. Data, come on,
don't fall behind. Let's go!

1012
01:16:16,911 --> 01:16:18,204
Come on!

1013
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:21,290
- Watch your step, Ma.
- Watch your own.

1014
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:26,712
Oh, God.

1015
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:33,886
- What is this?
- Keep going.

1016
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:36,931
- Oh, great.
- It looks like a boat mast.

1017
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:42,978
Jerk alert!

1018
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,162
Somebody's coming.

1019
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:02,289
You there, Ma?

1020
01:17:02,539 --> 01:17:03,666
Hurry up.

1021
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:08,462
- Data, hurry up!
- Don't be a fool, Data, come on!

1022
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:13,467
- I got a great idea. Slick shoes!
- Slick shoes? Are you crazy?

1023
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:21,892
Data, come on!

1024
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:24,811
Good enough. I can see
their flashlight!

1025
01:17:28,232 --> 01:17:30,567
Hi, fellas. Remember me?

1026
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:41,495
Stop or I'm gonna shoot!

1027
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:50,545
- You'll start a cave-in!
- What do you think that was?

1028
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:53,590
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1029
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:56,593
Hurry up with that flare!
It's pitch-black!

1030
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:02,557
- Do you have a match?
- No.

1031
01:18:02,807 --> 01:18:04,142
I'll light it on the lamp.

1032
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:05,977
- Cross now!
- Wait a minute!

1033
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:08,605
- Don't push, Jake!
- I'm not!

1034
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,363
Sweetheart, are you okay?

1035
01:18:16,863 --> 01:18:18,615
No.

1036
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:23,036
These are all solid. Look at this.
All solid.

1037
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:24,913
What is that?

1038
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:28,958
It's disgusting.

1039
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:35,757
Wow.

1040
01:18:36,549 --> 01:18:37,967
Gnarly.

1041
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:40,261
That's atrocious, you guys!

1042
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:43,056
Help him! Help him! Hurry up!

1043
01:18:50,605 --> 01:18:51,564
What are you doing?

1044
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:55,860
Stop playing around! They're getting
away! What's the matter with you?

1045
01:18:56,736 --> 01:19:00,448
"To move on, play the tune...

1046
01:19:00,823 --> 01:19:02,867
...as each note is said.

1047
01:19:03,493 --> 01:19:07,330
If you make too many mistakes...

1048
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:12,251
...ye will surely be...

1049
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:13,961
<i>- Be what?
...muerto."</i>

1050
01:19:15,296 --> 01:19:16,756
- What is that? Come on.
- Dead.

1051
01:19:17,006 --> 01:19:18,925
Oh, God!

1052
01:19:21,594 --> 01:19:24,263
We gotta play the bones
to get out of here?

1053
01:19:24,722 --> 01:19:26,015
Exactly.

1054
01:19:26,724 --> 01:19:29,060
- They're on the bridge.
- Hurry up!

1055
01:19:29,518 --> 01:19:34,440
- Look! There are notes on this.
- Andy, you took piano lessons.

1056
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:37,902
- I was 4 years old.
- You want to live to be 17?

1057
01:19:38,194 --> 01:19:39,487
- Hit it!
- What're you doing!

1058
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:42,698
Finding middle C. This isn't
like my mother's Steinway.

1059
01:19:42,948 --> 01:19:44,950
Do something, hurry!

1060
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:48,829
This first chord, I think, is...

1061
01:19:49,747 --> 01:19:50,873
Go on, Andy!

1062
01:19:56,921 --> 01:19:59,006
My God, it's working!
You did it!

1063
01:20:00,466 --> 01:20:04,094
- Way to go, Andy! Way to go!
- It's all coming back to me. Okay.

1064
01:20:06,138 --> 01:20:07,181
A.

1065
01:20:08,432 --> 01:20:12,144
- C sharp, D.
- Remember the lessons, play it right!

1066
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:40,255
They're coming, guys. They're
down there! They're coming out!

1067
01:20:40,547 --> 01:20:43,216
- What should I do?
- All right!

1068
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:49,097
They're coming.

1069
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:55,437
Guys, they look really pissed off!

1070
01:21:05,113 --> 01:21:07,365
- What were you thinking?
- I hit the wrong note.

1071
01:21:07,616 --> 01:21:11,202
- I'm not Liberace, you know.
- Listen, you're doing fine.

1072
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:15,206
Andy, I believe in you.
Goonies always make mistakes.

1073
01:21:15,457 --> 01:21:17,208
Don't make any more.

1074
01:21:18,418 --> 01:21:20,754
Where was I?
A, A flat.

1075
01:21:31,556 --> 01:21:34,142
Hey, you guys, they're gone!
They're not here!

1076
01:21:57,623 --> 01:22:01,836
I can't tell if it's an A sharp
or a B flat.

1077
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:05,548
If you hit the wrong note,
we'll all be flat.

1078
01:22:18,769 --> 01:22:19,854
Oh, my God!

1079
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:21,731
Let's go, you guys!

1080
01:22:27,403 --> 01:22:28,904
Oh, my God!

1081
01:22:29,864 --> 01:22:31,991
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

1082
01:22:32,867 --> 01:22:34,076
Let's go!

1083
01:22:35,202 --> 01:22:37,121
- Brand, wait!
- What?

1084
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:39,331
- What are you doing?
- The map!

1085
01:22:39,623 --> 01:22:40,833
Let's get out of here!

1086
01:22:42,209 --> 01:22:43,127
Damn it!

1087
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:34,261
Oh, shit!

1088
01:23:35,762 --> 01:23:37,347
Geronimo!

1089
01:23:45,606 --> 01:23:48,608
- Are you okay, Mouth? Andy?
- Are you okay, Stef.

1090
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:49,818
What?

1091
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:55,824
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow!

1092
01:24:10,881 --> 01:24:12,132
Oh, my God!

1093
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,801
Oh, God!

1094
01:24:15,135 --> 01:24:17,637
- Follow me.
- It's too...

1095
01:24:19,264 --> 01:24:20,432
I can't do it, Mama.

1096
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:26,855
Idiot!

1097
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:33,445
Hold on, you guys.

1098
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:36,781
The water's really shallow.

1099
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:45,707
You okay, Data?

1100
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:21,325
You really think there's a treasure?

1101
01:25:21,576 --> 01:25:23,536
Andy, this whole ship's a treasure.

1102
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:26,956
Mikey, look!

1103
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,711
Don't worry. It's just a skeleton.

1104
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:40,303
There's gotta be gold.

1105
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:44,432
Data. Data's okay.

1106
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:52,898
Data's okay.

1107
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:57,736
Data's quite tired of falling!
And Data's tired of skeletons!

1108
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,990
- Why didn't you use the stairs?
- Use the stairs!

1109
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,241
Stairs!

1110
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:06,662
The stupid guys tell me to use
the stairs when Data's falling.

1111
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:10,457
- If Data's hurt, nobody cares anymore.
- Data's okay.

1112
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:15,212
Then some guy tells me
I have stupid inventions.

1113
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:18,048
I've been spending
months and months...

1114
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:20,759
...studying on them
and inventing them. God!

1115
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,142
- Don't touch that.
- Why not? He's dead.

1116
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:30,978
- Have some respect.
- Put that down.

1117
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:32,980
How many ships were there?

1118
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:36,817
- Billions.
- Billions? Billions?!

1119
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,946
Watch where you step, all right?
Don't slip. Don't...

1120
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,580
Mouth, translate.

1121
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:54,876
Translate nothing. It's a sketch
of the cannonball chamber.

1122
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:56,086
Where's the gold?!

1123
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:59,756
Where's the gold, Mikey?!
I'm tired of these games!

1124
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,596
I set off another trap.

1125
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:13,812
Oh, God! I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Are you guys okay?

1126
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:15,313
Oh, my God!

1127
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,690
It's Willy.

1128
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,151
Break through.

1129
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:41,005
- What's up there?
- It's all right, Brand.

1130
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,299
- Just give me a second.
- Okay.

1131
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,002
I know how these guys must've died.

1132
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,639
It's Willy. One-Eyed Willy.

1133
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:42,608
Hi, Willy.

1134
01:28:44,735 --> 01:28:48,739
I'm Mike Walsh.
You've been expecting me...

1135
01:28:49,573 --> 01:28:50,866
...haven't you?

1136
01:28:51,992 --> 01:28:53,619
I made it. I beat you.

1137
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:57,331
I got here in one piece so far.

1138
01:29:08,592 --> 01:29:12,304
That's why they call you
One-Eyed Willy, One-Eyed Willy.

1139
01:29:15,349 --> 01:29:17,935
We have a lot in common, huh, Willy?

1140
01:29:20,604 --> 01:29:22,272
You know something, Willy?

1141
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:24,900
You're the first Goonie.

1142
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:35,953
Hi, guys.

1143
01:29:37,287 --> 01:29:40,415
How's it going? This is Willy.

1144
01:29:40,999 --> 01:29:42,417
One-Eyed Willy.

1145
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:44,419
Say hi, Willy.

1146
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:49,341
Those are my friends, the Goonies.

1147
01:29:51,593 --> 01:29:53,220
How long have you been there?

1148
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:56,723
Long enough, Mikey. Long enough.

1149
01:30:19,412 --> 01:30:21,832
What are you staring at?
Let's go, load up!

1150
01:30:22,082 --> 01:30:24,084
Anything that fits in your pockets.

1151
01:30:24,334 --> 01:30:25,627
Except that.

1152
01:30:26,127 --> 01:30:28,838
- Why?
- That's Willy's.

1153
01:30:30,173 --> 01:30:32,300
Save that for Willy. Anything else.

1154
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:43,269
Bye-bye, marbles.

1155
01:30:44,187 --> 01:30:46,481
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1156
01:30:46,773 --> 01:30:49,109
Hurry up! Those creeps are
still after us.

1157
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:53,238
- That's right! What will we do?
- I don't know. Who cares?

1158
01:30:54,447 --> 01:30:56,449
- I got an idea.
- What is it?

1159
01:30:56,699 --> 01:30:58,117
<i>I saw it on The Hardy Boys.</i>

1160
01:30:58,785 --> 01:31:01,454
We leave a trail of jewels
into one cave...

1161
01:31:01,788 --> 01:31:03,206
...and we hide in another.

1162
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:06,793
When the Fratellis go into that cave,
we make a run for it.

1163
01:31:07,043 --> 01:31:09,254
Now that sounds like a great idea!

1164
01:31:10,713 --> 01:31:13,800
- Outside!
- Okay, this is war!

1165
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:16,010
- Data, don't do anything!
- No!

1166
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,470
I said, outside!

1167
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:21,182
- We won't be taken alive, matey!
- What do you mean "we"?

1168
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:22,517
Get Data!

1169
01:31:22,767 --> 01:31:25,019
It's not funny! She's got a gun!

1170
01:31:25,269 --> 01:31:26,646
Come on, snap to.

1171
01:31:26,896 --> 01:31:29,398
- Oh, I love that.
- Come on!

1172
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:37,031
Sneaking up on me, huh?

1173
01:31:38,824 --> 01:31:41,035
I know what I'm doing.

1174
01:31:51,879 --> 01:31:52,838
I'm all right.

1175
01:31:53,089 --> 01:31:55,091
Data's just unhappy.

1176
01:31:56,717 --> 01:31:58,010
Pinchers of Power.

1177
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,722
- Get it off me!
- Let me help you, brother.

1178
01:32:07,311 --> 01:32:08,646
- My gun!
- That's it!

1179
01:32:08,938 --> 01:32:12,525
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Let's go!

1180
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,325
Empty your pockets!

1181
01:32:21,575 --> 01:32:24,495
Hurry up, empty your jewels! Come on!

1182
01:32:30,626 --> 01:32:34,380
You're so quiet all of a sudden.
Aren't you called Mouth?

1183
01:32:41,595 --> 01:32:43,013
Oh, my God.

1184
01:32:45,516 --> 01:32:46,934
Is that all?

1185
01:32:49,811 --> 01:32:52,481
Oh, my God.

1186
01:32:55,317 --> 01:32:56,526
You gross old witch.

1187
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:03,158
You want to play pirate?
We'll play pirate. March!

1188
01:33:03,408 --> 01:33:06,703
- Keep going, smarty.
- I can't swim with my hands tied.

1189
01:33:06,953 --> 01:33:09,122
We'll play pirates. Walk the plank!

1190
01:33:09,373 --> 01:33:11,083
Get out on that plank.

1191
01:33:11,333 --> 01:33:14,878
- Say goodbye to your little friends.
- Brand!

1192
01:33:20,342 --> 01:33:21,426
Get out of the way.

1193
01:33:25,263 --> 01:33:27,140
Two down. Who's next?

1194
01:33:33,396 --> 01:33:35,607
Ow, will you stop pushing me?!

1195
01:33:35,857 --> 01:33:39,569
- You're pulling my hair!
- You get that girl away from me.

1196
01:33:39,986 --> 01:33:41,946
Go join your friends, you weasels.

1197
01:33:42,197 --> 01:33:43,990
Hey, you guys!

1198
01:33:50,872 --> 01:33:52,999
Sloth! How'd he get out?

1199
01:33:53,249 --> 01:33:56,503
Sloth, save them!
Save them, it's Mouth and Stef!

1200
01:34:08,097 --> 01:34:11,768
- Chunk.
- No, it's Captain Chunk.

1201
01:34:12,268 --> 01:34:13,478
Give me the sword.

1202
01:34:14,729 --> 01:34:18,483
Captain Chunk says let's get the hell
out of here!

1203
01:34:38,836 --> 01:34:39,879
The rope.

1204
01:34:43,299 --> 01:34:44,508
Jump rope, Slothy.

1205
01:34:44,759 --> 01:34:48,054
- What do you mean, "jump rope"?
- You know, jump rope.

1206
01:35:11,285 --> 01:35:12,578
We're in deep shit now.

1207
01:35:12,828 --> 01:35:14,330
Oh, shit.

1208
01:35:16,707 --> 01:35:20,377
- Remember we went to the Bronx Zoo?
- Don't start that.

1209
01:35:20,628 --> 01:35:24,548
- They wanted to leave you. I said no.
- We never been to the Bronx Zoo!

1210
01:35:24,798 --> 01:35:29,887
Remember how they bought Francis a
toupee instead of fixing your teeth?

1211
01:35:30,179 --> 01:35:34,016
- I don't wear a hairpiece!
- You rotten bastard!

1212
01:35:45,861 --> 01:35:48,363
Here, grab on to the rock. Come on.

1213
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:08,592
What happened to your braces?

1214
01:36:11,803 --> 01:36:13,847
Mikey, that little...

1215
01:36:15,307 --> 01:36:16,475
Heave-ho!

1216
01:36:20,437 --> 01:36:22,939
- I won't sing no more.
- Just put us down safely!

1217
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:24,483
I won't sing anymore.

1218
01:36:24,983 --> 01:36:27,694
Hey, you guys!

1219
01:36:31,781 --> 01:36:33,366
Mama.

1220
01:36:34,201 --> 01:36:36,286
Come to Mama, baby. Come on.

1221
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:42,792
Ma...

1222
01:36:43,043 --> 01:36:45,462
...you've been bad.

1223
01:36:47,422 --> 01:36:49,591
Slothy, I may have been bad.

1224
01:36:49,841 --> 01:36:54,179
I may have kept you chained in
that room. But it was for your good.

1225
01:36:59,017 --> 01:37:00,435
Remember? I sang to you.

1226
01:37:02,979 --> 01:37:04,606
When you were a little boy.

1227
01:37:17,076 --> 01:37:18,036
Fall!

1228
01:37:19,704 --> 01:37:20,830
Break!

1229
01:37:21,581 --> 01:37:22,540
Fall!

1230
01:37:23,166 --> 01:37:24,500
I only dropped you once.

1231
01:37:25,877 --> 01:37:27,378
Well, maybe twice.

1232
01:37:30,548 --> 01:37:31,841
Put me down.

1233
01:37:40,266 --> 01:37:42,185
- I don't mind dying.
- Calm down.

1234
01:37:42,435 --> 01:37:43,686
- We'll be okay.
- Sure.

1235
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:54,447
I gotta rot with you through eternity?
I don't want to rot with you!

1236
01:38:00,328 --> 01:38:04,248
Sloth, this is the guys.
Guys, this is Sloth.

1237
01:38:05,833 --> 01:38:10,379
Brand, we can't go. We can't leave
all that gold. That's our future.

1238
01:38:10,629 --> 01:38:14,550
If we stay here, we got no future.
We'll come back for it later.

1239
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,927
- All that rich stuff.
- Come on!

1240
01:38:18,345 --> 01:38:19,889
Mama, just let us down easy.

1241
01:38:22,057 --> 01:38:24,393
Not the sword!
Don't do that, we're gonna...

1242
01:38:29,857 --> 01:38:31,108
- You all right?
- Yeah. You?

1243
01:38:31,358 --> 01:38:32,401
Yeah.

1244
01:38:34,153 --> 01:38:35,779
Will you get up?!

1245
01:38:37,448 --> 01:38:39,199
Let's go find the gold.

1246
01:38:39,575 --> 01:38:41,118
Head for the light.

1247
01:38:48,876 --> 01:38:50,961
Thank you, Mr. Willy.

1248
01:38:51,378 --> 01:38:52,796
Thank you.

1249
01:38:53,255 --> 01:38:54,882
You've made my day.

1250
01:38:55,883 --> 01:38:58,385
This is a real treat.

1251
01:39:03,515 --> 01:39:04,641
What the hell is this?

1252
01:39:05,225 --> 01:39:07,811
- Another one of those booby traps!
- Booby trap!

1253
01:39:08,854 --> 01:39:09,771
Get out of here!

1254
01:39:10,022 --> 01:39:11,648
What booby traps?

1255
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,318
Booby traps!
Didn't you see the movie?

1256
01:39:14,568 --> 01:39:16,361
Leave it. Let's get out.

1257
01:39:16,611 --> 01:39:18,196
Look, you guys, daylight.

1258
01:39:18,488 --> 01:39:21,491
There's been a cave-in before.
Maybe we can get through.

1259
01:39:21,783 --> 01:39:23,201
I can't see. Got a light?

1260
01:39:23,452 --> 01:39:25,871
I got the last candle. Mikey, get it.

1261
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,874
Is there a way out or what?

1262
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:31,460
This is a funny candle. It sparkles.

1263
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:34,004
- It's not a candle, it's dynamite!
- Dynamite!

1264
01:39:59,821 --> 01:40:01,990
Women and children first!

1265
01:40:02,615 --> 01:40:05,034
- You guys, push.
- Push.

1266
01:40:05,285 --> 01:40:06,786
What about the loot?

1267
01:40:07,036 --> 01:40:08,705
What about our lives?

1268
01:40:19,883 --> 01:40:21,759
Can you do it? Come on, hurry.

1269
01:40:23,136 --> 01:40:24,429
Go!

1270
01:40:27,348 --> 01:40:28,474
Hurry up.

1271
01:40:31,519 --> 01:40:33,688
Sloth! Help us!

1272
01:40:43,322 --> 01:40:45,324
Sloth love Chunk!

1273
01:40:45,575 --> 01:40:48,119
I love you too. You'll get crushed.

1274
01:40:50,163 --> 01:40:51,747
Sloth, help!

1275
01:40:56,002 --> 01:40:57,920
Come on, Sloth!

1276
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:38,627
Well, I'll be damned.
It's them goobers.

1277
01:41:39,169 --> 01:41:40,838
They weren't here a minute ago.

1278
01:41:41,088 --> 01:41:44,133
- But they're here now. Call Harvey.
- Yes, sir.

1279
01:41:44,383 --> 01:41:46,552
- Here!
- Over here!

1280
01:41:55,436 --> 01:41:56,687
Get the camera.

1281
01:42:02,734 --> 01:42:03,986
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1282
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:06,530
I guess we're kind of in deep sh...

1283
01:42:10,868 --> 01:42:12,744
Look, you're a mess.

1284
01:42:22,879 --> 01:42:25,882
- Look what we brought you.
- Oh, pizza!

1285
01:42:26,174 --> 01:42:29,177
- Your favorite.
- Everything's on it.

1286
01:42:29,428 --> 01:42:32,806
- We were in the tunnels.
- It's good to hear your voice.

1287
01:42:33,056 --> 01:42:34,724
- I lost my glasses.
- It's okay.

1288
01:42:34,975 --> 01:42:36,268
Can I take piano lessons?

1289
01:42:36,518 --> 01:42:38,728
- You'll get ammonia.
- It's pneumonia, Ma.

1290
01:42:38,979 --> 01:42:40,856
Get these pants off.

1291
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:43,984
Hold it right there.

1292
01:42:47,237 --> 01:42:48,280
That's great, Dad.

1293
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:50,198
Just watch this.

1294
01:43:09,092 --> 01:43:11,970
I just wanted to say thank you...

1295
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,556
...for offering to save
my life and everything.

1296
01:43:14,806 --> 01:43:17,976
- What, what, what?
- I wanted to say thank you.

1297
01:43:18,226 --> 01:43:21,020
Wow. "Thank you." A real moment.

1298
01:43:21,271 --> 01:43:24,858
Your voice is kind of nice when
your mouth isn't screwing it up.

1299
01:43:25,108 --> 01:43:26,442
Yeah, well, thanks.

1300
01:43:26,734 --> 01:43:29,988
And you know, your looks
are kind of pretty...

1301
01:43:30,947 --> 01:43:33,199
...when your face doesn't screw it up.

1302
01:43:33,449 --> 01:43:34,409
I'm just kidding.

1303
01:43:36,536 --> 01:43:37,870
Hey, Mikey.

1304
01:43:40,081 --> 01:43:43,334
You know, you're a great
little kid... Person.

1305
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,462
You keep kissing girls
the way you do...

1306
01:43:46,713 --> 01:43:48,756
...the parts of you
that don't work so good...

1307
01:43:49,006 --> 01:43:51,384
...they'll catch up
to the ones that do.

1308
01:44:04,188 --> 01:44:05,982
- What?
- Let her mother worry.

1309
01:44:11,153 --> 01:44:12,655
Oh, who needs it?

1310
01:44:14,115 --> 01:44:15,157
It's the Fratellis!

1311
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:18,869
- Thank God you're here.
- We need your help.

1312
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,625
You're all under arrest. Let's go.

1313
01:44:27,211 --> 01:44:28,170
Don't shoot him!

1314
01:44:29,547 --> 01:44:33,217
- Look out, kid.
- No! Don't shoot him!

1315
01:44:33,509 --> 01:44:37,096
Get them out of here.
You don't know what you're doing.

1316
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,139
These are the bad guys!

1317
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:41,058
Those are the bad guys!

1318
01:44:42,351 --> 01:44:45,396
Put him down, Sloth.
Put him down. It'll be all right.

1319
01:44:49,608 --> 01:44:50,609
Come on, Mama.

1320
01:44:50,859 --> 01:44:54,196
You have no idea who I am.
You want to lose your job?

1321
01:45:00,702 --> 01:45:02,830
You're gonna live with me now.

1322
01:45:04,665 --> 01:45:06,708
I'm gonna take care of you.

1323
01:45:08,669 --> 01:45:10,295
Because I love you.

1324
01:45:11,171 --> 01:45:14,716
- I love you, Chunk.
- Oh, I love you, Sloth.

1325
01:45:15,759 --> 01:45:19,346
Walsh, today's the day,
so let's get this over with.

1326
01:45:20,305 --> 01:45:21,473
Irving?

1327
01:45:22,015 --> 01:45:25,018
- I'm sorry, Irene.
- Come on, we don't have all day.

1328
01:45:25,644 --> 01:45:28,021
There's 50 houses
to tear down after yours!

1329
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:30,399
- Ease off, Brand.
- Punk!

1330
01:45:32,109 --> 01:45:34,069
Sheriff, I want you to witness this.

1331
01:45:35,362 --> 01:45:36,530
Sorry, Dad.

1332
01:45:36,988 --> 01:45:39,199
We had our hands on the future.

1333
01:45:39,449 --> 01:45:42,119
But we blew it to save our own lives.

1334
01:45:42,327 --> 01:45:43,578
Sorry.

1335
01:45:44,454 --> 01:45:47,999
That's all right. You and Brand
are safe with your mom and me.

1336
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:51,795
That makes us
the richest people in Astoria.

1337
01:45:55,799 --> 01:45:59,511
You're looking at the richest people
in Astoria. Now sign it.

1338
01:46:09,562 --> 01:46:11,773
I'm sure gonna miss being a Goonie.

1339
01:46:23,284 --> 01:46:24,953
What's she saying, Mouth?

1340
01:46:28,957 --> 01:46:30,708
- No pen.
- No pen?

1341
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:32,335
No write.

1342
01:46:34,128 --> 01:46:35,546
No sign!

1343
01:46:36,464 --> 01:46:37,924
Don't sign!

1344
01:46:43,972 --> 01:46:46,307
- What's in the bag?
- What is it?

1345
01:46:56,901 --> 01:47:00,655
Dad! It's my marble bag!
The Fratellis forgot to check it.

1346
01:47:00,905 --> 01:47:05,493
I put the jewels in it.
We don't have to leave the Goon Docks!

1347
01:47:05,743 --> 01:47:10,706
There'll be no more signing today
or ever again!

1348
01:47:13,668 --> 01:47:15,920
Are those jewels real?
How'd you find them?

1349
01:47:16,212 --> 01:47:17,630
Were your lives in danger?

1350
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,549
- The octopus was scary.
- Octopus?

1351
01:47:20,758 --> 01:47:23,511
- It was dangerous.
- Walking the plank was scariest.

1352
01:47:23,761 --> 01:47:24,845
Walking the plank?

1353
01:47:25,096 --> 01:47:28,641
- Then we found the pirate ship.
- That and the pirate's treasure.

1354
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:31,644
- We were chased by the Fratellis.
- That's enough.

1355
01:47:31,894 --> 01:47:35,189
- Telling more stories, Lawrence?
- No, this time it's for real.

1356
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:37,316
