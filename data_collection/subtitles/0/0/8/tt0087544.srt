An Ohm s tracks

17
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,967
They' re still fresh

18
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,385
An Ohm s shell

19
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,664
Amazing

20
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,934
I've never seen a perfect shell

21
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,817
Lovely sound

22
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,994
It chipped my ceramic sword

23
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,120
The villagers will be pleased

24
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:08,358
They' ll have plenty to
make into tools now

25
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,896
Wha t an eye

26
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,670
I wonder if l can carry it

27
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,631
It came free

28
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,302
It' s incredibly light

29
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,188
Mushigo Palm spores

30
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,704
So beautiful. . .

31
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,406
Though in this f orest of death,
your lungs would rot

32
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,451
in 5 minutes without a mask

33
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,504
Who is that?

34
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,912
What can it be?

35
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,319
My heart' s pounding

36
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,725
Those are gunshots

37
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,124
An insect is
a ttacking someone

38
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,401
Oh, I' m sorry !

39
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,144
Over there !

40
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,921
What a thick spore cloud

41
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,453
An Ohm!

42
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,186
That must have been its shell

43
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,062
Don' t run tha t way

44
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,199
Look this way !

45
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,273
They answered !
They' re coming

46
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,414
Who' s that?

47
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,259
Wha t a magnificent Ohm

48
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,207
Go upwind !

49
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,503
Thank you !

50
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,880
Return to the f orest. Ohm

51
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,746
This is not your world

52
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,716
Be a good boy

53
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,816
It' s blinded by rage

54
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,448
I' ve got to calm him

55
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,524
The flares stunned it

56
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,126
An insect charm

57
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,169
Awaken<i>,</i> Ohm

58
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,829
Return to the f orest

59
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,572
It' s awake

60
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,430
The Ohm' s returning to the forest

61
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,203
She tamed that Ohm with
flares and an insect charm

62
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,418
Lord Yupa !

63
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,414
Nausicaa
I hardly recognized you

64
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,115
It' s been a year and half

65
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,421
Fa ther will be glad

66
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,352
I must thank you

67
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,431
You' ve become a grea t wind-rider

68
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,496
Oh. no<i>,</i> not according to f a ther

69
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,929
Oh, of course
I' d compIetely forgotten about him

70
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,208
A fox-squirrel
I' ve never seen one

71
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,975
When a winged insect snatched him<i>,</i>
l took him f or a human child

72
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,915
l had to fire my gun

73
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,010
That' s wha t enraged the Ohm

74
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,757
He' d fainted so was
spared the poison

75
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,553
Better not touch him
Even young. they' re savage

76
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,629
Come

77
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,157
Here

78
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,359
Hey. . .

79
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,532
You' re not scared

80
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,537
You' re not scared

81
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,576
See. . . you' re not scared

82
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,476
See. . .

83
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,456
You were just frightened

84
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,762
Lord Yupa, may I have him?

85
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,757
Why certainly. . .

86
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,197
Thank you

87
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,967
Kai and Kui
Remember me?

88
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,976
A mysterious power

89
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,305
You must be tired
You ran so far

90
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,911
ls everyone well?

91
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,679
What s wrong?

92
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,586
My f a ther. . .

93
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,691
He can no longer fly

94
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,758
Jihl. . .

95
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,690
The forest poisons?

96
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,325
Yes

97
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,497
He says it' s f ate for those
living by the Sea of Decay

98
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,965
I should have come sooner

99
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,678
Oh<i>,</i> no

100
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,978
Thank you f or coming

101
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:48,417
Lord Yupa, there s something
I want to show you

102
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,485
My secret room

103
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,451
It' s a secret
l don' t want to scare them

104
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,618
I' ll tell them you're coming

105
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,890
Come soon !

106
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,860
Lord Yupa

107
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,995
Would you carry this?

108
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,367
It' s hard to fly with

109
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,681
She certainly reads the wind well

110
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,878
Not far now

111
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,751
Oh. . .
Lord Yupa

112
00:15:58,857 --> 00:15:59,585
Welcome

113
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,284
Are you in good health?

114
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,296
The waters and winds
are clear and calm

115
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,921
Lord Yupa

116
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,297
Hello all, you' re well

117
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,851
Lord Yupa

118
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,255
We' ve missed you

119
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,084
Princess, he has come

120
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,719
Wait

121
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,423
Lord Yupa

122
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,426
Old Mito, you' re hard at work

123
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,966
Tonight l' ll hear
tales of your travels

124
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,931
OK. start it

125
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,779
Seems to work

126
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,081
Yes

127
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,459
This is excellent

128
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,087
Tomorrow, we' ll send
people to get the rest

129
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,161
Come. Toeto

130
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,226
Lord Yupa
This is Toeto' s baby, born this year

131
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,601
Oh. let' s have a look

132
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,934
A fine baby

133
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,840
Reminds me of Nausicaa
as a baby

134
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,936
Please be her godf a ther

135
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,881
Name her tha t a fair wind
may f avor her

136
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,946
l will indeed

137
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,146
l' ll find her a fine name

138
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,882
Thank you

139
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,391
May she grow up
as strong as our Princess

140
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,694
She' s as strong as they come

141
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,289
But we won' t want her
playing in the Sea of Decay

142
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,162
But that' s where
l found the Ohm shell

143
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,666
Put yourself in my shoes
l' m responsible f or this castle

144
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,401
She s made me sick with worry

145
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,879
Let her play in the Sea of Decay
if she finds us Ohm shells

146
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,508
lndeed<i>,</i> her presence
there saved me

147
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,719
Saved by the girl?

148
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:47,215
This is a fine valley
Being here calms my spirits

149
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,255
How was your journey?

150
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,661
It was terrible

151
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:56,222
The Sea of Decay consumed
2 more countries to the south

152
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,799
It' s spreading all the time

153
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,999
And yet war and hunger
are everywhere

154
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,235
Nothing but bad omens

155
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,736
Why can' t they live
as you do in this valley?

156
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,950
The ocean winds protect our valley

157
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,987
The Sea of Decay
can' t reach us here

158
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,820
Wha t do you say. Yupa?

159
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,451
lsn' t it time you
settled in this valley?

160
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,029
Look at my condition

161
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,428
It would please everyone

162
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,795
Don' t bother

163
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:34,965
Yupa' s a man who is f ated
to search forever

164
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,002
Fa te<i>,</i> huh. . .

165
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,805
Obaba, what' s
he searching f or?

166
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:45,043
Oh<i>,</i> my, don' t you
know. Nausicaa?

167
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,517
Look, see the tapestry on the wall. . .

168
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,214
I no longer see it

169
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,123
The figure in the left corner

170
00:19:56,094 --> 00:20:00,258
''. . . clothed in blue robes<i>,</i>

171
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,698
''descending onto a golden field<i>,</i>

172
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:08,432
''to join bonds
with the grea t earth

173
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:13,435
''and guide the people
to the pure land. a t last''

174
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:17,942
Lord Yupa<i>,</i> l always thought
tha t was only a legend

175
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,780
You mustn' t tease me, Obaba

176
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,446
It' s the same thing

177
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:28,449
l only wish to solve
the Sea of Decay' s mysteries

178
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,920
Are we humans but a tribe
destined to be swallowed

179
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,124
and ruined by the Sea of Decay?

180
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,101
Tha t is what l wish to know

181
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,446
If only l could help Lord Yupa. . .

182
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,162
Princess<i>,</i> Princess

183
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,173
Wha t is it. Mito?

184
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,676
A strange scent on the wind

185
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,672
It' s nearly dawn

How is it?

187
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,917
It s one fine storm<i>,</i>
but something' s amiss

188
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,408
Over there !

189
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,637
Look !

190
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,278
It' s a ship

191
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,652
Why would a ship be here?

192
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,824
What is it?

193
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,155
Lord Yupa
It' s a ship

194
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:11,221
A ship !

195
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,160
It' s coming closer

196
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,402
It' s huge !

197
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,637
It' s a Tolmekian ship

198
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,909
It' s not flying right

199
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,146
It' s an emergency landing

200
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,913
Help me up, Gol

201
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,178
Princess<i>,</i> you mustn' t !

202
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,281

203
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,686
It' s coming about

204
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,497
Off you go !

205
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,291
Teto !

206
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,155
How dare they !

207
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,857
They must have landed before
and killed some insects

208
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,664
Turn away !
You' ll crash!

209
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,134

An insect !
An Ushiabu' s alive

00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,842
Oh, no, it' s calling its friends

232
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,284
It can' t fly

233
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,116
Bring guns !

234
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,713
No, if you shoot it,

I' ll kill it now

236
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,056
Guns won' t kill an Ushiabu

No telling how we' d suff er f or

00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,080
An Ohm. . .

Found one !
Come !

250
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,949
Here !

251
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,320
So those were spores
stuck to tha t ship

252
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,357
They haven' t released
any toxins yet

253
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,427
We' re almost done

254
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,863
l know
We can' t miss a single one

255
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,768
What on earth is this?

256
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,368
The fire didn t destroy it. . .

257
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,642
Leave this mystery
for later, folks

258
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,115
Go and help burn the spores

259
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,685
Be careful. now

260
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,017
Why' d she bring this
bundle of trouble here

261
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,593
Mito<i>,</i> look here

262
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,703
It' s pulsing
Almost like it' s alive

263
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,629
Lord Yupa<i>,</i> what is this. . .

264
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,437
On my journey
l heard ominous rumors. . .

265
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,707
That a monster from the
old world tha t had slept

266
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,406
beneath Pejite,
had been unearthed

267
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,911
A monster from the old world?

268
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,748
Giant Warriors. . .

269
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:22,717
The Giant Warriors !

270
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,484
They say they were destroyed
in the Seven Days of Fire

271
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:28,923
This. . .

272
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,229
The Giant Warriors were all
said to have turned to stone

273
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:46,933
But a single one slept in
the earth for 1<i>,</i> 000 years

274
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,942
ln. . . ln a way, the thing
looks almost human

275
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:56,515
Tolmekia' s a savage military state<i>,</i>
f ar to our west

276
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,952
And remember the Pe jite
captive who perished. . .

277
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,454
Keep up the good work

278
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,435
What' s tha t?

279
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,865

That' s Yupa. . .

294
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,302
I ask you Tolmekian warriors

295
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:37,177
Last night, these villagers toiled
despera tely to save one of your ships

296
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,448
We have just now gently
laid one of your dead to rest

297
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:46,421
ls this how you Tolmekians treat
such a nation. however weak !

298
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,925
lf you would make war,
you must have reasons

299
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,361
You should first send a messenger
to declare them

300
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,933
Nausicaa. . .
Be calm<i>,</i> Nausicaa

301
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,929
lf you fight now,
they will slaughter the villagers

302
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,442
We must survive
Wait for our chance

303
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,847
You. . .

Are you Yupamiralda<i>,</i>
the greatest swordsman of this region?

310
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,961
We have not come for slaughter
We wish to talk

Listen well !

315

Her Highness Kushana<i>,</i> Division

Frontier Forces will speak

317
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,384
We have come to unif y

319
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:39,065
You live on the brink of extinction
beside the Sea of Decay

ls tha t possible?

324
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,314
We have revived the
miraculous skills and power

to rule this earth

326
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,818
For those who submit to us<i>,</i>

the toxins and insects of that swamp

00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,329
You must not harm the Sea of Decay

00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,433
What' s that<i>,</i> you old hag

331
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,067
Take her away

332
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,839
Let her speak

333
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,511
ln the 1, 000 years
of the Sea of Decay<i>,</i>

334
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:30,246
countless times have humans
sought to burn it away

335
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:34,688
Yet. . . each time herds
of Ohms<i>,</i> blind with rage,

336
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:39,456
have swarmed the earth,
like a tidal wave

337
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:52,067
Destroying nations,
swallowing cities.

338
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,577
the Ohms' rage would not quiet

339
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,945
until they starved to death

340
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,777
ln time, the spores

341
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,856
took root in the Ohms' rotting flesh<i>,</i>

342
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,217
and engulf ed our vast
earth in this Sea of Decay

343
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,121
You must not touch
the Sea of Decay

344
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,029
Enough !
No more of your ravings

345
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,998
Ah ! What will you do?

346
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,127
Kill me. too?

347
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,633
You!

348
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,598
Kill me if you will !

349
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,200
Easy work to murder
an old blind woman

350
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,336
Just as you murdered Jihl

351
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,771
Not Jihl !

352
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,748
How cruel !
He was helpless !

353
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,812
Shut them up !

354
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,356
Show no mercy to impudence !

355
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,289
Wait<i>,</i> everyone !

356
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,088
Please listen to me

357
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,928
l don' t want anymore sacrifices

358
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,062
Please

359
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:55,601
Princess. . .

360
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,838
You<i>,</i> too, Obaba

361
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,276
We must submit to these people

362
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,623
Step on it

363
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,575
Hurry up

364
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,683
It really is a lovely valley

365
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,910
I' m against it

366
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,155
We have orders to send the
Giant Warrior back a t once

367
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,715
An order we can t possibly fulfill

368
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,818
Even our biggest ship
collapsed from its weight

369
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:55,160
But you can' t be serious
about building a na tion here. . .

370
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,731
And what if l am?

371
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,599
You expect me to hand over that
monster as a toy f or those fools?

372
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,505
You have a point. . .

373
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,667
I am but a simple soldier

374
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,836
Such a decision is beyond my position

375
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,410
You' re a sly f ox

376
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:19,086
While l' m in Pejite, your priority
is to revive tha t Giant Warrior

377
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,849
Yes

378
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,248
Can this gun ship fly?

379
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,487
Yes, we found it here

380
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,860
Get this straight
l' m not asking you

381
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,997
But take the Princess to Pe jite. . . .

382
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,504
5 hostages, the gun ship and food. . .

383
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,698
You pick the hostages

384
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:40,003
Prepare everything
for the morning

385
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,888
Thanks for going as a hostage

386
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,982
We' re fine<i>,</i> but look

387
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,391
They' re taking everything in sight

388
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:03,063
l will slip away<i>,</i> return in secret
and await my chance

389
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,193
We must prevent that
monster' s resurrection

390
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:06,894
Yes

391
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,766
Nausicaa

392
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:30,055
Teto<i>,</i> where is she?

393
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,209
Nausicaa ! What on earth is this?

394
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,778
These plants are from
the Sea of Decay

395
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,481
l' ve grown them
from spores l collected

396
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,784
Don' t worry. they' re not toxic

397
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,555
Not toxic. . .

398
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,689
The air here is pure indeed<i>,</i> but. . .

399
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,660
Why. . . with this deadly poisonous
plant blooming

400
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,166
The castle windmill draws

401
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,675
wa ter from deep within the earth

402
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,438
The sand, too<i>,</i> comes from
the very bottom of the well

403
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,079
With pure water and soil,

404
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,210
the plants from the Sea of Decay
are not poisonous

405
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,846
The pollution lies in the earth itself

406
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,447
Even the earth of our valley

407
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:09,957
Why. . .

408
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,820
Who made such a
terrible mess of the world?

409
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,466
Did you do this all yourself?

410
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,593
Yes

411
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,638
To cure my father' s illness
and tha t of others

412
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,298
But. . .

413
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,502
l' m closing it down

414
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:33,439
l just shut off the wa ter and
they' ll soon wither and die

415
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,291
Nausicaa

416
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,095
I frighten myself

417
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,103
l don' t know wha t my rage
will make me do

418
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,432
I don' t want to kill anyone

419
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,873
Princess

420
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,272
We gathered these f or you

421
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,243
Chiko nuts

422
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,076
They' re for you

423
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,341
All of you. . .

424
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,110
So many

425
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,086
You' ve worked so hard

426
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,415
Thank you

427
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,092
They' re very precious

428
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,355
It' s not fair, Princess

429
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,354
All aboard !
We' re taking of f

430
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,424
There. now

431
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,565
You mustn' t cry

432
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,867
Don t worry
I' ll be home in no time

433
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,864
Really?

434
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,405
Why<i>,</i> have l ever lied to you?

435
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,637
No

436
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,204
Right?

437
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,110
Yeah

438
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:12,613
Promise?

439
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,215
Yes

440
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:15,880
Go along, it' s dangerous

441
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,283
OK

442
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,419
You promised !

443
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,004
Take care of the Princess !

444
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,687
Aren' t we in Pe jite yet?

445
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,955
My back is killing me

446
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,260
Boy oh boy<i>,</i> did the Princess
ever pick a bunch of losers

447
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,461
Hey, isn' t this strange?

448
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,871
Why do they fly so close together?

449
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,473
Like they' re a fraid of an attack

450
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,763
Toxins swirl below the clouds

451
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,672
Don' t move

452
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,178
A gun ship !

453
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,153
Enemy fire !
They' ve hit ship #2 !

454
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:43,731
I told you so

455
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,734
Wow<i>,</i> terrifying !

456
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,574
Defense forma tion !

457
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,733
That' s a Pejite gun ship

458
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:53,634
Pe jite !

459
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,381
Damn ! They got #3

460
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,322
What' s the Korvet doing?

461
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,826
Their ships just crumble

462
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,829
Oh no<i>,</i> he' s hit our tail

463
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,140
The Barge tether snapped

464
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,753
Hurry, Teto

465
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,237
Oh, no, we' re going down

466
00:47:59,009 --> 00:47:59,600
Princess !

467
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,841
Stop ! No more killing !

468
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,355
No more !

469
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,111
Princess

470
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:49,785
Hurry<i>,</i> Mito !

471
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,652
Princess<i>,</i> we' re doomed

472
00:48:58,502 --> 00:48:59,366
Maybe I can fly it

473
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,527
Are you crazy !

474
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:03,368
Hurry<i>,</i> Mito !

475
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,373

00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:09,303
Start the engine !
Blast open the door !

477
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:18,680
Come !

478
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,817

00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:26,885
Ready or not !

Go !

485
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,981
Put on the toxin mask

486
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,484
Drop below the clouds
to find the Barge

487
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,728
You' re still warm
Don' t give up, Teto

488
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,179
Wha t is this place !

489
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,476
l ve never seen
such dense toxins

490
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,484
Keep an eye on the right tail

491
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:24,451
It' s nearby

492
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,081
It' s still alof t

493
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,949
Hey ! You' re right !

494
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,521
There it is !

495
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,307
It' s the Princess !
Princess !

496
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,939
Don' t give up, everyone

497
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,013
l' ll throw you a rope

498
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,442
Our hook' s broken

499
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,517
You can' t hook us in mid-air

500
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,951
l don t want to crash and
become insect food !

501
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,023
We' ll leap to our dea ths !

502
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,518
Don' t panic !
Ditch your cargo

503
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,684
Good bye
Farewell !

504
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,526
Listen to me !
Toss your cargo !

505
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,357
Kill the rear engine

506
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,365
Wha t?

507
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,231
The engine noise is too loud
Hurry !

508
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,166
Yes !

509
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,161
Wha t?

510
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,878
Princess. . .

00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,809

You' ll die !

513
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,752
Put your mask on !

Please ! Put your mask back on !

518
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,763
The Princess is smiling

519
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:46,995
We re going to be OK

520
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,867
Hurry ! Lose the cargo

521
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,299
Princess, we' re in a nose-dive !

522
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,274

Thanks f or saving me

00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,332
Why' d you save her, Princess?

531
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,270
You' re a fool

532
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,841
You thought l' d grovel
in gratitude?

533
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,337
You know nothing of the Sea of Decay

534
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,878
It isn' t like the human world

535
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:44,784
There' s no knowing what
a single gunshot will bring

536
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,519
Tha t battle hurled
ships into this f orest

537
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,149
The insects are furious

538
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,852
Look up

539
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,339
The Yamma are sentries

540
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,875
They' ll quickly bring other insects

541
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,838
We must escape now
Throw me your extra rope

542
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,880
Mito<i>,</i> fix the hook

543
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,079
Don' t move
I give the orders

544
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,589
Wha t are you so a fraid of?

545
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,486
You' re just like
a lost f ox-squirrel

546
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,348
How dare you !

547
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,849
Don' t be a fraid

548
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:28,590
We just want you to go back
to your own country

549
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,866
You. . .

550
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:42,237
They' re here !

551
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,251
Quiet ! Don' t anger them

552
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,162
This is an Ohm' s nest !

553
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,256
We' re surrounded

554
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,579
They' re examining us

555
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,559
Forgive us. Ohm,

556
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,059
for disturbing your nest

557
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:38,061
Please understand<i>,</i>
we' re not your enemies

558
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,153
Princess !

559
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:11,818
He s still alive

560
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,987
Wait<i>,</i> Ohm !

561
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,172
What' s happening?

562
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,270
Their eyes have turned blood-red

563
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,753
What will you do with the glider?

564
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,251
When the waters quiet,
take of f and wait f or me above

565
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,257
lf l' m not back in 1 hour,
return to the valley

566
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:50,889
But. . .

567
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,968
Princess !

568
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,043
She' s gone

569
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,286
Hand it over

570
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,088
All right, everyone

571
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:22,130
We' ll do as the Princess said

572
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,526
Princess. . .

573
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,351
Damn !

574
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:28,988
Who are you?

575
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:30,531
You think only of killing

576
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,892
My flares and charms
won' t help now

577
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,289
It' s quicksand !

578
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,097
Damn !

579
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,794
It' s been 2 hours already

580
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:11,833
More and more insects

581
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,834
Princess !

582
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,197
Princess !

583
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,682
Nausicaa

584
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,714
Nausicaa

585
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,823
Come here

586
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,120
Come here

587
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,390
Fa ther

588
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,541
Mother' s here. too

589
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:09,816
No<i>,</i> I don' t want to go

590
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,992
Stay away !

591
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:18,790
There' s nothing here

592
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,801
l said<i>,</i> there' s nothing !

593
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,833
Stay inside

594
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,406
It' s a baby Ohm

595
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,344
She' s being used by the insects

596
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,384
Give it to me, Nausicaa

597
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,216
No ! It' s not doing anything bad

598
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:43,349
lnsects and humans can' t
live in the same world

599
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,998
Please, don' t kill it !

600
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,539
Please !

601
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:19,994
Teto. . .

602
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,381
Wha t a strange place

603
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,628
Hey !

604
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,129
l finally found it

605
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,193
How are you f eeling?

606
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,598
Where are we?

607
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,336
First<i>,</i> let me thank you

608
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,965
l' m Asbel of Pejite

609
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,201
Thank you for saving me

610
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:46,573
l' m Nausicaa of
the Valley of the Wind

611
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:48,711
Where are we?

612
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,854
No wonder you' re surprised

613
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,513
We' re beneath the Sea of Decay

614
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,457
Beneath the Sea of Decay?

615
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,550
Look, we fell from up there.

616
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,556
along with the sand

617
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,061
We' re not wearing masks

618
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,926
That' s right
The air here is pure

619
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,970
Couldn' t believe it myself,

620
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,871
finding this place
under the Sea of Decay

621
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,010
What is it?

622
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:36,064
Nausicaa<i>,</i> don' t wander too f ar

623
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,287
What a wonderful tree

624
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,472
Even though it' s dead,
wa ter still flows through it

625
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,704
Just like the sand
at the bottom of our well

626
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:06,917
Grains of petrified wood
sifting down from above

627
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,273
Nausicaa

628
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:32,773
Are you crying?

629
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,746
Yes
I' m so happy

630
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,907
Lastel was my twin sister

631
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,304
I should have been with her

632
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,380
l' m sorry l didn' t
tell you sooner

633
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,040
Oh, no. . .

634
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,017
l' m sorry

635
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,850
l nearly killed the person
who eased my sister' s pain

636
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:19,060
l see. . .
So it' s in the Valley of the Wind

637
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:28,567
This nut tastes really weird

638
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:32,030
It' s a chiko nut
It' s really good f or you

639
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:48,322
It doesn' t taste grea t<i>,</i>
but l could ea t a whole boot-full !

640
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,698
Why the Sea of Decay was born. . .

641
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:04,539
You think the strangest thoughts

642
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:09,077
The trees of the Sea of Decay
grew to cleanse

643
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,772
a world polluted by humans

644
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:15,146
They absorb toxins from the earth<i>,</i>

645
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:19,051
genera te pure crystals,
die and turn to sand

646
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:23,052
That' s what created
these underground caverns

647
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,428
The insects protect this f orest

648
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:31,331
ln tha t case, we' re doomed

649
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,264
We can' t possibly survive,

650
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:36,429
living in terror of toxins and insects
f or thousands of years

651
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,943
At least we can find a way
to keep it from spreading

652
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,411
You sound just I ike Kushana

653
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:49,581
No ! We don' t plan to use
the Giant Warriors !

654
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,414
You' ll see when you
meet my friends tomorrow

655
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,779
Let' s go to sleep

656
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:57,154
We have far to go tomorrow

657
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,247
All' s well

658
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:26,781
On schedule?

659
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,255
The torso is solidif ying well

660
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:57,047
You' re one cute monster

661
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,621
Makes a poor soldier think

662
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,555
of dusting of f old ambitions

663
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,555
It s grinning

664
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:12,498
You should' ve slept beneath
the earth til the end of time

665
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:13,899
Counselor !

666
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:17,839
Her Highness' planes were
a ttacked by Pejite survivors

667
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,908
All crashed, except the Korvet

668
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:21,900
Wha t about Her Highness?

669
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:25,106
Her ship exploded in flight

670
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,015
Counselor

671
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:33,177
- The villagers don' t know yet?
- No

672
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,517
OK<i>,</i> we'll head out

673
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,921
You stay here and keep working

674
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:48,794
Either f ortune' s finally smiling
on this lowly soldier. . .

675
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,634
Or it s a trap set to destroy me. . .

676
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,147
Mito and the others have returned<i>,</i>

677
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,151
waiting a t Acid Lake, Lord Yupa

678
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,235
In shame we return without her

679
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,608
No, no<i>,</i> l' m pleased you' re sa fe

680
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,578
Releasing me?

681
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,381
Drown the Giant Warrior
deep in Acid Lake<i>,</i>

682
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:42,218
and return to your country. . .

683
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:44,683
Few of your soldiers remain here

684
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:49,230
We could easily start a fight,
but why sacrifice more people?

685
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:51,822
Fire and wa ter are powerless against it<i>,</i>

686
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:54,926
and it' s only a matter of time
before it starts to walk

687
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:58,504
Don' t you see?
It' s far too la te to turn back

688
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:02,039
My orders to invade Pe jite
were motivated by fear

689
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,510
that another country had
harnessed its strength

690
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,677
Once its presence here is known<i>,</i>

691
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:11,014
the great powers will
send their armies

692
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,523
You have but one choice left

693
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,617
Revive the Giant Warrior,
defy both grea t powers

694
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,162
and learn to live with that thing

695
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,526
Look

696
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,528
An insect did tha t. . . ?

697
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:34,298
Whoever becomes my husband
will see worse than that

698
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,770
Burn the Sea of Decay<i>,</i>
kill the insects,

699
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,313
and restore the human world
Why do you hesitate !

700
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:44,842
Steal it from us, just as
we stole it from Pejite

701
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,823
We shall not give
the Giant Warrior life

702
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:53,655
Emergency !

703
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,320
What' s the password?

704
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,557
I' m in a hurry !

705
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,461
Wind

706
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:58,590
Valley !

707
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,291
OK

708
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,732
Some spores survived !

709
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,228
Wha t !

710
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:05,738
They' re spreading toxins
and the valley' s going crazy !

711
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:15,249
Hand 'em over

712
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:17,676
Hurry up !

713
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,913
Hurry<i>,</i> or the valley' s doomed

714
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:22,820
We need our tools back

715
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,761
The tools tha t burn spores
can also be used as weapons

716
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:30,787
We have no choice
Release everything but their guns

717
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:32,794
The Korvet' s taking of f

718
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,163
Get through this time

719
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:38,262
Summon all our troops
from Pejite to this valley

720
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,273
Good grief, now
this is a real mess

721
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:44,403
Hurry

722
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:45,775
Hurry

723
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,878
Find the Princess

724
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,145
Look a fter the valley

725
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:53,448
Be careful until we return

726
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:01,021
We' re going to the valley

727
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,338
It' s no use, the spores
are already here

728
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:20,344
And on this side, too

729
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,116
Move !

730
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,685
What are you doing !

731
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,854
Oh<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> here, too

732
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,925
Obaba

733
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,851
We' ve no choice but to burn it

734
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,862
This forest is doomed

735
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:40,864
lf we hesita te, the Sea of Decay
will consume our valley

736
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,235
lsn' t there anything to be done?

737
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:47,706
This f orest guarded
the reservoir for 3 centuries

738
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:50,869
Damn ! lf only they' d never come

739
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:01,112
This is getting out of hand

740
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,690
Let' s go help them

741
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,137
You think so?

742
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,731
l think it looks the same as ever

743
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:24,244
The insects have gone

744
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:30,713
l wonder why my heart' s
pounding so hard

745
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:32,511
We' re almost there

746
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,515
My friends are just
over that mountain

747
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,108
Pe jite looks strange

748
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,679
Wha t is tha t haze?

749
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,780
Asbel<i>,</i> your mask

750
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,288
Insects ! All dead

751
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,054
Head f or Pejite

752
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,288
Be careful, the Tolmekian
army must be there

753
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,949
Even an Ohm. . .

754
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,747
It attacked the Great Dome

755
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,563
Pe jite' s finished

756
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:27,533
They wiped out the Tolmekians<i>,</i>
but this is. . .

757
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:30,799
They wiped out?
Wha t do you mean. Asbel?

758
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:35,276
It' s a Brig

759
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:38,244
My friends' ship !
They re landing<i>,</i> let' s go !

760
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:51,147
Asbel !

761
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:52,385
You' re alive !

762
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,527
Wha t have you done?

763
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:55,891
We can' t rebuild it

764
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,022
You' ve seen the city

765
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,897
Don' t worry, if the Sea of Decay
swallows it, we' ll burn it away

766
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,800
But the Giant Warrior isn' t here

767
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,135
I know<i>,</i> it' s in the Valley of the Wind

768
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:06,900
How did. . .

769
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,611
We haven' t exactly been idle

770
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,680
We' ve launched our 2nd phase

771
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,982
We' ll wipe out the Tolmekians
in the valley tonight

772
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,176
Wha t !

773
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:20,018
What are you going to do?

774
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,680
Who' s this<i>,</i> Asbel?

775
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,651
Nausicaa from
the Valley of the Wind

776
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:26,918
l owe her my lif e

777
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:28,927
Valley of the Wind. . .

778
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,923
Tell me. wha t will happen?

779
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:38,067
You must know, Asbel !
Tell me

780
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,041
They' ll provoke an insect a ttack

781
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,879
So you made them
a ttack Pejite, too !

782
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,510
You' re. . . horrible. . .

783
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:58,159
We simply have to recover the
Giant Warrior before they revive it

784
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,091
We' re doing it to save the world

785
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,090
And so you' ll murder
everyone in the Valley !

786
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,394
Stop it ! Call it of f ! Please !

787
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:08,969
It' s too late

788
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,595
Once they ve started,
no one can stop them

789
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:18,304
We' ve lost most of our
people to the Tolmekians

790
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,248
This is the only way

791
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,785
Let go ! Let me fly !

792
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:38,924
It' s horrible now, but the Giant
Warrior will purge the Sea of Decay

793
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:40,797
and rebuild the human world

794
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,760
Liar ! You' re just like the Tolmekians

795
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,272
No<i>,</i> they want to use it for destruction

796
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:49,973
You drink wa ter from the wells<i>,</i> too

797
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:53,104
Do you know what purifies tha t water?

798
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:56,651
The trees in the Sea of Decay
cleanse all the lakes

799
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,015
and rivers tha t humans polluted !

800
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,779
And you want to destroy tha t !

801
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,017
Why did you dig up
that Giant Warrior !

802
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,524
What choice do we have?

803
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,721
Subject ourselves to Tolmekian rule?

804
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,127
Never<i>,</i> never !

805
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,429
Tell them, Asbel, how
the Sea of Decay came to be

806
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,298
How the insects protect this world!

807
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:18,935
Please<i>,</i> Asbel!

808
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,172
What are you doing !

809
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:24,040
Don' t move !
Release her

810
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,343
Calm down, Asbel

811
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:27,811
l m serious

812
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:29,706
Release her

813
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:31,809
Nausicaa<i>,</i> go and warn them !

814
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:38,617
Asbel

815
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:39,455
Let me go !

816
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,852
Fools

817
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:19,760
No stopping fighting once it starts

818
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:22,029
But he warned us to be careful. . .

819
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,630
Quit dawdling and use the tanks
to rescue our men

820
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:28,038
Counselor ! They got the last man !

821
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:29,742
Coming our way?

822
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,004
I don' t know

823
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,080
The whole village is gathering

824
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:37,014
Why do they go berserk
over a little f orest or two?

825
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,551
Just as it was with Pe jite

826
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:50,724
They got our tank !

827
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,760
Hurry. get it moving

828
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:55,096
Don' t panic

830
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,130

Hurry up !

832
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:05,041
Maybe this is it?

833
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,106
It' s moving !

834
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:10,150
Which way?

835
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,053
Forward<i>,</i> move f orward

01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,626

Damn ! Mobilize all the tanks

838
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:38,179
She survived. . .

839
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,338
So much for my dreams. . .

840
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,012
Your Highness !

841
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:48,455

01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:51,354
Lead everyone to saf ety

All right

844
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:58,020

returns with the gun ship

845
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:04,230
Hurry everyone !

846
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,668

Are you sure?

852
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:36,401
It s a Pejite Brig

853
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:38,530
I saw it peeking through the clouds

854
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,231
OK !

855
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:56,250

It' s useless ! l' ve lost control !

884
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:00,707
The ship is breaking apart

885
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:04,214
We have to leave
the clouds and fight

886
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:11,855
They were expecting us

887
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:22,130
Wha t are they up to?

888
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,205
Forcing us into the clouds

01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:31,646
They' re waiting f or her return

923
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:32,548
Return?

924
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:36,285
They believe tha t girl will
return with their gun ship

925
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,053
Tha t gun ship' s a pain
It' s our chance to a ttack

926
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:43,289
Do you know what tha t ship is?

927
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:46,195
It' s from bef ore
the Seven Days of Fire

928
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,565
The one they say
went as f ar as the stars. . .

929
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:52,468
It' s too strong for our guns<i>,</i>

930
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:54,438
but bury it in a hole. . .

931
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,567
I, too<i>,</i> wish to wait

932
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:01,175
lf she really does return from
deep in the Sea of Decay. . .

933
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:05,583
l' d like a chance
to really talk to her

934
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:11,424
Made up your minds?

935
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:14,523
lf you' ll aid our attack,
I' ll let you go

936
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:17,322
You want to end up like Pe jite?

937
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:21,267
You' re a Princess<i>,</i> too

938
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:24,395
You' re nothing like our Princess

939
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:26,097
Look at my hand

940
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:29,103
That s wha t King Jihl had

941
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:33,108
ln 6 more months
it will be stone

942
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,580
But our Princess said,

943
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:38,709
she liked these hands

944
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,117
They were the beautiful hands
of a hard worker

945
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,751
You want to live
with the Sea of Decay

946
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:48,124
even as its toxins ravage you?

947
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:53,860
You use fire
We use it a bit<i>,</i> too

948
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:57,028
Too much fire
and nothing will grow

949
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:00,297
Fire can turn the f orest
into ashes in a single day

950
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,238
Water and wind sustain
a f orest f or 100 years

951
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:07,109
We like the water and the wind

952
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:11,173
The sight of our f orest
will grieve the Princess

953
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,479
Counselor<i>,</i> we await your orders

954
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,488
Shut up

955
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:17,558
Yes sir

956
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:25,060
Who knows what happened<i>,</i>
but she sure looks cute

957
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:28,067
Let them go<i>,</i> Kurotowa !

958
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:30,561
Huh? You want to wait?

959
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:32,563
Feed the soldiers

960
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:35,005
We attack in 1 hour

961
01:33:37,311 --> 01:33:41,077
Food, huh?
Finally. a real meal

962
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:43,078
Someone' s coming !

963
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:46,078
It' s Gol and the others

964
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,088
What is it?

965
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:53,451
There' s no wind

966
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:55,522
No wind?

967
01:33:57,198 --> 01:33:59,462
You' re right<i>,</i> the wind s stopped

968
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,198
Obaba<i>,</i> wha t is it?

969
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,463
Obaba

970
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:08,531
Someone. . .
Someone take me outside. . .

971
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:16,974
The wind' s never stopped before

972
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:34,398
Obaba<i>,</i> my ears hurt

973
01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:38,967
The air. . .
The very air is thick with rage

974
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:55,444
We' re close !

975
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:58,658
We' re clear of the Sea of Decay !
3 minutes to Acid Lake !

976
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:01,653
ldle the engines
Drop benea th the clouds

977
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:12,670
What' s this glow !

978
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:15,664
Ohms !

979
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:37,197
The Sea of Decay is spreading
They' re headed f or the Valley

980
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,357
How did they stampede the Ohms. . .

981
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:48,207
Someone s baiting them

982
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:51,107
Mito ! Turn towards Sirius

983
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,009
Yes !

984
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,029
It' s there

985
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:22,575
Mito<i>,</i> a flare !

986
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:24,806
Ready

987
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:27,002
Fire !

988
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:33,575
What is that?

989
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:47,360
How cruel. . .

990
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:50,232
They' re baiting them
with a baby

991
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:52,032
I' ll shoot 'em down!

992
01:36:52,406 --> 01:36:53,566
No<i>,</i> Mito !

993
01:36:55,276 --> 01:36:57,744
Don' t shoot !

994
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,417
Why not ! Why shouldn' t l?

995
01:37:04,518 --> 01:37:07,078
Kill the baby,
and the stampede will never end !

996
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:10,719
Wha t can we do !
They ll destroy the Valley

997
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:12,250
Calm down, Mito

998
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,987
Return the baby to them
Let' s try

999
01:37:23,003 --> 01:37:24,402
Wha t are you doing, Princess !

1000
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:26,603
You go ahead and warn them

1001
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:28,935
Princess !

1002
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,307
You' re not even armed

1003
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,585
That' s not one of our flares

1004
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:45,283
How f ar?

1005
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:48,088
20 leagues
The other side of the lake

1006
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:50,095
ls it a gun ship?

1007
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:51,528
Probably

1008
01:37:59,273 --> 01:38:00,968
That' s a distress signal

1009
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:03,134
It' s definitely the gun ship

1010
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:05,278
It' s been an hour<i>,</i> let' s go

1011
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:06,573
Why not wait?

1012
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,671
The bloodshed is inevitable

1013
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:17,683
Infantry advance

1014
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:23,860
Your Highness<i>,</i> get inside

1015
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:25,124
I' m fine here

1016
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,136
The gun ship !

1017
01:38:36,777 --> 01:38:38,301
Fire !

1018
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:48,810
Hold your fire !

1019
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,891
Stop it ! Stop !

1020
01:38:54,895 --> 01:38:55,759
Princess !

1021
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,993
Stand-by
Don' t fire

1022
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,760
Your Highness

1023
01:39:04,672 --> 01:39:05,604
Where' s the girl !

1024
01:39:05,706 --> 01:39:06,764
The Princess !

1025
01:39:06,874 --> 01:39:08,466
She' s not here

1026
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:10,873
The Ohm, a stampede
It' s coming this way

1027
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:12,070
Wha t !

1028
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:12,873
The Ohm!

1029
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:16,507
The Princess stayed behind
to stop them

1030
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,010
This is no time for battle

1031
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:22,817
Everyone run, find the
highest place you can ! Now !

1032
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:28,885
Obaba, l see a red glow

1033
01:39:31,832 --> 01:39:33,424
It' s spreading

1034
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:34,933
It' s coming this way

1035
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:38,596
You hold on tight

1036
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:42,437
There' s no stopping them now

1037
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:44,744
Don' t panic

1038
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:47,875
There' s still time

1039
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:52,551
lf l have to die,
I want to die in the Valley

1040
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:56,384
No<i>,</i> you mustn' t give up,
not while the Princess has faith

1041
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:59,391
Listen, hold them of f
as long as you can

1042
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:00,892
I' ll return soon

1043
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:03,126
Your Highness. not that. . .

1044
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:04,094
It' s not ready yet !

1045
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:07,127

1046
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:08,496
Go !

1047
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:15,840
Don' t shoot ! Listen to me !

1048
01:40:29,823 --> 01:40:31,723
Damn! She flies like a bird

1049
01:40:31,825 --> 01:40:35,022
She' s not an enemy
She wants to say something

1050
01:40:35,129 --> 01:40:37,529
Anyone who interf eres is an enemy

1051
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:41,526
We' d better drop the bait in
the Valley soon. or die ourselves

1052
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:47,530
Here she comes !
Let her come in close, then fire

1053
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:02,048
Now ! Fire !

1054

1057
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:54,404
Ohm. . .

l' m sorry
I can' t ask your forgiveness

1062
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:36,382
It' s too cruel

Don' t move !
You' ll bleed to dea th

1064
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,889

Stop ! Not with those wounds !

1068
01:43:09,149 --> 01:43:11,174
The lake is poison. . .

1069
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:47,585
You. . .

1070
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:17,073
Good baby

1071
01:44:17,184 --> 01:44:21,348

They re coming for you

1072
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:29,853
They' re turning away

1073
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:34,856
Ohm ! Don' t !
The Valley' s that way

1074
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:40,872
They' ve forgotten us in their rage

1075
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:42,839
If l don' t calm them<i>,</i> the Valley. . .

1076
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:59,657
Fools ! Drawing them
with their own fire

01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,784
We' re sa fe

01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:03,362
We' d better get away
Check the engine

1079
01:45:04,464 --> 01:45:06,056
No. no !

1080
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:09,332
We can discuss this

1081
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:11,199
Take us to them

1082
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,068
l must give them the baby

1083
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,631
What' s the point. it' s too la te

1084
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:17,539
They' ll never stop

1085
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:23,115
Drop us in front of them, then

1086
01:45:23,216 --> 01:45:24,080
Take us

1087
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:26,580
But you' ll die. too

1088
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:37,793
Obaba, will we all die?

1089
01:45:38,665 --> 01:45:42,101
lf that' s our f ate<i>,</i>
we must accept it

1090
01:45:42,436 --> 01:45:44,097
They don t even waver

1091
01:45:44,204 --> 01:45:44,795
Let' s retreat

1092
01:45:44,905 --> 01:45:48,102
Idiot ! There' s nowhere to go

1093
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:54,738
Don' t retreat !

1094
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:57,240
Hold your ground
f or Her Highness

1095
01:45:57,718 --> 01:45:58,650

01:45:58,752 --> 01:46:00,014

The Giant Warrior. . .
Giant Warrior

1099
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:49,535
It' s rotting
It' s too soon

1100
01:46:57,444 --> 01:46:58,911
Burn them !

1101
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:00,807
What' s wrong

1102
