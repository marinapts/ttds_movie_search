be passing over our area soon.

more information available.

But, fiirst, here's the weather forecast.

6
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,812
Skies are clearing up,
thanks to a high-pressure front
moving in from the mountains.

7
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:46,248
Mild winds will be blowing in from the west...

00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:48,684

tonight might be the night.

Hi, Miss Dora. Hey, Mom, it's gonna
be clear tonight.

And, guess what.
The radio says there'll be a full moon!

again without asking?

Don't worry. He doesn't mind.

Mom, it's a perfect midnight
for me to leave home.

You mean tonight?
Next month is what you told me.

23
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,553
Yeah, but the next
full moon might be on a cloudy night.

24
00:01:57,578 --> 00:01:59,721

on the perfect midnight.

My, oh, my. What's this all about?

29

It's one of our oldest customs
that when a witch turns 13...

30
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:15,637
she has to leave home for a year
to begin her training.

I know. She seems so young
to be leaving home now.

34
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:30,152
I remember very well
the exact day you arrived in this town.

35

A little girl flew down from the sky
on her broomstick.

36
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:38,860
And, I was certain
she was much too young
to hold such an importantjob...

37

as resident witch.

38
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:44,566

- Yes, but I could fly. Kiki
barely knows how to do that.

39
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:48,604

to teach her how to mix potions like me.

Hurry up! We always said
we'd leave on the perfect night, didn't we?

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,521
Uh-uh. Our plan was that
we would stick around for
another month and play it safe.

46

Ye... Yeah,
I'll expect you then. Thanks.

Hi, Mom, it's me.
I wanted to make sure you knew
that Kiki is leaving tonight.

63
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,135
Yes, midnight.

64
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,455
- Very pretty.
- Lilac would look prettier on me.

65
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,259
- Or, white.
- Witches have worn this color
for a very long time, Kiki.

Oh, Mom, I look really dumb.

67
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:23,598
It's not really important
what color your dress is.

68
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:25,967
What matters is the heart inside.

69
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:29,137
Well, I'm gonna be the very
best witch that I can be, Mom.

70
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:31,807
And, I know having
a good heart is important.

71
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:36,611
- Just follow your heart and keep smiling.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:41,116
- And, be sure to write home
as soon as you're settled.
- Okay.

told me you were growin' up so fast?

always come home.

this morning all by myself.

I'd rather you took my broom.

in any kind of weather.

- Yep! How'd ya guess?

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,253
- I just left home tonight.
- Uh-huh. Would you mind
turning off that radio?

166
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:47,889
I prefer to fly without being distracted.

167

- Oh! Yeah, sure!

168
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:55,330
Could you tell me?
Is it really hard to get settled
into a brand-new city?

169
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:58,400
Oh, yes. A lot can go wrong.

170
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:02,337
But since my skill is fortune-telling,
I can handle anything.

171
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:06,207

- Yes. I tell fortunes about love.

really decided that yet.

Ah. Well, I'm nearly finished with
my training period.

Yes. To you, I'm sure it looks big.

178
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:30,351

Who do you think you are, jumping out
into the street like that?

But I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.

You'll be okay now.
Worked out pretty good, huh?

300
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,263
You gotta be a real witch,
the way you can fly that broom.

301
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:17,698
Do you think, maybe,
you can teach me how to fly it?

302
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:22,270

- Hey, wait!
- Thank you for getting me out of trouble.

But I really shouldn't
be talking to you,
and you wanna know why?

You're kind of old-fashioned,
aren't ya? You sound like my grandmother.

311
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:56,404
Just go away and leave me alone!

I don't understand.

with you, aren't they?

318
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:20,962
No, sir, I'm alone.
I've come to this town because
I'm a new witch in training.

Why don't we go find another town?

are friendlier than this.

Hey there! Your pacifier!

Ma'am, you forgot your baby's pacifiier.!

Oh! Poor baby.

334
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:05,032
Without this, the baby'll wake
up and cry all the way home.

335
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:08,389
I better go give it to her myself.

336

I'm sorry, folks. But could
you wait just a minute? I'll be right back.

- [Woman] Certainly.

338

me to deliver it for you?
- What?

00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:24,652
The woman with the baby carriage
who just went around the corner.

340
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:28,022
- I could reach her in no time.
- Really? You'd do that?

341

- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

- [Gasps] Oh!

348

Sorry to surprise you, but
the lady in the bakery asked me
to return this pacifier.

Yes, sir. Oh, hi there. Come in
and wait a minute, will you?

354

- Excuse me.
- Mmm. These are nice and fresh.
Just out of the oven.

- All right. Thank you very much.

- Mm-hmm.

That'll be all for you?
All right. Thank you.

- Thanks.

But of course.

When I saw you fly off,
I thought for a second I was dreaming!

361
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:49,904
The baby's mother told me
to give you this message.

pacifier. Your new delivery
girl is really quite special."

to show you my thanks.

Follow me. Bakery's downstairs,
upstairs is home.

you like some hot chocolate?

So, tell me if I'm right.

373
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,259
- I'm guessing you're a witch in training.
- You're right.!

374
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:49,630
And I really love it here,
but people don't seem to like
witches in this town.

375
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:51,632
Depends on the people.

- Oh, I see.

379
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:08,616
Why didn't you tell me you have
no place to stay? We have
a spare room in the attic.

380
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:11,318
- You can use that.
- You'd really let me stay with you?

introduced ourselves.

00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:23,010

- And I'm Kiki, ma'am. And Jiji
here is my very best friend.

384
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,367
It's right up here, Kiki.
It may need a little dusting...

Oh, my. It's a little bit
dustier than I remember.

387

- If I weren't about to have
a baby, I'd help you clean.
- That's okay!

All right, then. Water
and bathroom are downstairs.

Jiji, I've decided
not to leave this town.

- Maybe I can stay and find some
other nice people like Osono,
- You know, Jack, I think...

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,564
- who will like me and accept me for who I am.
- Our audience would agree...

cost to get a phone here?

- A phone?
- Yep. We're gonna need a phone.

426
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,757
And I personally think that what
money you have should be spent
on getting us back home.

00:28:09,782 --> 00:28:13,717
Or, at least, on buying me
some decent cat food. And

00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:09,796
- Eww, Tombo.!
- Oh-oh.!

488
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:12,632
You can tell she's a witch
'cause she always wears a dark dress.

489
00:32:12,657 --> 00:32:15,969
Hey, wait! Come back, please.
I didn't mean to insult you!

490
00:32:15,994 --> 00:32:17,371
- Yeah!
- Better luck next time, Tombo!

491
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:21,058
- Come on, you guys.!
- Nice dress.! [Laughter]

492
00:32:22,801 --> 00:32:25,379
Kiki, sometimes you just
have to be who you are...

493
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:27,632
and not care what people think.

494
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,550
Oh, Kiki, perfect timing!

495
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:33,053
There's a lady here
who wants you to make a delivery.!

496
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:36,656
- She's your fiirst customer.
- Customer! Oh, my. I'll be right back!

497
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:41,261
- [Footsteps Running]
- [Panting] Ohh-h-h! Uh...

498
00:32:41,286 --> 00:32:43,930
Now, where's that map?

499
00:32:43,955 --> 00:32:47,822
[Panting]

500
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,605
- She sounds wonde<i>rf</i>ul.
- [Panting] Aah... Uh.

501
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,940
Ah!

502
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:58,745
Dear, this lady is a customer
of ours, and we were talking
about your new delivery service.

503
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,747
What a charming girl!

504
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,251
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.
- Osono's told me great things about you.

505
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:06,253
Do you think you can
deliver this by tonight?

506
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,288
Yeah! I can.

507
00:33:08,313 --> 00:33:10,524
It's a birthday gift for my nephew.

508
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:14,061
But something came up
at work, and I can't make it
to the party on time.

509
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:16,563
I can get it there for you, guaranteed.

510
00:33:16,588 --> 00:33:20,534
- Show me on the map
where you want it delivered.
- Huh? But that's me.

511
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,969
Are you sure it won't be too far?

512
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:25,005
I can fly there straight from here.

513
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:29,142
- Great, how much will it cost?
- Oh. Well, I haven't really
thought about a price.

514
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,812
Aha! How about this much then?

515
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:35,182
I hope it'll be enough.
What do you think?

516
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:37,184
[Gasps] This much for me?

517
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:40,074
That's great! Thank you!

- Huh?

519
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:56,436
Yeah! I gotta see this!

521
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:03,610
- [Gasps]
- [Gasps]

522
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:07,581
- She's the most amazing girl!
- She sure is!

523
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:10,083
Hey, what can you tell me about her?

524
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:12,686
[Jiji] It's beautiful flying weather, and...

525
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:16,523
gee, but we're flying awfully high.

526
00:34:16,548 --> 00:34:20,210
You're getting very good at your flying.

527
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:27,119
Yes. You're just able to fly higher and higher
and higher, aren't you?

528
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,871
Kiki, how high do you intend to go?

529
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:34,841
This is my first job,
and I do not want to be stopped
by that traffic cop.

530
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:40,514
Hmm... Well, don't look now,
but that's an airplane flying under us.

531
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:43,884
This is as high as we'll go,
'fraidy cat. I just want to check the map.

532
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:49,243
Now, let's see. Yep! It's just past the cape.

533
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:56,249
- Here we go! Whee-e-e-e...
- Whoa, boy!

534
00:35:00,158 --> 00:35:04,437
- I'm getting to like this town more and more.
- I'm getting sick to my stomach.

535
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:08,693
I can't wait to write Mom
and Dad about my new business.

537
00:35:23,815 --> 00:35:26,159
Wow!

538
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:29,812
Look who's behind us. Wild geese!

539
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:33,533
And they're coming with us!

540
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:38,289
[Sighs] Aah... Ha.

541
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:49,303
- [Geese Calling]
- Hi-i-i-i! [Laughs]

542
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:01,761
- They seem awfully upset.
- They say they're going to fly higher.

543
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:04,130
- Huh?
- They say a gust of wind's coming.

544
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:07,020
Oh!

- [Squawking Continues]

556
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:47,697
[Kiki] Leave me alone!

557
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:53,713
I wasn't trying to steal your
eggs! Really.! Uh... Uh...

558
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:59,119
Go away.! Go away.! Ugh.!
What was the matter with them?

559
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:03,723
Oh, my goodness!

560
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:06,826
That was your fault.
The geese were kind enough
to warn us of that wind.

561
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,751
- But would you listen?
- Oh, be quiet!

562
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:13,867
Look at them.! Up so high.

563
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:18,271
- That gust of wind took them all the way up.
- Kiki, we've got a problem.!

564
00:37:18,296 --> 00:37:22,475
- The toy fell out!
- We've gotta go back!
[Grunts] Ahh...

565
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,477
- Back to where?
- Where we fell.!

- Come on, Jiji!
- [Birds Squawking]

00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:31,384
[Gasps] Oh!

568
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:34,054
What are they saying now, Jiji?

569
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,691
They're calling you
an egg stealer. And you don't
wanna know what else.

570
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:42,529
- If I were you, I wouldn't
go back down there... again.
- We have to! Hold on!

571
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:45,632

Leave us alone! Stop it!

577
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,865
Maybe we better rethink our plan.

578
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,735
Frankly, I think this is a major insult.

579
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,437
Crows used to serve witches
and do what you told them.

580
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:27,707
Hey, that was a long time ago, okay?

581
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:31,010
How about if we go in after dark?
Go in. Get it. Get out.

582
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:34,447
We won't be able to make it in time.

583
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:36,783
Unless we buy ourselves some time.

584
00:38:36,808 --> 00:38:38,818
You gotta be kidding!

585
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:42,155
You can just pretend to be the doll until
I find the real one.

586
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,825
Why don't you pretend
to be stuffed, and I'll go
get the stupid doll?

587
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,361
- Uh-oh!
- Don't worry. Hold still.

588
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:50,864
- Can I breathe?
- No! No breathing.

- Be quiet!

592
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,647
It must be my present from Auntie.!

593
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:11,232
- Yea! Give it to me! Ha!
- Oh!

594
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,677
This is dumb!

595
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,960
[Laughs]

596
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:25,031
You're a bit late! After
my sister telephoned, we were
wondering where you were.

597
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:27,767
Uh, I'm sorry. Uh...

598
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:33,661
Ah... Um. Could I please have
your signature, ma'am?

599
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:37,310
- Mom, can I put the canary in here?
- Uh-huh.

600
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:41,714
- But you be sure not to let it fly away, Ket.
- 'Kay. [Laughs]

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,958

00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:55,474
Well! Woo...

606
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:59,466
Come on, you stupid bird.!

607
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:04,337
I got a brand-new home for you.
[Grunts]

608
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:08,957

610
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:44,600

you've got to be here somewhere.

Is anybody here? Anybody? Hello!

615
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:20,313
- Anybody here?
- Yes.! Stop shouting.! I'm on
the roof.! What do you want?

616
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:26,019
Why don't you come up?
Good, birdie. Hold it right there.

- What do you want?
- Oh, well, you have a black cat...

620
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:42,392
in your cabin window,
and, you see, it's mine and I need it back.

621
00:41:43,595 --> 00:41:45,572
You're a good birdie, aren't you?

622
00:41:45,597 --> 00:41:48,341
I'm sorry, but, uh, I'm kind of in a hurry.

623
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:50,543
So, why was it alone in the forest, huh?

624
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:53,880
That's where I dropped it.
Um, may I have it back, please?

625
00:41:53,905 --> 00:41:57,050
I really need to finish this.

626
00:41:57,075 --> 00:42:00,186
That's my girl!

627
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:03,702
- You're just about through, okay?

[Sighs]

629
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:14,767
Well, why didn't you tell me
sooner why you needed it
in such a hurry?

630
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:19,105
He keeps me company.
I've gotten sort of fond ofhim, you know?

631
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,240
Thank you.
[Gasps]
Oh...

632
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:23,443
Oh, no!

633
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:25,612
His head's falling off.

634
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:28,448
Ooh, it must have been
the crows. They were making
such a big fuss over him.

635
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:31,451
This is terrible. I can't deliver it like this.

636
00:42:31,476 --> 00:42:34,454
Hm. Hey!

637
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:37,724
- I know. How about we work out a deal?
- Huh?

638
00:42:37,749 --> 00:42:42,662
So, you're on your own at 13.
That's pretty exciting.

639
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:44,664
To be completely independent
and a witch!

640
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,933
- Impressive!
- How's it going?

641
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:48,935
Trust me. He'll be good as new.

642
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,538
Huh... Almost done.

That's right. You just keep sleeping.

00:43:26,597 --> 00:43:33,001
Nice doggy.

I think there's something wrong with it.

782

It's got a mind of its own,
and it doesn't want to heat up.

I can help you.

That's why it busted.
You wait here. I'll be right back.

How great would it be
to go around the world
in a dirigible like that.

Of course, you were flying since
you were very young, huh?

Well, yes, since I was a baby.

1039

My mother used to take me
with her. She taught me
never to be scared.

enjoy flying. You're a witch!

you were such a clown.

"Don't be such a clown.

I'm not mad at all, Tombo.
I have a lot on my mind.

So, please, just leave me alone.

01:20:16,401 --> 01:20:18,426
[Crying]

1144
01:20:27,912 --> 01:20:29,777
[Horn Honks]

1145
01:20:29,914 --> 01:20:32,212
[Girl] Hey! It's mine!

1146
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,755
Uh-huh. It's right over
there across the street.

1147
01:20:43,728 --> 01:20:46,253
Kiki! Kiki!

1148
01:20:46,397 --> 01:20:48,388
- Hey!
- [Kiki Gasps]

1149
01:20:48,533 --> 01:20:50,398
Hi!

1150
01:20:50,535 --> 01:20:54,027
Hi! Well, since you didn't
come and visit me, I thought
I'd come here and visit you.

1151
01:20:54,172 --> 01:20:57,733
I'm sorry.
Well, that's sort of a white lie.
I need to do some shopping too.

1152
01:20:57,876 --> 01:21:00,970
Come on in, 'cause I'm done now, and
I can take a break, okay?

1153
01:21:01,112 --> 01:21:03,603
- You better believe I will.
- [Both Laughing]

1154
01:21:03,748 --> 01:21:08,378
[Sighs] Nice place you have.

1155
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,920
Help yourself to some of these, and
I'll go make us some tea.

1156
01:21:11,055 --> 01:21:15,219
- No tea, thanks, but
some milk if you have any.
- Sure.

1157
01:21:19,764 --> 01:21:24,064
Hey there. Unbelievable.
You're the spitting image of that stuffed cat.

1158
01:21:24,202 --> 01:21:26,067
I bet your name's Jiji, right?

1159
01:21:26,204 --> 01:21:30,937
Comin' through.
So how's the delivery biz?
You makin' any money?

1160
01:21:33,812 --> 01:21:35,746
- [Milk Pours]
- That bad, huh?

1161
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,747
I'm not working much now.

1162
01:21:38,883 --> 01:21:41,750
Mm-hmm.

1163
01:21:46,891 --> 01:21:50,952
Hmm. I kind of thought
you looked unhappy.

1164
01:21:51,095 --> 01:21:55,862
I didn't know things
like that happened to witches.

1165
01:21:59,604 --> 01:22:02,471
Hey! Why don't you come
and stay at my cabin?

1166
01:22:02,607 --> 01:22:04,302
Huh?

1167
01:22:04,442 --> 01:22:07,741
It'll probably make you
feel better. Your boss
would let you have a break.

1168
01:22:07,879 --> 01:22:09,813
How about it, kitty cat?
Wanna come?

1169
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,718
Hmm?
[Giggles]

1170
01:22:14,853 --> 01:22:18,619
Rather be with your girlfriend,
huh? Come on, girl.
Why not? We'll leave now.

1171
01:22:18,756 --> 01:22:21,384
Uh-huh.

1172
01:22:21,526 --> 01:22:24,222
[Meows]

1173
01:22:24,362 --> 01:22:27,024
Come on!

1174
01:22:27,165 --> 01:22:29,326
Pretty day.

1175
01:22:29,467 --> 01:22:31,332
- Hurry! Hurry!
- [Horn Honks]

1176
01:22:31,469 --> 01:22:33,027
The bus is leaving!

1177
01:22:52,957 --> 01:22:54,891
Kiki?

1178
01:22:58,363 --> 01:23:01,764
- [Gum Pops]
- Oh, thank you. Oh. Ooh!

1179
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:10,907
Ahh!

1180
01:23:15,246 --> 01:23:18,579
- Oh!
- [Both Laughing]

1181
01:23:18,716 --> 01:23:24,052
- Okay, now I'm officially exhausted.
- [Laughs]

1182
01:23:24,188 --> 01:23:27,180
It's beautiful here.

1183
01:23:27,325 --> 01:23:29,293
[Inhales] Mmm!

1184
01:23:29,427 --> 01:23:31,395
- Kiki?
- Huh? Coming.

1185
01:23:31,529 --> 01:23:33,929
[Car Approaching]

1186
01:23:34,065 --> 01:23:36,260
[Man]
Get outta the road.!
What's the matter with you?

1187
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:42,067
What's the matter with you?
Must have been blinded by two
beautiful girls in front of him.

1188
01:23:48,346 --> 01:23:50,211
Hey!
[Coughs]

1189
01:23:50,348 --> 01:23:52,213
[Both Coughing]

1190
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:54,215
[Man] Ursula? Is that you?

1191
01:23:54,352 --> 01:23:56,445
- Yea!
- Hop in.!

1192
01:23:56,587 --> 01:23:58,452
I know this guy. Come on.

1193
01:23:58,589 --> 01:24:03,117
You know, when I first saw you,
I didn't recognize you.
I thought you were a boy.

1194
01:24:03,261 --> 01:24:05,821
Huh? You... You really
thought I was a boy?

1195
01:24:05,964 --> 01:24:08,694
Well, it's the way
you're dressed and all.

1196
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:13,133
[Groans] Tell me. What kind of a boy
has these legs, mister?

1197
01:24:13,271 --> 01:24:16,263
Bye, ladies! Take care now!

1198
01:24:18,943 --> 01:24:22,435
- You get along with the crows.
- Yep, we've become real close friends.

1199
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:24,445
Wow!

1200
01:24:24,582 --> 01:24:27,107
- Hello, everybody. I'm home again.
- [Cawing]

1201
01:24:27,251 --> 01:24:31,745
- Good afternoon. Um, I wanna say I'm sorry.
- [Cawing]

1202
01:24:31,889 --> 01:24:35,290
I'm not an egg stealer, and I didn't mean to
cause you any problems.

1203
01:24:35,426 --> 01:24:38,156
Why don't you go inside,
and I'll go get some water?

1204
01:24:38,296 --> 01:24:40,526
Okay.

1205
01:24:46,204 --> 01:24:48,866
[Gasps]
Oh.

1206
01:25:33,985 --> 01:25:36,647
- Like it?
- Yes.

1207
01:25:36,788 --> 01:25:39,723
I have to say I became inspired after
the first time we met.

1208
01:25:39,857 --> 01:25:44,226
But... I really haven't got the face right.

1209
01:25:44,362 --> 01:25:47,422
I've been waiting for you to come back
so I can try again.

1210
01:25:47,565 --> 01:25:49,829
- You mean that's me?
- Sure is.

1211
01:25:49,967 --> 01:25:52,231
You know, you'd make
my life a lot easier if you'd model for me.

1212
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:55,635
But I'm not very beautiful.
What do you want me to do that for?

1213
01:25:55,773 --> 01:25:59,174
[Laughing]

1214
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:03,269
Come on, Kiki. You have got a great face.
You're very pretty.

1215
01:26:03,414 --> 01:26:06,679
Now, don't you be nervous.
Sit down over here.

1216
01:26:10,188 --> 01:26:15,558
Raise your chin up a little.
Look straight ahead. Now, don't move.

1217
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:19,527
Painting and magical powers
seem very much the same.

1218
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:21,564
Sometimes I'm unable to paint a thing.

1219
01:26:21,699 --> 01:26:24,429
You mean it?
Then what? What happens?

1220
01:26:24,569 --> 01:26:29,029
Kiki, please don't move.
It's hard to draw a moving target.

1221
01:26:29,173 --> 01:26:32,802
Without even thinking about it,
I used to be able to fly.

1222
01:26:32,944 --> 01:26:36,573
Now I'm trying to look inside
myself to find out how I did it.

1223
01:26:36,714 --> 01:26:41,947
- But I just can't fiigure it out.
- You know, could be you're
working at it too hard.

1224
01:26:42,086 --> 01:26:43,951
Maybe you shouldjust take a break.

1225
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:46,648
Yeah, but still, if I can't fly...

1226
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:49,919
Then stop trying.
Take long walks. Look at the scenery.

1227
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:52,962
Doze off at noon.
Don't even think about flying.

1228
01:26:53,097 --> 01:26:55,497
And then, pretty soon,
you'll be flying again.

1229
01:26:55,633 --> 01:26:59,262
- You think my problems will...
- Go away? That's right.

1230
01:26:59,403 --> 01:27:04,067
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

1231
01:27:20,558 --> 01:27:24,426
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.

1232
01:27:24,562 --> 01:27:29,431
I loved to paint so much.
I'd paint all day until
I fell asleep right at my easel.

1233
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:32,695
And then one day,
for some reason, I just
couldn't paint anymore.

1234
01:27:32,837 --> 01:27:37,206
I tried and tried,
but nothing I did seemed any good.

1235
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:41,710
They were copies of paintings
I'd seen somewhere before...

1236
01:27:41,846 --> 01:27:44,576
and not very good copies either.

1237
01:27:44,715 --> 01:27:47,206
I just felt like I'd lost my ability.

1238
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,546
That sounds like me.

1239
01:27:51,255 --> 01:27:54,691
It's exactly the same,
but then I found the answer.

1240
01:27:54,859 --> 01:27:57,692
You see, I hadn't
fiigured out what or why
I wanted to paint.

1241
01:27:57,862 --> 01:27:59,693
- I had to discover my own style.
- Mm-hmm.

1242
01:27:59,864 --> 01:28:03,265
When you fly, you rely on what's
inside of you, don't you?

1243
01:28:03,434 --> 01:28:05,925
Uh-huh. We fly with our spirit.

1244
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:09,699
Trusting your spirit!
Yes, yes! That's exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

1245
01:28:09,874 --> 01:28:14,538
That same spirit
is what makes me paint
and makes your friend bake.

1246
01:28:14,712 --> 01:28:18,239
But we each need to find
our own inspiration, Kiki.

1247
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:20,543
Sometimes it's not easy.

1248
01:28:20,718 --> 01:28:25,121
I guess I never gave much thought to why
I wanted to do this.

1249
01:28:25,256 --> 01:28:29,158
I got so caught up
in all the training and stuff.

1250
01:28:29,293 --> 01:28:32,319
Maybe I have to find my own inspiration.

1251
01:28:32,496 --> 01:28:36,899
But am I ever gonna find it?
And is it worth all the trouble?

1252
01:28:37,068 --> 01:28:39,298
Well, for example,
there were quite a few times...

1253
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:42,564
when I thought of painting something
over that painting.

1254
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:46,574
- [Kiki] But it ended up being so great.
- So I guess it's worth it.

1255
01:28:46,744 --> 01:28:49,577
Today when I saw you
I thought, I wanna paint!

1256
01:28:49,747 --> 01:28:53,080
- You've got such a great face.
- That's why I came?

1257
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:57,654
[Laughing]
Hey, well, it's better than
you cleaning my floor again.

1258
01:28:57,788 --> 01:29:01,622
- Let's turn out the lights and go to sleep.
- Okay.

1259
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:03,919
Sorry about taking your bed from you.

1260
01:29:04,095 --> 01:29:06,563
Aw, no problem.

1261
01:29:08,766 --> 01:29:11,394
- So you really think I'll fly again?
- Sure.

1262
01:29:11,569 --> 01:29:13,901
You'll just have to wait
for the right inspiration to come along.

1263
01:29:14,071 --> 01:29:16,539
- You understand?
- Uh-huh.

1264
01:29:16,707 --> 01:29:18,800
Mmm!

1265
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:20,745
[Man On TV] And there it is, folks,
the Spirit of Freedom...

1266
01:29:20,745 --> 01:29:23,077
[Man On TV] And there it is, folks,
the Spirit of Freedom...

1267
01:29:23,247 --> 01:29:25,112
- recently downed in
a spectacular forced landing...
- [Phone Ringing]

1268
01:29:25,249 --> 01:29:27,012
Due to torrential rains
just outside the city limits.

1269
01:29:28,419 --> 01:29:30,910
- Well, it's been repaired.
It is now in fiinal preparation...
- [Osono] Yes?

1270
01:29:31,088 --> 01:29:33,079
Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

1271
01:29:33,257 --> 01:29:36,385
- Kiki! How are you?
- I'm okay. Thanks.

1272
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,961
Well, you take plenty of time coming home.
Oh, and by the way...

1273
01:29:40,097 --> 01:29:42,156
- that older woman you made a delivery for?
- Uh-huh?

1274
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:45,427
She has another delivery
for you. I said I wasn't sure you could do it.

1275
01:29:45,603 --> 01:29:50,131
- She was really very insistent.
What do you think, Kiki?
- Okay.

1276
01:29:50,308 --> 01:29:54,210
Great! Stop there on your way back. Bye.

1277
01:29:54,345 --> 01:29:57,314
Thank you so much for everything.

1278
01:29:57,481 --> 01:29:59,346
Bye.!

1279
01:29:59,483 --> 01:30:03,852
[Birds Chirping]

1280
01:30:05,356 --> 01:30:07,586
[Bell Dinging]

1281
01:30:12,496 --> 01:30:17,627
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well, we've been expecting you.

1282
01:30:17,802 --> 01:30:19,702
Thanks.

1283
01:30:19,837 --> 01:30:23,500
[Man On TV] There are less than five
minutes to takeoff now.

1284
01:30:23,674 --> 01:30:27,201
Um, it's very nice
to see you again, ma'am.

1285
01:30:27,378 --> 01:30:30,438
I'm glad you came.
Please excuse me for not standing.

1286
01:30:30,614 --> 01:30:32,775
My legs are bothering me more than usual.

1287
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:34,815
Barsa, bring the package now.

1288
01:30:34,952 --> 01:30:38,388
Gosh, I hope it hasn't taken off.

1289
01:30:38,556 --> 01:30:42,390
Not yet. Barsa is absolutely mad about
lighter-than-air travel.

1290
01:30:42,526 --> 01:30:44,960
I'm the adventuresome type. Mm-hmm.

1291
01:30:45,129 --> 01:30:47,222
[Man On TV]
The local fiire department
and the Coast Guard stand ready.

1292
01:30:47,398 --> 01:30:49,730
- Could you turn it down, please?
- Certainly.

1293
01:30:49,867 --> 01:30:51,801
Would you do me a favor and open the box?

1294
01:30:51,969 --> 01:30:53,834
Yep.

1295
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:02,077
[Gasps] I don't get it.

1296
01:31:02,213 --> 01:31:05,239
Would you please bring this
to a young delivery girl?

1297
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:07,350
She was kind to me and a very big help.

1298
01:31:07,518 --> 01:31:09,383
It's my way of saying thank you.

1299
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,387
Ah, yes, and can you find out
when her next birthday is?

1300
01:31:12,523 --> 01:31:15,083

any word about the boy?

said that the police car
dropped into a pool.

01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:42,623
##I ever could ##

1462
01:40:42,759 --> 01:40:47,059
##Feel the wind blow through my hair ##

1463
01:40:47,197 --> 01:40:51,361
##Feel the sun dance with the moon ##

1464
01:40:51,501 --> 01:40:53,662
##And my feet can't stay ##

1465
01:40:53,804 --> 01:40:55,897
## On the ground any longer ##

1466
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:58,166
## With every leap of faith ##

1467
01:40:58,308 --> 01:41:00,276
##I feel a little stronger ##

1468
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:03,174
## Wanna swing from a star ##

1469
01:41:03,313 --> 01:41:05,178
##In the big blue sky ##

1470
01:41:05,315 --> 01:41:08,079
##Don't wanna watch it all go by ##

1471
01:41:08,218 --> 01:41:11,984
##So I'm gonna fly ##

1472
01:41:12,122 --> 01:41:14,682
##And see for myself what it looks like ##

1473
01:41:14,825 --> 01:41:18,056
##From up there ##

1474
01:41:18,195 --> 01:41:22,529
##And taste the stardust in my mouth ##

1475
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:24,691
## Chase the clouds ##

1476
01:41:24,835 --> 01:41:26,894
## Until they disappear ##

1477
01:41:27,037 --> 01:41:29,005
##And if I can make ##

1478
01:41:29,139 --> 01:41:31,630
##Just one life better ##

1479
01:41:31,775 --> 01:41:35,472
##Bring a smile to
your face when you're
under the weather ##

1480
01:41:35,612 --> 01:41:40,640
##And I'm feelin'like I've fiinally
found my home ##

1481
01:41:40,784 --> 01:41:43,810
##I'll plant the seeds
and watch them grow ##

1482
01:41:43,954 --> 01:41:45,888
##And I'm gonna ##

1483
