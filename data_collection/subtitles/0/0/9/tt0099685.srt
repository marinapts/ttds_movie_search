1
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,025
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,568
Jimmy?

3
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,904
-What's up?
-Did l hit something?

4
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,697
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,700
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,244
No.

7
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,749
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,403
He's still alive. You piece of shit!

9
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,113
Die, you motherfucker!

10
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,614
Look at me!

11
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:06,711
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.

12
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,710
To me...

13
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,381
...being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

14
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,971
Even before I went to the cabstand
for an after-schooljob...

15
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,432
...I knew I wanted to be part of them.

16
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,811
It was there that I knew I belonged.
To me, it meant being somebody...

17
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,439
...in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

18
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:12,068
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

19
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,696
They parked in front of hydrants
and never got a ticket.

20
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,990
When they played cards all night...

21
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,201
...nobody ever called the cops.

22
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,173
Tony Stacks. How are you?

23
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,093
Tuddy Cicero.

24
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,679
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

25
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:43,808
Tuddy.

26
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:48,270
Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

27
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:53,317
...and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

28
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,824
Paulie might have moved slow...

29
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,414
...but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.

30
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,878
-lt's your fault.
-You started it!

31
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,797
l started it? lt's your fault.

32
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:19,468
At first my parents loved that I found
ajob across the street from the house.

33
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,223
My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

34
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,600
He liked that I got myself ajob.

35
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,354
He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.

36
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,821
Henry! Watch how you cross!

37
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,614
Bring back milk!

38
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,868
My mother was happy after
she found out the Ciceros...

39
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,621
...came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...

40
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,499
...that was the answer to all her prayers.

41
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,086
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

42
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,464
I could go anywhere, do anything.

43
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,176
I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.

44
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,930
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy
would let me park their Cadillacs.

45
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,060
Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...

46
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,187
...and I'm parking Cadillacs.

47
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,650
But, it wasn't too long...

48
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:21,155
...before my parents changed
their minds about myjob at the cabstand.

49
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:26,118
For them, it was supposed to be
a part-timejob. But for me...

50
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,204
...it was definitely full time.

51
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,206
That's all I wanted to do.

52
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:34,627
People like my father could never
understand, but I was part of something.

53
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,546
I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

54
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,173
Tell him 519.

55
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,176
Every day I was learning to score.

56
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,263
A dollar here, a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.

57
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,810
Did you have a good day at school?

58
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:53,145
My father was always pissed off.

59
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,857
Pissed that he made such lousy money,
that my brother Michael...

60
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,484
...was in a wheelchair.

61
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:02,571
He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.

62
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,532
Tell me about this.

63
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,867
lt's a letter from school.

64
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,287
lt says you haven't been there in months.

65
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,207
ln months!

66
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,252
You're a bum!

67
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,754
Want to grow up to be a bum?

68
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:24,385
After a while, he was mostly pissed
because I hung around the cabstand.

69
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,554
He knew what went on there.

70
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:31,475
Every once in a while I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

71
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,352
The way I saw it...

72
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,397
...everybody takes a beating sometime.

73
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,191
l can't make any more deliveries.

74
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,485
What? You'll fuck everything up.

75
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,696
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

76
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,156
Come with me.

77
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,991
-ls that him there?
-No.

78
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,493
-How about him?
-No.

79
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,497
-That's the guy--
-Get him.

80
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,751
Excuse me.

81
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,504
-Scumbag.
-Come here, you piece of shit.

82
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,222
-Know this kid?
-Yeah.

83
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,433
-Know where he lives?
-Yeah.

84
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,560
-You deliver mail to his house?
-Yeah.

85
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:18,647
From now on, any letter from school
to his house comes directly here.

86
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,066
Understand?

87
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,361
Another letter from school
goes to that kid's house...

88
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,654
...in the oven you'll go, head first.

89
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,076
That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.

90
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:32,370
In fact, no more letters from anybody.

91
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,206
After a few weeks, my mother went
to the post office to complain.

92
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,501
How could I go to school after that...

93
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:42,380
...and pledge allegiance and sit through
good government bullshit?

94
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,136
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.

95
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,722
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

96
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,557
All right, make the call.

97
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:58,270
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back.

98
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:01,023
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

99
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:06,612
There were guys, that's all they did all
day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

100
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,582
For a guy who moved all day long...

101
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,794
...Paulie didn't talk to six people.
With union problems...

102
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,838
...or a beef in the numbers...

103
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:27,341
...only the top guys spoke
with Paulie about the problem.

104
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:31,012
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

105
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:34,098
He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...

106
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,184
...or anyone listening to
what he was being told.

107
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:41,814
Hundreds of guys depended on him, and
he got a piece of everything they made.

108
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:46,485
It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

109
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:51,032
All they got from Paulie was protection
from the guys trying to rip them off.

110
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,369
That's what it's all about. That's
what the FBI could never understand.

111
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,080
What Paulie and the Organization does...

112
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:02,001
...is protect people who can't
go to the cops. That's it.

113
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:06,714
They're like the police department
for wiseguys.

114
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:20,644
People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.

115
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,274
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday morning for fresh bread.

116
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,779
The owner knew who I was with, and no
matter how many people were waiting...

117
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,864
...I was taken care of first.

118
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,577
Our neighbors stopped parking in
our driveway, even though we had no car.

119
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:37,745
At 13...

120
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:42,375
...I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.

121
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,168
I had it all.

122
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,928
One day....

123
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:58,724
One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

124
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,351
You know why?

125
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,062
It was out of respect.

126
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,273
What do you think?

127
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,319
Aren't my shoes great?

128
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,406
You look like a gangster.

129
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,324
They shot me. Help!

130
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:19,578
Henry, shut the door.

131
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:23,708
That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

132
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,086
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

133
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,921
l can't have that in this joint.

134
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,882
I remember feeling bad about the guy,
but also...

135
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,260
...feeling maybe Tuddy was right.

136
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:37,054
I knew Paulie didn't want
anyone dying in the building.

137
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:40,891
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

138
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:44,395
What's wrong with you?
l got to toughen this kid up.

139
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,042
It was a glorious time.

140
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,628
And wiseguys were all over the place.

141
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,341
It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...

142
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,427
...decided to take on
a boss and start a war.

143
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:19,221
It was when I met the world.

144
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,266
And it was when
I first met Jimmy Conway.

145
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:28,314
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time, but he was already a legend.

146
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:33,027
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the roomjust went wild.

147
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,946
He'd give a doorman $100
just for opening the door.

148
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,784
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

149
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:43,037
The bartender got $100just
for keeping the ice cubes cold.

150
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,956
The lrishman is here
to take you Guineas' money.

151
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,587
-Want a drink?
-Give me a Seven and Seven.

152
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,347
l'd like you to meet the kid Henry.

153
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,973
How you doin'?

154
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,352
Thank you.

155
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,770
Keep them coming.

156
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,898
Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

157
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:15,403
He was first locked up at 11,
and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.

158
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,031
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

159
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:23,577
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.

160
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,788
He actually enjoyed it.

161
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,334
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in movies.

162
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,545
Give me your wallet.

163
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,843
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.

164
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,053
He was one of the city's biggest hijackers...

165
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:45,016
...of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

166
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,851
Shrimp and lobsters were best.

167
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,269
They went fast.

168
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,273
Almost all of them were gimmies.
Theyjust gave it up, no problem.

169
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,066
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

170
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,359
Help the lady.

171
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,820
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

172
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:01,407
...about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

173
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,993
Thanks, l'll be back for the rest later.

174
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:09,123
Henry, come here.

175
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,542
Say hello to Tommy.

176
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,629
You're gonna be working together, okay?
Help him. Go ahead.

177
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,758
Jimmy, you got anything good?

178
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:23,220
And when the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

179
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,182
He made them partners.

180
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,184
l'd complain, but who'd listen?

181
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,104
-What do you need?
-Two Luckys.

182
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,607
-Here you go, Henry.
-Thanks a lot.

183
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,401
-What do you need?
-One Pall Mall.

184
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,570
What are you doing?

185
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,614
-lt's all right.
-Says who? Your mother?

186
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,240
How many Pall Malls you need?

187
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:46,410
-Where'd you get the cigarettes?
-Get him out of here.

188
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,371
-lt's okay.
-lt's not okay!

189
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:52,166
-You don't understand.
-You don't understand. Store's closed.

190
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,297
-Henry got pinched.
-Where?

191
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:00,257
By the factory.

192
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:04,595
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

193
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,430
Docket #704162.

194
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,726
Yes, sir. That's me.

195
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:16,315
Just stand there. Now stay there.

196
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,532
Counselor, proceed.

197
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:29,620
Congratulations.

198
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,497
Here's your graduation present.

199
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,959
-Why? l got pinched.
-Everyone does, but you did it right.

200
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,962
-You told them nothing.
-l thought you'd be mad.

201
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,256
l'm not mad, l'm proud of you.

202
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,425
You took your first pinch like a man...

203
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,261
...and learned the two greatest things
in life.

204
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,805
Look at me.

205
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,932
Never rat on your friends...

206
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,518
...and always keep your mouth shut.

207
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,148
Here he is!

208
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,525
You broke your cherry!

209
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,117
Congratulations!

210
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:46,530
By the time I grew up,
there was 30 billion a year in cargo...

211
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:51,410
...moving through Idlewild Airport,
and we tried to steal every bit of it.

212
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,080
See, we grew up near the airport.

213
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:58,626
It belonged to Paulie. We had friends
and relatives who worked all over it.

214
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:02,797
They would tip us off about what
was coming in and moving out.

215
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,883
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...

216
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:10,137
...Paulie's union people scared them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

217
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:14,308
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge.

218
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:17,311
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

219
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,855
To us, it was better than Citibank.

220
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,035
You got a phone? Come on!

221
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:37,707
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?

222
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:44,463
There was Jimmy and Tommy...

223
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:45,923
...and me.

224
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,384
And there was Anthony Stabile.

225
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,137
Frankie Carbone.

226
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:56,517
And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.

227
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,812
And his guys, Frankie the Wop...

228
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:03,149
...and Freddy No Nose.

229
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:08,612
And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.

230
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,992
Then you had Nickey Eyes...

231
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,162
...and Mikey Franzese.

232
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,208
Jimmy Two-Times, nicknamed
because he said everything twice.

233
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,919
l'll get the papers, get the papers.

234
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,643
What is this? Coats?
l need suits, Henry, not coats.

235
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,063
Suits are up on Thursday.

236
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:45,316
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll l do with fur coats?

237
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,610
You don't want furs? l'll take them away.

238
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:51,822
No, l want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat.

239
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,909
For us, to live any other way was nuts.

240
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,330
To us, those goody-good people who
worked shittyjobs for bum paychecks...

241
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:03,501
...and took the subway to work and
worried about bills, were dead.

242
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,420
They were suckers. They had no balls.

243
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:09,048
If we wanted something, wejust took it.

244
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:13,552
If anyone complained twice, they got
hit so bad they never complained again.

245
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,348
It was alljust routine.
You didn't even think about it.

246
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,477
Frankie, what the fuck does 520...

247
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,312
...have to do with 469?

248
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:28,359
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

249
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:36,659
Piece of cake. Don't worry about
the alarms. l just got to get a key.

250
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,161
-No problems?
-l'll take care of it.

251
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,297
-Tell him what you were telling me.
-Too good to be true.

252
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:55,678
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

253
00:18:56,554 --> 00:19:00,933
Americans change their money over
into French money and send it back here.

254
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,352
-Calm down.
-lt's beautiful.

255
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,439
lt's totally, totally untraceable.

256
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,817
Our only problem is getting a key,
but l got a plan.

257
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,404
-Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
-Yeah, he's a piece of work.

258
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:17,491
lf l'm right, there could be
half a mil coming in, all cash.

259
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:22,246
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

260
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,792
There's a Jewish holiday Monday. They
won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.

261
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:28,711
What about the security?

262
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:30,171
Security?

263
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:34,925
You're looking at it. lt's a joke.
l'm the midnight-to-eight man.

264
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:38,346
He just comes in like
he's picking up lost baggage.

265
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,973
-lt's beautiful.
-lt won't be a problem at all.

266
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,725
-Good.
-We're on.

267
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:47,271
What's really funny is that
fucking bank job in Secaucus.

268
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,482
l'm in the weeds lying down.

269
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:52,068
He said, "What are you doing?"
l said, "Resting."

270
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,152
"Here?"

271
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:56,364
"This ain't no beach or park."
"l'm resting! " l said.

272
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,284
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

273
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:03,788
"What are you going to tell us?"
l said, "My usual. Nothing."

274
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:08,334
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

275
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,087
l said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

276
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:18,052
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

277
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,598
l'm coming around and who do l see
in front of me?

278
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,810
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

279
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:29,605
l said, "What are you doing here?
l said to go fuck your mother."

280
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,775
l thought he'd shit.

281
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,906
The fuckers. l wish l was big just once.

282
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,954
Funny. You're really funny.

283
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,457
What do you mean, l'm funny?

284
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,502
lt's funny, you know. lt's a good story.

285
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,462
You're a funny guy.

286
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,632
You mean the way l talk? What?

287
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:00,386
lt's just, you know. You're just funny.

288
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,639
You know, the way you tell the story.

289
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,475
Funny how? What's funny about it?

290
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:09,478
-Tommy, you got it all wrong.
-Anthony--

291
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:13,357
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
Funny, how?

292
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,654
Just, you know. You're funny.

293
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:20,823
Let me understand this.

294
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:22,992
Maybe l'm a little fucked up.

295
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,787
But, l'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
l amuse you?

296
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:30,124
l make you laugh?
l'm here to fucking amuse you?

297
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,877
What do you mean, funny?
How am l funny?

298
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,507
You know, how you tell a story.

299
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,553
No, l don't know. You said it.
You said l'm funny.

300
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:46,307
How am l funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

301
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,559
Tell me what's funny!

302
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,108
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

303
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,028
Motherfucker! l almost had him!

304
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:02,031
You stuttering prick, you!

305
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,200
Frankie, was he shaking?

306
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,580
l wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning!

307
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,589
What's with you?
l thought l was getting pinched already.

308
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,093
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?

309
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:25,680
This guy didn't want to give you the check.

310
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,765
Could you take care of this?

311
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,518
No problem. Tell him to put it on my tab.

312
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,645
That's what l want to talk to you about.

313
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,357
lt ain't just this one.
lt's seven big ones you owe me.

314
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:40,611
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
l don't mean to be out of order--

315
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:44,281
lt's good you don't like to be out of order,
Sonny.

316
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:48,369
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like l'm a deadbeat.

317
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:52,123
You're a mutt. You know the money
we spend in this fucking--

318
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,417
-Don't be like that.
-Like what?

319
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,134
Do you believe this prick?

320
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,261
You think this is funny?

321
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:11,225
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

322
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,478
You don't want to bring the check?

323
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,857
Do you believe this prick?

324
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:23,654
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.

325
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:25,448
You're a funny guy.

326
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,992
That's it, Henry!

327
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:33,414
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.

328
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,376
l charged him $7,000.

329
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:42,465
You really are a funny guy.

330
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,804
l'm worried. l'm hearing bad things.

331
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:51,640
He treats me like l'm a fucking fag.

332
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:55,102
l got to go on the lam
to get away from this guy.

333
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:58,356
This ain't right. l can't go here or there.

334
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:01,859
l talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.

335
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:06,113
lf you tell him, he'll stop.
l'll wind up being declared M.l.A.

336
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:08,658
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.

337
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:11,160
You've known this Tommy all your life.

338
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,496
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

339
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:17,541
When l leave my house in the morning
l look over both shoulders.

340
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,795
This is no way to live. l'm no fence jumper.

341
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:24,548
-Tell me what to do, l'll do it.
-What could l do?

342
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:29,845
lf there was something l could do,
l would. l'd like to help you out.

343
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,848
Tell him what we talked about.

344
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:40,856
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. lt'd be good.

345
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:42,733
What are you talking about?

346
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:44,527
You mean the restaurant?

347
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,363
lt's a classy place.

348
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,199
You've been in here a million times.

349
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:54,578
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

350
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:58,332
l don't mean any disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

351
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,460
l'm begging you. What can l say?

352
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:05,006
What am l going to do?
What does he want from me?

353
00:25:05,423 --> 00:25:08,843
l don't know anything about
the restaurant business.

354
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,096
All l know is how to sit down
and order a meal.

355
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,557
Not for you. Just a place to hang.

356
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:19,311
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

357
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,313
What do you want from me?

358
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:25,109
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am l supposed to do? Shoot him?

359
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,319
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

360
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,746
l'm sorry l said that. l didn't mean it.
lt's just that he's scaring me.

361
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,582
l just need help. Help me, please.

362
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:42,668
Know anything about
the restaurant business?

363
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:45,338
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.

364
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:48,716
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

365
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:52,094
You want me to be your partner?

366
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,180
ls that what you're telling me?

367
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:57,641
What do you think l'm talking about?
Paulie, please.

368
00:25:57,892 --> 00:25:59,477
lt's not even fair.

369
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,729
You don't understand.

370
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,899
You run the joint.
Maybe l'll try to help you.

371
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:09,487
God bless you, Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.

372
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:13,824
Now he's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

373
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:16,118
Trouble with a bill, he goes to Paulie.

374
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,621
Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy...

375
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,916
...he calls Paulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie...

376
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,959
...every week no matter what.

377
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:28,172
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me. "

378
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:31,842
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me. "

379
00:26:33,678 --> 00:26:37,682
Also, Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on thejoint's credit.

380
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:40,518
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.

381
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:45,398
Take deliveries at the front door
and sell it out the back at a discount.

382
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,693
Take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.

383
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,487
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

384
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:56,492
Then finally, when there's nothing left...

385
00:26:57,201 --> 00:27:00,705
...when you can't borrow
another buck from the bank...

386
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:04,542
...you bust thejoint out.
You light a match.

387
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,377
Do you need help reaching anything?

388
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,630
You look like you're
decorating a Christmas tree.

389
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,678
She's from the Five Towns.

390
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:17,263
Who?

391
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,099
The Jew broad. Diane.

392
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:26,522
l been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.

393
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:29,066
-No.
-No, what?

394
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:32,528
No, what? Who asked you anything?

395
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,864
Wait to hear what l'm going to say.

396
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,449
All right, what?

397
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:42,955
She won't go out with ltalians alone.
She's prejudiced against ltalians.

398
00:27:43,414 --> 00:27:48,044
You fucking believe that? ln this day
and age? What is this world coming to?

399
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:53,215
l can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against ltalians.

400
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:58,554
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
So you come along for her friend.

401
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,973
See? l knew it. l knew it.

402
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:03,309
What the fuck is wrong with that?

403
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,644
-When is it?
-Tomorrow night.

404
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,271
l'm meeting Tuddy.

405
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:10,107
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.

406
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:12,902
-Why do you always do this?
-Don't give me that shit.

407
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:17,323
What did l ask you for? A favor.
l do a lot of fucking favors for you.

408
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:20,201
l'm trying to bang this broad. Help me out.

409
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,580
l don't understand you. She's beautiful!

410
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:28,209
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

411
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:32,838
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

412
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:35,174
You with your fucking mouth!

413
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,433
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00
and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.

414
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,352
Did you have enough to eat?

415
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:49,563
lt was delicious. l'm just watching my diet.

416
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,399
Let me watch your figure.

417
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:55,736
I couldn't wait to go. I was ordering
dessert when they were eating dinner.

418
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:59,156
When they were having coffee,
I was asking for the check.

419
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,867
Have some coffee. lt'll wake you up.

420
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,121
Joe, can we have the check?

421
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:06,747
What are you doing?

422
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:09,125
-l got to go.
-We just got here.

423
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,751
l got that thing.

424
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,379
We'll leave together.

425
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:17,258
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

426
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,802
I couldn't stand him.

427
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:24,098
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.

428
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:28,602
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

429
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:35,651
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

430
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:39,447
-Ready?
-Lighten up.

431
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,199
We just got here. What are you doing?

432
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:46,537
Before it was time to go,
he was pushing me into the car...

433
00:29:46,704 --> 00:29:49,707
...then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

434
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:54,462
Diane and Tommy made us promise
to meet them again on Friday.

435
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,213
We agreed.

436
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:59,633
But when Friday came around,
Henry stood me up.

437
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:03,304
l feel terrible. l don't know where he is.

438
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:06,474
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.

439
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,934
We were a trio instead of a double date.

440
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,229
He should have called.
l hope it's nothing serious.

441
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:15,274
But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.

442
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:21,364
Tommy, what the fuck?

443
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,116
You got some nerve standing me up.

444
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,160
Nobody does that to me.

445
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:29,580
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some big shot?

446
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,542
l forgot. l thought it was next week.

447
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:37,171
lt was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

448
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:39,715
We can talk about this.

449
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,802
Talk to you after what you just did to me?

450
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:45,096
Forget it.

451
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:49,725
l thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

452
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:54,397
Let me make it up to you.

453
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,023
l'll think about it.

454
00:30:56,107 --> 00:30:59,610
I remember, she was screaming
on the street and I mean loud.

455
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:01,988
-But she looked good.
-l'll think about it.

456
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:04,573
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

457
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:08,202
She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.

458
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:11,998
Hello, Henry.

459
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:13,374
-Ready?
-Yeah.

460
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:14,458
Come on.

461
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,127
-Wait a minute.
-What?

462
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:20,131
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that--

463
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:22,466
Mom.

464
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,510
Meet my friend, Henry Hill.

465
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:28,931
My daughter says you're half Jewish.

466
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:31,767
lt's just the good half.

467
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:34,979
See you later.

468
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,273
You're leaving your car?

469
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,358
He watches the car for me.

470
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,944
lt's easier than leaving it at a garage.

471
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,530
lt's a lot quicker that way.

472
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:55,333
l like going in this way.
lt's better than waiting in line.

473
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:03,132
How are you doin'? What's up?
Here you go.

474
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:13,142
-How are you doin', Gino?
-Good. How are you?

475
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:20,274
Every time l come here,
l see you two. Don't you work?

476
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:14,328
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

477
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:16,539
Anthony, right in the front.

478
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:19,041
Anything you need, let me know.

479
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:39,729
Tony, thanks a lot. l appreciate it.

480
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:49,905
You gave them $20 each.

481
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:53,701
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

482
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,119
-Where?
-Over there.

483
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,704
Thanks a lot, Tony.

484
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:01,751
-What do you do?
-What?

485
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,920
-What do you do?
-l'm in construction.

486
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,884
They don't feel like you're in construction.

487
00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:11,635
l'm a union delegate.

488
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,472
Ladies and gentlemen...

489
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:18,642
...the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of one-liners...

490
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,936
...Henry Youngman.

491
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:31,322
How are you all? l'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

492
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:36,243
l take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

493
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,873
I said, "Where do you wanna go
for our anniversary?"

494
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:43,125
She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before. "

495
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,002
I said, "Try the kitchen. "

496
00:34:46,337 --> 00:34:47,922
Dr. Wellsler is here.

497
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:50,549
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

498
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,551
Gave him another six months.

499
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,722
I love this crowd.

500
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:13,155
Air France made me.

501
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,701
We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

502
00:35:17,368 --> 00:35:20,538
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

503
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:26,627
Sixty thousand.

504
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:29,255
lt's going to be a good summer.

505
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:36,053
l'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

506
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:40,224
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps.

507
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,478
Check, sir.

508
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,192
No. You have to sign for it here.

509
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,737
Should l tip him?

510
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,205
-How are you?
-Okay. And you?

511
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,793
-Henry, this is Bruce.
-Good to meet you.

512
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:13,299
l'll see you around later.

513
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,263
Do you know him?

514
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:20,264
Yeah.

515
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:22,266
He lives across the street.

516
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:27,563
"Roses are red, my love

517
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:31,984
"Violets are blue

518
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:37,073
"Sugar is sweet, my love

519
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:40,242
"But not as sweet as you"

520
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:51,921
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

521
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:55,883
I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

522
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,594
A 21-year-old kid with such connections.

523
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,599
He was an exciting guy.

524
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:07,645
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

525
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:11,273
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

526
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:13,693
He knew how to handle it.

527
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,286
Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.

528
00:37:24,412 --> 00:37:26,455
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

529
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,374
Even underwater.

530
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:32,586
And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested
against hurricane winds.

531
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,424
Forget about money.
You can afford a Morrie wig.

532
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:38,467
Call me now!

533
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:42,388
Come in for a personalized fitting.

534
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:48,728
Morrie, Jimmy's waiting. You're past due.

535
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,730
l've been good to you.

536
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:54,108
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

537
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,485
Jimmy's being a ball breaker.

538
00:37:56,694 --> 00:37:58,654
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

539
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:01,824
l never had to pay
the vigorish he demands.

540
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,285
What am l, a schmuck?

541
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,996
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

542
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,332
l didn't agree to three points above the vig.

543
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:12,418
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?

544
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,962
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go!

545
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:15,838
Fuck him!

546
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,133
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

547
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:20,968
Did l ever bust his balls?

548
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:23,596
l could've dropped a dime a million times.

549
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:26,724
Don't call the cops. You're talking crazy.

550
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:29,685
You got money for that commercial!

551
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:32,271
You don't got my fucking money?

552
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,024
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

553
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:38,653
l'll fucking kill you!
Give me the money, cocksucker.

554
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:40,071
Pay me!

555
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,281
He'll pay, he'll pay.

556
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,410
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.
Jimmy, l'm sorry.

557
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:52,249
You should be sorry. Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

558
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,419
You hear me? Give me the fucking money!

559
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:59,423
l'll give you.... You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

560
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,300
Karen, slow down.

561
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:05,304
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

562
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:07,932
lt's Karen.

563
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:21,946
What happened?

564
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,824
What happened? Are you all right?

565
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:26,701
Who did it?

566
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:31,580
This guy who lives across the street
from me that l've known all my life.

567
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,255
He started to touch me. He grabbed me.

568
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:42,591
l told him to stop. He didn't stop.

569
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,970
l hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

570
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:51,017
He pushed me out of the car.

571
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,276
You sure you're all right?

572
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:07,158
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

573
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:30,222
What do you want, fucko?

574
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:41,525
l swear on my mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

575
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:44,695
Don't shoot.

576
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:07,051
Hide this. Are you all right?
Are you all right?

577
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:13,933
I know there are women...

578
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:17,395
...who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...

579
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:20,439
...gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.

580
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:24,568
I got to admit the truth: It turned me on.

581
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:32,576
Mazel tov!

582
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:08,195
Why don't you be like Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

583
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:11,615
He's settling down now. He's married.

584
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:14,493
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

585
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:18,039
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

586
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:28,591
It was like he had two families.

587
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:32,970
The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.

588
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:36,474
Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.

589
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:39,977
Almost all of them were named
Peter or Paul.

590
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:43,022
It was unbelievable.

591
00:42:43,147 --> 00:42:46,233
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

592
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,820
There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls there...

593
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:51,155
This is Marie.

594
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:53,616
...all married to girls named Marie.

595
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:56,118
She looks ltalian.

596
00:42:57,328 --> 00:42:59,872
And they named all their daughters Marie.

597
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:04,752
And this is Pete. No, l mean Paulie.
l get confused myself.

598
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:08,422
By the time I had met everybody,
I thought I was drunk.

599
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:15,888
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

600
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:19,809
Welcome to the family.

601
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:21,936
Sunday dinner?

602
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:24,313
So beautiful. l want to cry.

603
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:27,483
Here's something to help you get started.

604
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,919
-The bag. The bag.
-What bag?

605
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:51,799
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

606
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,386
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

607
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,835
He didn't call?

608
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:31,922
-He's with his friends.
-What kind of person doesn't call?

609
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:35,343
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

610
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:38,095
A grown-up would get you an apartment.

611
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:41,766
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

612
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:46,270
You're here a month and sometimes l know
he doesn't come home at all.

613
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:48,147
What kind of people are these?

614
00:44:48,272 --> 00:44:51,359
-What do you want me to do?
-What can you do?

615
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:55,446
He's not Jewish. Did you know
what these people were like?

616
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:59,033
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

617
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:02,370
Daddy never went out at all, Ma!
Keep out of it!

618
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,830
You don't know how l feel!

619
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:09,043
How do you feel now? You don't
know where he is or who he's with!

620
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,337
He's with his friends! Dad!

621
00:45:11,629 --> 00:45:14,006
Leave him alone. He's suffered enough.

622
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,842
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

623
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:30,022
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

624
00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:34,819
We were worried! A married man does not
stay out like this!

625
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,115
Normal people don't act like this!

626
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:42,118
What's wrong with you?

627
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,247
You're not normal. She's right!
What's wrong with you?

628
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:49,917
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

629
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:52,294
What kind of people are they?

630
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:58,175
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.

631
00:45:58,426 --> 00:46:01,262
But the first time I realized how different...

632
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,723
...was when Mickey had a hostess party.

633
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:06,809
-Karen, where you from?
-Lawrence.

634
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:09,061
On the lsland. Nice.

635
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:11,480
l'm from Miami. Ever been there?

636
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:15,276
lt's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

637
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:17,737
Stop picking at that.

638
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,655
l'd like to smack his face.

639
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,365
The red-haired guy?

640
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:23,576
The guy's hands are all over me.

641
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:27,705
So l told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or l'll cut them off."

642
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:31,208
She means it.

643
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:35,046
He's lucky. l just mention this to Vinnie--

644
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:38,215
How can you mention it? Vinnie'd kill him.

645
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:42,386
Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard,
then he'll be there for life.

646
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:45,139
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

647
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:48,893
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

648
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:53,147
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears...

649
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:56,233
...she has a heart attack and drops dead.

650
00:46:57,234 --> 00:47:01,530
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

651
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,159
-Jeannie drinks.
-Maybe she's depressed.

652
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:07,995
Give me a break. She's drunk.

653
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:12,249
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

654
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:17,129
They had bad skin and wore too much
makeup. They didn't look very good.

655
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:20,883
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...

656
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,677
...was thrown together and cheap.

657
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,388
A lot ofpantsuits and double-knits.

658
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:29,183
She spends her life in a nightgown.

659
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:31,477
The woman is no angel, believe me.

660
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:33,896
They talked about their rotten kids...

661
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:37,108
...and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.

662
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,318
And the kids still didn't listen.

663
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:42,655
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

664
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,324
l don't know if l could live like that!

665
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:49,704
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

666
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:54,000
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband--

667
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:57,294
Do you know why Jeannie's
husband went to the can?

668
00:47:57,545 --> 00:47:59,755
Because he wanted to get away from her.

669
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,176
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

670
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:07,013
Unless they make themselves get caught.

671
00:48:07,138 --> 00:48:10,808
They don't have things organized.
l know what l'm doing.

672
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:16,689
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

673
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:19,984
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car.

674
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:23,571
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

675
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:33,289
After a while, it got to be all normal.

676
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:36,292
None of it seemed like crimes.

677
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,627
Henry wasjust enterprising.

678
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:42,506
He and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...

679
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,843
...sat on their asses waiting for handouts.

680
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:50,348
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
just blue-collar guys....

681
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:55,311
The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.

682
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:57,980
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

683
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:07,073
Don't fucking move! Don't move!

684
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,085
-See you at the diner.
-l'm riding shotgun.

685
00:49:19,377 --> 00:49:21,671
Did you see him give it right over?

686
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:25,174
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

687
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,180
We were all very close.

688
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:35,226
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

689
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:40,272
Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

690
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:41,607
Police.

691
00:49:41,732 --> 00:49:46,028
l'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

692
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:47,947
Would you read and sign it?

693
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:49,657
Anywhere?

694
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:52,368
We have to go through everything.

695
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,286
You want some coffee?

696
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:56,372
No coffee now, thanks.

697
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:59,917
-Be careful.
-We'll just go about our business.

698
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:02,628
There was always a little harassment.

699
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,756
They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.

700
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,926
They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.

701
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:11,637
But mostly theyjust wanted a handout.

702
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:15,266
A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.

703
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:24,900
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

704
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:28,362
...used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

705
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:31,782
On her own floor!
That never made any sense to me.

706
00:50:32,283 --> 00:50:35,119
It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

707
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:41,834
"Happy birthday to you"

708
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:48,674
We always did everything together
and were always in the same crowd.

709
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:53,304
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

710
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:56,640
The women played cards.

711
00:50:56,724 --> 00:51:00,644
When kids were born, Mickey and
Jimmy were the first at the hospital.

712
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:04,231
When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...

713
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:05,650
...we went together.

714
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:08,611
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

715
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:13,199
I began to be proud that my husband
was willing to risk his neck...

716
00:51:13,741 --> 00:51:15,868
...to get us the little extras.

717
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:19,330
But l got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

718
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:21,707
-Can't do it.
-Why not?

719
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:24,919
l just can't. l got something lined up.

720
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:28,255
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

721
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:32,093
-Pretty please?
-l can't. What do you want me to do?

722
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:35,721
-l got to go.
-Wait a minute.

723
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:38,891
l need money to go shopping.

724
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:40,601
How much?

725
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:45,147
That much.

726
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:51,570
This much. Give me a kiss.

727
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,201
See you later.

728
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:03,958
All right.

729
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:08,212
"I always dreamed the boy I love
would come along

730
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:12,133
"And he'd be tall and handsome,
rich and strong"

731
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,616
Welcome home, Batts.

732
00:52:40,036 --> 00:52:41,746
Hi there. How are you?

733
00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:45,166
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

734
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,377
And give those lrish hoodlums a drink.

735
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:50,379
There's only one lrishman here.

736
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,298
lt's a celebration.

737
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,384
-Top of the morning.
-lt's good to be home.

738
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:01,724
This is my friend Jimmy.

739
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:04,310
Henry. lt's his joint. This is Lisa.

740
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:07,438
Tommy. All dressed up.

741
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,899
All grown up and doing the town.

742
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:13,235
Forgot you were having a party for him.

743
00:53:14,362 --> 00:53:15,696
Come here.

744
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:18,324
l'll say hello. How are you, Billy?

745
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:20,826
l haven't seen you in six years.

746
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:24,330
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

747
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:26,624
Watch the suit.

748
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:29,960
You little prick. l've known you all my life.

749
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:34,215
-Don't get too big on me.
-Just don't bust my balls.

750
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:38,636
lf l was gonna break your balls,
l'd say, "Go get your shine box."

751
00:53:40,805 --> 00:53:42,598
This kid was great.

752
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:45,101
l used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

753
00:53:45,226 --> 00:53:49,230
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

754
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:52,024
He was the best. Made a lot of money.

755
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:56,070
No more shines.

756
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:58,489
No more shines.

757
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:01,409
You been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

758
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:03,536
l don't shine shoes anymore.

759
00:54:04,078 --> 00:54:08,249
Relax. What's got into you?
l'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

760
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:09,583
l'm only kidding with you.

761
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:13,004
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

762
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:15,297
l'm only kidding. We're having a party.

763
00:54:15,423 --> 00:54:19,260
l haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

764
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:21,387
l'm sorry, l didn't mean to offend you.

765
00:54:21,512 --> 00:54:23,097
l'm sorry, too.

766
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:30,813
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

767
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:32,732
Motherfucking mutt!

768
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,984
You fucking piece of shit!

769
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:37,236
Come on, come on!

770
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:41,282
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

771
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,743
You bought your fucking button!

772
00:54:43,868 --> 00:54:46,078
-Don't get nervous.
-You motherfucker!

773
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:49,165
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!

774
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,668
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

775
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:56,297
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

776
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,841
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

777
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:02,553
Teach this kid a little fucking manners!
What's right is right.

778
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:04,930
-You understand what l'm saying?
-lt's alright.

779
00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:09,602
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

780
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:14,398
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

781
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:16,776
-l didn't.
-You insulted him a little.

782
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,862
-l didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
-Okay.

783
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:22,698
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

784
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:24,617
No, have the drink with me.

785
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:28,287
The drinks are on the house.

786
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,249
l fucked kids like that in the can.
ln the ass.

787
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:34,960
Fucking break up my party.

788
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:45,554
You been away for six years.
lt's different now.

789
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,973
l did my fucking time, Jimmy.

790
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:52,436
l came home and l want what l got to get.
l got mouths to feed.

791
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,897
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?

792
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:00,194
Get the door!

793
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:17,670
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

794
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:19,171
Let's shoot him.

795
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:39,025
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

796
00:56:39,317 --> 00:56:41,527
His crew'll be looking for him.

797
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:48,200
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

798
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:52,246
l know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

799
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,124
l didn't want to get blood on your floor.

800
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,713
Go open your trunk.

801
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,720
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

802
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:20,274
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, l don't want to wake her.

803
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:23,903
Look who's here.

804
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,281
What happened?

805
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:30,284
l hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.

806
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:32,411
What happened to him?

807
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:37,291
l haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

808
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,585
You, too. How are you?

809
00:57:39,794 --> 00:57:41,295
Why are you up so late?

810
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:44,465
He came in. You came in.
l'm so happy to see him.

811
00:57:45,591 --> 00:57:49,178
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
l'll make you something to eat.

812
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:52,390
-Go to sleep. We're leaving.
-l can't. Not while he's home.

813
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:54,850
l haven't seen him in so long.
l want to see him.

814
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:55,726
You go inside.

815
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,520
This stuff is like lead.

816
00:57:57,645 --> 00:58:00,648
Tell me, where you been?
l haven't seen you.

817
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:03,985
You haven't called. Where have you been?

818
00:58:04,235 --> 00:58:05,945
l been working nights.

819
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:08,781
And tonight we were out late.

820
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:12,159
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

821
00:58:13,077 --> 00:58:16,414
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

822
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:21,293
lt reminds me, l need this knife.
l'm taking this, okay? Just for a while.

823
00:58:21,669 --> 00:58:23,254
The poor thing.

824
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:26,757
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?

825
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,551
The paw.

826
00:58:29,093 --> 00:58:30,803
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.

827
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:32,555
l got to hack it off.

828
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:35,975
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

829
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:38,060
l'll bring the knife back.

830
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:39,812
Delicious.

831
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:42,898
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

832
00:58:43,024 --> 00:58:44,734
l do, almost every night.

833
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:47,820
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

834
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:52,408
l do, every night. Then l'm free.
l love you! l want to be with you.

835
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:54,201
Settle down.

836
00:58:56,037 --> 00:58:58,080
How's your friend Henry?

837
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:00,207
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

838
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,084
Talk. What are you quiet for?

839
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:04,670
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

840
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:07,173
-l'm just listening.
-Something wrong?

841
00:59:07,298 --> 00:59:10,801
When we were kids,
the compares used to visit each other.

842
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:15,765
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.

843
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:20,311
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

844
00:59:21,312 --> 00:59:25,232
He says, "What am l going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

845
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:28,819
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking! "

846
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:33,532
But in ltalian, it sounds much nicer.

847
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:35,618
-Cornuto contento.
-That's it.

848
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:38,621
lt means he's content to be a jerk.

849
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:41,707
He doesn't care who knows it.

850
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:44,543
Did Tommy tell you about my painting?

851
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,254
Look at this.

852
00:59:47,755 --> 00:59:49,006
lt's beautiful.

853
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:52,176
One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

854
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:54,720
One's facing east, the other west.

855
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:58,933
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got a nice head of white hair.

856
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:00,601
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

857
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:02,478
Looks like someone we know.

858
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:06,732
Without the beard. lt's him.

859
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,611
lt's him.

860
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:21,205
What the fuck is that?

861
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,833
For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

862
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,961
Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

863
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:30,381
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

864
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:34,760
Sometimes, even ifpeople didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

865
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:38,723
Hits became a habit.
Guys would argue over nothing.

866
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,434
Before you knew it, one was dead.

867
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:43,769
They were shooting each other all the time.

868
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:47,440
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.

869
01:00:48,441 --> 01:00:51,235
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

870
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:55,156
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

871
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,410
Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and considered untouchable.

872
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:03,331
Before you touched a made guy,
you needed a good reason.

873
01:01:03,748 --> 01:01:05,791
You had to get an okay...

874
01:01:06,334 --> 01:01:08,377
...or you'd get whacked.

875
01:01:21,182 --> 01:01:23,643
Saturday night was for wives, but...

876
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:26,854
...Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

877
01:01:28,189 --> 01:01:32,568
We saw Sammy Davis, Jr. You got to see
this show. What a performer!

878
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:36,947
He does impersonations.
lt was like the real people!

879
01:01:37,948 --> 01:01:42,119
Unbelievable. You could see how
a white girl could fall for him.

880
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:43,037
What?

881
01:01:43,788 --> 01:01:48,417
Not me. But you could see how some
girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

882
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,336
So you condone that stuff.

883
01:01:50,795 --> 01:01:52,213
Take it easy.

884
01:01:52,505 --> 01:01:55,925
l don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

885
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:57,593
l don't mean me.

886
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:01,764
But, you know, he's got personality.

887
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:03,182
"Personality?"

888
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:07,520
He's talented.
l understand what you're saying.

889
01:02:07,645 --> 01:02:11,148
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

890
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,526
l just said he was talented.

891
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:16,112
Just leave it alone now.

892
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:19,198
He's talented. Leave it at that.

893
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:22,535
"Pretend you don't see her, my heart

894
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:27,540
"Although she is coming

895
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:30,668
"Our way

896
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,297
"Pretend you don't need her

897
01:02:37,091 --> 01:02:38,426
"My heart

898
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:42,638
"But smile and pretend

899
01:02:44,432 --> 01:02:45,808
"To be gay

900
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:50,730
"It's too late for running

901
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:53,941
"My heart

902
01:02:56,277 --> 01:02:58,154
"Chin up if the tears

903
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:01,490
"Start to fall

904
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,828
"Look somewhere above her

905
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:10,082
"Pretend you don't love her

906
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:14,211
"Pretend you don't see her

907
01:03:15,963 --> 01:03:17,214
"At all"

908
01:03:57,672 --> 01:03:59,799
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

909
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,401
What did you hear about that thing?

910
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:20,611
The Brooklyn thing?

911
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:22,321
The guy from downtown.

912
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:24,991
The guy from where Christie lived?

913
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:30,621
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

914
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,748
Know the guy l mean?

915
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:34,458
His name was Batts.

916
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:37,628
His people are driving everyone crazy
looking for him.

917
01:04:37,712 --> 01:04:39,505
Nobody knows what happened.

918
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:43,634
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared.

919
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:48,806
Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

920
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:56,522
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

921
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,946
l want my money.

922
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:06,866
l want my money. He owes it.

923
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,419
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

924
01:05:18,586 --> 01:05:21,505
-Paulie was talking about that.
-We must move it.

925
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:25,009
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

926
01:05:25,259 --> 01:05:28,763
-lt's been six months.
-We got to move it right away.

927
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:45,696
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

928
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,744
-Here's an arm.
-Very funny.

929
01:05:52,036 --> 01:05:53,287
Here's a leg.

930
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:54,789
Here's a wing.

931
01:05:55,790 --> 01:06:00,252
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

932
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:03,089
Oh, that's so bad.

933
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,764
What happened to the car?

934
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:14,016
l hit a skunk, all right?

935
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:15,810
Go with your mother.

936
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,938
lt's disgusting, Henry.

937
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:25,820
I set up Janice in an apartment
near The Suite.

938
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:28,739
That way I was able to stay over
a few nights a week.

939
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:29,907
My new antique lamp.

940
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:33,160
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

941
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:35,287
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

942
01:06:35,413 --> 01:06:36,914
Looks like Roma.

943
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:39,834
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

944
01:06:41,419 --> 01:06:43,045
Come see my bedroom.

945
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:47,925
-Tommy, will you take him?
-l'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

946
01:06:51,804 --> 01:06:53,764
Love that crystal ball or what?

947
01:06:55,433 --> 01:06:58,185
This is where we spend most of our time.

948
01:07:00,104 --> 01:07:02,481
l love the floral arrangements.

949
01:07:05,026 --> 01:07:05,776
French.

950
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,780
Janice and I were having so much fun,
she started screwing up at work.

951
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:11,907
I had to straighten out her boss.

952
01:07:12,033 --> 01:07:14,493
Janice can do what she wants to do!

953
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:16,037
Got it?

954
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:20,249
Just try to run. Hang up once more
and you'll deal with me!

955
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:27,798
Get off of her.

956
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:30,134
You're an animal.

957
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,567
Spider, on your way here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

958
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:52,323
-Did you guys eat?
-l'm starving.

959
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,534
-l'll play these.
-You'll play those?

960
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:57,912
Do l stutter? l play those.

961
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:03,167
What am l? A mirage?

962
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,295
Where's my fucking drink?

963
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:09,215
-You wanted a drink?
-l asked you for one.

964
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:12,218
l thought you said, "l'm all right, Spider."

965
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:15,221
Am l on a pay-no-mind list?

966
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:18,766
No, l heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

967
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:22,687
-l thought it was Henry.
-You're a stuttering fuck.

968
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,314
You said, "l'm all right, Spider."

969
01:08:25,398 --> 01:08:27,191
You ain't all right.

970
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,568
No, you said you were all right.

971
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:32,446
l am all right! You ain't, you prick.

972
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:36,951
You been doing this all night to me,
motherfucker!

973
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:39,829
He wants a drink now? l'll bring it.

974
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:42,790
Get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you prick!

975
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:45,084
You walk like "Stepin Fetchit."

976
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:47,420
For everybody else you run.

977
01:08:47,545 --> 01:08:50,631
Run for me!
Dance the fucking drink back here!

978
01:08:51,632 --> 01:08:53,217
What's that Bogart movie?

979
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,137
-Where he played a cowboy.
-The Oklahoma Kid.

980
01:08:56,429 --> 01:08:59,515
Oklahoma Kid. Shane?
Oklahoma Kid, that's me.

981
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,351
You fucking varmint. Dance!

982
01:09:03,728 --> 01:09:04,979
Yahoo, motherfucker!

983
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:07,356
Round up those fucking wagons.

984
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:15,448
Now he's moving.

985
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,160
Shot in the foot.

986
01:09:19,327 --> 01:09:23,080
He's fine. So he got shot in the foot.
Big fucking deal.

987
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,665
Get a towel.

988
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:26,292
Nice fucking game.

989
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:31,964
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

990
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:34,884
Take him to the doctor down the street.

991
01:09:36,177 --> 01:09:37,887
Bones are all shattered.

992
01:09:38,012 --> 01:09:39,639
Don't get me upset.

993
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:43,017
Don't make a big fucking thing
out of it, Spider!

994
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:46,354
You trying to make me think
what l did here.

995
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:48,314
lt was an accident.

996
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:50,316
Little fucking actor.

997
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:52,610
-You in?
-l'm in.

998
01:09:52,777 --> 01:09:54,737
-Eight hundred.
-Eight hundred?

999
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:59,367
You haven't been home in two weeks!
You're not going out tonight!

1000
01:09:59,617 --> 01:10:02,620
Will you grow up! l'm still going to go out!

1001
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:04,830
Not without your car keys.

1002
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:07,249
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1003
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:09,251
Yes! Something's going on!

1004
01:10:09,543 --> 01:10:12,296
-Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that!
-No!

1005
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,716
l look in your face and l know you're lying!

1006
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,763
-Get out! Get out!
-Shut up!

1007
01:10:20,972 --> 01:10:22,223
Out of my life!

1008
01:10:22,473 --> 01:10:25,142
You're fucked in the head.
lt's in your mind.

1009
01:10:25,309 --> 01:10:27,937
-You're a lousy bastard!
-You got a problem.

1010
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:31,816
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1011
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:34,860
Get out of my life! l can't stand you!

1012
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,790
Spider, what's your rush?

1013
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:52,336
Thank you.

1014
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:56,882
Spider, that bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1015
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:02,346
Next thing you know he'll have
one of these fucking walkers.

1016
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:04,390
But you can still dance.

1017
01:11:04,682 --> 01:11:08,978
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter.

1018
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,981
Tell the truth. You want sympathy.

1019
01:11:12,106 --> 01:11:13,733
Go fuck yourself, Tommy.

1020
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,281
l didn't hear right.

1021
01:11:20,364 --> 01:11:22,158
l can't believe what l heard.

1022
01:11:22,283 --> 01:11:23,617
This is for you.

1023
01:11:24,785 --> 01:11:27,872
l got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.

1024
01:11:28,122 --> 01:11:30,333
Good. Don't take shit from nobody.

1025
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:34,128
He shoots him in the foot and
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1026
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:39,467
Tommy, you going to let this
fucking punk get away with that?

1027
01:11:39,717 --> 01:11:41,594
What's this world coming to?

1028
01:11:46,057 --> 01:11:48,601
That's what the fucking world's coming to.

1029
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:50,686
-How's that?
-What is wrong with you?

1030
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:54,231
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?

1031
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:57,818
l was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?

1032
01:11:58,069 --> 01:12:00,363
How do l know if you're kidding?

1033
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:03,824
l'm kidding with you
and you fucking shoot the guy?

1034
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:05,076
He's dead.

1035
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:08,788
Good shot. l'm a good shot.

1036
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,917
-Hard to miss at this distance.
-You got a problem with what l did?

1037
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:17,004
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1038
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:22,284
Stupid bastard! l can't believe you.

1039
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:25,996
Now you're going to dig the hole.
l got no fucking lime.

1040
01:12:26,247 --> 01:12:30,167
l'll dig the hole. l don't give a fuck.
ls it the first hole l dug?

1041
01:12:30,417 --> 01:12:34,462
Not the first hole l dug.
Where are the shovels?

1042
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:39,397
lt's Karen Hill. l want to talk to you.

1043
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,192
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1044
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,069
I want to talk to you!

1045
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:48,239
You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?

1046
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:52,034
Open the door!

1047
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,121
Answer me!

1048
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,499
l'll tell everyone who walks in here...

1049
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:01,419
...that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1050
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:02,795
Superintendent?

1051
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,631
l want you to know you have a whore...

1052
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,216
...living in 2R!

1053
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,011
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1054
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,848
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!

1055
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:17,810
Wake up, Henry.

1056
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,992
What are you doing?

1057
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,330
Karen, are you crazy?

1058
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:38,915
l am crazy.

1059
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,418
And l'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1060
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,256
Karen, take it easy.

1061
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,012
Do you love her?

1062
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:55,473
Do you?

1063
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,767
Do you?

1064
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,189
l love you. You know l love you.

1065
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,733
You don't.

1066
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,362
No, you don't.

1067
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,698
Be careful, baby. Don't.

1068
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:16,994
But still I couldn't hurt him.
How could I hurt him?

1069
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,789
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1070
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,541
The truth was...

1071
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,793
...no matter how bad I felt...

1072
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,963
...I was still very attracted to him.

1073
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:30,383
Why give him to someone else?

1074
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:32,468
Why should she win?

1075
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,767
Just put it down.
You know l love you, don't you?

1076
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,063
You're all l want, Karen.

1077
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,483
Please put the gun down.

1078
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:50,236
Baby, come on.

1079
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,003
What are you, fucking crazy?

1080
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:11,215
l got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1081
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,385
l got to fucking come home...for this?

1082
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:18,097
l should fucking kill you!

1083
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,267
-How does it feel?
-l'm sorry.

1084
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,769
How does it feel, Karen?

1085
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:42,872
l'm sorry!

1086
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:51,881
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1087
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,676
-Looking good.
-Thank you. Good to see you.

1088
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:59,138
-Hi, Paulie!
-Hi, honey. How are you?

1089
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:01,724
-Go get some cigarettes, okay?
-Sure.

1090
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,561
-Any of you need anything?
-l'm all right.

1091
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,773
-You want anything to drink? A beer?
-No, this....

1092
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,234
-Chinese food?
-No, come on, sit down.

1093
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,076
Karen came to the house.

1094
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,245
She's very upset.

1095
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,497
You got to straighten this out.

1096
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,792
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what she'll do.

1097
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,169
She's hysterical. Very excited.

1098
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:34,298
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1099
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,886
l'm not saying to go back to her right now,
but you got to go back.

1100
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:41,097
You got to keep up appearances.

1101
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,058
The two of them come
to my house every day.

1102
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:45,935
l can't have it.

1103
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:49,397
l can't do it, Henry. l can't do it.

1104
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,692
Nobody says you can't do what you want.

1105
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:56,737
We all know that. This is what it is.
We know what it is.

1106
01:16:57,572 --> 01:17:01,075
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.

1107
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:03,619
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1108
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:06,205
You got to go home. Smarten up.

1109
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,209
l'll talk to Karen.

1110
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:13,754
l'll straighten this out.
l know just what to say to her.

1111
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:19,135
l'll say you'll go back to her
and it'll be like when you first got married.

1112
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,804
You'll romance her. lt'll be beautiful.

1113
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:23,723
l know how to talk to her.

1114
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:27,727
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa
this weekend to pick up something for me.

1115
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:29,478
lnstead, you'll go with Jimmy.

1116
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,063
You come with me.

1117
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:32,899
Have a good time.

1118
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:35,651
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1119
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,487
We'll have a good time.

1120
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:40,198
When you come back,
you'll go back to Karen.

1121
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,992
Please, there's no other way.

1122
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,411
No divorce. We're not animali.

1123
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,539
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1124
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:52,502
She'll kill him, but not divorce him.

1125
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,342
You going to pay us?

1126
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:08,184
Give us the fucking money!

1127
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,310
l can't.

1128
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:13,564
Let's go.

1129
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,617
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.

1130
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,870
Lions? l ain't going near any lions!

1131
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,872
Throw him over the moat.

1132
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,791
l'll get the money!

1133
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:36,712
They must really feed each other to the
lions, 'cause he gave the money right up.

1134
01:18:36,838 --> 01:18:38,214
l'll get the money.

1135
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:41,008
We spent the rest of the weekend
at the track.

1136
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:42,760
They mean business.

1137
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:45,513
Then, I couldn't believe what happened.

1138
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,599
When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

1139
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,686
At first I didn't even know why
we got picked up.

1140
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:54,397
Then I found out the guy we roughed up...

1141
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:57,525
...had a sister working as a typist
for the FBI.

1142
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,528
I couldn't believe it. Of all people.

1143
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:03,781
She gave up everybody.
Jimmy, me. Even her brother.

1144
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,286
It took thejury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

1145
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:11,455
Thejudge gave us ten years,
like he was giving away candy.

1146
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:13,749
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1147
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:16,669
You will now be turned over...

1148
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,838
...to the U.S. Attorney General.

1149
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:26,637
Toast, guys. Good trip,
good life. Get out soon.

1150
01:19:27,722 --> 01:19:29,348
Good trip, sweetheart.

1151
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,353
We'll watch the home front.

1152
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:38,274
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1153
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,944
Motherfuck them every chance you get.

1154
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,661
l'll call you when l get a chance.

1155
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:04,675
Now take me to jail.

1156
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,933
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1157
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:15,853
We had a pasta course,
then we had a meat or a fish.

1158
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:19,190
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt...

1159
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:21,776
...and had a wonderful system for garlic.

1160
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,946
He used a razor and sliced it so thin...

1161
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:28,115
...it would liquefy in the pan
with a little oil.

1162
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:30,159
It was a very good system.

1163
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,995
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1164
01:20:33,371 --> 01:20:34,831
Get that smell?

1165
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:39,210
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
veal, beef, and pork.

1166
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:41,420
You got to have pork.

1167
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:43,756
That's the flavor.

1168
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:47,927
I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.

1169
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:50,513
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.

1170
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:53,099
l didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1171
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:57,687
-There are only three small onions.
-Three onions? How many tomatoes?

1172
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:00,565
-Two big cans.
-You don't need three onions.

1173
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:02,775
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1174
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,736
We had no broiler,
so he did everything in pans.

1175
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:09,157
It smelled up thejoint and
the hacks used to die...

1176
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,284
...but he cooked a great steak.

1177
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:13,995
-How do you like yours?
-Medium rare.

1178
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,956
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1179
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:21,002
When you think ofprison
you get pictures in your mind...

1180
01:21:21,252 --> 01:21:24,922
...of all those old movies with rows
and rows of guys behind bars.

1181
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:27,133
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1182
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:31,262
It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy,
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1183
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:33,139
Give me two steaks.

1184
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:39,729
Everyone else in thejoint was doing
real time, all together, living like pigs.

1185
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:42,773
But we lived alone. We owned thejoint.

1186
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:46,444
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1187
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:47,862
They deserved it.

1188
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:51,616
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
wouldn't rat on the guys we did.

1189
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:54,368
People used to be able
to leave their doors open.

1190
01:21:54,452 --> 01:21:58,206
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.

1191
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:01,709
-We have to take care of that bastard.
-l took care of him.

1192
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:03,252
What'd you bring?

1193
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,129
Some bread.

1194
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:08,007
l got peppers and onions.

1195
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:10,593
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1196
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:11,928
What else?

1197
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:13,513
-Scotch.
-Nice.

1198
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,015
-Red wine.
-Okay.

1199
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:19,101
-Now we can eat.
-Some white, too.

1200
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:23,731
Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.

1201
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:28,986
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1202
01:22:35,743 --> 01:22:37,203
Read 'em and weep.

1203
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:41,457
What are you doing?

1204
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,969
l'll catch you guys later.

1205
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,388
Going for a walk in the park?

1206
01:22:57,849 --> 01:22:59,976
l'll catch you next week. Thanks.

1207
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:06,607
-ls there any more?
-No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1208
01:23:21,873 --> 01:23:23,666
You girls stay right here.

1209
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,419
-Hold hands.
-Go right up front.

1210
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:45,146
What?

1211
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,356
l saw her name on the register.

1212
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:49,525
Want her to visit you?

1213
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:53,070
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing to the parole board.

1214
01:23:53,154 --> 01:23:56,324
What am l doing here?
Where am l? l'm in jail.

1215
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:58,784
l can't stop people from visiting me.

1216
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:02,079
Let her sneak this stuff
in for you every week.

1217
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,500
Let her fight these bastards every week!

1218
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:07,710
Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1219
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:09,253
l'm sorry.

1220
01:24:09,921 --> 01:24:12,131
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1221
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:15,718
Will you stop it?

1222
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:18,054
-Let her do it!
-Stop it!

1223
01:24:26,521 --> 01:24:29,190
Nobody's helping me. l am all alone.

1224
01:24:30,942 --> 01:24:32,985
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1225
01:24:33,444 --> 01:24:36,614
l asked your friend Remo
for the money he owes you.

1226
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:41,828
He told me to take the kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1227
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,830
lt's going to be okay.

1228
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:48,000
l've never seen Paulie since he got out.
l never see anyone.

1229
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:51,462
That's what happens when you go away.

1230
01:24:52,213 --> 01:24:55,883
We're on our own. Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.

1231
01:24:56,467 --> 01:25:00,137
As long as he's on parole
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1232
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:05,309
-l can't do it.
-Yes, you can.

1233
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,937
All l need is for you to bring me this stuff.

1234
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:10,982
A guy in here from Pittsburgh
will help me move it.

1235
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:13,901
ln a month we'll be fine.
We won't need anybody.

1236
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:15,236
l'm afraid.

1237
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:17,196
l'm afraid if Paulie finds out....

1238
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:19,365
He is not helping us out.

1239
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,951
ls he putting any food on the table?

1240
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:25,371
We've got to help each other.

1241
01:25:25,663 --> 01:25:29,083
We got to be really,
really careful while we do it.

1242
01:25:33,504 --> 01:25:35,715
l don't want to hear about her anymore.

1243
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,841
Never.

1244
01:26:05,453 --> 01:26:07,747
-We missed you.
-Are you here to stay?

1245
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:11,542
Did you see our pictures?
l did the one with the house and rainbow.

1246
01:26:11,626 --> 01:26:13,085
l did the sun.

1247
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:16,714
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1248
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:19,592
Do you like the house?

1249
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:24,055
-Get packed. We're moving out.
-With what?

1250
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:27,642
Don't worry.
Just start looking for a new house.

1251
01:26:27,892 --> 01:26:30,978
l got to go to Pittsburgh.
Those guys owe me $15,000.

1252
01:26:31,145 --> 01:26:33,356
We'll be okay. l got things lined up.

1253
01:26:33,481 --> 01:26:36,317
Pittsburgh? You have to see
your parole officer.

1254
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,944
Don't worry about it.

1255
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:41,656
Everything will be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?

1256
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,043
What do you want?

1257
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,546
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1258
01:27:00,091 --> 01:27:03,177
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1259
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:06,973
l don't want any more of that shit.

1260
01:27:07,098 --> 01:27:10,601
-What are you talking about?
-Just stay away from the garbage.

1261
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:13,646
lnside, you did what you had to do.

1262
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:16,774
l'm talking about now. From here and now.

1263
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:20,653
-Why would l get into that?
-Don't make a jerk of me.

1264
01:27:20,778 --> 01:27:22,238
Just don't do it.

1265
01:27:23,114 --> 01:27:24,282
Don't do it.

1266
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,953
l want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.

1267
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:32,290
He's a good earner,
but he takes too many chances.

1268
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,667
l wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.

1269
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:38,546
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.
He's got too much to prove.

1270
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,550
-You got to watch out for them.
-l only use them for certain things.

1271
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:45,469
l ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.

1272
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:50,016
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll
die in prison. l don't need that.

1273
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:54,145
So l'm warning everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1274
01:27:55,146 --> 01:27:59,525
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello
to some fuck who was selling junk.

1275
01:27:59,984 --> 01:28:02,445
That won't happen to me, understand?

1276
01:28:02,737 --> 01:28:05,114
You're out early because l got you a job.

1277
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:06,949
l don't need this heat.

1278
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:09,619
You see anybody with shit you tell me.

1279
01:28:11,245 --> 01:28:12,246
Anybody.

1280
01:28:12,538 --> 01:28:13,915
-All right.
-Yeah?

1281
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:15,791
Yeah. Of course.

1282
01:28:22,757 --> 01:28:26,344
It took me a week of sneaking around
to unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1283
01:28:26,427 --> 01:28:28,930
But when I did, it was a real score.

1284
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:31,933
I used Sandy's place to mix the stuff.

1285
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:37,063
Even with Sandy snorting more than she
mixed, I saw this was a good business.

1286
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,941
I made $12,000 in my second week.

1287
01:28:40,441 --> 01:28:43,694
I had a down payment on my house
and things were rolling.

1288
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:47,281
All I had to do was once in a while
tell Sandy I loved her.

1289
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:53,329
It was perfect.

1290
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:57,959
As long as I got the stuff from Pittsburgh,
Paulie would never find out.

1291
01:28:58,292 --> 01:29:02,046
Within a couple of weeks
it got so big I needed some help.

1292
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:05,299
I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

1293
01:29:05,633 --> 01:29:07,426
lt's fucking great.

1294
01:29:14,475 --> 01:29:16,185
You bring your pay slips?

1295
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:22,024
Four and a half months of dirt.

1296
01:29:22,483 --> 01:29:24,527
-lt's so good.
-l did it.

1297
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:28,322
-Do you love it?
-lt's wonderful.

1298
01:29:29,157 --> 01:29:32,660
This we had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it.

1299
01:29:32,994 --> 01:29:35,496
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1300
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:37,290
Okay, ready?

1301
01:29:37,665 --> 01:29:39,792
Watch the wall with the rock.

1302
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:49,760
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1303
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:57,018
This was imported. lt came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1304
01:29:57,226 --> 01:30:00,479
-Nice, huh?
-Come here. Did you and Jimmy talk?

1305
01:30:00,855 --> 01:30:03,149
He's looking into everything.

1306
01:30:03,357 --> 01:30:06,194
lt'll make the Air France hold
look like peanuts.

1307
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:07,570
Come on.

1308
01:30:07,737 --> 01:30:09,864
-He'll do it, right?
-l told you.

1309
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:13,659
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1310
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:17,663
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.

1311
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:21,542
l've been cultivating this
son of a bitch for two years.

1312
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:25,630
He owes me 20 grand. Once in a lifetime.
l could retire.

1313
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,842
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1314
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:31,469
Let's get a drink.

1315
01:30:31,636 --> 01:30:35,056
These are the guys Jimmy put together
for what turned out to be...

1316
01:30:35,139 --> 01:30:39,101
...the biggest heist in American history.
The Lufthansa heist.

1317
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:44,690
Tommy and Carbone would grab the guard
and make him get us in the front door.

1318
01:30:46,776 --> 01:30:50,029
Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

1319
01:30:50,613 --> 01:30:54,742
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them
tied up and away from the alarms.

1320
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:57,537
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1321
01:30:57,745 --> 01:31:01,415
He used to play guitar at the lounge.
Everybody loved Stacks.

1322
01:31:01,624 --> 01:31:03,835
He was supposed to steal the panel truck...

1323
01:31:03,918 --> 01:31:07,171
...and afterwards compact it
by a friend of ours in Jersey.

1324
01:31:07,296 --> 01:31:09,674
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1325
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:11,843
Have a drink and shut up.

1326
01:31:11,968 --> 01:31:13,845
Just because he set this up...

1327
01:31:13,928 --> 01:31:17,849
...he bugged Jimmy for an advance
on the money we were going to steal.

1328
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:21,727
He didn't mean anything by it.
That'sjust the way he was.

1329
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:32,780
I had everyone working for me.
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.

1330
01:31:35,616 --> 01:31:37,076
Have a good flight?

1331
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,829
l hate Pittsburgh. They're such creeps.

1332
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:41,998
They're not that bad.

1333
01:31:42,999 --> 01:31:44,959
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1334
01:31:45,293 --> 01:31:47,753
ls this the same baby you used last week?

1335
01:31:47,837 --> 01:31:50,923
No, that was my sister's. This is Deirdra's.

1336
01:31:52,008 --> 01:31:53,092
Big yawn.

1337
01:31:53,301 --> 01:31:54,927
She looks like you.

1338
01:31:55,136 --> 01:31:57,513
That's what the stewardess said.

1339
01:32:10,651 --> 01:32:12,111
Take it easy.

1340
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:14,780
Give me a break. You got plenty.

1341
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:18,784
You got all day. Let's make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1342
01:32:19,202 --> 01:32:21,245
-l got to go.
-Where are you going?

1343
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:25,666
Don't start. You know l got to go
do this thing. Where are my keys?

1344
01:32:26,834 --> 01:32:28,002
Over there.

1345
01:32:28,336 --> 01:32:32,089
lt's a mess. lt's like a pig pen.
Why do you think l got you a dishwasher?

1346
01:32:32,215 --> 01:32:33,674
Fucks up my nails.

1347
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:35,635
You got to be smart.

1348
01:32:36,177 --> 01:32:39,180
There's enough powder here
to put us away forever.

1349
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:40,473
Loosen up.

1350
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:42,350
What are you doing?

1351
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:46,896
You don't have to go anywhere.

1352
01:32:47,355 --> 01:32:48,898
Make them wait.

1353
01:32:58,366 --> 01:33:01,953
Nobody knows for sure how much
was taken in the pre-dawn raid...

1354
01:33:02,078 --> 01:33:04,831
...at the Lufthansa cargo terminal
at Kennedy Airport.

1355
01:33:04,914 --> 01:33:08,417
The FBI says $2,000,000,
Port Authority Police say $4,000,000.

1356
01:33:14,048 --> 01:33:15,925
Those sons of bitches!

1357
01:33:16,217 --> 01:33:18,511
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1358
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:22,598
It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest
this town has ever seen.

1359
01:33:24,392 --> 01:33:26,435
Come here, you! Come here!

1360
01:33:27,436 --> 01:33:29,939
Look at this genius. This genius!

1361
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,320
Merry Christmas, Jimmy!

1362
01:33:41,284 --> 01:33:43,578
-Who's this?
-This is my wife.

1363
01:33:45,246 --> 01:33:48,082
Come here. l want to show you something,
Jimmy.

1364
01:33:50,126 --> 01:33:54,755
lsn't she gorgeous? l bought it
for my wife. lt's a coupe. l love that car.

1365
01:33:57,967 --> 01:34:00,803
What did l tell you?
l talked to you, didn't l?

1366
01:34:01,095 --> 01:34:05,057
Didn't l say not to go buy anything
for a while? The fucking car?

1367
01:34:05,308 --> 01:34:09,770
lt's a wedding gift from my mother.
lt's under her name. l just got married.

1368
01:34:10,104 --> 01:34:12,940
-l love that car.
-Excuse me for a second.

1369
01:34:13,274 --> 01:34:15,401
-l just got married.
-Are you nuts?

1370
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:18,404
-Why are you getting excited?
-Are you stupid?

1371
01:34:18,613 --> 01:34:22,033
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.

1372
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,244
lt's under my mother's name.
lt's a wedding gift.

1373
01:34:25,453 --> 01:34:28,456
l don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what l said?

1374
01:34:28,664 --> 01:34:32,627
Don't buy anything. Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?

1375
01:34:33,794 --> 01:34:35,421
What are you getting excited for?

1376
01:34:35,505 --> 01:34:38,508
Because you're going to get us all pinched.

1377
01:34:38,966 --> 01:34:41,636
-What's the matter with you?
-l apologize.

1378
01:34:43,012 --> 01:34:45,473
-l'm sorry.
-What's the matter with you?

1379
01:34:52,522 --> 01:34:53,898
l'm sorry, Jimmy.

1380
01:34:54,941 --> 01:34:56,567
lt's under my mother's name.

1381
01:34:56,651 --> 01:34:59,153
What'd you say? You being a wise guy?

1382
01:34:59,529 --> 01:35:02,532
-l'm sorry. l apologize.
-What did l tell you?

1383
01:35:02,865 --> 01:35:06,035
What did l tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1384
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:07,787
You don't buy anything!

1385
01:35:07,995 --> 01:35:09,455
l'm sorry, Jimmy.

1386
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:14,669
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.

1387
01:35:22,385 --> 01:35:24,762
l can't believe this. Are you stupid?

1388
01:35:24,846 --> 01:35:25,930
Excuse me.

1389
01:35:26,848 --> 01:35:28,558
-Take it off.
-Why?

1390
01:35:30,685 --> 01:35:32,144
Take it off!

1391
01:35:33,563 --> 01:35:37,233
Didn't l tell you not to get anything big
or attract attention?

1392
01:35:37,525 --> 01:35:40,695
One guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1393
01:35:40,903 --> 01:35:42,071
l'll return it.

1394
01:35:42,196 --> 01:35:46,993
Bring it back where you got it. Get it out
of here. Understand? Get it out of here!

1395
01:35:58,254 --> 01:36:01,090
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1396
01:36:02,758 --> 01:36:07,054
l'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody or l'll kill you.

1397
01:36:07,388 --> 01:36:11,350
He's so jealous. lf l even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1398
01:36:11,726 --> 01:36:13,019
That's great.

1399
01:36:13,394 --> 01:36:16,898
l tell them all not to attract attention.
What do they do?

1400
01:36:19,442 --> 01:36:21,986
l've been looking all over for you.

1401
01:36:22,737 --> 01:36:24,780
Listen, l need the money.

1402
01:36:25,406 --> 01:36:28,659
-Morrie, relax, okay? lt's Christmas.
-l need the money.

1403
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:31,454
l'm relaxing. l need the money.

1404
01:36:31,913 --> 01:36:34,582
-l did what l had to do.
-Not tonight, Morrie.

1405
01:36:34,749 --> 01:36:36,959
l did my caper. He owes me.

1406
01:36:37,418 --> 01:36:41,631
Everyone's flashing stuff. They got money.
l'm wearing the same shit.

1407
01:36:41,923 --> 01:36:44,842
They're wearing it. l got to talk to him.

1408
01:36:47,136 --> 01:36:49,430
l got 500 grand coming to me.

1409
01:36:50,431 --> 01:36:52,808
The biggest bundle he made in his life.

1410
01:36:52,934 --> 01:36:55,311
l'll go talk to him. Go have a drink.

1411
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:57,814
-l'll talk to him.
-lt's poison in my eyes.

1412
01:36:57,939 --> 01:37:00,399
-Morris, are you all right?
-No, l'm not.

1413
01:37:07,114 --> 01:37:10,117
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1414
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:14,664
We did it!

1415
01:37:19,961 --> 01:37:21,671
-Who is it?
-lt's me.

1416
01:37:21,963 --> 01:37:23,673
Pete? One second.

1417
01:37:24,507 --> 01:37:28,427
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1418
01:37:29,971 --> 01:37:32,265
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1419
01:37:33,099 --> 01:37:35,768
l got the most expensive tree they had.

1420
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:40,439
-What do you think, Mommy?
-l love them all.

1421
01:37:41,149 --> 01:37:42,859
l love the gold outfit.

1422
01:37:42,942 --> 01:37:44,819
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

1423
01:37:45,945 --> 01:37:47,321
And? And?

1424
01:37:48,114 --> 01:37:49,657
Happy Hanukkah.

1425
01:37:50,491 --> 01:37:53,578
-Very funny.
-Go get yourself something nice.

1426
01:38:02,003 --> 01:38:06,549
Lufthansa should have been
our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.

1427
01:38:07,133 --> 01:38:10,553
Six million in cash.
More than enough to go around.

1428
01:38:20,146 --> 01:38:21,522
Yo, Stacks!

1429
01:38:22,023 --> 01:38:23,274
Open up!

1430
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:34,660
What's with you? He ain't ready.
l knew you wouldn't be ready.

1431
01:38:34,869 --> 01:38:38,039
-You didn't bring any coffee?
-Do l look like a caterer?

1432
01:38:38,164 --> 01:38:40,833
Frankie will make coffee. Make coffee.

1433
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,631
Thought you'd have a bitch in here.

1434
01:38:46,714 --> 01:38:49,008
l did. Where the fuck is she?

1435
01:38:50,051 --> 01:38:53,054
Always got these hot books around
or a bitch.

1436
01:38:53,387 --> 01:38:54,555
What time is it?

1437
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:58,601
-lt's 1 1 :30. We were to be there by 9:00.
-l'll be ready in a minute.

1438
01:38:58,851 --> 01:39:02,438
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own funeral.

1439
01:39:07,568 --> 01:39:11,405
What are you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1440
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:19,330
What the fuck you doing? lt's a joke.
A joke. Put the fucking pot down.

1441
01:39:39,225 --> 01:39:41,269
Stacks was always crazy.

1442
01:39:41,769 --> 01:39:45,439
Instead of getting rid of the truck
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1443
01:39:45,565 --> 01:39:50,111
...went to his girlfriend's, and by the time
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1444
01:39:50,236 --> 01:39:52,280
It was all over the television.

1445
01:39:52,572 --> 01:39:55,408
They even said they got
prints off the wheel.

1446
01:39:56,284 --> 01:39:59,537
It wasjust a matter of time
before they got to Stacks.

1447
01:40:11,424 --> 01:40:13,134
l got to talk to you.

1448
01:40:13,593 --> 01:40:16,262
-Have a drink.
-Have a drink. Come on.

1449
01:40:16,596 --> 01:40:20,641
Have a drink. What are you doing?
lt's an occasion. Have a drink.

1450
01:40:21,934 --> 01:40:23,811
l still have to talk to you.

1451
01:40:25,146 --> 01:40:27,899
-What happened with Stacks?
-Don't worry about that.

1452
01:40:27,982 --> 01:40:31,944
-There's feds all over the place.
-So what? Where are they going to go?

1453
01:40:32,278 --> 01:40:34,405
-lt's in the papers.
-He's worried.

1454
01:40:35,448 --> 01:40:37,241
What are you worried about?

1455
01:40:37,325 --> 01:40:40,828
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1456
01:40:40,995 --> 01:40:44,248
-What are you worried about?
-You worry too much.

1457
01:40:44,665 --> 01:40:47,752
Everything is beautiful.
Didn't you tell him?

1458
01:40:48,127 --> 01:40:49,378
Not yet.

1459
01:40:50,004 --> 01:40:51,464
-What?
-Guess what?

1460
01:40:52,673 --> 01:40:54,467
They are going to make him.

1461
01:40:55,968 --> 01:40:58,095
Paulie's going to make you?

1462
01:40:59,805 --> 01:41:02,642
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1463
01:41:02,808 --> 01:41:05,478
Can you believe that? This Guinea bastard.

1464
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:10,399
He's getting made. We'll work for
this guy one day. He'll be a boss.

1465
01:41:11,984 --> 01:41:13,528
l can't believe it.

1466
01:41:13,653 --> 01:41:15,947
l'm happy for you. Congratulations.

1467
01:41:16,155 --> 01:41:18,199
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1468
01:41:18,658 --> 01:41:21,035
Jimmy, l've been looking all over for you.

1469
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,954
Can l talk to you a second?

1470
01:41:23,162 --> 01:41:26,165
l masterminded the whole thing,
l'm left with dick.

1471
01:41:26,332 --> 01:41:29,836
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! l want my money.

1472
01:41:30,169 --> 01:41:34,215
l want my money! l've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1473
01:41:35,007 --> 01:41:38,177
-Fuck him! l want my money!
-Good. Go tell him.

1474
01:41:40,513 --> 01:41:42,723
Now will you keep you mouth shut?

1475
01:41:44,851 --> 01:41:49,063
Morrie, you'll get your money.
You just got to stop busting balls.

1476
01:41:49,689 --> 01:41:51,315
All right. You hear me?

1477
01:41:51,524 --> 01:41:53,818
Everything's going to be fine.

1478
01:42:03,244 --> 01:42:06,497
''Oh, Henry boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling''

1479
01:42:07,915 --> 01:42:11,169
Half Mick, half Guinea?
l'll sing with an ltalian accent.

1480
01:42:11,419 --> 01:42:15,006
''And down the glen,
the glen and down the mountainside

1481
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:26,017
''The summer's gone

1482
01:42:26,392 --> 01:42:28,436
''And all the roses dying''

1483
01:42:53,419 --> 01:42:56,839
I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1484
01:42:56,923 --> 01:43:00,426
His mind was going in eight
different directions at once.

1485
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:04,847
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1486
01:43:05,306 --> 01:43:06,766
Morrie? Him?

1487
01:43:07,266 --> 01:43:10,186
That's when I knew Jimmy
was going to whack Morrie.

1488
01:43:10,269 --> 01:43:14,899
That's how it happens. That's how fast
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1489
01:43:15,149 --> 01:43:17,527
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1490
01:43:17,777 --> 01:43:21,364
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1491
01:43:21,447 --> 01:43:24,450
Nobody cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1492
01:43:24,992 --> 01:43:27,286
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1493
01:43:27,662 --> 01:43:29,288
-Okay?
-All right.

1494
01:43:31,749 --> 01:43:34,669
Start like this. Sorry.
Did l get you in the eye?

1495
01:43:34,836 --> 01:43:36,629
Stop breaking my balls.

1496
01:43:36,963 --> 01:43:39,173
I wasjust stalling for time.

1497
01:43:39,632 --> 01:43:43,678
I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1498
01:43:43,803 --> 01:43:48,099
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,
I was going along with the program.

1499
01:43:48,349 --> 01:43:51,602
l pulled out his hair. l bit him.
He's out cold.

1500
01:43:53,271 --> 01:43:56,274
l'm enraged.
l wanted to kill this little fuck.

1501
01:43:56,524 --> 01:43:59,193
l walk away. We start to go in this joint.

1502
01:43:59,485 --> 01:44:02,989
l don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's doing this to me.

1503
01:44:03,531 --> 01:44:05,408
l don't want to fucking turn around.

1504
01:44:05,491 --> 01:44:09,787
l don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says, ''Ah....''

1505
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:12,373
l said, ''Don't say it! ''

1506
01:44:17,044 --> 01:44:18,212
''Jerkoff! ''

1507
01:44:21,007 --> 01:44:24,177
What are you going to do? What?
l fucking fly at him!

1508
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:27,930
l got him and l'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1509
01:44:28,014 --> 01:44:32,727
l'm pulling his hair out of his head.
l beat him to a pulp. To a pulp l beat him.

1510
01:44:33,019 --> 01:44:35,938
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
l'm out of breath.

1511
01:44:36,022 --> 01:44:38,399
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1512
01:44:39,567 --> 01:44:41,694
It was a load off my mind.

1513
01:44:42,737 --> 01:44:45,907
He never knew how close he'd come
to getting killed.

1514
01:44:46,073 --> 01:44:49,076
Even if I told him he would
have never believed me.

1515
01:44:51,204 --> 01:44:55,416
-Jimmy, could l talk to you now?
-You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1516
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:58,336
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.

1517
01:44:58,586 --> 01:45:01,172
l've never met a ball buster like you.

1518
01:45:01,547 --> 01:45:03,841
Who loves you more than l do?

1519
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:07,887
-l'd do anything for you.
-Except stop busting my balls.

1520
01:45:08,596 --> 01:45:11,098
-Let's go have coffee.
-Want to go to the diner?

1521
01:45:11,224 --> 01:45:13,434
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1522
01:45:13,559 --> 01:45:17,146
-Which diner?
-Rockaway Boulevard. lt's open 24 hours.

1523
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:19,148
-They got danishes?
-They got everything.

1524
01:45:19,273 --> 01:45:21,943
Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.

1525
01:45:22,568 --> 01:45:26,948
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? lt's terrific. Nunzio--

1526
01:45:34,914 --> 01:45:36,707
l thought he'd never shut up.

1527
01:45:36,791 --> 01:45:38,251
What a pain in the ass.

1528
01:45:38,376 --> 01:45:41,379
-What'll we do with him?
-Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1529
01:45:41,462 --> 01:45:43,339
Call me when you're through.

1530
01:45:43,464 --> 01:45:45,758
-Frank, let's chop him up.
-All right.

1531
01:45:46,259 --> 01:45:49,846
-Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker?
-You said chop him up.

1532
01:45:50,179 --> 01:45:52,139
At Charlie's, not here!

1533
01:45:54,433 --> 01:45:57,019
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1534
01:45:57,145 --> 01:45:59,605
l got a better shot letting him drive.

1535
01:45:59,939 --> 01:46:01,190
The car's cold.

1536
01:46:01,315 --> 01:46:04,652
Get out of here! What, warm it up?
Get out of here!

1537
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:08,281
-Who is it?
-lt's Belle. Open up.

1538
01:46:08,614 --> 01:46:10,575
It's Belle. Let me in.

1539
01:46:10,992 --> 01:46:14,829
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
l know something's happened.

1540
01:46:14,954 --> 01:46:16,247
Calm down.

1541
01:46:16,497 --> 01:46:19,167
He's missing! l know something happened.

1542
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:21,544
He's probably drunk and fell asleep
somewhere.

1543
01:46:21,669 --> 01:46:25,256
ln 27 years he's never been
away all night without calling.

1544
01:46:25,506 --> 01:46:27,967
Something's happened. l know you know.

1545
01:46:28,176 --> 01:46:31,429
Let me get changed.
l'll take you home then look for him.

1546
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:34,348
l've been home! l've been on the phone--

1547
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:36,100
He's playing cards.

1548
01:46:38,644 --> 01:46:41,481
-What'll l tell Belle?
-Who gives a fuck?

1549
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:45,276
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1550
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:47,987
-Watch this.
-Don't fuck with them.

1551
01:46:48,196 --> 01:46:50,072
l'll bust their fucking balls.

1552
01:46:50,156 --> 01:46:52,825
Don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks.

1553
01:46:55,495 --> 01:46:57,872
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1554
01:46:59,207 --> 01:47:00,917
Keep them up all night.

1555
01:47:01,709 --> 01:47:03,169
l'll see you later.

1556
01:47:53,052 --> 01:47:56,389
Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery...

1557
01:47:56,472 --> 01:47:58,683
...but it had nothing to do with me.

1558
01:48:09,402 --> 01:48:12,822
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me
some Christmas money.

1559
01:48:14,407 --> 01:48:16,534
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1560
01:48:16,993 --> 01:48:19,912
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.
It was his.

1561
01:48:20,997 --> 01:48:24,250
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,
but that was it.

1562
01:48:25,418 --> 01:48:28,921
It made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it.

1563
01:48:29,005 --> 01:48:31,841
He'd rather whack them. What did I care?

1564
01:48:32,133 --> 01:48:34,260
I wasn't asking for anything.

1565
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:37,930
And Jimmy was making nice money
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1566
01:48:38,014 --> 01:48:42,226
Still, months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over.

1567
01:49:04,373 --> 01:49:08,419
When they found Carbone
in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff...

1568
01:49:08,669 --> 01:49:12,256
...it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1569
01:49:16,969 --> 01:49:19,263
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1570
01:49:19,555 --> 01:49:22,975
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through Pittsburgh...

1571
01:49:23,059 --> 01:49:26,813
...and even after a while,
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1572
01:49:26,979 --> 01:49:29,106
Jimmy was so happy that morning...

1573
01:49:29,315 --> 01:49:32,318
...because this was the day
Tommy was being made.

1574
01:49:32,652 --> 01:49:36,072
Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

1575
01:49:36,322 --> 01:49:39,075
He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.

1576
01:49:39,325 --> 01:49:43,287
They had a signal set up so he'd know
the minute the ceremony was over.

1577
01:49:43,996 --> 01:49:46,123
-Ma, where are you?
-Here l am.

1578
01:49:46,707 --> 01:49:49,168
-You're home.
-Home? l'm leaving.

1579
01:49:49,919 --> 01:49:52,046
-You look lovely.
-l look good, huh?

1580
01:49:52,338 --> 01:49:55,591
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1581
01:49:56,592 --> 01:50:00,012
l love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1582
01:50:00,096 --> 01:50:01,264
God be with you.

1583
01:50:01,347 --> 01:50:04,100
We always called each other goodfellas.

1584
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:05,977
You'd say to somebody:

1585
01:50:06,227 --> 01:50:10,439
''You'll like this guy. He's all right.
He's a goodfella, one of us. ''

1586
01:50:10,731 --> 01:50:12,108
You understand?

1587
01:50:12,733 --> 01:50:14,944
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1588
01:50:17,613 --> 01:50:20,950
But Jimmy and I could never be made
because we had Irish blood.

1589
01:50:21,033 --> 01:50:23,494
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1590
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:27,665
To become a member of a crew
you must be 100 percent Italian...

1591
01:50:27,957 --> 01:50:31,377
...so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country.

1592
01:50:37,758 --> 01:50:40,428
It's the highest honor they can give you.

1593
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:43,222
It means you belong to
a family and a crew.

1594
01:50:43,556 --> 01:50:46,392
It means nobody can fuck around with you.

1595
01:50:46,726 --> 01:50:51,522
Also, you can fuck around with anybody,
as long as they aren't also a member.

1596
01:50:51,898 --> 01:50:55,485
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.

1597
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,863
How many years since you were made?

1598
01:50:58,988 --> 01:51:01,532
l'm an old-timer. Thirty years ago.

1599
01:51:02,283 --> 01:51:06,829
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1600
01:51:10,082 --> 01:51:13,169
As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made...

1601
01:51:13,252 --> 01:51:15,630
...it was like we were all being made.

1602
01:51:16,422 --> 01:51:19,175
We would now have
one of our own as a member.

1603
01:51:35,191 --> 01:51:37,068
-Who's this?
-This is Vinnie.

1604
01:51:37,151 --> 01:51:39,612
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1605
01:51:39,695 --> 01:51:43,199
We had a problem.
We tried to do everything we could.

1606
01:51:44,033 --> 01:51:48,079
You know what I mean. He's gone,
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1607
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:51,916
What do you mean?

1608
01:51:52,124 --> 01:51:53,835
He's gone. He's gone.

1609
01:51:55,336 --> 01:51:56,420
That's it.

1610
01:52:01,342 --> 01:52:02,510
l knew it!

1611
01:52:03,219 --> 01:52:05,179
l can't fucking believe it.

1612
01:52:15,148 --> 01:52:17,191
-They fucking whacked him.
-Fuck.

1613
01:52:33,875 --> 01:52:35,334
Are you all right?

1614
01:52:42,675 --> 01:52:46,429
It was revenge for Billy Batts,
and a lot of other things.

1615
01:52:47,346 --> 01:52:48,264
That's that.

1616
01:52:48,347 --> 01:52:50,725
There was nothing we could do about it.

1617
01:52:51,267 --> 01:52:55,730
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.
We had to sit still and take it.

1618
01:52:56,397 --> 01:52:59,650
It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball shit.

1619
01:53:12,538 --> 01:53:14,665
They even shot Tommy in the face...

1620
01:53:14,916 --> 01:53:18,586
...so his mother couldn't give him
an open-coffin at the funeral.

1621
01:54:05,466 --> 01:54:08,553
I had a busy day.
I had to drop the guns off at Jimmy's...

1622
01:54:08,678 --> 01:54:10,721
...to match some silencers he had.

1623
01:54:10,847 --> 01:54:13,933
I had to pick up my brother
at the hospital...

1624
01:54:14,183 --> 01:54:16,477
...and pick up some stuff for Lois...

1625
01:54:16,686 --> 01:54:19,689
...to fly down to some customers I had
near Atlanta.

1626
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:34,787
Right away I knew he didn't want them
and I'd be stuck for the money.

1627
01:54:34,871 --> 01:54:39,000
I bought them because he wanted them
and now he didn't want them.

1628
01:54:39,292 --> 01:54:41,961
What good are these? None of them fit.

1629
01:54:42,211 --> 01:54:44,172
l'm not paying for these!

1630
01:54:44,505 --> 01:54:48,259
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was
so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye.

1631
01:54:48,384 --> 01:54:50,845
The drugs are making your mind
into mush!

1632
01:54:51,012 --> 01:54:52,472
l'll take 'em back.

1633
01:55:05,651 --> 01:55:07,778
My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.

1634
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:11,240
Since I would see them in the afternoon,
for a delivery...

1635
01:55:11,657 --> 01:55:14,243
...I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

1636
01:55:33,054 --> 01:55:34,222
Oh, my God.

1637
01:55:35,556 --> 01:55:39,310
At the hospital,
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1638
01:55:40,353 --> 01:55:41,896
What happened to you?

1639
01:55:42,438 --> 01:55:45,441
l almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1640
01:55:45,566 --> 01:55:48,402
And I told him I was partying all night.

1641
01:55:48,945 --> 01:55:49,946
l'm fine.

1642
01:55:50,071 --> 01:55:51,614
Get over here.

1643
01:55:51,864 --> 01:55:53,741
Let me check you out.

1644
01:55:57,703 --> 01:55:59,997
He took mercy on me, gave me Valium...

1645
01:56:00,289 --> 01:56:02,083
...and sent me home.

1646
01:56:02,375 --> 01:56:06,337
My plan was to drop off my brother
at the house and pick up Karen.

1647
01:56:08,047 --> 01:56:11,300
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1648
01:56:12,051 --> 01:56:15,138
Right up there.
l think it's been following me all morning.

1649
01:56:15,221 --> 01:56:18,141
-Get the fuck out. Are you nuts?
-l'm telling you.

1650
01:56:18,224 --> 01:56:21,561
lt's the third time l've seen it.
At the hospital l saw it.

1651
01:56:21,894 --> 01:56:24,814
l had to make some stops.
l've seen it every time.

1652
01:56:24,939 --> 01:56:28,025
l've been all over town
and l've seen it all day.

1653
01:56:34,615 --> 01:56:36,492
I was cooking dinner that night.

1654
01:56:36,617 --> 01:56:41,080
I had to start braising the beef
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1655
01:56:43,749 --> 01:56:47,003
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with gravy...

1656
01:56:47,086 --> 01:56:48,880
...roasted peppers...

1657
01:56:49,130 --> 01:56:52,800
...string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets...

1658
01:56:53,634 --> 01:56:55,178
...that were cutjust right...

1659
01:56:55,261 --> 01:56:58,264
...that I was going to fry up
as an appetizer.

1660
01:56:58,347 --> 01:57:00,391
So I was home for about an hour.

1661
01:57:00,516 --> 01:57:04,896
My plan was to start dinner early so I
could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.

1662
01:57:05,146 --> 01:57:09,358
Then get the package for Lois
to take to Atlanta later that night.

1663
01:57:10,526 --> 01:57:14,280
I kept looking out the window
and saw that the helicopter was gone.

1664
01:57:14,614 --> 01:57:16,407
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.

1665
01:57:16,532 --> 01:57:18,993
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1666
01:57:19,285 --> 01:57:23,581
I asked my brother to watch the sauce,
and Karen and I started out.

1667
01:57:25,791 --> 01:57:27,585
Oh, God. l see it.

1668
01:57:28,461 --> 01:57:30,421
-Look, it's right there.
-Damn!

1669
01:57:32,131 --> 01:57:33,216
That's it.

1670
01:57:33,382 --> 01:57:35,510
We got to get to your mother's.

1671
01:57:35,885 --> 01:57:37,053
See, l told you.

1672
01:57:37,178 --> 01:57:38,554
lt's funny.

1673
01:57:39,138 --> 01:57:42,642
-lt's not the end of the world.
-We're going to your mother's.

1674
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:14,340
Tell your mother not to touch anything
outside of the house. Nothing.

1675
01:58:14,423 --> 01:58:17,343
Why didn't you go to your mother's house?

1676
01:58:18,427 --> 01:58:21,514
''Everything's gonna be all right
this morning''

1677
01:58:22,598 --> 01:58:24,058
Let's go shopping.

1678
01:58:27,228 --> 01:58:30,815
No, l'm not nuts,
it's been following me all fucking morning!

1679
01:58:34,235 --> 01:58:36,279
Alright. He thinks l'm paranoid!

1680
01:58:36,362 --> 01:58:40,408
l should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid l am.

1681
01:58:41,617 --> 01:58:43,578
Come on, let's go inside.

1682
01:58:47,623 --> 01:58:48,916
Yeah, it's gone.

1683
01:58:49,208 --> 01:58:52,378
-l don't hear anything.
-Let's go back to your mother's.

1684
01:59:05,558 --> 01:59:07,518
-They all right?
-They're great.

1685
01:59:07,768 --> 01:59:11,105
Didn't l say you were paranoid?
Didn't l tell him?

1686
01:59:11,481 --> 01:59:13,107
Yeah. l need a hit.

1687
01:59:13,483 --> 01:59:16,652
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, l'll show you helicopters.

1688
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:19,739
l've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1689
01:59:20,573 --> 01:59:24,869
I had to get home and get the package
ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1690
01:59:25,161 --> 01:59:29,123
Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give
the package a whack with quinine.

1691
01:59:29,290 --> 01:59:31,667
Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1692
01:59:31,792 --> 01:59:35,379
I had the cooking to finish,
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1693
01:59:35,505 --> 01:59:39,008
-lt's Sandy. What the fuck is this?
-She's a pain in the ass.

1694
01:59:39,592 --> 01:59:41,719
-When are you coming over?
-ln an hour.

1695
01:59:41,803 --> 01:59:45,056
-You staying tonight, right?
-l can't. l got my brother tonight.

1696
01:59:45,181 --> 01:59:49,310
Come on, stop. Stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Good-bye.

1697
01:59:56,901 --> 01:59:58,778
-Hello?
-It's me. You ready?

1698
01:59:59,946 --> 02:00:02,406
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.

1699
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:06,619
-Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
-l'm stirring it.

1700
02:00:06,828 --> 02:00:09,205
-Listen, you know what to do?
-Yeah, yeah.

1701
02:00:09,288 --> 02:00:11,666
Don't ''yeah, yeah'' me, Lois!
This is important.

1702
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:14,544
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1703
02:00:14,627 --> 02:00:17,547
Understand me? Call from an outside line.
l mean it!

1704
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:20,967
Jesus, you must think l'm dumb.
l know what to do.

1705
02:00:21,634 --> 02:00:24,011
You little hick, just make sure you do it!

1706
02:00:24,137 --> 02:00:25,221
You're a pain.

1707
02:00:25,346 --> 02:00:27,390
-Hey! Just do it!
-Okay.

1708
02:00:30,059 --> 02:00:34,355
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1709
02:00:35,857 --> 02:00:37,900
-What'd he say?
-Nothing.

1710
02:00:38,317 --> 02:00:40,528
What does she do after she hangs up?

1711
02:00:40,653 --> 02:00:44,490
After everything I told her?
After all her ''yeah, yeah'' bullshit?

1712
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:49,453
She calls from the house. If anyone
was listening they'd know everything.

1713
02:00:49,745 --> 02:00:54,542
They'd know a package was leaving my
house and they'd have the flight number.

1714
02:00:55,585 --> 02:00:58,504
As soon as I got home, I started cooking.

1715
02:00:58,671 --> 02:01:00,965
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1716
02:01:01,257 --> 02:01:03,384
I told my brother to watch on the stove.

1717
02:01:03,509 --> 02:01:07,472
All day long the poor guy's been
watching helicopters and tomato sauce.

1718
02:01:08,097 --> 02:01:12,560
I had to drive over to Sandy's,
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1719
02:01:23,905 --> 02:01:26,908
Do you think you can come over,
fuck me, then leave?

1720
02:01:27,909 --> 02:01:31,829
-Got someplace better to go?
-Don't talk like that. Come on.

1721
02:01:32,205 --> 02:01:33,998
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1722
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:35,541
You believe me?

1723
02:01:37,043 --> 02:01:38,753
Do you believe me?

1724
02:01:41,714 --> 02:01:43,508
-That's the last one?
-Yeah.

1725
02:01:52,725 --> 02:01:55,102
You lying son of a bitch! l hate you!

1726
02:02:02,151 --> 02:02:05,071
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1727
02:02:05,321 --> 02:02:08,241
...from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1728
02:02:08,741 --> 02:02:11,035
-l have to.
-You don't have to.

1729
02:02:15,832 --> 02:02:17,208
l got to go home.

1730
02:02:19,335 --> 02:02:21,212
What do you mean you got to go home?

1731
02:02:21,337 --> 02:02:25,091
We got to tape this stuff to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1732
02:02:25,716 --> 02:02:27,844
l got to go home and get my hat.

1733
02:02:28,427 --> 02:02:31,097
Forget your fucking hat!
Are you kidding me?

1734
02:02:31,347 --> 02:02:34,433
l need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1735
02:02:34,517 --> 02:02:38,020
l got to have it. lt's my lucky hat.
l never fly without it.

1736
02:02:39,981 --> 02:02:42,567
Do you understand
what we are involved in?

1737
02:02:42,859 --> 02:02:46,112
l don't care. l need my hat.
l won't fly without it.

1738
02:02:50,992 --> 02:02:54,829
What could I do if she insisted
I drive her home for her damn hat?

1739
02:02:55,121 --> 02:02:57,790
I hid the package and
went to take her home.

1740
02:02:57,874 --> 02:02:58,791
A hat?

1741
02:03:07,884 --> 02:03:09,427
What the fuck is this?

1742
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:12,096
Police! Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!

1743
02:03:12,305 --> 02:03:15,308
l'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!

1744
02:03:19,228 --> 02:03:23,858
I thought I was dead, but when I
heard all the noise I knew they were cops.

1745
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:25,776
Only cops talk that way.

1746
02:03:26,027 --> 02:03:27,403
Don't fucking move.

1747
02:03:27,528 --> 02:03:31,282
If they had been wiseguys,
I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1748
02:03:31,657 --> 02:03:33,284
I would have been dead.

1749
02:03:34,243 --> 02:03:36,204
Michael! Lock the door!

1750
02:04:00,019 --> 02:04:04,732
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar? l'm talking to you.

1751
02:04:05,107 --> 02:04:08,861
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. l don't give a fuck.

1752
02:04:08,945 --> 02:04:12,907
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1753
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:16,118
All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter...

1754
02:04:16,285 --> 02:04:20,164
...were local cops busting my balls over
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1755
02:04:20,289 --> 02:04:21,582
Just get the lawyer.

1756
02:04:21,707 --> 02:04:24,961
They'd been on me a month.
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1757
02:04:25,044 --> 02:04:27,797
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1758
02:04:27,922 --> 02:04:31,509
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a fucking problem all night.

1759
02:04:31,634 --> 02:04:35,513
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1760
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:39,892
25 fucking years, pal.
l'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1761
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:43,688
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1762
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:48,401
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1763
02:04:48,734 --> 02:04:50,945
You got anything good in there?

1764
02:04:52,572 --> 02:04:53,948
ls it good?

1765
02:04:58,828 --> 02:05:00,538
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1766
02:05:03,499 --> 02:05:05,126
See you in Attica, dick.

1767
02:05:05,668 --> 02:05:09,088
l spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1768
02:05:09,505 --> 02:05:12,758
He wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1769
02:05:12,842 --> 02:05:14,469
Fuck Jimmy and his money!

1770
02:05:14,594 --> 02:05:18,181
l got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or l'm dead.

1771
02:05:18,514 --> 02:05:20,558
Then you're better off staying in here.

1772
02:05:20,683 --> 02:05:25,480
They could whack me in here as easy as
outside. They're afraid l'll rat them out.

1773
02:05:25,771 --> 02:05:30,318
People are already walking away from me.
l'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1774
02:05:30,485 --> 02:05:34,697
Karen finally got her mother to put
her house up for my bail and I was out.

1775
02:05:34,864 --> 02:05:39,160
I remember I had this feeling I would be
killed right outside thejail.

1776
02:05:39,494 --> 02:05:42,914
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me
and he's such a hothead.

1777
02:05:42,997 --> 02:05:44,790
And I was worried about Jimmy.

1778
02:05:44,874 --> 02:05:49,337
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out
he was in the drug deals with me...

1779
02:05:49,795 --> 02:05:53,132
...Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

1780
02:05:54,383 --> 02:05:56,260
This is the bad time.

1781
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,806
I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1782
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:04,977
Now my plan was to stay alive
long enough to sell off the dope...

1783
02:06:05,228 --> 02:06:09,690
...the cops never found, then disappear
until things got straightened out.

1784
02:06:11,567 --> 02:06:14,237
Fuck! Where's the stuff l left, Karen?

1785
02:06:14,529 --> 02:06:16,489
l flushed it down the toilet.

1786
02:06:17,740 --> 02:06:18,658
What?

1787
02:06:19,742 --> 02:06:21,869
What was l supposed to do?

1788
02:06:22,411 --> 02:06:26,165
That was worth $60,000!
l need that money! That's all we got!

1789
02:06:26,707 --> 02:06:28,835
They had a search warrant!

1790
02:06:29,544 --> 02:06:34,006
That's all the money we had! l was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1791
02:06:34,257 --> 02:06:36,926
l had to! They were going to find it!

1792
02:06:37,176 --> 02:06:40,930
-They wouldn't have found it!
-They would have! l swear!

1793
02:06:42,056 --> 02:06:44,016
They would've found it!

1794
02:06:45,852 --> 02:06:47,395
Why did you do that?

1795
02:06:47,854 --> 02:06:51,107
-They would have found it.
-Why did you do that?

1796
02:06:52,567 --> 02:06:53,943
Oh, my God!

1797
02:06:54,610 --> 02:06:56,821
-l had to do it.
-Oh, my God!

1798
02:07:33,608 --> 02:07:35,651
Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1799
02:07:38,237 --> 02:07:41,407
l don't know what else to say.
l know l fucked up.

1800
02:07:41,657 --> 02:07:43,117
Yeah, you fucked up.

1801
02:07:46,662 --> 02:07:48,539
But l'm all right now.

1802
02:07:50,249 --> 02:07:53,920
l can be trusted now. l'm clean.
On my kids, l'm clean.

1803
02:07:54,629 --> 02:07:57,131
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1804
02:07:58,132 --> 02:08:02,178
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like l was never nothing to you.

1805
02:08:02,428 --> 02:08:05,264
After what you said,
l couldn't come to you.

1806
02:08:06,516 --> 02:08:08,559
You know, l was ashamed.

1807
02:08:11,854 --> 02:08:13,481
l'm ashamed now.

1808
02:08:17,193 --> 02:08:19,487
But l got nowhere else to go.

1809
02:08:22,698 --> 02:08:27,078
You're all l got. And l really,
really need your help. l really do.

1810
02:08:33,042 --> 02:08:34,126
Take this.

1811
02:08:49,225 --> 02:08:51,686
And now l've got to turn my back on you.

1812
02:09:01,821 --> 02:09:03,531
Thirty-two hundred bucks.

1813
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:07,076
That's what he gave me.
$3,200 for a lifetime.

1814
02:09:08,744 --> 02:09:11,414
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.

1815
02:09:11,497 --> 02:09:13,875
-We got to get out.
-I don't want to run.

1816
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,753
Am l supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1817
02:09:18,337 --> 02:09:20,381
l don't want to do that.

1818
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:24,719
lf we stay around here we're dead.
You got it? We' re dead.

1819
02:09:26,512 --> 02:09:31,225
They're right. You took too much
of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

1820
02:09:34,604 --> 02:09:36,147
How's he doing?

1821
02:09:36,731 --> 02:09:37,982
He's okay.

1822
02:09:38,608 --> 02:09:40,234
They sobered him up.

1823
02:09:40,526 --> 02:09:42,487
Good. Glad to hear it.

1824
02:09:46,782 --> 02:09:50,036
-What kind of questions they been asking?
-l don't know.

1825
02:09:51,746 --> 02:09:55,333
l got my mind on so many other things.
l got no money.

1826
02:09:55,875 --> 02:09:58,628
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1827
02:09:58,753 --> 02:10:00,713
Tell him he's got to call me.

1828
02:10:01,464 --> 02:10:05,218
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. lt's important.

1829
02:10:05,468 --> 02:10:08,971
He doesn't know l came here to see you.
lt's like he's crazy.

1830
02:10:09,263 --> 02:10:12,266
-Take this. lt's a couple thousand.
-Thanks, Jimmy.

1831
02:10:12,475 --> 02:10:14,769
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1832
02:10:14,894 --> 02:10:18,064
l got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1833
02:10:18,147 --> 02:10:20,024
Pick out a few for yourself.

1834
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:22,860
-For my mom.
-Yeah, whatever.

1835
02:10:23,152 --> 02:10:25,530
Not here. ln the store on the corner.

1836
02:10:25,822 --> 02:10:28,366
lt's swag, so l got it down on the corner.

1837
02:10:34,288 --> 02:10:36,165
Go ahead, sweetheart, l'll see you.

1838
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:37,834
-Thanks.
-Don't worry.

1839
02:10:38,084 --> 02:10:40,461
-l'll try.
-He's got to call me.

1840
02:10:43,297 --> 02:10:44,382
Over here?

1841
02:10:44,590 --> 02:10:45,967
Right down there.

1842
02:11:00,606 --> 02:11:02,650
lt's over there, on the corner.

1843
02:11:02,942 --> 02:11:04,110
Right there.

1844
02:11:37,894 --> 02:11:40,354
No! Go ahead! lt's right there!

1845
02:11:40,646 --> 02:11:42,773
No, Jimmy! l'm in a hurry!

1846
02:11:43,065 --> 02:11:45,902
My mom's watching the kids!
l got to get home!

1847
02:11:46,152 --> 02:11:47,862
l'll come back later!

1848
02:12:16,182 --> 02:12:17,558
What happened?

1849
02:12:18,434 --> 02:12:19,685
Nothing.

1850
02:12:20,102 --> 02:12:22,605
-What happened?
-l just got scared.

1851
02:12:25,525 --> 02:12:26,984
Got the keys?

1852
02:12:28,361 --> 02:12:29,570
What happened?

1853
02:12:29,779 --> 02:12:32,073
l just got scared. lt's okay.

1854
02:12:32,281 --> 02:12:33,741
Are you all right?

1855
02:12:40,706 --> 02:12:44,752
Ifyou're part of a crew nobody ever
tells you they're going to kill you.

1856
02:12:45,711 --> 02:12:47,505
It doesn't happen that way.

1857
02:12:47,797 --> 02:12:51,134
There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

1858
02:12:51,384 --> 02:12:55,221
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.

1859
02:12:55,638 --> 02:12:57,765
People who cared for you all your life.

1860
02:12:57,890 --> 02:13:02,520
They always seem to come when you're
weakest and most in need of their help.

1861
02:13:02,812 --> 02:13:05,898
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place
we both knew.

1862
02:13:06,149 --> 02:13:09,902
I got there 15 minutes early
and Jimmy was already there.

1863
02:13:10,570 --> 02:13:15,116
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up.

1864
02:13:15,491 --> 02:13:17,869
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1865
02:13:18,161 --> 02:13:21,080
He wasjumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1866
02:13:21,998 --> 02:13:25,084
On the surface,
everything was supposed to be fine.

1867
02:13:25,334 --> 02:13:27,712
We were supposed to be discussing
my case.

1868
02:13:27,837 --> 02:13:32,633
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1869
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:37,930
l been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1870
02:13:38,181 --> 02:13:39,724
Now you understand?

1871
02:13:42,518 --> 02:13:46,105
lt's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat this case.

1872
02:13:49,192 --> 02:13:53,488
Well, you know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1873
02:13:56,115 --> 02:14:00,745
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon
as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1874
02:14:02,705 --> 02:14:05,374
l know where he is. He's hiding out.

1875
02:14:06,542 --> 02:14:08,085
Know what l'm saying?

1876
02:14:12,965 --> 02:14:16,636
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1877
02:14:19,222 --> 02:14:20,765
No, not at all.

1878
02:14:22,141 --> 02:14:23,935
That way they got nothing.

1879
02:14:32,652 --> 02:14:35,655
Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

1880
02:14:35,905 --> 02:14:40,034
But now he's asking me to go to Florida
and do a hit with Anthony.

1881
02:14:46,999 --> 02:14:51,045
That's when I knew I would never
have come back from Florida alive.

1882
02:15:04,183 --> 02:15:07,687
Wherever you move me,
l asked once and l'll tell you again...

1883
02:15:07,854 --> 02:15:10,148
...l don't want to go any place cold.

1884
02:15:11,023 --> 02:15:12,817
You don't have a choice.

1885
02:15:13,609 --> 02:15:16,445
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1886
02:15:16,946 --> 02:15:19,407
...just no place cold. Do that for me.

1887
02:15:19,699 --> 02:15:21,742
He's bronchial, that's why.

1888
02:15:22,034 --> 02:15:24,495
lf he's bronchial we'll consider that.

1889
02:15:24,704 --> 02:15:26,581
l'd like to go someplace not cold.

1890
02:15:26,706 --> 02:15:30,126
Can l ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1891
02:15:31,669 --> 02:15:32,753
What about them?

1892
02:15:32,879 --> 02:15:36,299
Am l going to see them?
Am l going to talk to them?

1893
02:15:36,549 --> 02:15:39,135
Don't l have some kind of contact
with them?

1894
02:15:39,552 --> 02:15:40,553
No.

1895
02:15:41,721 --> 02:15:45,224
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...

1896
02:15:45,475 --> 02:15:49,604
...if something happens to my parents
and they get sick, l can't see them?

1897
02:15:49,729 --> 02:15:52,732
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick.

1898
02:15:52,982 --> 02:15:55,651
lf there's extraordinary circumstances--

1899
02:15:55,902 --> 02:15:58,821
l can't do this. l can't do this, Henry.

1900
02:15:59,489 --> 02:16:01,532
l can't leave my parents.

1901
02:16:02,909 --> 02:16:04,952
Karen, l told you before.

1902
02:16:05,912 --> 02:16:09,415
l'm not going to do this unless
you and the kids come with me.

1903
02:16:11,167 --> 02:16:13,211
l can't do it without you.

1904
02:16:13,503 --> 02:16:16,088
So you do whatever, but...that's it.

1905
02:16:18,925 --> 02:16:21,594
-You need Henry, not me, right?
-That's right.

1906
02:16:21,844 --> 02:16:23,971
l don't care whether you go or not.

1907
02:16:24,597 --> 02:16:28,017
lf it'll make him a better witness,
l want you with him.

1908
02:16:28,267 --> 02:16:29,811
They don't want me.

1909
02:16:29,936 --> 02:16:33,606
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

1910
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:37,276
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

1911
02:16:37,443 --> 02:16:40,112
lf he goes into the program
you're in danger.

1912
02:16:40,279 --> 02:16:42,573
-l don't know anything.
-Don't give me...

1913
02:16:42,698 --> 02:16:44,242
...the babe-in-the-woods routine.

1914
02:16:44,367 --> 02:16:48,663
l've listened to those wiretaps
and l've heard you talk about cocaine.

1915
02:16:48,955 --> 02:16:52,834
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

1916
02:16:57,463 --> 02:17:00,216
lt doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

1917
02:17:00,383 --> 02:17:03,136
...or stays on the streets, he's a dead man.

1918
02:17:03,719 --> 02:17:05,596
He knows it and you know it.

1919
02:17:06,973 --> 02:17:09,350
What about the kids and school?

1920
02:17:09,809 --> 02:17:11,352
l mean, what goes on?

1921
02:17:12,145 --> 02:17:14,188
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

1922
02:17:14,313 --> 02:17:16,691
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

1923
02:17:16,816 --> 02:17:20,236
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

1924
02:17:20,653 --> 02:17:24,490
We'll save your life, his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

1925
02:17:27,743 --> 02:17:30,830
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

1926
02:17:30,913 --> 02:17:33,291
It was easy for us to disappear.

1927
02:17:33,583 --> 02:17:37,879
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.

1928
02:17:38,087 --> 02:17:41,507
My Social Security cards
and driver's licenses were phonies.

1929
02:17:41,757 --> 02:17:43,968
I never voted or paid taxes.

1930
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:48,890
My birth certificate and arrest sheet
were all that showed I was alive.

1931
02:17:49,098 --> 02:17:51,767
-Do you see him here in this courtroom?
-Yes.

1932
02:17:52,101 --> 02:17:55,021
Will you please point him out for the jury?

1933
02:17:57,106 --> 02:18:01,652
Let the record show that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

1934
02:18:03,362 --> 02:18:05,823
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

1935
02:18:06,115 --> 02:18:08,409
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.

1936
02:18:08,701 --> 02:18:11,162
Can you point him out for the jury?

1937
02:18:12,038 --> 02:18:16,250
Let the record show Mr. Hill
identified the defendant Paul Cicero.

1938
02:18:18,127 --> 02:18:19,754
l have a document....

1939
02:18:20,046 --> 02:18:22,799
The hardest thing was leaving the life.

1940
02:18:23,382 --> 02:18:25,092
I still loved the life.

1941
02:18:25,218 --> 02:18:29,138
We were treated like movie stars
with muscle. We had it all.

1942
02:18:29,722 --> 02:18:32,892
Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

1943
02:18:33,309 --> 02:18:36,729
I had paper bags filled withjewelry
stashed in the kitchen.

1944
02:18:36,813 --> 02:18:38,940
I had a bowl of coke next to my bed.

1945
02:18:39,065 --> 02:18:42,902
People call them rats because
they will do anything to survive.

1946
02:18:43,069 --> 02:18:44,946
-Objection!
-Objection sustained.

1947
02:18:45,071 --> 02:18:48,950
-l know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it!

1948
02:18:50,743 --> 02:18:53,120
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

1949
02:18:53,246 --> 02:18:56,666
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideouts
all over the city.

1950
02:18:56,916 --> 02:18:59,418
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend...

1951
02:18:59,669 --> 02:19:03,714
...then blow the winnings in a week
or go to sharks to pay the bookies.

1952
02:19:04,006 --> 02:19:05,383
Didn't matter.

1953
02:19:05,758 --> 02:19:10,054
lt didn't mean anything. When l was broke
l would go rob some more.

1954
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:12,640
We ran everything.

1955
02:19:13,015 --> 02:19:16,853
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

1956
02:19:17,436 --> 02:19:21,357
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

1957
02:19:22,942 --> 02:19:24,652
And now it's all over.

1958
02:19:25,278 --> 02:19:27,321
That's the hardest part.

1959
02:19:28,114 --> 02:19:29,907
Today everything is different.

1960
02:19:30,032 --> 02:19:33,911
There's no action. I have to wait around
like everyone else.

1961
02:19:34,453 --> 02:19:36,497
Can't even get decent food.

1962
02:19:36,789 --> 02:19:40,126
After I got here I ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce...

1963
02:19:40,293 --> 02:19:42,587
...and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

1964
02:19:42,712 --> 02:19:44,589
I'm an average nobody.

1965
02:19:45,548 --> 02:19:48,551
I get to live the rest of my life
like a schnook.
