1
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,473
- You're looking good, Dutch.
- It's been a long time, General.

2
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,755
Come on inside.

3
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,312
18 hours ago, we lost a chopper...
carrying a cabinet minister and his aide

4
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,436
from this charming little country.

5
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,310
We've got a transponder fixed
on their position... about here.

6
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,351
This cabinet minister, does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

7
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,270
Apparently, they strayed off course.
We're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.

8
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,909
So why don't you use the regular army?
What do you need us for?

9
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,197
Cos some damn fool
accused you of being the best.

10
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,148
Dillon.

11
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,310
You son of a bitch.

12
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,313
What's the matter? The CIA got you
pushing too many pencils?

13
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,438
- Had enough?
- Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

14
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,077
- Never did know when to quit.
- Damn good to see you, Dutch.

15
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,029
- What is this fucking tie business?
- Forget about my tie.

16
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,556
I heard about that job you pulled off in Berlin.
Very nice, Dutch.

17
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,279
- Good old days.
- Yeah, like the good old days.

18
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,636
- Then how come you passed on Libya?
- That wasn't my style.

19
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,995
You got no style, Dutch. You know that.

20
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,469
Come on. Why'd you pass?

21
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,754
We're a rescue team, not assassins.

22
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,918
Now, what we gotta do?

23
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,516
That cabinet minister
is important to our scope of operations.

24
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,593
A couple of our friends are about to
get squeezed and we can't let that happen.

25
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,998
We need the best. That's why you're here.

26
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,595
- Go on.
- Simple setup. One-day operation.

27
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,913
We pick up their trail at the chopper,
grab those hostages, and bounce back.

28
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,796
- What do you mean, "we"?
- I'm goin' in with you, Dutch.

29
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,432
General, my team always works alone.
You know that.

30
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm afraid we all have our orders, Major.

31
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,158
Once you reach your objective, Dillon will
evaluate the situation and take charge.

32
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,078
<i>Delta One-Zero to Two Leader.</i>

33
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,675
Rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.

34
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,196
- AWACS contact on four-hour intervals.
- Who's our backup?

35
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,840
No such thing. This is a one-way ticket.

36
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,230
Once we cross that border, we're on our own.

37
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,516
This is getting better by the minute.

38
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,595
Billy!

39
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,990
Billy! The other day
I went up to my girlfriend. I said,

40
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,389
"You know, I'd like a little pussy."

41
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,552
She said, "Me, too. Mine's as big as a house."

42
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,720
You see, she wanted
a littler one cos hers was...

43
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,236
big as a house.

44
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,592
Get that stinkin' shit out of my face.

45
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,274
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here.

46
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,477
This stuff'll make you
a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus,

47
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,278
just like me.

48
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,669
Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

49
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,833
That was in '72. Me and Dutch both got one.

50
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,515
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

51
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,435
<i>You got it, Leader.</i>

52
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,717
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

53
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,268
You never were that smart.

54
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,669
Hawkins, you're up.

55
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,715
<i>Lines away.</i>

56
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,400
The pilots have been shot in the head.
Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.

57
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,916
- Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
- There's something else, Major.

58
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,036
This is no ordinary army taxi.

59
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,317
It looks more like a surveillance bird to me.

60
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,075
- Pick up the trail yet?
- Billy's on it.

61
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,995
Heat seeker, Dillon. Pretty sophisticated
for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys.

62
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,719
I guess they're getting
better equipped every day.

63
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,836
There were 12 guerrillas.

64
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,356
They took the two men from the helicopter,
but there's something else.

65
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,599
- What do you mean?
- Six men wearing US-issued army boots.

66
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,798
They came in from the north,
and then they followed the guerrillas.

67
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,115
Mean anything to you?

68
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,796
Probably just another rebel patrol.
They operate in here all the time.

69
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,958
Get ahead and see what you can find.

70
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,359
What's he got?

71
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,671
Same business. Guerrillas hauling
two guys from the chopper,

72
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,558
followed by men with American equipment.

73
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,596
Do you remember Afghanistan?

74
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,877
Trying to forget it. Come on.

75
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,678
Holy mother of God.

76
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,396
Jim Hopper.

77
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,749
Mac, cut 'em down.

78
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,031
I knew these men.

79
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,079
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.
What the hell were they doing here?

80
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,197
I don't know, Dutch. This is inhuman.

81
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,078
Nobody told me
there was an operation in this area.

82
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,835
- They shouldn't have been here.
- Somebody sent them.

83
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,232
The guerrillas skinned them?

84
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,754
Why did they skin them?

85
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,194
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

86
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,835
- What happened here, Billy?
- Strange, Major.

87
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,434
There was a firefight.

88
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,592
They were shooting in all directions.

89
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,989
I can't believe Hopper
walked into an ambush.

90
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,753
I don't believe he did.

91
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,957
I can't find a single track.

92
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,033
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What about the rest of Hopper's men?

93
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,588
There's no sign, sir.

94
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,831
They never left here.

95
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,717
It's like they just disappeared.

96
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,959
Stick with the guerrilla trail.
Let's get the hostages.

97
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,079
We move, five-metre spread. No sound.

98
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,671
It's time to let old painless out the bag.

99
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,270
Payback time.

100
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,474
You're ghostin' us, motherfucker.
I don't care who you are back in the world.

101
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,032
You give our position one more time,
I'll bleed you, real quiet, and leave you here.

102
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,190
Got that?

103
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,711
Fuck you.

104
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,988
He killed one of the hostages. We move.

105
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,071
Mac, Blain - the nest.

106
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,833
Billy, Poncho - the guard.
Hawkins, Dillon - backup.

107
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,230
As soon as they're set, I hit the fuel dump.

108
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,791
One down.

109
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,230
What the hell's he doin'?

110
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,038
What the fuck...?

111
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,311
Showtime, kid.

112
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,755
Target's the centre of the palapa.

113
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,155
Dutch, on your nine.

114
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,350
Get that mother.

115
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,992
Stick around.

116
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,590
Hostages inside.

117
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,559
Knock, knock.

118
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,633
I got 'em.

119
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,316
Hawkins, call in position and situation.
Get Con Op on the hook.

120
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,311
You got it, Major.

121
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,590
Shit.

122
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,195
Mac. Any sign of the other hostage?

123
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,593
Found the other guy - he's dead, too -
and the gear from the chopper.

124
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,831
But if they're Central American,
I'm a goddamn Chinaman.

125
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,471
From the looks of it, our cabinet minister was
CIA. Another thing, Major. We were lucky.

126
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,712
Other guys they waxed...
were Russian military advisers.

127
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,995
Something pretty big
was gonna happen here.

128
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,640
Good work, Mac. Clear the area. No traces.

129
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,359
Get the men ready to move.

130
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,190
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.

131
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,193
- You're hit. You're bleedin', man.
- I ain't got time to bleed.

132
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,954
You got time to duck?

133
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,629
This is goddamn beautiful.

134
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,068
Goddamn jackpot.
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

135
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,674
We got those bastards.

136
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,676
- We got 'em.
- I think this is what you're looking for.

137
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,912
You set us up. It's all bullshit. All of it.

138
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,993
The cabinet minister, the whole business.
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

139
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,709
We stopped a major invasion.
In three days they'd have crossed the border.

140
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,156
- Why us?
- Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

141
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,995
- You're pissed about the cover story.
- So, what story did you hand to Hopper?

142
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,790
We've been looking for this place for months.
My men were in that chopper when it got hit.

143
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,919
- Hopper went in and he disappeared.
- He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive.

144
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,560
I had to get somebody
who could crack these bastards.

145
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,952
So you cooked up a story
and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.

146
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,833
What happened to you, Dillon?

147
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,673
You used to be somebody I could trust.

148
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,035
I woke up.

149
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,350
Why don't you?

150
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,351
You're an asset,

151
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,954
an expendable asset,

152
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,874
and I used you to get the job done. Got it?

153
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,434
My men are not expendable.

154
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,950
And I don't do this kind of work.

155
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,750
Major, we stepped into some real shit here.

156
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,516
We've got guerrillas all over the place.
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

157
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,636
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe less.

158
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,952
- Tell Mac we move in five.
- She goes with us. She's too valuable.

159
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,918
She'll give away our position
any chance she gets. No deal.

160
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,150
You're still under orders, Major.

161
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,959
Now, you wanna make that call or should I?

162
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,636
She's your baggage.
You fall behind and you're on your own.

163
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,359
This place is too hot for a pickup. They won't
touch us till we get over the border.

164
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,434
Billy. Give me a way out of this hole.
Aerial says we are cut off.

165
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,115
The only way outta here
is that valley that leads to the east.

166
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,668
I wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.

167
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,751
Not much choice.

168
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,798
Poncho, take lead. Double-time it.

169
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,714
Dillon.

170
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,151
Over here.

171
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,269
- Turn around.
- Why?

172
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,273
Thanks.

173
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,631
Any time.

174
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,671
Billy.

175
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,192
The other day
I was goin' down on my girlfriend.

176
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,398
I said to her, "Jeez, you've got a big pussy.
Jeez, you've got a big pussy."

177
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,916
She said, "Why did you say that twice?"
I said, "I didn't."

178
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,115
See, it was cos of the echo.

179
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,349
Over here.

180
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,598
Turn around.

181
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,675
Turn around. Over here.

182
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,359
Any time.

183
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,434
Any time.

184
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,838
Goddamn.

185
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,358
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

186
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,830
I've seen some bad-ass bush before, man,
but nothin' like this.

187
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,232
I hear you. This shit's somethin'.

188
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,596
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

189
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,434
Hey, a little taste of home.

190
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,349
You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.

191
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,869
Come on. Stop sandbaggin' it. Now, get up.

192
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,679
Come on, get up. Would you get up?

193
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,517
Maybe you'd better
put her on a leash, agent man.

194
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,832
Try it again... please.

195
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,715
What's got Billy so spooked?

196
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,756
Can't say, Major.

197
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,434
Been acting squirrely all morning.

198
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,876
That damn nose of his... it's weird.

199
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,991
What is it?

200
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,918
Billy...

201
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,312
What the hell is wrong with you?

202
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,233
There's something in those trees.

203
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,708
Do you see anything?

204
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,791
Up there.

205
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,031
Nothing.

206
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,710
What do you think?

207
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,680
I guess it's nothing, Major.

208
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,554
Please.

209
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,198
Please.

210
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,512
Billy, break left.

211
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,431
Mac, right.

212
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,752
- What the...? This isn't her blood.
- What the hell'd you do to him?

213
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,832
Major... you'd better take a look at this.

214
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,831
Did you find Hawkins?

215
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,478
I...

216
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,676
I can't tell.

217
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,440
What in God's name...?

218
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,636
I think it's Hawkins.

219
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,759
- Where the hell is his body?
- There's no sign of it.

220
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,639
Ask her what happened.

221
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,270
She says the jungle...
it just came alive and took him.

222
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,477
Bullshit. That's not what she said.

223
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,152
- It doesn't make sense.
- Those sappers have followed us...

224
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,834
They've been in front of us. This woman...

225
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,192
Hold it.

226
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,637
Hold it. Why didn't they take
his radio or his weapon?

227
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,109
Why didn't she escape?

228
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,716
- Hopper.
- What?

229
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,634
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

230
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,313
I want Hawkins' body found. Sweep pattern.
Double back. 50 metres. Let's go.

231
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,955
Come on in, you fuckers.

232
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,517
Come on in.

233
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,989
Old painless is waitin'.

234
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,995
Sergeant.

235
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,354
Motherfucker.

236
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,876
- What happened?
- I saw it.

237
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,155
- You saw what?
- I saw it.

238
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,911
Blain.

239
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,629
No powder burns, no shrapnel.

240
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,113
The wound's all fused, cauterised.
What the hell could have done this to a man?

241
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,679
Mac.

242
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,354
Mac, look at me.

243
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,477
- Who did this?
- I don't know, goddamn it.

244
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,233
I saw something.

245
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,388
Not a thing. Not a fuckin' trace.

246
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,836
No blood, no bodies. We hit nothing.

247
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,754
Dillon, better get on the radio.

248
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,111
Mac.

249
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,437
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,435
I want a defensive position above that ridge
mined with everything we've got.

251
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,719
- Put him in his poncho. Take him with us.
- I got him.

252
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,995
Major, I set up flares, frags and claymores.

253
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,750
Nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on somethin'.

254
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,151
Thank you, Sergeant.

255
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,912
Mac.

256
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,153
He was a good soldier.

257
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,231
He was...

258
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,191
my friend.

259
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,716
Goodbye, bro.

260
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,952
Blazer One, I repeat, extraction necessary.

261
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,395
Say again, Blazer One. Say again.

262
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,598
<i>Request for extraction denied.</i>
<i>Area is still compromised.</i>

263
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:17,391
<i>Proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner</i>
<i>extraction. Priority, out. Next contact 0930.</i>

264
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,392
Roger, Blazer One. 1030 hours.

265
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,471
Damn bastards.

266
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,438
They say we're still in too far.
They can't risk coming in.

267
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,830
We're assets, Dillon. Expendable assets.

268
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,434
It comes with the job. I can accept it.

269
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,080
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

270
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,954
Shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow.

271
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,433
Sergeant?

272
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,909
Sergeant. Who hit us today?

273
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,598
I don't know.

274
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,229
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

275
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,515
He was there.

276
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,830
Those eyes disappeared.

277
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,831
What was that?

278
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,717
Those eyes, they...

279
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,677
they disappeared.

280
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,188
I know one thing, Major.
I drew and fired straight at it.

281
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,671
Capped off 200 rounds
in the Minigun... Full pack.

282
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,673
Nothing... nothing on this earth
could have lived.

283
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,035
Not at that range.

284
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,718
Mac, you take first watch,
then you get some rest.

285
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,669
Ask her. Ask her what she saw.
Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

286
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,594
Go ahead. Ask her.

287
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,675
She says the same fuckin' thing.
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

288
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,275
Billy... you know something. What is it?

289
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,757
- I'm scared, Poncho.
- Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

290
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,671
There's something out there waiting for us,

291
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,676
and it ain't no man.

292
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,915
We're all gonna die.

293
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,990
He's losing his cool. There's a couple of
guys out there and we gotta take 'em down.

294
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,038
You still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

295
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:30,079
Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper,

296
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,469
and now it wants us.

297
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,998
Here we are again, bro,

298
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,435
just you and me.

299
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,751
Same kind of moon and same kind ofjungle.

300
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,718
Real number 10 night, remember?

301
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,430
Whole platoon, 32 men chopped into meat,
and we walk out, just you and me.

302
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,354
Nobody else. Right on top, bro.

303
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,717
Not a scratch. Not a fuckin' scratch.
You know, whoever got you,

304
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,954
he'll come back again, and when he does,
I'm gonna cut your name right into him.

305
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,555
I'm gonna cut your name into him.

306
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,870
Mac.

307
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,271
- This way.
- Where the hell are you?

308
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,351
Where are you?

309
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,950
Where are you?

310
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,320
Mac, where are you?

311
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,233
Jesus.

312
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,436
I got you, motherfucker.

313
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,875
I killed you, you fuck.

314
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,997
Jesus. You killed a pig.

315
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,878
Do you think you could have found
something bigger?

316
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,758
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you.

317
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,630
- Where's the girl?
- Shit.

318
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,839
Why wasn't anybody watching her?

319
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,114
Why didn't she try to get away?

320
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,510
Look at her. She's scared out of her mind.

321
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,910
Major, you better take a look at this.

322
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,112
Blain's body, it's gone.

323
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,509
It came in through the tripwires.

324
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,910
Took it right out from under our noses.

325
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:07,114
That boar had to set off the trip flare, Major,
cos there ain't no other tracks.

326
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,512
How could anyone get through this
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

327
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,717
And why didn't he try and kill one of us?

328
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,712
He came in to get the body.

329
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,950
He's killing us one at a time.

330
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,395
Like a hunter.

331
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,157
He's using the trees.

332
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,353
Yesterday, what did you see?

333
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,796
- You're wasting your time.
- No more games.

334
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,319
I don't know what it was.

335
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,150
- It...
- Go on.

336
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,198
It changed colours like the chameleon.

337
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,669
It uses the jungle.

338
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,991
Are you sayin' Blain and Hawkins were killed
by a fuckin' lizard?

339
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:19,598
That's a bullshit psych job. There's two
or three men at the most. Fucking lizard.

340
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,240
- What's your name?
- Anna.

341
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,110
Anna, this thing is hunting us. All of us.

342
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,071
You know that.

343
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,314
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need everyone.

344
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,517
- I'm taking her back. We're out of here.
- We're not going yet.

345
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,717
The rendezvous is 10 miles away.
You think the chopper'll wait?

346
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,590
Dillon, we make a stand now, or there will be
nobody left to go to the chopper.

347
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,035
There is something else.

348
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,829
When the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.

349
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,514
Its blood was on the leaves.

350
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,398
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

351
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,268
Look out.

352
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,435
You really think
this boy-scout bullshit's gonna work.

353
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,195
It can see our tripwires.
Maybe it can't see this.

354
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,590
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

355
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,588
What makes you think
he'll come in through here?

356
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,231
There are tripwires on every tree for 50 yards.
This is the only way in.

357
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,068
When I was little, we found a man.

358
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,071
He looked like,

359
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,151
like, butchered.

360
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,754
The old women in the village
crossed themselves

361
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,230
and whispered crazy things,
said strange things.

362
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,192
Only in the hottest years this happens.

363
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,831
And this year it grows hot.

364
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,398
We begin finding our men.

365
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,836
We found them sometimes without their skin,

366
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,117
and sometimes much, much worse.

367
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:17,477
<i>"El que hace trofeos de los hombres"</i> means
"the demon who makes trophies of man."

368
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,077
So, what you gonna try next? Cheese?

369
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,909
Hey, Dutch!

370
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,833
Shit.

371
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,549
Got you, motherfucker. I got you.

372
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,431
I'm coming.

373
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:37,116
Mac. Mac. Get Ramirez on his feet
and get to the chopper.

374
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,272
- Hold it. I'm going after Mac.
- That's not your style, Dillon.

375
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,069
I picked up some bad habits from you.
Get your people the hell outta here.

376
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,754
You can't win this, Dillon.

377
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,593
Maybe I can get even.

378
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,031
Dillon.

379
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,351
Just hold on to that damn chopper.

380
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,549
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

381
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,077
- I can make it. I can make it.
- Get the radio. Forget the rest.

382
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,835
Come on, Poncho.

383
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,392
Long tall Sally

384
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,072
She's built sweet

385
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,357
She got everything that Uncle John need

386
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,271
Oh, baby

387
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,868
Baby

388
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,315
I'm gonna have me some fun

389
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,630
I'm gonna have me some fun

390
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,231
Turn around.

391
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,591
Over here.

392
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,031
Over here.

393
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,071
Mac?

394
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,154
Out there. Past them trees.

395
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,237
You see it?

396
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,355
I see you.

397
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,551
I see it.

398
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,271
I see it.

399
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,911
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.
You work your way down there toward him.

400
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:38,753
I'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.
When I flush that son of a bitch, you nail him.

401
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,559
I got a score to settle.

402
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,996
We've both got scores to settle.

403
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,073
Come on. Quickly. Hurry up.

404
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,119
Don't. Leave it.
It didn't kill you because you weren't armed.

405
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,191
No sport.

406
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,519
Mac.

407
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,519
Any time.

408
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,474
Let's go.

409
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,591
Billy.

410
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,389
Billy, let's go.

411
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,991
Give me the weapon.

412
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,115
No.

413
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,997
Run.

414
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,230
Run.

415
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,639
Go.

416
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,871
Get to the chopper.

417
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,477
Oh, shit.

418
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,750
He couldn't see me.

419
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,871
Bleed, bastard.

420
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,631
You're one ugly motherfucker.

421
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,560
Bad idea.

422
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,238
Come on.

423
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,075
Come on. Do it.

424
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,151
Do it.

425
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,158
Come on. Come on.

426
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:15,152
Kill me. I'm here. Kill me.

427
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,551
I'm here. Kill me.

428
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,438
Come on. Kill me. I'm here.

429
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,557
Come on. Do it now. Kill me.

430
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,515
What the hell are you?

431
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:51,154
What the hell are you?

432
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,955
What the...?

433
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,035
My God.
