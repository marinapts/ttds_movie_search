1
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,404
Hi, honey.

2
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,142
Hi, Mom.

3
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,481
You feeling any better?

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,579
A little bit.

5
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:58,590
Guess what.

6
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,750
What?

7
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,623
Grandfather's here.

8
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,686
Mom, can't you tell him
that I'm sick?

9
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,893
You're sick.
That's why he's here.

10
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,696
He'll pinch my cheek.

11
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:11,327
I hate that.

12
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,099
Maybe he won't.

13
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:16,630
How's the sickie?

14
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,571
I'll leave you two pals alone.

15
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:25,913
I brought you a special present.

16
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,816
- What is it?
- Open it up.

17
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:35,351
- A book?
- That's right.

18
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:38,557
When I was your age,
television was called books.

19
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,861
This is a special book.

20
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:44,198
It was the book my father used
to read to me when I was sick...

21
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,602
and I used to read it
to your father.

22
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,198
Today I'm going to read it
to you.

23
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:51,334
Does it got any sports in it?

24
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:52,775
Are you kidding?

25
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:56,747
Fencing, fighting,
torture, revenge...

26
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,273
giants, monsters, chases...

27
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:03,277
escapes, true love, miracles.

28
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:05,256
That doesn't sound too bad.

29
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,724
I'll try and stay awake.

30
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,160
Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

31
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:13,824
Your vote of confidence
is overwhelming.

32
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,834
All right.

33
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:20,496
"The Princess Bride...

34
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,507
"by S. Morgenstern.

35
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,509
"Chapter One.

36
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:27,512
"Buttercup was raised
on a small farm...

37
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,514
"in the country of Florin.

38
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:32,517
"Her favorite pastimes
were riding her horse...

39
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,520
"and tormenting the farm boy
that worked there.

40
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:39,513
"His name was Westley,
but she never called him that."

41
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:41,617
Isn't that
a wonderful beginning?

42
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,959
Yeah, it's really good.

43
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:48,160
"Nothing gave Buttercup
as much pleasure...

44
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,168
as ordering Westley around."

45
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:52,864
Farm boy,
polish my horse's saddle.

46
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,840
I want to see my face
shining in it by morning.

47
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,705
As you wish.

48
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:04,143
"As you wish"
was all he ever said to her.

49
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:09,419
Farm boy, fill these with water.

50
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,948
Please.

51
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,391
As you wish.

52
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,798
That day she was amazed
to discover...

53
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:23,733
that when he was saying,
"As you wish"...

54
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,930
what he meant was,
"I love you."

55
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:31,167
Even more amazing
was the day she realized...

56
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,576
she truly loved him back.

57
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:36,241
Farm boy.

58
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:44,522
Fetch me that pitcher.

59
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:01,599
As you wish.

60
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:12,946
Hold it, hold it.

61
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,886
What is this?
Are you trying to trick me?

62
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,889
And where's the sports?

63
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,756
Is this a kissing book?

64
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,555
Wait. Just wait.

65
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,755
When does it get good?

66
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,765
Keep your shirt on
and let me read.

67
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:30,199
"Westley had no money
for marriage...

68
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:32,726
"so he packed his few belongings
and left the farm...

69
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,636
"to seek his fortune
across the sea."

70
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:38,541
It was a very emotional time
for Buttercup.

71
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:40,772
I don't believe this!

72
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:43,872
I fear I'll never see you again.

73
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,974
Of course you will.

74
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,249
What if something
happens to you?

75
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,053
Hear this now...

76
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,789
I will always come for you.

77
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:01,356
But how can you be sure?

78
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,300
This is true love.

79
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,834
Do you think this happens
every day?

80
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,746
Westley didn't reach
his destination.

81
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:25,086
His ship was attacked
by the Dread Pirate Roberts...

82
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:27,523
who never left captives alive.

83
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,528
When Buttercup got the news
that Westley was murdered...

84
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,496
Murdered by pirates is good!

85
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,522
She went into her room
and shut the door...

86
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,797
and for days
she neither slept nor ate.

87
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:40,566
I will never love again.

88
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:49,536
Five years later, the main
square of Florin City...

89
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:52,709
was filled as never before
to hear the announcement...

90
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,413
of the great Prince
Humperdinck's bride-to-be.

91
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,728
My people...

92
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,995
a month from now...

93
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:12,970
our country
will have its 500th anniversary.

94
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:17,134
On that sundown,
I shall marry a lady...

95
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:20,736
who was once a commoner
like yourselves...

96
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:26,581
but perhaps you will not
find her common now.

97
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,552
Would you like to meet her?

98
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:36,624
My people,
the princess Buttercup!

99
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,740
Buttercup's emptiness
consumed her.

100
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,345
Although the law of the land
gave Humperdinck...

101
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:04,651
the right to choose his bride...

102
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:07,522
she did not love him.

103
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:13,692
Despite Humperdinck's
reassurance...

104
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:16,030
that she would grow
to love him...

105
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:19,628
the only joy she found
was in her daily ride.

106
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,751
A word, my lady?

107
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:38,745
We are but poor,
lost circus performers.

108
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,350
Is there a village nearby?

109
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:44,589
There is nothing nearby,
not for miles.

110
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,190
Then there will be no one
to hear you scream.

111
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:56,764
What is that you're ripping?

112
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,073
It's fabric from the uniform
of an army officer of Guilder.

113
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,840
Who's Guilder?

114
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,406
The country across the sea,
the sworn enemy of Florin.

115
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:06,643
Go!

116
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:09,175
Once the horse
reaches the castle...

117
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,949
the fabric will make
the prince suspect...

118
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:13,388
that the Guilderians
have abducted his love.

119
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:16,154
When he finds her body dead
on the Guilder frontier...

120
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:18,754
his suspicions
will be totally confirmed.

121
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:21,321
You never said anything
about killing anyone.

122
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:23,993
I've hired you to help me
start a war.

123
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,798
It's a prestigious
line of work...

124
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,704
with a long
and glorious tradition.

125
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:32,106
I just don't think it's right,
killing an innocent girl.

126
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:37,274
Am I going mad, or did the word
"think" escape your lips?

127
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:39,579
You were not hired
for your brains...

128
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,244
you hippopotamic land mass!

129
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:42,809
I agree with Fezzik.

130
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:45,254
The sot has spoken!

131
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:48,122
What happens to her
is not truly your concern!

132
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,626
I will kill her!

133
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,685
And remember this,
never forget this...

134
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:54,425
When I found you,
you were so slobbering drunk...

135
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:56,729
you couldn't buy brandy!

136
00:08:56,767 --> 00:09:00,703
And you...
friendless, brainless...

137
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:02,763
helpless, hopeless!

138
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:06,174
Do you want me to send you
back to where you were...

139
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,441
unemployed in Greenland?

140
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:26,994
That Vizzini, he can... fuss.

141
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:28,498
Fuss, fuss...

142
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:32,491
I think he like to scream...
at us.

143
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:37,166
Probably he means no... harm.

144
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,575
He's really very short on...
charm.

145
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,512
You have a great gift for rhyme.

146
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,515
Yes, yes, some of the time.

147
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,710
Enough of that!

148
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:49,515
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?

149
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:52,522
If there are, we'll all be dead.

150
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:55,525
No more rhymes, now. I mean it!

151
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,550
Anybody want a peanut?

152
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,796
We'll reach the cliffs by dawn.

153
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,202
Why are you doing that?

154
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:14,768
Making sure
nobody's following us.

155
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,712
That would be inconceivable.

156
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:18,806
Despite what you think...

157
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:21,511
you will be caught,
and when you are...

158
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,884
the prince
will see you all hanged.

159
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,583
Of all the necks on this boat,
Highness...

160
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:29,388
the one you should be
worrying about is your own.

161
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:35,562
Stop doing that!

162
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,897
We can all relax.
It's almost over.

163
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:39,664
You are sure
nobody's following us?

164
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:42,764
As I told you, it would be
absolutely, totally...

165
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,173
and in all other ways
inconceivable!

166
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,177
No one in Guilder
knows what we've done...

167
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:50,772
and no one in Florin
could have gotten here so fast.

168
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,252
Out of curiosity,
why do you ask?

169
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:59,552
I happened to look behind us,
and something is there.

170
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,114
What?

171
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:10,024
Probably some local fisherman...

172
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,661
out for a pleasure cruise
at night...

173
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:15,001
through eel-infested waters.

174
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:17,965
What?

175
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,476
Go in! Get after her!

176
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,205
I don't swim.

177
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:23,008
I only dog-paddle.

178
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:27,084
Veer left!

179
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:30,747
Left!

180
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:42,532
Do you know what that sound is,
Highness?

181
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:45,194
Those are the shrieking eels.

182
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:47,761
If you don't believe me,
just wait.

183
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:50,137
They always grow louder...

184
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:53,507
when they're about to feed
on human flesh.

185
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:57,137
If you swim back now...

186
00:11:57,181 --> 00:12:00,173
I promise no harm
will come to you.

187
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:04,551
I doubt you'll get such an offer
from the eels.

188
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:16,694
She doesn't get eaten
by the eels at this time.

189
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:18,065
What?

190
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,070
The eel doesn't get her.

191
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:22,971
I'm explaining to you
because you look nervous.

192
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,840
I wasn't nervous.

193
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:30,113
Maybe I was
a little bit concerned...

194
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:31,705
but that's not the same thing.

195
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,115
Because we can stop now
if you want.

196
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:37,951
No. You could read
a little bit more, if you want.

197
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:42,391
"Do you know
what that sound is, Highness?

198
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:44,758
"Those are the shrieking eels."

199
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:47,263
Pass that, Grandpa.
You read it already.

200
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:50,165
My goodness, I did.

201
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:52,761
I'm sorry. Beg your pardon.

202
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,430
All right, all right. Let's see.

203
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,373
She was in the water,
the eel was coming after her...

204
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:58,705
she was frightened...

205
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:00,903
the eel started to charge her,
and then...

206
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:06,072
Put her down. Just put her down!

207
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,312
I think he's getting closer.

208
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:14,381
He's no concern of ours.

209
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:16,017
Sail on!

210
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,358
I suppose you think
you're brave, don't you?

211
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:20,955
Only compared to some.

212
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:29,505
Look! He's right on top of us!

213
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,338
I wonder if he's using
the same wind we are using.

214
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,937
Whoever he is, he's too late.
See?

215
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:40,515
The Cliffs of Insanity!

216
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:42,576
Hurry up!

217
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,485
Move the thing!

218
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:47,252
And that other thing!

219
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,691
Move it!

220
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:55,261
We're safe.

221
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:57,927
Only Fezzik is strong enough
to go up our way.

222
00:13:57,968 --> 00:14:01,836
He'll have to sail for hours
till he finds a harbor.

223
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:50,610
He's climbing the rope,
and he's gaining on us!

224
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,280
Inconceivable!

225
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:55,754
Faster!

226
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,918
I thought I was going faster.

227
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,224
You were supposed to be
this colossus...

228
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,128
you were
this great legendary thing...

229
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:03,825
and yet he gains!

230
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:07,131
I'm carrying three people,
and he got only himself.

231
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:11,333
I do not accept excuses.
I have to find a new giant.

232
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:14,002
Don't say that, Vizzini, please.

233
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:23,312
Did I make it clear
that your job is at stake?

234
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,177
He's got very good arms.

235
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,985
He didn't fall?

236
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:31,486
Inconceivable!

237
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,488
You keep using that word.

238
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:37,458
I do not think it means
what you think it means.

239
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:40,860
My God, he's climbing.

240
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:43,524
Whoever he is, he's obviously
seen us with the princess...

241
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:44,863
and must therefore die.

242
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,333
You carry her.

243
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:48,064
We'll head straight
for the Guilder frontier.

244
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,503
Catch up when he's dead.

245
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:52,029
If he falls, fine.
If not, the sword.

246
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:54,474
I'm going to duel him
left-handed.

247
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,774
You know what a hurry we're in.

248
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:58,712
It's the only way
I can be satisfied.

249
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,649
If I use my right, tsk!
Over too quickly.

250
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,447
Have it your way!

251
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:11,921
You be careful.

252
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:14,020
People in masks
cannot be trusted.

253
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:17,291
I'm waiting!

254
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:31,440
Hello there!

255
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:36,678
Slow going?

256
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:40,621
I don't mean to be rude, but
this is not as easy as it looks.

257
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:43,591
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't distract me.

258
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,059
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

259
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:57,365
I do not suppose
you could speed things up?

260
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:58,964
If you're in such a hurry...

261
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:01,306
you could lower a rope
or a tree branch...

262
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,538
or find something useful to do.

263
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:07,913
I could do that.
I got some rope up here...

264
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,111
but I do not think
you would accept my help...

265
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:12,313
since I am only waiting around
to kill you.

266
00:18:12,354 --> 00:18:15,551
That does put a damper
on our relationship.

267
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:20,119
But I promise I won't kill you
until you reach the top.

268
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:24,223
That's very comforting, but I'm
afraid you'll just have to wait.

269
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,131
I hate waiting.

270
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:29,160
I could give you my word
as a Spaniard.

271
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:30,729
No good.

272
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:32,741
I've known too many Spaniards.

273
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:34,902
Any way you'll trust me?

274
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:37,037
Nothing comes to mind.

275
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,607
I swear on the soul
of my father, Domingo Montoya...

276
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,743
you will reach the top alive.

277
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,947
Throw me the rope.

278
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,547
Thank you.

279
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:21,044
Wait.
We'll wait until you're ready.

280
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,081
Again, thank you.

281
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:39,739
I do not mean to pry,
but you don't by any chance...

282
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:42,403
happen to have six fingers
on your right hand?

283
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,238
Do you always begin
conversations this way?

284
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:49,843
My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

285
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:58,159
He was a great swordmaker,
my father.

286
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:00,662
When the six-fingered man
appeared...

287
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:02,664
and request a special sword...

288
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,666
my father took the job.

289
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,261
He slaved a year
before he was done.

290
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:20,042
I've never seen its equal.

291
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:24,178
The six-fingered man
returned and demanded it...

292
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,688
but at 1/10 his promised price.

293
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:28,690
My father refused.

294
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:30,715
Without a word...

295
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:34,695
the six-fingered man
slashed him through the heart.

296
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,721
I loved my father.

297
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:40,394
So naturally, I challenged
his murderer to a duel.

298
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:43,166
I failed.

299
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:47,375
The six-fingered man
leave me alive...

300
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:50,173
but he gave me this.

301
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:54,246
How old were you?

302
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:56,649
I was eleven years old.

303
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:58,653
When I was strong enough...

304
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:02,589
I dedicated my life
to the study of fencing.

305
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:07,585
So the next time we meet,
I will not fail.

306
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,897
I will go up to
the six-fingered man and say...

307
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,596
"Hello.

308
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:17,606
"My name is Inigo Montoya.

309
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,609
"You killed my father.

310
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:22,838
"Prepare to die."

311
00:21:22,878 --> 00:21:26,314
You've done nothing
but study swordplay?

312
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:29,511
More pursuit than study lately.

313
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:31,746
You see, I cannot find him.

314
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:35,154
It's been twenty years now.
I'm starting to lose confidence.

315
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,522
I just work for Vizzini
to pay the bills.

316
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,823
There's not a lot of money
in revenge.

317
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:44,967
I certainly hope
you find him someday.

318
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,124
You're ready, then?

319
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:48,033
Whether I am or not,
you've been more than fair.

320
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,471
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.

321
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:54,407
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.

322
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:57,872
Begin.

323
00:22:29,511 --> 00:22:31,809
You are using Bonetti's defense
against me?

324
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:34,475
I thought it fitting
considering the rocky terrain.

325
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:37,110
Naturally. You must expect me
to attack with Capo Ferro.

326
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:40,815
Naturally, but I find that
Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro.

327
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:43,416
Don't you?

328
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,392
Unless the enemy
has studied Agrippa.

329
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:49,320
Which I have.

330
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:55,261
You are wonderful!

331
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:57,294
Thank you.
I've worked hard to become so.

332
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:59,364
I admit it.
You are better than I am.

333
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:00,875
Then why are you smiling?

334
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:02,774
Because I know something
you don't know.

335
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:04,073
What is that?

336
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:06,103
I am not left-handed.

337
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,591
You're amazing.

338
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:20,754
I ought to be,
after twenty years.

339
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:22,923
There's something
I ought to tell you.

340
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:24,226
Tell me.

341
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:26,632
I'm not left-handed, either.

342
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:54,691
Who are you?

343
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:56,321
No one of consequence.

344
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:57,888
I must know.

345
00:23:57,933 --> 00:23:59,696
Get used to disappointment.

346
00:24:43,745 --> 00:24:45,804
Kill me quickly.

347
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:47,678
I would sooner destroy
a stained-glass window...

348
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:49,115
as an artist like yourself.

349
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:52,643
However, since I can't have you
following me, either.

350
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:59,718
Please understand, I hold you
in the highest respect.

351
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,497
Inconceivable!

352
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,975
Give her to me!
Catch up with us quickly!

353
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,136
What do I do?

354
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:18,169
Finish him,
finish him... your way!

355
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:21,341
Good, my way.
Thank you, Vizzini.

356
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:23,977
Which way's my way?

357
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:26,954
Pick up one of those rocks,
get behind the boulder.

358
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:28,216
In a few minutes...

359
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:30,690
the man in black will come
running around the bend.

360
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:35,025
The minute his head is in view,
hit it with the rock!

361
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:39,064
My way is not
very sportsmanlike.

362
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:09,664
I did that on purpose.

363
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:11,757
I didn't have to miss.

364
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,665
I believe you.

365
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:16,364
So what happens now?

366
00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:19,339
We face each other
as God intended.

367
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:20,841
Sportsmanlike.

368
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:24,538
No tricks, no weapons.
Skill against skill alone.

369
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:28,276
You'll put down your rock,
and I'll put down my sword...

370
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:30,682
and we'll try and kill each
other like civilized people?

371
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,085
I could kill you now.

372
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:35,089
Frankly, I think the odds...

373
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:38,615
are slightly in your favor
at hand-fighting.

374
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,993
It's not my fault being
the biggest and the strongest.

375
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,964
I don't even exercise.

376
00:27:03,318 --> 00:27:06,310
Are you just fiddling around
with me, or what?

377
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:09,221
I want you to feel
you are doing well.

378
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:10,918
I hate for people
to die embarrassed.

379
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:14,561
You're quick!

380
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:15,995
Good thing, too!

381
00:27:16,031 --> 00:27:17,225
Why are you wearing a mask?

382
00:27:17,265 --> 00:27:19,199
Were you burned with acid
or something like that?

383
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:21,327
No. It's just they're
terribly comfortable.

384
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:23,735
I think everyone will be
wearing them in the future.

385
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:32,844
I just figured why you
give me so much trouble.

386
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:36,476
Why is that, do you think?

387
00:27:36,518 --> 00:27:41,581
I haven't fought
just one person for so long.

388
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:44,820
I've been specializing
in groups.

389
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,986
Battling gangs
for local charities...

390
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:48,359
that kind of thing.

391
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:53,267
Why should that make
such a... Oof! Difference?

392
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:55,428
Well, you see...

393
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,165
you use different moves...

394
00:27:57,205 --> 00:28:01,608
when you're fighting
half a dozen people...

395
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:03,668
than when you only...

396
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,081
have to be worried about one.

397
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:23,556
I do not envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

398
00:28:23,598 --> 00:28:28,262
But in the meantime, rest well
and dream of large women.

399
00:28:45,353 --> 00:28:47,583
There was...

400
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:50,113
a mighty duel.

401
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,590
It ranged all over.

402
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,688
They were both masters.

403
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:59,132
Who won? How did it end?

404
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:02,659
The loser ran off alone...

405
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:09,610
while the winner... followed
those footprints toward Guilder.

406
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:11,703
Shall we track them both?

407
00:29:11,747 --> 00:29:14,113
The loser is nothing.

408
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:16,583
Only the princess matters.

409
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:19,587
Clearly, this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder.

410
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:23,057
We must all be ready
for whatever lies ahead.

411
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:24,388
Could this be a trap?

412
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:27,293
I always think
everything could be a trap.

413
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:29,388
That is why I'm still alive.

414
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:44,840
So, it is down to you,
and it is down to me.

415
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:48,509
If you wish her dead...

416
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,848
by all means,
keep moving forward.

417
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:52,615
Let me explain.

418
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:54,622
There's nothing to explain.

419
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:57,454
You're trying to kidnap
what I've rightfully stolen.

420
00:29:57,492 --> 00:30:00,325
Perhaps... an arrangement
can be reached.

421
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:04,196
There will be no arrangement,
and you're killing her.

422
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:10,426
If there can be no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.

423
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:11,632
I'm afraid so.

424
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:14,141
I can't compete with you
physically...

425
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:16,940
and you're no match
for my brains.

426
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:18,104
You're that smart?

427
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:19,636
Let me put it this way...

428
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:22,844
have you ever heard of Plato,
Aristotle, Socrates?

429
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:24,579
- Yes.
- Morons.

430
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:25,745
Really?

431
00:30:25,787 --> 00:30:29,553
In that case, I challenge you
to a battle of wits.

432
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:32,025
For the princess?

433
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,494
To the death?

434
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:36,053
I accept.

435
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:38,190
Good, then pour the wine.

436
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:55,906
Inhale this, but do not touch.

437
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:59,550
I smell nothing.

438
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:01,681
What you do not smell
is called iocane powder.

439
00:31:01,723 --> 00:31:04,487
It is odorless, tasteless,
dissolves instantly in liquid...

440
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:08,087
and is among the more deadly
poisons known to man.

441
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:32,152
All right.
Where is the poison?

442
00:31:32,187 --> 00:31:34,849
The battle of wits has begun.

443
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,881
It ends when you decide,
and we both drink...

444
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:38,586
and find out who is right...

445
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:40,857
and who is dead.

446
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:43,160
But it's so simple.

447
00:31:43,198 --> 00:31:46,167
All I have to do is divine
from what I know of you...

448
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,135
are you the sort of man...

449
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:51,195
who would put the poison into
his own goblet or his enemy's?

450
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,604
A clever man
would put the poison...

451
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:53,869
into his own goblet...

452
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:55,740
because he would know
that only a great fool...

453
00:31:55,777 --> 00:31:57,506
would reach
for what he was given.

454
00:31:57,545 --> 00:31:58,842
I am not a great fool...

455
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,644
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

456
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:04,208
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.

457
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:05,651
You would have counted on it...

458
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:08,679
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

459
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:10,054
You've made your decision, then?

460
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:11,353
Not remotely...

461
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:14,760
because iocane comes from
Australia, as everyone knows...

462
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:17,230
and Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals...

463
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:19,961
and criminals are used to
having people not trust them...

464
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:21,434
as you are not trusted by me...

465
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:24,063
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

466
00:32:24,105 --> 00:32:26,232
Truly,
you have a dizzying intellect.

467
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:28,299
Wait till I get going!

468
00:32:28,343 --> 00:32:30,243
- Where was I?
- Australia.

469
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:32,212
Yes, Australia.
You must have suspected...

470
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:33,976
I would have known
the powder's origin...

471
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:36,540
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

472
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:37,846
You're just stalling now.

473
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:40,184
You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

474
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:41,518
You've beaten my giant...

475
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:43,456
which means
you're exceptionally strong...

476
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:45,425
so you could have put the poison
in your own goblet...

477
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,189
trusting on your strength
to save you...

478
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:49,822
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

479
00:32:49,864 --> 00:32:52,298
But you've also
bested my Spaniard...

480
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:53,699
which means
you must have studied...

481
00:32:53,735 --> 00:32:56,795
and in studying, you must have
learned that man is mortal...

482
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:58,635
so you would have
put the poison...

483
00:32:58,673 --> 00:33:00,664
as far from yourself
as possible...

484
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:03,041
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

485
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:04,978
You're trying to trick me
into giving away something.

486
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:06,139
It won't work.

487
00:33:06,181 --> 00:33:08,342
It has worked.
You've given everything away.

488
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:11,079
- I know where the poison is.
- Then make your choice.

489
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,611
I will, and I choose...
What in the world can that be?

490
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:16,021
What? Where?

491
00:33:17,692 --> 00:33:19,785
I don't see anything.

492
00:33:19,828 --> 00:33:22,695
I could have sworn
I saw something. No matter.

493
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,792
What's so funny?

494
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:28,632
I'll tell you in a minute.

495
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,137
First, let's drink...

496
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:33,402
me from my glass
and you from yours.

497
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:49,117
You guessed wrong.

498
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:51,921
You only think I guessed wrong.
That's what's so funny!

499
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,053
I switched glasses
when your back was turned!

500
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:55,585
You fool!

501
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,155
You fell victim
to one of the classic blunders.

502
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:01,293
The most famous is "Never get
involved in a land war in Asia."

503
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:04,169
But only slightly
less well known is this...

504
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:08,505
"Never go in against a Sicilian
when death is on the line!"

505
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:24,618
Who are you?

506
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,923
I am no one to be trifled with.

507
00:34:26,961 --> 00:34:29,259
That is all you ever need know.

508
00:34:29,297 --> 00:34:31,026
And to think, all that time...

509
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:32,727
it was your cup
that was poisoned.

510
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:34,632
They were both poisoned.

511
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:36,796
I spent the last few years...

512
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:40,296
building up an immunity
to iocane powder.

513
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:44,668
Someone has beaten the giant.

514
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,481
There will be great suffering
in Guilder if she dies.

515
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,599
Catch your breath.

516
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:07,931
If you'll release me...

517
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:11,336
whatever you ask for ransom,
you'll get it. I promise you.

518
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:16,232
And what is that worth...
the promise of a woman?

519
00:35:16,277 --> 00:35:17,904
You're very funny, Highness.

520
00:35:17,946 --> 00:35:19,743
I was giving you a chance.

521
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:22,113
It does not matter
where you take me...

522
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,550
there is no greater hunter
than Prince Humperdinck.

523
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:26,554
He can track a falcon
on a cloudy day.

524
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:27,885
He can find you.

525
00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:29,480
You think your dearest love
will save you?

526
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:31,185
I never said
he was my dearest love.

527
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:33,956
And, yes, he will save me.
That I know.

528
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:37,624
You admit to me
you do not love your fianc.

529
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:39,257
He knows I do not love him.

530
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,495
Are not capable of love
is what you mean.

531
00:35:43,304 --> 00:35:45,272
I have loved more deeply...

532
00:35:45,306 --> 00:35:48,298
than a killer like yourself
could ever dream.

533
00:35:50,812 --> 00:35:52,609
That was a warning, Highness.

534
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:55,047
The next time,
my hand flies on its own.

535
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:58,075
Where I come from, there are
penalties when a woman lies.

536
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:05,817
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it...

537
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,727
and there are
the princess' footprints.

538
00:36:08,763 --> 00:36:12,062
She is alive,
or was an hour ago.

539
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:15,227
If she is otherwise
when I find her...

540
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:18,670
I shall be very put out.

541
00:36:23,544 --> 00:36:26,138
- Rest, Highness.
- I know who you are.

542
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,444
Your cruelty reveals everything.

543
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:30,643
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.

544
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:34,121
With pride.
What can I do for you?

545
00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:37,147
You can die slowly,
cut into a thousand pieces.

546
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:40,256
Hardly complimentary,
Your Highness.

547
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:42,785
Why loose your venom on me?

548
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,799
You killed my love.

549
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,767
It's possible.

550
00:36:47,802 --> 00:36:50,236
I kill a lot of people.

551
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:52,762
Who was this love of yours?

552
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:57,574
Another prince like this one...
ugly, rich, and scabby?

553
00:36:58,813 --> 00:37:01,008
A farm boy, poor.

554
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:06,748
Poor and perfect with eyes
like the sea after a storm.

555
00:37:10,157 --> 00:37:11,715
On the high seas,
your ship attacked.

556
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:14,227
And the Dread Pirate Roberts
never takes prisoners.

557
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:15,888
I can't afford
to make exceptions.

558
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,057
Once word leaks out
that a pirate has gone soft...

559
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:19,396
people begin to disobey you...

560
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,697
and then it's nothing but work,
work, work all the time.

561
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:23,203
You mock my pain.

562
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:24,727
Life is pain, Highness.

563
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:28,071
Anyone who says differently
is selling something.

564
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:35,237
I remember this farm boy
of yours, I think.

565
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:38,183
This would be, what,
five years ago?

566
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:41,245
Does it bother you to hear?

567
00:37:41,288 --> 00:37:44,451
Nothing you can say
will upset me.

568
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:46,255
He died well.

569
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:48,261
That should please you.

570
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:51,264
No bribe attempts or blubbering.

571
00:37:51,298 --> 00:37:53,766
He simply said, "Please...

572
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:57,202
"please, I need to live."

573
00:37:57,238 --> 00:38:00,264
It was the please
that caught my memory.

574
00:38:00,307 --> 00:38:02,832
I asked him
what was so important.

575
00:38:02,877 --> 00:38:05,243
"True love," he replied.

576
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:09,973
Then he spoke of a girl...

577
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:11,951
of surpassing beauty
and faithfulness.

578
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:14,454
I can only assume he meant you.

579
00:38:14,488 --> 00:38:16,217
You should bless me
for destroying him...

580
00:38:16,257 --> 00:38:19,124
before he found out
what you really are.

581
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,491
And what am I?

582
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:21,961
Faithfulness he talked of,
madam...

583
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:23,190
your enduring faithfulness.

584
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,198
Tell me truly. When you
found out he was gone...

585
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:26,699
did you get engaged
to your prince that same hour...

586
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,827
or did you wait a whole week
out of respect for the dead?

587
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:31,235
You mocked me once.
Never do it again!

588
00:38:31,272 --> 00:38:33,137
I died that day!

589
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,202
You can die, too,
for all I care!

590
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:43,914
As... you... wish!

591
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:46,249
My sweet Westley.

592
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:48,619
What have I done?

593
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:09,704
They've disappeared.

594
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:12,211
He must've seen us closing in...

595
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:14,714
which might account
for his panicking into error.

596
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:17,717
Unless I'm wrong,
and I am never wrong...

597
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:20,743
they are headed
dead into the Fire Swamp.

598
00:39:31,765 --> 00:39:33,733
Can you move at all?

599
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:36,736
Move? You're alive.

600
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:39,261
If you want, I can fly.

601
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:46,242
I told you
I would always come for you.

602
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,612
Why didn't you wait for me?

603
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:50,241
Well...

604
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:52,081
you were dead.

605
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,178
Death cannot stop true love.

606
00:39:56,056 --> 00:39:58,388
All it can do is delay it
for a while.

607
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:02,023
I will never doubt again.

608
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:05,429
There will never be a need.

609
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:10,793
Oh, no. No, please.

610
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:12,965
What is it? What's the matter?

611
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:14,770
They're kissing again.

612
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:17,538
Do we have to hear
the kissing part?

613
00:40:17,578 --> 00:40:20,012
Someday you may not
mind so much.

614
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:23,448
Skip on to the Fire Swamp.
That sounded good.

615
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:27,787
You're sick. I'll humor you.

616
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:30,312
So now, where were we here?

617
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:38,054
Westley and Buttercup
raced along the ravine floor.

618
00:40:38,098 --> 00:40:41,534
Your pig fianc is too late.

619
00:40:43,504 --> 00:40:46,371
A few more steps, and we'll
be safe in the Fire Swamp.

620
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:48,307
We'll never survive.

621
00:40:48,342 --> 00:40:52,005
Nonsense! You only say that
because no one ever has.

622
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:21,033
It's not that bad.

623
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,639
I'm not saying I'd like
to build a summer home here...

624
00:41:25,678 --> 00:41:27,703
but the trees
are actually quite lovely.

625
00:42:05,518 --> 00:42:08,544
Well, now,
that was an adventure.

626
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:10,715
Singed a bit, were you?

627
00:42:10,757 --> 00:42:11,917
You?

628
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:21,322
One thing I will say...

629
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:25,861
the fire swamp certainly does
keep you on your toes.

630
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:33,343
This will all soon be
but a happy memory...

631
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:36,177
because Roberts' ship Revenge
is anchored at the far end...

632
00:42:36,215 --> 00:42:38,342
and I, as you know, am Roberts.

633
00:42:38,384 --> 00:42:39,681
How is that possible...

634
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,346
since he's been
marauding twenty years...

635
00:42:41,387 --> 00:42:43,855
and you only left me
five years ago?

636
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:48,350
I myself am often surprised
at life's little quirks.

637
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:53,354
What I told you before
about saying please was true.

638
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:54,866
It intrigued Roberts...

639
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:57,870
as did my description
of your beauty.

640
00:42:57,904 --> 00:42:59,872
Finally,
Roberts decided something.

641
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:03,808
He said, "All right, Westley,
I've never had a valet.

642
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:05,811
"You can try it for tonight.

643
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:08,313
"I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

644
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:10,315
Three years he said that.

645
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:12,510
"Good night, Westley,
good work. Sleep well.

646
00:43:12,552 --> 00:43:14,816
"I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

647
00:43:14,854 --> 00:43:16,321
It was a fine time for me.

648
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:19,813
I was learning to fence, fight,
anything anyone would teach me.

649
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,827
And Roberts and I
eventually became friends...

650
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:23,829
and then it happened.

651
00:43:23,863 --> 00:43:25,956
What? Go on.

652
00:43:25,998 --> 00:43:29,331
Roberts had grown so rich,
he wanted to retire...

653
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:33,304
so he took me to his cabin
and told me his secret.

654
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:35,830
"I am not the Dread Pirate
Roberts," he said.

655
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,139
"My name is Ryan.

656
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:40,873
"I inherited the ship
from the previous Roberts...

657
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:42,881
"just as you will inherit it
from me.

658
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:46,043
"The man I inherited it from
wasn't the real Roberts, either.

659
00:43:46,085 --> 00:43:47,848
"His name was Cumberbund.

660
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:50,856
"The real Roberts has been
retired fifteen years...

661
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,653
"and living like a king."
Thank you.

662
00:43:52,692 --> 00:43:55,354
Then he explained the name
was the important thing...

663
00:43:55,394 --> 00:43:57,362
for inspiring
the necessary fear.

664
00:43:57,396 --> 00:44:01,332
You see, no one would surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

665
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:04,803
So we sailed ashore,
took on an entirely new crew.

666
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:07,305
And he stayed aboard
for a while as first mate...

667
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,807
all the time calling me Roberts.

668
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:11,309
Once the crew believed,
he left the ship...

669
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,312
and I have been Roberts
ever since.

670
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,337
Except,
now that we're together...

671
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:17,849
I shall retire and hand the name
over to someone else.

672
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:19,818
Is everything clear to you?

673
00:45:52,178 --> 00:45:55,272
We'll never succeed.

674
00:45:55,314 --> 00:45:57,782
We may as well die here.

675
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:03,445
No, we have already succeeded.

676
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,690
I mean, what are the three
terrors of the Fire Swamp?

677
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:11,822
One, the flame spurt.
No problem.

678
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:13,764
There's a popping sound
preceding each.

679
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:15,767
We can avoid that.

680
00:46:15,801 --> 00:46:17,268
Two, the lightning sand.

681
00:46:17,303 --> 00:46:19,271
But you were clever enough to
discover what that looks like...

682
00:46:19,305 --> 00:46:21,535
so in the future,
we can avoid that, too.

683
00:46:21,574 --> 00:46:23,872
Westley,
what about the R.O.U.S. S?

684
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,274
Rodents of Unusual Size?

685
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:27,541
I don't think they exist.

686
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:20,782
We did it.

687
00:48:22,294 --> 00:48:24,524
Now, was that so terrible?

688
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,168
Surrender!

689
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,074
You mean you wish to surrender
to me?

690
00:48:39,111 --> 00:48:40,305
Very well. I accept.

691
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:42,780
I give you full marks
for bravery.

692
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:44,874
Don't make yourself a fool.

693
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:46,077
But how will you capture us?

694
00:48:46,118 --> 00:48:47,779
We know the secrets
of the Fire Swamp.

695
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,788
We can live there quite happily
for some time...

696
00:48:49,822 --> 00:48:52,052
so whenever you feel like dying,
feel free to visit.

697
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:55,288
I tell you once again,
surrender!

698
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:56,851
It will not happen.

699
00:48:56,896 --> 00:48:59,091
For the last time, surrender!

700
00:48:59,131 --> 00:49:00,462
Death first!

701
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:02,467
Will you promise
not to hurt him?!

702
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:04,992
- What was that?
- What was that?

703
00:49:05,037 --> 00:49:08,234
If we surrender
and I return with you...

704
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:11,641
will you promise
not to hurt this man?

705
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:15,272
May I live a thousand years
and never hunt again.

706
00:49:15,314 --> 00:49:18,283
He is a sailor
on the pirate ship Revenge.

707
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:20,683
Promise to return him
to his ship.

708
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:23,279
I swear it will be done.

709
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,392
Once we're out of sight,
take him back to Florin...

710
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:29,792
and throw him
in the Pit of Despair.

711
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:32,491
I swear it will be done.

712
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:37,434
I thought you were dead once,
and it almost destroyed me.

713
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,995
I could not bear it
if you died again...

714
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:42,872
not when I could save you.

715
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:56,220
Come, sir.

716
00:49:56,255 --> 00:49:58,553
We must get you to your ship.

717
00:50:05,264 --> 00:50:07,232
We are men of action.

718
00:50:07,266 --> 00:50:09,598
Lies do not become us.

719
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:12,832
Well spoken, sir.

720
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:21,375
What is it?

721
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:23,813
You have six fingers
on your right hand.

722
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:26,986
Someone was looking for you.

723
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,695
Where am I?

724
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:15,256
The Pit of Despair.

725
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,665
Don't even think...

726
00:51:19,805 --> 00:51:22,273
Don't even think about
trying to escape.

727
00:51:22,307 --> 00:51:24,366
The chains are far too thick.

728
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:27,038
And don't dream
of being rescued, either.

729
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:29,070
The only way in is secret.

730
00:51:29,114 --> 00:51:30,979
Only the prince,
the count, and I...

731
00:51:31,016 --> 00:51:33,280
know how to get in and out.

732
00:51:33,318 --> 00:51:35,252
Then I'm here till I die?

733
00:51:35,287 --> 00:51:37,590
Till they kill you, yeah.

734
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:44,087
Then why bother curing me?

735
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:47,257
The prince and count insist
on everyone being healthy...

736
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:48,789
before they're broken.

737
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:50,358
So it's to be torture.

738
00:51:51,637 --> 00:51:53,901
I can cope with torture.

739
00:51:55,507 --> 00:51:57,975
You don't believe me?

740
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,274
You survived the Fire Swamp.

741
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:02,280
You must be very brave...

742
00:52:02,314 --> 00:52:05,511
but nobody
withstands the Machine.

743
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:22,767
She's been like that
ever since the Fire Swamp.

744
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:27,261
It's my father's failing health
that's upsetting her.

745
00:52:27,306 --> 00:52:28,796
Of course.

746
00:52:30,476 --> 00:52:34,276
The king died that very night...

747
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:36,781
and before the following dawn...

748
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:39,409
Buttercup and Humperdinck
were married.

749
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:41,715
And at noon,
she met her subjects again...

750
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:43,654
this time, as their queen.

751
00:52:43,689 --> 00:52:46,214
My father's final words were...

752
00:52:46,258 --> 00:52:48,249
Hold it! Hold it, Grandpa.

753
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:49,726
You read that wrong.

754
00:52:49,762 --> 00:52:52,390
She doesn't marry Humperdinck.
She marries Westley.

755
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:53,762
I'm just sure of it.

756
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:55,858
After all that Westley
did for her...

757
00:52:55,901 --> 00:52:58,893
if she didn't marry him,
it wouldn't be fair.

758
00:52:58,937 --> 00:53:00,734
Who says life is fair?

759
00:53:00,773 --> 00:53:02,240
Where is that written?

760
00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:04,333
Life isn't always fair.

761
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:06,867
I'm telling you,
you're messing up the story!

762
00:53:06,912 --> 00:53:08,402
Now, get it right!

763
00:53:08,447 --> 00:53:10,711
Do you want me
to go on with this?

764
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:14,252
All right, then,
no more interruptions.

765
00:53:14,286 --> 00:53:16,754
"At noon,
she met her subjects again...

766
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:18,984
this time, as their queen."

767
00:53:19,024 --> 00:53:22,255
My father's final words were...

768
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:27,857
"Love her as I loved her,
and there will be joy."

769
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,926
I present to you your queen!

770
00:53:30,969 --> 00:53:34,564
Queen Buttercup!

771
00:53:52,057 --> 00:53:53,524
Why do you do this?

772
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:57,461
You had love in your hands,
and you gave it up!

773
00:53:57,496 --> 00:53:59,987
They would have killed Westley
if I hadn't done it.

774
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:03,229
Your true love lives,
and you marry another!

775
00:54:03,268 --> 00:54:06,726
True love saved her
in the Fire Swamp...

776
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:08,740
and she treated it like garbage!

777
00:54:08,774 --> 00:54:12,540
And that's what she is...
the Queen of Refuse!

778
00:54:12,578 --> 00:54:15,342
So bow down to her if you want!
Bow to her!

779
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,746
Bow to the Queen of Slime!

780
00:54:17,783 --> 00:54:19,250
The Queen of Filth!

781
00:54:19,284 --> 00:54:21,377
The Queen of Putrescence!

782
00:54:23,622 --> 00:54:28,082
Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck!

783
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:36,130
It was ten days
till the wedding.

784
00:54:36,168 --> 00:54:37,999
The king still lived.

785
00:54:38,036 --> 00:54:41,403
But Buttercup's nightmares
were growing steadily worse.

786
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,841
See? Didn't I say she'd never
marry that rotten Humperdinck?

787
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:46,970
Yes, you're very smart.
Shut up.

788
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,706
It comes to this.

789
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:51,944
I love Westley. I always have.

790
00:54:51,984 --> 00:54:54,350
I know now I always will.

791
00:54:54,386 --> 00:54:57,514
If you tell me I must marry you
in ten days...

792
00:54:57,556 --> 00:55:00,116
please believe
I will be dead by morning.

793
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:10,223
I could never cause you grief.

794
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:12,260
Consider our wedding off.

795
00:55:13,672 --> 00:55:16,072
You returned this...

796
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:18,269
Westley to his ship?

797
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:21,644
Then we will simply alert him.

798
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:28,586
Beloved... are you certain
he still wants you?

799
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:32,818
After all, it was you who did
the leaving in the Fire Swamp.

800
00:55:32,858 --> 00:55:37,227
Not to mention that pirates are
not known as men of their words.

801
00:55:37,262 --> 00:55:39,730
My Westley
will always come for me.

802
00:55:46,238 --> 00:55:48,263
I suggest a deal.

803
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:51,435
You write four copies
of a letter.

804
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:54,877
I'll send my four fastest ships,
one in each direction.

805
00:55:54,913 --> 00:55:56,175
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

806
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:58,240
is always close to Florin
this time of year.

807
00:55:58,283 --> 00:56:01,218
We'll run up the white flag
and deliver your message.

808
00:56:01,253 --> 00:56:04,586
If Westley wants you,
bless you both.

809
00:56:04,623 --> 00:56:06,921
If not...

810
00:56:10,295 --> 00:56:13,992
please consider me
as an alternative to suicide.

811
00:56:14,032 --> 00:56:16,296
Are we agreed?

812
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:23,707
Your princess is really
quite a winning creature.

813
00:56:23,742 --> 00:56:26,370
A trifle simple, perhaps,
but her appeal is undeniable.

814
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,538
I know. The people
are quite taken with her.

815
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,947
It's odd,
but when I hired Vizzini...

816
00:56:31,984 --> 00:56:33,815
to have her murdered
on our engagement day...

817
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,012
I thought that was clever.

818
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:36,577
But it's going to be
so much more moving...

819
00:56:36,622 --> 00:56:39,216
when I strangle her
on our wedding night.

820
00:56:39,258 --> 00:56:40,691
Once Guilder is blamed...

821
00:56:40,726 --> 00:56:42,660
the nation
will be truly outraged.

822
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:45,026
They'll demand we go to war.

823
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:51,224
Now, where is that secret knot?

824
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,568
It's impossible to find.

825
00:56:56,275 --> 00:56:59,176
Are you coming down
into the pit?

826
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:00,735
Westley's got his strength back.

827
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:03,304
I'm starting him
on the Machine tonight.

828
00:57:03,348 --> 00:57:07,045
Tyrone, you know how much
I love watching you work...

829
00:57:07,085 --> 00:57:10,612
but I've got my country's
500th anniversary to plan...

830
00:57:10,656 --> 00:57:13,090
my wedding to arrange,
my wife to murder...

831
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:16,526
and Guilder to frame for it.
I'm swamped.

832
00:57:19,498 --> 00:57:21,261
Get some rest.

833
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:24,235
If you haven't got your health,
you haven't got anything.

834
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,276
Beautiful, isn't it?

835
00:57:42,321 --> 00:57:46,655
It took me half a lifetime
to invent it.

836
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:48,216
I'm sure you've discovered...

837
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,922
my deep and abiding interest
in pain.

838
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:52,521
At present, I'm writing
the definitive work...

839
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:54,156
on the subject.

840
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:56,326
So I want you to be
totally honest with me...

841
00:57:56,368 --> 00:57:58,563
on how the Machine
makes you feel.

842
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:03,267
This being our first try,
I'll use the lowest setting.

843
00:58:38,744 --> 00:58:41,713
As you know, the concept
of the suction pump...

844
00:58:41,747 --> 00:58:43,314
is centuries old.

845
00:58:43,447 --> 00:58:45,711
Well, really,
that's all this is.

846
00:58:45,749 --> 00:58:48,149
Except that,
instead of sucking water...

847
00:58:48,185 --> 00:58:50,210
I'm sucking life.

848
00:58:50,254 --> 00:58:53,781
I've just sucked
one year of your life away.

849
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:56,884
I might one day
go as high as five...

850
00:58:56,927 --> 00:58:59,725
but I really don't know
what that would do to you...

851
00:58:59,763 --> 00:59:02,027
so let's just start
with what we have.

852
00:59:02,066 --> 00:59:05,365
What did this do to you?
Tell me.

853
00:59:05,402 --> 00:59:07,233
And remember,
this is for posterity...

854
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:08,738
so be honest.

855
00:59:08,772 --> 00:59:10,899
How do you feel?

856
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:16,803
Interesting.

857
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,417
Yellin.

858
00:59:28,459 --> 00:59:29,926
Sire.

859
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:44,232
As chief enforcer of all Florin,
I trust you with this secret.

860
00:59:44,274 --> 00:59:45,798
Killers from Guilder...

861
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:47,470
are infiltrating
the Thieves' Forest...

862
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:52,244
and plan to murder my bride
on our wedding night.

863
00:59:52,282 --> 00:59:55,115
My spy network
has heard no such news.

864
00:59:55,152 --> 00:59:56,517
Any word from Westley?

865
00:59:58,288 --> 01:00:00,688
Too soon, my angel.

866
01:00:00,724 --> 01:00:02,157
Patience.

867
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:03,489
He will come for me.

868
01:00:03,527 --> 01:00:05,358
Of course.

869
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,768
She will not be murdered.

870
01:00:11,802 --> 01:00:13,099
On the day of the wedding...

871
01:00:13,137 --> 01:00:14,764
I want the Thieves' Forest
emptied...

872
01:00:14,805 --> 01:00:17,535
and every inhabitant arrested.

873
01:00:17,574 --> 01:00:19,269
Many of the thieves will resist.

874
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:22,005
My regular enforcers
will be inadequate.

875
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:24,206
Form a brute squad, then!

876
01:00:24,248 --> 01:00:27,308
I want the Thieves' Forest
emptied before I wed.

877
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:29,012
It won't be easy, sire.

878
01:00:29,052 --> 01:00:31,247
Try ruling the world sometime.

879
01:00:35,826 --> 01:00:38,226
The day of the wedding arrived.

880
01:00:38,262 --> 01:00:41,231
The brute squad
had their hands full...

881
01:00:41,265 --> 01:00:43,233
carrying out
Humperdinck's orders.

882
01:00:43,267 --> 01:00:45,735
Up! Up! Up!

883
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:49,136
Come on! Come on!

884
01:00:49,173 --> 01:00:50,640
- Is everybody out?
- Almost.

885
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:52,733
There's a Spaniard
giving us some trouble.

886
01:00:52,776 --> 01:00:55,040
Well, you give him some trouble.

887
01:00:56,146 --> 01:00:57,306
Move.

888
01:01:01,552 --> 01:01:03,747
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.

889
01:01:03,787 --> 01:01:09,419
You told me to go back
to the beginning, so I have.

890
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:13,829
This is where I am,
and this is where I'll stay.

891
01:01:13,864 --> 01:01:16,492
I will not be moved.

892
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:17,898
Ho there!

893
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:21,302
I do not budge.
Keep your "ho there."

894
01:01:21,338 --> 01:01:22,930
The prince gave orders.

895
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:27,570
So did Vizzini.

896
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:30,011
When a job went wrong,
you went back to the beginning.

897
01:01:30,047 --> 01:01:33,847
This is where we got the job,
so it's the beginning.

898
01:01:33,884 --> 01:01:35,875
And I am staying
till Vizzini come.

899
01:01:35,919 --> 01:01:37,352
You brute, come here!

900
01:01:37,387 --> 01:01:42,848
I am waiting for Vizzini.

901
01:01:42,893 --> 01:01:45,384
You surely are a meanie.

902
01:01:54,404 --> 01:01:56,133
It's you.

903
01:01:56,173 --> 01:01:57,936
True.

904
01:01:59,476 --> 01:02:01,410
You don't look so good.

905
01:02:02,913 --> 01:02:05,575
You don't smell so good, either.

906
01:02:05,616 --> 01:02:07,379
Perhaps not.

907
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:09,248
I feel fine.

908
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:15,950
Fezzik and Inigo were reunited.

909
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:19,451
As Fezzik nursed his inebriated
friend back to health...

910
01:02:19,496 --> 01:02:21,794
he told Inigo
of Vizzini's death...

911
01:02:21,832 --> 01:02:23,459
and the existence
of Count Rugen...

912
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,797
the six-fingered man.

913
01:02:24,835 --> 01:02:27,360
Considering Inigo's
lifelong search...

914
01:02:27,404 --> 01:02:29,929
he handled the news
surprisingly well.

915
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:35,502
Fezzik took great care
in reviving Inigo.

916
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:36,979
That's enough!

917
01:02:38,715 --> 01:02:42,151
Where is this Rugen now
so I may kill him?

918
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:44,380
He's with the prince
in the castle...

919
01:02:44,421 --> 01:02:47,481
but the castle gate
is guarded by thirty men.

920
01:02:51,595 --> 01:02:53,859
How many could you handle?

921
01:02:53,897 --> 01:02:56,058
I don't think more than ten.

922
01:03:00,938 --> 01:03:02,530
Leaving twenty for me.

923
01:03:03,941 --> 01:03:06,205
At my best,
I could never defeat that many.

924
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,116
I need Vizzini to plan.
I have no gift for strategy.

925
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:14,845
But Vizzini is dead.

926
01:03:14,885 --> 01:03:18,912
No. Not Vizzini.

927
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:21,322
I need the man in black.

928
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:22,552
What?

929
01:03:22,593 --> 01:03:25,426
He bested you with strength,
your greatness.

930
01:03:25,462 --> 01:03:27,430
He bested me with steel.

931
01:03:27,464 --> 01:03:29,932
He must have
out-thought Vizzini.

932
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:34,529
A man who can do that can plan
my castle onslaught any day.

933
01:03:34,571 --> 01:03:35,663
- Let's go.
- Where?

934
01:03:35,706 --> 01:03:37,640
Find the man in black,
obviously.

935
01:03:37,674 --> 01:03:39,039
But you don't know where he is.

936
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:40,566
Don't bother me with trifles.

937
01:03:40,611 --> 01:03:41,737
After twenty years, at last...

938
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:43,871
my father's soul
will be at peace.

939
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:45,882
There will be blood tonight!

940
01:03:56,326 --> 01:03:58,624
Rise and report.

941
01:03:58,662 --> 01:04:00,527
The Thieves' Forest is emptied.

942
01:04:00,564 --> 01:04:01,826
Thirty men
guard the castle gate.

943
01:04:01,865 --> 01:04:03,457
Double it.

944
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,331
My princess must be safe.

945
01:04:05,369 --> 01:04:07,860
The gate has but one key...

946
01:04:07,904 --> 01:04:11,237
and I carry that.

947
01:04:14,878 --> 01:04:16,869
My dulcet darling!

948
01:04:18,982 --> 01:04:21,109
Tonight, we marry.

949
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:24,552
Tomorrow morning, your men will
escort us to Florin Channel...

950
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:26,852
where every ship in my armada...

951
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:29,882
waits to accompany us
on our honeymoon.

952
01:04:29,926 --> 01:04:32,486
Every ship
but your four fastest, you mean.

953
01:04:34,965 --> 01:04:37,365
Every ship
but the four you sent.

954
01:04:37,401 --> 01:04:39,301
Yes, of course.

955
01:04:39,336 --> 01:04:41,395
Naturally, not those four.

956
01:04:42,939 --> 01:04:45,066
Your Majesties.

957
01:04:48,745 --> 01:04:50,770
You never sent the ships.

958
01:04:50,814 --> 01:04:53,374
Don't bother lying.

959
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:54,816
It doesn't matter.

960
01:04:54,851 --> 01:04:56,842
Westley will come for me,
anyway.

961
01:04:56,887 --> 01:04:58,752
You're a silly girl.

962
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:00,313
Yes, I am a silly girl...

963
01:05:00,357 --> 01:05:03,520
for not having seen sooner that
you were nothing but a coward...

964
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,687
with a heart full of fear.

965
01:05:05,729 --> 01:05:10,496
I would not say such things
if I were you.

966
01:05:10,534 --> 01:05:13,332
Why not? You can't hurt me.

967
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:17,431
Westley and I are joined
by the bonds of love...

968
01:05:17,474 --> 01:05:19,339
and you cannot track that...

969
01:05:19,376 --> 01:05:22,106
not with
a thousand bloodhounds...

970
01:05:22,145 --> 01:05:24,340
and you cannot break it...

971
01:05:24,381 --> 01:05:26,349
not with a thousand swords.

972
01:05:26,383 --> 01:05:28,351
And when I say
you are a coward...

973
01:05:28,385 --> 01:05:30,353
that is only because you are
the slimiest weakling...

974
01:05:30,387 --> 01:05:32,412
ever to crawl the earth.

975
01:05:34,424 --> 01:05:38,451
I would not say such things
if I were you!

976
01:05:52,843 --> 01:05:54,811
You truly love each other...

977
01:05:54,845 --> 01:05:56,836
and so you might have been
truly happy.

978
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,144
Not one couple in a century
has that chance...

979
01:05:59,182 --> 01:06:01,343
no matter what
the storybooks say.

980
01:06:01,384 --> 01:06:04,353
So I think
no man in a century...

981
01:06:04,387 --> 01:06:07,413
will suffer as greatly
as you will.

982
01:06:10,594 --> 01:06:11,822
Not to fifty!

983
01:06:34,918 --> 01:06:37,552
Listen. Do you hear?

984
01:06:37,587 --> 01:06:39,851
That is the sound
of ultimate suffering.

985
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:43,883
My heart made that sound when
Rugen slaughtered my father.

986
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:45,588
The man in black makes it now.

987
01:06:45,629 --> 01:06:46,891
The man in black?

988
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,761
His true love
is marrying another tonight.

989
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,131
Who else has the cause
for ultimate suffering?

990
01:06:51,168 --> 01:06:54,331
Excuse me.
Pardon me, it's important.

991
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:55,861
Fezzik, please.

992
01:06:55,906 --> 01:06:57,430
Everybody, move!

993
01:06:57,474 --> 01:06:58,873
Thank you.

994
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:10,011
Where is the man in black?

995
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:12,283
You get there
from this grove, yes?

996
01:07:13,623 --> 01:07:15,887
Fezzik, jog his memory.

997
01:07:20,363 --> 01:07:22,354
I'm sorry, Inigo.

998
01:07:22,398 --> 01:07:25,333
I didn't mean
to jog him so hard.

999
01:07:28,505 --> 01:07:33,875
Father, I have failed you
for twenty years.

1000
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:36,378
Now our misery can end.

1001
01:07:36,412 --> 01:07:38,312
Somewhere...

1002
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:43,308
somewhere close by
is a man who can help us.

1003
01:07:43,353 --> 01:07:46,322
I cannot find him alone.

1004
01:07:46,356 --> 01:07:49,325
I need you.

1005
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:52,328
I need you to guide my sword.

1006
01:07:52,362 --> 01:07:53,886
Please.

1007
01:07:55,365 --> 01:07:57,856
Guide my sword.

1008
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:49,511
He's dead.

1009
01:08:49,552 --> 01:08:52,020
It just is not fair.

1010
01:08:52,055 --> 01:08:53,920
Grandpa, wait!

1011
01:08:53,957 --> 01:08:58,485
Wait. What did Fezzik mean,
"He's dead"?

1012
01:08:58,528 --> 01:09:01,326
I mean, he didn't mean dead.

1013
01:09:01,364 --> 01:09:04,891
Westley's only faking... right?

1014
01:09:04,934 --> 01:09:07,630
You want me to read this or not?

1015
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,900
Who gets Humperdinck?

1016
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:11,804
I don't understand.

1017
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:14,833
Who kills Prince Humperdinck
at the end?

1018
01:09:14,877 --> 01:09:16,845
Somebody's got to do it.

1019
01:09:16,879 --> 01:09:18,210
Is it Inigo? Who?

1020
01:09:18,247 --> 01:09:21,341
Nobody. Nobody kills him.

1021
01:09:21,384 --> 01:09:22,749
He lives.

1022
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:24,377
You mean he wins?

1023
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,617
Jesus, Grandpa, what did you
read me this thing for?

1024
01:09:27,657 --> 01:09:29,386
You've been very sick...

1025
01:09:29,425 --> 01:09:32,883
and you're taking this story
very seriously.

1026
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:35,898
I think we ought to stop now.

1027
01:09:35,932 --> 01:09:37,957
No. I'm OK.

1028
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:40,868
Sit down. I'm all right.

1029
01:09:42,405 --> 01:09:45,636
All right, now,
let's see, where were we?

1030
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:50,369
In the Pit of Despair.

1031
01:09:55,118 --> 01:09:56,847
We Montoyas
have never taken defeat easily.

1032
01:09:56,886 --> 01:09:59,446
Come along, Fezzik.
Bring the body.

1033
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:01,013
The body?

1034
01:10:01,057 --> 01:10:02,820
Have you any money?

1035
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:04,156
I have a little.

1036
01:10:04,193 --> 01:10:08,254
I just hope it's enough
to buy a miracle, that's all.

1037
01:10:12,402 --> 01:10:14,063
Go away!

1038
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:18,606
What? What?

1039
01:10:18,641 --> 01:10:19,767
Are you the Miracle Max...

1040
01:10:19,809 --> 01:10:21,538
who worked for the king
all those years?

1041
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:23,374
The king's stinking son
fired me.

1042
01:10:23,413 --> 01:10:26,405
And thank you for bringing up
such a painful subject.

1043
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:28,440
While you're at it, why don't
you give me a nice paper cut...

1044
01:10:28,484 --> 01:10:29,781
and pour lemon juice on it?

1045
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:30,979
We're closed!

1046
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:36,486
Beat it,
or I'll call the brute squad.

1047
01:10:36,526 --> 01:10:37,959
I'm on the brute squad.

1048
01:10:37,994 --> 01:10:39,655
You are the brute squad.

1049
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:41,994
We need a miracle.
It's very important.

1050
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:44,158
Look, I'm retired.
And besides...

1051
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,691
why would you want someone
the king's stinking son fired?

1052
01:10:46,736 --> 01:10:48,931
I might kill whoever
you wanted me to miracle.

1053
01:10:48,971 --> 01:10:50,336
He's already dead.

1054
01:10:50,373 --> 01:10:51,897
He is, huh?

1055
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:54,739
I'll take a look. Bring him in.

1056
01:11:07,957 --> 01:11:09,948
I've seen worse.

1057
01:11:15,465 --> 01:11:16,625
Sir?

1058
01:11:19,302 --> 01:11:21,361
We're in a terrible rush.

1059
01:11:21,404 --> 01:11:22,530
Don't rush me, sonny.

1060
01:11:22,572 --> 01:11:24,938
You rush a miracle man,
you get rotten miracles.

1061
01:11:24,974 --> 01:11:26,464
You got money?

1062
01:11:26,509 --> 01:11:27,703
Sixty-five.

1063
01:11:27,744 --> 01:11:30,440
I never worked for so little...

1064
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,176
except once,
and that was a very noble cause.

1065
01:11:33,216 --> 01:11:35,411
This is noble, sir.

1066
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:37,442
His wife is crippled.

1067
01:11:37,487 --> 01:11:42,220
His children
are on the brink of starvation.

1068
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:44,590
Are you a rotten liar!

1069
01:11:44,627 --> 01:11:46,788
I need him
to help avenge my father...

1070
01:11:46,829 --> 01:11:48,524
murdered these twenty years.

1071
01:11:48,564 --> 01:11:51,328
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows?

1072
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:54,632
He probably owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.

1073
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,262
He's dead. He can't talk.

1074
01:11:56,305 --> 01:11:58,933
Look who knows so much, huh?

1075
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:03,935
It just so happens your friend
is only mostly dead.

1076
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:07,882
There's a big difference between
mostly dead and all dead.

1077
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,612
Please open his mouth.

1078
01:12:09,652 --> 01:12:14,453
Now, mostly dead
is slightly alive.

1079
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:17,084
Now, all dead...
well, with all dead...

1080
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:19,720
there's usually only one thing
that you can do.

1081
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:21,127
What's that?

1082
01:12:21,164 --> 01:12:23,997
Go through his clothes
and look for loose change.

1083
01:12:30,573 --> 01:12:32,473
Hello in there!

1084
01:12:32,508 --> 01:12:34,976
What's so important?

1085
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:37,946
What you got here
that's worth living for?

1086
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:44,919
Tr-u-u-ue lo-o-o-ove.

1087
01:12:44,954 --> 01:12:46,888
True love. You heard him?

1088
01:12:46,923 --> 01:12:49,084
You could not ask for
a more noble cause than that.

1089
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:50,422
Hey, sonny...

1090
01:12:50,459 --> 01:12:52,450
true love is the greatest thing
in the world...

1091
01:12:52,495 --> 01:12:54,759
except for a nice M.L.T...

1092
01:12:54,797 --> 01:12:56,424
mutton, lettuce,
and tomato sandwich...

1093
01:12:56,465 --> 01:13:00,333
when the mutton is nice and lean
and the tomato is ripe.

1094
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:01,734
They're so perky. I love that.

1095
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:02,999
But that's not what he said.

1096
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:05,906
He distinctly said,
"To bl-a-a-ave."

1097
01:13:05,942 --> 01:13:08,467
And as we all know,
to blave means to bluff, huh?

1098
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:10,979
So you were probably playing
cards, and he cheated...

1099
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:14,312
Liar!

1100
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:15,476
Get back, witch!

1101
01:13:15,518 --> 01:13:16,951
I'm not a witch! I'm your wife!

1102
01:13:16,986 --> 01:13:18,453
But after what you just said...

1103
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:20,751
I'm not even sure
I want to be that anymore!

1104
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:22,280
You never had it so good.

1105
01:13:22,325 --> 01:13:23,758
He said true love, Max.

1106
01:13:23,793 --> 01:13:25,124
Don't say another word, Valerie!

1107
01:13:25,161 --> 01:13:26,287
He's afraid.

1108
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:27,990
Ever since Prince Humperdinck
fired him...

1109
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,292
his confidence is shattered.

1110
01:13:29,332 --> 01:13:30,492
Why'd you say that name?

1111
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:32,592
You promised me that
you would never say that name!

1112
01:13:32,635 --> 01:13:34,967
What? Humperdinck?

1113
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:40,233
I'm not listening!

1114
01:13:40,276 --> 01:13:41,766
A life expiring...

1115
01:13:41,811 --> 01:13:44,439
and you don't have the decency
to say why you won't help!

1116
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,948
- Nobody's hearing nothing!
- Humperdinck!

1117
01:13:46,983 --> 01:13:48,917
This is Buttercup's true love.

1118
01:13:48,951 --> 01:13:51,647
If you heal him, he will stop
Humperdinck's wedding.

1119
01:13:51,687 --> 01:13:53,712
Shut up!
Wait a minute.

1120
01:13:53,756 --> 01:13:55,747
I make him better,
Humperdinck suffers?

1121
01:13:55,791 --> 01:13:58,555
Humiliations galore!

1122
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:03,655
That is a noble cause.

1123
01:14:03,699 --> 01:14:06,634
Give me the sixty-five.
I'm on the job.

1124
01:14:10,306 --> 01:14:12,137
That's a miracle pill?

1125
01:14:12,174 --> 01:14:14,904
The chocolate coating
makes it go down easier...

1126
01:14:14,944 --> 01:14:18,243
but you have to wait 15 minutes
for full potency...

1127
01:14:18,281 --> 01:14:21,478
and you shouldn't go swimming
for at least, what?

1128
01:14:21,517 --> 01:14:23,985
- An hour. A good hour.
- Yeah, an hour.

1129
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:25,749
Thank you for everything.

1130
01:14:25,788 --> 01:14:27,153
Bye-bye, boys.

1131
01:14:27,189 --> 01:14:29,157
Have fun storming the castle.

1132
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:30,658
Think it'll work?

1133
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:32,388
It would take a miracle.

1134
01:14:42,403 --> 01:14:43,563
Anything?

1135
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:49,102
Inigo, there's more than thirty.

1136
01:14:49,144 --> 01:14:51,442
What's the difference?

1137
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:53,447
We've got him.

1138
01:14:53,481 --> 01:14:55,005
Help me here.

1139
01:14:55,049 --> 01:14:57,142
We'll have to force-feed him.

1140
01:14:57,185 --> 01:14:58,675
Has it been fifteen minutes?

1141
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,950
We can't wait.
The wedding's in half an hour.

1142
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:03,549
We must strike in the hustle
and bustle beforehand.

1143
01:15:03,591 --> 01:15:04,956
Tilt his head back.

1144
01:15:04,993 --> 01:15:07,791
Open his mouth.

1145
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,529
How long do we have to wait...

1146
01:15:13,568 --> 01:15:15,263
before if we know
the miracle works?

1147
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:16,964
Your guess is as good as mine.

1148
01:15:17,005 --> 01:15:19,439
I'll beat you apart!
I'll take you both together!

1149
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,408
I guess not very long.

1150
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:24,501
Why won't my arms move?

1151
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:26,411
You've been mostly dead all day.

1152
01:15:26,447 --> 01:15:30,178
We had Miracle Max
make a pill to bring you back.

1153
01:15:30,218 --> 01:15:31,981
Who are you?

1154
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,351
Are we enemies?

1155
01:15:33,388 --> 01:15:34,946
Why am I on this wall?

1156
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:36,320
Where's Buttercup?

1157
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:37,688
Let me explain.

1158
01:15:37,725 --> 01:15:39,716
No, there is too much.
Let me sum up.

1159
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:42,525
Buttercup's marrying Humperdinck
in less than half an hour...

1160
01:15:42,564 --> 01:15:45,192
so all we have to do is get in,
break up the wedding...

1161
01:15:45,233 --> 01:15:46,962
steal the princess,
make our escape...

1162
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,832
after I kill Count Rugen.

1163
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:50,929
That doesn't leave much time
for dilly-dallying.

1164
01:15:50,972 --> 01:15:53,133
You just wiggled your finger!

1165
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:54,664
That's wonderful!

1166
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:56,370
I've always been a quick healer.

1167
01:15:56,411 --> 01:15:57,673
What are our liabilities?

1168
01:15:57,712 --> 01:16:00,044
There is but one
working castle gate.

1169
01:16:00,081 --> 01:16:01,309
Come on.

1170
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:07,181
And it is guarded
by sixty men.

1171
01:16:07,222 --> 01:16:08,689
And our assets?

1172
01:16:08,723 --> 01:16:11,214
Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
my steel.

1173
01:16:11,259 --> 01:16:12,658
That's it?

1174
01:16:12,694 --> 01:16:13,991
Lmpossible.

1175
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:15,996
If I had a month to plan...

1176
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,328
maybe I could come up
with something, but this...

1177
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,061
You just shook your head!

1178
01:16:20,101 --> 01:16:21,830
That doesn't make you happy?

1179
01:16:24,906 --> 01:16:27,170
My brains, his steel...

1180
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,233
and your strength
against sixty men...

1181
01:16:29,277 --> 01:16:32,769
and a little head jiggle
is supposed to make me happy?

1182
01:16:33,982 --> 01:16:37,645
If we only had a wheelbarrow,
that would be something.

1183
01:16:37,685 --> 01:16:40,085
Where did we put the wheelbarrow
the albino had?

1184
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:41,816
Over the albino, I think.

1185
01:16:41,856 --> 01:16:45,986
Why didn't you list that among
our assets in the first place?

1186
01:16:47,662 --> 01:16:49,755
What I wouldn't give
for a holocaust cloak.

1187
01:16:49,797 --> 01:16:51,458
There we cannot help you.

1188
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,024
Will this do?

1189
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,559
- Where did you get that?
- At Miracle Max's.

1190
01:16:56,604 --> 01:16:58,834
It fit so nice,
he said I could keep it.

1191
01:16:58,873 --> 01:17:01,137
All right. Come on, help me up.

1192
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:05,068
I'll need a sword eventually.

1193
01:17:05,113 --> 01:17:06,978
Why? You can't even lift one.

1194
01:17:07,015 --> 01:17:09,506
True, but that's hardly
common knowledge, is it?

1195
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:10,983
Thank you.

1196
01:17:11,019 --> 01:17:13,988
There may be problems
once we're inside.

1197
01:17:14,022 --> 01:17:16,718
I'll say.
How do I find the count?

1198
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,123
Once I do,
how do I find you again?

1199
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:19,524
Once I find you again,
how do we escape?

1200
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,993
Don't pester him.

1201
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:23,224
He's had a hard day.

1202
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,528
Right, right. Sorry.

1203
01:17:29,304 --> 01:17:31,499
- Inigo.
- What?

1204
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:33,507
I hope we win.

1205
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:36,510
You don't seem excited,
my little muffin.

1206
01:17:36,544 --> 01:17:37,943
Should I be?

1207
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:40,948
Brides often are, I'm told.

1208
01:17:40,982 --> 01:17:42,847
I do not marry tonight.

1209
01:17:44,152 --> 01:17:45,983
My Westley will save me.

1210
01:18:38,473 --> 01:18:40,441
Marriage...

1211
01:18:40,475 --> 01:18:46,004
Marriage is what brings us
together... today.

1212
01:18:46,047 --> 01:18:47,446
Marriage...

1213
01:18:47,482 --> 01:18:50,849
that blessed arrangement...

1214
01:18:50,885 --> 01:18:55,379
that dream within a dream...

1215
01:18:55,423 --> 01:18:56,720
Stand your ground, men!

1216
01:19:05,633 --> 01:19:09,660
I am the Dread Pirate Roberts.

1217
01:19:10,972 --> 01:19:14,373
There will be no survivor!

1218
01:19:14,409 --> 01:19:16,468
- Now?
- Not yet.

1219
01:19:16,511 --> 01:19:18,672
My men are here.

1220
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:21,204
I am here...

1221
01:19:21,249 --> 01:19:25,185
but soon you will not be here.

1222
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:27,050
- Now?
- Light him.

1223
01:19:30,024 --> 01:19:32,117
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

1224
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,993
takes no survivors.

1225
01:19:35,029 --> 01:19:37,896
All your worst nightmares...

1226
01:19:37,932 --> 01:19:41,163
are about to come true.

1227
01:19:41,202 --> 01:19:43,193
Then love...

1228
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,728
true love...

1229
01:19:45,773 --> 01:19:47,934
will follow you...

1230
01:19:47,975 --> 01:19:50,500
forever.

1231
01:19:50,545 --> 01:19:53,275
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

1232
01:19:53,314 --> 01:19:57,307
is here for your souls!

1233
01:19:59,053 --> 01:20:00,543
Stay where you are!

1234
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:02,556
Fight!

1235
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:05,081
Stay where you are!

1236
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:11,555
So treasure your love.

1237
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:13,396
Skip to the end.

1238
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,527
Have you the ring?

1239
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:19,164
Here comes my Westley now.

1240
01:20:19,207 --> 01:20:21,903
Fezzik, the portcullis!

1241
01:20:27,048 --> 01:20:29,380
Your Westley is dead.

1242
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:30,714
I killed him myself.

1243
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:33,481
Then why is there fear
behind your eyes?

1244
01:20:37,525 --> 01:20:39,288
Give us the gate key.

1245
01:20:39,327 --> 01:20:41,386
I have no gate key.

1246
01:20:41,429 --> 01:20:44,057
Fezzik, tear his arms off.

1247
01:20:44,098 --> 01:20:47,067
You mean this gate key?

1248
01:20:47,101 --> 01:20:50,036
...and do you,
Princess Buttercup...

1249
01:20:50,071 --> 01:20:53,040
Man and wife!
Say man and wife!

1250
01:20:53,074 --> 01:20:55,065
Man and wife.

1251
01:20:55,109 --> 01:20:57,339
Escort the bride
to the honeymoon suite.

1252
01:20:57,378 --> 01:21:00,142
I'll be there shortly.

1253
01:21:01,215 --> 01:21:03,318
He didn't come.

1254
01:21:37,151 --> 01:21:39,483
Kill the dark one
and the giant...

1255
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,818
but leave the third
for questioning.

1256
01:21:54,469 --> 01:21:57,336
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1257
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:59,897
You killed my father.

1258
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:02,409
Prepare to die.

1259
01:22:27,034 --> 01:22:28,501
I need you!

1260
01:22:28,536 --> 01:22:30,800
I can't leave him alone.

1261
01:22:30,838 --> 01:22:32,965
He's getting away from me,
Fezzik!

1262
01:22:33,007 --> 01:22:34,338
Please!

1263
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,605
I'll be right back.

1264
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,580
Thank you.

1265
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:53,559
Strange wedding.

1266
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:57,052
Yes... a very strange wedding.

1267
01:22:57,098 --> 01:22:58,622
Come along.

1268
01:23:04,906 --> 01:23:06,498
What was that for?

1269
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:08,907
Because you've always been
so kind to me.

1270
01:23:08,943 --> 01:23:10,934
And I won't be seeing you
again...

1271
01:23:10,978 --> 01:23:13,947
since I'm killing myself once
we reach the honeymoon suite.

1272
01:23:13,981 --> 01:23:16,108
Won't that be nice?

1273
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:17,640
She kissed me!

1274
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:06,990
Sorry, Father.

1275
01:24:08,135 --> 01:24:10,433
I tried.

1276
01:24:13,341 --> 01:24:15,434
You must be
that little Spanish brat...

1277
01:24:15,476 --> 01:24:18,934
I taught a lesson to
all those years ago.

1278
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,948
Simply incredible.

1279
01:24:20,982 --> 01:24:22,973
Have you been chasing me
your whole life...

1280
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:24,951
only to fail now?

1281
01:24:24,986 --> 01:24:28,149
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

1282
01:24:29,624 --> 01:24:31,489
How marvelous.

1283
01:25:08,596 --> 01:25:10,564
There's a shortage of
perfect breasts in this world.

1284
01:25:10,598 --> 01:25:13,533
It would be a pity
to damage yours.

1285
01:25:14,969 --> 01:25:16,596
Oh, Westley, darling!

1286
01:25:19,607 --> 01:25:22,440
Westley, why won't you hold me?

1287
01:25:22,476 --> 01:25:23,602
Gently.

1288
01:25:23,644 --> 01:25:25,612
At a time like this...

1289
01:25:25,646 --> 01:25:28,615
that's all you can think to say,
gently?

1290
01:25:28,649 --> 01:25:30,640
Gently!

1291
01:25:43,497 --> 01:25:47,558
Good heavens,
are you still trying to win?

1292
01:25:49,804 --> 01:25:53,706
You've got an overdeveloped
sense of vengeance.

1293
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:56,733
It's going to get you
into trouble someday.

1294
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:14,123
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1295
01:26:14,161 --> 01:26:17,028
You killed my father.

1296
01:26:17,064 --> 01:26:18,554
Prepare to die.

1297
01:26:26,107 --> 01:26:29,008
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1298
01:26:29,043 --> 01:26:31,170
You killed my father.

1299
01:26:31,212 --> 01:26:33,043
Prepare to die.

1300
01:26:36,617 --> 01:26:39,415
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1301
01:26:39,453 --> 01:26:42,422
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

1302
01:26:42,456 --> 01:26:44,583
Stop saying that!

1303
01:26:48,562 --> 01:26:50,496
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya!

1304
01:26:50,531 --> 01:26:52,396
You killed my father!

1305
01:26:52,433 --> 01:26:54,128
Prepare to die!

1306
01:26:54,168 --> 01:26:55,533
Offer me money.

1307
01:26:56,537 --> 01:26:58,402
Power, too, promise me that.

1308
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:01,431
All that I have and more,
please.

1309
01:27:01,475 --> 01:27:04,342
Offer me everything I ask for.

1310
01:27:04,378 --> 01:27:06,437
Anything you want.

1311
01:27:08,616 --> 01:27:12,177
I want my father back,
you son of a bitch!

1312
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:28,559
Westley,
will you ever forgive me?

1313
01:27:28,603 --> 01:27:31,231
What hideous sin
have you committed lately?

1314
01:27:31,272 --> 01:27:34,935
I got married. I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.

1315
01:27:34,976 --> 01:27:37,774
It never happened.
It never happened.

1316
01:27:37,812 --> 01:27:39,143
But it did. I was there.

1317
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,613
This old man said man and wife.

1318
01:27:40,648 --> 01:27:42,377
Did you say I do?

1319
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:46,447
We sort of skipped that part.

1320
01:27:46,487 --> 01:27:47,954
Then you're not married.

1321
01:27:47,989 --> 01:27:52,085
If you didn't say it,
you didn't do it.

1322
01:27:52,126 --> 01:27:54,720
Wouldn't you agree,
Your Highness?

1323
01:27:54,762 --> 01:27:58,323
A technicality
that will shortly be remedied.

1324
01:27:59,834 --> 01:28:02,166
But first things first.

1325
01:28:03,604 --> 01:28:05,094
To the death.

1326
01:28:06,507 --> 01:28:08,065
To the pain.

1327
01:28:09,977 --> 01:28:11,638
I don't think I'm quite familiar
with that phrase.

1328
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,340
I'll explain...

1329
01:28:13,381 --> 01:28:17,147
and I'll use small words so that
you'll be sure to understand...

1330
01:28:17,185 --> 01:28:19,346
you warthog-faced buffoon.

1331
01:28:20,688 --> 01:28:23,156
That may be the first time
in my life...

1332
01:28:23,191 --> 01:28:25,853
a man has dared insult me.

1333
01:28:25,893 --> 01:28:27,554
It won't be the last.

1334
01:28:27,595 --> 01:28:30,063
To the pain means
the first thing you lose...

1335
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:32,122
will be your feet
below the ankles...

1336
01:28:32,166 --> 01:28:34,634
then your hands at the wrists...

1337
01:28:34,669 --> 01:28:36,136
next your nose.

1338
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:38,138
And then my tongue, I suppose.

1339
01:28:38,172 --> 01:28:40,640
I killed you
too quickly the last time...

1340
01:28:40,675 --> 01:28:43,007
a mistake I don't mean
to duplicate tonight.

1341
01:28:43,044 --> 01:28:44,568
I wasn't finished.

1342
01:28:44,612 --> 01:28:47,547
The next thing you lose will be
your left eye, then your right.

1343
01:28:47,582 --> 01:28:50,949
And then my ears. I understand!
Let's get on with it!

1344
01:28:50,985 --> 01:28:54,318
Wrong! Your ears you keep,
and I'll tell you why...

1345
01:28:56,257 --> 01:28:59,590
so every shriek of every child
at seeing your hideousness...

1346
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:01,561
will be yours to cherish.

1347
01:29:01,596 --> 01:29:04,292
Every babe that weeps
at your approach...

1348
01:29:04,332 --> 01:29:07,733
every woman who cries out,
"God, what is that thing"...

1349
01:29:07,768 --> 01:29:10,566
will echo in your perfect ears.

1350
01:29:10,605 --> 01:29:13,574
That is what
"to the pain" means.

1351
01:29:13,608 --> 01:29:16,577
It means I leave you
in anguish...

1352
01:29:16,611 --> 01:29:20,069
wallowing
in freakish misery forever.

1353
01:29:21,115 --> 01:29:23,208
I think you're bluffing.

1354
01:29:23,251 --> 01:29:24,684
It's possible, pig!

1355
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,687
I might be bluffing.

1356
01:29:26,721 --> 01:29:30,452
It's conceivable,
you miserable vomitous mass...

1357
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:34,086
I'm only lying here because
I lack the strength to stand.

1358
01:29:34,128 --> 01:29:36,221
Then again...

1359
01:29:37,565 --> 01:29:40,534
perhaps I have the strength
after all.

1360
01:29:56,183 --> 01:30:00,313
Drop your sword.

1361
01:30:03,558 --> 01:30:05,321
Have a seat.

1362
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:11,197
Tie him up.

1363
01:30:12,366 --> 01:30:15,199
Make it as tight as you like.

1364
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,673
Where's Fezzik?

1365
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,268
I thought he was with you.

1366
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:25,040
In that case...

1367
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:26,205
Help him.

1368
01:30:26,247 --> 01:30:28,147
Why does Westley need helping?

1369
01:30:28,182 --> 01:30:30,548
Because he has no strength.

1370
01:30:30,585 --> 01:30:32,610
I knew you were bluffing!
I knew he was bluffing.

1371
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:35,383
- Shall I dispatch him for you?
- Thank you, but no.

1372
01:30:35,423 --> 01:30:36,720
Whatever happens to us...

1373
01:30:36,757 --> 01:30:38,884
I want him to live a long life,
alone with his cowardice.

1374
01:30:40,828 --> 01:30:44,628
Inigo, where are you?

1375
01:30:44,665 --> 01:30:47,532
There you are.

1376
01:30:47,568 --> 01:30:50,162
Inigo,
I saw the prince's stables...

1377
01:30:50,204 --> 01:30:53,332
and there they were,
four white horses.

1378
01:30:53,374 --> 01:30:55,672
And I thought,
there are four of us...

1379
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:57,678
if we ever find the lady.

1380
01:30:57,712 --> 01:30:59,111
Hello, lady.

1381
01:31:00,615 --> 01:31:04,016
So I took them with me in case
we ever bumped into each other.

1382
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:06,485
I guess we just did.

1383
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:09,713
You did something right.

1384
01:31:09,757 --> 01:31:12,817
Don't worry.
I won't let it go to my head.

1385
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:33,146
You know...

1386
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:35,148
it's very strange.

1387
01:31:35,182 --> 01:31:38,674
I have been in the revenge
business so long...

1388
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,687
now that it's over...

1389
01:31:40,721 --> 01:31:43,713
I don't know what to do
with the rest of my life.

1390
01:31:44,725 --> 01:31:47,023
Have you ever considered piracy?

1391
01:31:47,061 --> 01:31:49,291
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.

1392
01:32:01,909 --> 01:32:03,501
They rode to freedom.

1393
01:32:03,544 --> 01:32:07,173
And as dawn arose, Westley and
Buttercup knew they were safe.

1394
01:32:07,214 --> 01:32:10,342
A wave of love swept over them.

1395
01:32:10,384 --> 01:32:13,114
And as they reached
for each other...

1396
01:32:15,222 --> 01:32:16,689
What? What?

1397
01:32:16,724 --> 01:32:19,921
It's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.

1398
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,487
I don't mind so much.

1399
01:32:28,202 --> 01:32:30,227
Since the invention
of the kiss...

1400
01:32:30,271 --> 01:32:31,932
there have been five kisses...

1401
01:32:31,972 --> 01:32:33,701
that were rated
the most passionate...

1402
01:32:33,741 --> 01:32:35,709
the most pure.

1403
01:32:35,743 --> 01:32:38,177
This one left them all behind.

1404
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,208
The end.

1405
01:32:47,221 --> 01:32:49,689
Now I think
you ought to go to sleep.

1406
01:33:02,169 --> 01:33:04,137
All right.

1407
01:33:07,141 --> 01:33:08,631
So long.

1408
01:33:10,211 --> 01:33:11,576
Grandpa...

1409
01:33:14,048 --> 01:33:16,539

01:33:16,584 --> 01:33:19,280
and read it again to me

1411
01:33:20,988 --> 01:33:23,286
As you wish.
