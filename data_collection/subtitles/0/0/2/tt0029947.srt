1
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,058
Good morning, Miss Swallow.

2
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:23,882
- Why, what's the matter?
- Dr. Huxley is thinking.

3
00:01:33,515 --> 00:01:36,489
Alice, I think this one
must belong in the tail.

4
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:39,460
Nonsense. You tried it in the tail yesterday
and it didn't fit.

5
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,410
Yes, that's right. I did, didn't I?

6
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,213
David, it's a telegram for you from Utah.
It's from the expedition.

7
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:49,040
The expedition! Open it. I'll be right down.

8
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:55,315
David, they found it! They found it, David!

9
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,817
Not the intercostal clavicle?

10
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,599
It's on its way. It'll be here tomorrow.

11
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,421
Just think of it, Professor.

12
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,521
The very last bone we needed
to complete the brontosaurus.

13
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:08,069
The intercostal clavicle is arriving
tomorrow after four years' hard work.

14
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,681
- Congratulations, my boy.
- Isn't it great? I can hardly believe it!

15
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:14,718
Stop it. Really, David, there's a time
and place for everything.

16
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,125
What will Prof. LaTouche think?

17
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,106
After all, you're getting married tomorrow.

18
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:21,559
- Yes, I know we are...
- Right, we're getting married tomorrow.

19
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,468
Isn't that odd? Two important things
happening on the same day.

20
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:26,546
I think the occasion calls for a celebration.

21
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,983
Don't worry, we'll celebrate.

22
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,061
We're going away
directly after we're married.

23
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:33,737
Going away? What are you thinking of,
David? After receiving this telegram?

24
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,583
As soon as we're married,
we're coming directly back here...

25
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,788
- and you're going on with your work.
- Alice.

26
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:42,528
Now, once and for all, David,
nothing must interfere with your work.

27
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:46,237
Our marriage must entail
no domestic entanglements of any kind.

28
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,825
- You mean...
- I mean of any kind, David.

29
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:52,650
Alice, I was sort of hoping...
You mean children, all that sort of thing?

30
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:57,222
Exactly. This will be our child.

31
00:02:57,776 --> 00:03:01,611
Yes, David, I see our marriage
purely as a dedication to your work.

32
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:04,584
Alice, everybody has to have
a honeymoon and...

33
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,045
We haven't time.

34
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:09,380
You have an appointment this afternoon.

35
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,204
- Have I? What for?
- To play golf with Mr. Peabody.

36
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:14,334
What Peabody?

37
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:17,083
The Alexander Peabody
who represents Mrs. Carleton Random.

38
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,105
Now let me think.

39
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:21,206
Who may donate $1 million
to the museum to complete all this.

40
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,603
Oh, sure! That Mr. Peabody.

41
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,065
$1 million.
That's pretty white of Mr. Peabody.

42
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,472
You haven't got it yet.

43
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:30,892
Let me remind you that a lot depends
on the impression you make on him.

44
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:34,631
Don't worry. After I've received this,
I feel good for anything.

45
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,518
I'll wow him, I'll knock him for a loop.

46
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:39,042
David, no slang.
Remember who and what you are.

47
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:41,281
- That's right.
- Go on. You mustn't keep him waiting.

48
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:44,382
- Goodbye, Alice. I mean, Professor.
- Don't forget your golf clubs.

49
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:47,322
Remember, let Mr. Peabody win.

50
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,016
Yes, Alice. I will.

51
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:52,841
Oh, dear. Excuse me.

52
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:54,642
I can't tell you, Mr. Peabody...

53
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:56,848
how much this endowment
would mean to the museum...

54
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:58,286
and to me personally.

55
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:00,525
If you could just give me
some assurance...

56
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,921
If you could give me some assurance
that you'd...

57
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:06,747
consider us first before you donate that
million to anyone else, I'd appreciate it.

58
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,314
Dr. Huxley, you seem to be
under some misapprehension.

59
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:11,072
I haven't got $1 million.

60
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:13,629
I represent the possible donor,
Mrs. Carleton Random...

61
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,516
whose legal advisor I happen to be.

62
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,648
Yes, of course. I forgot.

63
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:21,078
Mr. Peabody, then I wonder...

64
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:24,625
if you could use your influence
with Mrs. Random, that would be nice.

65
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,451
Dr. Huxley, when I play golf,
I only talk golf...

66
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:31,211
- and then only between shots.
- Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

67
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:35,036
Couldn't we continue this discussion
over a whisky and soda after our game?

68
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:36,997
Yes, we could.

69
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:40,821
Meantime, I believe you hooked your ball.

70
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,732
Yes, I did.
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody.

71
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:48,558
Yes. All right.

72
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:52,521
Look! You can't...

73
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:56,016
That's my ball. Just a minute!

74
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,710
Here's hoping.

75
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,587
I say, just a minute. I beg your pardon.

76
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:01,706
Oh, dear.

77
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:04,679
- You shouldn't do that, you know.
- What shouldn't I do?

78
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,925
Talk while someone's shooting.

79
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:08,290
Anyway, I forgive you
because I got a good shot.

80
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,496
- You don't understand.
- It's right next to the pin.

81
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:11,966
That has nothing to do with it.

82
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:14,173
- You playing through?
- I've just teed off.

83
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:16,474
You must be a stranger here.
You should be over there.

84
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:20,299
This is the 18th fairway and I'm on
the green. If I sink this, I'll beat my record.

85
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,825
Be there in a minute!
What kind of ball are you playing?

86
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,871
- PGA.
- I'm playing a CrowFlight.

87
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,630
I like a PGA better.

88
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,675
I'm trying to prove
that you're playing my ball.

89
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:33,159
A PGA has two black dots,
and a CrowFlight has a circle.

90
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,142
I'm not superstitious.

91
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:38,966
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Stop talking and take out the pin.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,826
Oh, my, this is so silly.

93
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:45,113
See? It's a circle.

94
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:47,704
Of course. Do you think
it would roll if it were square?

95
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:51,530
I have reference to a mark on the ball.
That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.

96
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:53,586
What does it matter?
It's only a game, anyway.

97
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,439
Young lady, you don't seem to realize...

98
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,997
you've placed me
in a very embarrassing position.

99
00:05:57,997 --> 00:05:59,020
Really? I'm sorry.

100
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,504
The most important lawyer in New York
is waiting for me on the first fairway.

101
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:05,350
Then it's silly of you
to be fooling around on the 18th green.

102
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,618
You don't mind if I take this with me?

103
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,674
Not at all.

104
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:12,500
Tell the caddy master to put it in my bag
when you're finished.

105
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:16,696
Huxley, come on!

106
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:20,522
Yes, I'll be with you in a minute,
Mr. Peabody!

107
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:31,231
Hey, mister, I think that's your car.

108
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,245
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!

109
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,780
What do you think you're doing?

110
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,315
I'm trying to un-park my car.

111
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:53,361
- Oh, hello.
- This is my car!

112
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,598
Good. Would you mind
moving it out of the way?

113
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,507
- No. This is my car.
- Yes, I understand that.

114
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:00,905
If you move it back four feet,
I'll be able to get out.

115
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:04,708
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Maybe this is yours. What did you say?

116
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,193
I said if you move it back about four feet,
I'll be able to get out.

117
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,366
I'm in a terrible hurry, and I can't budge.

118
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:13,148
- You want me to move your car?
- Would you mind terribly?

119
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:15,385
- Yes, I will, but...
- That would be awfully kind.

120
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:19,211
- Take it very easy.
- Yes, I'll go slowly.

121
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,577
What are you doing?

122
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:24,592
I have to get into position.

123
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:25,805
Please be careful.

124
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:27,852
I will. Now, you say when.

125
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:29,609
- Yes, all right.
- Am I clear?

126
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:33,435
Yes, you're clear now.

127
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:38,241
- Now look what you've done.
- That's all right. I'm insured.

128
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,533
I don't care whether you're insured or not!

129
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,875
Let me drive this car.

130
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,752
It's all right. It's an old wreck, anyway.
It doesn't matter.

131
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:48,821
You don't understand. This is my car!

132
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:51,283
- You mean this is your car?
- Of course.

133
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:53,073
Your golf ball, your car?

134
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,598
Is there anything in the world
that doesn't belong to you?

135
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:57,100
Yes, thank heaven. You!

136
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,986
Now, don't lose your temper.

137
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:02,811
Young lady, I'm not losing my temper.
I'm merely trying to play some golf.

138
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:05,858
You choose the funniest places.
This is a parking lot.

139
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,169
Will you get out of my car?

140
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,855
- Get off my running board.
- This is my running board!

141
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,380
All right, honey, stay there.

142
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,562
Help me!

143
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:15,609
Don't think everything
in the world is yours.

144
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:19,411
This is my car, I'll handle it.

145
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,929
If you want to come with me, go ahead.

146
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:26,754
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!

147
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,230
Good evening, sir.

148
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,876
I'm looking for Mr. Alexander Peabody.
I believe he's dining here.

149
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,538
Mr. Peabody has not arrived yet.

150
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,869
Is that so? Well, I'll just wait.

151
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,757
- Yes, sir.
- Good evening, Louis.

152
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,761
- Good evening, Mr. Brown. Right this way.
- Thank you.

153
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,616
May I check your hat, sir?

154
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,373
- Excuse me?
- Check your hat?

155
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:58,761
No, I better... Maybe you'd...

156
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,192
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:05,016
Look at that. I dropped my hat.
I'd better hang on to it.

158
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:08,384
- Now, watch very carefully.
- I'm watching.

159
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:12,208
I take an olive, I throw it in that glass,
but there it is.

160
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:15,896
- Now I throw it in that one.
- Wait. Now, without the... Go on.

161
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:18,164
Watch.

162
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:21,488
I know what happens. That's wonderful.
You take three, don't you?

163
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:23,536
Only you cheated.
You can see me take three.

164
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:26,188
You throw it in the glass.
Take another one, throw it.

165
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:30,013
- Good!
- And then you do this.

166
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:34,818
I'm so sorry. Oh, hello.

167
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,673
You're sitting on your hat.

168
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:39,070
- I know it.
- That's silly. Get up. I'm awfully sorry.

169
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,987
I couldn't be more apologetic, really.

170
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:43,449
Well, I might have known you were here.

171
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,623
I had a feeling just as I hit the floor.

172
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:48,339
That was your hat.

173
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,099
Look at it. Look.

174
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:52,048
Yes, it's too bad, isn't it?

175
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:55,021
Joe here was showing me a trick,
and the olive got away.

176
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:58,378
First you drop an olive,
then I sit on my hat. It all fits perfectly.

177
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:01,094
You can't do that trick
without dropping some of the olives.

178
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:02,085
It takes practice.

179
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:03,683
What, to sit on my hat?

180
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:06,496
No, to drop an olive.

181
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:09,533
Now, if you're going to be angry with me,
what can I do?

182
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:10,747
Go away.

183
00:10:10,747 --> 00:10:12,794
No. I was here first.

184
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:16,619
- Then I'll go away.
- What, you...

185
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:38,014
Won't you just take the olive dish?

186
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:40,507
No, it's all right.
I'll sit here. You don't mind, do you?

187
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,393
- Not at all.
- This is rather difficult.

188
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,928
- I guess it is.
- Goodness.

189
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,677
Your face is familiar.
Haven't we met somewhere?

190
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:47,700
Not to my knowledge.

191
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,777
You're wrong. My name's Susan Vance.

192
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:51,535
I'm Dr. Fritz Lehman.

193
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,997
That's all right. You can sit down.
I don't mind at all.

194
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:57,130
- You may have heard me lecture.
- What do you lecture about?

195
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,956
I usually talk about nervous disorders.
I am a psychiatrist.

196
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,469
Oh, crazy people.

197
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:04,195
We dislike the use of that word.

198
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:07,965
All people who behave strangely
are not insane.

199
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:10,874
Is that so?

200
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:14,007
Would you mind if I asked your
professional opinion about something?

201
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,446
Not at all.

202
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:18,003
What would you say about a man
who follows a girl around...

203
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:20,561
and then when she talks to him,
he fights with her?

204
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:23,149
Fights with her?
Is the young man your fianc?

205
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,930
No. I don't know,
I never even saw him before today.

206
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,903
No, he just follows me around
and fights with me.

207
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:32,729
The love impulse in man very frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict.

208
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,233
The love impulse?

209
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,534
Without my knowing anything about it...

210
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:40,698
my rough guess would be
that he has a fixation on you. A fixation...

211
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:43,831
Wait a minute, I can't remember
more than that. A fixation?

212
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:47,657
"The love impulse in man frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict."

213
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,279
- That's right.
- I'm eternally grateful to you.

214
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,348
You're absolutely wonderful.
Thank you very much.

215
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,841
Do you know why you're following me?
You're a fixation.

216
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,846
I'm not following you.
I haven't moved from this spot.

217
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:01,125
Please, you're following me.

218
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,553
Don't be absurd.
Who's always behind whom?

219
00:12:03,553 --> 00:12:06,399
My dear young lady,
I haven't been behind anything...

220
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,212
but what they call the eight ball.
I haven't been all day.

221
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,418
- You're angry, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

222
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:14,807
The love impulse in man frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict.

223
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:16,916
- Excuse me. The what impulse?
- Love impulse.

224
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,801
The trouble with you is that you have a...

225
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,336
Look, all I'm trying to do...

226
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:22,606
is find the gentleman whom,
thanks to you...

227
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:25,707
I abandoned on the golf course today.
That's all. Now please go...

228
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:27,816
Say, this isn't...
Where do you suppose I...

229
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:31,642
- Hold this a minute. I'll be right back.
- Yes.

230
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:36,159
Missed.

231
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,237
- I'm sorry I was so long.
- It's quite all right.

232
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:41,944
I had a very entertaining conversation
with a young lady who does tricks...

233
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:44,310
with olives when she gets it right.

234
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,068
Fritz, where's my purse?

235
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:47,730
I thought you had it with you.

236
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,935
No, I left it right here on the table.

237
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,761
- My diamond pin was in it.
- Your diamond pin?

238
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,850
You just lost a diamond pin.
We're going to find it, all right?

239
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,960
- Don't worry about it.
- Excuse me.

240
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,772
Why, there it is. Thank you very much.
It's very kind of you.

241
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:09,019
- Thank you.
- Why, no.

242
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:10,840
This is my purse. My diamond pin is in it.

243
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,792
- Will you please...
- No, I'm afraid...

244
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,837
- Give me that.
- Will you please hand it over?

245
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,193
- Do something about it.
- Keep out of it, darling.

246
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:22,020
- I did the trick.
- You did? Good.

247
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:26,089
It is madness for you
to say it's not my wife's.

248
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:28,071
You've made a slight blunder.
This belongs...

249
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,308
There is the young lady.
Isn't this your purse?

250
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:33,089
- No, this is my purse.
- There you are. Hand it over.

251
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:35,583
Just a minute.
Didn't you give me this purse to hold?

252
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,043
Yes, that's right, I did.
I gave him the purse to hold.

253
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:40,409
There's been a mistake. I lost my purse.

254
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,582
I must've picked up your wife's purse
by mistake.

255
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:45,076
I wanted him to stay here,
so I gave him this purse...

256
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,025
while I went to find mine.
I was coming back.

257
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:50,030
- Now, that's all perfectly clear, isn't it?
- No, it isn't.

258
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,748
- She's going to give me an explanation.
- No!

259
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,944
My dear sir, it never will be clear
as long as she's explaining it.

260
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,734
- Now please let me go.
- Just a minute.

261
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:58,885
He's innocent.

262
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,762
Now you have your wife's purse,
I have my purse...

263
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:05,279
and Louie will explain it all to you
and everything will be all right.

264
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,491
Please listen.
You can't think I did that intentionally.

265
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:11,176
If I could think,
I'd have run when I saw you.

266
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:15,002
If you'd only let me explain.
I just gave you my purse to...

267
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:20,340
You've torn your coat.

268
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:23,739
Now, I didn't do it on purpose.
That's not right. It's not my fault.

269
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,563
I did it, but I didn't mean to do it.
I just caught hold of your coat.

270
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:29,780
Will you do something for me?

271
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,835
A needle?

272
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:34,096
No, it's simpler than that.
Let's play a game.

273
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:35,661
What?

274
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:39,486
Watch. I'll put my hand over my eyes,
and then you go away. See?

275
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:42,087
Then I'll count to 10,
and when I take my hand down...

276
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,195
you will be gone. One...

277
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:47,265
I like that. I was only trying to be nice.

278
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,727
Thank you.

279
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:50,749
Just a minute!

280
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,986
You can't talk to me that way
then crawl out of it.

281
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:55,896
- When I'm mad, I'm mad.
- Something horrible has happened.

282
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,645
Don't tell me about it.
Just get out of it as best you can.

283
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:02,417
Please stop following me around,
fixation or no fixation. I've had enough.

284
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,326
- Stop talking, so I can tell you...
- Will you stop crowding me?

285
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:08,363
- I'm just trying to tell you, you've torn...
- No, I didn't.

286
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:11,175
- If you'd waited for my explanation...
- Not my coat...

287
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:15,000
...your coat would still be very all right.

288
00:15:15,586 --> 00:15:18,943
- What is the matter with you?
- You see, I...

289
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,500
Do you realize you're making
a fool out of yourself?

290
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,048
You can't tell me I tore your coat.
There's such a thing as being fair.

291
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:27,253
Will you please stop doing that
with your hat?

292
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,267
Just stand there, will you?

293
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:30,994
What in the world is going on?

294
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:33,198
- No! Please don't move!
- I've had enough of this.

295
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,044
Listen to me. Let's get out of here.
Just start walking.

296
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:37,514
So now you want to walk.

297
00:15:37,514 --> 00:15:39,976
Well, I'm quite sure
that I don't want to walk with you.

298
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:43,237
I hope you realize that you've made
a perfect spectacle of yourself.

299
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,484
Have you finished?

300
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:48,308
- Yes.
- Thank you.

301
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,360
Don't just stand there. Do something.

302
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,854
Oh, my goodness. Get behind me.

303
00:15:56,854 --> 00:15:58,037
- I am behind you.
- Get closer.

304
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:01,861
I can't get any closer. Are you ready?
Be calm. Left foot first.

305
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,767
- Go straight out the door.
- I have to meet someone here. There he is.

306
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,109
Don't you dare leave me.

307
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:14,936
I'll be with you in a minute, sir.

308
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,767
It's very important that I meet this man
to explain to him what happened...

309
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:25,495
although if I saw him,
I wouldn't know what to say.

310
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:26,647
It's perfectly simple.

311
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:29,619
Tell him you met someone you knew
and were detained.

312
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:33,444
I can picture myself explaining our exit
from the Ritz Plaza to Mr. Peabody.

313
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:36,172
It's not Boopie that you're trying to see?

314
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:37,546
No. His name's Peabody.

315
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:40,327
Alexander Peabody.
But that's Boopie, and I know him well.

316
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:43,843
I was going to have supper
with him tonight. He'll do anything I ask.

317
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:47,551
- Let's go to the Ritz and catch him.
- I'd better go there alone.

318
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:51,376
If we miss him there,
we'll go out to Riverdale. There you are.

319
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:55,341
- I couldn't spend that much time.
- Riverdale's only half an hour away.

320
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:59,058
Yes, but I have to go to Carnegie Hall
to meet Miss Swallow.

321
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:02,883
- Miss Swallow?
- Yes. I'm engaged to Miss Swallow.

322
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,163
Engaged to be married?

323
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:07,306
- That's right.
- That's nice.

324
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:10,535
- Then she won't mind waiting, will she?
- I wouldn't like to...

325
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:12,931
If I were engaged to you,
I wouldn't mind waiting at all.

326
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,757
- I'd wait for ever.
- But it wouldn't be right.

327
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,740
- I finally got you here, didn't I?
- Yes.

328
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:31,141
Susan, do they build all the houses
in Riverdale alike?

329
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,782
I don't think so. Why?

330
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:36,607
Because if they don't, we've passed
this one six times in the last hour.

331
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:40,454
But it was such a lovely night
for a drive. Come on.

332
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:42,659
Oh, dear.

333
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:45,473
There aren't any lights.
Mr. Peabody must have gone to bed.

334
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:48,413
No, he couldn't have gone
to bed this soon. It's early.

335
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:51,705
If they expected you, they could,
with the covers over their heads.

336
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:55,094
If you don't stop nagging, I won't help you
arrange matters with Boopie.

337
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:57,203
I've a feeling it might be better
if you didn't.

338
00:17:57,203 --> 00:17:59,729
- Why?
- I don't think we ought to do this, Susan.

339
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:01,902
If we wake him up, he'll be irritable.

340
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:05,728
I don't think it's gonna work,
but I know where Boopie sleeps.

341
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,552
You can't climb
in a man's bedroom window.

342
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:12,376
I know. It's on the second floor.

343
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:15,168
Please, it's too late now.
You can't wake him up.

344
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:17,535
Can't I?

345
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:18,588
What are you doing?

346
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:20,539
- Pebbles.
- What for?

347
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,703
If you throw pebbles against a window,
people think it's hail...

348
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:27,528
and then they come and close the window.

349
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:33,612
I know we ought to go now,
but somehow I can't move.

350
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,946
I guess they weren't big enough.

351
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:39,079
Why not...

352
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,773
What?

353
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:44,599
- Here's a pip.
- Just a minute!

354
00:18:45,951 --> 00:18:49,776
Jeepers! Let's get out of here.

355
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:55,573
Don't worry,
everything's going to be all right.

356
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:58,929
Tomorrow, when Boopie's calmed down,
we'll go and see him together.

357
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,412
Now, just a moment. Don't think
that I don't appreciate all you've done...

358
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:03,756
It was nothing, David...

359
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:06,792
Just a moment. But there are limits
to what a man can bear.

360
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:10,619
Besides, tomorrow afternoon
I'm going to get married.

361
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,240
What for?

362
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,066
Because... Anyway, I'm going
to get married, and don't interrupt.

363
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:23,052
Now, my future wife has always
regarded me as a man of some dignity.

364
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:28,945
Privately, I'm convinced
that I have some dignity.

365
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:30,958
Now, it isn't that I don't like you, Susan...

366
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,731
because after all, in moments of quiet,
I'm strangely drawn towards you...

367
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:36,872
but there haven't been
any quiet moments.

368
00:19:36,872 --> 00:19:39,812
Our relationship has been
a series of misadventures...

369
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,411
from beginning to end.

370
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:45,237
So if you don't mind,
I'll see Mr. Peabody alone and unarmed.

371
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,782
Without me?

372
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:49,339
Yes, without you,
and definitely without you.

373
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:51,609
Now, Susan, I'm going to say goodnight.

374
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:55,434
And I hope that I never set eyes
on you again. Goodnight.

375
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:13,313
Yes, I did see Mr. Peabody,
but I didn't see him.

376
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:17,139
That is, I didn't see him really.

377
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,897
Yes, I spoke to him twice,
but I didn't talk to him.

378
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:23,723
But I don't understand.
Did you see him or didn't you?

379
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:27,377
No, I don't know.

380
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:30,638
How do I know? Because...

381
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:33,067
There's someone at the door.

382
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:36,264
You see, there are some things
that are very hard to explain, Alice...

383
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:39,141
and as soon as I...

384
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:41,571
Yes, Alice.

385
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,959
Now, Alice,
before we're married this afternoon...

386
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:46,877
there's one thing we must have clear.

387
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:50,713
I don't want any woman interfering
with my affairs. It's fatal.

388
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:52,183
That's the stuff, buddy.

389
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:53,942
- What do you want?
- Dr. Huxley?

390
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,093
Sign here.

391
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:58,917
Just a minute, Alice.
I have to sign something.

392
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:01,996
Alice, it's arrived!

393
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:04,777
The intercostal clavicle.
Yes, isn't that wonderful?

394
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:07,463
Isn't that a marvelous wedding present?
Thank you.

395
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,603
You see, I'm going to be married
this afternoon.

396
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,682
Don't let it throw you, buddy.

397
00:21:11,682 --> 00:21:15,326
Yes, Alice. Yes, isn't it great?

398
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:17,083
Alice, I'm so excited.

399
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,865
I'll tell you what you do.
You go on down to the museum...

400
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:23,690
and I'll meet you there right away.
Goodbye.

401
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:35,240
Hello. Oh, it's you.

402
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,021
I can't hear very well.
Come closer to the telephone.

403
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,994
I said, "Good morning, David."
Do you want a leopard?

404
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:43,232
Why should I want a leopard?

405
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:45,629
For that matter, why should I?
But I've got one.

406
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:48,698
- Where would you get a leopard?
- I wouldn't get a leopard.

407
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:52,087
My brother Mark got him.
He's hunting in Brazil and he caught him.

408
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:54,356
Of course. It's a stuffed leopard.

409
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:58,181
Of course. Why should my brother
be hunting stuffed leopards in Brazil...

410
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:02,912
when he can find them right here
in New York?

411
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:09,305
David, it's lucky I met you yesterday,
because you're the only zoologist I know.

412
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,430
Of course I know what a zoologist is.

413
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,764
Get out of here. No, not you, David.

414
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:20,590
Baby, get back into that bathroom.
You're making a nuisance of yourself.

415
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:25,032
No, not you, David.
No, I want you to come right over.

416
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:27,951
David, don't be irrelevant.
The point is, I have a leopard.

417
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:30,029
The question is,
what am I going to do with it?

418
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,257
Susan, I regret to say
the leopard is your problem.

419
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:36,135
You mean you refuse to help me?
David, you can't do that.

420
00:22:36,135 --> 00:22:39,960
You can't leave me alone with a leopard.
I'll come and get you in my...

421
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:44,127
Susan! What happened?

422
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,148
Is it the leopard?

423
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:48,441
No. Nothing happened to me, David,
I just...

424
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:50,871
I mean, the leopard!

425
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,523
David, the leopard!

426
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:57,348
Can you hear me, Susan?

427
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:05,703
Susan, be brave! I'll be right there!

428
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:09,506
Hold on there, Susan!
Susan! Can you hear me?

429
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:13,333
I'll be there, Susan!

430
00:23:33,448 --> 00:23:36,485
- You're all right.
- Yes, I'm all right.

431
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:38,562
- You lied to me!
- No. Just a little.

432
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:40,705
Telling me a ridiculous story
about a leopard.

433
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:42,782
- I have a leopard. Right in there.
- Where is it?

434
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:45,021
- I don't believe you.
- But you have to believe me.

435
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,866
I've been the victim
of your unbridled imagination once more.

436
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:51,690
Chasing all the way...

437
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:55,089
That'll teach you to go around
saying things about people.

438
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:57,008
You've got to get out of this apartment.

439
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:58,478
But I can't. I have a lease.

440
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,395
You've got to get that thing out of here.

441
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,793
Don't worry, he's all right.
What are you gonna do?

442
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:03,975
- Call the zoo.
- You can't!

443
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,716
That's the meanest thing I ever heard.
He's a pet, he'd be miserable in a zoo.

444
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,059
Listen. From my brother Mark:

445
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,392
"Dear Susan, I'm sending you Baby."
That's Baby.

446
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:13,085
"Guard him with your life.

447
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,898
"He's three years old, gentle,
and he likes dogs."

448
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:19,671
I don't know whether that means he eats
dogs or is fond of them. Mark's so vague.

449
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:23,059
<i>"He also likes that song, I Can't Give You
Anything but Love, Baby. "</i>

450
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:26,096
- That's absurd!
- No, it isn't, really. Listen.

451
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:28,845
This is probably the silliest thing
that ever happened to me.

452
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:31,593
It's silly but true.
He absolutely adores the tune.

453
00:24:31,593 --> 00:24:33,000
What's the difference?

454
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,825
It's silly that he likes such an old tune.
I imagine that down in Brazil...

455
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:39,968
- Stop this, Susan.
- Let me show him to you.

456
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:43,793
Don't go near the door! Dear, dear.

457
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:48,311
Watch, David.
He'll go right toward the music.

458
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:51,029
Look at that. Isn't this remarkable?

459
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,372
It loves it, David.

460
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:55,727
If we put the Victrola in the bathroom,
will it go back in?

461
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,553
Yes, but the music sounds better out here.
Besides, he likes it.

462
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:01,290
Here it comes.

463
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,115
Now go away! Please go away!

464
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:08,163
I'm gonna get out of here.

465
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:09,568
Susan, I don't like leopards.

466
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:12,445
- Just think of him as a house cat.
- I don't like cats either.

467
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:15,354
- Stand still. Don't be nervous.
- Make him stand still!

468
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:18,582
Don't be silly.
You can't make a leopard stand still.

469
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:21,172
Do something. Turn off that Victrola.

470
00:25:21,172 --> 00:25:24,369
I don't think it's the music. I think it's you.

471
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:28,194
I think you've found a real friend.
Isn't it affectionate, like a baby kitten?

472
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:32,072
I never saw anything take such a liking
to anyone. It'd follow you anywhere.

473
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,150
We'll have no trouble
taking it to Connecticut.

474
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,973
My farm in Westlake, Connecticut.

475
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:38,177
I'm not going to Westlake, Connecticut.

476
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:40,895
I will not be involved
in any more harebrained schemes.

477
00:25:40,895 --> 00:25:43,963
Imagine Aunt Elizabeth coming here
and running smack into a leopard.

478
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:45,849
That would be an end to my $1 million.

479
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:49,686
If you had an aunt who was going to give
you $1 million and she found a leopard...

480
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:52,115
- in your apartment, what would you do?
- I don't know.

481
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:53,233
You have to help me.

482
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:57,060
There are only two things I have to do,
finish my brontosaurus and get married.

483
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,139
Go on, quitter.

484
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:03,963
It's no good calling me names,
because I won't argue with you anymore.

485
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,864
I don't want anything to do with a leopard.

486
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,585
Go on, Baby, down the stairs.

487
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:32,636
Good morning.

488
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:45,210
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.

489
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,215
You'd better change your mind
about coming to Connecticut.

490
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:51,347
Susan, we settled that question
once and for all.

491
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:54,063
But what about my leopard?

492
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:55,630
That's your problem.

493
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,452
It's not all my problem.

494
00:26:57,452 --> 00:26:59,465
Susan, will you please go away?

495
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:03,291
All right. Since he likes you so much,
I've decided to give him to you.

496
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:05,188
I won't take him.

497
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:09,013
You've got him.

498
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:14,906
Don't go away! I've got the leopard!

499
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:16,183
Oh, dear, look at that.

500
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:19,060
No, David,
all I was doing was driving along.

501
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,418
You were standing on the sidewalk yelling,
and looking very silly.

502
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:25,678
You know very well
you tricked me into this trip.

503
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:29,097
Look. Eating your car.

504
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:31,943
Look at the road!

505
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:34,469
I have a feeling
something horrible is going to happen.

506
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:36,994
Everything's going to be all right.

507
00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:40,819
I don't care anymore.

508
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,314
Hello. What's the matter,
did you get Ionely?

509
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,966
Susan, if you know any shortcuts,
please take them.

510
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,885
We'll be there in no time.

511
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:52,369
I just want to deliver this leopard,
take the first train back to town...

512
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:54,415
and forget
the last 24 hours ever happened.

513
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:58,218
Now, what's wrong with the last 24 hours?
I've had a wonderful time.

514
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,576
Susan, I don't know.
You look at everything upside down.

515
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:03,493
I've never known anyone quite like you.

516
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:05,379
You've just had a bad day, that's all.

517
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,585
That's a masterpiece of understatement.

518
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,622
Look, I can't discuss anything with you...

519
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:14,042
with Baby breathing
down the back of my neck.

520
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:17,868
Get down. Go on. Now lie down.

521
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:22,662
Susan, duck!

522
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:37,601
Never hang on to a leopard's tail!

523
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:41,425
Sing, David!

524
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:52,721
Anyway, I still insist that he was
right in the middle of the road.

525
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,340
I've never hit anything
that was in the right place.

526
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,355
That wagon was on the side of the road.

527
00:28:57,355 --> 00:28:59,591
It was straight ahead of me.
That's why I hit it.

528
00:28:59,591 --> 00:29:02,501
- What time is it?
- We'll be there in no time.

529
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:06,327
We just have to stop at Westlake
and get some meat for Baby.

530
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,789
Why, he's already had an assortment
of ducks and chickens.

531
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,548
Not to mention a couple of swans.

532
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:12,921
All feathers.

533
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:14,583
Yeah, very expensive feathers.

534
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,877
I don't see how any pair of swans
could cost $150. That was a gyp.

535
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:21,553
If you'd run, as I told you to,
we shouldn't have had to pay for them.

536
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:24,685
Susan, when a man is wrestling a leopard
in the middle of a pond...

537
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:28,510
he's in no position to run.

538
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:39,092
There it is, David. Please hurry up.

539
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,791
Why, of all places,
when you have a leopard in the car...

540
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:46,805
did you stop in a town
where there's a circus?

541
00:29:46,805 --> 00:29:50,545
I didn't stop because there's a circus,
but Baby's going to be hungry.

542
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:53,358
Please hurry.
If Baby wakes up, we'll be in trouble.

543
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:57,184
I don't suppose it will make any difference,
but you're parked in front of a fireplug.

544
00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:01,211
I know it. Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything. You go ahead.

545
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:08,285
50, $1.00. Thank you.

546
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:09,596
Yes. What can I do for you?

547
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:12,377
I want 30 pounds of sirloin steak, please.

548
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,103
Did you say 30 pounds?

549
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,300
- Yes, that's right, 30 pounds.
- How will you have it cut?

550
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,017
- Just in one piece.
- You going to roast it or broil it?

551
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:23,843
- It's going to be eaten raw.
- Yeah.

552
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:36,310
Hey, lady. That's a fireplug.

553
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:37,599
I know it.

554
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,424
- It's against the law to park alongside one.
- I know it.

555
00:30:42,043 --> 00:30:45,079
- Come here.
- Who, me? Why?

556
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,755
I am Constable Slocum.

557
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:50,512
Is that so?

558
00:30:50,512 --> 00:30:53,389
- How do you do? I'm Susan Vance.
- How do you do?

559
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:57,216
I don't care who you are, I just want you
to know you can't park beside a fireplug.

560
00:30:57,449 --> 00:31:00,454
- I was just watching the parade.
- You were?

561
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:02,339
I suppose you get free seats to the circus.

562
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:05,376
Elmer and I usually get a...
That has nothing to do with it.

563
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:07,102
I'm just going to give you a ticket.

564
00:31:07,102 --> 00:31:09,692
Thank you very much.
I'd love to go to the circus...

565
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:12,409
but you better keep your tickets
because I'm busy tonight.

566
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:16,234
Yeah? Well, it ain't that kind of a ticket.

567
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,323
Jeepers.

568
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,392
Young lady, it might interest you
to know that you're under arrest.

569
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:23,373
Oh, well. I mean, why?

570
00:31:23,373 --> 00:31:25,804
For parking alongside of a fireplug.

571
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:28,391
I'm not parked next to a fireplug.

572
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:30,949
Yeah? What do you call that?

573
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:34,049
You mean that you think
that this is my car?

574
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,073
Ain't it?

575
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:37,022
No. That's my car.

576
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,421
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

577
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:43,245
You didn't ask me.

578
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:47,987
Say, do you grind this up
before you eat it?

579
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:50,448
This isn't for me. It's for Baby.

580
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:54,273
For who?

581
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:56,266
Hurry up, Baby. Get in!

582
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:57,672
- But...
- Jump on!

583
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:59,079
That isn't your car!

584
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,275
No, but it's my leopard!

585
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:05,248
- Wait a minute! That's my car!
- What are you yelling about?

586
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:08,636
They stole my car. Last night,
she tried to steal my wife's purse.

587
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,353
Don't stand there.
Do something! Catch them!

588
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:13,847
Well, Elmer, bless me. Bring back that car!

589
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>- I'm glad we finally got here
- Isn't it wonderful?</i>

590
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,158
<i>We could put him in that box
Wait, don't open the door</i>

591
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:25,738
<i>- until you close those
- I think that is a good idea, too</i>

592
00:32:25,738 --> 00:32:28,902
<i>I hope he won't get out</i>

593
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:31,267
<i>Stand by that door, and I'll open this one</i>

594
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:33,985
<i>He'll just walk along, I hope</i>

595
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,510
<i>Come on, Baby. Go on</i>

596
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,971
<i>In the stall, Baby</i>

597
00:32:38,971 --> 00:32:41,976
<i>Come on, baby,
right in there, right in there</i>

598
00:32:41,976 --> 00:32:43,894
<i>Right in there</i>

599
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:46,962
<i>Now everything is quite all right</i>

600
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:49,392
<i>No, everything is not all</i>

601
00:32:49,392 --> 00:32:53,217
Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe
for you, but I've got to get to New York.

602
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:57,384
Now one thing's settled,
you start worrying about something else.

603
00:32:57,384 --> 00:33:01,059
One of us should worry!
On top of all this, we've stolen a car!

604
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:03,840
That's all right.
I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.

605
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,100
I suppose you'd like me to leave it
with the constable on my way back.

606
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,722
No, you might be arrested.
Besides, it's a hot car.

607
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:11,959
You're going to file
the numbers off the engine.

608
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:15,284
No, I'll have the gardener take it back
after it's dark.

609
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,043
- Stop it!
- You're shedding.

610
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:18,545
Now, where's the telephone?

611
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,685
- Out that door.
- That's all I want to know.

612
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:22,252
What I want to suggest is...

613
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:25,801
I don't want any more suggestions
from you. My fiance is waiting for me.

614
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:28,101
In order to get married,
I have to get to New York.

615
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:30,820
I want you to be married,
I think you should be married.

616
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,560
I think every man should be.
But I don't think any girl will marry you...

617
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,510
- Iooking the way you do.
- Where's the phone?

618
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,323
- In there, but look at yourself.
- What's the matter with me?

619
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:40,472
I am dirty, aren't I?

620
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:42,615
You see? What I want to suggest is...

621
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:45,140
The only way I'll follow
another of your suggestions...

622
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,144
is if you hold a bright object
in front of my eyes and twirl it.

623
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:50,254
I understand. I simply wanted to suggest...

624
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:52,972
I don't want any suggestions.
I just want to clean up.

625
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:54,251
Where is there a shower?

626
00:33:54,251 --> 00:33:58,075
That's what I was going to suggest,
a shower.

627
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:21,069
- Hannah.
- Yes, Miss Susan?

628
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:23,690
Send these into town
and have them cleaned and pressed.

629
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,663
- Why? I can do them here.
- Don't argue with me, Hannah.

630
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:28,516
Into town.
Have them cleaned and pressed.

631
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:30,594
It'll take a lot longer.

632
00:34:30,594 --> 00:34:34,420
There's no hurry, no hurry at all.

633
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:44,808
- Hurry up, David.
- I am hurrying.

634
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:48,368
- David.
- What?

635
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:51,149
- What's in the box?
- What did you say?

636
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:54,921
That's the intercostal clavicle
of a brontosaurus.

637
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,263
Really?

638
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:58,181
It's just an old bone.

639
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,196
Yes, it's just an old bone.

640
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:02,113
Put it down gently and go away.

641
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:05,468
All right.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

642
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:07,515
Hand me my clothes, will you?

643
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:09,465
They aren't here. They're being pressed.

644
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:12,406
- What?
- The gardener's taken them into town.

645
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:15,283
For what? Stop him. I can't wait.
I must leave immediately.

646
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:16,690
You can't leave without clothes.

647
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,438
I know that. Where are you going?

648
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:21,356
I'm going to take a shower.

649
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:23,401
Susan! Don't leave me here like this!

650
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,224
Don't be impatient, David.

651
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:28,773
We'll talk it over after I've finished.
Everything's going to be all right.

652
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:30,818
"Everything's going to be all right."

653
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:32,863
Certainly, everything's going
to be all right.

654
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:36,572
Everything's going to be...
I'm losing my mind, that's all.

655
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:39,257
Roaming around Connecticut
without any clothes on.

656
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:42,453
I don't believe it. How can all these things
happen to just one person?

657
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:46,161
Susan, where are you?

658
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:49,838
Will you come out and help me find some
clothes or must I come in and get you?

659
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:50,987
You wouldn't.

660
00:35:50,987 --> 00:35:53,002
Yes, I would!

661
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:55,079
Maybe I wouldn't.

662
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,637
- Susan, where's the gardener's room?
- Why?

663
00:35:57,637 --> 00:36:01,057
- Because he must have some clothes.
- What? I can't hear you.

664
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:04,094
- You can hear what you want to hear!
- What did you say?

665
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:07,771
I just said... Never mind.
I'll find the place myself.

666
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,975
The gardener must have clothes.
Clothes are clothes.

667
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:11,222
The gardener's in town.

668
00:36:11,222 --> 00:36:13,491
He couldn't have taken all his clothes
with him!

669
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:14,514
Yes, he could.

670
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:17,136
Of all the conceited,
spoiled little scatterbrains.

671
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:20,364
My goodness, the man who gets...

672
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:23,210
The man who gets you
is gonna have a lifetime of misery!

673
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,574
"Everything's going to be all right."

674
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,013
What do you want?

675
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:28,964
Who are you?

676
00:36:28,964 --> 00:36:30,881
- Who are you?
- What do you want?

677
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:32,479
Who are you?

678
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,877
I don't know. I'm not quite myself today.

679
00:36:34,877 --> 00:36:37,273
You look perfectly idiotic in those clothes.

680
00:36:37,273 --> 00:36:39,095
These aren't my clothes.

681
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:41,461
Where are your clothes?

682
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:42,836
I've lost my clothes.

683
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:45,201
But why are you wearing these clothes?

684
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:49,027
Because I just went gay all of a sudden!
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

685
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:53,054
Now, young man. Stop this nonsense.
What are you doing?

686
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:57,689
I'm sitting in the middle of 42nd Street
waiting for a bus.

687
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:05,691
Go away!

688
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:07,865
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.

689
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:11,690
- Stop it, George! What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

690
00:37:12,372 --> 00:37:16,198
Susan, come back here. Stop it, George!

691
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,065
Aunt Elizabeth, it's you!
I've never been so thrilled in my life.

692
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:24,135
This is amazing to see you here,
and George dear.

693
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:27,396
- What made you come out here?
- Quiet, George!

694
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:31,221
Now, stop gushing
and tell me, who is this man?

695
00:37:32,574 --> 00:37:34,620
- Where'd you get him?
- He's a friend of Mark's.

696
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,411
- What's he doing here?
- Susan brought me.

697
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:37,945
I don't doubt it, but why?

698
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:38,967
I got a letter from Mark.

699
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:42,793
He said David was an old friend of his.
He'd been working very hard in town...

700
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,063
and was on the point
of having a nervous breakdown.

701
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,087
I'm a nut from Brazil.

702
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:49,580
He's very excitable.
We let him do whatever he wants.

703
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,072
- Where are his clothes?
- Susan took them.

704
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:55,238
- What's he doing in that thing?
- Mark said he should be allowed...

705
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:58,434
to wear a negligee. No telling what'll
happen if he's not allowed to.

706
00:37:58,434 --> 00:38:00,000
Does he want to wear those clothes?

707
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,826
No, I don't want to wear this thing.
I just want to get married!

708
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:07,694
Susan, I forbid it!
I absolutely put my foot down. The idea!

709
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:21,354
- Quiet!
- Please listen to me!

710
00:38:21,354 --> 00:38:25,178
- Quiet!
- Don't talk so much.

711
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,230
Perhaps you could help me.

712
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,714
Perhaps you could help me
find some clothes.

713
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:36,184
Why, yes.

714
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:40,021
There must be some of Mark's things
around somewhere.

715
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:42,291
- Aren't there some...
- Are there?

716
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:44,816
Well...

717
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:47,948
Yes. There are some
in Mr. Mark's room, sir.

718
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:51,401
- Yes, sir.
- Which is Mr. Mark's room?

719
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:53,798
It's the end, sir. Yes, sir.

720
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:57,624
Thank you.

721
00:38:58,913 --> 00:39:02,738
Go away.

722
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:12,082
He loves me. He loves me not.

723
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:14,096
David! Where'd he go?

724
00:39:14,096 --> 00:39:15,440
He went to get some clothes.

725
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,265
If he gets clothes, he'll go away.
He's the only man I've ever loved.

726
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:21,929
David! What will I do without David?

727
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:25,753
Stop. Get away from me.

728
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:33,042
George, please be quiet.

729
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:50,889
- David?
- What?

730
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,382
- Can I come in?
- I don't care what you do!

731
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:57,207
- Thanks. Where are you?
- Here I am. What do you want?

732
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:58,273
Go on and laugh.

733
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,767
I know it looks ridiculous,
but I'm past caring.

734
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,300
What are you going to do?

735
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,826
What I've been trying to do,
get back to New York!

736
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:06,808
You can't go dressed that way.

737
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:09,749
They're all I could find,
and clothes are clothes. I'm going.

738
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:10,963
I'm going back to New York...

739
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:14,479
if only to repair the damage
that's been done since I've known you.

740
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,835
The damage to Miss Swallow,
the museum, Mr. Peabody and everybody...

741
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:20,074
Mr. Peabody? But, David...

742
00:40:20,074 --> 00:40:23,015
the one way to get to Mr. Peabody
is through Aunt Elizabeth.

743
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:26,147
Please listen for one second.
He'll do anything she tells him to.

744
00:40:26,147 --> 00:40:28,896
He'll even like you.
He's Aunt Elizabeth's lawyer.

745
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:32,220
He's her lawyer. Mr. Peabody.

746
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,489
- What's your aunt's name?
- Elizabeth.

747
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:36,280
- But she has another name.
- Of course.

748
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,655
Never mind. Don't tell me.

749
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:40,435
Why not? It's Random.
Mrs. Carleton Random.

750
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:43,439
- Yes, I know. I knew that was coming.
- What's the matter?

751
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:47,266
Out of seven million people,
why did I have to run into you yesterday?

752
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:50,058
What have I done?

753
00:40:50,058 --> 00:40:53,828
Susan, Mrs. Random is going
to give away $1 million.

754
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:55,172
I know.

755
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:58,998
I wanted it for the museum.

756
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:04,048
I'm afraid you've made a rather
unfavorable impression on Aunt Elizabeth.

757
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:07,927
I quite realize that.

758
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:09,813
- Susan, listen to me.
- What?

759
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:13,455
A lot of things have happened but
we'll forget them because this is serious.

760
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:15,021
What, David?

761
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:18,847
Can you concentrate for just a moment?
There's only one thing to be done.

762
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,437
And this is important to me
and to my work.

763
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:23,461
What?

764
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:27,232
You're so good-Iooking
without your glasses.

765
00:41:27,232 --> 00:41:30,013
- Listen to me. Try and remember.
- What?

766
00:41:30,013 --> 00:41:32,603
I've made a horrible mess of things.

767
00:41:32,603 --> 00:41:36,429
Your aunt must never find out who I am.
You do understand, don't you?

768
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,229
Yes, David.

769
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,650
You can tell her that I'm Mark's friend
and I have bats in the belfry...

770
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,814
but don't ever tell her my name.
Can you remember that?

771
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:46,636
- Yes, David.
- You're sure?

772
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:50,462
Yes, David. But you are good-Iooking
without your glasses.

773
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:52,517
Never mind, Susan.

774
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:54,531
What did I say?

775
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:58,271
What did I do? What did I say?

776
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,637
- What did I do?
- I just asked you to remember...

777
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:03,034
- I swear I'll remember...
- Where is it?

778
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:05,592
- I know exactly what you told me to say.
- Where is it?

779
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:06,583
Where's what?

780
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,692
- My intercostal clavicle.
- Your what?

781
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,761
My bone. It's rare. It's precious.
What did you do with it?

782
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:13,104
Your bone?

783
00:42:13,104 --> 00:42:15,469
- You had it. Give it to me.
- I haven't got it.

784
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:19,080
- Did you carry it somewhere?
- Why would I carry a bone around?

785
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,053
I wouldn't dare give a reason
for anything you do.

786
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:24,770
I guess you'll have to find another one.

787
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,647
It took three expeditions
and five years to find that one!

788
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:31,483
Now that they know where to find one,
couldn't you send them back for another?

789
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:34,008
Susan, you had it.
You took it out of the box.

790
00:42:34,008 --> 00:42:36,854
- Where did you put it?
- I put it back in the box.

791
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:40,679
- Was there somebody else in the room?
- There was nobody else, but...

792
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:42,832
- George.
- Who's George?

793
00:42:42,832 --> 00:42:46,657
The dog. Don't you see? Dog, bone.

794
00:42:48,745 --> 00:42:52,570
- George!
- George!

795
00:42:52,997 --> 00:42:54,691
Stop it! You sound like an echo.

796
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:58,515
- George!
- Nice George.

797
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:01,148
Did you see him?

798
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:02,299
- See who?
- George.

799
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:04,248
Are those the only clothes you could find?

800
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,125
Come back here this minute.
What are you doing?

801
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,244
- Hunting for George.
- Why?

802
00:43:08,244 --> 00:43:10,801
David wants him.
David thinks he's such a nice dog.

803
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:12,335
George? He's a fiend, and you know it.

804
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:16,161
- But David doesn't.
- Come here!

805
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,343
He's definitely not in the house.
That's settled.

806
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:28,477
Don't do that. He knows you want him.
He'll hide.

807
00:43:28,477 --> 00:43:30,363
Susan, where's he apt to go?

808
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:33,912
- George is apt to go anywhere.
- No. Where does he hide things?

809
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:36,535
- How can I tell?
- You ought to know.

810
00:43:36,535 --> 00:43:39,763
There he is! George!

811
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:42,735
My goodness, look at his nose.
He's been digging. He's buried it.

812
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:44,844
There are 26 acres in this garden.

813
00:43:44,844 --> 00:43:48,295
That's awful.
George, where did you hide that bone?

814
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:52,101
No, David, not that way.
Now, George, we're not angry.

815
00:43:52,101 --> 00:43:54,049
David and Susan need that bone.

816
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,799
It's a nasty old bone,
it's hundreds of years old.

817
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,357
That's David's bone.

818
00:43:59,357 --> 00:44:03,064
Susan will get you a nice, fresh bone
if you'll show us where it is.

819
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:06,357
- Look at the nasty little cur!
- You'll ruin everything. Spell it.

820
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:09,393
George, don't be stubborn.
Susan loves you.

821
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:12,590
Where'd you put it? Don't you remember?
Where'd you dig?

822
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:16,415
He's not paying attention... George!

823
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,887
It's easy if you know how to handle him.

824
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:22,149
Everything's going to be all right.
This must be the spot.

825
00:44:22,149 --> 00:44:25,974
He's going to start digging in a minute.
That's right, George.

826
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,320
- It's very simple if you keep your head.
- I do hope he doesn't hurt that bone.

827
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:33,208
Isn't he a strong little man, David?

828
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:35,702
He's got something! Come on, dig.

829
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:37,938
- Dig.
- I'm digging.

830
00:44:37,938 --> 00:44:39,857
I feel something!

831
00:44:39,857 --> 00:44:42,222
I hope it isn't hurt.

832
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:44,268
Look, David, a boot.

833
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,697
- A boot.
- Don't hit George, David.

834
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:48,168
I wasn't going to hit George.

835
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:51,045
George, that was fine,
but you've got to concentrate again.

836
00:44:51,045 --> 00:44:54,870
David has to find his bone.
No. Not in there.

837
00:44:55,552 --> 00:44:59,228
- Isn't this fun? Just like a game.
- Yes.

838
00:44:59,228 --> 00:45:02,296
George, if you get tired of digging
you just tell David and Susan...

839
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:06,122
where you hid it, and they'll dig.

840
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:09,872
Susan, do you think
George is really trying?

841
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:13,069
Almost every place he's taken us,
we've found something.

842
00:45:13,069 --> 00:45:15,786
- There's nothing here.
- Look, David, another boot.

843
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:18,247
Another boot. That makes three pairs.

844
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:20,294
Come on, George, quit stalling.
Where is it?

845
00:45:20,294 --> 00:45:22,274
Don't be discouraged.

846
00:45:22,274 --> 00:45:24,673
George, concentrate. Bones, not boots.

847
00:45:24,673 --> 00:45:26,526
- There he goes.
- See? He's got the idea.

848
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:30,351
- I'm getting tired of all this digging.
- Yes, what we need is a plow.

849
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:34,038
- Susan?
- Jeepers, it's Aunt Elizabeth.

850
00:45:34,038 --> 00:45:37,681
Follow him, David, don't let him get away!

851
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:39,440
Yes, Aunty, I'm coming.

852
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,265
Susan, what on earth are you doing?
What are all these?

853
00:45:43,468 --> 00:45:45,098
Those? They're holes.

854
00:45:45,098 --> 00:45:48,070
I can see they're holes.
How did they get here?

855
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,947
David and George and I were digging.

856
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:53,666
- Who is this David?
- He's a friend of Mark's.

857
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:56,670
- Is that all you know about him?
- I know I'm going to marry him.

858
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,981
He doesn't know it, but I am.

859
00:45:57,981 --> 00:46:00,858
If you're planning to marry him
on my money, you're mistaken.

860
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,543
I don't want another lunatic in my family,
I've got enough.

861
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:05,684
When are you going to marry him?
What's his name?

862
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:08,210
It's Bone.

863
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,776
- Bones?
- One Bone.

864
00:46:09,776 --> 00:46:13,600
One bone or two, it's a ridiculous name.
What does he do?

865
00:46:14,315 --> 00:46:15,305
He hunts.

866
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,352
Hunts? Hunts what?

867
00:46:17,352 --> 00:46:19,269
Well, animals, I should think.

868
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:21,763
- Big-game hunting?
- Yes. Very big.

869
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:25,534
You call that big-game hunting?

870
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:26,909
Look at that.

871
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,635
Aunty, he's just playing with George.

872
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:30,585
He won't play with George
another minute.

873
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:34,411
Tell him dinner's at 8:30 sharp.
George, come here this minute!

874
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:39,844
Come along, George.

875
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:46,504
Yes, Alice, I am in Connecticut,
but I can't get in...

876
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:50,330
because I've been unavoidably detained.

877
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:53,728
David, listen.

878
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,423
I can't hear you. I'm talking.

879
00:46:55,423 --> 00:46:59,248
Go away. I'll be with you
as soon as I'm finished.

880
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:06,003
Now, David, you have to listen to me.

881
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:08,912
Yes, I know that...

882
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:11,053
Susan, will you please get off the phone?

883
00:47:11,053 --> 00:47:14,879
David, it's about the leopard.
He's making the most terrific rumpus.

884
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:19,109
- He's hungry. We've got to feed him.
- I can't help that.

885
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:21,314
What, Alice, dear?
No, it's somebody on the line.

886
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:23,968
- Keep quiet, Susan.
- You've got to help. This can't wait.

887
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:25,885
If the people in this house hear him...

888
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,867
they'll think something terrible
has happened.

889
00:47:27,867 --> 00:47:31,255
Susan, get off the line, please...
Hello, Alice.

890
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:35,081
What? I don't know what time it is!

891
00:47:37,392 --> 00:47:41,219
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 7:37 and one quarter.

892
00:47:42,156 --> 00:47:43,658
Susan, please!

893
00:47:43,658 --> 00:47:45,384
Alice, I can't hear you.

894
00:47:45,384 --> 00:47:49,210
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 7:40.

895
00:47:50,755 --> 00:47:54,580
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 7:40 and one half.

896
00:47:56,476 --> 00:47:59,642
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 7:41.

897
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:01,750
Pardon me. The time is 8:10.

898
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,733
When you hear the tone, the time will be...

899
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:07,557
No. My watch shows 8:10 and a quarter.

900
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,624
Who are you?

901
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:12,448
Who am I? I'm 8:10...
I'm Major Horace Applegate.

902
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:15,298
- What do you want?
- Mrs. Random invited me for dinner.

903
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:18,015
Would you please find out
if she still wants me?

904
00:48:18,015 --> 00:48:19,517
She's hung up.

905
00:48:19,517 --> 00:48:21,275
So am I.

906
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:25,099
Why, Horace, what are you doing?
Are you coming in or going out?

907
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,604
He's coming in to dinner.

908
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:30,864
- How do you do? I'm Susan Vance.
- How do you do, Miss Susan?

909
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:33,741
- Hello, Elizabeth.
- You're much too big to swing on gates.

910
00:48:33,741 --> 00:48:37,097
- I found that out.
- Susan, where are you going?

911
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:38,152
I'm just going out.

912
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:41,349
You should be watching George,
not playing with telephones...

913
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:42,372
Excuse me.

914
00:48:42,372 --> 00:48:44,194
George is fast asleep in my room.

915
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:47,326
Now come here, young man,
and don't be afraid.

916
00:48:47,326 --> 00:48:50,491
- You look much better in those clothes.
- Thank you.

917
00:48:50,491 --> 00:48:54,317
- I want you to meet Mr. Bone.
- How do you do, Mr. Bone?

918
00:48:55,093 --> 00:48:58,291
No. You're Mr. Bone.
This is Major Applegate.

919
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:01,040
Yes, I'm Major Applegate.
At least, I'm pretty sure I am.

920
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,661
That is, I was this morning.

921
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:05,387
There must be some mistake.

922
00:49:05,387 --> 00:49:09,213
No mistake. I've known Major Applegate
for 20 years. Haven't I, Horace?

923
00:49:09,798 --> 00:49:13,570
Twenty-two, to be exact, I think, Elizabeth.
It was long about...

924
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:17,055
- How do you do, Mr. Applegate?
- How do you do again. Thank you.

925
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:20,731
- Now, Mr. Bone, we'll go for a walk.
- I'd like to explain...

926
00:49:20,731 --> 00:49:24,183
- You don't need to.
- That's all right. I understand.

927
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:28,008
Goodbye, Major Applegate... Mr. Bone.

928
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:32,238
Strange young man, isn't he?
Is he suffering from something?

929
00:49:32,238 --> 00:49:33,773
He's had a nervous breakdown.

930
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:35,915
- Had or has?
- Had.

931
00:49:35,915 --> 00:49:38,025
It's left him sort of... You know.

932
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:40,741
My, my, what a pity. And so young, too.

933
00:49:40,741 --> 00:49:43,586
The trouble is, Susan seems
to be showing the same tendencies.

934
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:45,312
Is that so? You're all right, though?

935
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:48,765
- I hope so. Have a drink.
- Thank you.

936
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:51,897
Conversation at dinner
may be a trifle difficult...

937
00:49:51,897 --> 00:49:55,509
on account of this young man,
so I want you to draw him out.

938
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:57,747
I don't know what you mean.

939
00:49:57,747 --> 00:50:01,007
Talk about something he understands.
Big-game hunting, for instance.

940
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:04,587
- He's a hunter like yourself.
- You don't say.

941
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:07,464
Then, Elizabeth,
you've come to the right man.

942
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:11,268
There. He's fed.
Now I'm sure he's going to be quiet.

943
00:50:11,268 --> 00:50:15,094
Come on, let's go in to dinner.
Why are you just sitting there?

944
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:19,888
I'm just trying to figure out
how I ever got mixed up in all this.

945
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:21,913
"Mr. Bone." Isn't that amazing?

946
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:25,557
You told me not to tell Aunt Elizabeth
what your real name was.

947
00:50:25,557 --> 00:50:29,381
I didn't tell you
to think up a name like Bone.

948
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:37,374
Stay there, George.
Come on, quickly! Get out of here!

949
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:40,325
- Shut the door.
- What's the matter?

950
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:43,777
Did you ever think what would happen
if Baby and George got together?

951
00:50:43,777 --> 00:50:46,239
- They'd probably like each other.
- And if they didn't?

952
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:49,723
- Baby would eat George.
- That's what I mean.

953
00:50:49,723 --> 00:50:53,547
There it was, straight before me,
crouching as tigers do before the kill.

954
00:50:54,326 --> 00:50:55,861
But I was ready for him.

955
00:50:55,861 --> 00:50:59,685
I drew a bead, leveled away
and caught him right between the eyes.

956
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,957
My, it certainly was
a thrilling experience...

957
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:06,185
as I'm sure you'll all agree...

958
00:51:06,185 --> 00:51:10,010
or do you, Mr. Bone?

959
00:51:12,514 --> 00:51:15,806
Have you ever been...
Pardon me. So sorry.

960
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,938
Have you ever been in Arabia, Mr. Bone?

961
00:51:18,938 --> 00:51:22,296
I said, "Have you ever been in Arabia?"

962
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:23,350
No.

963
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:27,176
I suppose you've spent
most of your time in Africa?

964
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:29,264
- Tibet, perhaps?
- No.

965
00:51:29,264 --> 00:51:33,089
- Malay Peninsula, perchance?
- Excuse me.

966
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,670
At least that got a rise out of him.

967
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,676
You see, you shouldn't have mentioned
the Malay Peninsula.

968
00:51:40,676 --> 00:51:44,160
He was horribly clawed there by a tiger.
He doesn't like talking about it.

969
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,229
I had a gun bearer once
who was clawed by a tiger.

970
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:51,054
He... The poor...

971
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:55,668
I was just telling Major Applegate
that you were clawed by a tiger...

972
00:51:55,668 --> 00:51:57,682
in the Malay Peninsula.

973
00:51:57,682 --> 00:52:00,750
I've never been there.

974
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,575
You've never... Well, no matter.

975
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:08,581
What type of gun do you use
in hunting tigers, Mr. Bone?

976
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:12,407
I personally use a bolt-action Mauser
with a very large bore.

977
00:52:13,248 --> 00:52:16,062
Excuse me.

978
00:52:16,062 --> 00:52:19,578
Susan, imagine giving a dinner party
with your husband stalking...

979
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:23,403
like Hamlet's ghost all through the meal.

980
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:30,413
Give me patience.

981
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:34,239
No, this is too much. I can't stand it.

982
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:38,395
We were talking about the jungle
while you were away, Mr. Bone.

983
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:42,624
- My soup is gone.
- It was cold.

984
00:52:42,624 --> 00:52:46,450
Digging trenches.
Blaming it on an innocent dog.

985
00:52:47,387 --> 00:52:49,817
Nothing but a heap of nonsense.

986
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:53,332
Enough to drive a man crazy.

987
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:56,369
And then they say,
"Keep away from the bottle. Don't drink."

988
00:52:56,369 --> 00:53:00,196
No, not even a wee drop
to steady a man's nerves.

989
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:03,243
If one more thing happens, I'll quit.

990
00:53:03,243 --> 00:53:07,067
And where Aloysius Gogarty goes,
Mrs. Aloysius Gogarty goes, too.

991
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:12,023
A doctor chasing after a dog!

992
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,284
Just picture it.

993
00:53:16,284 --> 00:53:19,064
A vast, mysterious silence
vibrant with life...

994
00:53:19,064 --> 00:53:22,550
strange cries in the night.

995
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:26,034
- Good gracious, what was that?
- That was a loon, Elizabeth.

996
00:53:26,034 --> 00:53:28,047
L-O-O-N, yes.

997
00:53:28,047 --> 00:53:31,873
Once you've got the jungle in your blood,
I wouldn't be able to keep you out of it.

998
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:36,966
- Susan, did you hear that?
- I didn't hear a thing.

999
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:40,321
- You didn't?
- Are you quite sure that was a loon?

1000
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:42,496
Yes, indeed. I've heard many a loon.

1001
00:53:42,496 --> 00:53:45,182
And if there ever was a loon,
that is a loon.

1002
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:49,006
- Isn't it, Mr. Bone?
- No.

1003
00:53:49,335 --> 00:53:51,958
- Well, what do you say it was?
- A leopard.

1004
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,236
Don't be ridiculous.

1005
00:53:53,236 --> 00:53:55,890
Major Applegate would know a leopard cry
if he heard it.

1006
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,926
Thank you, Elizabeth.
I'm an authority on animal cries.

1007
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:01,196
Now, you take the rogue elephant,
for instance.

1008
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,168
Excuse me, Major. You're right.
It is a loon.

1009
00:54:04,168 --> 00:54:05,671
Thank you.

1010
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:09,443
The leopard's cry is something that,
once heard, you can never forget.

1011
00:54:09,443 --> 00:54:12,096
Yes, I know.

1012
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:13,470
You know. Thank you.

1013
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:16,827
Of course, it varies at different seasons.

1014
00:54:16,827 --> 00:54:19,513
- Let me see now, what month is this?
- June.

1015
00:54:19,513 --> 00:54:23,338
June? It would go something like this.

1016
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:26,512
I'll just prepare for it.

1017
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:29,102
Now, let me see.

1018
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:32,928
There we have it.

1019
00:54:37,445 --> 00:54:39,938
- Pardon me.
- It's still a loon.

1020
00:54:39,938 --> 00:54:42,942
Of course, I haven't practiced
the leopard cry in a long time.

1021
00:54:42,942 --> 00:54:44,350
I'm slightly out of voice.

1022
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:48,175
- Try again.
- Yes, I shall.

1023
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:57,104
Now, I didn't do that.

1024
00:54:57,104 --> 00:54:59,501
It was probably an echo.

1025
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:02,058
It was a long time coming back, wasn't it?

1026
00:55:02,058 --> 00:55:05,883
- Try again.
- I shall.

1027
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:13,407
There. That's better.

1028
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,557
That's peculiar.

1029
00:55:14,557 --> 00:55:16,986
There aren't any leopards
in Connecticut, are there?

1030
00:55:16,986 --> 00:55:18,201
- Yes.
- No.

1031
00:55:18,201 --> 00:55:21,845
- Why do you say yes?
- You see... Pardon me.

1032
00:55:21,845 --> 00:55:22,867
Excuse me.

1033
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:25,840
Susan! Finish your dinner
and stop this nonsense.

1034
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,590
All right, but you'll be sorry.

1035
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,414
I can't stand it.
I've got to get away from it.

1036
00:55:32,777 --> 00:55:35,717
Instead of sitting decently at the table
eating their dinners...

1037
00:55:35,717 --> 00:55:39,543
they're howling and roaring at one another
like a lot of banshees.

1038
00:55:40,192 --> 00:55:44,018
And then they say,
"Gogarty, you mustn't drink.

1039
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,886
"Gogarty, you must keep away
from the bottle."

1040
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,783
The bottle.

1041
00:55:49,783 --> 00:55:52,243
As if a man didn't need something
to listen to them.

1042
00:55:52,243 --> 00:55:54,002
I'm within my rights.

1043
00:55:54,002 --> 00:55:57,827
I'm perfectly within my...

1044
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:03,933
If one more thing happens to upset me,
I'll be seeing things.

1045
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,992
Hannah.

1046
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:22,696
Hannah Gogarty!

1047
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:26,192
Me gun!

1048
00:56:26,192 --> 00:56:29,516
- Now what's happened?
- This is no time for personalities.

1049
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:32,360
What would you be wanting of a gun now?

1050
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,246
Hand me my gun.

1051
00:56:34,246 --> 00:56:36,133
Be quiet, both of you!

1052
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:38,051
Gogarty, what is all this?

1053
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:40,608
- I saw it outside.
- Saw what?

1054
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:43,997
A cat as big as a cow,
with eyes like balls of fire.

1055
00:56:43,997 --> 00:56:46,522
Clean up this mess.
And serve the next course.

1056
00:56:46,522 --> 00:56:49,174
Do you realize what's happened?
Baby's escaped!

1057
00:56:49,174 --> 00:56:50,740
- I don't care.
- We've got to catch him.

1058
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,170
- I've got to watch George.
- You're not staying here.

1059
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,303
If you stay here, I'll tell Aunty
that your name is Dr. David Huxley.

1060
00:56:56,303 --> 00:57:00,128
- Right now.
- Don't! All right, I'll go with you.

1061
00:57:00,554 --> 00:57:04,379
Major Applegate, keep an eye on George!
Thank you.

1062
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,683
Baby! The door's open.

1063
00:57:07,683 --> 00:57:08,897
- Is he there?
- I don't know.

1064
00:57:08,897 --> 00:57:12,413
Nope, he's gone. Oh, dear.
Now Aunt Elizabeth...

1065
00:57:12,413 --> 00:57:13,724
Don't lose your head.

1066
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:15,290
- My what?
- Your head.

1067
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:19,062
- I've got my head. I've lost my leopard.
- Now, wait a minute.

1068
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,939
Nothing's gained by uncontrolled hysteria.

1069
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,952
- Compose yourself.
- What should we do?

1070
00:57:23,952 --> 00:57:27,777
I'll call the zoo, say we saw a leopard,
and they'll catch him. Come on.

1071
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:34,278
Susan, I hope this time
you've come to stay.

1072
00:57:34,278 --> 00:57:36,579
Yes, I've come to stay, Aunty.

1073
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:39,456
We've just been walking up and down.

1074
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,150
Where's that young man going now?

1075
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:43,099
He's just going in to take a rest.

1076
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:46,297
He has to take frequent rests.
The doctor says...

1077
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:48,822
Have you ever had jungle fever, Major?

1078
00:57:48,822 --> 00:57:52,465
You have. Then you realize
how important rest is.

1079
00:57:52,465 --> 00:57:54,863
Poor Mr. Bone.
In his case, it's rather difficult...

1080
00:57:54,863 --> 00:57:58,156
because he has two doctors.
One says rest, one says exercise.

1081
00:57:58,156 --> 00:57:59,242
Which do you prefer?

1082
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,662
- I think that perhaps...
- Why, Susan, listen to this.

1083
00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:05,156
- What?
- This is a cable from Mark.

1084
00:58:05,156 --> 00:58:07,105
- Mark?
- Not a particle of sense in it.

1085
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:08,353
What does it say?

1086
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:12,126
"Are you pleased with Baby? Love, Mark."

1087
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:15,950
- Mark?
- And not a word about my leopard.

1088
00:58:16,856 --> 00:58:18,295
Your leopard?

1089
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:20,404
- I've always wanted a leopard.
- Excuse me.

1090
00:58:20,404 --> 00:58:23,217
You know, he promised...

1091
00:58:23,217 --> 00:58:24,528
Thank you very much.

1092
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:26,860
Don't call the zoo.

1093
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:29,865
- I just called. It's all fixed.
- Call back and unfix it.

1094
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:32,870
- No questions, call back.
- I told them they could have the leopard.

1095
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:35,204
You've given away Baby?
You have no right!

1096
00:58:35,204 --> 00:58:38,751
- It's your fault. You've ruined everything!
- I've had enough. I quit.

1097
00:58:38,751 --> 00:58:40,542
You can't quit. Call them back.

1098
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:42,748
- But you said...
- Everything's changed.

1099
00:58:42,748 --> 00:58:46,008
- That leopard belongs to Aunt Elizabeth.
- Aunt Elizabeth?

1100
00:58:46,008 --> 00:58:48,342
Just call back and say you were mistaken.

1101
00:58:48,342 --> 00:58:51,251
I've just managed to convince them
that I did see a leopard.

1102
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:54,767
- They'll never believe me.
- I'll fix that. I'll say you're a drug addict.

1103
00:58:54,767 --> 00:58:58,592
- You're always seeing things.
- Never mind. Give me that phone.

1104
00:58:59,657 --> 00:59:01,096
- Hello, operator?
- Not so loud.

1105
00:59:01,096 --> 00:59:02,630
Get me Westlake-284.

1106
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,380
- I don't know...
- Never mind, David.

1107
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:09,205
Hello. Is that zoo?
Nobody's talking baby talk.

1108
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,027
I'm the man that called up
about the leopard.

1109
00:59:12,027 --> 00:59:15,384
You don't have to do anything.
It's all been a mistake.

1110
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:17,430
- Stop them!
- What's the matter?

1111
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:20,595
- What did he say?
- It's too late. It was the night watchman.

1112
00:59:20,595 --> 00:59:23,120
- He said everybody's out leopard hunting.
- Jeepers!

1113
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,945
You've gotten us into a wonderful mess.
Let's think before we act.

1114
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:30,846
- You think. You think faster than me.
- What do you take to catch a leopard?

1115
00:59:31,176 --> 00:59:34,180
- How big a leopard?
- We've got to catch him before they do.

1116
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,005
- I've got to watch George.
- We'll take George with us.

1117
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,702
Aunty, we're taking George for a walk.

1118
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,810
- Where's the leash?
- My goodness!

1119
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,153
- Where's George?
- Where's George?

1120
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:46,711
- Why this morbid interest?
- I've got to find him.

1121
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:47,734
What for?

1122
00:59:47,734 --> 00:59:49,588
He knows where my intercostal clavicle is.

1123
00:59:49,588 --> 00:59:50,802
Your what?

1124
00:59:50,802 --> 00:59:53,232
Major Appletree,
you promised to watch George.

1125
00:59:53,232 --> 00:59:54,670
- I did.
- But you didn't.

1126
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:55,694
Where is he?

1127
00:59:55,694 --> 00:59:57,067
- He's gone.
- Gone where?

1128
00:59:57,067 --> 00:59:58,953
- Out that door.
- Why didn't you say so?

1129
00:59:58,953 --> 01:00:00,903
No, not that door. That door.

1130
01:00:00,903 --> 01:00:03,365
- Thank you.
- That's right.

1131
01:00:03,365 --> 01:00:06,242
I can't stand this another moment.

1132
01:00:06,242 --> 01:00:08,735
Come along. Let's get some fresh air.

1133
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:11,611
- Yes. Shall we run?
- Yes.

1134
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:15,437
I can't understand why a loon
would answer a leopard's cry.

1135
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,324
There's something wrong.

1136
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:21,905
- They both sound exactly alike to me.
- No, pardon me, Elizabeth.

1137
01:00:21,905 --> 01:00:24,782
Please, the leopard's cry is
entirely different.

1138
01:00:24,782 --> 01:00:28,608
As I explained to you in there,
the leopard's cry goes like this.

1139
01:00:33,572 --> 01:00:36,001
What a terrible noise.
I don't see how you do it.

1140
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:38,622
It's done largely with the palate.

1141
01:00:38,622 --> 01:00:42,459
The hands play an important part
in the resonance and carrying power.

1142
01:00:42,459 --> 01:00:46,038
- Why do you put your thumbs together?
- You see, the thumbs...

1143
01:00:46,038 --> 01:00:49,864
it's very necessary that the base
of the thumbs are close together like that.

1144
01:00:50,003 --> 01:00:53,838
That brings out a sort of pear-shaped tone,
you see?

1145
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:57,664
Having done this, you take a deep breath,
keep the throat well open...

1146
01:00:58,153 --> 01:01:01,979
and out comes...

1147
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,268
My. That's fine, Elizabeth...

1148
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:12,186
for one who hasn't had any practice.

1149
01:01:12,186 --> 01:01:14,424
Really, it is. You've got something there.

1150
01:01:14,424 --> 01:01:17,014
- Got what?
- The mating cry.

1151
01:01:17,014 --> 01:01:20,018
- Now, don't be rude, Horace.
- I'm not rude.

1152
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:22,767
I was merely alluding to the scream
you did just now.

1153
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:24,749
- I didn't scream.
- You didn't scream?

1154
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:26,890
- I certainly did not.
- You didn't scream?

1155
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,033
No. I ought to know if I screamed.

1156
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:31,269
Then there must be
something wrong here.

1157
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:34,593
I should say so.
I've never known anything like it.

1158
01:01:34,593 --> 01:01:37,759
Ever since I came into the house
there's been something wrong.

1159
01:01:37,759 --> 01:01:39,101
- Elizabeth...
- It's been bedlam!

1160
01:01:39,101 --> 01:01:42,554
- Don't you think it's time we went inside?
- No. We've only just left it.

1161
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:44,982
But don't you think
it's a good idea to go back?

1162
01:01:44,982 --> 01:01:47,605
No, I think it's a good idea
to continue our walk.

1163
01:01:47,605 --> 01:01:51,430
But don't you find it a bit chilly
without a gun?

1164
01:01:58,888 --> 01:02:01,253
- Why don't you sing, David?
- I can't.

1165
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:04,322
- You can. You have a fine strong voice.
- But not for singing.

1166
01:02:04,322 --> 01:02:07,391
It's not fair. You're just being stubborn.

1167
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:11,003
- That's a dog.
- George.

1168
01:02:11,003 --> 01:02:14,828
- What's the matter?
- Something moved in that bush.

1169
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:18,951
Let me go first.

1170
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:37,214
Don't you think it would be better
if I went first?

1171
01:02:37,214 --> 01:02:40,123
No. You might get hurt.

1172
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:43,512
Thank you, David.

1173
01:02:43,512 --> 01:02:46,004
- I can't see a thing.
- Neither can I.

1174
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:49,830
Are you sure you saw something moving
in here, because I can't...

1175
01:02:50,352 --> 01:02:52,558
Susan, where are you?

1176
01:02:52,558 --> 01:02:56,383
- Here I am.
- This is no time to be playing squat tag.

1177
01:02:57,896 --> 01:03:01,093
I'm not playing.

1178
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:04,919
I'm caught on something.
Help me, will you?

1179
01:03:05,057 --> 01:03:08,030
- Help me, will you?
- No. That's poison ivy.

1180
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,426
I bet you wouldn't treat Miss Swallow
this way.

1181
01:03:10,426 --> 01:03:12,920
I'll bet she knows poison ivy
when she sees it.

1182
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,957
Yes, I bet poison ivy runs when it sees her.

1183
01:03:15,957 --> 01:03:19,783
I'm not here to discuss Miss Swallow.
I'm looking for George. I'll find him if...

1184
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:28,125
David, are you all right?

1185
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,228
- Don't laugh.
- I can't help it.

1186
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:36,052
You look so silly.

1187
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,786
Did you hear that? That's Baby.

1188
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:06,611
- It's George, too.
- You don't suppose...

1189
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:10,542
Shut up.

1190
01:04:10,905 --> 01:04:14,730
Look!

1191
01:04:20,111 --> 01:04:22,700
Look, David, they like each other.

1192
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,527
But goodness knows
how long that's going to last.

1193
01:04:31,971 --> 01:04:35,796
In another minute, my intercostal clavicle
will be gone forever.

1194
01:04:40,122 --> 01:04:41,976
Here, George. Come here.

1195
01:04:41,976 --> 01:04:45,801
No. Susan, be quiet.

1196
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:53,835
Is there any way to cross this stream?

1197
01:04:53,835 --> 01:04:57,661
- Surely it's shallow. We can wade across.
- Good.

1198
01:05:03,009 --> 01:05:06,834
The riverbed's changed.

1199
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,969
Did we get across?

1200
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:14,793
No, we're right back where we started,
only we're wet.

1201
01:05:16,114 --> 01:05:18,704
Now George and Baby have disappeared.

1202
01:05:18,704 --> 01:05:22,475
While you were at it, you might
as well have gone to the other side.

1203
01:05:22,475 --> 01:05:25,033
While I'm wet I'm gonna go
to the other side!

1204
01:05:25,033 --> 01:05:28,860
Don't leave me!

1205
01:05:33,216 --> 01:05:37,041
If we'd had a bathhouse,
this wouldn't have been so complicated.

1206
01:05:37,499 --> 01:05:39,129
Next time I'll try and arrange one.

1207
01:05:39,129 --> 01:05:42,955
Or perhaps there are portable bathhouses
for people like you. There must be.

1208
01:05:44,276 --> 01:05:46,322
Don't be so grouchy.

1209
01:05:46,322 --> 01:05:49,872
We could have such fun. There's moonlight
and everything is so lovely.

1210
01:05:49,872 --> 01:05:52,236
- And I do so like being with you.
- You do?

1211
01:05:52,236 --> 01:05:53,834
Well, I like peace and quiet.

1212
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:57,158
But it's peaceful and quiet here.

1213
01:05:57,158 --> 01:06:00,675
Let's just stay here and let George
and Baby look for us.

1214
01:06:00,675 --> 01:06:03,040
Your sock's on fire.

1215
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,866
That's all right. I don't care anymore.

1216
01:06:07,738 --> 01:06:11,564
- That's fine. Throw the other one in.
- That's true. You could have...

1217
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:13,333
Don't be upset, David.

1218
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:14,931
Well, who wouldn't be?

1219
01:06:14,931 --> 01:06:17,266
Here I am, trying to help you
find a leopard...

1220
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:20,046
so that your Aunt Elizabeth
won't be angry at you.

1221
01:06:20,046 --> 01:06:23,871
And then she'll probably give you
the $1 million I need for my museum.

1222
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:28,922
If you'd planned it, you couldn't have
ruined my chances more completely.

1223
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:32,704
You told your aunt I was crazy, didn't you?

1224
01:06:32,704 --> 01:06:36,252
You told her my name was Bone
and you didn't tell me.

1225
01:06:36,252 --> 01:06:38,841
You told her I was a big-game hunter
and didn't tell me.

1226
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:41,206
You tell anybody anything
that comes into your head...

1227
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,731
and you don't tell me.

1228
01:06:43,731 --> 01:06:46,929
- Here's something else I didn't tell you.
- What now?

1229
01:06:46,929 --> 01:06:50,541
Mr. Peabody's coming
to see Aunt Elizabeth tonight.

1230
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:54,366
Oh, dear. That's the end, that's all.

1231
01:06:54,601 --> 01:06:57,605
Peabody's sure to tell your aunt who I am.

1232
01:06:57,605 --> 01:07:00,098
He'll never remember
those four years' hard work...

1233
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:02,752
I put in on that brontosaurus. No.

1234
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:06,578
All he'll remember is that I conked him
on the head with a rock last night.

1235
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:10,999
Where's that music coming from, David?

1236
01:07:10,999 --> 01:07:14,611
Westlake. There's a circus there. A...

1237
01:07:14,611 --> 01:07:16,752
<i>Come and see the Harem Nights, boys.</i>

1238
01:07:16,752 --> 01:07:20,077
<i>Sheena and Neema. They've just escaped
from the palace of a sheik.</i>

1239
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:21,516
The owner's got a job for you.

1240
01:07:21,516 --> 01:07:23,529
He wants you to take his leopard
to Bridgeport.

1241
01:07:23,529 --> 01:07:26,342
- What happened?
- Just gave his new trainer a going-over.

1242
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,397
Hurt him bad?

1243
01:07:27,397 --> 01:07:30,369
Bad? You think three minutes alone
with that cat did him any good?

1244
01:07:30,369 --> 01:07:33,119
Should've shot him last summer,
when he ripped up Calhouney.

1245
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,397
What do we do with him?

1246
01:07:34,397 --> 01:07:37,019
Deliver him to this address.
They've got a gas chamber.

1247
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,928
- I've phoned over. You go along, too, Mac.
- Who, me?

1248
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:42,293
- You heard what I said.
- Where is Bridgeport?

1249
01:07:42,293 --> 01:07:44,402
How should I know?
Somewhere on the state highway.

1250
01:07:44,402 --> 01:07:47,248
Ask somebody, and get going.

1251
01:07:47,248 --> 01:07:50,125
- Well, that's that. Let's get going.
- All right.

1252
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:51,404
Sure you don't want my coat?

1253
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:55,229
- No, I'm completely dry.
- Let's go, then.

1254
01:07:55,943 --> 01:07:59,768
I wonder what that is?

1255
01:08:01,503 --> 01:08:04,413
Hey, Mac, see what that sign says.

1256
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,619
- David, it's the zoo truck.
- Is it?

1257
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:08,920
They've got Baby.

1258
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,327
Is George with him?

1259
01:08:10,327 --> 01:08:13,171
I can't see George, but we've got
to get Baby away from them.

1260
01:08:13,171 --> 01:08:15,697
No. All I promised to do
was help you find Baby.

1261
01:08:15,697 --> 01:08:16,687
You found him.

1262
01:08:16,687 --> 01:08:19,660
All you have to do is go
and talk to those men in the front...

1263
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,675
while I let Baby out the back.
Give me the rope.

1264
01:08:21,675 --> 01:08:22,953
But what'll I say to them?

1265
01:08:22,953 --> 01:08:25,382
They're from the zoo.
Tell them you're a zoologist.

1266
01:08:25,382 --> 01:08:29,208
Talk about zoos. Go ahead, go on.

1267
01:08:29,378 --> 01:08:31,040
I can't find Bridgeport.

1268
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,373
You've got the map upside down.

1269
01:08:33,373 --> 01:08:36,377
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Hello.

1270
01:08:36,377 --> 01:08:37,785
May I help you?

1271
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:41,110
Yeah. Do you know the way to Bridgeport?

1272
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,708
I'm not going to Bridgeport.

1273
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:45,616
Not you. We're going to Bridgeport.
Do you know which way it is?

1274
01:08:45,616 --> 01:08:47,631
- Yes.
- It's that way, ain't it?

1275
01:08:47,631 --> 01:08:51,456
- Yes.
- But I thought it was that way.

1276
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:53,512
- Yes, it is.
- There, I told you.

1277
01:08:53,512 --> 01:08:56,485
Don't you worry. I'll soon get you out.

1278
01:08:56,485 --> 01:08:58,371
Come on.

1279
01:08:58,371 --> 01:09:00,449
Get this around your neck,
that's a good boy.

1280
01:09:00,449 --> 01:09:03,006
Put your head through. Come on.

1281
01:09:03,006 --> 01:09:05,755
Hey, what's the big idea? Come on.

1282
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:08,184
Put your head through here,
and I'll take you back home.

1283
01:09:08,184 --> 01:09:10,295
Come on, sweetie.

1284
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:13,395
...and New York is straight ahead.

1285
01:09:13,395 --> 01:09:15,280
This guy ain't got all his buttons.

1286
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,062
Well, I... You see...

1287
01:09:18,062 --> 01:09:20,619
- We have a...
- David, he's escaped!

1288
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:23,431
- I was just explaining to these gentlemen...
- He's escaped!

1289
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:26,341
Oh, he's escaped.
Shall we help you tie him up, lady?

1290
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:28,769
No, not me. You're mistaken.

1291
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:32,594
Goodnight, gentlemen.

1292
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:42,068
Over there.
We're on the right track now, I'm sure.

1293
01:09:42,068 --> 01:09:43,090
Do you see him?

1294
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:45,456
- I think he's further down this way.
- I'll try here.

1295
01:09:45,456 --> 01:09:49,281
I'm absolutely certain the sound's coming
from this way.

1296
01:09:49,387 --> 01:09:52,073
- What's that?
- Somebody's shooting at him.

1297
01:09:52,073 --> 01:09:54,981
- You missed it again.
- Quiet!

1298
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:57,475
Major Applegate, don't shoot.

1299
01:09:57,475 --> 01:09:59,936
Stand back, please. I won't miss this time.

1300
01:09:59,936 --> 01:10:02,333
You don't understand.
We're trying to catch it.

1301
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:04,506
- You are? Well, so am I.
- It's a tame leopard.

1302
01:10:04,506 --> 01:10:08,216
I don't like to say so at this moment,
but everybody knows you're crazy.

1303
01:10:08,216 --> 01:10:10,356
- Please don't do that.
- Miss Susan, please!

1304
01:10:10,356 --> 01:10:13,617
Why don't you explain to him?
Perhaps he'll catch your leopard.

1305
01:10:13,617 --> 01:10:17,007
You know that Aunt Elizabeth was
expecting a leopard from Brazil, don't you?

1306
01:10:17,007 --> 01:10:20,044
- I had heard that.
- Well, that's her leopard, and it's tame.

1307
01:10:20,044 --> 01:10:23,868
Impossible. There can be no such thing
as a tame...

1308
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:25,828
A tame leopard?

1309
01:10:25,828 --> 01:10:27,555
We had it locked up and it escaped.

1310
01:10:27,555 --> 01:10:29,569
- Are you sure it's quite harmless?
- Absolutely.

1311
01:10:29,569 --> 01:10:32,446
My goodness,
why didn't you say so in the first place?

1312
01:10:32,446 --> 01:10:36,121
I apologize to you, Mr. Boney, I really do.

1313
01:10:36,121 --> 01:10:38,998
Even though it is tame,
I think we should try to catch it.

1314
01:10:38,998 --> 01:10:41,173
Which way did it go?

1315
01:10:41,173 --> 01:10:42,450
That way.

1316
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,680
We'll go that way, you go that way.
Come on, David. Don't shoot.

1317
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,504
No, of course not.

1318
01:10:51,368 --> 01:10:52,998
I knew all the time he was tame.

1319
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:55,907
- Is that so?
- Yes, I patted him on the back.

1320
01:10:55,907 --> 01:10:58,657
Stretched me hand right out,
patted him on the back.

1321
01:10:58,657 --> 01:11:01,214
- He's as gentle as a kitty.
- Gentle as a kitty?

1322
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:03,836
I don't know
why you didn't mention all this...

1323
01:11:03,836 --> 01:11:05,434
There he is.

1324
01:11:05,434 --> 01:11:09,258
This will all be quite simple.
Let me have that rope, will you?

1325
01:11:09,428 --> 01:11:12,658
Now, you hold the gun.
We shan't need that any further.

1326
01:11:12,658 --> 01:11:16,270
Gogarty, you stand perfectly still
and leave everything to me.

1327
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:19,850
I've had vast experience in these matters.

1328
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:22,216
Here, kitty.

1329
01:11:22,216 --> 01:11:26,041
Come, kitty.

1330
01:11:27,681 --> 01:11:29,407
Don't you fool me.

1331
01:11:29,407 --> 01:11:33,232
You're not afraid of me, now, are you?
Come, puss.

1332
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:35,642
You say you patted this beast?

1333
01:11:35,642 --> 01:11:39,466
In a manner of speaking, I did.

1334
01:11:40,851 --> 01:11:44,678
Personally, Gogarty, I think you're a liar.

1335
01:11:47,372 --> 01:11:49,706
Get out of me way!

1336
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:53,531
Use the gun!

1337
01:11:55,619 --> 01:11:57,633
- You see him, David?
- No.

1338
01:11:57,633 --> 01:12:01,181
I seem to have lost my sense of direction.
I wonder where we are.

1339
01:12:01,181 --> 01:12:05,006
My guess is, somewhere
near the Canadian border by now.

1340
01:12:07,254 --> 01:12:09,940
My glasses! Don't move, Susan.

1341
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,049
Here they are.

1342
01:12:12,049 --> 01:12:15,470
They're broken. I'm so sorry.

1343
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,484
It doesn't make any difference.

1344
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:21,309
The things I've been doing today,
I can do just as well with my eyes shut.

1345
01:12:23,334 --> 01:12:25,731
Anyway, David, you look much handsomer
without them.

1346
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:26,913
Stop it.

1347
01:12:26,913 --> 01:12:30,739
Look, David, I've lost my heel!
Look at me walk.

1348
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:36,151
- Born on the side of a hill.
- Stop.

1349
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:39,828
- I was born on the side of a hill.
- Stop.

1350
01:12:39,828 --> 01:12:42,641
Look, Susan,
we're not getting anywhere like this.

1351
01:12:42,641 --> 01:12:45,550
You must be very tired,
and I suggest you go home.

1352
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,755
But, David, we can't quit now.

1353
01:12:47,755 --> 01:12:50,600
We've let a wild animal loose
on an innocent countryside.

1354
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,285
We can't just go home and sleep.
It wouldn't be right.

1355
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:57,110
You misunderstand me.
I want you to go home.

1356
01:12:58,559 --> 01:13:02,385
- You mean you want me to go home?
- Yes.

1357
01:13:02,907 --> 01:13:05,911
You mean you don't want me
to help you anymore?

1358
01:13:05,911 --> 01:13:08,470
- No.
- After all the fun we've had?

1359
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:11,378
- Yes.
- And after all the things I've done for you?

1360
01:13:11,378 --> 01:13:12,432
That's what I mean.

1361
01:13:12,432 --> 01:13:15,404
All right, I know enough
to go when I'm not wanted.

1362
01:13:15,404 --> 01:13:19,231
And don't you worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

1363
01:13:19,943 --> 01:13:22,597
Oh, my goodness.

1364
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:24,675
Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself?

1365
01:13:24,675 --> 01:13:28,447
No, I didn't hurt myself. It's not that.

1366
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:32,251
It's just that I'm miserable
because you don't like me anymore.

1367
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:33,305
Yes, I do.

1368
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:36,055
You tried to get rid of me
and you don't think of me.

1369
01:13:36,055 --> 01:13:38,004
You don't like me anymore.

1370
01:13:38,004 --> 01:13:41,809
Your face is dirty.

1371
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:43,854
Now you're being nice to me...

1372
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:47,680
after all the horrible things
I've done to you.

1373
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:50,023
Stop crying, Susan, please.

1374
01:13:50,023 --> 01:13:53,348
It's just that everything I do
with the best intentions...

1375
01:13:53,348 --> 01:13:55,203
seems to turn out badly.

1376
01:13:55,203 --> 01:13:57,472
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

1377
01:13:57,472 --> 01:14:01,298
Please let me come with you.

1378
01:14:05,111 --> 01:14:07,796
All right, Susan. You can come with me.

1379
01:14:07,796 --> 01:14:10,769
- Are you sure you want me?
- Yes.

1380
01:14:10,769 --> 01:14:14,030
- Positive?
- Yes, you can come. Come on.

1381
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,268
Well, don't you worry, David.

1382
01:14:16,268 --> 01:14:18,761
Because if there's anything
that I can do to help you...

1383
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:22,437
just let me know, and I'll do it.

1384
01:14:22,437 --> 01:14:26,262
Don't do it until I let you know.

1385
01:14:33,497 --> 01:14:37,322
Come on, George.

1386
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,765
Look, David. Baby's on the roof.

1387
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:45,964
Come on, Baby. Come on down.

1388
01:14:45,964 --> 01:14:47,945
Make him get down.

1389
01:14:47,945 --> 01:14:51,771
I suppose you'd like me
to climb up and push him down.

1390
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:55,734
Maybe we'd better sing.

1391
01:14:55,777 --> 01:14:59,602
Sing, David.

1392
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:39,720
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back!

1393
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:44,237
Not you, it.

1394
01:15:44,237 --> 01:15:47,976
- What are you doing, may I ask?
- Singing.

1395
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:51,173
If you're paying a bet,
there must be somewhere else to pay it.

1396
01:15:51,173 --> 01:15:54,114
I'm not paying a bet,
there's a leopard on your roof.

1397
01:15:54,114 --> 01:15:57,940
I'm not going to bandy words
with you at this time of night.

1398
01:15:58,302 --> 01:16:00,346
There is a leopard on your roof,
and it's mine.

1399
01:16:00,346 --> 01:16:02,745
I have to get it,
and to get it, I have to sing.

1400
01:16:02,745 --> 01:16:03,960
There's nothing on my roof.

1401
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,260
Come on, you fool.
There's nothing on your roof?

1402
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:10,087
- No!
- All right. There's nothing on your roof.

1403
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:16,734
Poor girl. You'd better go down, Fritz.

1404
01:16:17,288 --> 01:16:21,114
- Sing if you like, dear.
- Thank you.

1405
01:16:21,157 --> 01:16:24,982
You can sing, too.

1406
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:30,139
Baby, don't! Why did you have to do that?
You frightened him away.

1407
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:32,088
- Quiet, it's all right.
- It's not all right.

1408
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,582
- Don't worry.
- I have to worry. I've lost my leopard.

1409
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:36,788
- Please help me find him.
- I will. Come with me.

1410
01:16:36,788 --> 01:16:38,898
- But he went that way.
- No, he didn't.

1411
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:41,582
- Yes, he did. I saw him.
- You're wrong. He's up there.

1412
01:16:41,582 --> 01:16:45,408
- Where?
- Peeking around the corner. See it?

1413
01:16:47,879 --> 01:16:49,734
There's nothing there!

1414
01:16:49,734 --> 01:16:51,971
Yes, there is.
You just come along into the house.

1415
01:16:51,971 --> 01:16:53,729
Let me go! I don't want to go with you.

1416
01:16:53,729 --> 01:16:56,574
You don't seem to understand
that there's $1 million at stake.

1417
01:16:56,574 --> 01:16:59,483
$1 million? Well, you will get it.

1418
01:16:59,483 --> 01:17:02,520
We have it right in there, all in $1 bills.

1419
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,638
Now you come along.

1420
01:17:03,638 --> 01:17:07,463
No! Don't do this to me! This is awful!

1421
01:17:17,703 --> 01:17:20,868
Elmer, look.

1422
01:17:20,868 --> 01:17:24,693
- You know him?
- No. Looks like a peeping Tom.

1423
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:29,616
Get your gun out. We'll nab him.

1424
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,732
Stick them up.

1425
01:17:35,732 --> 01:17:39,248
Grab him, Elmer.

1426
01:17:39,248 --> 01:17:41,837
I have to get my dog.
Don't go away, George!

1427
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:45,662
Don't argue. Inside.

1428
01:17:48,871 --> 01:17:52,577
- What are you doing?
- I have a hairpin.

1429
01:17:52,577 --> 01:17:54,176
I did it once with a trunk.

1430
01:17:54,176 --> 01:17:56,893
Anyway, when they find out who we are,
they'll let us out.

1431
01:17:56,893 --> 01:18:00,718
When they find out who you are,
they'll pad the cell.

1432
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:05,493
We've picked up a girl
who says she's your niece.

1433
01:18:05,493 --> 01:18:08,657
Now, the question is,
have you or have you not got a niece?

1434
01:18:08,657 --> 01:18:12,332
Of course I have a niece, but she's not
singing around under windows.

1435
01:18:12,332 --> 01:18:13,738
She's decently in bed.

1436
01:18:13,738 --> 01:18:16,200
I wouldn't be too sure, Elizabeth.

1437
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,886
Horace, do be quiet.
I'll talk to you presently.

1438
01:18:18,886 --> 01:18:21,954
Now, lady, do you definitely refuse
to come and identify this girl?

1439
01:18:21,954 --> 01:18:24,671
If you continue to annoy me
about this girl...

1440
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:28,475
who is no responsibility of mine,
I'll have you arrested.

1441
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:31,703
- The idea.
- Hello.

1442
01:18:31,703 --> 01:18:33,334
She says her niece is in bed.

1443
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:35,476
Just what I expected. That girl is lying.

1444
01:18:35,476 --> 01:18:39,183
- I think they're both lying.
- What are you going to do about it?

1445
01:18:39,183 --> 01:18:40,941
- What would you do?
- Find out the truth.

1446
01:18:40,941 --> 01:18:43,244
You're right.
I'll have a little talk with them.

1447
01:18:43,244 --> 01:18:47,068
Come on, Elmer. Open her up.

1448
01:18:47,367 --> 01:18:50,468
You two, get your ears up
'cause I've got something to tell you.

1449
01:18:50,468 --> 01:18:52,737
- If you wanna get out, better listen.
- I'm listening.

1450
01:18:52,737 --> 01:18:54,335
Quiet. I'll get to you later.

1451
01:18:54,335 --> 01:18:56,349
I want you to tell me the whole truth.

1452
01:18:56,349 --> 01:18:58,523
- What did my aunt say?
- Be quiet, please.

1453
01:18:58,523 --> 01:19:00,185
What did my aunt say?

1454
01:19:00,185 --> 01:19:03,030
Your aunt said...
Young lady, you haven't got an aunt.

1455
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,491
- I certainly have got an aunt.
- Quiet, please.

1456
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,952
Look here, young fellow,
I want you to tell me...

1457
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:09,999
just exactly what were you doing tonight?

1458
01:19:09,999 --> 01:19:13,130
- We were hunting for a leopard.
- You were hunting for a leopard?

1459
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:15,432
Now look here, young lady,
you know that's silly.

1460
01:19:15,432 --> 01:19:18,565
- There never was a leopard in Connecticut.
- There is now.

1461
01:19:18,565 --> 01:19:19,589
Now, listen here.

1462
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:23,414
I'm going to stay here if it takes all year.
I am waiting for you to tell the truth.

1463
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,035
If you wait for her to tell the truth,
you'll have a long gray beard.

1464
01:19:27,035 --> 01:19:29,305
You know, my grandfather had... Quiet!

1465
01:19:29,305 --> 01:19:31,958
Young man, I don't want
any more slick remarks out of you.

1466
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:34,100
This is a jail.
Have a little respect for the law.

1467
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,539
I'm just trying to explain.

1468
01:19:35,539 --> 01:19:38,799
It all started over at my aunt...
Her aunt's house.

1469
01:19:38,799 --> 01:19:40,141
Her aunt's house?

1470
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:43,967
- Her aunt promised to give me a lot of...
- Hold on there, bub. Just a minute.

1471
01:19:44,265 --> 01:19:45,287
She hasn't got an aunt.

1472
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:47,142
I do. She's my father's sister.

1473
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:49,730
Look here, Constable,
stop wasting your time. Now, quiet.

1474
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:52,289
You want us to get out of here, don't you?

1475
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:54,334
Lady, yes, I certainly do.

1476
01:19:54,334 --> 01:19:57,115
I gave you my aunt's telephone number,
didn't I?

1477
01:19:57,115 --> 01:20:00,920
And you called her up, didn't you?
What did she say?

1478
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,893
- She said that you were home in bed.
- Then what am I doing here?

1479
01:20:03,893 --> 01:20:06,832
You're here because your aunt...

1480
01:20:06,832 --> 01:20:09,550
Confound it, lady,
you know that you haven't got an aunt.

1481
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:11,628
- If I did have an aunt...
- She'd muzzle you.

1482
01:20:11,628 --> 01:20:13,545
You can't talk to me that way.

1483
01:20:13,545 --> 01:20:17,061
I don't like to see young people in jail.
I have children of my own.

1484
01:20:17,061 --> 01:20:20,386
I don't care about your family.
All I want to do is get out of here.

1485
01:20:20,386 --> 01:20:24,190
I don't have time to waste
sitting around in jail.

1486
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:26,428
- Go away, please.
- Shut up, David.

1487
01:20:26,428 --> 01:20:30,252
- David, please be quiet.
- Let me tell you what happened.

1488
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,762
You're not going to get anywhere
with her. Just come with me.

1489
01:20:35,762 --> 01:20:39,022
If one of us talks at a time,
now we're really getting somewhere.

1490
01:20:39,022 --> 01:20:41,258
Now then, speak up, speak fast.

1491
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:43,817
- I'll explain the whole thing...
- Elmer!

1492
01:20:43,817 --> 01:20:47,643
Get the key here, quick. Lock him up.

1493
01:20:48,005 --> 01:20:49,507
A fine officer you are.

1494
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:51,871
Locking up a dangerous criminal
without locking him up.

1495
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:54,717
- Look, it's not locked.
- Thank you.

1496
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:58,138
I've seen it!
I've seen a cheetah in the park.

1497
01:20:58,138 --> 01:20:59,991
You have no right to do that!

1498
01:20:59,991 --> 01:21:03,444
What's going on here?

1499
01:21:03,444 --> 01:21:06,065
- Here's something for you, Constable.
- What's the charge?

1500
01:21:06,065 --> 01:21:09,889
We caught him in front of the meat market
in Dr. Lehman's stolen car.

1501
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:12,490
So you're a car thief?

1502
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,888
No man is going
to call Aloysius Gogarty a car thief.

1503
01:21:14,888 --> 01:21:16,869
Come on!

1504
01:21:16,869 --> 01:21:17,956
Lock him up.

1505
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,162
Hey, let go!

1506
01:21:20,162 --> 01:21:23,614
Here you are, fellow.
This should hold you for a while.

1507
01:21:23,614 --> 01:21:24,989
Hello, Gogarty.

1508
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:27,896
Hello, Miss Susan. How did you get here?

1509
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:29,271
Influence.

1510
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:31,062
Don't worry, Gogarty. I'll get you out.

1511
01:21:31,062 --> 01:21:33,236
Sure. Look, she got me out.

1512
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:35,057
Hold on here.
Do you know this young lady?

1513
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:37,135
Of course. Don't I work for her aunt?

1514
01:21:37,135 --> 01:21:40,491
- You what?
- Don't I work for her aunt?

1515
01:21:40,491 --> 01:21:43,240
If one more person mentions
that she's got an aunt...

1516
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,598
I'll put you all
on bread and water for 30 days.

1517
01:21:46,598 --> 01:21:49,250
Well, where is everyone?

1518
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,368
Who's in charge here?

1519
01:21:50,368 --> 01:21:52,160
Right in there. Hey, Constable!

1520
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,917
What do you mean
by locking up my niece?

1521
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,675
I won't stand for it! Give me the keys.

1522
01:21:55,675 --> 01:21:57,081
Madam, you're hysterical.

1523
01:21:57,081 --> 01:21:59,128
- What is it you want?
- She wants her niece.

1524
01:21:59,128 --> 01:22:01,365
I certainly do. I want my niece right here.

1525
01:22:01,365 --> 01:22:03,667
- Who is your niece?
- Give us a description of her.

1526
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:06,287
- She's about so tall...
- Aunt Elizabeth, is that you?

1527
01:22:06,287 --> 01:22:07,630
There she is now.

1528
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:10,443
Hold on just a minute.
Lady, tell me, who are you?

1529
01:22:10,443 --> 01:22:12,841
I am Mrs. Carleton Random,
and I want my niece.

1530
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:14,919
- You're Mrs. Carleton Random?
- I certainly am.

1531
01:22:14,919 --> 01:22:17,700
- And you say your niece is here?
- She certainly is.

1532
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,482
That's where I got you.
The young lady here ain't got no aunt.

1533
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:23,486
And you're not Mrs. Carleton Random,
because I talked to her...

1534
01:22:23,486 --> 01:22:25,021
on the phone not 10 minutes ago.

1535
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:27,001
I ought to know who I am!

1536
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:30,102
Yes, you should, I think.
You did talk to her 10 minutes ago...

1537
01:22:30,102 --> 01:22:31,126
on the phone.

1538
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:32,660
- How do you know?
- I was there.

1539
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:35,952
- Who are you?
- I'm the niece... I'm the aunt...

1540
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:38,413
I'm Major Horace Applegate
of the Explorer's Club.

1541
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:40,108
What are you doing with that gun?

1542
01:22:40,108 --> 01:22:43,496
I have been hunting a leopard.

1543
01:22:43,496 --> 01:22:46,405
- You've been hunting leopards?
- I said so, yes.

1544
01:22:46,405 --> 01:22:48,737
- Any luck?
- Not what I'm accustomed to, no.

1545
01:22:48,737 --> 01:22:51,582
I have been a bit confused
regarding the leopards here.

1546
01:22:51,582 --> 01:22:55,408
- Boys.
- You have something on your mind.

1547
01:22:59,511 --> 01:23:02,451
Not so fast, lady. We just want to find out.

1548
01:23:02,451 --> 01:23:05,327
This old battle-ax keeps
yelling that she's Mrs. Random.

1549
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:07,502
Why, that's ridiculous.

1550
01:23:07,502 --> 01:23:09,739
Mrs. Random is in bed.

1551
01:23:09,739 --> 01:23:13,565
And don't you be calling up here again.
Good night.

1552
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:18,306
Good night. Well, just as you said, doc,
they're all lying.

1553
01:23:18,306 --> 01:23:22,078
Obviously. I have no doubt you'll find
you made a very important haul.

1554
01:23:22,078 --> 01:23:23,419
Yeah, thanks to you, doc.

1555
01:23:23,419 --> 01:23:27,245
If you get their confessions,
there'll be a lot of things you will turn up.

1556
01:23:27,288 --> 01:23:31,114
Yeah? Well, I'll try it again. Come on, boys.

1557
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:40,234
Quiet!

1558
01:23:40,234 --> 01:23:42,632
I'm warning you.
The first one who lets a squeak out...

1559
01:23:42,632 --> 01:23:44,358
I'll put in solitary confinement.

1560
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:47,235
I'm gonna ask this man some questions.
I want absolute quiet.

1561
01:23:47,235 --> 01:23:49,089
You said your name's Bone.
You stick to it?

1562
01:23:49,089 --> 01:23:52,605
Won't do any good, we don't believe you.
We know that's an alias.

1563
01:23:52,605 --> 01:23:55,706
- They're all impersonators.
- Why'd you try to break into his house?

1564
01:23:55,706 --> 01:23:57,049
I was after a leopard.

1565
01:23:57,049 --> 01:23:59,062
Leopard. Doc, they still stick to it.

1566
01:23:59,062 --> 01:24:01,364
All agreed on one story.

1567
01:24:01,364 --> 01:24:03,249
How about that bank robbery in Oldtown?

1568
01:24:03,249 --> 01:24:05,135
What about it? How much did they get?

1569
01:24:05,135 --> 01:24:07,405
They got a pretty penny.
Must've got $5,600...

1570
01:24:07,405 --> 01:24:09,292
Say, who's asking the questions,
you or me?

1571
01:24:09,292 --> 01:24:12,039
Who was with you last month
in that mail-truck job?

1572
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:15,108
Mickey the Mouse and Donald the Duck.

1573
01:24:15,108 --> 01:24:17,059
Doc, make a note of their names.

1574
01:24:17,059 --> 01:24:19,745
Now we're getting someplace.
You've gotta speak up.

1575
01:24:19,745 --> 01:24:21,662
Quiet, lady. I'm waiting for you.

1576
01:24:21,662 --> 01:24:23,355
Quiet, lady. Speak up now.

1577
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:26,105
Hey, flatfoot!

1578
01:24:26,105 --> 01:24:28,982
You ain't getting no place. Come here.

1579
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:32,808
- Me?
- Yes, you. Come on, haul it over.

1580
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:34,863
You want someone to talk, don't you?

1581
01:24:34,863 --> 01:24:36,973
It's about time. I certainly do.

1582
01:24:36,973 --> 01:24:40,297
Get me out and I'll unbutton
my puss and shoot the works.

1583
01:24:40,297 --> 01:24:42,918
Say, hold on, lady.
I thought that you were...

1584
01:24:42,918 --> 01:24:45,891
- You ain't no lady!
- I kind of had you fooled, didn't I?

1585
01:24:45,891 --> 01:24:48,448
Always wanted to make a sucker
out of a copper.

1586
01:24:48,448 --> 01:24:50,207
What did I tell you my name was?

1587
01:24:50,207 --> 01:24:54,032
- Your name is... Doc, what's her name?
- Susan Vance.

1588
01:24:54,585 --> 01:24:57,367
Vaunce, kiddie. That's my society moniker.

1589
01:24:57,367 --> 01:25:01,011
But the mob all calls me
"Swinging Door" Susie.

1590
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:03,760
Now you peg me?
Come on, toots, open up.

1591
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,126
- Open up, I'll make you feel hot.
- Stop that.

1592
01:25:06,126 --> 01:25:08,970
I'm not opening any doors here
until you promise to talk.

1593
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:11,431
I talk, I'll talk so much,
it'll make your hair curl.

1594
01:25:11,431 --> 01:25:13,222
Hear that, doc? She's promised to talk.

1595
01:25:13,222 --> 01:25:14,373
All right, open it up.

1596
01:25:14,373 --> 01:25:18,017
Susan, whatever it is, it won't work.

1597
01:25:18,017 --> 01:25:21,841
"Swinging Door" Susie hasn't flopped yet.
I'm out this far, ain't I?

1598
01:25:21,948 --> 01:25:23,867
Well, so long, gang.

1599
01:25:23,867 --> 01:25:27,691
I'm not taking the rap for this job.
It's every man for himself.

1600
01:25:28,597 --> 01:25:32,421
Quiet! I meant what I told you. You, too.

1601
01:25:32,658 --> 01:25:36,482
Quit beefing. Get wise to your pal.
The heat's on, Jerry.

1602
01:25:37,452 --> 01:25:40,072
Ain't his name Bone?

1603
01:25:40,072 --> 01:25:43,206
You mean to say
you don't remember Jerry the Nipper?

1604
01:25:43,206 --> 01:25:44,260
Make a note of that, doc.

1605
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,722
She's making all this up
out of motion pictures.

1606
01:25:46,722 --> 01:25:49,790
I thought I saw you with
that red-headed skirt in a motion picture.

1607
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:51,069
There, doc, another woman.

1608
01:25:51,069 --> 01:25:54,894
Sure. I wouldn't be squealing
if he hadn't been with another twist.

1609
01:25:55,704 --> 01:25:56,888
So he's a lady-killer?

1610
01:25:56,888 --> 01:26:00,371
A lady-killer?
Why, he's a regular Don Swan.

1611
01:26:00,371 --> 01:26:01,809
Loves the ladies, don't you, honey?

1612
01:26:01,809 --> 01:26:05,612
He bops them over. 1, 2, 3, boom!
Just like that.

1613
01:26:05,612 --> 01:26:09,439
- He's a wolf.
- Now I'm a wolf!

1614
01:26:09,769 --> 01:26:11,591
I'll send you a box of birdseed.

1615
01:26:11,591 --> 01:26:14,660
Susie, I want you to tell the truth.
You'll never get into trouble.

1616
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:17,376
You're limping.
I suppose you got shot in a stickup?

1617
01:26:17,376 --> 01:26:19,774
- No, I lost my heel.
- Don't bother about him.

1618
01:26:19,774 --> 01:26:21,851
Sit down there. Doc, grab this chair.

1619
01:26:21,851 --> 01:26:23,738
Elmer, grab a hold of that typewriter.

1620
01:26:23,738 --> 01:26:26,294
I wanna get this whole thing down
in affidavit form.

1621
01:26:26,294 --> 01:26:29,236
- Young lady, I want you to talk...
- Cigarette me, then I'll talk.

1622
01:26:29,236 --> 01:26:31,474
- I don't smoke cigarettes.
- This will have to do.

1623
01:26:31,474 --> 01:26:33,168
- That?
- It's a twofer.

1624
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:36,716
- What's that?
- Two for a nickel. Give me a match.

1625
01:26:36,716 --> 01:26:38,762
I'm not going to stand for that in this jail.

1626
01:26:38,762 --> 01:26:41,064
No smoking, no talking.
Put me back in the cell.

1627
01:26:41,064 --> 01:26:42,981
Ain't gonna talk unless I have a cigarette.

1628
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:46,806
Hold it. Sit down.
Doc, give her one of them cigarettes.

1629
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:51,995
If you'll just tell the truth,
we'll make it as easy as we can...

1630
01:26:51,995 --> 01:26:54,425
My case, if you please.

1631
01:26:54,425 --> 01:26:58,250
There I go again. Sorry. Force of habit.
Forgot where I was for a minute.

1632
01:27:01,137 --> 01:27:03,886
How about a little fresh air?
It's kind of hot in here.

1633
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,421
It is a little bit muggy.

1634
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:08,617
It's always that way around here,
this time of year.

1635
01:27:08,617 --> 01:27:10,791
It's the humidity.

1636
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:12,580
What about the Cleghorn jewels?

1637
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:14,979
That's hot ice.
We're waiting for it to cool off.

1638
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,959
We're waiting... What do you mean, "we"?

1639
01:27:16,959 --> 01:27:18,334
The gang. All of us.

1640
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:20,189
You all belong to the same gang?

1641
01:27:20,189 --> 01:27:22,267
Sure. The Leopard Gang.

1642
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:26,091
That's what I'm after. We'll round them
all up with one fell swoop.

1643
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:28,660
Got that, doc? Fine.
How about you, Elmer?

1644
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,449
Not so fast. This is new to me.

1645
01:27:30,449 --> 01:27:32,784
Hold on.
You can't spell "leopard" with a "U."

1646
01:27:32,784 --> 01:27:34,701
- How do you spell it?
- Double "U."

1647
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:37,961
- What about that bank robbery?
- Boy, wasn't that a honey?

1648
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:41,062
A neater job has never been pulled
in this neck of the woods.

1649
01:27:41,062 --> 01:27:42,916
Jerry was the inside man on that job.

1650
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:44,930
He was, was he? Were you there, too?

1651
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:47,199
Sure, what do you think?
I'm a one-man woman.

1652
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,022
Where my man goes, I go.

1653
01:27:49,022 --> 01:27:50,940
"Babyface" Horace, he's the pick-up man...

1654
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,921
Wait! You're talking too fast!

1655
01:27:55,421 --> 01:27:57,052
What's that?

1656
01:27:57,052 --> 01:28:00,120
Confound it, doc! You only got as far
as the Cleghorn jewels.

1657
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:03,946
We gotta start all over again.
Now, young lady...

1658
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:06,034
- There she goes.
- She's got my car again!

1659
01:28:06,034 --> 01:28:08,783
Go on, boys, after her.
Hurry up and get her.

1660
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:09,807
There she goes.

1661
01:28:09,807 --> 01:28:13,631
Go get her, boys! If you don't,
there'll be a shakeup in this department.

1662
01:28:17,414 --> 01:28:19,204
- Are you the constable?
- Yes.

1663
01:28:19,204 --> 01:28:20,226
I'm looking for...

1664
01:28:20,226 --> 01:28:23,039
Don't tell me you're looking for a leopard.
I'll lock you up.

1665
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:25,565
I'm looking for Mrs. Carleton Random.

1666
01:28:25,565 --> 01:28:28,378
So is everybody else.
Let me tell you, she's not here.

1667
01:28:28,378 --> 01:28:30,582
- I have reason to believe she is here.
- Who're you?

1668
01:28:30,582 --> 01:28:31,893
Her attorney, Alexander Peabody.

1669
01:28:31,893 --> 01:28:35,720
I'm Miss Swallow. I'm looking
for a man by the name of Dr. David Huxley.

1670
01:28:36,081 --> 01:28:37,552
Is he here with Mrs. Random?

1671
01:28:37,552 --> 01:28:41,377
Lady, the only folks here is a woman
who keeps saying she's Mrs. Random.

1672
01:28:41,868 --> 01:28:45,692
Then we got a gangster named Bone.
Then we have "Babyface" Horace. Stop it.

1673
01:28:45,767 --> 01:28:47,141
Then... What is it you want?

1674
01:28:47,141 --> 01:28:48,868
I can identify this gentleman.

1675
01:28:48,868 --> 01:28:52,480
You may remember me. I testified
during the breaking of the Borden will.

1676
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,357
Yes, I remember.
I demand to see my client at once.

1677
01:28:55,357 --> 01:28:56,860
Slocum, you may have made a mistake.

1678
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,553
And if you have made a mistake...

1679
01:28:58,553 --> 01:29:01,717
your position as constable in this county
will be in serious jeopardy.

1680
01:29:01,717 --> 01:29:05,543
- Are you sure he's the old lady's attorney?
- Positively.

1681
01:29:05,778 --> 01:29:08,078
Election next week, too.

1682
01:29:08,078 --> 01:29:11,659
Mr. Peabody, just step right inside,
and we'll straighten this thing out.

1683
01:29:11,659 --> 01:29:14,600
As a matter of fact,
we don't make mistakes.

1684
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,029
Here you are.
Is she or ain't she Mrs. Random?

1685
01:29:17,029 --> 01:29:19,267
It's just about time you came.

1686
01:29:19,267 --> 01:29:22,080
Of course she's Mrs. Random.
This is absurd. Open that door.

1687
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,094
- I told you.
- All right. What about him?

1688
01:29:24,094 --> 01:29:27,162
- David, I don't understand...
- Alice, it's just one of those things.

1689
01:29:27,162 --> 01:29:29,432
I can't explain it.
It happened, and here I am.

1690
01:29:29,432 --> 01:29:31,734
Yes, in the last place
I expected to find you.

1691
01:29:31,734 --> 01:29:34,035
I don't like it any better than you do.

1692
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,633
And let that young man out, too.

1693
01:29:35,633 --> 01:29:38,414
Shucks, looks like I got the whole thing
fuddled up.

1694
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:39,724
I'm sorry, that's all I can say.

1695
01:29:39,724 --> 01:29:43,549
You haven't heard the end of this, either.
I... Huxley!

1696
01:29:44,104 --> 01:29:46,310
Why did you throw rocks at me last night?

1697
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:50,050
This is the young man to whom
you wanted me to donate $1 million...

1698
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:51,104
for his museum?

1699
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,886
Yes. No, I didn't. I changed my mind.

1700
01:29:53,886 --> 01:29:56,155
David, what have you done?

1701
01:29:56,155 --> 01:29:59,980
Just name anything, and I've done it.

1702
01:30:01,589 --> 01:30:02,964
Joe, what are we gonna tell them?

1703
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:06,790
Tell them the truth. We lost the leopard.

1704
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,408
You the constable around here?

1705
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:16,932
Until the next election, anyway.
What is it you want?

1706
01:30:16,932 --> 01:30:20,064
- We need some help.
- That's what I'm here for. What is it?

1707
01:30:20,064 --> 01:30:22,271
We're looking for...

1708
01:30:22,271 --> 01:30:24,700
Don't tell me you're looking for a leopard.

1709
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:27,705
How did you know that?

1710
01:30:27,705 --> 01:30:31,126
- Know what?
- That we're looking for a leopard.

1711
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:34,950
This has gone far enough.
There are no leopards in the state of...

1712
01:30:39,948 --> 01:30:43,208
- Get down, everybody!
- That's a bad cat. Somebody get a gun.

1713
01:30:43,208 --> 01:30:45,990
Hold on, don't be alarmed.
There's no need to be frightened.

1714
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:48,035
Everything's going to be all right.

1715
01:30:48,035 --> 01:30:51,860
Hello, Baby.

1716
01:30:51,902 --> 01:30:55,387
- Is this my leopard?
- Yes. That's Baby.

1717
01:30:55,387 --> 01:30:57,560
He didn't act that way with me.

1718
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:00,022
Wait a minute. That ain't my leopard.

1719
01:31:00,022 --> 01:31:02,772
Of course it isn't.
That's why I took it out of the truck.

1720
01:31:02,772 --> 01:31:04,369
You never let that one out of the truck.

1721
01:31:04,369 --> 01:31:08,194
You couldn't touch our cat
with a 10-foot pole.

1722
01:31:08,621 --> 01:31:10,091
You mean there's another leopard?

1723
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:11,370
That's what I'm telling you.

1724
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:13,831
Our cat came from the circus.
He just clawed a man.

1725
01:31:13,831 --> 01:31:15,269
He's bad.

1726
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:18,497
My goodness! Susan's out
trying to catch the wrong leopard.

1727
01:31:18,497 --> 01:31:22,324
Poor darling Susan. She's in danger,
and she's helpless without me.

1728
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:26,233
What's the matter with you?

1729
01:31:26,233 --> 01:31:29,046
Come on.
If you don't want to walk, I'll drag you.

1730
01:31:29,046 --> 01:31:31,188
You've got to get me out of this, Baby.

1731
01:31:31,188 --> 01:31:34,386
What's the matter? You've been slapping
at me the whole way.

1732
01:31:34,386 --> 01:31:37,869
We've got to get in here. You might
as well come without being stubborn...

1733
01:31:37,869 --> 01:31:40,905
because I'm going to drag you in.

1734
01:31:40,905 --> 01:31:44,731
I'm just as determined as you are,
so you might just as well come with me.

1735
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:48,450
I'm going to drag you in here.

1736
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:52,275
I don't like jail any more than you do,
but this is where we've got to be.

1737
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:01,395
Did I fool you this time!

1738
01:32:01,395 --> 01:32:04,432
You thought I was doing the wrong thing,
but I've got him.

1739
01:32:04,432 --> 01:32:08,257
No, you haven't, Susan. Look!

1740
01:32:13,414 --> 01:32:17,240
Boys! Don't leave me in here!

1741
01:32:23,772 --> 01:32:27,160
David, help me!

1742
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:30,986
Run!

1743
01:32:34,544 --> 01:32:35,951
Run while you have the chance!

1744
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:39,776
- I won't leave you. I love you.
- What?

1745
01:32:48,417 --> 01:32:49,663
Poke him, David.

1746
01:32:49,663 --> 01:32:52,796
Let go, Susan, please.

1747
01:32:52,796 --> 01:32:56,345
Please, go back. Can't you see
I'm trying to get it into the cell?

1748
01:32:56,345 --> 01:32:59,317
Get in there!

1749
01:32:59,317 --> 01:33:03,143
Get the keys, Susan!

1750
01:33:03,216 --> 01:33:07,043
Give it to me.

1751
01:33:08,748 --> 01:33:11,399
You're wonderful.

1752
01:33:11,399 --> 01:33:13,255
You're absolutely wonderful.

1753
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:15,364
You're a hero. You saved my life.

1754
01:33:15,364 --> 01:33:18,145
You'll go down in history.
I've never seen such bravery...

1755
01:33:18,145 --> 01:33:21,970
Did you want to say something?

1756
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:24,697
What was it?

1757
01:33:24,697 --> 01:33:28,502
David, you've fainted.

1758
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:30,867
There's nothing else I can say,
except that I'm glad...

1759
01:33:30,867 --> 01:33:34,257
that before our marriage you showed
yourself up in your true colors.

1760
01:33:34,257 --> 01:33:36,588
You're just a butterfly.

1761
01:33:36,588 --> 01:33:40,414
Now I'm a butterfly.

1762
01:34:01,778 --> 01:34:04,495
Where are you going, David?
Don't go up there.

1763
01:34:04,495 --> 01:34:06,860
I want to talk to you. See? I've got it.

1764
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:09,226
I can't even see you. Now where are you?

1765
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:10,728
There you are.

1766
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:14,276
I followed George around for three days
and dug holes with him.

1767
01:34:14,276 --> 01:34:18,101
And then he came and put it in my shoe.
Darling, look!

1768
01:34:19,327 --> 01:34:21,404
David, don't be mad at me.

1769
01:34:21,404 --> 01:34:25,230
Thank you very much.
Put it down on the table and go away.

1770
01:34:25,591 --> 01:34:27,669
I don't want to go away.
I want to talk to you.

1771
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:29,588
Write me a letter.

1772
01:34:29,588 --> 01:34:32,272
Don't! Go back, Susan!

1773
01:34:32,272 --> 01:34:35,789
Jeepers, it's high up here.

1774
01:34:35,789 --> 01:34:38,858
Please go back down the ladder quietly.

1775
01:34:38,858 --> 01:34:41,735
When I go down,
I'll go down quietly, David...

1776
01:34:41,735 --> 01:34:43,908
but I want to find out something first.

1777
01:34:43,908 --> 01:34:46,337
Why did you run up that ladder
when I came in here?

1778
01:34:46,337 --> 01:34:48,287
If you must know, I'm afraid of you.

1779
01:34:48,287 --> 01:34:52,114
If you're afraid of me,
that's the same as if...

1780
01:34:52,922 --> 01:34:55,512
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.

1781
01:34:55,512 --> 01:34:58,292
Every time you say that,
something happens.

1782
01:34:58,292 --> 01:35:01,585
Please go down because you've already
cost the museum $1 million.

1783
01:35:01,585 --> 01:35:05,410
I haven't. I've got the $1 million.
Aunt Elizabeth gave it to me...

1784
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:09,225
and I'm going to give it to you
for the museum.

1785
01:35:09,225 --> 01:35:11,207
I'm sure they'll be very pleased.

1786
01:35:11,207 --> 01:35:12,708
Aren't you pleased, David?

1787
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:15,553
- Yes, I suppose so, but...
- It's too late, isn't it?

1788
01:35:15,553 --> 01:35:18,016
I've made a mess of everything, haven't I?

1789
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:21,404
I was so happy
when I found the bone this morning.

1790
01:35:21,404 --> 01:35:23,354
If I could only make you understand.

1791
01:35:23,354 --> 01:35:26,743
All that happened, happened because
I was trying to keep you near me.

1792
01:35:26,743 --> 01:35:29,556
I just did anything
that came into my head.

1793
01:35:29,556 --> 01:35:30,896
I'm so sorry.

1794
01:35:30,896 --> 01:35:32,657
I ought to thank you.

1795
01:35:32,657 --> 01:35:34,159
- Thank me?
- Yes.

1796
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:35,789
For what?

1797
01:35:35,789 --> 01:35:39,613
I've just discovered that was the best day
I ever had in my whole life.

1798
01:35:40,455 --> 01:35:44,290
- You don't mean it?
- I've never had a better time.

1799
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:47,072
- But I was there.
- That's what made it so good.

1800
01:35:47,072 --> 01:35:49,980
- Did you really have a good time?
- Yes, I did!

1801
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,347
That's wonderful.
Do you realize what that means?

1802
01:35:52,347 --> 01:35:54,999
That means that you must like me
a little bit.

1803
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,405
- It's more than that.
- Is it?

1804
01:35:56,405 --> 01:35:58,356
Yes. I love you, I think.

1805
01:35:58,356 --> 01:36:02,180
That's wonderful because I love you, too.

1806
01:36:02,287 --> 01:36:03,854
Stop rocking, David.

1807
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:07,680
I'm not rocking. I...

1808
01:36:15,553 --> 01:36:19,379
Please, the brontosaurus!
Four years' work went into this.

1809
01:36:29,139 --> 01:36:32,964
- Look out, Susan, something's going to...
- I'm falling!

1810
01:36:40,743 --> 01:36:43,875
Hold on, Susan! Hold on! Don't let go!

1811
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:46,816
David, look what I've done.

1812
01:36:46,816 --> 01:36:50,641
I'm so sorry.

1813
01:36:51,226 --> 01:36:54,679
David, can you ever forgive me?

1814
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:57,300
You can, and you still love me.

1815
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:01,126
- Susan, that...
- You do.
