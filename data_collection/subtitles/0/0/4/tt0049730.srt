1
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,887
That's your Uncle Ethan!

2
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,402
Welcome home, Ethan.

3
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,245
You ain't much bigger
than when I last saw you!

4
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,524
I'm Deborah.

5
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,408
There's Lucy over there.

6
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,609
And you're Lucy?

7
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,046
Yeah, I'm Lucy. I'm mighty glad
to see you, Uncle Ethan.

8
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,799
She's got a fella. Kisses him, too!

9
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,526
Go on with Lucy and help with supper.

10
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,248
Deborah, you too!

11
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,566
I was just gonna ask Uncle Ethan
what he's gonna do with his saber.

12
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,210
Well, I kind of figured to give it to you.

13
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,647
Thanks. Thanks, Uncle Ethan.

14
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,481
-How was California?
-California? How should I know?

15
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,201
-Well, Mose Harper told us--
-Mose Harper?

16
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,599
Is that old goat still creekin' around?

17
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,201
Why doesn't somebody bury him?

18
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,045
No, I ain't been to California.

19
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,287
I don't intend to go either.

20
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,840
Supper will be ready
as soon as you wash up.

21
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,602
Let me take your coat.

22
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,882
Welcome home, Ethan.

23
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,004
Thanks, Aaron.

24
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,848
Marty, it's Uncle Ethan!

25
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,723
Debbie, sit down.

26
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,762
Good evening, Uncle Ethan.

27
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,363
Welcome home, sir.

28
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,840
It's Martin. Martin Pawley.

29
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,165
I'm sorry for bein' late, Aunt Martha.

30
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,208
A fella could mistake you for a half-breed.

31
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,320
Not quite, I'm an eighth Cherokee
and the rest Welsh and English.

32
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,682
Least that's what they tell me.

33
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,805
Go on, son.

34
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,688
It was Ethan who found you
squallin' under a sage clump...

35
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,647
...after your folks had been massacred.

36
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,086
It just happened to be me.
No need to make more of it.

37
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,609
Thank you, Lucy.

38
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,721
Good night, Aunt Martha.

39
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,649
Good night, Martin.

40
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,800
-Uncle Aaron.
-Good night, Martin.

41
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,368
Good night, Uncle Ethan.

42
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,759
Good night.

43
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,962
Good night, Ma. 'Night, Pa.

44
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,280
Uncle Ethan, will you tell us
about the war?

45
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,326
The war ended three years ago, boy.

46
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,083
It did? So why didn't you come home
before now?

47
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,525
Ben, go on with Martin. March!

48
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,402
Lucy's wearing the gold locket
you gave her when she was a little girl.

49
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,360
She doesn't wear it much
on account of it makes her neck green.

50
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,438
Well, it does!

51
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,762
But, I wouldn't care
if you gave me a gold locket...

52
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,045
...if it made my neck green or not.

53
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,528
A gold locket!
Lucy, where are my saddlebags?

54
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,281
Look at my gold locket!

55
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,808
Oh, it is pretty.

56
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,161
-Ethan, I think she's too young--
-Oh, let her have it.

57
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,808
It doesn't amount to much.

58
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,881
-To bed, young lady!
-Yes, Daddy.

59
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,481
I passed the Todd place comin' in.
What happened?

60
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,088
He gave up, quit,
went back to chopping cotton.

61
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,962
So did the Jamisons.

62
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,648
Without Martha....

63
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,840
She just wouldn't let a man quit.

64
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,969
Ethan, I saw it in you before the war.

65
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,208
You wanted to clear out.

66
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,804
You stayed beyond any real reason. Why?

67
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,525
Are you asking me to clear out now?

68
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,484
You're my brother, Ethan.

69
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,130
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you have a mind to.

70
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,359
Ain't that right, Martha?

71
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,283
-Of course, it is.
-I expect to pay my way.

72
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,080
There are 60 double eagles in there.

73
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,363
And twice that much here. Yankee dollars.

74
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,162
That's fresh minted.

75
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,163
There ain't a mark on it.

76
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,285
So?

77
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,848
Open up! It's Sam Clayton.

78
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,607
Reverend, come on in!

79
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,007
Good morning, Sister Edwards.

80
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,965
What is it, Reverend?

81
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,689
Lars just said somebody
busted into his corral last night...

82
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,488
...and ran off with his best cows.

83
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,038
Yeah, next time I'll raise pigs, by golly!

84
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,963
You never hear of anyone runnin' off pigs,
I bet you!

85
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,087
-Bumblebees, by golly!
-Coffee'll be just fine, Sister.

86
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,689
Good morning, Lucy.

87
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,362
Debbie, you been baptized yet?

88
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,442
-No, sir, I haven't. No.
-Aaron, get Martin, will you?

89
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,729
I can sure use that coffee.
Pass the sugar, son.

90
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,678
Wait a minute, Sister.
I didn't get any coffee yet.

91
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,524
Just hold on a second, Sister.
I'm sure fond of them doughnuts.

92
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,000
Aaron! Martin! Come on up here.

93
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,799
Come on.

94
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,199
-Raise your right hand. Martin?
-Yes, sir.

95
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,769
Raise your right hand.

96
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,604
You're hereby voluntary privates
in Company A of the Texas Rangers...

97
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,127
-...and you will faithfully discharge--
-Can I go with you?

98
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,168
-Quiet! Where was I?
-Faithfully fulfill.

99
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,563
You will faithfully discharge your--

100
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,207
Mrs. Edwards?

101
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,518
Shut up!

102
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,727
You will faithfully discharge your duties,
as such...

103
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,688
...without a recompense
or monetary consideration.

104
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,649
Amen. That means no pay.
Better get a shirt on, Aaron.

105
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,608
I ain't goin' volunteering till
I've had my coffee. Drink your own.

106
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,123
Just call me ''Captain.''

107
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,168
Captain.
The Reverend Samuel Johnson Clayton!

108
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,049
Mighty impressive.

109
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,447
Well...the ''Prodigal Brother''!

110
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,085
When did you get back?
I ain't seen you since the surrender.

111
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,969
Come to think of it,
I didn't see you at the surrender.

112
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,961
I don't believe in surrenders.

113
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,686
I still got my saber, Reverend.

114
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,159
Didn't turn it into no plowshare neither.

115
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,480
The Indians did it, Mrs. Edwards.

116
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,448
Caddos or Kiowas.
Old Mose knows. Yes, sir.

117
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,160
-Oh, shut up, Mose.
-Thank you.

118
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,124
Ethan, I'm countin' on you
to look after things while I'm gone.

119
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,646
-You're not goin'.
-He is going. I already swore him in.

120
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,728
-Swear him out! I'll go with you.
-Ethan, I don't think I should--

121
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,163
Stay close, Aaron.

122
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,721
It might be, this is rustlers.

123
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,768
Might be this dodderin' ol' idiot
ain't so far wrong.

124
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,203
Could be Comanches.

125
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,884
Kind words, Ethan. Thank you kindly.

126
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,481
Children, go with Lucy.

127
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,201
All right. I'll swear you in.

128
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,600
No need to. It wouldn't be legal anyway.

129
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,443
Why not? You wanted for a crime, Ethan?

130
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,564
Coffee, Ethan.

131
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,249
Thank you, Martha.

132
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,967
Are you asking me as a captain
or a preacher, Sam?

133
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,083
I'm asking you as a ranger
of the sovereign state of Texas.

134
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,398
You got a warrant?

135
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,401
You fit a lot of descriptions.

136
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,047
I figure a man's only good
for one oath at a time.

137
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,642
I took mine
to the Confederate States of America.

138
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,769
So did you, Sam.

139
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,283
Stay close, Aaron.

140
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,165
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
We have to be going.

141
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,888
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.

142
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,406
Grateful to the hospitality
of your rocking chair, ma'am.

143
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,720
''Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad''

144
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,923
Debbie and Ben Edwards,
I'm gonna tell Ma on you!

145
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,685
Somethin' mighty fishy
about this trail, Uncle Ethan.

146
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,648
Don't call me ''Uncle.'' I ain't your uncle.

147
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,245
Yes, sir.

148
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,919
No need to call me ''sir'' either.

149
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,278
Nor ''grandpa,'' nor ''Methuselah.''
I can whip you to a frazzle.

150
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,283
What do you want me to call you?

151
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,283
My name is Ethan. Now what's
so mighty fishy about this trail?

152
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,120
-Well, first--
-Look! Look!

153
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,804
Reverend!

154
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,799
Look!

155
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,921
Caddos or Kiowas, huh?

156
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,284
Ain't but one tribe uses a lance like that.

157
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,886
Hey, Pa, your prize bull.
Killed every one of them!

158
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,841
And not for food either.
Why'd they do a thing like that?

159
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,524
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out.

160
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,488
This is a murder raid.

161
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,319
Shapes up to burn down either your place,
or my brother's.

162
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,689
Mama! Laurie!

163
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,925
Oh, please, God! Please, no!

164
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,922
Jorgensen's place is the closest, Ethan.

165
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,922
If they're not there,
we'll come straight on to you.

166
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,525
You do that.

167
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,440
Well, are you coming, or ain't you?

168
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,842
That farm's 40 miles from here, boy.
And these horses need rest and grain.

169
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,289
Ain't Caddos. Ain't Kiowas.

170
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,043
-Break out the grain.
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

171
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,765
Quiet, boy.

172
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,245
I'll see if I can shoot a couple of sage hens
before supper.

173
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,521
Yes, you do that, Aaron.

174
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,529
Ma, the days are getting shorter.

175
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,601
Lucy, we don't need a lamp yet.

176
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,806
Let's just enjoy the dusk.

177
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,728
It's all right, Ma,
I've been watching. Only--

178
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,569
-What, Ben?
-I wish Uncle Ethan was here.

179
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,924
Don't you, Ma?

180
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,403
Close that shutter, Ben, like a good boy.

181
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,485
We're gonna play the ''sleep-out'' game.
Remember?

182
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,719
Where you hide out with Grandma?

183
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,402
Where she is buried?

184
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,323
And you creep along the ditch
very quietly, like--

185
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,084
Like a little mouse.

186
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,001
Hurry up! The moon's fixin' to rise!

187
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,560
You won't make a sound or come back,
no matter what you hear!

188
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,802
-Promise?
-I promise.

189
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,965
-Wait. Can't I have my doll?
-There's no time. There's no time.

190
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,403
Now, down low. Run!

191
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,569
Chris, go back. Go back, Chris! Go back!

192
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,645
Wait a minute, Uncle Ethan.

193
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,403
Next time you'll mind your Uncle Ethan.

194
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,160
-Thank you kindly....
-Wait, Mose! We can ride double, Mose!

195
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,209
Aunt Martha!

196
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,409
Let me in.

197
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,999
-Don't go in there, boy.
-I know she's in there!

198
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,239
Don't go in!

199
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,086
Don't let him look in there.

200
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,121
It won't do him any good.

201
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,008
Put an ''Amen'' to it!

202
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,639
There's no more time for praying. Amen!

203
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,082
Those girls mean as much to me
as though they were my own.

204
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,480
Maybe you don't know that my Brad
has been keeping company with Lucy.

205
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,323
I'd be obliged
if you'd come to the point, ma'am.

206
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,527
It's just that I know
Martha would want you...

207
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,840
...to take care of her boys,
as well as her girls.

208
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,321
If the girls are dead, don't let
the boys waste their lives in vengeance.

209
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,442
Promise me, Ethan!

210
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,080
Come on, if you're going with us!

211
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,043
Captain Clayton!

212
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,044
Another one, huh?
Give me a hand, Charlie.

213
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,084
This one came a long way
before he died, Captain.

214
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,799
Well, Ethan, there's another one
you can score up for your brother.

215
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,120
-I don't like it!
-What don't you like?

216
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,724
Indians on a raid generally hide their dead.

217
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,205
If they don't care anything
about us knowin'...

218
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,167
...it only spells one thing:

219
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,124
They ain't afraid of us following,
or of us catchin' up with them either.

220
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,008
You can back out
any time you want, Nesby.

221
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,522
Ethan, I didn't say that! I didn't say such!

222
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,848
Easy, Nesby, easy.

223
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,446
Why don't you finish the job?

224
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,763
What good did that do you?

225
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,365
By what you preach, none.
But what that Comanche believes...

226
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,160
...ain't got no eyes,
he can't enter the Spirit Land.

227
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,639
Has to wander forever between the winds.

228
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,683
You get it, Reverend.
Come on, Blankethead!

229
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,480
All right, boys. Let's mount up.

230
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,442
They're camped by the river,
about 20 miles from here.

231
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,087
We'll wait till dark, then circle out
so we can jump 'em before daylight.

232
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,919
You're sure you want to jump 'em, Ethan?

233
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,247
That's what we came for, ain't it?

234
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,686
I thought we were tryin'
to get them girls out...alive.

235
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,886
If we jump them Comanches,
they'll kill 'em. You know that.

236
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,280
What are we doing then, Reverend?

237
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,162
What are we supposed to do, Ethan?

238
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,038
Well, what I had in mind was
maybe runnin' off their pony herd.

239
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,729
A Comanche on foot
is more apt to be willin' to listen.

240
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,801
Yeah, I think the Reverend's right.
Don't you?

241
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,040
You think the Reverend's....

242
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,562
What does a quarter-breed Cherokee
know about the old Comanche trick...

243
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,606
...of sleepin' with his best pony
tied right by his side?

244
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,207
You've got about as much chance
of stampeding that herd as--

245
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,839
As you have of finding them girls alive
by raidin' into 'em!

246
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,323
I say we do it my way.
And that's an order!

247
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,085
Yes, sir.

248
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,448
But if you're wrong...

249
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,401
...don't ever give me another!

250
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,049
Well, they were here.

251
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,161
Sure. They were here.

252
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,643
And now they're out there,
waiting to jump us.

253
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,482
Any more orders, ''Captain''?

254
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,006
Yes. We'll keep on going.

255
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,879
Well?

256
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,248
You want to quit, Ethan?

257
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,522
That'll be the day!

258
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,442
-Horses!
-Horses!

259
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,763
Keep on going.

260
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,606
Keep moving! Keep moving!

261
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,599
Well, Reverend, it looks like
you got yourself surrounded.

262
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,003
Yeah, and I figure
I can get myself un-surrounded.

263
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,361
Mose, how far is the river?

264
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,801
I've been baptized, Reverend.
I've been baptized.

265
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,922
-Shut up, you fool.
-Thank you, kindly. Thank you.

266
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,044
You'd better get yourself set
for another one...

267
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,884
...because when I holler,
I want you to move out in a hurry!

268
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,525
Let's go!

269
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,408
-Take it easy, Nesby.
-You'll be all right, Nesby.

270
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,886
Here is my Bible. Hold it.
It'll make you feel good.

271
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,678
Thank you, Reverend.
Thank you very kindly.

272
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,886
Do you think they'll charge us?

273
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,161
-Are you asking me?
-I am.

274
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,168
Well, thank you.

275
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,407
Yep. The Death Song.

276
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,758
The War Chief. He's got to, to save face.

277
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:38,201
Yes, sir. He'll be right in your lap
in a minute, sonny.

278
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,125
For that which we're about to receive,
we thank Thee, O Lord.

279
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,008
You got him, Marty!

280
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,803
Hallelujah!

281
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,249
Dang! Blast it!

282
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,528
Watch it, it's loaded!

283
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,879
Leave them to carry off their hurt
and dead.

284
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,165
Well, Reverend, that does it!

285
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:26,409
From now on, you stay out of this,
all of you! I don't want you with me.

286
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,559
I don't need you for what I've gotta do!

287
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,644
Well, Edwards, I guess you're right.

288
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,122
We gotta get Nesby back.

289
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,566
This is a job for a whole company
of rangers...

290
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,800
...or it's a job for one or two men.

291
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,879
Right now, we're too many
and not enough.

292
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,641
Me, I'm going on alone.

293
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,684
Any objections?

294
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,965
Good luck.

295
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,159
There's only one way you can stop me
from looking for Lucy, mister...

296
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,808
...and that's kill me!

297
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,566
That's the way I feel, Uncle Ethan.

298
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,967
All right. But I'm giving the orders,
you hear?

299
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,921
I'm givin' the orders...

300
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,888
...and you'll follow 'em
or we're splittin' up right here and now.

301
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,369
Sure, Ethan.

302
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,203
There's just one reason we're here, ain't it?
It's to find Debbie and Lucy.

303
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,328
If they're still alive.

304
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,484
Mount up.

305
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,762
They gotta stop sometime.

306
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,290
If they're human men at all,
they gotta stop!

307
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,120
No, a human rides a horse until it dies,
then he goes on afoot.

308
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,128
A Comanche comes along, gets that
horse up, rides him 20 more miles...

309
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,962
...and then he eats him.

310
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,083
Easy on that!

311
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,959
Sorry.

312
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,410
We don't even know if Debbie
and Lucy are in this bunch.

313
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,559
Maybe they split up.

314
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,925
They're with 'em, all right.
If they're still alive.

315
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,841
You've said that enough!

316
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,803
Maybe Lucy's dead.
Maybe they're both dead.

317
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,567
But, if I hear that from you again,
I'll fight you, Mr. Edwards!

318
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,368
That'll be the day!

319
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,565
Spread out!

320
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,642
Found a main trail, but...

321
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:07,760
...four of them cut out here
and rode on up through that pass.

322
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,646
How come they'd do that, Ethan?

323
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,043
I'll take a look. Keep after the others.

324
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,883
If you want us to fire--

325
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,643
No, nor build bonfires, nor beat drums.

326
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,246
I'll meet you on the far side.

327
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,286
Move!

328
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,721
Do you want some water, Ethan?

329
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,082
The trail leads over there.

330
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,963
Why'd they break off?

331
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,281
Was there water in that canyon?

332
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,400
Huh?

333
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,565
No water.

334
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,682
Are you all right, Ethan?

335
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,164
I'm all right.

336
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,768
What happened to your coat?
Did you lose it?

337
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,289
I must have.

338
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,041
But I'm not going back for it!

339
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,760
I found 'em! I found Lucy!

340
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:11,128
They're camped a half-mile over. I was
swinging back and I saw their smoke.

341
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,800
Bellied up a ridge,
and there they were, right below me.

342
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,803
Did you see Debbie?

343
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,645
No, but I saw Lucy all right.
She was wearing that blue dress--

344
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,881
What you saw wasn't Lucy.

345
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,164
Oh, but it was--

346
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,002
What you saw was a buck...

347
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,887
...wearin' Lucy's dress.

348
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,399
I found Lucy back in the canyon.

349
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,161
I wrapped her in my coat.

350
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,201
Buried her with my own hands.

351
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,809
I thought it best to keep it from you.

352
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,889
Did they....

353
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,639
Was she...?

354
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,245
What do you want me to do?
Draw you a picture? Spell it out?

355
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,879
Don't ever ask me! As long as you live,
don't ever ask me more!

356
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,761
I'm awful sorry, Brad.

357
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,164
Wait a minute!

358
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,364
Get back here, Brad! Get back here!

359
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,967
Why don't you say it?

360
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,961
We're beaten, and you know it.

361
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,284
Our turnin' back don't mean nothin'.

362
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,683
Not in the long run.

363
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,160
If she's alive, she's safe.
For a while, they'll keep her...

364
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,968
...and they'll raise her
as one of their own until...

365
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,161
...she's of an age to....

366
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,520
Do you think maybe there's a chance
we still might find her?

367
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:55,445
An Indian will chase a thing
till he thinks he's chased it enough.

368
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,129
Then he quits.

369
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,208
Same way when he runs.

370
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,007
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing as...

371
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,999
...a critter who'll just keep coming on.

372
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,604
So we'll find 'em in the end. I promise you.

373
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,689
We'll find 'em...

374
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,208
...just as sure as the turnin' of the earth!

375
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,288
-Hi, Ethan.
-Hello, sir.

376
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,007
-Hi, Marty.
-How are you, sir?

377
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,929
You got my letter about your son, Brad?

378
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,005
Just about this time a year ago.

379
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:33,800
Oh, Ethan, this country....

380
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,848
Him? Probably forgotten all about you,
can't even call your name to mind!

381
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,083
Her name is Laurie.

382
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,164
But I fairly forgot just how pretty she was.

383
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,762
What about Debbie?

384
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:33,206
Hey, what are you doin' anyway?

385
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,122
Don't go taking that stuff!

386
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,926
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

387
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,888
What are you gettin' so red in the face
about? I got brothers, ain't I?

388
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,961
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

389
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,560
Look here, Martin Pawley, I'm a woman.

390
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,688
We women wash and mend
your dirty clothes all your lives.

391
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,601
When you're little, we even wash you!

392
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,762
How you can ever make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

393
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:58,569
You talk like a fella just
might as well run around naked.

394
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,368
It wouldn't bother me none.

395
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,121
Sure wouldn't try it in front of Pa, though,
if I was you!

396
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,204
''Oh, I got a gal prettier than you''

397
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:25,123
We kept trackin' 'em till the blizzards hit.
Then we lost their trail.

398
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,563
Don't need to tell you where we went:
Fort Richardson, Wingate, Cobb....

399
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:36,568
Trouble is, we don't know which band
the war party belonged to.

400
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,800
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

401
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,403
I got your boy killed.

402
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,328
Don't go blamin' yourself for that.

403
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:46,244
It's this country that killed my boy.
Yes, by golly, I tell you Ethan--

404
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:49,607
Now, Lars, it just so happens
we'd be Texicans.

405
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,082
A Texican is nothing but a human man
way out on a limb.

406
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,728
This year and next....

407
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,005
Maybe for a hundred more.
But I don't think it will be forever.

408
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:04,166
Some day this country's gonna be
a fine good place to be.

409
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,365
Maybe it needs our bones in the ground
before that time can come.

410
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,839
Bedtime.

411
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,641
She was a schoolteacher.

412
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,441
Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight.

413
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,361
Would it be all right
if we give him some of Brad's things?

414
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,122
Of course. They're in Grandma's chest.

415
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,565
Ethan, you're going to sleep
in the bunkhouse.

416
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,199
The letter! In the chest!
It came for you, Ethan, last winter.

417
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,241
Charlie McCorry brought it.

418
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:34,123
I'm looking for that letter
Charlie McCorry.... By Jiminy!

419
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,359
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

420
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,889
Excuse me.

421
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,608
Take a look at this.

422
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,039
Just a snip of calico.

423
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,281
Ever see it before?
Maybe on a dress Debbie wore?

424
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,447
Yes, it was an apron.

425
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,162
Have they found her yet?

426
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,799
Not yet.

427
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:25,765
Not yet.

428
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,241
You might at least have
left me my britches!

429
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,685
It's time for bed anyway.
Here, try these on.

430
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,919
I ain't gonna.

431
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,525
Well, likely they'll need some takin' in.

432
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,248
You're that gaunt.

433
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,926
Ma's having turkey for dinner tomorrow.

434
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,444
Laurie, come. Let the boys get to bed.

435
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,524
All right, Pa.

436
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,205
-Good night, Marty.
-Good night, Laurie.

437
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,290
-'Night, Mr. Edwards.
-'Night, Ms. Jorgensen.

438
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:07,529
Jorgensen's been runnin'
my cattle with his own.

439
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,044
Your cattle?

440
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,488
You mean Debbie's cattle.

441
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:17,241
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

442
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,648
I'm pushin' on tomorrow.

443
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,240
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here!

444
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,605
I started out lookin' for Debbie,
I intend to keep on.

445
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,406
Why?

446
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,765
Why? Well, because she is my--

447
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,407
She's your nothing!
She's no kin to you at all!

448
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,966
I always kind of thought she was.

449
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,720
The way her folks took me in
and raised me....

450
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,448
That don't make you no kin.

451
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:42,602
All right, maybe it don't.
But I intend to keep on lookin' anyway.

452
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,759
How?

453
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,199
You got any horses, or money to buy 'em?

454
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,679
You ain't even got money for cartridges.

455
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:51,364
Jorgensen's offerin' you a good livin' here.

456
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,561
Martin, I want you to know--

457
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,681
I know what you want me to know!

458
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,279
I've got no kin, no money, no horses!

459
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,807
All I got here is a bunch
of dead-man's clothes to wear!

460
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,050
You told me that already,
so, shut your mouth!

461
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,843
Mornin', Laurie.

462
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,080
Mornin', Marty. Did you sleep well?

463
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,804
Well, no.

464
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,161
I kind of tossed and...

465
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,441
...turned and dreamed.

466
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:48,123
I'll get your coffee.

467
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,241
You know, Laurie, I...

468
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,244
...I was thinking maybe it's time
you and me started goin' steady, huh?

469
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,766
You and me have been goin' steady
since we was three years old.

470
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,968
-We have?
-About time you found out about it!

471
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,883
Gosh, Laurie, I've always been fond
of you, but...

472
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,723
...with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I....

473
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,482
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

474
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:19,040
I don't know what you can do
about findin' Debbie that he can't.

475
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,724
He'll find her now, Martin. Honest he will!

476
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,206
That's what I'm afraid of, Laurie,
him finding her!

477
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,209
I've seen his eyes
at the very word ''Comanche.''

478
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,480
I've seen him take his knife and--

479
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,808
Never mind. He's a man
that can go crazy wild!

480
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,848
And I intend to be there to stop him,
in case he does.

481
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,840
I was hopin' I could hold you here,
but I guess I knew better.

482
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,483
I stole that for you.

483
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,242
''I...bought....''

484
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,961
Here, let me read it for you.

485
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,079
''I bought a small-sized dress
off of an Indian.

486
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,606
''If this here's a piece of your child's dress,
bring the reward.

487
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,250
''I know where they've gone.
Jerem Futterman.''

488
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,006
He's got a small trading post
on the south fork of the Brazos.

489
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,604
Listen, I just gotta get me a horse!
Do you think your Pa--

490
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:20,361
Finish your breakfast!

491
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,963
I've got to find him!

492
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,764
-All right, go on and find him!
-Oh, Laurie, don't you understand?

493
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,566
But that's your own good horse!

494
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,488
You take him and welcome!

495
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:44,842
But don't you count on findin' me here
when you get back.

496
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,490
I've been hanging around
this Godforsaken place...

497
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,845
...for two long years waiting for you.

498
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,160
I ain't cut out to be no old maid!

499
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:56,200
I'm sorry, Laurie,
but I just gotta catch up with Ethan.

500
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:59,080
Well, go ahead and catch up with him!

501
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,329
-Futterman?
-Yeah.

502
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:18,925
Let's talk.

503
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,167
You sent me a letter.

504
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,639
Yeah?

505
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,244
About a dress.

506
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,809
How'd you come by it?

507
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,962
-You said there was a $1,000 reward.
-That's what I said.

508
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,642
Got it with you?

509
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,968
You'll get the reward when I find her,
and if she's still alive.

510
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,120
A man's got a right to expect
some kind of payment.

511
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,247
I laid out for that dress
and sendin' you that writing.

512
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:00,845
Twenty Yankee dollars.

513
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,921
A man's time is worth something.

514
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:04,560
Talk.

515
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:09,761
A young buck fetched it in
late last summer.

516
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,364
Said it belonged to a captive child
of Chief Scar.

517
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:13,439
Scar?

518
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,682
We ain't never heard of him, have we?

519
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,648
Me neither. But this buck claimed
he was a big war chief...

520
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,925
-...with the Nawyecky Comanches.
-Keep talkin'.

521
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,719
Scar's band was headed north to winter
at Fort Wingate, eatin' agency beef.

522
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,244
That's what this buck said. Maybe he lied.

523
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:29,364
Maybe you lie.

524
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:32,278
In that case, my friend,
you won't find her...

525
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,600
...and I won't get my $1,000 dollars.

526
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,478
You can spend the night. Cards, a jug--

527
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,958
No thanks.

528
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,801
Don't forget to come back with my $1,000!

529
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,323
It ain't yours yet!

530
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,001
Do you have a feeling
that maybe we're being followed?

531
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,559
That's the Indian in you. Go to sleep.

532
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,444
Them horses there...
they're sure actin' mighty nervous.

533
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,646
They smell a change in the weather.

534
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:12,848
Don't put any more wood on the fire.
I'm burning up.

535
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:15,160
We might get a frost before mornin'.

536
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,799
I'm getting to be like old Mose Harper.

537
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,248
My bones are cold tonight.

538
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:29,723
It's funny, but last winter when
we passed through Fort Wingate...

539
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,564
...I didn't have any recollection of
a mention of Nawyecky Comanches.

540
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:38,082
Not so funny when you recollect
what ''Nawyecky'' means.

541
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:41,083
-What's that?
-Sort of like ''roundabout.''

542
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,567
A man says he's goin' one place,
means to go to the other.

543
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:00,364
Come on, Ethan. Don't put any more wood
on the fire! I'm burning up.

544
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:09,839
Comfortable?

545
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,329
Are you all right?

546
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:15,206
-I'm just saying good night to you.
-Well, good night!

547
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,163
Good night!

548
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,043
Good night!

549
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:27,642
Thanks, you did fine.

550
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,921
Why, that's Futterman!

551
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,527
Ethan, what are you doin' anyway?

552
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:38,807
I'm getting my money back, you idiot!
What do you suppose!

553
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,163
We did all right.

554
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,845
We? Why you just staked me out there,
like a piece of bait!

555
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:53,204
You built up the fire. You fixed it
so I could get my brains blown out!

556
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,608
What if you had missed?

557
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,168
It never occurred to me.

558
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,122
Let's get out of here.

559
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,767
Howdy, Mr. Jorgensen.

560
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:16,925
-Charlie!
-Got me a letter here.

561
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:19,848
By golly, a letter?

562
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,568
It's for Ms. Laurie.

563
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:25,398
Two letters in one year! By golly!

564
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:28,844
Mama! Mama! It's Charlie McCorry.

565
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,966
He's come with a letter.
He's come a courtin' too, by golly!

566
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,448
Good morning, Charlie.

567
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,842
Laurie, here's a letter for you.
Charlie brought it.

568
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:46,005
I figured it might be the news
you've been waiting for, so I--

569
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:47,603
-Thank you, Charlie.
-You're welcome.

570
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,999
Say, I brought you some boiled sweets.

571
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,558
Why, thank you, Charlie!

572
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:54,369
Let's sit down
while Laurie reads the letter.

573
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,045
I reckon, I really ought to be going--

574
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,248
No. You'll stay, Charlie.

575
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:03,688
After all, Charlie brought the letter.
He's got a right to listen too.

576
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:06,922
Come on, read the letter.

577
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,963
But, Ma, it's my letter!

578
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:12,564
Why, sure, but.... Go ahead. Read it.

579
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:22,839
Please.

580
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,288
''Dear Ms. Laury--''

581
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:29,209
He spelled it with a ''y'' instead of an ''ie.''
You'd think he'd know better.

582
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:33,203
Oh, spelling...please!
What's the difference? Read the letter!

583
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:39,039
''Dear Ms. Laury: I take pencil in hand
to let you know...

584
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:44,129
''...Ethan and me are still trying
to catch up with them Comanches...

585
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,764
''...the late Mr. Futterman told us about.''

586
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,403
The ''late'' Mr. Futterman?

587
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:51,958
That means Mr. Futterman is dead,
by golly.

588
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,480
Oh, the poor man! Go ahead, Laurie.

589
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,203
''We cut north through Indian territory...

590
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:02,000
''...and did not have no trouble...

591
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:05,199
''...finding Kiowas and Wichitas...

592
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,766
''...and even some Comanches...

593
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,485
''...camped by one of the agencies.

594
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,680
''But none of them was Nawyeckies...

595
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:17,087
''...nor claimed to know
a war chief called Scar.''

596
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:19,639
Scar?

597
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,846
''He's the one the late Mr. Futterman said
had Debbie.

598
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,086
<i>''At one of the agencies...</i>

599
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,761
<i>''...we outfitted with all kinds of</i>
<i>trade goods...</i>

600
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:39,364
<i>''...figuring that'd make it easier</i>
<i>for us to come and go....</i>

601
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,365
<i>''You'd laugh if I told you...</i>

602
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:48,239
<i>''...what was our biggest seller. ''</i>

603
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,050
Let's go. I think I stumbled
onto something.

604
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,125
Scar...you found him?

605
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:42,565
When are you gonna learn
to keep your big mouth shut?

606
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,288
Get your horse, and let's get out of here!

607
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:47,282
-I just bought me a good blanket.
-Forget it. Move!

608
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,324
I heard that a band of hostile Comanches...

609
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,646
...came through less than a week ago.

610
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,119
I asked if a white girl was with them.

611
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,926
They got sullen and suspicious.

612
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,204
-You think it might have been--
-I don't know!

613
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,320
What's she following us for?

614
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,761
Hey, you! You go on back now!

615
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:19,565
Go on!

616
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:22,848
Look, I changed my mind.
You can keep your blanket.

617
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,969
Look, you don't understand.
I don't want it!

618
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,884
You don't understand, you chunkhead!

619
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:36,283
You didn't buy any blanket,
you bought her!

620
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:39,166
You got yourself a wife, sonny!

621
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:42,564
Oh, no! Ethan, tell her to go back!

622
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:46,042
What? And have her whole family
after our scalps...

623
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:49,361
...for flauntin' one of their womenfolk?
No, sir!

624
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,847
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

625
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,763
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

626
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:55,727
Join our merry group.

627
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,079
Mrs. Pawley?

628
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,807
''There is one other thing I got to tell you...

629
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,964
''...before you hear it from Ethan.

630
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:11,602
''How I got myself...

631
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,444
''...a wife--''

632
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,799
He did?

633
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,125
Good!

634
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:21,881
A young man should get married
early in life. Right, Mama?

635
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,320
Go ahead and read the letter, Laurie.

636
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:33,640
''A little Comanche squaw--''

637
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,239
Squaw!

638
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,088
Laurie, you come back
and read the letter, please!

639
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,841
Come back and read it, please!

640
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,079
Mama, here, you read the letter.

641
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:56,968
My wife was a schoolteacher.
She reads good.

642
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:01,084
I'll read it.

643
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,685
So he married a Comanche squaw.

644
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:14,328
''She wasn't near...

645
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:17,562
''...as old as you--''

646
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,000
How old does he think I am?

647
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,639
Hey, look! Coffee. Me. Coffee.

648
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,078
Could I have a little, Mrs. Pawley?

649
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:43,599
Looks like Mrs. Pawley's
gonna make you a fine, dutiful wife.

650
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,721
Oh, cut it out, will you?

651
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:53,363
Look...I sure wish
I could make you understand.

652
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:06,565
She says her name is
Wild Goose Flying in The Night Sky.

653
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:11,121
But she'll answer to ''Look,''
if that pleases you.

654
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,684
That's grounds for divorce in Texas!

655
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:50,249
You're really rough!

656
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:52,838
Well, I don't think it's a dead-bird funny!

657
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,963
Look, if you really wanna do some good,
why don't you ask her where Scar is?

658
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,763
She heard you.

659
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:13,524
You ask her!

660
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:19,329
Do you know where he went?
Did he have a girl with him? A white girl?

661
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,288
No, not a woman. It's--

662
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:30,845
Sister!

663
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:57,804
Look's gone!

664
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,522
Pulled out in the night.

665
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,602
She ain't goin' back to her family.
That's for certain.

666
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:09,204
She took off the way
that arrow is pointing.

667
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,289
Think maybe we ought to follow her?

668
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,884
How should I know? She's your wife.

669
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,480
<i>''Maybe she left other signs</i>
<i>for us to follow but...</i>

670
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:23,208
''...we'll never know...

671
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:26,322
''...because it snowed
that day and all the next week.''

672
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:33,005
<i>We were headin' north</i>
<i>through buffalo country...</i>

673
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:36,685
<i>...when somethin' happened that</i>
<i>I ain't got straight in my own mind yet.</i>

674
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:39,159
<i>On this day we sighted a small herd.</i>

675
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,765
<i>We needed meat, so we circled around...</i>

676
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,041
<i>...and came up on them on foot.</i>

677
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:20,919
That don't make no sense!

678
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,808
Hunger! Empty bellies! That's the sense!

679
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:37,762
At least they won't feed
any Comanches this winter!

680
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,119
Listen!

681
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,566
<i>It was the Nawyecky Comanches, all right.</i>

682
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:51,289
<i>The ones we'd been looking for</i>
<i>all this time.</i>

683
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,249
It's Look.

684
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:30,921
What did them soldiers have
to go and kill her for?

685
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:32,489
She never done nobody any harm.

686
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:35,289
We've got to catch up with them,
maybe they've got Debbie with them!

687
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,328
Maybe they've got that chief they call Scar.

688
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,724
<i>So, we figured Debbie'd been in the village.</i>

689
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,285
<i>What Look was doin' there...</i>
<i>whether she'd come to warn 'em...</i>

690
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:46,520
<i>...or maybe to find Debbie for me...</i>

691
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,687
<i>...there's no way of knowing.</i>

692
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:33,126
Come on, move along! Come on!

693
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:56,445
Yes?

694
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,964
We're looking for a girl.
A white girl. A captive.

695
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,927
Should be about 14 now.

696
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,445
Fourteen? We have two about that age.

697
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:07,208
-All the white women are in the chapel.
-What's this girl to you?

698
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:09,246
-She's my--
-She's my niece.

699
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,125
One moment.

700
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,921
-White women?
-Yes, sir.

701
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:43,803
Will you stand up?

702
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,003
Stand up, please.

703
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:10,446
It's hard to believe they're white.

704
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,688
They ain't white!

705
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:15,444
Not any more. They are Comanches!

706
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,288
Where are your casualties?

707
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,440
Maybe you can help us identify them.
All white. All captives.

708
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,607
There's the white girl there.

709
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:53,406
No.

710
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:01,124
''So we're setting out for New Mexico
territory in the morning.

711
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:07,079
''I am sorry I won't be back
for Christmas again this year.

712
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:15,925
''I set pencil aside and hope
you are enjoying good health.

713
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:17,722
''And your folks the same.

714
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:20,446
''I remain, respectfully...

715
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:23,926
''...yours truly, Martin Pawley.''

716
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,645
They'll never find that girl.

717
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,759
Never!

718
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,243
''Yours truly.''

719
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:47,404
He had to sign his whole name,
''Martin Pawley.''

720
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,446
He couldn't write just ''Marty''!

721
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,600
I don't care if he never comes back!

722
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:58,440
Charlie, you stay for supper.
I won't take ''no'' for an answer.

723
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:02,444
The thought of saying ''no''
never entered my head, Mrs. Jorgensen.

724
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:06,568
Ain't no place I'd rather be
than right here...

725
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:08,484
...right now.

726
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:12,840
''Gone again, skip to my Lou

727
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:17,640
''Gone again, skip to my Lou

728
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:22,600
''Gone again, skip to my Lou

729
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,360
''Skip to my Lou, my darling''

730
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,369
-Recognize it?
-That?

731
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,090
Couldn't be two like that
in the whole world!

732
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,759
Mose Harper!

733
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,286
Mose, you look shabbier than ever!

734
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:08,883
How about a drink?

735
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:14,128
Ain't been too good.
No, sir. Not too good.

736
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,999
-Getting old.
-You were born old.

737
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:20,721
Been helpin' you, Ethan.
Been lookin' all the time.

738
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,761
The reward still stands.

739
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,808
Don't want no money, Ethan.
No money, Marty.

740
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,239
Just a roof over old Mose's head.

741
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,719
And a rocking chair by the fire.

742
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,570
My own rocking chair by the fire, Marty.

743
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:42,802
You help us find the girl
and you've got your rocking chair.

744
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:44,767
Swear it, Ethan? Given word?

745
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,608
I told you, didn't I?

746
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:50,244
Ethan, I found a man who's seen her.

747
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:53,206
He knows where little Debbie is!

748
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,566
Where is he? Who is this man?

749
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,642
-Promise?
-Who is this man?

750
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,528
I am this man, <i>Seor</i>.

751
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:08,127
At your service. For a price.
Always for a price.

752
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:22,844
Sir, I'd like to--

753
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:24,761
Wait till you grow up.

754
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,727
Let's talk a little business.

755
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:55,725
Why not?

756
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:28,085
Let's go.

757
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:29,678
But I'm hungry!

758
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:31,289
While you're fillin' your belly...

759
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:34,248
...I'm goin' out to meet a Comanche
named Cicatriz.

760
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:35,843
Never heard of him.

761
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:38,679
''<i>Cicatriz</i>'' is Mexican for ''scar.''

762
01:18:58,370 --> 01:18:59,928
Medicine country, huh?

763
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,168
Bad medicine, I think.

764
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:28,367
-This is the great Cicatriz, War Chief.
-Scar, huh?

765
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:36,360
Plain to see how you got your name.

766
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:39,723
You, Big Shoulders.

767
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:43,080
The young one, He Who Follows.

768
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:48,002
You speak pretty good American
for a Comanche.

769
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,048
Did someone teach you?

770
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:02,286
That's right. We've come to trade.
Only not out here.

771
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:05,400
I don't stand talkin' in the wind.

772
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:33,049
You speak good Comanche.
Did someone teach you?

773
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,200
-You, stay out here.
-Not likely.

774
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:47,729
His sons are dead. So his wives sit
on the honor side of his lodge.

775
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,608
Are all those his wives?

776
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,445
Two sons killed by white men.

777
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,760
For each son, I take many....

778
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:05,279
Scalps.

779
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:40,242
We've seen scalps before.

780
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,883
Seen this before?

781
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:53,439
I came to trade,
not to admire his collection.

782
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:57,682
Tell him we'll pitch camp on the other
side of the creek and talk tomorrow.

783
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:14,928
It is not that I am afraid.

784
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:17,319
Don't apologize. You got well paid.

785
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:22,963
But he knows who you are,
and why you're here. This, I did not know.

786
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,724
Take it. I do not want blood money.

787
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:48,159
Do you think old Scar means to kill us?

788
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,449
He's got to.

789
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:53,519
We've been asking for it for five years.

790
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:57,879
Why didn't he make his move back there?

791
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:02,248
Hospitality, I guess. Comanche hospitality.

792
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:08,086
Why? Do you want to pull out too?

793
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:14,119
Big Shoulders!

794
01:23:31,850 --> 01:23:34,842
Debbie, don't you remember?
I'm Martin, your brother.

795
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:36,764
Remember?

796
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,842
Debbie, remember back....

797
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:44,088
Do you remember how I used
to let you ride my horse?

798
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:47,203
And tell you stories?

799
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:51,081
Don't you remember me, Debbie?

800
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:52,725
I remember.

801
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,164
For always.

802
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:59,762
First I prayed to you, to come and get me...

803
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:03,764
...to take me home. You didn't come.

804
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:07,768
I've come now, Debbie.

805
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,169
These are my people.

806
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,201
Go! Go, Martin! Please!

807
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:17,769
Stand aside, Martin!

808
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:23,323
No, you don't, Ethan!

809
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:25,768
Ethan! No, you don't!

810
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:29,079
Stand aside!

811
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:53,880
Looks as though I'm gonna have
to open that shoulder again.

812
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,362
To get the poison out.

813
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:00,680
Sure beats me, Ethan...
how you could've stayed alive this long.

814
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:02,729
Read this.

815
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:15,679
''I...

816
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:18,682
''...Ethan Edwards...

817
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:22,280
''...being of a sound mind...

818
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:25,885
''...and...

819
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:28,520
''...without any blood kin...

820
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,888
''...do hereby...''

821
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:42,520
Bequeath. It means ''leave.''

822
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,449
''...bequeath...

823
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:48,841
''...all my property...

824
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:52,842
''...of any kind...

825
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:57,722
''...to Martin Pawley.''

826
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:03,563
What do you mean,
you don't have any ''blood kin''?

827
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:05,728
Debbie is your blood kin!

828
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,448
Not no more, she ain't!

829
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:09,807
Well, you can keep your will!

830
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,360
I don't want any of your property!

831
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:15,926
Besides, I ain't forgettin' you was gettin'
all set to shoot her yourself.

832
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:17,409
What kind of man are you anyway?

833
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:20,527
-She's been livin' with a buck!
-Shut your dirty mouth!

834
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:28,689
I hope you die!

835
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:31,568
That'll be the day!

836
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:30,806
Good evening, everybody!

837
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:37,004
Here he is! All curried,
combed and washed behind the ears.

838
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:40,403
Charlie, you look right handsome!
I'd hardly know you.

839
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:43,368
Yes, ma'am.
I can't hardly recognize myself.

840
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,922
Get it on, Luther!

841
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:03,399
Why don't you have a drink?

842
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:06,288
Oh, no, Nesby.
Not till I'm finished my clergyin'.

843
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:08,680
Bar's closed. Right, Sister Jorgensen?

844
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,238
All right, let's go! Let's get it goin'!

845
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:23,804
Go ahead.

846
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:27,560
Bible.

847
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:32,761
-Get them spurs off!
-Yes, sir.

848
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:38,961
All right, line up inside, boys.

849
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:53,239
''Yes, we will gather at the river

850
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:00,518
''The beautiful, the beautiful river

851
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:08,244
''Gather with the saints at the river

852
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:15,159
''That flows by the throne of God''

853
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:31,404
Hey, you don't suppose they're
throwin' a party for us, do you?

854
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:33,128
That'll be the day!

855
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:40,164
I'm all right.

856
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:49,604
Ethan, Martin! You can't come in!
The rangers are in there.

857
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,238
What's that got to do with us?

858
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:53,605
You're both posted for murder.
The both of you!

859
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:55,999
That trader, the late Futterman....

860
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,004
The Reverend and the rangers
are in there now....

861
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:01,001
Well, what's goin' on anyway?

862
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:11,881
Looks like you two will have
a lot to talk about.

863
01:32:11,970 --> 01:32:14,325
-Come on, Lars.
-Ethan...hide in the barn!

864
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:15,445
What for?

865
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:23,321
Please! Look, everybody!

866
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:25,125
Look, Mama!

867
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,522
Look who's here!

868
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:30,559
Evenin'.

869
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:35,169
Is the bar open?

870
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,961
Any news of our little girl?

871
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:41,000
She's not a little girl anymore.

872
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,047
You've seen her? She's alive?

873
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:45,360
I've seen her and she's alive.

874
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:50,360
Good evening, Reverend.
Or should I call you ''Captain''?

875
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:53,206
I came here for a wedding, Ethan.

876
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:57,044
Till that's over, ''Reverend'' will do.
Afterwards we'll talk.

877
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:59,041
-Is Marty with you?
-Yep.

878
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:07,683
It's good to see you back, Ethan.
We'll join you.

879
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,841
But I wrote you one letter.

880
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:13,441
One letter in five years!

881
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:18,045
I read it till the paper dried up
and the writin' faded out.

882
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:22,647
It wasn't much of a letter, was it?

883
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:23,924
No, it wasn't.

884
01:33:25,530 --> 01:33:27,680
Might've at least said you loved me.

885
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:32,249
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that'd have been somethin'.

886
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:35,848
But I always loved you!

887
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:39,922
I thought you knew that
without me havin' to say it.

888
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:43,045
It isn't fair, Martin Pawley!

889
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:45,842
It isn't fair and you know it!

890
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:48,649
-I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
-Who's cryin'?

891
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:00,766
I reckon the best thing for me to do
is to go away.

892
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:05,524
You do, Martin Pawley, and I'll just die!

893
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:20,204
I'll thank you to unhand my fiance.

894
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:27,403
You don't mean you're
gonna be marryin' him?

895
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:31,209
She sure is!

896
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:35,160
And don't think your comin' back
is gonna change it either!

897
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:38,169
Well, now, as to that,
I just don't know, Charlie.

898
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,400
We hadn't gotten around
to talkin' about marriage.

899
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:43,766
What right have you to talk marriage
to any decent woman?

900
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:46,240
If you're referrin' to
that crazy murder charge--

901
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:47,683
And other things.

902
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:53,360
You think you're gettin' away with
bein' smart about the Indian wife you took.

903
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:58,798
I'll bet she ain't the first squaw you ever--

904
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:00,562
Why, you are a no good--

905
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:04,960
Oh, Marty, you've done it again!

906
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,569
Get out of my way!

907
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:12,598
Marty! Charlie! I ain't gonna have
no fightin' in my house.

908
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:15,648
Well, then we're just gonna fight outside,
doggone it!

909
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:17,322
I ain't totin' no firearms.

910
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:19,844
Well, that sure ain't gonna be no problem.

911
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:23,805
-After you, Marty.
-After you, Charlie.

912
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:32,125
Look, here.

913
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:36,639
Thank you.

914
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:47,040
Spit over that piece of firewood.

915
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:06,518
Quit that, Marty! That ain't fair!

916
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:17,401
Marty, now you stop that!

917
01:36:26,610 --> 01:36:29,408
Is this here altercation in the line of duty?

918
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:32,800
No, sir. It's more in the nature
of a private fight.

919
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:36,883
All right, then, go ahead.
But fight fair. No biting or gouging!

920
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:39,488
And no kicking either!

921
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,286
Get them up! Make them fight fair!

922
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:44,849
Now you fight fair, Martin!

923
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:46,363
Wait a minute!

924
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:48,449
Somebody's fiddle.

925
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:54,126
No choking! No gouging!

926
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:58,042
Mr. Edwards, make 'em stop!

927
01:36:58,130 --> 01:36:59,643
Why? You started it.

928
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:02,161
Marty, watch his feet!

929
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:07,361
Don't forget, you're a lady.

930
01:37:24,010 --> 01:37:25,523
Come on, Charlie. Get up!

931
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:27,282
Are you all right?

932
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,719
I reckon so.

933
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:33,846
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

934
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:37,240
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

935
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:41,087
It don't hurt none, Charlie.

936
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:44,966
Now you boys get cleaned up
and we'll proceed with the wedding.

937
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:46,161
Where's my Bible?

938
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:48,480
There ain't gonna be no wedding.

939
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:59,401
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

940
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:09,240
It was a nice wedding party,
considering nobody got married.

941
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:15,324
Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin
to take a ride with me...

942
01:38:15,410 --> 01:38:17,287
...down to the state capital.

943
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:20,649
Is this an invite
to a necktie party, Reverend?

944
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:23,247
No, I wouldn't say that.

945
01:38:24,010 --> 01:38:26,808
Likely you had your reasons
for killin' Futterman.

946
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:29,328
Probably needed killin'.

947
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,280
I'm talking to you now as a ranger,
not as a preacher.

948
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:37,243
The fact that all three of 'em
was shot in the back was...

949
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:39,844
...the only thing
that raised some questions.

950
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:41,809
That, and...

951
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:45,766
...a missin' gold piece that was
known to have been on him...

952
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:48,641
...just prior to his demise.

953
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:53,124
Ethan, I'll have to ask you for your gun.

954
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:08,364
Well, if it's all the same to you, Reverend...

955
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:10,409
...I ain't goin' to Austin!

956
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:12,640
You're goin' if the captain says so.

957
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:14,484
Stop it! Stop it!

958
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:17,642
I'll put both of you boys
in the smokehouse to cool off.

959
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:22,725
Good evening, ma'am. Captain Clayton?

960
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:25,563
Excuse me, ma'am.

961
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:28,806
-Captain Clayton, sir?
-No.

962
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:32,122
I'm Captain Clayton.

963
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:35,128
-You're Captain Clayton?
-Yes, I'm Captain Clayton.

964
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:37,724
Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.
The colonel wants to know--

965
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:39,801
-Is your head cold?
-No, sir.

966
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:42,403
I'm sorry, sir.

967
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:46,884
-All right, start at the beginning.
-Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.

968
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:49,683
Hold on, son. Who is this Col. Greenhill
you're talking about?

969
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:51,647
Why, Col. Greenhill is Col. Greenhill, sir.

970
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:53,527
-Commanding officer of the 15th--
-And who are you?

971
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:55,248
I'm Lt. Greenhill, sir.

972
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:57,400
What is it your pa wants to know?

973
01:39:58,210 --> 01:39:59,438
Well, go ahead.

974
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:02,126
My pa wants to know....
Col. Greenhill wants to know...

975
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:05,361
-...how soon you can put a company--
-Turn around, sonny.

976
01:40:06,410 --> 01:40:08,685
Yeah, he's a Yankee cavalryman.

977
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:13,244
Col. Greenhill wants to know how soon
you could.... I resent that, sir!

978
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:15,321
Just funnin', son, just funnin'.

979
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:18,518
How soon you could put a company
of your men in the field...

980
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:20,601
...fully armed for joint-punitive action
against the Comanches?

981
01:40:20,690 --> 01:40:22,920
-Joint what?
-Joint-punitive action.

982
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:27,119
We received information about a band
of Comanches under a chief named Scar.

983
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:28,563
What information?

984
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:30,727
That maybe he's not far from here,
holed up somewhere.

985
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:32,562
What makes you think
he's not far from here?

986
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:34,402
One of our patrollers picked up a man...

987
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:36,720
...claims he was a prisoner with Scar
till two days ago.

988
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:39,005
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

989
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:42,048
Says he lives here.
Keeps mentioning a rocking chair.

990
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:49,044
Take his arms.

991
01:40:52,330 --> 01:40:53,399
It's Mose!

992
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:57,241
Good evening, ma'am.
I came for my rocking chair.

993
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:59,800
-Bring him to the fire.
-Watch him!

994
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:02,959
Get him up!

995
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:05,801
Here, get him a chair.

996
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:08,322
Bring him a drink!

997
01:41:09,490 --> 01:41:10,718
Watch his head!

998
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:15,124
-Take a drink, Mose.
-Drink that down, Mose.

999
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:21,246
Mose. Scar...where is he?

1000
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:25,526
My rocking chair.
You promised me my rocking chair.

1001
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:29,409
Ask him about Debbie.
Is Debbie all right, Mose?

1002
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,922
Made out I was crazy.

1003
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:38,999
You don't think I'm crazy, do you, ma'am?

1004
01:41:39,090 --> 01:41:41,320
No, Mose, you're just sick and hurt.

1005
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:42,639
Thank you, ma'am.

1006
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:45,642
Mose, try and remember.
You were at Scar's camp.

1007
01:41:46,130 --> 01:41:49,088
I ate dirt and chewed grass. I fooled them.

1008
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:50,882
Where is Scar holed up?

1009
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:52,689
I won't tell you.

1010
01:41:54,610 --> 01:41:56,202
I'll tell Marty.

1011
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:58,407
Seven Fingers, Marty.

1012
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:02,639
That's enough, Ethan.
Let's get him to bed.

1013
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:05,198
-Seven Fingers?
-Beg to report, sir...

1014
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:09,125
...that's what he told us,
but there's no such place on the maps.

1015
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:15,083
Isn't it the Caddo name for where
all them canyons join under the Malapai?

1016
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:17,481
Seven Fingers of Brazos!

1017
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:21,439
My rocking chair?

1018
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:22,758
We'll bring it.

1019
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:27,005
You go tell your pa that
a company of rangers...

1020
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:29,206
...all 14 of 'em, fully armed and equipped...

1021
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:30,962
...will be in the field by daylight.

1022
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:33,359
We'll be headin' for the south end
of the Malapai.

1023
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:36,044
If he can catch up with us,
all well and good!

1024
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:40,205
We can't take the field tomorrow.
For your own protection.

1025
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:43,923
Sonny. Out yonder is a pack
of murderers...

1026
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:47,247
...complete with Texican scalps
and a white-girl captive!

1027
01:42:47,330 --> 01:42:50,163
If you want to protect us,
just keep out of our way.

1028
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,320
Now you skedaddle back to your pa!

1029
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:56,839
You and Martin are hereby appointed
civilian scouts. Without pay.

1030
01:42:57,090 --> 01:43:00,685
Take the boys and get back
to headquarters and pick up my company.

1031
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,520
You're not going! Not this time.

1032
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:14,884
Are you crazy?

1033
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:17,963
It's too late. She is a woman grown now.

1034
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:21,124
I gotta go, Laurie. I gotta fetch her home.

1035
01:43:21,210 --> 01:43:22,563
Fetch what?

1036
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:26,559
The leavings of Comanche bucks sold time
and again to the highest bidder with--

1037
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:27,969
Laurie, shut your mouth!

1038
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:30,518
Do you know what Ethan
will do if he has a chance?

1039
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:32,601
He'll put a bullet in her brain!

1040
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:35,480
I tell you, Martha would want him to!

1041
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:37,329
Only if I'm dead!

1042
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:26,445
We can get within 200 yards of them.

1043
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:29,365
There's a hub back off to the left.

1044
01:44:30,450 --> 01:44:31,929
How many, you figure?

1045
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:34,408
About a dozen each.

1046
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:36,489
Enough to go around.

1047
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:46,728
Well, we found 'em!

1048
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:49,645
Now, men...

1049
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:53,804
...the state of Texas is paying you
12 Yankee dollars a month.

1050
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:57,281
Now is your chance to earn it!

1051
01:44:57,530 --> 01:45:00,840
Tighten up your cinches.
We'll go chargin' in about sunup.

1052
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:04,129
-Now make sure that--
-Just a minute, Reverend!

1053
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:12,563
If we go charging in, they'll kill her!
And you know it.

1054
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:15,244
-That's what I'm countin' on.
-I know you are.

1055
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:18,363
Well, it ain't gonna be that way!
She's alive and she's gonna stay alive!

1056
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:20,042
Living with Comanches ain't bein' alive.

1057
01:45:20,130 --> 01:45:23,202
It's better she's alive and livin' with
Comanches than her brains bashed out!

1058
01:45:23,290 --> 01:45:26,043
Now, son, I know
this is a bitter thing to say...

1059
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:28,525
...but there's more at stake here
than your sister.

1060
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:31,249
There sure is.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

1061
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:35,121
I didn't mean to speak of it,
but I'm gonna tell you now.

1062
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:39,005
You remember that scalp strung
on Scar's lance? Long and wavy?

1063
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:42,567
Yeah, I saw it. And don't try to tell me
it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's!

1064
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:44,208
It was your mother's.

1065
01:45:48,570 --> 01:45:51,687
That don't change it.
That don't change nothing!

1066
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:58,360
Give me a chance to sneak in and
get her out, before you come chargin' in.

1067
01:45:58,450 --> 01:45:59,439
What if you get caught?

1068
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:02,727
-That don't tell them nothin', does it?
-I said no!

1069
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:08,246
You go right ahead, son. But at the first
sign of an alarm, we're comin' in.

1070
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:13,598
We ain't gonna have no time to pick
and choose our targets when we do!

1071
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:17,689
It's your funeral.

1072
01:47:21,370 --> 01:47:22,689
Captain Clayton!

1073
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:25,569
Captain Clayton!

1074
01:47:25,930 --> 01:47:27,443
What the Sam Hill...?

1075
01:47:32,690 --> 01:47:36,399
Go ahead! Why don't you have
your bugler blow the charge too?

1076
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:41,008
Oh, never mind.
Does your pa know you're out here?

1077
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,639
Yes, sir. The troops are 10 miles back.

1078
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:45,528
The colonel sent me to find you.

1079
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:48,204
You found me. Good work and goodbye.

1080
01:47:48,610 --> 01:47:50,282
Is there anything I can do, sir?

1081
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,485
God forbid.

1082
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:55,449
You just go back and tell your pa
where we are and where he is.

1083
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:58,444
But he knows that, sir. Can't I stay?

1084
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:00,639
Please?

1085
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:04,329
Oh, all right. But you watch me, boy.

1086
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:08,529
I'm the hard case you're up against
out here, not them childish savages.

1087
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:11,045
If you don't hear my first holler...

1088
01:48:11,290 --> 01:48:12,609
...you better read my mind...

1089
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:16,365
...'cause I don't aim to raise no two hollers
on any subject at hand!

1090
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:18,088
-Yes, sir.
-Boy...

1091
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:20,449
...watch that knife!

1092
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:21,765
Sorry, sir.

1093
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:41,999
Halt!

1094
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:44,879
Mount!

1095
01:48:49,570 --> 01:48:50,719
Mount!

1096
01:49:24,410 --> 01:49:25,638
Don't say anything!

1097
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:27,368
It's your brother Marty!

1098
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:31,006
I'm gonna take you away.
I'm gonna get you out of here, Debbie.

1099
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:33,005
Yes, Marty!

1100
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:43,486
Brethren, let us go amongst them!

1101
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:24,325
Charlie, Nesby, run off that pony herd--

1102
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:27,080
Boy, you watch out for that knife!

1103
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:28,444
Let's go!

1104
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:02,639
No, Ethan!

1105
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:27,959
No, Ethan!

1106
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:42,488
Let's go home, Debbie.

1107
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:53,566
-Does that hurt, Reverend?
-Shut up!

1108
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:10,046
Good work, Captain! Good work, Son.

1109
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:12,249
You wounded?

1110
01:52:13,050 --> 01:52:15,041
-A bullet? An arrow?
-No!
