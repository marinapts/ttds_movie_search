1
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,220
And they're off and running!

2
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,258
Seattle breaking on top.
Purple shadow is second.

3
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,029
At exactly 3:45
on that Saturday afternoon...

4
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,036
In the last week of September...

5
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,699
Marvin Unger was perhaps the only one
among the 100,000 people at the track...

6
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,606
Who felt no thrill
at the running of the sixth race.

7
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,941
He was totally disinterested
in horse racing...

8
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,277
And held a lifelong contempt
for gambling.

9
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:21,513
Nevertheless, he had a five-dollar win
bet on every horse in the fifth race.

10
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,111
He knew, of course, that this
rather unique system of betting...

11
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,681
Would more than likely result
in a loss, but he didn't care.

12
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,990
For after all, he thought, what would
the loss of $20 or $30 mean...

13
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,554
In comparison to the vast sum
of money ultimately at stake?

14
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,228
- A bottle of ginger ale, please.
- Yes, sir. Comin' right up.

15
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,071
Favorite broke bad.
Could be anybody's race.

16
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,168
Could be.

17
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:51,272
A five-dollar win
next to the five-dollar place.

18
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,250
- Quite a crowd you got.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,019
Passing the quarter pole,
it is lucky arrow and purple shadow...

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,892
With stopwatch
on the outside to third.

21
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,694
At the head of the stretch,
it is purple shadow leading by a length.

22
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,258
Lucky arrow is second,
behind by a quarter.

23
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,862
Stopwatch moving up on the outside
by a length and a quarter.

24
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,704
Then comes southern star,
baynard brit, Stanley eight...

25
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,801
Third row and lovely dilemma.

26
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,642
It is lucky arrow leading by a head.

27
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,514
Purple shadow by a header and
stopwatch moving fast on the outside.

28
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,850
It's lucky arrow, purple shadow,
stopwatch neck and neck.

29
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,480
It's lucky arrow, purple shadow
and stopwatch.

30
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,823
It's stopwatch taking the lead.

31
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,760
It's stopwatch by a head.

32
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,561
Purple shadow second by a head,
lucky arrow third by a length...

33
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,694
And southern star finished fourth.

34
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,618
Waiting for the race
to become official...

35
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,628
He began to feel
as if he had as much effect...

36
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,789
On the final outcome
of the operation...

37
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,356
As a single piece
a jumbo Jigsaw puzzle has...

38
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,561
To its predetermined final design.

39
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,037
Only the addition of
the missing fragments of the puzzle...

40
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,940
Would reveal whether the picture was
as he guessed it would be.

41
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,240
The result of the sixth race
is now declared to open.

42
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,497
Twenty-five dollars.

43
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,240
About an hour earlier that same
Saturday afternoon in September...

44
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,243
In another part of the city...

45
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,176
Patrolman first class Randy Kennon...

46
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,908
Had some personal business
to attend to.

47
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,348
Hiya, Tony. What's the good word?

48
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,784
Same as always... havin' a ball.

49
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,616
See you later.

50
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,791
Good evening, Randy.
How have things been?

51
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,525
What's the use of kickin', Leo?
You wouldn't believe it, anyway.

52
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,864
I suppose that we're very well.

53
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:28,462
After all, a man drives a new car,
lives in a fine apartment.

54
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,532
So I like to live good.
You got any objections?

55
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,599
None at all...

56
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,442
As long as you don't overlook
your obligation to me.

57
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,778
I trust it was purely an oversight.

58
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,513
I'm sure a man in your position
wouldn't deliberately antagonize...

59
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,111
His creditors.

60
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,783
I ain't got it.
I know I should have it.

61
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,384
I'm as anxious to pay you off as you
are to have me, but I ain't got it.

62
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,796
Well, we all get a little cramped
now and then.

63
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,802
Suppose we make it a thousand.
I'll rewrite the balance as a new loan.

64
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,735
Give you a fresh start.

65
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,899
Listen. I'm broke. Get me?
Flat broke.

66
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,911
I couldn't give you 1,000 cents,
but if you can wait a couple of weeks...

67
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,676
Might be arranged,
with the proper collateral, of course.

68
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,514
You mean, where's the dough
comin' from? I can't tell you.

69
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,920
All I can tell you is, it's a sweet deal
and I'll be able to pay off.

70
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,720
- In two weeks? No longer?
- Maybe even less than that.

71
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:27,390
You know I wouldn't pull a thing
like this on you. I couldn't afford to.

72
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,096
I'm glad you said that.

73
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,136
I was going to point out as much...

74
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,671
But since you relieved me
of the unpleasant necessity...

75
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,436
It's a deal then? I pay you the 2,600
within the next two weeks.

76
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:42,913
Plus $400, a total of 3,000.
The extra interest, of course.

77
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,381
I trust that'll be satisfactory.

78
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,883
I couldn't say no.

79
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,113
Thank you.
I was sure you'd see it my way.

80
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,848
Take good care of yourself.

81
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,291
I'll take care of myself, mister.

82
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,420
That's my specialty.

83
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,862
At 7:00 p.M. That same day...

84
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,493
Johnny Clay, perhaps the most important
thread in the unfinished fabric...

85
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,559
Furthered its design.

86
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,232
None of these men are criminals
in the usual sense.

87
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,899
They've all got jobs.

88
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,308
They all live seemingly normal,
decent lives, but...

89
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,076
They got their problems, and they've
all got a little larceny in 'em.

90
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:21,675
You take my pal Unger, for instance,
the guy who owns this apartment...

91
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,712
He's putting up the money to operate
with him and he's letting me stay here.

92
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,689
He's a bookkeeper.

93
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,421
Been with the same company
for ten years.

94
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,192
You know, fay, the biggest mistake
I made before was shooting for peanuts.

95
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,427
Five years have taught me one thing,
if nothing else:

96
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,198
Anytime you take a chance, you better be
sure the rewards are worth the risk.

97
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,934
They can put you away just as fast for
a $10 heist as for a million-dollar job.

98
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,533
You don't have to sell it
to me, Johnny.

99
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,045
You know I'll go along
with anything you say.

100
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,275
I always have, you know,
ever since we were kids.

101
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,376
I've always believed you,
everything you've ever told me.

102
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,589
Those five years you been away...

103
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,955
I know they must've been
terrible for you.

104
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:06,963
I mean, being locked up
must be a terrible thing.

105
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,230
You know something?

106
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,065
This may sound funny, but...

107
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,663
Waiting for you all those years
and staying by myself...

108
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,675
It was like...

109
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:22,338
Not that you were locked in,
but I was locked out.

110
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,173
Well, look at me.

111
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,082
First time we've been together
in five years, and I'm making speeches.

112
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,747
Now, now. Everything is gonna be
all right, I promise you.

113
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,916
Make sure you're right about it.

114
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,926
I'm no good for anybody else.

115
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:40,829
I'm not pretty and not very smart,
so please don't leave me alone any more.

116
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,993
Now, nothing is going to happen,
not this time.

117
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,197
I guess I better leave you be now.

118
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,208
I know you've got a lot of work to do.

119
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,006
- When will I see you again?
- Saturday night.

120
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,707
We'll be on the plane together.

121
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,944
Until it's over, I want you
to stay out of the way.

122
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:05,387
- If there's anything I can do to help.
- No. Just make the plane reservations.

123
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,446
Remember, tell them at the office
that you're leaving.

124
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,390
Tell them you're getting married.

125
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,019
I don't want to say good-bye.

126
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,659
- We were just talking about you.
- Hi, Johnny. Hi, miss fay.

127
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,726
- Hello.
- I hope it was something nice.

128
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,468
Yes. Johnny was telling me
about what a wonderful friend you were.

129
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,739
- Fay was just leaving.
- Don't rush off on my account.

130
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,542
- She's late for an appointment.
- That's right.

131
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,676
- You be sure to call me.
- I'll do just what I told you I would.

132
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,915
It was nice to see you again, Mr. Unger.
Take care of Johnny.

133
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,359
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for Johnny.

134
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,090
I'll see you.

135
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,859
A half an hour earlier
at approximately 6:30...

136
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,426
Mike O'Reilly,
the track bartender, came home.

137
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,369
Ruthie, I'm home.

138
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,468
At 7:15 that same night...

139
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,036
George peatty, the track cashier,
arrived at his apartment.

140
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,852
- Feeling okay?
- Fine.

141
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,089
I've been kind of sick today.
I keep getting pains in my stomach.

142
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,099
Maybe you got a hole in it, George.
Do you suppose you have?

143
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,761
How would I get a hole
in my stomach?

144
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,862
How would you get one in your head?
Fix me a drink.

145
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,703
I think I'm developing
some pains myself.

146
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,644
Sherry, can't I ever say anything at all
without you joking me about it?

147
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:12,308
Hurry up with that drink.
The pains are gettin' worse.

148
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,720
I saw somethin' kind of nice
comin' home on the train tonight.

149
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,279
Somethin', well, kind of sweet.

150
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,450
A candy bar, George?

151
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,926
No, not a candy bar, darn it.

152
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,394
It was people.

153
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,736
This couple sittin'
just in front of me.

154
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,205
They weren't young exactly.
I guess the woman was about your age.

155
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,506
A little senile, you mean, with
one foot and a big toe in the grave?

156
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,944
You want to hear this or not?

157
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,074
I can't wait.
Go ahead and thrill me.

158
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,813
Anyway, they were sittin' in front of me
and I could hear what they were sayin'.

159
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,513
Well, part of it.

160
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,956
- They weren't young exactly...
- She was about my age, you said.

161
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:59,053
Not any more. Maybe she was when you
started telling this story, but not now.

162
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,224
Anyway, she was calling him papa,
and he was calling her mama.

163
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:06,896
The climax to this exciting story?
The moral, the punch line?

164
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,339
Forget it. I just thought I'd tell you
about it, but I might've known.

165
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,537
I know. You want to bet I know?
I'll give you seven to five.

166
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,739
Cut it out, will you?

167
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,907
I'm tired.
I don't feel so good.

168
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,386
You want me to call you papa,
and you want to call me mama?

169
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,444
- You know all the answers.
- Go right ahead.

170
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,355
It may be the last word you ever say,
but I'll try to kill you as painlessly...

171
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,623
I gotta go out tonight. I don't suppose
there's anything for dinner.

172
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,688
Of course there is.
There are all sorts of things.

173
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,167
- We have steak, asparagus and potatoes.
- I don't smell nothin'.

174
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,727
That figures, 'cause you're
too far away from it.

175
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,569
- Too far away?
- You don't think I had it all cooked.

176
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,633
It's all down in the shopping center.

177
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,940
Tell me somethin',
would you, Sherry?

178
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,504
Just tell me one thing.

179
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,948
Why did you ever marry me, anyway?

180
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:58,512
When a man has to ask his wife that,
well, he just hadn't better.

181
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,115
Why talk about it? Maybe it's
all to the good in the long run.

182
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,127
After all, if people
didn't have headaches...

183
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,129
What would happen
to the aspirin industry?

184
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,461
You used to love me.
You said you did, anyway.

185
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,127
I seem to recall you made
a memorable statement too...

186
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,694
Something about hitting it rich and
having an apartment on park avenue...

187
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,468
And a different car
for every day of the week.

188
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,033
Not that I really care
about such things...

189
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,705
As long as I have a big, handsome,
intelligent brute like you.

190
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,215
It would make a difference, wouldn't it?
If I had money, I mean.

191
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,218
How would you define "money"?

192
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,720
If you're thinking of giving me
your collection of Roosevelt dimes...

193
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,848
I mean, big money...
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

194
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,122
You really don't feel well. Are you
sure that pain's in your stomach?

195
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,789
I'm gonna have it...
Hundreds of thousands.

196
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,059
Maybe a half a million.

197
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,068
Of course you are. Did you put
the right address on the envelope...

198
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,070
When you sent it to the north pole?

199
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,629
Go ahead and laugh. Wait and see.

200
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,302
Maybe you won't be laughing so hard
in a few days.

201
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,710
You're serious. You really think
you're gonna have a lot of money.

202
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,942
I don't think nothin'. I know it.

203
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,918
You've never been a liar. You don't
have enough imagination to lie.

204
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,752
What makes you think you're gonna have
several hundred thousand dollars?

205
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,726
- 'Cause I do. I can't talk about it.
- Not even to me, your little Sherry?

206
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,763
I shouldn't even have mentioned
I was going to have it.

207
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,095
It's not that I mind. I know I can
trust you, but if these other guys...

208
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,828
"These other guys"?

209
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,131
I can't talk about it, Sherry.

210
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,107
Is that why you're going out tonight?
To meet with them?

211
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,736
They got nothin' to do with that.
I just got to go uptown for a while.

212
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,337
I see.
Well, you go right ahead.

213
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,349
If you want to act that way,
I certainly won't try to stop you.

214
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,352
Now, Sherry, honey,
don't be sore at me.

215
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:40,254
When a woman's been married five years
and her husband doesn't trust her...

216
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,918
You think more of them
than you do of me.

217
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,485
What right have you got
to say a thing like that?

218
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,055
You know I'm crazy about you.
I'd do anything in the world for you.

219
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,897
You're the one I'm doing it for.
If I didn't love you so much...

220
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,733
I don't want you to do
anything for me.

221
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,898
Go up and see your fellow...
Whatever you want to do.

222
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:02,202
Don't you be surprised
if I'm not here when you get home.

223
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,647
You better be here.
You hear me? You will be, won't you?

224
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,583
You wouldn't do anything foolish,
would you?

225
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,417
I certainly wouldn't want to,
but as long as you don't trust me...

226
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,753
Or have the slightest bit
of faith in me...

227
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:17,487
- If I ever found you with another man...
- You have no use for me.

228
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,530
You say you do, but when it comes
to a showdown, or proving it...

229
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,533
You say one thing
and then you do the opposite.

230
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,099
Well, I could tell you a little bit
about it, I guess...

231
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,868
Or most of it.

232
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,309
- But you got to promise to keep quiet.
- Why, of course, Darling.

233
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,338
Just a second.

234
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,281
- Well!
- Hello.

235
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,852
- How'd you get away from George tonight?
- He had to go somewhere.

236
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,222
That's a break.
I'm glad you called me.

237
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,692
Somethin' wrong, baby?

238
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,959
No, nothing's wrong.

239
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,969
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't think so.

240
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,234
Come on, now.
That's not my baby.

241
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,003
- Val, I called you last night.
- Yeah?

242
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,568
- There was no answer.
- I guess I stepped out.

243
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,081
- I called you four times.
- I guess I was out somewhere.

244
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,174
Oh? What'd you do?

245
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,516
I guess I was goofin' off
at a movie or somethin'.

246
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,852
Why are you doing this to me?

247
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,121
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

248
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,492
Oh, look, Mrs. peatty...

249
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,827
What I do is my own business.

250
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,832
I never tried to pin you down.

251
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,664
I never asked you how you
got your kicks before you met me.

252
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,331
That hurt. You didn't used
to talk to me like that.

253
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,171
I'm sorry, baby. But don't bug me.
I gotta live my life a certain way.

254
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,905
I can't stand it
when the walls start closin' in.

255
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:46,143
- But you know how crazy I am about you.
- And I'm crazy about you too.

256
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,981
I've given you
sufficient proof of that.

257
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,647
It's just that lately
every time I call...

258
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,486
So I step out once in a while.
You got yourself a husband.

259
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,992
The guy'ii spend
every last nickel on you.

260
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,655
He won't ask you any questions when you
come home from an afternoon movie...

261
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,425
At 9:00 at night.

262
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,331
- Don't be greedy.
- I'm not greedy. I'm in love with you.

263
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,496
If that's being greedy,
then I'm the biggest glutton on earth.

264
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,665
Don't make it sound so ominous. You
sound like you're gonna eat me alive.

265
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,504
I might just do that.

266
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,745
Darling, what are the two things in life
you're most interested in?

267
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,682
- What?
- Money and women?

268
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,845
That's a nice way to put me down.

269
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,118
- That about sums it up, doesn't it?
- We'll let it stand.

270
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,558
But I imagine what you really meant
to say was "money and woman."

271
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,723
We're gonna have money, more money than
you've dreamed of... maybe even millions.

272
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,461
- Yeah? How?
- George, that's how.

273
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,503
He's stumbled onto somethin' big.

274
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,368
- That meatball?
- Meatball with gravy, val.

275
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,430
You know he works at the track.

276
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,705
Somehow... and don't ask me how...
He's got connected with the mob.

277
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:51,111
They're gonna rob the track offices
for the day's receipts.

278
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,708
He seriously told you he and some mob
are gonna knock over the racetrack?

279
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,380
You can believe him, 'cause George
may be a fool, but he's not a liar.

280
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,981
The guy's crazy.
That's never been done before.

281
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,892
I told him that, but he says the job's
all set up and it's gonna be done.

282
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,830
And if I just sit tight, I'd be
up to my curls in cash just like that.

283
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,662
Let's suppose this is all true.
How do I fit in?

284
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:18,503
Well, you know I'm gonna leave George.
I guess you know why too.

285
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,909
You've been sayin' that
for a long, long time.

286
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,979
Everything's changed now.
I was gonna tell him tonight.

287
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,348
George may be very rich very soon.

288
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,353
That's all he needs, isn't it?

289
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,411
He'd still be George.

290
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,425
So you think... let's say,
George and his boys...

291
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,462
Pull this job
and George gets his cut...

292
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,225
Maybe I could take it
away from him, huh?

293
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,095
I think you could.

294
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,126
What about the others?
Any idea who they are?

295
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,298
Only this. I went through his clothes
while he was showering.

296
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,309
I'm quite sure
George went there tonight.

297
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,246
Kiddo, I think we got somethin' here.

298
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,546
If this is true, this is
a lot bigger than you think.

299
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,315
You're interested in takin'
Georgie's cut? I got news for you.

300
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,380
Georgie's cut's gonna be peanuts
compared to this whole thing.

301
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,222
We gotta find out more
about the overall plan.

302
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,455
- You think he'll tell you any more?
- Not a chance.

303
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,761
I could see he was scared
'cause he talked as much as he did.

304
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,995
I don't get it, Johnny,
about these two other guys.

305
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:25,538
There's gonna be two other guys,
and we ain't gonna know who they are?

306
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,771
That's right. You don't know who they
are, and they don't know who you are.

307
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,781
- That makes sense, doesn't it?
- I guess so, but...

308
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,942
Makes sense to me, all right.

309
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,008
What are they gonna do?

310
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,020
One of them's for
the job with the rifle.

311
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,522
None of you boys can handle that,
even if you were willing to.

312
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,525
The other one starts the fight
in the bar.

313
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,358
These other fellows, how much they
cuttin' in for. Not that I mind?

314
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,728
These men are not gonna be in
on the basic scheme.

315
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,892
They're getting paid to perform
certain definite duties...

316
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,199
At a certain definite time,
and they're not cutting in on the take.

317
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,637
They'll be paid a flat price
to do a straight job.

318
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:00,199
If they don't know anything about
the basic plan, why are they doin' it?

319
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,973
Simple. These boys are straight hoods.
They get paid in advance...

320
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,379
Five grand for the one with the rifle,
2,500 for the other.

321
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,907
- Where's this money comin' from?
- That's where Marvin comes in.

322
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,353
He's getting the 7,500 for us,
and he gets it back off the top.

323
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,391
I wish I could do more.

324
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,120
It's almost not right for me
to get as much as everybody else.

325
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,288
- After all, all I do is...
- Your money counts for plenty.

326
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:24,494
- You don't hear any of them complaining.
- You're okay in our book, marv.

327
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,230
But if these two hoods
get paid in advance...

328
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,329
How do you know
they're gonna do their jobs?

329
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll vouch for 'em.
These guys are pros.

330
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,978
They can't afford to weasel out.
If they did, they'd be washed up.

331
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,980
Any other questions?

332
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,877
Let's take a look at this, then.

333
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,218
This is a rough drawing of the track
as I remember it.

334
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,851
Randy, you'll have to get me
an a-1 street map of the whole district.

335
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,159
George, Mike, I want you to go over
this thing with me inch by inch.

336
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,428
Bring it completely up to date.
Add or subtract the slightest change...

337
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,095
Even if it's somethin' as small
as the placing of a hot dog stand.

338
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,866
Now, give or take a few thousand...

339
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,035
I figure the loot on this deal
at two million.

340
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,879
There should be that much
in the track offices.

341
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,212
That includes profits
on the pari-mutuel betting...

342
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,253
The breakage money,
taxes from the mutuel machines...

343
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,721
Receipts from the concessions
and the money from ticket sales.

344
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,883
None of this money
is allowed to accumulate...

345
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,893
At any one point around the track.

346
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,555
Except for money to make change with
and the mutuel clerks' payoff money...

347
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,620
It all goes into the office.

348
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,463
Out of the entire take,
only a few thousand dollars...

349
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,003
Is put in the office safe
to cover emergencies.

350
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,472
The rest is out in the open,
held for pickup by armored car.

351
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,475
That car arrives about 5:00...

352
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,569
And parks directly in front
of the entrance to the clubhouse.

353
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,081
Two men stay in it... one at the wheel,
the other at a machine gun.

354
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,414
Two others enter the office
to collect the dough.

355
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,749
They're armed, and so are
the track detectives who cover them...

356
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,550
From the car to the office and back.

357
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,751
Once the armored car arrives,
a stickup is...

358
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,928
Is out of the question.

359
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:28,454
What in the name of Pete would a babe
be doin' outside the door?

360
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,891
What do you think?

361
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,452
Any of you
ever see this woman before?

362
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,895
It's Sherry, my wife.

363
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,832
Why, you, you been talkin'.
You spilled to her.

364
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,563
I did not.
What, do you think I'm crazy?

365
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,229
You jerk. You clown!

366
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,570
Come on, clown.
Sing us a chorus from "pagliacci."

367
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,803
You better talk. Come clean.
Talk, or we'll get it out of her.

368
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,403
You wouldn't do anything
to hurt her, Johnny, please.

369
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,574
I don't want to, but if you
won't tell us what you told her...

370
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,244
I didn't tell her nothin'.
Why would I do a thing like that?

371
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,151
Sure, she wouldn't.

372
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,985
She's just the building inspector.

373
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,753
She just stopped outside that door
to measure the keyhole.

374
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,454
Let's have it, George.
We're gonna get it outta one of you.

375
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,465
If you didn't tell her,
then why was she around here snoopin'?

376
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,866
She must've found the address
in my pocket. That's what it was.

377
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:16,531
Thought I was two-timin' her,
runnin' around with another...

378
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:20,236
Of course.
She's just checkin' up on me.

379
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,480
I didn't tell her nothin', honest.

380
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,348
You'll let her go, won't you?

381
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,287
- You won't hurt her?
- Randy, Mike.

382
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,756
Take him to his apartment.
Stick with him until I phone you.

383
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,953
- I'm not leavin' Sherry here.
- You're leavin', all right.

384
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,793
- How are you goin'? Slidin' or walkin'?
- Come on. Let's go.

385
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,733
What are you gonna do now?

386
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,407
I don't think
I'll have to kill her...

387
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,637
Just slap that face
into hamburger meat.

388
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,910
Why don't you take a walk
for an hour or so.

389
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,414
Yeah.

390
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,348
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

391
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:47,227
All right, sister. That's a mighty
pretty head you got on your shoulders.

392
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,164
You want to keep it there, or do you
want to carry it around in your hands?

393
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,862
Maybe we could compromise
and put it on your shoulder.

394
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,369
I think that'd be nice.

395
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:58,169
- What were you doing outside that door?
- Doing? I was listening, naturally.

396
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,005
Trying to, I should say.

397
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,045
You admit you were out there snooping?

398
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,547
Wasn't that naughty of me?
But I'm afraid I was.

399
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,641
I found an address
in George's pocket.

400
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,482
I thought he might be playin' around
with another woman, so I came here.

401
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,819
You'd care if he was playin'
another dame? That would bother you?

402
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:20,021
You don't understand me, Johnny.
You don't know me very well.

403
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,589
I know you like a book.
You're a no-good, nosy little tramp.

404
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,932
You'd sell out your own mother for
a piece of Fudge, but you're smart...

405
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,233
Smart enough to know when to sell
and when to sit tight.

406
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,240
- You know to sit tight in this case.
- I do.

407
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,276
You heard me. You like money.

408
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,835
You got a great big dollar sign there
where most women have a heart.

409
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,849
So play it smart... stay in character,
and you'll have plenty of money.

410
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,816
George'll have it,
then he'll blow it all on you.

411
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,819
Probably buy himself
a five-cent cigar.

412
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,185
You don't know me very well, Johnny.

413
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:50,351
I wouldn't think of letting George
throw his money away on cigars.

414
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,021
Isn't there a big "if"
in there somewhere?

415
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,859
There's a couple of them.

416
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,197
If you're smart, if you keep your trap
shut and don't nose around any more...

417
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,258
You'll have money,
you'll be loaded.

418
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:04,171
But if you don't, we'll forget
the whole thing. You won't have a penny.

419
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,674
I wouldn't like that.

420
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,506
Frail as I am,
I'd much prefer to be loaded.

421
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,912
I think we understand each other.
Now, beat it.

422
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,443
Those guys... fine friends
they turned out to be...

423
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,954
Slappin' me around,
callin' me dirty names.

424
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,014
I thought Randy'd cave
the side of my head in.

425
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,924
Poor George.
You're all right now, aren't you?

426
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,327
You shouldn't have come
over there tonight.

427
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,331
It's a wonder
we both didn't get killed.

428
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,594
I don't think there was
much danger of that.

429
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,262
If they'd killed you,
there couldn't be a robbery.

430
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,170
If they'd done anything to harm me
or offend you...

431
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,333
They have offended me.
They've offended me plenty.

432
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,707
Oh, don't be such an old bear.

433
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,212
They have,
and I'm not gonna forget it.

434
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,649
What else could they have done?
I thought they acted quite reasonably.

435
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,880
Well, anyway...

436
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,048
What... what did Johnny do to you?

437
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,183
Do? I already told you.

438
00:26:56,247 --> 00:27:00,354
Just asked me some questions and made
sure it was all right for me to leave.

439
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,331
Sherry, did Johnny try anything...

440
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,335
What a terrible thing
for you to ask.

441
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,496
I don't think
you'd better say any more.

442
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,064
Why did you come over there tonight?
It wasn't for the reason you said.

443
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,974
It was for the reason you said.
You said it yourself.

444
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,913
I was tryin' to make an alibi for you.
I was afraid those guys'd kill you.

445
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,972
You know I wouldn't look
at another woman.

446
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,417
There wouldn't be any women
chasin' after a guy like me.

447
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,250
Let's drop it, George.

448
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,018
You put words in my mouth,
and then you say they're not true.

449
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,355
I told you exactly what happened.

450
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,024
Oh, dear.

451
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,530
Everything's all right
with you and your pals now.

452
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,533
You're going to have lots of money...

453
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,536
- I've been thinkin' it over.
- I can hardly wait.

454
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,594
How soon will it be? What day?

455
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,540
It ain't going to be.
I'm droppin' out.

456
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:49,101
You're dropping...
You don't mean it. You can't mean it.

457
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,942
I'm afraid, Sherry.

458
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,710
This business tonight
kind of opened my eyes.

459
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:57,777
It made me realize the kind of guys
I was gettin' mixed up with.

460
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,984
- Before, all I thought of was the money.
- Just keep on thinking about that.

461
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,654
Think how disappointed I'd be
if you didn't get that money.

462
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,664
I'm afraid I'd feel like
you didn't really love me.

463
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,326
I don't see how I could feel
any other way.

464
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:15,769
Why should I have to do a thing
like that to prove that I love you?

465
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:19,001
What are you going to do?
I want to know right now.

466
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,340
All you've ever done
is talk about loving me.

467
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,437
That's all I've had
for the last five years, is talk.

468
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,676
Now that you have a chance
to do something...

469
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,686
All those things you promised...
Buy me things...

470
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,517
What are you gonna do?

471
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,786
There ain't a thing in the world
I wouldn't do for you.

472
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,794
Then you'll do this
for me, won't you?

473
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,460
- I guess so.
- It'd be perfect.

474
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:49,300
You have no idea how perfect.
I won't have long to wait, will I?

475
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,204
It will be within
the next few days, won't it?

476
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:55,642
- When will it be?
- You got your own way.

477
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,976
You wanted me to go ahead
with the deal, so I'm going.

478
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,016
Now, leave me alone, will you?

479
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,918
I'm sorry. We won't even talk
about it, if you don't want to.

480
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,320
You really love me, Sherry?

481
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,880
Of course.

482
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,824
You'll always love me?

483
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,657
Always and always.

484
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,969
Three days later at 10:15
on a Tuesday morning...

485
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,804
Johnny Clay began
the final preparations.

486
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,215
You want somebody to play with?

487
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,443
No, thanks.
I'm just looking for a friend.

488
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,343
You patzer. You missed the move.

489
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,945
Knight to knight's five.

490
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,254
Pawn takes knight, rook takes rook,
queen to rook for check.

491
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,760
Bother someone else.
You don't know what you're talkin'.

492
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,990
He couldn't do that.
You don't know what you're talkin'.

493
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,089
Shut up! Make a move.

494
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,362
He's right.
I could've won your rook.

495
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,461
- Move, patzer!
- Stop talkin', or I'll call fisher.

496
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,564
I can't think with all this noise!

497
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,666
Good game, Maurice?

498
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,143
Johnny! My old friend.
How are you?

499
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,271
Good to see you.
Been a long time.

500
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,941
- How long have you been out?
- Not very long.

501
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,042
It was very difficult, no?

502
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,814
Yeah.

503
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,718
Very difficult.

504
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,723
You have my sympathy.

505
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,386
You have not yet learned that in this
life you have to be like everyone else.

506
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,726
The perfect mediocrity.
No better, no worse.

507
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,663
Individuality is a monster...

508
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,997
And it must be strangled
in its cradle...

509
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,503
To make our friends
feel comfortable.

510
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,064
You know, I often thought
that the gangster and the artist...

511
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,736
Are the same
in the eyes of the masses.

512
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,745
They are admired
and hero-worshiped...

513
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,839
But there is always present
others...

514
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,908
To see them destroyed
at the peak of their growth.

515
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,751
Yeah, like the man said...

516
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,655
Life is like a glass of tea, huh?

517
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,557
Oh, Johnny, my friend.

518
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,859
You never were very bright,
but I love you, anyway.

519
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,366
How's life been treating you, Maurice?

520
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,595
About the same as always.

521
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,435
When I need some money,
I go out and wrestle.

522
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,635
But mostly I'm up here
wasting my time playing chess.

523
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,303
But, you know...

524
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,474
I wouldn't know what to do with myself
if I didn't have this place to come to.

525
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,314
Maurice, could you use $2,500?

526
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,220
It has a pleasant ring to the ear,
quite musical.

527
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,882
What is it for?

528
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:25,519
For takin' care of a half a dozen
private dicks, racetrack cops.

529
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,688
I want you to start a fight
with the bartender at the track.

530
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,733
The cops'ii try to break it up.
You'll keep 'em busy as long as you can.

531
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,928
Make 'em drag you outta the place.
No gunplay, strictly a muscle job.

532
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,700
Would it be out of order
for me to ask for what it is...

533
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:40,299
That you are willing to pay such a price
to see me demonstrate my talents?

534
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,939
I would imagine it is for more than
just your own personal entertainment.

535
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,917
$2,500 is a lot of dough.
Part of it's for not askin' questions.

536
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,044
That sounds not unreasonable.

537
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:55,558
Still, I will probably go to jail,
and jails I've found unpleasant.

538
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,856
The food is very bad,
company's poor...

539
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,419
Beds are too small...

540
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,864
It'll only be a disorderly conduct
charge. Maybe 60 days, nothing worse.

541
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,768
If a man has money to spread around in
the right places, he can be comfortable.

542
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,771
I do not quite understand.

543
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:13,934
For what you want me to do,
you could get any hoodlum for $100.

544
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,501
I don't want any hoodlum.
I want a guy like you...

545
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,376
Someone who's
absolutely dependable...

546
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,645
Who knows he's bein' well-paid
to take a risk and won't squawk.

547
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,779
I was thinking if perhaps you cannot
work out some other arrangement.

548
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,722
2,500 I like very much.

549
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,226
But suppose I were willing
to forego part of it...

550
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,889
And take a share
in your enterprise instead.

551
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,295
- It's not mine to share up.
- Very well.

552
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,997
Since there will be details
to work out...

553
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,506
Yeah. I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

554
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,479
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- It's exactly what I wanted.

555
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,918
You could take care of a whole roomful
of people with that gun.

556
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,957
May not kill 'em all, but they wouldn't
be good for anything afterwards.

557
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:05,461
I knew you'd take care of it, Nikki.
How long have you had this place?

558
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,018
Almost a year.

559
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,793
It's picturesque enough,
but there can't be much profit in it.

560
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:13,199
There isn't, but then there isn't
much trouble neither.

561
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,032
What are you thinking about?

562
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:18,097
A job, your kind of a job...
A job with a rifle.

563
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,938
- What kind of money, pops?
- Five thousand.

564
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,878
- Who do I have to kill?
- A horse.

565
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,915
- A horse?
- A four-legged horse.

566
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,042
- For that I get 5,000?
- For that and...

567
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,109
I figured there'd be a gimmick.

568
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,781
The gimmick isn't
as tough as you may think.

569
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,054
You shoot the horse, and if anything
goes wrong, you don't squawk.

570
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:41,621
- All I got to do is bump off a horse?
- It's a special kind of a horse.

571
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,394
For certain reasons, including your own
protection in case anything happens...

572
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,163
I'm not gonna give you the whole story,
just your part of it.

573
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,933
Next Saturday,
the $100,000 handicap is bein' run.

574
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:53,407
In the seventh race, the big race of
the season, a certain horse is runnin'.

575
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,740
He's one of the best three-year-olds
to come along in the last ten years.

576
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,746
He'a big money winner,
and he won't pay even money...

577
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,907
Because half the people there
are going to be down on him.

578
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,885
There's a parking lot less than 300 feet
from the northwest corner of the track.

579
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,217
From a car parked
in the southeast corner of that lot...

580
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,726
You get a perfect view of the horses
as they start into the stretch.

581
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,628
A man in a car parked in that spot
using a rifle with a telescopic sight...

582
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,359
Should be able to bring down
any horse with a single shot.

583
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,732
A man with your eye would hardly need
a telescopic sight.

584
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,362
That horse is worth
a quarter million bucks.

585
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,374
- The crowd would go nuts.
- Let 'em go nuts.

586
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,378
You can do it easy, and you shouldn't
have too much trouble getting away.

587
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,347
Red lightning will undoubtedly
be leadin' in the stretch.

588
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,849
He goes down, a couple of other horses
pile up on top of him.

589
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,614
There'll be plenty of confusion,
I'll guarantee that.

590
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,622
There's one more thing.
Suppose you do get picked up.

591
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:43,386
What've you done? You shot a horse.
It isn't first-degree murder.

592
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,487
It isn't even murder. The best
they could get you on would be...

593
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,533
Inciting a riot
or shooting horses out of season.

594
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,831
The way you put it,
you make it sound real simple.

595
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,132
Five thousand bucks
for rubbin' out a horse.

596
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,407
- Okay. How do I get it?
- 2,500 today, 2,500 after the race.

597
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:05,141
Okay. Crazy. Now tell me something.
What's your angle, John?

598
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:09,310
They'll probably call the race off,
and they won't pay off any of the bets.

599
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,149
Maybe, but what my angle is
is my business.

600
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,157
Five thousand bucks is a lot,
and that's what I'm payin' it for...

601
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,159
So nobody has to know my business.

602
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,253
All right. You'll have no trouble
with me. I'm with you.

603
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,046
- I'm lookin' for Joe piano.
- Who's lookin' for Joe?

604
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,706
- Patsy sent me.
- Patsy who?

605
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,772
- Patsy gennelli.
- Where did you see patsy?

606
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,785
Alcatraz. We roomed together.
My name...

607
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,788
Don't tell me who you are.
What can I do for you?

608
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,051
I want a place to stay
for about a week.

609
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,390
I don't want it cleaned, and I don't
want anybody else in it except myself.

610
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,452
I think I can accommodate you.

611
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,556
- So how's the boy?
- He's fine.

612
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:59,067
He's doin' it on his ear.
He's the best pitcher they got.

613
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,160
He told me to tell you
not to worry about him.

614
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,831
He's doing the book.
I won plenty.

615
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,502
- He's tough. Maybe he'll get a break.
- I know. Let's hope.

616
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,908
Here you are. You don't have
to worry about leaving anything here.

617
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,247
It'll be safe. I'm always here.
There'll be no maid service.

618
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,584
- Want to leave anything in there?
- Just this, and another bag next week.

619
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,590
Don't worry.
Nobody will disturb them.

620
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,957
- What'll it be?
- No charge. You said patsy sent you.

621
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,327
Sure, he sent me. He's a friend,
and I'd feel better if I paid.

622
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,662
It's a business arrangement.
I can afford it.

623
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,497
Then it'll be ten dollars a week.

624
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,266
I'll send the money
and the butts to the boy.

625
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,274
Thank you very much.
Have a nice time.

626
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,007
Four days later at 7:30 a.M ...

627
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,242
Sherry peatty was wide awake.

628
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,760
- Did I wake you up? I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

629
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,857
I just couldn't sleep somehow.

630
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,266
Can I get you anything?
Would you like more coffee?

631
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,601
No, I guess not.
Nice of you to offer, though.

632
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,699
I'm just nervous and restless.
I'll be all right.

633
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,711
- Go on back to bed.
- No, I won't.

634
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,043
Even if I don't get up to get
my husband's breakfast...

635
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,947
The least I can do is sit with him
while he has his coffee.

636
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,384
Gosh, you sure you feel all right...

637
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,047
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that
the way it sounded.

638
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,648
I deserved it.

639
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:06,661
I know I've been irritable and moody
and I haven't acted like I should.

640
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,197
It's just, I can't stand
living like this...

641
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,199
A crummy apartment
and a hamburger for dinner.

642
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:14,862
- You haven't been so bad, baby.
- Yes, I have.

643
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,098
But things are gonna be different.

644
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:22,110
We'll have so many nice things.
I'll stop thinking about myself so much.

645
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,612
Your problems will be my problems.

646
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,343
Whenever you're worried about something,
like now, for instance...

647
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,852
- Is it the robbery you're worried about?
- I guess it is a little.

648
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,855
I have no reason to.
I know it's going to be all right.

649
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,358
Naturally you'd be a little upset
at a time like this.

650
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,223
It's today, isn't it?

651
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,625
What makes you think that? Just
because I could sleep, it doesn't mean...

652
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,636
I know my Georgie.
He can't fool me.

653
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,298
I'm right, aren't I?
Today is the day we get that money.

654
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,432
No, you ain't. It isn't today.

655
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,669
If you don't stop pestering me...

656
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,838
Tryin' to find out something,
there ain't gonna be no money.

657
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,281
- How can you...
- I mean it. I'm gettin' fed up.

658
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:06,049
You heard Johnny. Stop butting in.
He'd call this whole thing off.

659
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,387
He told me something else, too,
which I neglected to tell you...

660
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:13,122
That if I did butt in,
that he'd break my neck.

661
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,859
He wanted to make you understand
that he means business.

662
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,336
All I've gotta say is
you've certainly changed your tune...

663
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:24,100
Since he and his friends
slapped you around.

664
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,107
I was pretty sore about that.

665
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,769
What could they do? You said yourself
they acted pretty reasonable.

666
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,939
- We had no reason to hold a grudge.
- I'm not gonna argue with you.

667
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,915
If you let people beat you up and then
take their side against your own wife...

668
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,476
But you did. I wanted to quit.
You wouldn't let me.

669
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,783
You said I had no reason to.

670
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:45,191
Anyway, Johnny didn't lay a hand on me.
None of the guys did, but Randy.

671
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,923
I was gonna tell you somethin'
about your friend Johnny...

672
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,158
But since you feel about him
like you do...

673
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,167
Take his word against mine.

674
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,171
What about him?
What were you gonna tell me?

675
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,537
Let's stop the conversation
right there.

676
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,270
What were you gonna tell me?

677
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:05,439
I don't think I can tell you
when you feel like you do about him...

678
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:09,007
Not havin' any faith in me
in keepin' secrets.

679
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,282
We won't have any secrets.
What happened?

680
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,621
I tried to tell you about this
the other night, but...

681
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,389
You were so upset and anytime I tried
to say anything, you cut me off.

682
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:23,057
What are you tryin' to tell me?

683
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,997
I tried to stop him.
I pleaded and I struggled.

684
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,002
It doesn't matter, does it?

685
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,340
The only thing that matters
is how I feel about you.

686
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,281
It is today, isn't it?

687
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,087
Earlier that morning at 5:00 a.M ...

688
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,521
Red lightning was fed
only a half portion of feed...

689
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,423
In preparation for the seventh race
that afternoon...

690
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,088
The $100,000 landsdowne stakes.

691
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,934
At 7:00 that morning,
Johnny Clay began what might be...

692
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,027
The last day of his life.

693
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,544
- What time is it?
- It's early yet. It's only 7:00.

694
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,877
You better go back to sleep
after I leave.

695
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:17,215
I just wanted to say good-bye,
till tonight, that is.

696
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,220
Everything's all set.
Should go perfectly.

697
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:22,223
But if it doesn't,
don't talk about this with anyone.

698
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,988
You'll be in the clear except for your
books. I don't think they'll be rough...

699
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,260
I'm not worried about that.
I'm not worried about anything.

700
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,824
I just wish
I could do more to help.

701
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,360
You've done your part.
I only hope we can do ours as well.

702
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,374
We'll probably never see
each other again...

703
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,240
After we split the money
and break up tonight.

704
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,506
In my book, you'll always be
a stand-up guy.

705
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:51,082
I don't know how to say this,
and I don't know if I have the right...

706
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:54,884
But I've always thought
maybe you're like my own kid.

707
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,891
You can say anything you want.

708
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:00,759
You've had a lot of rough breaks
and maybe you've made a few mistakes...

709
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,695
But after today...

710
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,700
The good lord willing,
you'll be a new man...

711
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,861
A rich man.

712
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,462
That can make a lot of difference.

713
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,533
You've got a lot of life ahead of you,
a lot of people to meet...

714
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,374
People of quality and substance.

715
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,243
What are you gettin' at?

716
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:22,250
Wouldn't it be great if we could
just go away, the two of us...

717
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,719
And let the old world
take a couple of turns and...

718
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:29,223
Have a chance
to take stock of things?

719
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,556
It can be pretty serious
and terrible...

720
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,562
Particularly if it's not
the right person.

721
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,393
Getting married, I mean.

722
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:40,060
You better go back to sleep.

723
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:44,732
The seventh race starts about 4:30,
if you wanna catch it on the radio.

724
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,797
I'll be back here about 7:00.

725
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,308
Keep away from the track.
Go to a movie or something.

726
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,077
See you later.

727
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,522
It was exactly 7:00 A.M.
when he got to the airport.

728
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,025
The weight is okay, Mr. Preston.
Is that all the baggage?

729
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,589
I'll have one more with me tonight.
I can keep that in the cabin, can't I?

730
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,534
Yes, but check in here at the counter
prior to flight time.

731
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,198
Flight 465 leaves at 9:00 p.M. Tonight.

732
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,367
- Thank you.
- Thank you for flying American, sir.

733
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:27,374
Stopping first at a florist,
he arrived at the motel at 8:15.

734
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,213
He was on schedule.

735
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,480
- Good morning, my friend.
- Good morning, Joe.

736
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,888
This afternoon a friend of mine is
stopping by and leaving a bundle for me.

737
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,550
- He's a cop.
- A cop?

738
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,652
He drives a prowl car.

739
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,994
- A funny kind of friend you have.
- He's a funny kind of a cop.

740
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,499
Let him in.
He'll leave this bundle about 6:30.

741
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:48,400
I'll pick it up right after that,
and that's the last you'll see of me.

742
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,235
- Would you come in for a drink?
- I'd like to, but I got a lot to do.

743
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,742
- If I did, everything'd be fouled up.
- I understand. I'll see you tonight.

744
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,744
So long. Take care of yourself.

745
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,559
He reached the bus station
at 8:45.

746
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,282
It was 9:20 when he arrived
at Mike's apartment.

747
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:19,259
So far, everything had gone off
according to plan.

748
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,170
Mike O'Reilly was ready at 11:15.

749
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,933
What goes on here?

750
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,497
This is no way
to get your strength back.

751
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,137
It's very good,
but I guess I'm just not hungry.

752
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,238
- I couldn't eat another bite.
- Another?

753
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,340
You haven't eaten anything yet.

754
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:45,182
I'll take something after a while,
after I've had my medicine.

755
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,587
- I'll have more appetite then.
- That's a promise. No tricks now.

756
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:52,593
It's a promise. You better go along,
or you'll be late for work.

757
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,220
Yeah, I guess I will.

758
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:58,289
Ruthie, things are gonna get
much better for us.

759
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,995
I know. I know, dear.

760
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:04,505
I know I've made a lot of promises
in the past, but...

761
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,507
This time it's not just talk.

762
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,509
We're gonna be rich, and soon.

763
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,444
You're gonna have a fine house
and doctors that'll make you well again.

764
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:15,109
Of course, dear.
You'd better go along or you'll be late.

765
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,617
Yeah.

766
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,485
- Mike?
- Yes?

767
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,219
On your way home tonight,
would you bring me some magazines?

768
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,783
Of course.

769
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:30,355
But I'm going to be a little late,
probably about 10:00.

770
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,991
Some of the fellows and me
are having a little get-together.

771
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,501
I understand.

772
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,663
Don't you drink too much beer.

773
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,173
Remember how it always
leaves you the next day.

774
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,904
Don't worry about that.
I won't be doing any drinking tonight.

775
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,910
I called mother. She'll be over
this afternoon to fix your dinner.

776
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,579
Thank you, dear. Good-bye.

777
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,524
Don't forget to eat your breakfast.

778
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:21,008
He reached the bus station at 11:29.

779
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,610
At 12:10, as it was his custom,
he arrived at the track.

780
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,662
What have we got here?
Who's the girlfriend?

781
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,328
That's how you spend your money...
On dames.

782
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,167
An old man like you
that ought to know better.

783
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,401
I ain't like you guys.
These posies are for my wife.

784
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:24,776
Besides, where do you guys get off
calling me an old man?

785
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,940
Why don't you buy your flowers
after work?

786
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,950
They'll wilt before you get home.

787
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:33,182
It can't be helped. After work,
the shops will all be closed.

788
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,519
Why don't you put them in some water?

789
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,685
The clubhouse steward
would put 'em in the refrigerator.

790
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,025
Perhaps I should, but...

791
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,756
It's getting late now...

792
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,664
- Why don't I do it for you?
- No!

793
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,329
I was just tryin'
to do you a favor.

794
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,863
The flowers are going in my locker.
Then I'll know where they are.

795
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,534
Okay. Suit yourself.

796
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,272
I'm sorry, bill.
I appreciate your offer.

797
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,439
After work, you know how it is.

798
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,484
Everybody'ii be in a hurry
to get away and...

799
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,484
Third and trumpet king.

800
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,995
It is my baby leading by a length.

801
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:51,123
Concentrator is second
by three-quarters of a length.

802
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:54,260
Second ending, moving fast
on the outside, is third.

803
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,201
And trumpet king.

804
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,763
It is my baby, concentrator
and second ending.

805
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,209
It is second ending,
concentrator and trumpet king.

806
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,042
It is second ending and concentrator
down to the wire.

807
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,879
It's second ending the winner
by a half a length.

808
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,885
Concentrator's second by two...

809
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,148
Trumpet king, third,
and my baby.

810
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:18,817
The result of the first race
now appears on the board.

811
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,055
Be sure to hold all tickets...

812
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,292
Until the result of the race
is declared official.

813
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,199
After the first race,
Mike was very busy.

814
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,841
Give me a double bourbon, please.

815
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,251
Don't you think
you've had enough, pal?

816
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,624
Your attention, please.

817
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,060
The horses are now on the track
for the second race at six furlongs.

818
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,860
At exactly 3:32
that same afternoon...

819
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,368
Officer Randy Kennon set in motion
his phase of the operation.

820
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,738
Hello, Fred.
This is Randy.

821
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:10,438
Check the dispatcher's office and see if
they've been gettin' me loud and clear.

822
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,038
I think my set's
a little on the blink. Sure.

823
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,051
What? He says it's okay?

824
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,683
That's funny.
It keeps goin' dead.

825
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,957
I don't think it's one of the tubes.
I'll keep foolin' around with it.

826
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:32,626
Give my regards to your missus.
When's the big day supposed to be?

827
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:36,262
Well, don't worry about it.
The sixth one is always the hardest.

828
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,741
Officer!

829
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:56,286
Thank heaven! Hurry! Come quick!
They're killing each other!

830
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,292
I always knew they...

831
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:05,095
He had timed the trip to the track
on half a dozen different occasions...

832
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:08,534
And he knew at just what point
he should be at precisely what time.

833
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,539
He knew the entire success of the plan
depended on his accuracy...

834
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:14,235
In arriving at the track
at exactly the correct moment.

835
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,904
A minute or two early was allowable,
but ten seconds late would be fatal.

836
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,012
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

837
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:25,645
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

838
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:30,454
The $100,000 added
landsdowne stakes at one mile.

839
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,952
And they're off and running!

840
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,149
At the start it is red lightning
breaking on top.

841
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,853
Early streak is second. I'm hoping
is third. White fire is fourth.

842
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:09,830
Earlier that afternoon, at 2:30,
Maurice was at the chess club.

843
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,162
He was to be at the track
in position at 4:00...

844
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,668
Just before the start
of the seventh race.

845
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:22,238
Fisher, I am supposed to be
back here tonight about 6:30.

846
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,745
If I'm not, I'd like you
to do something for me.

847
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,212
Sure. What is it?

848
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,409
I'd like you to call this number
and ask for Mr. stillman...

849
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,578
And tell him
Maurice requires his services.

850
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,384
Sounds pretty mysterious.
What's it all about?

851
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:39,825
There are some things, my dear fisher,
which do not bear much looking into.

852
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,159
You have undoubtedly heard
of the siberian goatherd...

853
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,722
Who tried to discover
the true nature of the sun.

854
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:48,702
He stared up at the heavenly body
until it made him blind.

855
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:53,070
There are many things of this sort,
including love and death.

856
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:56,076
Please remember to make that call
if I'm not back at 6:30.

857
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,077
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

858
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:03,447
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

859
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:07,716
The $100,000 added
landsdowne stakes at one mile.

860
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,790
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

861
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:15,557
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

862
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:19,965
The $100,000 added
landsdowne stakes at one mile.

863
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,478
- Yes, sir?
- Bottle of beer.

864
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:49,086
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

865
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,832
The horses are at the gate.

866
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:19,750
Hey! Can I have some service,
you stupid-looking Irish pig!

867
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,090
What's the matter...

868
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,950
Come on, break it up!

869
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,424
It was exactly 4:23
when they dragged Maurice out.

870
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,689
At 11:40 that morning,
Nikki left his farm.

871
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,707
He arrived at the track at 12:30.

872
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,445
- Hi, there.
- Use the other parking lot.

873
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,389
- I don't like to trouble you.
- You're not troubling me.

874
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,326
There's no parking here,
and that's that.

875
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:36,296
Look, Mac, I'm a paraplegic...

876
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:39,265
And I want to get in this lot
to watch the races from my car.

877
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,268
That ain't my problem, mister.

878
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:45,397
My leg's bum too,
but nobody's feeling sorry for me.

879
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,409
I know what you mean, buddy.

880
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,571
- Get that in the war?
- Battle of the bulge.

881
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,844
Look, I know this is a lot of
extra trouble for you. I want you to...

882
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:59,478
- No. Skip it.
- I want you to take it.

883
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,182
Now go on, keep it.

884
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,653
It's all right.

885
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,957
- Thanks, mister. I'm sorry...
- Forget it.

886
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:12,523
Will you take down that fence? I'd like
to settle down before the first race.

887
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:15,001
- Okay?
- Sure, mister.

888
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,890
Your attention, please. The horses are
now on the track for the second race...

889
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,901
At six furlongs.

890
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,570
I had this layin' around, mister.
I thought you might like to have it.

891
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,577
Thanks.
That's very kind of you.

892
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,443
No trouble at all.
If you need anything else, just call.

893
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:03,075
I doubt if I'll need anything.
I'm getting along just fine.

894
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,641
But thanks anyway.

895
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,187
Who you bettin' on?
Anything look good to you?

896
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,223
- Red lightning.
- Huh?

897
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,692
- Red lightning in the seventh.
- So you're bettin' on him, huh?

898
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,229
Yeah. I got a little bet
down on him.

899
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:18,198
I guess I'd better be
gettin' back to work.

900
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:21,531
- Thanks for bringin' me the program.
- No trouble at all.

901
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,197
You sure there's nothing else
I can do for you?

902
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,140
Nothing at all. If I think of anything,
I can give you a yell.

903
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:53,330
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

904
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:57,030
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

905
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,303
The $100,000 added
landsdowne stakes at one mile.

906
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:10,041
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.

907
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,657
- Sure is a nice day, ain't it?
- Yeah.

908
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:32,002
Didn't think it would be when I first
got up today, but it turned out fine.

909
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,166
Kind of funny
when you stop to look at it.

910
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,473
Weather's almost the same
as it always is this time of year, but...

911
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,307
I sure appreciate
the way you treat me, mister.

912
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,944
It's not so much the money. Of course
I appreciate that too, but it's more...

913
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,511
- Forget it.
- No, sir.

914
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,217
I don't reckon
I'll ever forget it.

915
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:53,852
I brought you some luck, mister.
I figured you might need it.

916
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:56,522
Look. Keep your junk
and leave me alone, will you?

917
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:59,692
- Somethin' wrong?
- You're wrong, nigger!

918
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:03,003
Be a nice guy
and go on about your business.

919
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,470
Sure, boss.

920
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,066
Sorry to have bothered you.

921
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,078
My mistake.

922
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,115
And they're off and running!

923
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,627
At the start it is
red lightning breaking on top.

924
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,630
Early streak is second.
I'm hoping is third.

925
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,064
White fire is fourth.

926
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:36,001
Little Arnie is next.
Seymour's Darling and best seller.

927
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,632
Moving down the backstretch, it's
red lightning by a length and a quarter.

928
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,677
I'm hoping is second
by three-quarters of a length.

929
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,440
Little Arnie is third
by a length and a quarter...

930
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,538
And Seymour's Darling.

931
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:49,207
Passing the half-mile post...

932
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,377
It is red lightning
by a length and a quarter.

933
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,217
I'm hoping is second
by a half a length.

934
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,314
Seymour's Darling is third...

935
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,916
And Little Arnie
moving fast to the outside.

936
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:01,723
Into the far turn
it is red lightning...

937
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,162
In front by
a length and a quarter.

938
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,258
Little Arnie is second by half a length.
I'm hoping is third.

939
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:11,237
And a horse is down!
It is red lightning.

940
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,400
At the head of the stretch,
it is I'm hoping...

941
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:17,411
Taking the lead
by half a length.

942
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,012
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

943
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:31,688
Down to the wire, it is Little Arnie
going steadily, holding it and winning.

944
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,228
Nikki was dead at 4:24.

945
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:38,060
At 2:15 that afternoon,
Johnny Clay was still in the city.

946
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,727
He knew exactly how long it would
take him to drive to the track...

947
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,997
Park his car
and walk to the grandstand.

948
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,438
He planned to arrive just before
the start of the seventh race.

949
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,679
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

950
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,908
The horses are now on the track
for the seventh race.

951
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:01,620
The $100,000 added
landsdowne stakes at one mile.

952
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:13,119
The horses are approaching
the starting gate...

953
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,128
For the seventh race.

954
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:23,833
Hey! How about some service,
you stupid-looking Irish pig!

955
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,778
Money room. Claude here.

956
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,973
Yes, sir, right away.

957
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,312
There's a riot downstairs.
Come on.

958
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,476
And they're off and running!

959
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,108
At the start it is red lightning
breaking on top.

960
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:15,315
Early streak is second. I'm hoping
is third. White fire is fourth.

961
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,380
Little Arnie is next.

962
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,790
Seymour's Darling
and best seller.

963
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:23,319
Moving down the backstretch, it's
red lightning by a length and a quarter.

964
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:26,390
I'm hoping is second
by three-quarters of a length.

965
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:29,095
Little Arnie is third
by a length and a quarter...

966
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:31,195
And Seymour's Darling.

967
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:35,106
Passing the half-mile post, it is
red lightning by a length and a quarter.

968
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:37,906
I'm hoping is second
by a half a length.

969
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,913
Seymour's Darling is third...

970
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,506
And Little Arnie
moving fast on the outside.

971
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,381
Into the far turn
it is red lightning...

972
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,443
In front by
a length and a quarter.

973
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:50,889
Little Arnie is second by half a length.
I'm hoping is third.

974
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,895
And a horse is down!
It is red lightning.

975
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:59,627
At the head of the stretch, it is I'm
hoping taking the lead by half a length.

976
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:03,262
Little Arnie driving on the outside,
second by three quarters.

977
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:06,796
Seymour's Darling is third
and early streak.

978
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:09,138
It is Little Arnie
and Seymour's Darling.

979
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:11,007
It's Little Arnie in front.

980
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,741
Down to the wire, it is
Little Arnie going steadily...

981
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:17,512
Holding it and winning it
by three-quarters of a length.

982
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:21,614
I'm hoping is second
by three-quarters of a length.

983
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:24,453
Seymour's Darling
is third by a half...

984
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,959
And white fire finishes fourth.

985
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:34,959
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
Be sure to hold all tickets.

986
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:38,767
The stewards are conducting an inquiry
into the running of the seventh race...

987
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,104
And they'll view
the motion picture.

988
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,559
Get your hands up!

989
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,892
One move out of any one of you
and I'm gonna start firing.

990
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:06,900
You! Fill that bag up
just as fast as you know how.

991
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,300
You! Take that gun
out of the holster.

992
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,739
Be awful careful how you do it.

993
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,715
Now drop it.

994
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,452
Kick it over here.

995
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,654
Turn toward the wall.

996
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,934
All right,
now the money in the safe.

997
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,940
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

998
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,603
We have received
no exact information...

999
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,977
Concerning the spill of red lightning
in the seventh race.

1000
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:57,506
However, jockey Danny Freed
appears to be unhurt.

1001
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:02,288
- Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
- Fill it up!

1002
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,620
We have received
no exact information...

1003
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,684
Concerning the spill of red lightning
in the seventh race.

1004
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,254
However, jockey Danny Freed
appears to be unhurt.

1005
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:41,622
All right, that's enough. Now put
the bag in the middle of the floor.

1006
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,625
Get back over there.

1007
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,431
Now, I'm gonna open this door.

1008
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:52,564
Go through it and go into
the locker room, and close the door.

1009
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,075
I'm gonna start firing through that door
15 seconds after you close the door.

1010
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:59,706
Let's go.

1011
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,656
Close it!

1012
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,703
- Just a minute.
- What are you doing?

1013
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,387
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you a special news bulletin.

1014
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:24,022
In one of the most daring and carefully
executed holdups in criminal history...

1015
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:27,795
A lone bandit wearing a rubber mask
today took an estimated $2 million...

1016
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:31,736
Stuffed into a large duffel bag from the
offices of the landsdowne racetrack.

1017
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,138
It occurred during
the running of the seventh race...

1018
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:37,268
And was apparently timed to coincide
with the shooting of red lightning...

1019
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:41,907
Just as the horse, valued at $250,000,
was leading the pack at the far turn.

1020
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,508
The jockey, Danny Freed,
escaped with minor injuries.

1021
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:48,385
A man identified as Nikki Arane, who
allegedly shot the prize thoroughbred...

1022
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,720
Was himself fatally wounded
by track police...

1023
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,385
As he attempted to shoot his way
out of the track parking lot.

1024
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:56,953
At this time, the most baffling mystery
that still plagues the authorities...

1025
01:10:57,019 --> 01:11:00,228
Is just how the bandit managed to
successfully get away from the track...

1026
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,667
With the bulky duffel bag
containing the money.

1027
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,433
A painstaking search of
the track grounds is being conducted...

1028
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:08,134
On the theory that the money
may still be hidden there.

1029
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:11,974
And now we take you back
to our regularly scheduled program.

1030
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,105
No one saw the duffel bag
come out of the window.

1031
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,449
That part of it worked okay.

1032
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,286
Landed right at my feet.

1033
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:28,021
I reported my radio out of order
before I went out to the track.

1034
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:31,394
But the captain ain't buyin' it. He
thinks I was holed up somewhere drunk.

1035
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:35,230
And if the captain's convinced, there
ain't nobody that can un-convince him.

1036
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:41,305
Besides, no one's gonna think anything
of seein' a cop at the racetrack.

1037
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:45,709
I mean, they won't get any funny ideas
about it and tie it in with the robbery.

1038
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:50,309
Anyway, if they do,
it won't cut any ice.

1039
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:54,377
Captain knows I was drunk,
and he ain't a man you can argue with.

1040
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:57,617
So I guess I'll just have to
break down and admit it...

1041
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,626
And take my punishment.

1042
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:04,028
Yeah. That would be terrible,
wouldn't it, Randy? A 30-day suspension.

1043
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,261
It's 7:15.

1044
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:08,962
Don't worry. He'll get here.

1045
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:12,528
He had to pick up the dough
at the motel where I dropped it.

1046
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:16,770
There was a funny little guy name of Joe
piano there. Runs the place, I guess.

1047
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,039
Hope Johnny knows
how to pick his friends.

1048
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,047
I need another drink.

1049
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,379
Why ain't he here?

1050
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:29,287
Everything else runs on a timetable
till it comes to payin' us our shares.

1051
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,349
Then the timetable breaks down.

1052
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:35,224
He was supposed
to be here at 7:00.

1053
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,528
- I think I hear the elevator.
- That'll be Johnny.

1054
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,076
- Everybody up.
- What is this?

1055
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:52,669
It'll be a massacre
if you don't keep those mitts up.

1056
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,681
Where's Johnny?
What time's he due?

1057
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:59,110
I've been sittin' out in that car
since 4:00 listenin' to that radio.

1058
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:02,849
I heard some pretty interesting things.
Grandpa, what time's Johnny comin'?

1059
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,892
Somebody give you
a bum steer, buddy.

1060
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,121
Look around.

1061
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:12,632
Can't believe you were tipped, huh?
Well, if I had a certain lady here...

1062
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,929
- Where's the jerk? Where's George?
- Right here!

1063
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:50,695
Forty minutes before, at 6:25,
Johnny reached the motel.

1064
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,571
Due to heavy traffic around the track,
he was 15 minutes behind schedule.

1065
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,546
Yeah? Who is it?

1066
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,813
Oh, it's just a mistake.
I'm sorry.

1067
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:33,437
Johnny arrived at the meeting place
at 7:29, still 15 minutes late.

1068
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:45,020
It had been prearranged
and agreed to by all...

1069
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,492
That in the event of
an emergency before the split...

1070
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:50,587
The money was to be saved by whoever
had possession of it at that time...

1071
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,258
Without any consideration
of the fate of the others...

1072
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,132
The money to be divided
in safety at a later date.

1073
01:14:56,191 --> 01:15:00,071
After what he'd seen, not knowing the
cause or circumstances of the others...

1074
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:03,337
Johnny had no choice
but to save himself and the money.

1075
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:14,511
Ten minutes later, he bought
the largest suitcase he could find.

1076
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,155
I'm back here, val Darling.

1077
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,800
How'd it go, dear?

1078
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:40,205
- Watch out.
- What happened?

1079
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:45,201
Sherry... Why did you do it?

1080
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,645
Do what, dearest?
I don't know what you're talking about.

1081
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,809
I was just getting some clothes ready
to go to the cleaners.

1082
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,979
So you had to be stupid.

1083
01:16:57,045 --> 01:17:00,652
You couldn't even play it smart
with a gun pointed at you.

1084
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:03,993
You better get smart fast and get
out of here while you can still walk.

1085
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,629
It's your friend.
Val? Is that his name?

1086
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,569
Yes, and you better get out of here
before he gets here.

1087
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,135
I'm sick, Sherry.

1088
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,144
Call an ambulance.

1089
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,478
The door's behind you.
Take a cab.

1090
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,620
I love you, Sherry.

1091
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:31,251
You'd better go.
You look terrible.

1092
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:39,027
It isn't fair.

1093
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:41,761
I never had anybody but you.

1094
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,930
Not a real husband.

1095
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,940
Not even a man.

1096
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:53,143
Just a had joke
without a punch line.

1097
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,888
Ain't fair.

1098
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:23,565
American Airlines announces
the arrival of flight 808...

1099
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:26,545
Dc-7 service from Chicago.

1100
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,230
Sebastian and I are so excited.

1101
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:54,263
We haven't seen daddy sweetums
for such a long, long time.

1102
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:58,038
Would the nice man let us wait outside
so we could look at the airplanes?

1103
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,102
You can stand outside
on the boarding ramp.

1104
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:03,081
We'll be announcing the arrival
of your husband's flight very shortly.

1105
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:05,880
He's a sweetums man,
isn't hims?

1106
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:09,354
Let's hurry up real fast
and see daddy come off the airplane.

1107
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,819
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1108
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:16,158
Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Preston,
9:00 flight for Boston.

1109
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:23,494
We'll be announcing the on-time
departure of this flight very shortly.

1110
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:26,334
- Do you have any other baggage?
- It was checked through this morning.

1111
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,603
I wanna carry that bag
with me on the plane, please.

1112
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:33,737
I'm sorry. It's much too large. This'ii
have to check through as baggage.

1113
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:37,011
Now, let's be
a little reasonable, huh?

1114
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:41,543
The two of us together are not entitled
to one piece of luggage between us?

1115
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,614
We have no objection
to one small bag.

1116
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:47,057
But we don't have anything else.
It's already been checked through.

1117
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:48,788
I see.

1118
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:52,354
Even though it's getting close to flight
time, we can locate your other luggage.

1119
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,866
You could transfer the contents
of this to a smaller one.

1120
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:56,960
That won't work at all.
Now look.

1121
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:59,232
Let me talk to
your supervisor, huh?

1122
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:02,867
I'll be very happy to call him.
Mr. grimes?

1123
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:05,775
Mr. grimes, could you
come down this way, please?

1124
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:11,716
- What can I do for you?
- My wife and I are going to Boston.

1125
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:14,947
Our luggage has been checked through,
and I wanna take this bag in the cabin.

1126
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,650
It exceeds the maximum cabin size
for flight requirements.

1127
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:20,784
It does look quite a bit too large
for the passenger compartment.

1128
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:24,558
Sir, those are our flight regulations,
designed for your comfort and safety.

1129
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,429
- I can't make the trip without it.
- You really can't?

1130
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:31,266
- Absolutely not.
- In that case, I think we can...

1131
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,431
I know it's past
cancellation time...

1132
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:36,567
But under the circumstances
I think we might stretch a point.

1133
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:38,770
We'll give you full rebate
on your tickets.

1134
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,371
Wait a minute.
I don't want a rebate.

1135
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:44,042
Well, sir, I don't know
what else to suggest.

1136
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:46,642
It's close to flight time.
There are other passengers waiting.

1137
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,915
Perhaps the gentleman's
worried about the contents.

1138
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:51,480
- We'd be happy to insure it.
- We'd be delighted.

1139
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,992
If you'd give me its estimated value
and tell me what's in it.

1140
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:59,021
There's nothing in it.
Just personal items, things like that.

1141
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,658
All right, check it through.

1142
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:05,227
Thank you, sir. You'll find the service
to your complete satisfaction.

1143
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,671
Flight 40, the new englander...

1144
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:11,734
Dc-7 service to Boston
at gate eight.

1145
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,963
No, Sebastian.

1146
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:43,407
Was we frightened
by the airplane?

1147
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:46,776
We go for trip
on nice airplane someday.

1148
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,725
Come back here!

1149
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:53,071
Mr. Preston,
we'll be announcing boarding...

1150
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:59,216
Grimes speaking. What?

1151
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:02,118
Oh, you're not serious?

1152
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,521
Right out on the runway?

1153
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,525
Yes, sir.
Right away.

1154
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,667
Will passenger Preston...

1155
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:18,102
Please report to
the American Airlines ticket counter.

1156
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,105
Taxi!

1157
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:51,267
Johnny, you've got to run.
