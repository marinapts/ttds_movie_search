1
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:09,468
Conductor didn't want to play.
How's this guy?

2
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,110
Nice and willing.

3
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:13,445
Stop the train and let us off.

4
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,244
When we tell you.

5
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:26,785
Ed, Cotton, when we get the train
on the spur, start hopping. Go.

6
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,125
Zuckie, you know what to do?

7
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:30,462
Sure. I throw the switch,
and then I beat it back...

8
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:33,263
All right, just do it. Stop the gabbing.

9
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,686
All right. This is where we want off.

10
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,517
Stop it right here.

11
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:34,893
Get away from those controls.

12
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,556
What's this? A holdup?

13
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,763
No. You're seven minutes late.
We're just changing engineers.

14
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,997
A lot fancier than my old coal burner
on the C and O.

15
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,335
Shut up.

16
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,188
Open up and you won't get hurt.

17
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,297
Sounds bad, Cody.

18
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,131
Why don't you give my address, too?

19
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:25,876
Only the treasury stuff!

20
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,114
Hurry up.

21
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:37,088
You won't get away with it, Cody.

22
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,060
Cody, huh?

23
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,563
Go get the car started.

24
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:45,423
You've got a good memory for names.
Too good.

25
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,093
Zuckie got scalded.

26
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:15,161
Come on, let's get out of here.

27
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,503
A week has passed since bandits jumped
a mail train...

28
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,300
coming out of the High Sierra Tunnel...

29
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:27,605
and fled with $300,000 in federal currency,
leaving four dead.

30
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:31,874
<i>Treasury authorities now believe
the gang has escaped to Arizona...</i>

31
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:34,644
<i>where today a bank was raided
and two tellers killed...</i>

32
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,277
<i>with the same cold-bloodedness
that characterized...</i>

33
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:39,548
Now we're supposed to be in Arizona.

34
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:42,182
Any place would be better than this.

35
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,050
We got to blow out of here.

36
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:47,619
Cody calls
charging roadblocks unscientific.

37
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,961
It ain't safe having a crackpot
giving orders.

38
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,058
- It's about time somebody took over.
- Who?

39
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:54,228
A very good friend of mine: me.

40
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,703
Where do you want the body sent?

41
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,509
Been golfing, Ed?

42
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:11,745
We got a sack full of dough and
we're holed up like a bunch of gophers.

43
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,448
When we moving out?

44
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:17,117
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe in the spring.

45
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,285
Ill give it a lot of thought. All right?

46
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,107
It smells good, Ma.

47
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:35,770
lf you're getting hungry,
l could do with some help, son.

48
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:48,588
Verna. Help Ma with the groceries.

49
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,577
Well, if it ain't the sleeping beauty.

50
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,909
What else does a girl do
around this bear trap?

51
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,814
There's plenty you can do
without wearing out the mattress.

52
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:19,412
It's the only place I don't freeze.
I've been cold for a week. Not even a fire.

53
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,886
Who's gonna see a little bit of smoke
100 miles from nowhere?

54
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,688
Help Ma with the grub.

55
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:30,123
He's getting worse. He needs a doc.

56
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,599
When the time comes.

57
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,797
- Want some coffee, Ed?
- Thanks, Verna.

58
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:43,437
Let him get it himself.
My wife don't wait on nobody.

59
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:49,151
You know something, Verna...

60
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,483
if I turn my back long enough
for Big Ed to put a hole in it...

61
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,546
there'd be a hole in it.

62
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,592
Big Ed. Great Big Ed.

63
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:03,097
You know why they call him that?

64
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,225
Because his ideas are big.

65
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:09,833
Someday he's gonna get a really big one
about me.

66
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,567
It'll be his last.

67
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,928
That's the second one he's had in a month.

68
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:42,436
He's nuts, just like his old man.

69
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,015
It's these mountains, Cody.

70
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:01,254
It's not good for you, cold all the time.

71
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,725
Can't breathe the air.

72
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,758
Let's get out, son.

73
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,235
It's going.

74
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,141
- It's going?
- Yeah.

75
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,806
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

76
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:34,248
It's like having a red-hot buzz saw
inside my head.

77
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:43,930
No, not yet, son.

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,198
Don't let them see you like that.
Might give some of them ideas.

79
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,942
Always thinking about your Cody,
aren't you?

80
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,504
That's right.

81
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,231
Top of the world, son.

82
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:22,032
Don't know what Id do without you, Ma.

83
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,470
- Better?
- Yeah.

84
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,378
Now go on out.
Show them you're all right.

85
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,154
What are you all gaping at?

86
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,495
And I thought I told you
to help Ma with the groceries.

87
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,396
Cody, there's a storm coming.

88
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,801
Every road's gonna be blocked,
the guy said.

89
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,169
- What guy?
- On the radio.

90
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:01,572
- How long did he give it?
- Tonight.

91
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,306
That's just what I've been waiting for.
Is everything packed?

92
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,870
We been packed for a week.

93
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,642
You sure it's safe, Cody?

94
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:11,448
A storm keeps everybody busy.
Clean up this place, and clean it up right.

95
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,689
And don't leave any calling cards.

96
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,653
l told you to keep away from that radio.

97
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:21,697
lf that battery is dead, it'll have company.

98
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,005
It's your suitcase, Cody.

99
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,131
Why don't you keep it all?

100
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:36,838
You're cute. Come here.

101
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,880
Why don't you?
We could travel, buy things.

102
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,358
That's what money's for.

103
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:52,418
l look good in a mink coat, honey.

104
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,890
You'd look good in a shower curtain.

105
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,802
We're pals, Cotton.

106
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,333
You'll see that I get away all right,
see that I get to a doc?

107
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,073
Sure, Zuckie.

108
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,807
We're all set.

109
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,377
Cody, I was pretty good
back there on the train, huh?

110
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:20,115
- Pretty good for my first job, huh?
- Yeah, you were great.

111
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,888
You won't leave me here.
You'll take me with you.

112
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,858
We can't take chances
of being picked up with you in the car.

113
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:28,362
We'll send a doc back right away.

114
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,656
You're gonna let me die.

115
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:41,636
Cotton, don't leave me.

116
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:50,017
Suppose they find him?
You know how Zuckie talks.

117
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:52,217
He won't talk. Cotton.

118
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:55,454
You meant what you said
about sending a doc?

119
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,084
Yeah, sure. A specialist. You.

120
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:04,360
Here. lf you're such a pal of his.
Go back and make it easy for him.

121
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:14,698
Rest easy, Ma. We're 300 miles
from the tunnel. What have they got?

122
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,012
A corpse without a record.

123
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:20,104
Nothing to tie him in
with the tunnel job or us.

124
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:28,389
Don't make a sound. It's me, Cotton.
Look, I'll try to come back.

125
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,783
Here's some cigarettes.

126
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,384
Thanks, Cotton.

127
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,405
Ed, we'll separate.

128
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:57,611
Go east until you hit the highway,
and double back over the bridge.

129
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:00,450
Stay on dirt roads all the way. You hear?

130
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,243
Hope I didn't get you up here
on a wild goose chase, Mr. Evans.

131
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:31,218
Geese we're looking for are pretty wild.

132
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,256
A couple of hunters found him frozen
up in the mountains.

133
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,982
We started wondering: stranger,
bullet hole in the roof of the cabin...

134
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,893
particularly the condition of his face.
Tell him, Doc.

135
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,328
Despite the third-degree burn...

136
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,696
the eyebrows and hairline
weren't even singed.

137
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,327
That means either boiling water or steam.

138
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:49,769
So, we thought of a steam engine.

139
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,473
Good hunch. Get me his clothes.

140
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:56,641
Ernie, get his fingerprints.
Take a mask of his face.

141
00:14:56,712 --> 00:15:00,580
Here you are, Mr. Evans. Nothing in the
pockets but this pack of cigarettes.

142
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,164
So like you told me, Mr. Evans,
l made the rounds for a month.

143
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,670
Drifting, kind of. Not too eager.

144
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:26,435
You know, just dropping a word
in the right ear...

145
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,705
that Im interested in picking up
a few odd dollars.

146
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,379
Not a buck from the tunnel job showed up.

147
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:35,644
They haven't buried it in tin cans, Willie.
Keep looking.

148
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:36,878
Okay.

149
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:40,744
I'll go out the back way, if you don't mind.

150
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:44,554
Any of the boys spotted me
coming up here, Id be in a real jam.

151
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,559
- Did you get anything out of Willie?
- A blank.

152
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:51,963
This will cheer you up, Phil.
Spectrograph of dirt from the tunnel.

153
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,026
Spectrograph of dust deposits
taken from the dead man's clothes.

154
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:58,005
There's no doubt about it.
They're identical. It all adds up...

155
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:01,702
and places our friend in the morgue
right smack at the scene of the crime.

156
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,107
Looks like we're in business.

157
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,177
From Washington.

158
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,877
"Have no fingerprint record dead man."

159
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,854
That's one I never expected.
Dead man, dead end.

160
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:22,659
"But prints on cellophane
of cigarette package...

161
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,258
"belong Giovanni 'Cotton' Valenti...

162
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,132
"known member, Jarrett gang."

163
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:34,536
And I thought
you were never gonna talk, baby.

164
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,967
- Where's Ma?
- She went to the market.

165
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,563
- Which one?
- She don't tell me those details.

166
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,267
What difference does it make?

167
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:44,108
I'll tell you what difference it makes.
They've got Zuckie in a morgue upstate.

168
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:46,272
The T-men tied him in with us
on the tunnel job.

169
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,942
- What?
- Yeah. We're all as hot as pistols.

170
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:52,612
l don't know how they did it.
Somebody must have tipped them.

171
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:56,215
It's always "somebody tipped them,"
never "the cops are smart."

172
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,021
We had enough food for the week.
Why did she go out?

173
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:03,597
You like strawberries, don't you?
Well, she just had to get some for her boy.

174
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,052
Evans speaking.

175
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:39,559
Her car is parked outside pointing west.

176
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:41,603
Good. I'll be down there right away.

177
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,400
There'll be a marker on the rear bumper.

178
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,638
That's what I thought, Mr. Evans.

179
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,734
Where Ma goes, Cody goes.

180
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,471
We'll use the A-B-C method.

181
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:26,844
Im B.

182
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,681
I'll keep first position behind suspect
on Arango Blvd.

183
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:33,283
227, you're A.

184
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:35,987
<i>You drive parallel on Lattimer.</i>

185
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:37,318
Okay.

186
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:41,420
323, you're C. The same on Fairchild.

187
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,927
<i>- Got that?
- Okay.</i>

188
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,519
Suspect proceeding dead ahead
on Arango Blvd.

189
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,559
Approaching Bakeman.

190
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:25,103
Suspect turned north on Bakeman.

191
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:30,074
C, pick her up at Fairchild.

192
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:32,807
<i>A will take your position.</i>

193
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:40,446
Got her.

194
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:43,719
Traveling dead ahead on Bakeman,
20 miles an hour.

195
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,325
Suspect turning west on Calhoun.

196
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,860
C, proceed dead ahead.
Take position on the right.

197
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,100
Right.

198
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,866
A, pick her up on Calhoun.

199
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,040
Roger.

200
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:13,847
Got her.
Going due west about 30 miles per hour.

201
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,548
Hold the phone.

202
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:20,387
She's turning left on Cling.

203
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:22,627
Let her go.

204
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,758
C, cut over fast to Arango.

205
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:28,665
<i>- Cover her on the left.
- Okay.</i>

206
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:31,331
A, proceed dead ahead.

207
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,174
I'll pick her up when she crosses Fairchild.

208
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,214
Get around it.

209
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,568
A, C, cut into Fairchild. I've lost her.

210
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,103
Down there.

211
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,583
- Come in, C.
- That's a dead spot.

212
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:19,779
It would be. Turn around. We'll go back.

213
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,362
Hold it.

214
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,146
Come in, A.

215
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:48,782
Come in, C.

216
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:53,076
- Beat it up the hill and call the others.
- You're not tackling him alone.

217
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,555
I'll just keep an eye on him. Hurry.

218
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,961
What's the use of having money
if you gotta run...

219
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:05,022
every time somebody sees a shadow?

220
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,399
It's just a feeling I had.
l could have been wrong.

221
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:10,102
Your hunches are never wrong, Ma.

222
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,663
We'll leave the sedan,
the car they're looking for.

223
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,175
You bring the bags and I'll get the coupe.

224
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:29,015
You're not going anywhere, Jarrett.
Put your hands up where I can see them.

225
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:39,299
Get those bags in, and get in fast!

226
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,849
Down the highway, Ernie.

227
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:23,130
Happens every night. Ruins the movie.

228
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,275
Peanuts. Popcorn.

229
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,352
Kill that.

230
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:48,256
This is great.
Where do we go after the second feature?

231
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,026
You're staying put.
Im the only one going anyplace.

232
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,061
- Where, Cody?
- Gonna give myself up.

233
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,968
What are you talking about?
You haven't a chance.

234
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,132
Four dead. It's the gas chamber for sure.

235
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:03,143
You think Im dumb enough
to give myself up to the T-men?

236
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:06,772
What's the difference? You walk into
the cops and they turn you over.

237
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:08,781
Remember a guy named Scratch Morton?

238
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,916
Yeah. The guy on the lam from Illinois.
You had a talk with him one night.

239
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,546
- That's the one.
- I remember.

240
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,582
Knocked over a hotel payroll
in Springfield?

241
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,353
The night we pulled the tunnel job. Handy?

242
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:23,624
Talk plain, son.

243
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:27,168
l pulled that Springfield heist,
not Scratch Morton.

244
00:26:27,235 --> 00:26:31,069
Im going to Illinois and take a state rap.
I'll get two years at the most.

245
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:34,037
They'll still be waiting for you
for the tunnel job.

246
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:35,474
What tunnel job?

247
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:38,569
While those hoodlums were killing
innocent people on the train...

248
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:41,241
l was pushing in a hotel in Springfield.

249
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,278
Couldn't be in both places at once, could l?

250
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,014
Little thing I cooked up
before the tunnel job.

251
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:49,318
You're the smartest there is.

252
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:53,994
Sure, it's smart, but what about me?
What do I do for the next two years?

253
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,962
The same as you did
before he married you.

254
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:00,366
You better not, baby. I'll be back.

255
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:03,932
I'll be waiting for you, honey.
You can trust me.

256
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:06,601
lf the T-men pick you up,
you don't know a thing.

257
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,337
You haven't seen me in months.
Ma, you do all the talking.

258
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:13,313
- I can handle them.
- Verna, you cry a little, like you're sad.

259
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,048
How are you going to make it to Illinois?

260
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,246
Private plane. Don't worry.

261
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:23,554
Goodbye.

262
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,154
Be kind of a break to get rid
of me for a while, won't it?

263
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,561
I'll be around, Cody.

264
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,207
l told you,
l was just trying to cheer up Verna.

265
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:43,608
She's been lonesome all this time,
missing Cody so much.

266
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,771
So I went to the market
to buy her things for a real spread.

267
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,147
Thought it'd make her feel better.
That so, Verna?

268
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:55,053
Yet as soon as you returned
to the auto court, you left again. Why?

269
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:58,317
'Cause we decided to go
to a movie instead.

270
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:01,123
- What theater?
- San Val Drive In.

271
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,528
<i>- What picture?
- Task Force.</i>

272
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,592
Exciting. Verna liked it a lot.

273
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:10,195
- Cody like it?
- How could he?

274
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:14,172
l told you.
Cody hasn't been in California for months.

275
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:17,370
l suppose he shot me
all the way from another state.

276
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:21,211
What makes you think he shot you?
Lots of people have guns.

277
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,910
l was as close to him as I am to you.

278
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,317
Anybody else see him?

279
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,786
Just you. And his wife.

280
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:34,286
Of course, being an old woman,
l wouldn't know much about the law...

281
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:38,799
but I hear you got to have witnesses
to make anything stand up in court.

282
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:43,367
You see Cody last night, Verna?

283
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,533
Makes you the only one,
Mr. Evans, doesn't it?

284
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:50,510
Seems to. lf Cody's
been out of California for months...

285
00:28:50,578 --> 00:28:54,708
l suppose he couldn't have engineered
that train robbery six weeks ago.

286
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:59,380
Im not going to sit here and hear you
accuse my boy without proof.

287
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:03,457
Besides, I know my rights.
You can't keep us here.

288
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,851
You got nothing on us.

289
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:08,828
All right, Mrs. Jarrett, that'll be all now.

290
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:11,193
That's better. Come on, Verna.

291
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:14,966
Stop crying. Nobody's going to hurt you.

292
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,055
<i>Mr. Fallon just arrived from the airport.</i>

293
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,825
Send him right in.

294
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,697
Hello, Phil. How's the arm?

295
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,203
I'll live. Hey, you're looking good.

296
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:52,466
It's that prison diet.
Great chef in San Quentin.

297
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,666
l hated to leave.

298
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,333
You did a whale of a job.

299
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,901
Most talkative con
l ever shared a cell with.

300
00:29:57,979 --> 00:30:02,075
That whole syndicate comes up for trial
in a few weeks. Now, what's that?

301
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:06,176
You put it on a pole,
wind a spool of silk thread around it...

302
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:08,017
and you hold the pole over the water.

303
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:11,024
Then you sit under a nice, shady tree
and relax.

304
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:15,791
After a while, a hungry fish comes along,
nips at your hook, and you've got dinner.

305
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:18,355
For the next two weeks,
l won't think about anything...

306
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:21,163
except the eternal struggle
between man and the fish.

307
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:24,337
I've been promised a vacation.
You remember?

308
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,498
Sorry, Hank, that's out.

309
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:32,268
Phil, look at me. College degree,
lovable personality...

310
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,177
and I spend most of my time in prison.

311
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,150
An undercover specialist.
Eight sentences in five years.

312
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:39,209
Dannemora, Sing Sing, Leavenworth...

313
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,812
l joined the department
to put criminals behind bars...

314
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,949
and here I am, stir crazy.

315
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,559
Read this.

316
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,340
Who checks confessions in Springfield?

317
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,072
Every rookie knows Scratch Morton
went underground after that hotel job.

318
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:07,979
You won't let Jarrett get away
with a two-bit prison stretch?

319
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,277
- Maybe?
- Maybe?

320
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,446
A hoodlum turns himself in
on a phony rap...

321
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,283
and beats the gas chamber.

322
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:17,483
I'll bet you he's thumbing his nose
at Uncle Sam now and loving it.

323
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,049
Jarrett outsmarted you.

324
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,120
That's just what we want him to think.
We're working with the Springfield police.

325
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:25,995
We arranged for the confession to check.
So, what happens?

326
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:29,035
Jarrett does a stretch in the penitentiary.

327
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:31,469
In case he's lonely,
wants to talk to someone...

328
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:35,600
we'll let one of our boys do a stretch
right in the same cell.

329
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,338
Still going fishing, Hank?

330
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:41,507
Yeah. In what prison?

331
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,551
You'll enjoy the food there.
Wonderful chef.

332
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:46,712
- Arrested him myself.
- Okay, what's the pitch?

333
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:49,052
You'll be committed
to the penitentiary in Illinois.

334
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,715
You'll be one of Jarrett's cellmates.

335
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:52,282
Stick with him until you find out...

336
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,227
where he unloaded $300,000
in federal currency...

337
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:57,491
without a single bill showing up.

338
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:01,160
Also, try to learn the identity
of the very special fence...

339
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:03,294
that engineered this deal.

340
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,407
How does he operate?

341
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:09,339
Buys stolen money here,
30, 40 on the dollar.

342
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,278
Peddles it on the European black market
for who knows how much.

343
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:16,306
No questions asked. Sweet racket.

344
00:32:17,318 --> 00:32:18,785
In step with the times.

345
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,252
That's your assignment.

346
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:22,516
l wouldn't ask you to do
another undercover job...

347
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,683
if we weren't up against it.

348
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:28,661
Hello, Hank. Prison records from Illinois.
Your new buddies.

349
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:32,593
Busy little place, isn't it?
2,700 of the roughest and toughest.

350
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,795
A few who might recognize you.
Let's go to work.

351
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,271
- Find another old client?
- Yeah. Red Draper.

352
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,640
Questioned him in '46
about a warehouse job.

353
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:49,379
That makes two for transfer.
Better run through the arrest once more.

354
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:52,651
I'll be picked up at a joint
known as Tom's Hideaway.

355
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,347
Bill's Hideaway.

356
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:56,356
On what seems
like an ordinary hood roundup.

357
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:58,756
Im spotted as a lamister.
l make a break for it.

358
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:01,556
When I pick myself off the floor,
Im meek as a baby.

359
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:04,291
- How do I get information out to you?
- Visiting days.

360
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:05,958
Mother again?

361
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:07,467
Wife this time.

362
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:11,894
One thing though. This time,
get me somebody with a good memory.

363
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:14,441
l had a lot of trouble with my "mother"
in San Quentin.

364
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:18,206
This time, we'll get you a girl in the bureau
who's a memory expert.

365
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,837
Im partial to blondes.

366
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:23,350
Well, who isn't? As soon as I pick her,
I'll send you a picture.

367
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:26,146
- We move this guy.
- Who is he?

368
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,848
Bo Creel. Arrested him two years ago.

369
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:36,494
Wait a minute.
We don't have to worry about him.

370
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:40,193
Finishes his stretch Saturday.
He'll be out before you're sentenced.

371
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,032
Good. Bo Creel would know me
in the dark.

372
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:47,099
This job isn't going to be
like any of the others, Hank.

373
00:33:47,408 --> 00:33:50,138
You see, there's insanity in the Jarretts.

374
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:53,942
Some of it rubbed off on Cody.
His father died in an institution.

375
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:57,214
I've had a few strange cellmates
in my time...

376
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,877
but this sounds like the jackpot.

377
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,654
When he was a kid,
he used to fake headaches...

378
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:05,454
to get his mother's attention away
from the rest of the family. It worked.

379
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:08,427
As he grew up,
the fancied headaches became real...

380
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:10,623
until now they tear him to pieces.

381
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,930
Any minute, he's apt to crack open
at the seams.

382
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:16,993
There goes our case.
So you'll be working against time.

383
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,129
Suits me. Quicker the better.

384
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,038
Except that Cody's not easy
to get close to in a hurry.

385
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:26,541
The only person he's ever cared about
or trusted is his mother.

386
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,378
No one else has ever made a dent,
not even his wife.

387
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:32,445
His mother's been the prop
that's held him up.

388
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,580
He's got a fierce psychopathic devotion
for her.

389
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,521
All his life, whenever he got in a spot...

390
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,891
he just put out his hand,
and there was Ma Jarrett.

391
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,291
Without her, maybe Cody'd...
Just like his old man.

392
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,528
You mean Im supposed to take
mama's place?

393
00:34:48,603 --> 00:34:51,367
Never can tell. He might need someone.

394
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:54,465
I'll practice up on my lullabies.
Nothing else here.

395
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:57,006
Good. Let's run through
your background again.

396
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:59,410
Born Detroit, March 23, 1919.

397
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:03,280
State reform school, 1934, vandalism.

398
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,917
Arrested: suspicion, grand larceny,
Portland, 1939.

399
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:08,012
Good.

400
00:35:08,122 --> 00:35:11,319
<i>The State of Illinois v. Arthur Cody Jarrett.</i>

401
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:14,318
Arthur Cody Jarrett,
on your own admission...

402
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:18,991
you have been convicted of the robbery
of the Palace Hotel on October 12.

403
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,964
It is now my duty to pronounce sentence.

404
00:35:22,303 --> 00:35:25,932
For the crime of grand larceny,
you are hereby sentenced to serve...

405
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:28,737
not less than one
and not more than three years...

406
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,869
in the state penitentiary.

407
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,913
<i>The State of Illinois v. Victor Pardo.</i>

408
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:38,479
How is he? Tough?

409
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:58,029
With Big Ed giving the orders now,
there'll be all kinds of fireworks.

410
00:35:58,105 --> 00:36:01,404
He's got plans that'll make
the old Jarrett mob look like a...

411
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,340
Can you read him?

412
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,374
Yeah.

413
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:13,785
Parker moves his lips pretty good.
It's about Big Ed.

414
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:16,449
What'd he say?

415
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,055
He's the number one boy now,
Parker says.

416
00:36:20,127 --> 00:36:22,027
In more ways than one.

417
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:27,966
- What was that crack?
- I couldn't read him, Cody.

418
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:31,402
- Was that about my wife?
- Honest, he had his mouth covered.

419
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:33,667
Maybe a kick in his skull
would do him some good.

420
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:38,368
They got rules in this chicken coop. You
start anything, you'll wind up in a hole.

421
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,644
Did I ask you for any advice?
Look, Pardo, I've been watching you...

422
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:45,811
and up till now, you haven't done
anything I can put my finger on.

423
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,149
Maybe that's what bothers me.

424
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:49,712
l don't know you,
and what I don't know, I don't trust.

425
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,691
To me, you're a face and a number,
and let's keep it that way.

426
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,557
When I want your help, I'll ask for it.

427
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,494
Have it your way, Cody.

428
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:58,088
<i>Attention, men.</i>

429
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:01,902
<i>The following new men report
to the dispensary for shots:</i>

430
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,995
<i>Abbott, Jordan, Bacon, Pardo, Butler...</i>

431
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:08,132
<i>Jenkins, Jarrett, Williams, Phillips.</i>

432
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:12,378
Hughes, Russell.

433
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:15,608
Keep it moving, boys. No talking.

434
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:16,911
Well, if it ain't Bo Creel.

435
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:20,511
Boys in L.A. had a coming-out party.
It was planned for you a month ago.

436
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:22,954
Im packing, and bang,
flat on my back with pneumonia.

437
00:37:23,024 --> 00:37:24,889
The doc's checking me out today.

438
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,358
See you in eight years.

439
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:28,520
Hyde, Frank.

440
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:32,430
- Keep moving, boys. No talking.
- Jacoby, George.

441
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,967
All right, move up.

442
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,632
Jarrett, Arthur Cody.

443
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,998
Im leaving tomorrow, Cody.

444
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:46,012
- Anything I can do for you on the coast?
- Yeah, look up Big Ed.

445
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,675
- Tell him I was asking for him.
- Johnson, Bate.

446
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,685
Holden, John.

447
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:56,222
Get the lead out.

448
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,281
Coon, Fred.

449
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,959
Scared, sonny?

450
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:08,795
Break it up over there.

451
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:12,572
Who's that reindeer?

452
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,612
l didn't do nothing. He's nuts.

453
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,876
A couple months in solitary
will cool you off, bugger.

454
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:28,577
Fisher.

455
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:33,460
Maddox. Pardo.

456
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:37,054
Im awfully sorry, my good man.
But Mr. Pardo is still on vacation.

457
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:38,428
His month's up today.

458
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:40,626
It is, huh? That's cozy.

459
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:42,760
Look at what they left out of this one.

460
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:45,565
It must have been a lulu
before the warden got it.

461
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,106
- Hey, Herbert.
- Yeah.

462
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:49,074
Any chance you get, read Pardo, will you?

463
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:51,008
- Why?
- Read him.

464
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:53,872
Maybe on visiting days.
That's when they loosen up.

465
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,439
What do you have against him, Cody?
Pardo's all right.

466
00:38:56,517 --> 00:38:58,781
Didn't I check his record
up at the dispensary?

467
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:01,845
That's only a record.
What else do we know about him?

468
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:06,887
Maybe that envelope
will tell us something.

469
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:08,929
Think you ought to? That's U.S. mail.

470
00:39:08,996 --> 00:39:10,190
Im a U.S. citizen, ain't l?

471
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,959
Not lately.

472
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:18,630
Wife. Kid don't talk much.

473
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:21,675
When you're married,
you don't get a chance to. Nice.

474
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:27,344
We'll put it right over here
where we can see it.

475
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,246
He'll know we've been in his mail.

476
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:30,783
All right. So he'll know.

477
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:33,718
Be a nice surprise
when he gets out of solitary.

478
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:46,290
Hi, kid.

479
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:49,427
Let me shake the hand
that slugged Roy Parker.

480
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:52,333
Why did you do it, Pardo?

481
00:39:52,673 --> 00:39:54,937
You know they got rules in this joint,
don't you?

482
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,445
Yeah. Maybe I didn't want
to get my shots.

483
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:10,347
l guess his eyes ain't so good
after solitary.

484
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,749
All right, what's the gag?

485
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:30,770
What's she done to herself?

486
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,978
Had the best-looking blonde I ever saw.
When my back's turned, she's a brunette.

487
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:36,880
Don't even look like her anymore.

488
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:38,316
Maybe she's hot.

489
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,110
Whenever I changed my hair,
so did my missis.

490
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,918
She better be a blonde
when I get out of here.

491
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:52,124
Yeah. Too bad your little trick
didn't work, Pardo.

492
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:57,560
Doc says you got
to take your shots anyway.

493
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,376
Yeah, Benny.

494
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:29,499
Parker's shooting his mouth off again.
Told Benny your boys pulled a caper.

495
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:32,464
- How much did they get?
- $57,000.

496
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:35,808
- Are you in for any of it?
- Full share.

497
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:37,002
No kidding?

498
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:41,604
What's being in here got to do with it?
They're his boys. What they get, he gets.

499
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,445
Yeah. Ma sees to that.

500
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,916
Get one thing clear, all of you.

501
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,221
Anything we get...

502
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:57,387
Cody's in for his full share.

503
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:58,829
That's how it is.

504
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,663
Anyone thinks different...

505
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,461
say so now...

506
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:06,062
or would you rather wait
till Cody gets out?

507
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,869
Well, any argument?

508
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:15,515
Het? Cotton? Happy? Ed?

509
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:18,885
How come, Big Ed?

510
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:21,485
You're the one I expected to give trouble.

511
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:23,284
Fair is fair.

512
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:26,485
We aren't gonna forget Cody
after all he did for us.

513
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:29,556
Cody'll be real grateful to you.

514
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:32,624
Where do you think you're going?

515
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,524
To pick strawberries.

516
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,862
All right, boys, beat it. It's getting late.

517
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:42,132
Het, tell Verna I want her back in here.

518
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:58,423
- What's eating you, sugar?
- You and your big ideas.

519
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,289
That's all they are. Ideas.

520
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,588
"You and me belong together, sugar.
Just leave it to Big Ed."

521
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,962
Im sick of waiting
for you to make your move.

522
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:10,561
You're as scared of Cody as any of them.
He's still Mr. Big, in prison or out.

523
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:14,230
- What makes you think so?
- You. Fair is fair, is it?

524
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:17,840
That's quite a beef you put up
about Cody being in on the cut.

525
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:20,709
See, a guy who thinks his pals
are taking care of him...

526
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:21,907
he gets kind of careless.

527
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:23,472
What does that mean?

528
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,051
Alive, Cody gets out
in one, two years, maybe.

529
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:29,350
Dead, he gets out sooner.

530
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:33,115
Dead?

531
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:36,457
Right now, he's a sitting duck
up there in that pen.

532
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:39,925
He's rubbing elbows with a guy
that does anything I say.

533
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:43,595
When, Ed?

534
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,171
When I say so.

535
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:13,998
Where's Pardo?

536
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:28,313
You know all about radios.
Maybe you can fix the warden's.

537
00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:31,545
- I'll fix it so it blows up in his face.
- Suits me.

538
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,951
Come on. Back to your places.
Go ahead. Get on back there.

539
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:46,589
Are you hurt, Jarrett?

540
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,255
No. Things were getting
kind of dull around here, anyway.

541
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,457
Back to your work. You, too, Pardo.

542
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:59,170
- The lever slipped.
- You can tell that to the warden later.

543
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:01,502
l saw that just in time.

544
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:03,304
What do you want? A medal?

545
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:05,402
You would have looked like that barrel.

546
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:08,373
You almost walked into it yourself.

547
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:11,612
Why should you care
if a guy named Cody Jarrett gets his...

548
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,516
if you don't want something?

549
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,186
Okay. Keep your medal.

550
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,257
Come on, break it up. Get going, Jarrett.

551
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,977
Sorry, Cody.

552
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,179
Forget it, Parker.

553
00:46:41,615 --> 00:46:43,515
Accidents will happen.

554
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,413
<i>Attention. The following men
have visitors.</i>

555
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:49,747
<i>Reynolds, Allen, Jarrett, Kaminsky...</i>

556
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:52,223
<i>Williams, Phillips, Jordan.</i>

557
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,267
Hello, Ma.

558
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:06,735
Cody. You been hurt.

559
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,307
- Oh, it's nothing. Just an accident.
- You sure?

560
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:13,408
What kind of question is that?
Why are you nervous? Anything wrong?

561
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,176
- Plenty.
- Like what?

562
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:18,144
That's why I come.

563
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:20,314
Im the one to tell you.

564
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,685
It's Big Ed and Verna. They run out.

565
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:27,452
It's my fault, Cody. I let you down.

566
00:47:27,794 --> 00:47:30,285
l said Id take care of things
and I let you down.

567
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:34,865
l saw it coming,
but I didn't think he'd have the guts.

568
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,766
Forget it, Ma.

569
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:39,431
It was in the cards
for Big Ed to make his try.

570
00:47:39,506 --> 00:47:40,996
Don't you care?

571
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,874
Sure. What's mine is mine,
but I ain't gonna let it make me sick.

572
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:47,437
I'll take care of them when I get out.

573
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:51,143
That's what I told myself.
I'll help you, Cody, like always.

574
00:47:51,752 --> 00:47:55,017
You'll be out soon,
back on top of the world.

575
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,780
When you're around, Ma,
nothing can stop me.

576
00:47:57,858 --> 00:47:58,847
That's right.

577
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:03,087
Only you got to be careful about Big Ed.

578
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:06,757
lf I know Big Ed, right now he's doing
enough worrying for the both of us.

579
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,194
Maybe not.

580
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:13,063
Can't expect me to come looking for him.

581
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,835
That's what Im getting at.

582
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:16,603
When you get out...

583
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:19,407
he knows his life
isn't worth a plugged nickel.

584
00:48:20,714 --> 00:48:24,480
When a tinhorn like that thinks
he's big enough to take your place...

585
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,683
he's got to feel pretty safe.

586
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,989
Now, all of a sudden, he makes his move...

587
00:48:30,857 --> 00:48:33,655
like he was sure
you'd never get out of here...

588
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:35,319
except in a box.

589
00:48:38,098 --> 00:48:40,089
l see what you mean.

590
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,263
You said it was an accident?

591
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,167
For a minute, I thought it was.

592
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:45,636
How'd it happen?

593
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:48,104
A pal of Big Ed's dropped something.

594
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,735
You see, Cody? I was right.

595
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:52,634
He was figuring you'd be dead.

596
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:56,675
Relax, Ma. Im still here, ain't l?

597
00:48:56,947 --> 00:48:59,939
lf he tried it once, he'll try it again.

598
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:04,442
I'll still walk out of this joint,
and then I'll take care of Big Ed.

599
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:08,321
And let him live that long? No, Cody.

600
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:10,789
I'll take care of Big Ed.

601
00:49:11,528 --> 00:49:13,223
No, Ma. You won't have a chance.

602
00:49:13,297 --> 00:49:17,324
Any time I can't handle his kind,
I'll know Im getting old.

603
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:20,967
No one does what he's done to you, son,
and gets away with it.

604
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:23,472
No, Ma. Look, listen to me.
You won't have a chance.

605
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:27,567
Im going after him to keep him
from having you knocked off here.

606
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:30,938
- Im telling you, don't do it.
- Goodbye, Cody.

607
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:32,204
Ma!

608
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,851
Keep your hands off that wire.

609
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:03,074
What's the matter, Parker?

610
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,214
l ain't going to do anything.

611
00:50:05,682 --> 00:50:06,842
Not now.

612
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:09,578
Im going to let you stay awake nights...

613
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:10,881
sweat it out.

614
00:50:11,255 --> 00:50:13,985
Then when I get ready, good and ready...

615
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:16,291
I'll pay you back.

616
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:22,425
<i>I'll take care of Big Ed.</i>

617
00:50:24,801 --> 00:50:26,928
<i>I'll take care of him, Cody.</i>

618
00:50:58,168 --> 00:50:59,863
What's the matter, Cody?

619
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,573
My head.

620
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,108
Cover for me.

621
00:51:06,944 --> 00:51:08,036
Watch it.

622
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:16,109
Fingers are kind of thick today.

623
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:19,452
No doctors.

624
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:22,651
It's all right now. He's gone.

625
00:51:22,726 --> 00:51:25,126
- Where's the pain?
- It's right here.

626
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:33,962
Don't let it beat you.
You are a top man, aren't you?

627
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:36,096
Since I was a kid,
I've been reading about you.

628
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:38,004
Always hoping I could join up with you.

629
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:42,068
You don't want to let those two-bit mugs
see Cody Jarrett on his knees.

630
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:43,305
Come on.

631
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:51,242
- You all right, Cody?
- Yeah.

632
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:55,507
- Just can't sleep, that's all.
- That headache gone?

633
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:57,847
- Yeah.
- Then why can't you sleep?

634
00:53:03,026 --> 00:53:05,927
It's Ma. She's walking into trouble.

635
00:53:06,396 --> 00:53:08,694
- Anything I can do?
- No.

636
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:13,933
Yeah. Maybe there is, kid.

637
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:21,069
For a while, I figured out
that sitting out this penny-ante stretch...

638
00:53:21,144 --> 00:53:23,408
would be a kind of vacation...

639
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,710
take the heat off me for another job.

640
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:30,445
Sometimes you make plans,
sometimes they don't work out.

641
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:34,453
Then you got to get doing and fast,
you understand?

642
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:42,064
- I got business on the outside.
- Going to crash out?

643
00:53:42,866 --> 00:53:45,733
Yeah. Want to come along?

644
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:49,033
Maybe I do. Did you tell anybody else?

645
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:01,843
Figured on cutting in Tommy Ryley.

646
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:05,853
Then you'll have to cut in 10 more.
Why do you want Ryley?

647
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:08,153
He's got a gun stashed.

648
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:10,682
Don't need a gun.

649
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:13,425
They're not gonna open the gates for us.

650
00:54:15,065 --> 00:54:17,829
You think you're the only guy
in this paw that wants out?

651
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:20,369
What do you think
I've been dreaming about nights?

652
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:23,838
l got a way to get a mile from here
before anybody knows what hit them.

653
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:26,034
Without artillery, it can't be done.

654
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:30,713
No? Listen, Im a pretty handy fella
with electricity, you remember?

655
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:34,443
Well, I figured a way to fix the generators.

656
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:36,483
You know what that means?

657
00:54:37,788 --> 00:54:39,221
l have a slight idea.

658
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:43,885
The generators control everything:
searchlights, gun turret, main gate.

659
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:46,091
Who needs artillery?

660
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:49,329
Only we got to do it alone.

661
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,862
We're going to need a car.

662
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:56,864
My wife's coming tomorrow.
We'll set it all up.

663
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:04,909
All right, kid. It's a deal...

664
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:08,917
and if it works, I'll pay you back.

665
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:12,814
Maybe you'll give me that medal.

666
00:55:14,624 --> 00:55:16,091
Solid gold.

667
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:40,211
Good news for you, Herbert.

668
00:55:40,283 --> 00:55:42,683
You've had good news
for the last 12 years.

669
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:45,482
Im working on a plan
to get your case reviewed.

670
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,485
- Hello, Margaret.
- You're looking well, Vic.

671
00:55:52,796 --> 00:55:56,095
We're being watched.
Say anything you like and make it good.

672
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,793
Listen to me carefully.

673
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:01,102
Divorce? Vic, you can't mean that.

674
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:02,729
Why? What have I done?

675
00:56:03,006 --> 00:56:04,701
That's fine.

676
00:56:05,242 --> 00:56:07,870
Jarrett's getting out of here
and Im going with him.

677
00:56:08,545 --> 00:56:12,641
l know how you feel, but don't ask me
to do anything that'll break my heart.

678
00:56:13,683 --> 00:56:15,480
It might be better for you.

679
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:18,613
It's my life.
Let me decide what to do with it.

680
00:56:18,688 --> 00:56:21,179
Just the two of us.

681
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:24,449
Tell Evans we'll break out Thursday night.

682
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,597
Tell him to plant a getaway car
with an oscillator.

683
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:32,663
Can you remember that?
With an oscillator.

684
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:34,696
I'll remember, darling.

685
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:39,369
- Everything clear?
- Perfectly clear.

686
00:56:41,478 --> 00:56:45,539
You won't be sorry, Vic. When you get out,
we'll be happy. I'll see to that.

687
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:48,982
Nice. Where'd you learn all that?
Soap opera?

688
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:51,178
How did you know?

689
00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:54,079
This time Im going right
to the top to get you out.

690
00:56:54,157 --> 00:56:57,092
- Herbert, are you listening?
- Sure, Jerry.

691
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,220
But if that fails,
you'll have to serve the rest of your term.

692
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:04,491
Jerry, you couldn't get me out of here
if I was pardoned.

693
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,260
All right, this is the prison.

694
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:10,999
We place the getaway car in these trees...

695
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:14,407
with the oscillator under its rear axle
and hooked up to the battery.

696
00:57:14,477 --> 00:57:18,174
Our cars will be parked here, a mile or so
away, one here and the other here.

697
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:21,910
We assume that Jarrett and Hank
come out here somewhere.

698
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:24,317
They pile into the getaway car,
and they're off.

699
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:25,547
- You ready, Ernie?
- Ready.

700
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:28,216
The transmitter wavelength is 47.1.

701
00:57:29,292 --> 00:57:31,021
47.1.

702
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:33,123
All right. Switch it on.

703
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:39,196
Our receivers pick up that sound
from the oscillator...

704
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:42,568
which enables us to cross-plot
their exact position.

705
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:44,401
For example...

706
00:57:45,842 --> 00:57:48,777
suppose the impulse received here...

707
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:51,575
has a bearing of 210 degrees.

708
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:55,409
This one here reads 45 degrees.

709
00:57:56,086 --> 00:57:57,781
We plot them like so.

710
00:57:57,954 --> 00:58:00,514
Where the lines cross,
that's where they are.

711
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:03,592
It doesn't matter how far they travel.

712
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,128
As long as our cars
are within receiving distance...

713
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:07,629
we can tell where they are.

714
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:08,959
Switch it off.

715
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:11,266
How far is receiving distance?

716
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:15,495
We had a dry run on a car yesterday.
Kept tabs on him for 20 miles.

717
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:16,730
That little thing?

718
00:58:16,806 --> 00:58:19,673
You can make one out
of your bedside radio. I'll show you how.

719
00:58:19,743 --> 00:58:23,577
When you've got a week to spare,
Ernie'll tell you all about electronics.

720
00:58:23,646 --> 00:58:28,208
We'll meet at the airport in 40 minutes.
Be in Springfield late this afternoon.

721
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:04,280
Tonight.

722
00:59:36,886 --> 00:59:39,684
Isn't that Lefeld down there? Nat Lefeld?

723
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:44,587
From the coast mob. Came in today.

724
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:46,456
They checked him in today?

725
00:59:47,897 --> 00:59:49,831
Ask him how my mother is.

726
00:59:54,904 --> 00:59:57,270
Ask about Cody's mother.

727
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:11,112
She's dead.

728
01:00:16,392 --> 01:00:17,620
Dead?

729
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:58,663
l want to get out of here!

730
01:00:59,802 --> 01:01:01,599
Get me out!

731
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:32,961
Special for Jarrett.

732
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:35,567
- Hiya, Doc.
- Hi, Ryley.

733
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,839
Hi, Cody. Brought you some grub.

734
01:01:46,115 --> 01:01:47,980
Hot soup made special.

735
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:52,153
How are you, Vic? Glad to see you, kid.
You're a good boy, Vic.

736
01:01:53,122 --> 01:01:54,919
It's me, Tommy Ryley.

737
01:01:55,325 --> 01:01:57,293
That's right, Vic. Play it smart.

738
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,692
Play it smart.
That's the only way it'll work.

739
01:01:59,762 --> 01:02:02,196
Here, get some of this into you.

740
01:02:02,265 --> 01:02:04,392
Next time you come, bring the gun.

741
01:02:05,468 --> 01:02:08,904
l like the way you go about it, Vic.
Bring the gun.

742
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:14,509
You sure you won't try
some of this delicious soup?

743
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:17,307
I'll get it if you take me along, Cody.

744
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:21,709
l don't want any of that slop.

745
01:02:22,585 --> 01:02:26,043
Try it on the warden. It's a deal.

746
01:02:26,656 --> 01:02:29,386
lf you don't want it,
l guess you don't want it.

747
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:31,984
But you gotta keep up your strength, fella.

748
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:35,997
lf the warden don't want it,
try it on the governor.

749
01:02:36,065 --> 01:02:37,930
Guess he ain't hungry.

750
01:02:52,115 --> 01:02:53,844
Dr. Simpson speaking.

751
01:02:54,017 --> 01:02:57,817
Yes, Warden.
I've just finished my report on Jarrett.

752
01:02:57,887 --> 01:03:00,048
Violent, homicidal.

753
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:04,292
He'll probably have recurrent periods
of normal behavior, but...

754
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,920
Yes, sir. Our psychiatrists
are coming tonight.

755
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:09,294
They'll commit him to the institution.

756
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:12,493
Yes, Warden. I suggest
you prepare the release for him.

757
01:03:12,568 --> 01:03:14,229
Thank you, Warden.

758
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:17,030
- Oscillator all ready?
- Ready to sing, Phil.

759
01:03:17,106 --> 01:03:20,303
Put the car in the trees.
We'll pick you up and take our positions.

760
01:03:20,376 --> 01:03:23,174
- Telephone, Mr. Evans.
- All right. Hold it, boys.

761
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:27,743
Evans speaking. Hello, Warden.

762
01:03:30,186 --> 01:03:33,644
That is bad news.
Not altogether a surprise.

763
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:35,588
Thanks for your cooperation anyway,
Warden.

764
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:38,627
Say, by the way, tomorrow
there'll be a pardon coming through...

765
01:03:38,695 --> 01:03:40,788
for one of your inmates, Vic Pardo.

766
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:43,491
Rush it through, will you? Thanks.

767
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:46,831
No dice, boys. The party's off.

768
01:03:46,903 --> 01:03:49,770
Jarrett's a raving maniac.
They've got him in a straitjacket.

769
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,706
It's a good thing for Hank
it happened inside instead of out.

770
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:54,299
It's the only good thing about it.

771
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:55,867
Take the oscillator off the car.

772
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:58,106
I'll get the plane tickets for 10:00 tonight.

773
01:03:58,181 --> 01:04:00,706
You have a car
to take us to the Springfield airport?

774
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:02,512
It'll be there, Mr. Evans.

775
01:04:02,618 --> 01:04:05,610
Sorry, boys. They can't all work out.

776
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:17,093
How would you like
a little change of scenery, Cody?

777
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,528
Someplace where we might be able
to cure your headaches?

778
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,195
You wouldn't mind a little trip, would you?

779
01:04:23,606 --> 01:04:26,404
No. Might do me some good.

780
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,607
- Doctor.
- Not now, Ryley.

781
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:31,412
l want something to eat.

782
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:34,939
- You've sent away two meals already.
- That's why Im hungry now.

783
01:04:35,017 --> 01:04:37,076
Hunger's always a hopeful sign.

784
01:04:43,993 --> 01:04:46,826
Nobody feeds Cody Jarrett.
What am l, a kid?

785
01:04:46,963 --> 01:04:49,557
Is it all right to remove the straitjacket,
Doctor?

786
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:50,894
I'll do it.

787
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:07,144
They got you tied up good.

788
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:19,926
The examination's over.
All right, turn around.

789
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:26,891
Now, keep them quiet.
Doctor, you're with me.

790
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,976
l want you to make
a little phone call for me.

791
01:05:37,046 --> 01:05:40,106
And no slip-ups,
or you're gonna need a doctor.

792
01:05:45,655 --> 01:05:50,024
You're taking a little walk, boys.
Doc wants you in the dispensary.

793
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:00,129
Wait here.

794
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:03,536
- Come on, Parker.
- Where to?

795
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:06,507
Dispensary. Special invitation
to the doctor.

796
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:16,880
Here. Tie and gag him.

797
01:06:24,427 --> 01:06:26,452
Drop that stick. Now.

798
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,788
Get in the cell.

799
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:36,362
All right. Now you two come along
and bring the tuxedo with you.

800
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:40,239
Reader, cover the outside door.

801
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:42,937
We'll not make it this way.
We'll never get to the gate.

802
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:45,344
- Who says so?
- Why me? What do you want with me?

803
01:06:45,414 --> 01:06:48,110
You're my pal. Im taking you with me.
Come on.

804
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:51,316
- Look...
- Get.

805
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,315
You got me wrong.
l got nothing against you.

806
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,325
It was Big Ed. He told me to do it.

807
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:59,527
You wouldn't kill me in cold blood,
would you?

808
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:00,857
I'll let you warm up a little.

809
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,830
There's the fingerprint that nailed me.

810
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:04,992
Psycho, put that zoot suit on him.

811
01:07:05,067 --> 01:07:06,193
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

812
01:07:06,269 --> 01:07:08,294
Cody, my way,
there wouldn't be no shooting.

813
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:09,804
Ain't gonna be any my way either.

814
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:12,340
We're going out of here in a car
like gentlemen on a picnic.

815
01:07:12,408 --> 01:07:15,434
They want me to take a little trip.
We're gonna take a trip.

816
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:18,571
Only it better be a quiet one.
Come on, now. Get.

817
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:21,539
Pick up those hats.

818
01:07:32,728 --> 01:07:34,958
Everybody down. Ryley, get those keys.

819
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,928
You get in the trunk. Come on, get it open.

820
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:41,396
Get in.

821
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,971
Ryley, you get in the front.

822
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:48,676
Reader, get in the back
and make like you're loony.

823
01:07:48,744 --> 01:07:50,644
And you, you drive.

824
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:54,012
You know how jittery I am.
Any minute Im liable to explode.

825
01:08:05,528 --> 01:08:08,588
Now if we don't make it,
I've got six slugs in this gun.

826
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:10,131
One for each of us.

827
01:08:19,275 --> 01:08:21,709
- Dr. Harris.
- Good night, Doc.

828
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:41,821
Hello. Yeah, speaking.

829
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:45,997
What? All right. Right away.

830
01:08:46,068 --> 01:08:48,400
Turn back. Jarrett's busted out.

831
01:08:52,808 --> 01:08:55,641
<i>Black sedan. Probably headed southwest.</i>

832
01:08:55,745 --> 01:08:59,044
<i>Following are the names of the men
who escaped with Cody Jarrett.</i>

833
01:08:59,115 --> 01:09:03,449
<i>Thomas Ryley, Roy Parker,
Michael Curtin, Vic Pardo.</i>

834
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:06,313
<i>Do not shoot unless absolutely necessary.</i>

835
01:09:06,756 --> 01:09:08,348
<i>Hostages in car.</i>

836
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:09,949
<i>Do not shoot...</i>

837
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:12,494
- One break for our boy.
- What's Hank's procedure now?

838
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:15,530
He'll stay with Jarrett
till he gets what he's after.

839
01:09:22,672 --> 01:09:25,232
l like your tailor. How do you like mine?

840
01:09:26,175 --> 01:09:29,008
Tommy, rustle up some grub.
You, in there.

841
01:09:32,848 --> 01:09:35,043
Vic, what's taking you so long?

842
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:37,817
Trying to find some more artillery.

843
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:41,555
- Let it ring.
- Someone might get suspicious.

844
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:49,720
Come on.

845
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:06,440
How you doing, Parker?

846
01:10:06,515 --> 01:10:09,143
It's stuffy in here. I need some air.

847
01:10:09,218 --> 01:10:12,187
Stuffy, huh? I'll give you a little air.

848
01:10:46,956 --> 01:10:49,015
<i>No clue to their movements
has been reported...</i>

849
01:10:49,091 --> 01:10:51,525
<i>since their assault last night
on a service station...</i>

850
01:10:51,594 --> 01:10:53,084
<i>north of Gallup, New Mexico.</i>

851
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:55,756
<i>It is assumed now
by federal law enforcement agencies...</i>

852
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:59,699
<i>that Jarrett and the other escaped
convicts are heading for California.</i>

853
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:04,736
<i>This concludes the nightly news summary
from KFKL, San Bernardino.</i>

854
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:32,061
Did you check the windows?

855
01:11:35,004 --> 01:11:38,098
- I said, "Did you check the windows?"
- Ed, let's get out of here.

856
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:41,632
Take it easy, baby.
We're ready for him when he comes.

857
01:11:42,077 --> 01:11:46,343
l can't stand another night, Ed.
Listening, going crazy.

858
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:50,243
It ain't like waiting for some human being
who wants to kill you.

859
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:51,684
Cody ain't human.

860
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:54,253
Fill him full of lead,
and he'll still come at you.

861
01:11:54,323 --> 01:11:56,883
Plug him and he drops,
same as anybody else.

862
01:11:56,959 --> 01:11:58,722
The boys didn't think so.

863
01:11:58,794 --> 01:12:01,490
Why did they beat it down to San Berdoo?

864
01:12:01,797 --> 01:12:04,163
'Cause they know this is
between me and Cody.

865
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:07,201
- They'll be back when it's over.
- You'll be dead.

866
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:14,398
Maybe so.

867
01:12:14,977 --> 01:12:18,913
But the time comes when a man's
gotta stop running away and face things.

868
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:21,010
Or else go on running for good.

869
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:23,881
All right, throw your life away.
Stay here and shoot it out.

870
01:12:23,953 --> 01:12:26,046
Me? Im going. I want to live.

871
01:12:26,121 --> 01:12:28,112
Cody might have ideas about that.

872
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:30,715
I'll go someplace he'll never find me.

873
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,187
The world ain't big enough, sugar.

874
01:12:34,663 --> 01:12:37,188
Not when he finds out
what you did to his ma.

875
01:12:45,941 --> 01:12:48,967
- You'd tell him?
- lf you run out on me.

876
01:12:52,648 --> 01:12:55,173
- Why not?
- But I only did it for you, Ed.

877
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,108
She had you covered.

878
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:03,118
Cody still ain't going to like to hear
that she got it in the back.

879
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:09,322
Feel more like staying now?

880
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,342
l said Id be back.

881
01:15:03,946 --> 01:15:05,971
Now tell me you're glad to see me.

882
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:08,949
Only say it low, so nobody can hear.

883
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:16,086
Cody, Im so glad to see you.

884
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,323
I've been praying you'd come back.

885
01:15:18,394 --> 01:15:21,022
l couldn't stand it any longer.
l was running away.

886
01:15:21,096 --> 01:15:22,358
- From Big Ed?
- Yeah.

887
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:24,456
- What's the matter? Don't you like him?
- No.

888
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:27,093
Maybe you shouldn't have teamed up
with him.

889
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:28,534
l couldn't help it, Cody.

890
01:15:28,604 --> 01:15:31,732
He said if I didn't go away with him,
he'd have you killed.

891
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:34,173
All I wanted was for you to come back.

892
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:37,679
That's the truth. I love you, Cody.

893
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:39,111
- You let Ma die?
- No.

894
01:15:39,181 --> 01:15:41,513
You didn't even raise a finger to help her.

895
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,813
You just stood there
and watched Big Ed kill her.

896
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:45,410
l tell you, you got it wrong, Cody.

897
01:15:45,487 --> 01:15:48,854
Maybe you thought it was funny,
an old woman taking on a guy like that.

898
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:51,392
No. I tried to warn her...

899
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:53,824
but he caught me and beat me.

900
01:15:53,896 --> 01:15:56,729
Then when Ma came,
he was waiting for her, and he...

901
01:15:58,033 --> 01:16:00,433
- I can't tell you.
- Tell me.

902
01:16:03,005 --> 01:16:05,064
He got her in the back.

903
01:16:12,548 --> 01:16:14,345
- Is he in there now?
- Yeah.

904
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:18,113
But you gotta be careful, Cody.
He's got the house rigged up like a trap.

905
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:21,581
You can't get in unless I tell you how.

906
01:17:39,134 --> 01:17:41,830
- Ed.
- Stay where you are.

907
01:17:43,338 --> 01:17:46,865
- What was that bell downstairs?
- It was me, Ed.

908
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:53,742
What were you doing down there?

909
01:17:53,815 --> 01:17:56,875
l couldn't go through with it.
l tried, but I couldn't.

910
01:17:57,052 --> 01:17:58,178
Talk sense.

911
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:01,887
l was going to take the car and beat it.
l was scared.

912
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:04,355
But I don't want to go anymore.

913
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:09,453
You're my honey.

914
01:18:17,339 --> 01:18:18,704
Still got nerves?

915
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:25,204
Please, Ed. I feel like a drink.

916
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,581
- Fix me one, too.
- Here.

917
01:19:21,103 --> 01:19:22,297
Catch.

918
01:19:42,824 --> 01:19:45,258
Listen, Cody. Ed said this joint is a cinch.

919
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:47,192
- Good for $50,000.
- Who?

920
01:19:47,296 --> 01:19:50,060
- Big Ed.
- Never heard of him. Go on.

921
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:53,896
The way we had it figured, Cody,
we pile out of the cars here...

922
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:56,494
we slug the guards,
and we grab the payroll here.

923
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:58,664
Blast our way out. It'll all take 50 seconds.

924
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,173
They got cars. They'd follow you.

925
01:20:00,242 --> 01:20:01,675
That's where we use the gas truck.

926
01:20:01,743 --> 01:20:03,142
I'll stall it right in the gates.

927
01:20:03,211 --> 01:20:06,703
And when we beat it in the getaway cars,
l got the truck keys in my pocket.

928
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:08,340
And where do you get the gas truck?

929
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:12,376
We got one stashed behind a barn.
Bought it with our own dough. $12,000.

930
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:15,423
- You bought a gas truck?
- Yeah.

931
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:18,351
What's the matter?
You forget how to steal one?

932
01:20:18,427 --> 01:20:21,294
Maybe it ain't so bad, Cody.
$12,000 gets you $50,000.

933
01:20:21,396 --> 01:20:23,364
Fence $50,000, and you get $20,000.

934
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:26,629
Then what are you going to do with that?
Buy two more gas trucks?

935
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:29,227
That joint has got the serial number
of every bill.

936
01:20:29,304 --> 01:20:31,966
Any guy who says he can fence
$50,000 is crazy.

937
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,669
- The Trader ain't crazy.
- The Trader?

938
01:20:35,777 --> 01:20:39,110
- Who's he?
- My manager, kid.

939
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:42,911
Come on. Let's get a look
at that $12,000 doll.

940
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,816
Cody. My radio ain't working again.

941
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:50,187
Oh, no.

942
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:53,456
What do you want it for,
unemployment insurance?

943
01:20:53,528 --> 01:20:55,962
Can't I go down to San Berdoo
and get it fixed?

944
01:20:56,031 --> 01:20:59,865
Nobody leaves unless I say so. Now, you...

945
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:03,062
What's the matter, baby?

946
01:21:03,338 --> 01:21:04,965
Im not gonna hurt you.

947
01:21:09,244 --> 01:21:11,838
Go and read your comic books. Good girl.

948
01:21:24,593 --> 01:21:26,652
This fellow you call the Trader...

949
01:21:26,728 --> 01:21:28,161
can you trust him?

950
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,288
Why?

951
01:21:29,364 --> 01:21:33,698
l wouldn't like to see my share of a caper
handed to a guy who might disappear.

952
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:35,862
- Suspicious, ain't you?
- Just careful.

953
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:40,135
You don't have to worry about the Trader.
He pays off on the spot in nice, clean bills.

954
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:41,835
Where does he get rid of this stuff?

955
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:46,040
- Ships to Europe. Collects both ends.
- Smart operator.

956
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:49,379
Didn't see any of that dope from
that tunnel job pop up, did you?

957
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:51,385
l like him better now.

958
01:21:59,594 --> 01:22:00,720
Not bad.

959
01:22:01,096 --> 01:22:04,065
Maybe the $12,000
don't go down the drain after all.

960
01:22:07,068 --> 01:22:08,865
- Hey, Het.
- Yeah.

961
01:22:08,937 --> 01:22:10,666
You're pretty good with a blowtorch.

962
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:13,435
You suppose you could cut a hole
in here into the tank?

963
01:22:13,508 --> 01:22:14,634
Yeah, sure.

964
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,673
We're back in business, boys.

965
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:21,341
We're back in business. And not
Big Ed's way either, and not for $50,000.

966
01:22:21,683 --> 01:22:23,275
But first, a question.

967
01:22:23,452 --> 01:22:27,616
Supposing you want to push
in a place like Fort Knox...

968
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:30,157
and grab yourselves
a couple of tons of gold...

969
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:32,352
what's the toughest thing
about a job like that?

970
01:22:32,427 --> 01:22:34,327
Getting inside the joint.

971
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:37,194
A silver dollar
for the gentleman on the balcony.

972
01:22:37,265 --> 01:22:38,391
Right on the button.

973
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:39,491
Getting in.

974
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:43,026
Which brings me to a story Ma
used to tell me when I was a kid.

975
01:22:43,205 --> 01:22:44,797
A story about a horse.

976
01:22:45,607 --> 01:22:50,044
Way back, there was a whole army
trying to knock over a place called Troy...

977
01:22:50,412 --> 01:22:54,007
and getting nowhere fast.
Couldn't even put a dent in the walls.

978
01:22:54,749 --> 01:22:59,049
One morning, the people of Troy wake up,
look over the walls...

979
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,486
and the attacking army disappeared.

980
01:23:02,157 --> 01:23:05,684
Men, boats, the works. Taking a powder.

981
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:08,859
But they left one thing after them...

982
01:23:09,097 --> 01:23:12,032
a great, big wooden horse.

983
01:23:13,468 --> 01:23:14,662
And according to Ma...

984
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:29,744
Hello, there.

985
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:32,252
l was wondering
if I could use your telephone?

986
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,720
There ain't a phone here for five miles.

987
01:23:34,923 --> 01:23:36,550
Im sorry to hear that.

988
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:39,855
- Good morning.
- Hello. Lost your way, mister?

989
01:23:39,928 --> 01:23:41,793
No. I wanted to call my office...

990
01:23:41,863 --> 01:23:44,764
but these gentlemen say
you don't have a phone here.

991
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,729
They wouldn't know. There's one
in the house. I'll show you where it is.

992
01:23:48,803 --> 01:23:50,327
Thank you very much.

993
01:23:53,608 --> 01:23:56,600
There's a call that's gonna cost
more than a nickel.

994
01:23:56,678 --> 01:23:58,669
Looks like Big Ed's gonna have company.

995
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:00,806
And we got a new station wagon.

996
01:24:15,063 --> 01:24:18,089
- How's fishing?
- Fine, Cody.

997
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:21,260
- Good catch.
- You like the truck idea?

998
01:24:21,803 --> 01:24:23,134
It's admirable.

999
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:27,573
We might all profit by a closer study
of classical literature.

1000
01:24:32,347 --> 01:24:35,214
Chemical plant.
l guess that's Long Beach way.

1001
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:37,808
That's close enough for now.
You know the way I work.

1002
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:41,219
l must ask that you don't insist
on knowing the exact location...

1003
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:43,120
until you've reached the rendezvous.

1004
01:24:43,191 --> 01:24:45,819
That's all right.
The only thing that matters is...

1005
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:48,226
how much dough
this joint has in the kitty.

1006
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:53,233
$426,000 will be placed in their safe
before closing time tomorrow...

1007
01:24:53,835 --> 01:24:57,635
to be distributed to deserving
employees the following morning...

1008
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:00,872
provided there's no unforeseen accident,
of course.

1009
01:25:01,743 --> 01:25:04,109
- Like me and my boys?
- Exactly.

1010
01:25:06,281 --> 01:25:07,942
What are they doing, dancing?

1011
01:25:08,016 --> 01:25:10,075
Maybe they found
they went to school together.

1012
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:12,176
Maybe they're buddies after all.

1013
01:25:12,253 --> 01:25:14,448
Something funny's going on there.

1014
01:25:18,126 --> 01:25:20,321
I've had my eye on this place
for several months.

1015
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:24,263
Now, these checking gates,
that means a pass for the driver...

1016
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:27,324
identity cards and stuff. We're all hot.

1017
01:25:27,602 --> 01:25:29,900
Your truck will be driven
past these checkers...

1018
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:32,030
by an ex-convict of my acquaintance.

1019
01:25:32,107 --> 01:25:34,507
He's now leading
a scrupulously honest life...

1020
01:25:34,576 --> 01:25:36,840
as a truck driver for this very firm.

1021
01:25:37,379 --> 01:25:38,346
Smooth.

1022
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:46,084
Sorry to bust in. We're finished out there.
Wanna check?

1023
01:25:46,154 --> 01:25:47,553
I'll be right out.

1024
01:25:48,523 --> 01:25:51,253
- You having much luck, mister?
- I haven't started yet...

1025
01:25:51,326 --> 01:25:52,918
Im just on my way.

1026
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,496
- Done much fishing up here?
- Every year.

1027
01:25:56,164 --> 01:25:58,860
- What are you trying for?
- Bass.

1028
01:26:00,301 --> 01:26:02,861
- This guy's a phony, Cody.
- I beg your pardon?

1029
01:26:02,937 --> 01:26:06,236
This is trout country.
There ain't bass for 100 miles.

1030
01:26:09,911 --> 01:26:11,173
What's so funny?

1031
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:14,238
You're right on your toes, kid. Bass.

1032
01:26:15,183 --> 01:26:16,616
He got you, didn't he?

1033
01:26:16,685 --> 01:26:20,416
Trader, this is the kid I've been telling
you about. Meet Vic Pardo.

1034
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:23,582
- Hello.
- Glad to know you, Mr...

1035
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:24,647
Forgive me, l...

1036
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:28,059
You can forget that.
Vic's my partner, 50-50.

1037
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:30,120
Cody Jarrett going 50-50?

1038
01:26:30,265 --> 01:26:33,701
- I split even with Ma, didn't l?
- I see.

1039
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:37,838
My name's Daniel Winston.
San Diego. Securities.

1040
01:26:38,206 --> 01:26:40,140
Glad to know you, Mr. Winston.

1041
01:26:41,142 --> 01:26:42,404
Sit down.

1042
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,150
Hold it. Where you going, Pardo?

1043
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:25,342
- What's doing, kid?
- I don't like being pushed around.

1044
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:27,354
My orders was nobody was to leave.

1045
01:27:27,422 --> 01:27:30,823
That might go for hoods like him.
When I got a reason to leave, I leave.

1046
01:27:30,892 --> 01:27:32,917
Nobody has any reasons
l don't know about.

1047
01:27:32,994 --> 01:27:35,519
- He jumped me, Cody.
- Get back on the job.

1048
01:27:37,999 --> 01:27:41,127
That was pretty fancy wrestling, kid.
Where'd you learn it?

1049
01:27:41,202 --> 01:27:42,692
- In the army.
- You're a liar.

1050
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:44,705
They don't take cons in the army.

1051
01:27:44,773 --> 01:27:47,799
When the war broke out,
l didn't have any record except kid stuff.

1052
01:27:47,876 --> 01:27:50,845
What were you doing just now, soldier?
Going over the hill?

1053
01:27:50,912 --> 01:27:54,143
No. I figured maybe Id run in to L.A.

1054
01:27:54,282 --> 01:27:56,273
Be back before anyone knew.

1055
01:27:57,619 --> 01:28:01,385
- What's doing in L.A.?
- My wife. She don't know where I am.

1056
01:28:01,456 --> 01:28:04,687
When we crashed out,
l didn't leave no forwarding address.

1057
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:08,627
- It's the truth, Cody.
- Why didn't you ask me?

1058
01:28:08,696 --> 01:28:10,630
l figured you might get sore.

1059
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:12,757
So you took off on your own.

1060
01:28:12,834 --> 01:28:14,961
l haven't seen her in a long time.

1061
01:28:15,036 --> 01:28:17,869
Im human, you know, like everyone else.

1062
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:23,107
All right, kid.

1063
01:28:30,218 --> 01:28:31,845
You're just lonesome.

1064
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,081
Lonesome like me.

1065
01:28:34,589 --> 01:28:35,749
You?

1066
01:28:36,691 --> 01:28:39,285
- What about...
- You mean Verna?

1067
01:28:40,795 --> 01:28:43,958
All I ever had was Ma. Now...

1068
01:28:45,066 --> 01:28:46,465
Your mother alive?

1069
01:28:46,734 --> 01:28:49,828
No, she died before I even knew her.

1070
01:28:52,373 --> 01:28:55,865
l was just walking around out there
talking to mine.

1071
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,876
- That sounds funny to you?
- No.

1072
01:29:03,384 --> 01:29:04,874
Some might think so.

1073
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:07,451
My old lady never had anything.

1074
01:29:07,622 --> 01:29:10,989
Always on the run, always on the move.
Some life.

1075
01:29:11,559 --> 01:29:14,926
First, it was my old man, died kicking
and screaming in a nut house...

1076
01:29:14,996 --> 01:29:18,989
then my brother,
and after that, it was taking care of me.

1077
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,292
Always trying to put me on top.

1078
01:29:22,937 --> 01:29:24,905
"Top of the world," she used to say.

1079
01:29:24,973 --> 01:29:27,669
And then,
times when Id be losing my grip...

1080
01:29:27,775 --> 01:29:29,800
there she'd be, right behind me...

1081
01:29:29,878 --> 01:29:33,314
pushing me back up again. And now...

1082
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:37,978
Anyway, she quit running, Cody.

1083
01:29:38,052 --> 01:29:39,610
Yeah. Quit running.

1084
01:29:41,322 --> 01:29:45,691
That was a good feeling out there,
talking to her.

1085
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,450
Just me and Ma.

1086
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:51,164
A good feeling. I liked it.

1087
01:29:54,969 --> 01:29:56,459
Maybe I am nuts.

1088
01:29:57,839 --> 01:29:59,739
Let's go in and have a drink.

1089
01:30:03,144 --> 01:30:06,580
Tell you what, Vic. I've got an idea.

1090
01:30:07,949 --> 01:30:11,407
We'll pick up your wife
after the job tomorrow.

1091
01:30:11,486 --> 01:30:14,853
We'll all take a little trip.
Just the four of us.

1092
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:17,048
No kidding, Cody. That sounds great.

1093
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:20,720
You mean that, honey?
We could have fun. Live big.

1094
01:30:20,962 --> 01:30:23,157
Money's just paper if you don't spend it.

1095
01:30:23,231 --> 01:30:25,563
- That's an idea.
- It's a good idea.

1096
01:30:25,633 --> 01:30:28,101
Europe, maybe. Paris.

1097
01:30:28,703 --> 01:30:31,103
Rubbing shoulders with the best of them.

1098
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:33,635
How do you do, Countess?

1099
01:30:34,175 --> 01:30:38,236
Sable coats,
jewels just dripping from my fingers.

1100
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:41,680
Id knock their eyes out, Cody.
You'd be real proud of me.

1101
01:30:44,018 --> 01:30:45,849
Don't go flipping your lid.

1102
01:30:48,289 --> 01:30:52,089
He ain't thought of a vacation
in years, Vic. Don't let him forget it.

1103
01:30:52,427 --> 01:30:54,827
Here's to us, top of the world.

1104
01:30:59,901 --> 01:31:01,835
How's the radio coming, Verna?

1105
01:31:01,903 --> 01:31:04,531
- A crystal set would play better.
- Yeah?

1106
01:31:04,939 --> 01:31:06,770
Maybe I could fix it for you.

1107
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:09,275
l wish you would, Vic.
Im dead without music.

1108
01:31:09,344 --> 01:31:10,504
We'll get a new one.

1109
01:31:10,578 --> 01:31:15,208
l don't mind fixing it, Cody.
Keep me busy. I can't sleep anyhow.

1110
01:31:15,383 --> 01:31:16,975
Anything you say, kid.

1111
01:31:17,118 --> 01:31:21,054
- I was just gonna throw it away.
- Im not making any promises.

1112
01:31:21,255 --> 01:31:25,624
We better hit the hay, Duchess.
We got a heavy day tomorrow.

1113
01:31:31,099 --> 01:31:33,727
- See you in the morning.
- Right.

1114
01:31:37,638 --> 01:31:39,629
Grab the brass ring.

1115
01:32:19,414 --> 01:32:21,382
What are you doing? We're on our way.

1116
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:24,350
You've got to have a chain on the ground,
get rid of electricity.

1117
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:27,445
That's only when you got
gasoline or chemicals inside.

1118
01:32:27,922 --> 01:32:31,380
You want to have some traffic cop
think you got a load of something else?

1119
01:32:31,626 --> 01:32:34,117
That's using your head, kid.
All right, snap it up.

1120
01:32:41,669 --> 01:32:43,762
You all know what you're to do...

1121
01:32:43,871 --> 01:32:46,101
and you know where the rendezvous is.

1122
01:32:46,207 --> 01:32:48,607
We're to pick up our driver there at 5:00...

1123
01:32:48,676 --> 01:32:51,839
and we'll be at the plant
right after the day shift has checked off.

1124
01:32:51,913 --> 01:32:54,541
Now, Vic and Tommy, we go in the truck.

1125
01:32:54,615 --> 01:32:56,845
The rest of you go
with Verna in the sedan.

1126
01:32:57,051 --> 01:33:00,145
Baby, don't get picked up for speeding.

1127
01:33:00,655 --> 01:33:02,122
But get them there.

1128
01:33:03,391 --> 01:33:05,791
Don't worry, honey. I'll get them there.

1129
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:39,826
$12,000 and she's getting ready
to blow up in your face.

1130
01:33:39,894 --> 01:33:42,488
Might be a cracked radiator.
We'd better stop somewhere.

1131
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:45,054
There's a gas station down the hill, Cody.

1132
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,558
Pull in and watch yourself.

1133
01:33:56,911 --> 01:33:57,935
Fill her up?

1134
01:33:58,012 --> 01:34:00,947
- With water, bub. Check that radiator.
- Okay.

1135
01:34:03,885 --> 01:34:07,082
- You got a washroom, mister?
- Yeah. Cleanest in the West.

1136
01:34:10,825 --> 01:34:12,292
Dry as a bone.

1137
01:34:35,082 --> 01:34:36,811
Go get Vic. Hurry up.

1138
01:34:49,263 --> 01:34:51,424
- Cody says to hurry up.
- All right.

1139
01:35:02,977 --> 01:35:05,241
l thought you said cleanest in the West.

1140
01:35:05,313 --> 01:35:06,837
You ever see a cleaner one, mister?

1141
01:35:06,914 --> 01:35:09,712
- The mirror's so dirty you can see double.
- What?

1142
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:21,762
Wise guys. Didn't even buy gas.

1143
01:35:43,451 --> 01:35:45,282
Into the wooden horse, boys.

1144
01:35:47,588 --> 01:35:49,215
Where do we go, Trader?

1145
01:35:51,392 --> 01:35:53,223
You should be back in about three hours.

1146
01:35:53,294 --> 01:35:55,319
- I'll wait.
- We'll be here. Where's the driver?

1147
01:35:55,396 --> 01:35:57,887
He's having a cup of coffee.
He'll be right out.

1148
01:35:58,733 --> 01:36:02,863
Bo. I heard you wanted to straighten out.
Driving a truck for a living.

1149
01:36:03,037 --> 01:36:07,064
- Tonight, I hand in my resignation.
- You better get going, Cody. Good luck.

1150
01:36:13,614 --> 01:36:14,638
Got it?

1151
01:36:14,715 --> 01:36:17,149
When you get to the plant,
park across the street.

1152
01:36:17,218 --> 01:36:20,210
lf there's any trouble,
give us the horn hard.

1153
01:36:28,195 --> 01:36:29,389
How is it in there?

1154
01:36:29,463 --> 01:36:31,522
Can't breathe good. Otherwise, fine.

1155
01:36:31,599 --> 01:36:32,691
Stop breathing.

1156
01:36:32,767 --> 01:36:34,667
There's a button up in the cab.

1157
01:36:34,735 --> 01:36:37,533
Press it once if trouble shows,
and three times for all clear.

1158
01:36:37,605 --> 01:36:38,594
Okay.

1159
01:37:04,265 --> 01:37:06,130
Somebody's ribbing you, Russ.

1160
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,725
Take a slant
at the mirror in your washroom.

1161
01:37:13,874 --> 01:37:16,308
"Radio Signal Fallon."
You know what that means, sir?

1162
01:37:16,377 --> 01:37:18,709
You bet I know what it means. It's Hank.

1163
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:21,407
Call the FCC.
Get every direction-finder car they've got.

1164
01:37:21,482 --> 01:37:23,882
Ask them to clear the air. Now listen...

1165
01:37:54,215 --> 01:37:55,204
Got him.

1166
01:37:57,017 --> 01:37:59,042
This is Car A at La Canada Verdugo.

1167
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,953
Receiving signal, 105 degrees. Will repeat.

1168
01:38:02,056 --> 01:38:03,614
<i>105 degrees.</i>

1169
01:38:04,191 --> 01:38:05,180

1181
01:39:26,874 --> 01:39:29,069
That looks like the Long Beach area.

01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:15,378

They must have stopped.

1191
01:41:48,649 --> 01:41:51,243
- Check. 198th and Figueroa.
- That's it.

1192
01:41:52,052 --> 01:41:55,078
Send out a call.
All cars proceed to 198th and Figueroa.

1193
01:42:17,311 --> 01:42:18,539
Drop the gun.

1194
01:42:21,315 --> 01:42:22,680
Now turn around.

1195
01:43:37,057 --> 01:43:39,321
- Cody, that guy's a copper.
- What?

1196
01:43:39,393 --> 01:43:42,089
He's a T-man. I know him.
His name is Fallon.

1197
01:43:44,264 --> 01:43:46,164
He pinched me four years ago.

1198
01:43:48,635 --> 01:43:50,262
Don't go for your guns.

1199
01:43:53,607 --> 01:43:54,631
A copper.

1200
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:59,907
A copper. How do you like that, boys?

1201
01:44:00,814 --> 01:44:03,749
A copper and his name is Fallon.

1202
01:44:06,086 --> 01:44:08,816
And we went for it. I went for it.

1203
01:44:09,356 --> 01:44:11,347
Treated him like a kid brother.

1204
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:15,224
And I was going to split 50-50
with a copper.

1205
01:44:18,165 --> 01:44:20,395
Maybe they're waiting
to pin a medal on him.

1206
01:44:20,467 --> 01:44:23,732
Solid gold.
Come on. Get up. Get your hands up.

1207
01:44:24,338 --> 01:44:28,206
Yeah, that's it.
A nice gold medal for the copper.

1208
01:44:28,575 --> 01:44:31,772
Only maybe he's gonna get it
sooner than he thinks.

1209
01:44:36,416 --> 01:44:38,680
Cody, the joint's crawling with cops.

1210
01:44:48,428 --> 01:44:51,488
- Let him have it.
- Oh, no. And lose our ace in the hole?

1211
01:44:51,565 --> 01:44:54,398
He's going to walk us out of here.
Ain't you, copper? Get up.

1212
01:44:54,468 --> 01:44:56,436
It won't work. They'll shoot just the same.

1213
01:44:56,503 --> 01:44:59,404
- They won't shoot one of their own.
- They won't make any deals.

1214
01:44:59,473 --> 01:45:01,202
You better pray that they do.

1215
01:45:01,275 --> 01:45:04,574
<i>Jarrett, you and your men
might as well give up.</i>

1216
01:45:05,212 --> 01:45:07,806
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

1217
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:17,857
We've got your boy Fallon in here,
and he'll be all right if you do as I say.

1218
01:45:20,928 --> 01:45:23,260
She says she can get Jarrett to come out.

1219
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:25,457
lf I can, mister, will you go easy on me?

1220
01:45:25,532 --> 01:45:29,093
I'll tell him you'll let him get away
because you don't want your guy hurt.

1221
01:45:29,169 --> 01:45:33,105
He'll believe me. Then, when he comes
out, you can do what you want with him.

1222
01:45:33,273 --> 01:45:34,797
No deal. Lock her up.

1223
01:45:34,975 --> 01:45:36,203
Cheap copper!

1224
01:45:36,977 --> 01:45:39,275
<i>Jarrett, you haven't got a chance.</i>

1225
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,375
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

1226
01:45:41,448 --> 01:45:43,939
"Come out with your hands up,"
the man says.

1227
01:45:44,151 --> 01:45:46,176
How do you like that, Ma?

1228
01:45:46,253 --> 01:45:48,448
Here's my answer, you dirty...

1229
01:45:54,027 --> 01:45:56,257
Fan out! Give them
tear gas from both sides.

1230
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:58,560
That was Cody Jarrett talking!

1231
01:46:14,982 --> 01:46:17,951
Out this way, Cody. Through that door.

1232
01:46:18,886 --> 01:46:20,786
Here's yours, copper.

1233
01:46:41,508 --> 01:46:43,305
Wait a minute. It's Fallon.

1234
01:46:55,722 --> 01:46:57,622
- You all right, Hank?
- Yeah, sure. Quick...

1235
01:46:57,691 --> 01:47:00,717
get a car out to Charlie's Roadhouse,
Highway 60, near Colton.

1236
01:47:00,794 --> 01:47:03,456
Pick up Daniel Winston.
He's the fence you're looking for.

1237
01:47:05,933 --> 01:47:07,958
- What's out here, Bo?
- An alley.

1238
01:47:09,303 --> 01:47:10,930
Happy, try it.

1239
01:47:11,004 --> 01:47:13,871
Come on. Get going.

1240
01:48:22,175 --> 01:48:24,234
We've got Bo Creel. They're heading up.

1241
01:49:08,688 --> 01:49:11,418
Got them on the ground
heading for the Horton Sphere area.

1242
01:49:11,491 --> 01:49:13,391
Send men out to that section.

1243
01:49:35,982 --> 01:49:39,145
Pass the word along. Don't fire
unless you've got a perfect target.

1244
01:49:39,219 --> 01:49:41,016
That place is a stack of dynamite.

1245
01:49:48,128 --> 01:49:51,222
Have that area surrounded.
Get some searchlights.

1246
01:50:22,496 --> 01:50:24,691
They think they've got Cody Jarrett.

1247
01:50:25,465 --> 01:50:28,957
They haven't got Cody Jarrett, you hear?
They haven't got him.

1248
01:50:29,369 --> 01:50:32,065
And Im gonna show you
they haven't got him.

1249
01:50:32,172 --> 01:50:34,265
Come on. Come with me.

1250
01:50:58,031 --> 01:51:02,024
Don't shoot.
It's me, Ryley. Im coming out.

1251
01:51:30,597 --> 01:51:32,428
<i>You might as well come down, Jarrett.</i>

1252
01:51:32,499 --> 01:51:35,024
<i>There's no one left but you.</i>

1253
01:51:35,101 --> 01:51:36,932
Come and get me.

1254
01:51:43,343 --> 01:51:44,935
Get the gun, Hank.

1255
01:52:11,738 --> 01:52:13,433
What's holding him up?

1256
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:45,401
Made it, Ma!

1257
01:52:45,772 --> 01:52:47,637
Top of the world!

1258
01:53:01,988 --> 01:53:03,216
Cody Jarrett.

1259
01:53:05,492 --> 01:53:09,588
He finally got to the top of the world.
And it blew right up in his face.
