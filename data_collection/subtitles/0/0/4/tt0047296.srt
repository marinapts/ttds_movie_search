1
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:54,046
Now you take it easy, slugger.

2
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,198
Joey!

3
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,162
Joe Doyle!

4
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,086
All right! What do you want?

5
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,642
I got one of your birds.

6
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,197
I recognised him by the band.

7
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:29,281
lt must be Danny-boy.
I lost him in the last race.

8
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,527
He flew into my coop.

9
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,646
-You want him?
-I got to watch myself these days.

10
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:36,477
You know what I mean?

11
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:37,638
Don't worry.

12
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:41,563
-I'll take him up to your loft.
-Okay, I'll see you on the roof.

13
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:06,758
How goes?

14
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,043
He's up on the roof.

15
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:10,244
The pigeon?

16
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,403
Yeah, it worked.

17
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:19,439
I think somebody fell off the roof.

18
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:28,999
He thought he'd sing
to the Crime Commission. He won't.

19
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,807
I thought they'd talk to him.

20
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,083
That's the idea.

21
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:34,808
I thought they'd talk to him
and get him to dummy up.

22
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,527
Maybe he gave them an argument.

23
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,045
I figured the worst they was gonna do
was lean on him a little bit.

24
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:41,801
Maybe he gave them an argument.

25
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,245
He's been giving Johnny the Boss
a lot of arguments lately.

26
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:48,367
He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.

27
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:49,564
A canary.

28
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,083
Maybe he could sing, but he couldn't fly.

29
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:00,319
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

30
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:05,205
I'll be in there later and....

31
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:16,482
Father Barry is here.

32
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,564
Same thing happened to my Andy
five years ago.

33
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,799
-You're the boy's father?
-That's right.

34
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,528
Looks like he fell off the roof,
or maybe he was pushed.

35
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:28,724
-Any ideas?
-No.

36
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:32,597
He was the only longshoreman that had
the guts to talk to the crime investigators.

37
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,441
-Who asked you?
-Everybody knows that.

38
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:35,245
Shut up.

39
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:38,287
-lf he took my advice he wouldn't be--
-Everyone knows that.

40
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:39,358
I said, ''Shut up!''

41
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,122
I know how you feel about cops,
but if you give me...

42
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:43,562
...some leads I could--

43
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:45,685
I kept telling him, ''Don't say nothing.

44
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,680
''Keep quiet, you'll live longer.''

45
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:52,723
I've been on the docks all my life,
boy, and there's one thing I learned.

46
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,926
You don't ask no questions,
you don't answer no questions...

47
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,398
...unless you want to wind up like that.

48
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:03,679
Edie, come here.

49
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:06,207
I want to talk to you.

50
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,919
Father, who'd want to kill Joey?

51
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,678
Stay away from him! Stay away from him!

52
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,522
Edie, listen!

53
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,645
Remember time and faith are great healers.

54
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:22,641
Father, my brother is dead
and you talk about time and faith.

55
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:26,119
My brother was the best kid in the
neighbourhood and everybody said so.

56
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,439
I'm in the church if you need me.

57
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,481
You're in the church if I need you?

58
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:34,288
Did you ever hear of a saint
hiding in a church?

59
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,044
I want to know who killed my brother!

60
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,159
What's the matter with you, punk?

61
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:50,443
Boss, Packy wants another drink
on the cuff.

62
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,442
Give it to him.

63
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,046
And here's the cut on the shape-up.

64
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:59,441
891 men, $3 a head. That's $2,673.

65
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,167
Charley, you count them.

66
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,326
The banana boat is 46 tomorrow.

67
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:08,685
lf we pull a walkout,
it might be a few bucks from the shippers.

68
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,408
-Them bananas go bad in a hurry.
-Ask $2,000.

69
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,967
Clowns can't fight.

70
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,080
There's nobody tough anymore.

71
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:20,922
Hi, slugger.

72
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,118
Hi, kid.

73
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,883
Where's Morgan?
Where's that big banker of mine?

74
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:32,448
Right here, Mr. Friendly.

75
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,726
-Hi, JP, how's business?
-Having trouble with Kelly again, boss.

76
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:38,607
He won't take no loans
and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.

77
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,157
-He's my wife's nephew.
-He won't take no loans!

78
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,558
I got to put him to work.
She'd murder me!

79
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:45,605
That's why I never got married.

80
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,681
Here's the interest on the day, boss. $532.

81
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,518
You count it.

82
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:52,281
Counting makes me sleepy.

83
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,726
You handle that sheet metal all right?

84
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,562
lt was easy. The new checker faked
the receipt. Here.

85
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:00,368
You want to talk to me,
take the cigar out of your mouth.

86
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,679
-Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
-Sure.

87
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:06,125
-Here you are, 45 bills.
-Terry, you count this.

88
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,766
Come on, go on, it's good for you.

89
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,601
-lt develops your mind.
-What mind?

90
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,327
Shut up. I like the kid.

91
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:17,526
Remember the night
he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley?

92
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:20,806
We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.

93
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,527
I lost the count.

94
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:26,765
Okay, forget it, Einstein.

95
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:30,166
How come you never got an education
like your brother Charley?

96
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,924
The only arithmetic he ever got
was hearing the referee count up to 10.

97
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:36,523
You're not too funny today, Fat Man.

98
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:41,199
Hey, what gives
with our boy tonight, Charley?

99
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:42,763
He isn't himself.

100
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,159
lt's the Joey Doyle thing
and how he exaggerates the thing.

101
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,082
Too much Marquis of Queensbury
softens him up.

102
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,127
Listen, I'm a soft touch, too.
Ask any rummy on the dock...

103
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:55,645
...if I'm not good for a fin any time
they put the arm on me.

104
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,601
But my old lady raised us 10 kids
on a stinking watchman's pension.

105
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:05,037
When I was 16,
I had to beg for work in the hold.

106
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,638
I didn't work my way up
out of there for nothing.

107
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,481
I know that, Johnny, I know it.

108
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:12,764
Taking over this local took a little doing.

109
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:16,558
There were rough fellas in the way.
They gave me this to remember them by.

110
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,608
He kept his hand over his throat
to stay alive and he still went after them.

111
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,361
I know what's eating you.

112
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:28,608
I got 2,000 dues-paying members in
this local, that's $72,000 a year legitimate.

113
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:33,201
When each one of them puts in
a couple of bucks a day just to make sure...

114
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,883
...the work's steady, well, figure it out.

115
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,847
That's just for openers.

116
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,966
We've got the fattest piers
in the fattest harbour in the world.

117
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,199
Everything moves in and out,
we take our cut.

118
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,123
Why shouldn't we?
lf we can get it, we're entitled to it.

119
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:51,044
You don't suppose I can afford to be
boxed out of a deal like this, do you?

120
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,168
A deal I sweated and bled for, on account
of one lousy little cheese-eater...

121
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:59,401
...that Doyle bum, who thinks he can
squeal to the crime commission. Do you?

122
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,238
Do you?

123
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,888
No, Johnny.
I just figured I should have been told.

124
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,607
I make it $2,623.

125
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,087
You're $50 short, Skins.

126
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:23,038
Gimme.

127
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:27,446
-I must've miscounted.
-Gimme!

128
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:38,921
You come from Green Point, go back there.
You don't work here no more.

129
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:47,963
Here, kid, here's half a bill.
Go get you a load on.

130
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:49,641
No, I'm okay, Johnny, thanks.

131
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,685
Present from your Uncle Johnny.

132
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:56,885
And Mac, tomorrow morning when you
shape the men, put Terry up in the loft.

133
00:09:56,969 --> 00:09:59,324
Number one. Every day.

134
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:03,479
lt's nice, easy work if you check in
and goof off on a coffee bag.

135
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,843
Okay?

136
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:13,481
You got a real friend here.

137
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:15,328
Now don't forget it.

138
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,927
Why should he forget it?

139
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,562
Thanks, Johnny.

140
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,527
All right, payday.

141
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:31,358
Rony.

142
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:33,518
Mac.

143
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,288
Hi, Terry.

144
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:02,438
-Hi, kid.
-I was just going to feed them.

145
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,928
I already fed them.

146
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,727
You must've been up early?

147
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,723
I was up anyhow,
so I figured I might as well.

148
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,082
They sure got it made.

149
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:18,004
Eating, sleeping, flying around like crazy,
raising gobs of squabs.

150
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,560
Well, I better get over there.

151
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:35,600
Be careful. Don't spill no water on the
floor. I don't want them to catch cold.

152
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,808
I'll see you around.

153
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:48,440
Come on, Tony, give me the tabs.

154
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,121
He was a good boy, that Doyle kid.

155
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,404
Sure he was,
that's why he got it in the head.

156
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:59,049
But he couldn't learn
to keep his mouth shut.

157
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:06,279
Hey, Pop, why don't you go home?

158
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,883
The boys at work today
will be chipping in gladly.

159
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,766
No thanks, fellas, I'm gonna shape.

160
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:15,479
-Who do you think'll pay for the funeral?
-Johnny Friendly, the ''great labour leader.''

161
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:18,722
Why don't you keep that big mouth
of yours shut?

162
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,481
What are you, a wise guy?

163
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,641
lf I was wise, I wouldn't be
no longshoreman for 30 years.

164
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,845
I'm poorer now than when I started.

165
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,442
-Wise guy.
-Big mouth.

166
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,999
Don't mess with those guys.

167
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:34,925
I brought you Joey's windbreaker.
lt might come in handy.

168
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:37,682
-Go ahead, wear it.
-Thanks, Pop.

169
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,681
Mine's more full of holes
than the Pittsburgh infield.

170
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,602
Hey, Joe, I got a coat for you.

171
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:57,001
Do you know Terry Malloy?

172
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:59,519
No, I don't. Never heard of him.

173
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,640
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?

174
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:07,724
So what?

175
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:10,369
Didn't I see you fight
a couple of years ago?

176
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:13,480
Without the birdseed, what do you want?

177
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:15,241
ldentification.

178
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,599
Waterfront Crime Commission.
What's that?

179
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,645
I just want to ask you a few questions.

180
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:26,289
We'll hold public hearings
on waterfront crime...

181
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,929
...and underworld infiltration
of longshore unions.

182
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,126
-I don't know nothing.
-You haven't heard the questions yet.

183
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,245
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

184
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:38,288
There's a rumour that you're one of
the last people to see Joey Doyle alive.

185
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:39,597
I don't know nothing.

186
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:41,919
Nobody's accusing you of anything,
Mr. Malloy.

187
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:43,442
I hope you understand that.

188
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:47,158
Just want to ask you some questions
about some people you may know.

189
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,325
-People I may know.
-That's right.

190
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:55,206
-You better get out of here, buster!
-Slow down, boy.

191
00:13:56,729 --> 00:14:00,085
I don't know nothing, I ain't seen nothing,
and I'm not saying nothing.

192
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,364
Why don't you and your girlfriend take off.

193
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:03,802
All right, Mr. Malloy!

194
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:06,847
You've every right not to talk
if that's what you choose to do.

195
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,318
-The public has a right to know the facts.
-Yeah.

196
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:10,842
We'll be seeing you again.

197
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:13,682
Never's going to be too much soon
for me, Shorty.

198
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,363
Take it easy.

199
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:20,168
How do you like them mutts
taking me for a pigeon.

200
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:22,684
-Who is it?
-I don't know who they are.

201
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:26,758
You're three weeks behind on the last $25,
but I'm willing to take a chance.

202
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:30,205
Some chance at ten percent a week
and if we don't borrow, we don't work.

203
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,927
May you rot in hell, JP.

204
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:35,202
When I'm dead and gone,
you'll know what a friend I was.

205
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,167
Why don't you drop dead now,
so we can test your theory?

206
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:39,682
Condolences.

207
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,088
Hey, Pop, look.

208
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,328
Let her go, Tony.

209
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,478
I guess I spoke out of turn last night.

210
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:14,442
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider
with a turned-around collar, don't you?

211
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:22,638
I see the sisters taught you not to lie.

212
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,806
All right. Loft gang: Malloy...

213
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,002
...Hendriks, Padowski...

214
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,600
...Westerfield, McGuier.

215
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,446
I've been thinking about your question,
and you're right, Edie.

216
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,008
This is my parish.

217
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:47,522
I don't know how much I can do,
but I'll never find out...

218
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:50,840
...unless I come down here
and take a good look for myself.

219
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:53,398
I need some extra banana carriers.

220
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:54,524
Bananas again.

221
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:58,397
I wonder when we'll get a boat from
lreland with good lrish whiskey on it.

222
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,684
Dugan, my boy, you're dreaming again.

223
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:05,044
All right. Kelly. Richie.

224
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,198
Yeah, you.

225
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:21,122
What's the matter?
Nobody want to work today?

226
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:24,888
Yeah, you.

227
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,649
Who do you see to get
a day's pay around here?

228
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,319
-Meatballs.
-Definitely.

229
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,517
Come here.

230
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:01,123
Hey, Terry, grab that one!

231
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,447
Give me that.

232
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:08,518
Get away!

233
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:11,528
-Give it to me!
-Why?

234
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,367
Give it to me!

235
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,761
What makes you so special?

236
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:18,607
Things are looking up on the dock.

237
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:21,203
Don't you recognise her?
That's Joey Doyle's sister.

238
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:22,608
Give me that.

239
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,127
-You're Joey Doyle's sister?
-Yes, I am.

240
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,117
You don't wanna go to work today anyhow.

241
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,039
lt's been nice wrestling with you.

242
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,198
Edie!

243
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,523
Pop. Here's your tab, take it.

244
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,839
All right, give it to me. I can use it.

245
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:51,238
Now get back to the sisters
where you belong.

246
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:54,685
I'm surprised at you, Father,
if you don't mind my saying so.

247
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:58,205
Letting her see things ain't fit
for the eyes of a decent girl.

248
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:00,969
All right, that's all. Come back tomorrow.

249
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,001
What do you do now?

250
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:10,565
Like Big Mac said, come back tomorrow.

251
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,526
Tomorrow? No ship tomorrow.

252
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,999
I've been standing here for five
straight mornings and that bum there...

253
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:19,604
-Come on, get out of here!
-...looks right through you.

254
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:24,367
-I'm sorry, Father, I didn't mean it.
-What do you want to do?

255
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,486
Come on, let's go get a ball.

256
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:29,766
Wait a minute.
ls this all you do, just take it like this?

257
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:32,887
What about your unions?

258
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:39,607
No other union in the country'd
stand for a thing like that.

259
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:42,965
The waterfront is tougher, Father,
like it ain't part of America.

260
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,678
-Do you know how a trigger local works?
-No. How?

261
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:51,240
You get up in the meeting, you make a
motion, the lights go out, then you go out.

262
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:54,719
That's how it's been since Johnny
and his cowboys took over the local.

263
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,846
Name one place where it's safe
to talk without getting clobbered.

264
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,965
-The church.
-What?

265
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,087
The bottom of the church.

266
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,729
You know
what you're letting yourself in for?

267
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,361
You got a cigarette on you?

268
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:23,047
Right over there.

269
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:32,723
-You working hard?
-Yeah.

270
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:37,246
You wouldn't mind working once in a while
to justify this lofty position, would you?

271
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:41,243
I finished the work.
I counted all them bags.

272
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,126
We have an extra detail for you.

273
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:46,406
That's if you don't mind
being disturbed or anything.

274
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:52,641
The priest and this Doyle girl are getting
a meeting up together down at the church.

275
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:55,926
We want a rundown on the names
and the numbers of all the players.

276
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,967
Wait a minute. All right, you're nominated.

277
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:01,887
Why me, Charley?
I feel funny going down there.

278
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,286
I'd just be stooling for you.

279
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,918
Let me tell you what stooling is.
Stooling is when you rat on your friend...

280
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:10,159
...the guys you're with.
Johnny wants a favour.

281
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:12,319
Don't think about it. Do it.

282
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,400
Go on. Join the congregation.

283
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:34,689
I thought there would be
more of you here, but....

284
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:40,283
The Romans found out what a handful
could do if it's the right handful.

285
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,846
I'm just a potato-eater,
but isn't it simple as one, two, three?

286
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:50,806
One. The working conditions are bad.

287
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:53,323
Two. They're bad
because the mob does the hiring.

288
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:57,766
Three. The only way to break the mob is
to stop letting them get away with murder.

289
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:01,239
lf one of you'll answer one question,
we'd have a very good start.

290
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:04,401
And that question is:
Who killed Joey Doyle?

291
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,807
Not one of you has a line
on who killed Joey Doyle?

292
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,640
I have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it.

293
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,407
All right, then answer this one:

294
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:30,846
How can we call ourselves Christians and
protect these murderers with our silence?

295
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:39,363
Jimmy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.

296
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:42,124
How can you just sit there
and not say anything?

297
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:45,724
I'll always think of him as my best friend,
but what do you want me to--

298
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,367
Who asked him in here?

299
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:50,803
I'm trying to find out
what happened to Joey Doyle.

300
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,005
-Maybe you can be helpful.
-Helpful?

301
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,121
The brother of Charley the Gent?

302
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:57,484
They'll help us get to the bottom
of the river.

303
00:21:57,569 --> 00:21:59,446
You better leave Charley out of this.

304
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:02,760
-You don't think he'd be helpful?
-Why don't you ask him yourself?

305
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:07,240
-Maybe I will one of these days.
-One of these days.

306
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:10,883
Now, listen, you know who the pistols are.

307
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:15,605
Are you going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one?

308
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:18,364
Are you?

309
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:21,680
Dugan! How about you? Are you?

310
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:24,363
One thing you have to understand,
Father, on the dock...

311
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:26,201
...we've always been D and D.

312
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,245
-D and D? What's that?
-Deaf and dumb.

313
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:31,048
No matter how much
we hate the torpedoes, we don't rat.

314
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:33,484
Rat? Now boys, get smart.

315
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:37,481
I know you're getting pushed around,
but there's one thing...

316
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:40,367
...we have in this country,
and that's ways of fighting back.

317
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:42,087
Getting the facts to the public.

318
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:45,047
Testifying for what is right against
what is wrong.

319
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:49,008
What's ratting to them is telling the truth
for you, can't you see that?

320
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:52,565
Can't you see that?

321
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:12,200
lt seems to me we've gone just about
as far as we can at this time.

322
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:14,678
I think you'll agree with that, Father.

323
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:18,080
So, I'd like to close with a few words
from St. Matthew:

324
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:21,128
''Come unto me all you--''

325
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:30,004
What did I tell you
about sticking your neck out.

326
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:33,201
-This is a police problem, not ours.
-These people need help.

327
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:36,281
Okay. Only don't blame me when
they ship you off to Abyssinia.

328
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:37,358
I won't.

329
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:47,481
You better go home in pairs.
Twos is two, you know.

330
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:49,878
Come on.

331
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,758
Pop!

332
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:08,443
Edie!

333
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:26,848
What's happened to Pop?

334
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,887
He's all right.
He's an old man, they won't hurt him.

335
00:24:30,249 --> 00:24:31,443
Get out, you!

336
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:39,442
Are you all right?

337
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:42,248
Yeah, considering they were using
my head for a baseball.

338
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:44,684
You still D and D?
Do you still call it ratting?

339
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,805
-Are you on the level?
-What do you think?

340
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,801
lf I stick my neck out and it's chopped off,
is that the end?

341
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,403
-Or will you go all the way?
-Down the line.

342
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:55,720
They'll put muscle on you, too,
turned-around collar or not.

343
00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:00,041
Wipe your face. Listen, you stand up
and I'll stand up with you.

344
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,006
-Right down the wire?
-So help me God.

345
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:07,682
I think we're okay.

346
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:09,839
Steel pipes and baseball bats.

347
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:12,085
They play pretty rough around here.

348
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:14,239
I can make it home now all right.

349
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:17,807
Which side are you with?

350
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:20,760
Me? I'm with me, Terry.

351
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:23,764
You got a dime for a cup of coffee?

352
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:25,567
Go on, beat it, will you?

353
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:27,646
A little dime you don't need?

354
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:32,165
I know you. You're Edie Doyle.

355
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:34,478
Come on. Beat it.

356
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:38,801
Your brother was a saint, the only one
who ever tried to get me compensation.

357
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:40,803
You remember, Terry.

358
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:42,561
You was there that night.

359
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,723
Here's some change.
Go have yourself a ball.

360
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:52,725
You don't buy me. You're still a bum.

361
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:54,643
So long, Edie.

362
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:57,247
Lord have mercy on Joey.

363
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:00,647
Who's calling me a bum?

364
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:04,962
Everybody loved Joey.

365
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:08,359
From little kids to the old rummies.

366
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,281
Did you know him very well?

367
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:15,407
You know, he got around.

368
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:19,041
What did that man mean just now?

369
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:22,758
Don't pay no attention to him.
He's drunk, he's falling down. Everything.

370
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,443
He's a juicehead
that hangs around the neighbourhood.

371
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:27,167
Don't pay no attention.

372
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:28,808
I better go now.

373
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:32,965
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not going to bite you.

374
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:36,885
I guess they don't let you walk
with fellas where you've been?

375
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,766
You know how the sisters are.

376
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:39,804
Yeah.

377
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,848
-Are you training to be a nun?
-lt's just a regular college.

378
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:47,759
lt's run by the Sisters of St. Anne.

379
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:49,723
Where is that?

380
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:51,923
ln Tarrytown.

381
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:55,364
-Where's that?
-ln the country.

382
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:58,926
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.

383
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:03,166
How often do you get in here?

384
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:08,003
I haven't been here since last Christmas.

385
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,797
We were going to have
a Thanksgiving party.

386
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:13,518
That's nice.

387
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:17,288
What do you do up there? Just study?

388
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:19,842
I want to be a teacher.

389
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,363
Teacher? That's very good.

390
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:24,647
Personally, I admire brains.

391
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:28,881
My brother Charley is a very brainy guy.
He had a couple of years of college.

392
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:33,408
lt isn't just brains. lt's how you use them.

393
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,719
Yeah, I get your thought.

394
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:38,318
You know, I've seen you
a lot of times before.

395
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,640
Do you remember parochial school
out on Puluski Street?

396
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:43,401
Seven, eight years ago?

397
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:45,878
-Your hair, you had your hair....
-Braids.

398
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,358
Looked like a hunk of rope.

399
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:52,158
You had wires on your teeth and glasses.
Everything.

400
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,727
You was really a mess.

401
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:57,999
I can get home all right now, thanks.

402
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:01,248
Don't get sore.
I was just kidding you a little bit.

403
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:04,844
I just mean to tell you that you're,
you grew up very nice.

404
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:07,318
Thanks.

405
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:10,405
You don't remember me, do you?

406
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,564
I remembered you
the first moment I saw you.

407
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,002
By the nose, huh?

408
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,402
Some people just got faces that
stick in your mind.

409
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,799
I remember you were in trouble
all the time.

410
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:30,163
Now you got me.

411
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:34,926
The way those sisters used to whack me,
I don't know what.

412
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:39,802
They thought they was going to beat
an education into me, but I foxed them.

413
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,163
Maybe they just didn't know how
to handle you.

414
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:46,481
How would you have done it?

415
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,763
With a little more patience and kindness.

416
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,404
That's what makes people
mean and difficult.

417
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:56,719
People don't care enough about them.

418
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:02,841
Are you kidding me?

419
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:04,841
I'd better get you home.

420
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:08,604
There's too many guys around here
with only one thing on their mind.

421
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,120
Am I going to see you again?

422
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:16,283
What for?

423
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:20,603
I don't know.

424
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:27,165
I really don't know.

425
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:33,923
Come on.

426
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:54,800
You're all packed. Here's your bus ticket
and you're on your way back to St. Anne's.

427
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:57,559
I'm not ready to go back yet, Pop.

428
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:01,281
Edie, for years your mom and me
put quarters in the cookie jar...

429
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,963
...to keep you up there with the sisters...

430
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:07,838
...and keep you from things like
I've just seen outside the window.

431
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:11,246
A daughter of mine walking arm in arm
with Terry Malloy.

432
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:13,889
-Do you know who Terry Malloy is?
-Who is he, Pop?

433
00:30:13,969 --> 00:30:16,483
He's the kid brother of Charley the Gent...

434
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,688
...who is Johnny Friendly's right hand
and a butcher in a camel hair coat.

435
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:24,479
Are you trying to tell me Terry is, too?

436
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:26,207
He tries to act tough...

437
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:30,719
...but there's a look in his eye.

438
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:35,008
Yeah, a look in his eye.
Hold your hats, brothers, here we go again.

439
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:39,522
You think he's one of them cases
you're always dragging into the house...

440
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,008
...and feeling sorry for...

441
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,603
...like that litter of kittens you brought in.

442
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:48,559
The only one you wanted to keep
had six toes and was cockeyed to boot.

443
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,246
Look at him. The little bum.

444
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:53,799
He said he wants to see me again.

445
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:02,087
See this arm?

446
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,399
Two inches longer than the other.

447
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:13,084
That's from years of working and sweating,
lifting and swinging a hook.

448
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:19,600
Every time I heist a box or a coffee bag,
I says to myself...

449
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,519
...that is for Edie so she can be
a teacher or something decent.

450
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,160
I promised your mom, Edie.
Don't let her down.

451
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:35,559
I don't want you to think
I'm not grateful for everything you've done.

452
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:39,039
For giving me the education
and keeping me away from all this.

453
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:42,563
But I've seen things
that I know are so wrong.

454
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:47,006
How can I go back to school and keep
my mind on things that are just in books...

455
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:48,966
...that aren't people living?

456
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:51,568
I'm going to stay.

457
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:55,483
I'm going to keep on trying
to find out who is guilty for Joey.

458
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:43,638
Hi.

459
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,518
What are you doing up there on the roof?

460
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:49,962
Just looking.

461
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,961
Take a look at the champion flock
of the neighbourhood.

462
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:57,162
Fly pretty nice, huh?

463
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:00,048
Golden Warriors?

464
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:04,679
Yeah. I founded the Golden Warriors.

465
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:07,837
Might say that I was
the original Golden Warrior.

466
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:12,046
This bum here is my shadow.

467
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:15,127
He thinks I'm a tough man
because I boxed pro a lot.

468
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:20,641
Joey used to raise pigeons.

469
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:25,361
Joey used to raise pigeons.

470
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,441
Yeah, he had a few birds.

471
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:34,280
I've been taking care of them.

472
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:38,006
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be so interested in pigeons.

473
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:41,648
I just go for it.

474
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:46,919
You know this city is full of hawks?

475
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:50,639
That's a fact.
They hang around on top of the big hotels.

476
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:55,919
They spot a pigeon in the park,
right down on them.

477
00:33:58,129 --> 00:33:59,448
You got a second?

478
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:05,246
I want to show you something.

479
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:16,203
What do you think of that fellow?

480
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,117
She's a beauty.

481
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:20,200
She's a he. His name is Swifty.

482
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,567
Look what he went and did.

483
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:32,527
He's my lead bird. He's always on
top of the perch. lf another bum tries...

484
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:36,079
...to come along and take his place,
he really lets him have it.

485
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,766
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

486
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,961
There's one thing about them,
they're very faithful.

487
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:47,321
They get married just like people.

488
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,319
Better.

489
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:51,717
They stay that way until one of them dies.

490
00:34:53,289 --> 00:34:54,517
That's nice.

491
00:35:00,689 --> 00:35:02,327
Go ahead. Fix the roof.

492
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:07,687
You want that egg?

493
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:12,522
Thanks.

494
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:18,242
Do you like beer?

495
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,768
I don't know.

496
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,839
I bet you never had a glass of beer.

497
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,849
-Did you ever have a glass of beer?
-No.

498
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,846
You want to have one with me?

499
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,037
ln a saloon?

500
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:43,006
I know a nice dump down here
that has a special entrance for ladies.

501
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:49,847
Come on, it won't hurt.

502
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,083
Come on.

503
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:58,563
Okay.

504
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,762
Hey, you, mac.

505
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,918
Two Glockenheimers and two for chasers.

506
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,558
-Did you see the fight last night?
-No.

507
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,081
A kid named Riley, both hands.
Like you used to do.

508
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:22,399
I hope he got better dice than me.

509
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:28,159
Were you really a prizefighter?

510
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:30,803
I used to be.

511
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,725
How did you get interested in that?

512
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:39,366
I don't know. I had to scrap all my life,
I might as well get paid for it.

513
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,083
When I was a kid
my old man got bumped off.

514
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:47,208
Never mind how.
Then they stuck Charley and me...

515
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,404
...in a dump they call a ''children's home.''

516
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:55,087
Boy, that was some home.

517
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:59,765
Anyhow, I ran away from there
and fought in the club smokers...

518
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:02,807
...and peddled papers and Johnny Friendly
bought a piece of me.

519
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,322
Bought a piece of you?

520
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:07,446
Yes. Then...

521
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:10,849
...I was going pretty good there for awhile.

522
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:12,522
And after that....

523
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:19,158
What do you really care, am I right?

524
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:24,563
Shouldn't everybody care about
everybody else?

525
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:29,520
Boy, what a fruitcake you are.

526
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:33,362
I mean, isn't everybody
a part of everybody else?

527
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,885
And you really believe that drool?

528
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:37,243
Yes, I do.

529
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:42,487
Here we are. One for the lady
and for the gent.

530
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,647
Here's to the first one,
I hope it ain't the last.

531
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:51,042
Go ahead.

532
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:58,720
No, not like that. One hum.

533
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:12,877
Do you want to hear my philosophy of life?

534
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:18,124
Do it to him before he does it to you.

535
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,800
I never met anyone like you.

536
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:27,239
There's not a spark of sentiment,
or romance...

537
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,365
...or human kindness in your whole body.

538
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:32,088
What good does it to you
besides get you in trouble?

539
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:35,878
And when things and people get in
your way, you just knock them aside...

540
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:37,960
...get rid of them. ls that your idea?

541
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:41,803
Don't look at me when you say that.
lt wasn't my fault what happened to Joey.

542
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,607
Fixing him wasn't my idea.

543
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:46,128
Who said it was?

544
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:48,719
Everybody's putting the needle on me.

545
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:52,128
You and the mugs in the church
and Father Barry.

546
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:54,359
I didn't like the way he was looking at me.

547
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:56,599
He was looking at everybody
the same way.

548
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:57,724
Oh, yeah?

549
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:00,560
What's with this Father Barry?

550
00:39:00,889 --> 00:39:02,925
-What's his racket?
-His racket?

551
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:04,488
Yeah, his racket.

552
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,844
-Everybody's got a racket.
-But he's a priest.

553
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,408
Are you kidding, so what?

554
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:12,164
-That don't make no difference.
-You don't believe anybody, do you?

555
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:15,165
Down here it's every man for himself.

556
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:18,559
lt's keeping alive. lt's standing
with the right people so you get...

557
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,038
...a little bit of change in your pocket.

558
00:39:21,129 --> 00:39:23,723
-And if you don't?
-lf you don't? Right down.

559
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,281
lt's living like an animal.

560
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:31,007
I'd rather live like an animal
than end up like....

561
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:32,124
Like Joey?

562
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:36,078
-Are you afraid to mention his name?
-No.

563
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:40,039
Why do you keep harping on that for?

564
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:44,600
Come on, drink up.
You got to get a little fun out of life.

565
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,965
Come on. I'll stick some music on.

566
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:55,402
What's the matter?

567
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:05,323
What's the matter with you?

568
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,605
Help me if you can for God's sake.

569
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:16,441
Edie, I'd like to help.

570
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:20,248
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

571
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,408
All right.

572
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:27,921
I shouldn't have asked you.

573
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,085
Edie, come on. Have a little beer.

574
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:34,128
Come on.

575
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:37,563
I don't want it.

576
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:43,959
You just stay here and finish your drink.

577
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:47,405
Don't go. I've got my whole life to drink.

578
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:54,247
Are you sore at me?

579
00:40:58,049 --> 00:40:59,323
What for?

580
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:07,403
I don't know, for not being no help to you.

581
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,124
You would if you could.

582
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:28,006
Here I come.

583
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:30,769
Pick a winner.

584
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:33,558
First I got to kiss the bride.

585
00:41:33,649 --> 00:41:37,119
Go on, you've kissed her before!

586
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,081
You can get out that way.
You want me to take you?

587
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:57,527
-Come on. What's going on here?
-Give me a cigarette.

588
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:59,725
You've got to stop smoking so much.

589
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:03,159
Come on, we'll get out through here.

590
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:06,008
What's the matter?

591
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,123
Come on.

592
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:14,767
That's a pretty tune.

593
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:21,927
Here's a stick of gum. lt'll do you good.

594
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:25,324
-Thank you.
-Do you like that music?

595
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:34,881
lf I had my tuxedo,
I'd ask you to dance, but....

596
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:38,160
Come on. You want to spin?

597
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:45,120
Come on, don't be afraid.

598
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:48,007
You dance divinely.

599
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:00,127
I think we're doing pretty good.

600
00:43:01,249 --> 00:43:03,399
The sisters ought to see you now.

601
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,562
Wait a minute.

602
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,564
I feel like I'm just floating.

603
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:16,402
I'm just floating.

604
00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:20,362
Just floating.

605
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:31,160
I been looking all over for you, Terry.
The boss wants you.

606
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:33,518
Right now?

607
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:36,523
Yeah, he just got a call
from ''Mr. Upstairs.''

608
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,723
Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

609
00:43:40,209 --> 00:43:41,961
I'm going to take her home first.

610
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:44,847
I wouldn't do that.
I'll see the little lady home.

611
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:48,164
Tell him I'll come over there
when I'm ready.

612
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:51,002
Hey, wait up!

613
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:54,203
Who was that?

614
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:58,327
I don't know. Some mug.

615
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:02,202
Who was he?

616
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:06,565
You got to quit trying to find out
about Joey. lt ain't safe.

617
00:44:06,649 --> 00:44:08,685
I'm telling you it ain't safe.

618
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:12,048
Mr. Malloy, I was hoping
I might find you here.

619
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:13,278
Excuse me, Miss.

620
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:16,088
You're being served with a subpoena,
Mr. Malloy.

621
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:17,964
What?

622
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:21,564
Be at the State House, Courtroom 9,
10:00 Friday morning.

623
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:24,523
I told you I don't know nothing about that.

624
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:26,406
You can bring a lawyer if you wish.

625
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:29,481
You're privileged under the constitution
to protect yourself...

626
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:32,925
...against questions which might
implicate you in any crimes.

627
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:36,080
You know what they're asking me to do?

628
00:44:36,169 --> 00:44:39,047
All we want you to do, Mr. Malloy,
is tell the truth.

629
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:43,607
Goodnight, kid. Nice wedding.

630
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:49,801
What are you going to do?

631
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:54,439
I ain't going to eat cheese
for no cop and that's for sure.

632
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,121
lt was Johnny Friendly
who had Joey killed, wasn't it?

633
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:05,281
He had him killed or
he had something to do with it, didn't he?

634
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,360
He and your big brother Charley?

635
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:11,041
You can't tell me, can you,
because you're a part of it.

636
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:14,764
Because you're just as bad as
the worst of them. Tell me the truth.

637
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:17,409
You better go back to that school
out in daisyland.

638
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:20,242
You're driving yourself nuts,
you're driving me nuts.

639
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:23,844
Quit worrying about the truth all the time.
Worry about yourself.

640
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:26,599
I should've known you wouldn't tell me.

641
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:30,364
Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you.
I think he still owns you.

642
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:35,039
No wonder everybody calls you a bum.

643
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:40,243
Don't say that to me, Edie,
don't say that to me now.

644
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:44,083
No wonder.

645
00:45:44,169 --> 00:45:46,160
I'm only trying to help you out.

646
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:49,958
I'm trying to keep you from getting hurt.
What more do you want me to do?

647
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:51,846
-Much more.
-Wait a minute.

648
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:53,487
Much, much, much more.

649
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:56,127
Where are you going?

650
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:27,401
Hi there, Johnny,
I was just coming over there.

651
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:32,204
-Where were you, in Chicago?
-No, I was just on my way over there.

652
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,524
How many times
you been knocked out, Terry?

653
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:37,361
Knocked out? Two times.

654
00:46:37,649 --> 00:46:39,401
That's once too often.

655
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:43,118
Your brains must be rattling.
What you got up there, Chinese bells?

656
00:46:43,249 --> 00:46:46,047
I thought you were gonna
keep an eye on that church meeting.

657
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:48,484
I was there. Nothing was happening.

658
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:51,561
Nothing happening!
Some operator you got yourself there.

659
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:54,243
One more like him,
we'd all be wearing striped pyjamas.

660
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:58,083
I'm telling you, Johnny, it was a
big nothing. The priest did all the talking.

661
00:46:58,169 --> 00:47:01,605
Half an hour later, a certain
Timothy J. Dugan had a secret session...

662
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:05,204
...with the crime commission,
and he done all the talking.

663
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:08,041
Dugan, what does he know?

664
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,877
Just 39 pages of our operation, that's all.

665
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:14,762
Where'd you get that?

666
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:17,921
-I got it.
-The complete works of Timothy J. Dugan.

667
00:47:21,649 --> 00:47:23,560
I knew he had the guts, but I never--

668
00:47:23,649 --> 00:47:26,846
Guts! Why, that crummy pigeon.
He ought to have his neck wrung!

669
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:30,365
That's what we get for mixing
with this punch-drunk brother of yours.

670
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:32,917
He was good for laughs,
but this is business.

671
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:35,364
I don't like anyone goofing off
in my business.

672
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:38,247
-I wasn't--
-Why are you going around with his sister?

673
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:39,648
Just shut up!

674
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:45,166
lt's just the Doyle broad,
she's got him so he doesn't...

675
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:47,080
...know where his feet is anymore.

676
00:47:47,169 --> 00:47:49,000
lt's an unhealthy relationship.

677
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:52,047
-Definitely!
-Get rid of her...

678
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:54,245
...unless you're both tired of living.

679
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,762
-You got her address?
-Yeah.

680
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:58,124
We've got to do something
to muzzle Dugan...

681
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,042
...or he'll raise the biggest stink
this town's ever seen.

682
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:03,165
We got the best muscle on the waterfront.

683
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:05,922
The time to use it is now.
Pronto, if not sooner.

684
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:09,797
You know where you're going? Back in
the hold. No more cushy job in the loft.

685
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:13,643
lt's down in the hold with the sweat gang
till you learn your lesson.

686
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:19,757
Let's go.

687
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:21,368
Wise up!

688
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:02,442
Come on, you're all right. Let's do it.

689
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:04,727
At last an lrish shipment.

690
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:08,518
And loaded to the gunnels
with fine lrish whiskey.

691
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:11,687
You see, Kayo,
the good Lord takes care of us all the time.

692
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:14,283
-That he does.
-Come on out, Kayo, get it up.

693
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,644
All right, take it up. Take it away.

694
00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:21,165
And don't go walking off with any of that!

695
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,922
You know how the boss feels
about individual pilferage.

696
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:25,488
All right, all right.

697
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:29,121
Now you see the advantage
of a little man in a big coat.

698
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:38,167
-Let me see you a minute afterwards.
-What're you here for?

699
00:49:38,249 --> 00:49:41,366
To see that we don't steal
any of Mr. Friendly's precious cargo?

700
00:49:41,449 --> 00:49:44,088
-I want to talk to you.
-Get away from me, will you?

701
00:49:44,169 --> 00:49:46,444
All right. Take it up. Take it away.

702
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:01,919
Kayo, you're a walking distillery.

703
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:11,602
Watch it!

704
00:50:13,529 --> 00:50:14,678
Get a doctor!

705
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:17,723
He don't need a doctor. He needs a priest.

706
00:50:33,129 --> 00:50:35,245
I came down here to keep a promise.

707
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:38,563
I gave Kayo my word
that if he stood up to the Mob...

708
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:41,402
...I'd stand up with him all the way.

709
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:44,320
And now Kayo Dugan is dead.

710
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:47,881
He was one of those fellows
who had the gift for standing up.

711
00:50:47,969 --> 00:50:49,687
This time they fixed him.

712
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:53,079
They fixed him for good this time,
unless it was an accident...

713
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:54,847
...like Big Mac says.

714
00:50:55,729 --> 00:50:59,244
Some people think the Crucifixion
only took place on Calvary.

715
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:01,285
They better wise up.

716
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:05,557
Taking Joey Doyle's life to stop him
from testifying is a crucifixion.

717
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:09,439
Dropping a sling on Kayo Dugan...

718
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:12,327
...because he was ready
to spill his guts tomorrow...

719
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:14,525
...that's a crucifixion.

720
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:18,442
Every time the mob
puts the crusher on a good man...

721
00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:22,841
...tries to stop him from doing his duty
as a citizen, it's a crucifixion.

722
00:51:22,929 --> 00:51:26,365
And anybody who sits around
and lets it happen...

723
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:30,408
...keeps silent about something he knows
has happened, shares the guilt of it...

724
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:32,445
...just as much as the Roman soldier...

725
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:35,919
...who pierced the flesh of Our Lord
to see if He was dead.

726
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,084
Go back to your church, Father.

727
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:43,887
Boys, this is my church.

728
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:47,927
lf you don't think Christ is down here
on the waterfront...

729
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:50,125
...you've got another guess coming!

730
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:52,286
Get off this dock, Father!

731
00:51:53,129 --> 00:51:54,608
Tillio, don't do that.

732
00:51:54,689 --> 00:51:57,362
-Whose side are you on, boy?
-Let him finish.

733
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,922
Every morning...

734
00:52:01,169 --> 00:52:03,729
...when the hiring boss blows his whistle...

735
00:52:04,649 --> 00:52:07,243
...Jesus stands alongside you
in the shape-up.

736
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:10,685
He sees why some of you get picked
and some of you get passed over.

737
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:13,602
He sees the family men worrying
about getting their rent...

738
00:52:13,689 --> 00:52:15,998
...and getting food for the wife and kids.

739
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:19,240
He sees you selling your souls
to the mob for a day's pay.

740
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:22,763
The next bum that throws something
deals with me!

741
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:24,726
I don't care if he's twice my size!

742
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,164
What does Christ think
of the easy-money boys...

743
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:29,638
...who do none of the work
and take all the gravy?

744
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,562
How does he feel about
the fellows who wear $150 suits...

745
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:36,722
...and diamond rings on your union dues
and your kickback money?

746
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:41,842
And how does He, who spoke up
without fear against every evil...

747
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:44,407
...feel about your silence?

748
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:46,127
Shut up about that!

749
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:47,762
Just watch this.

750
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:54,278
You see that?

751
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:56,837
You want to know what's wrong
with our waterfront?

752
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:00,478
lt's the love of a lousy buck.
lt's making love of a buck, the cushy job...

753
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:02,525
...more important than the love of man.

754
00:53:02,609 --> 00:53:05,919
lt's forgetting that every fellow
down here is your brother in Christ.

755
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:08,000
But remember, Christ is always with you.

756
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:10,842
Christ's in the shape-up,
in the hatch, in the union hall.

757
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:14,558
He's kneeling right here beside Dugan
and He's saying with all of you:

758
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:19,207
''lf you do it to the least of mine,
you do it to me.''

759
00:53:20,169 --> 00:53:22,160
What they did to Joey and to Dugan...

760
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:25,719
...they're doing to you and you.

761
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:27,918
All of you!

762
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:32,878
And only you, only you with God's help...

763
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:35,642
...have the power
to knock them out for good.

764
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:44,247
Okay, Kayo.

765
00:53:58,769 --> 00:53:59,758
Amen.

766
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:07,768
All right. Come on. Let's go. Break it up.
Let's go to work.

767
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:26,518
Edie, here's Joey's jacket. I'm sure Kayo
would wish you to have it back.

768
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:43,200
I brought you Joey's jacket.

769
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,527
Yours is coming apart.

770
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:52,438
Pigeons.

771
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:55,928
They're nervous.

772
00:55:56,529 --> 00:55:58,759
There was a hawk around here before.

773
00:56:41,809 --> 00:56:44,164
Father, I want to speak to you a minute.

774
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:47,767
Remember what you said about...

775
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:50,966
...Kayo Dugan and keeping
your mouth shut when you know the score.

776
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:52,926
I don't want to hear your confession.

777
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:56,319
I'll dig it out for myself
and use it where it'll do the most good.

778
00:56:56,409 --> 00:56:59,446
-Father Gregory will hear you.
-I don't want to talk....

779
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:13,801
Wait a second, wait a minute.

780
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,164
I just want to talk to you one second.

781
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:19,081
You've got to listen to me.

782
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:22,327
I'm the one that set Joey Doyle up
for the knock off.

783
00:57:30,289 --> 00:57:33,599
Come on, take a walk with me, kid,
and give it to me straight.

784
00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:39,277
There's nothing I haven't heard. Come on.

785
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:53,527
lt started out as a favour.

786
00:57:53,649 --> 00:57:56,368
Favour, who am I kidding?
lt's ''do it or else.''

787
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:59,009
Believe me when I tell you
I just thought they were...

788
00:57:59,129 --> 00:58:02,360
...going to lean on him a bit.
I never thought he'd get knocked off.

789
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,280
I tried to tell Edie the other night.

790
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:06,360
I really tried to, I wanted to tell her.

791
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:09,407
She's the first nice thing
that's ever happened to me.

792
00:58:09,929 --> 00:58:11,681
What are you going to do about it?

793
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:13,725
What do you mean? About telling her?

794
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:16,846
Yes, about telling her.
The commission. Your subpoena.

795
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:18,408
I know you got a subpoena.

796
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:19,683
I don't know.

797
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,678
lt's like carrying a monkey
around on your back.

798
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:24,839
lt's a question of ''who rides who.''

799
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:28,243
lf I spill, my life ain't worth a nickel.

800
00:58:28,529 --> 00:58:31,089
And how much is your soul worth
if you don't?

801
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:34,921
They're asking me to put the finger
on my own brother.

802
00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:39,240
Johnny Friendly used to take me
to ball games when I was a kid.

803
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:40,842
Don't break my heart.

804
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:44,725
I wouldn't care if he gave you
a life pass to the polo grounds.

805
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:47,687
So you've got a brother.
Let me tell you something...

806
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:50,329
...you've got other brothers
getting the short hand...

807
00:58:50,409 --> 00:58:53,924
...while Johnny is getting mustard
on his face at the polo grounds.

808
00:58:54,009 --> 00:58:54,885
Ball games.

809
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:57,608
Listen, if I were you, I would walk right....

810
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:00,918
Never mind.

811
00:59:01,569 --> 00:59:05,642
I'm not asking you to do anything,
your own conscience has to do the asking.

812
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:07,044
Conscience.

813
00:59:09,009 --> 00:59:11,603
-That stuff can drive you nuts.
-Good luck.

814
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:14,720
ls that all you've got to say?

815
00:59:16,449 --> 00:59:17,518
Come here.

816
00:59:21,129 --> 00:59:22,960
Edie called me this morning.

817
00:59:23,409 --> 00:59:25,400
She's coming here to talk to me.

818
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,600
Come on, why don't you tell her?

819
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:32,918
No curves.

820
00:59:36,809 --> 00:59:37,878
Okay.

821
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:41,364
Thanks.

822
01:00:18,169 --> 01:00:20,205
-You?
-Honest to God, Edie....

823
01:00:30,529 --> 01:00:32,679
Believe me, I swear to God, Edie....

824
01:01:24,329 --> 01:01:26,559
Terry, guess who's here?

825
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:29,368
That joker
from the crime commissioner's office.

826
01:01:49,529 --> 01:01:51,918
Suppose I knew a guy
that knocked somebody off...

827
01:01:52,009 --> 01:01:53,840
...you think I ought to turn him in?

828
01:01:53,929 --> 01:01:56,204
You mean call a cop? Are you kidding?

829
01:01:56,289 --> 01:01:58,245
You don't think I ought to turn him in?

830
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:00,240
You was a Golden Warrior once.

831
01:02:01,129 --> 01:02:02,323
That's right.

832
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:05,802
You started the gang.

833
01:02:27,609 --> 01:02:29,042
You looking for me?

834
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,287
No, not exactly.
I was just resting my dogs a minute.

835
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:36,847
On the next investigation we get, I hope
it's got buildings with elevators in them.

836
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:39,489
So far this one's just been climbing stairs.

837
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:41,801
What do you climb them for?

838
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,648
lt's worth it if we can tell
the waterfront story...

839
01:02:44,729 --> 01:02:47,118
...the way the people
have a right to hear it.

840
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:48,528
Don't you think?

841
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,802
Didn't I see you in the Garden
three or four years ago...

842
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:11,800
...with a fellow named Wilson?

843
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:16,637
I thought you were going
to take him that night.

844
01:03:16,729 --> 01:03:18,447
Man, he really dumped you.

845
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:21,363
He dumped me?

846
01:03:24,689 --> 01:03:28,443
What would you say if I told you
I held that bum up for half a round?

847
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:31,637
I could see he was hurt.

848
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:35,879
What did you think I was doing
with them combinations, petting him?

849
01:03:35,969 --> 01:03:37,721
You just couldn't finish him off?

850
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:39,527
Don't monkey around there.

851
01:03:40,409 --> 01:03:42,081
Why didn't you finish him off?

852
01:03:42,169 --> 01:03:45,844
-I was doing a favour for some pals.
-Favour?

853
01:03:47,809 --> 01:03:49,208
That's the way it was.

854
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:50,847
That's the way it was.

855
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:53,568
lf I'd have put him down,
I'd have had a title shot.

856
01:03:53,649 --> 01:03:55,082
I was ready that night.

857
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:57,922
You sure looked it.
That's when I figured it was all over.

858
01:03:58,009 --> 01:04:00,477
lt was all over, except for the lousy bet!

859
01:04:00,649 --> 01:04:01,843
-My own.
-Yeah.

860
01:04:07,369 --> 01:04:09,246
I guess I'd better get going.

861
01:04:09,689 --> 01:04:11,327
Hit those stairs again.

862
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:17,358
Was that a hook or an uppercut
you caught him with that first time?

863
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:21,082
I didn't use no hooks.
I was strictly a short puncher.

864
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:22,727
lt looked like a hook to me.

865
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:26,119
I had that bum all figured out.
He had a good left hand.

866
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:29,201
I let him tag me
with the left hand for a couple of rounds...

867
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:33,168
...so just when he starts, he thinks
he's getting cute, I step inside a jab...

868
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:35,558
...with a left, with a right, with a left.

869
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:39,039
I had him in my arms
and from there on in we were just dancing.

870
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:40,528
And that's a fact!

871
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:44,638
When those guys want to win a bet,
there's nothing they won't stop at.

872
01:04:48,169 --> 01:04:49,648
I didn't hear them, boss...

873
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:52,289
...but I seen them nose to nose,
like pair of lovers.

874
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:54,007
The flatfoot was eating it up.

875
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:57,047
So they've been seen together
and he smiled at her.

876
01:04:57,129 --> 01:04:59,006
That doesn't mean he's going to talk.

877
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:02,081
There is no evidence
until he gives public testimony.

878
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:04,399
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley.

879
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:06,885
That's what we kept you around here for.

880
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,244
How do we keep him
from giving this testimony?

881
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:12,639
Ain't that what you call
''the main order of business''?

882
01:05:12,729 --> 01:05:14,048
He's a good kid.

883
01:05:14,249 --> 01:05:15,762
-You know that.
-He's a bum.

884
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:18,966
After all the days I gave him in the loft,
he's got no gratitude.

885
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:20,084
Shut up!

886
01:05:21,289 --> 01:05:23,564
I'm conducting this investigation.

887
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,278
This girl and the father,
they got their hooks...

888
01:05:29,369 --> 01:05:32,805
...in the kid so deep he doesn't
even know which end is up any more.

889
01:05:32,889 --> 01:05:35,164
I ain't interested in his mental condition.

890
01:05:35,249 --> 01:05:38,286
All I want to know is:
is he D and D or is he a canary?

891
01:05:40,889 --> 01:05:43,403
-I wish I knew.
-So do I, Charley.

892
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:45,603
For your sake.

893
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:53,448
What do you want me to do?

894
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:56,487
lt's simple. Drive him out
to this place we've been using...

895
01:05:56,569 --> 01:06:00,448
...try to straighten him out on the way.
lf you don't, give him to Gerry G.

896
01:06:00,529 --> 01:06:01,928
You can't do that.

897
01:06:02,689 --> 01:06:06,477
Maybe the boy is out of line,
but he's just a confused kid!

898
01:06:06,569 --> 01:06:08,002
Confused kid!

899
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:13,962
First he crosses me in public
and gets away with it...

900
01:06:14,049 --> 01:06:17,405
...then the next joker, pretty soon
I'm just another fellow around here!

901
01:06:17,489 --> 01:06:19,445
Johnny, I can't do that.

902
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:25,404
Then don't.

903
01:06:35,489 --> 01:06:38,242
-Who do you like in the third?
-lt's got to be New Hope.

904
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:39,444
Definitely.

905
01:06:43,409 --> 01:06:44,444
Johnny...

906
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,681
...it's my kid brother.

907
01:06:47,769 --> 01:06:49,646
That's for you to figure out.

908
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:52,243
You can have it your way
or you can have it his way...

909
01:06:52,329 --> 01:06:54,843
...but you can't have it both ways.
Am I right, Truck?

910
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:56,044
Definitely.

911
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,367
Okay, on your horse...

912
01:07:01,169 --> 01:07:02,488
...deep thinker.

913
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:33,879
Hi, Charley.

914
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:37,839
I'm glad you stopped by for me.
I've been wanting to talk to you.

915
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,442
-Sure, kid.
-Where to?

916
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:41,838
Go to River St. I'll tell you where to stop.

917
01:07:41,929 --> 01:07:43,840
I thought we was going to the Garden?

918
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:46,443
We are, but I want to cover a bet
on the way over.

919
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,089
Besides, this'll give us a chance to talk.

920
01:07:49,689 --> 01:07:52,283
Nobody ever stopped you
from talking, Charley.

921
01:07:55,569 --> 01:07:58,037
The grapevine says that
you got a subpoena.

922
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:01,359
The guys know you're not a cheese-eater.

923
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:04,122
They think you shouldn't be
on the outside so much...

924
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:07,884
...but a little on the inside.
I have a few things for you at the docks.

925
01:08:09,009 --> 01:08:10,237
A steady job...

926
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:13,448
...a couple extra potatoes, that's all I want.

927
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:15,965
That's great when you're a kid, but...

928
01:08:16,049 --> 01:08:18,609
...you're getting on,
you're pushing 30, slugger.

929
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:21,761
You know it's time to think
about getting some ambition.

930
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:26,840
I always figured I'd live
a little bit longer without it.

931
01:08:29,169 --> 01:08:30,443
Maybe.

932
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:40,848
There's a boss loader slot that's
open on the new pier we're opening up.

933
01:08:41,969 --> 01:08:44,278
lt pays six cents on every...

934
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:48,045
...100 pounds that goes in
and every 100 pounds that goes out...

935
01:08:48,129 --> 01:08:50,040
...and you don't have to lift a finger.

936
01:08:50,129 --> 01:08:52,723
That's $200, $300, $400 a week.

937
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:55,682
$400 a week just for the openers.

938
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:58,758
I get all that dough for not doing nothing?

939
01:08:58,849 --> 01:09:01,602
You don't do anything
and you don't say anything.

940
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:03,637
You understand?

941
01:09:09,049 --> 01:09:11,609
There's more to this
than I thought, Charley.

942
01:09:12,809 --> 01:09:14,925
I'm telling you there's a lot more.

943
01:09:15,969 --> 01:09:19,484
You're not thinking of testifying against
some people that we might know?

944
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:21,127
I don't know, Charley.

945
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:23,959
That's what I want to talk to you about.

946
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:27,837
Do you know how much the piers are
worth that we control through the local?

947
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:30,841
Do you think Johnny's going to jeopardise
the whole set-up...

948
01:09:30,929 --> 01:09:34,922
...for one rubber-lipped, ex-tanker
who's walking on his heels? What the....

949
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:36,920
I could've been a lot better.

950
01:09:37,009 --> 01:09:39,045
The point is we don't have much time!

951
01:09:39,129 --> 01:09:41,563
I'm telling you,
I haven't made up my mind yet!

952
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:44,561
Make up your mind
before we get to 437 River St!

953
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:54,440
Before we get to where, Charley?

954
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:03,079
Listen, Terry.
Take the job, no questions. Take it!

955
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:07,765
Terry, take this job, please.

956
01:10:37,889 --> 01:10:39,083
Look, kid....

957
01:10:43,129 --> 01:10:45,040
How much do you weigh, slugger?

958
01:10:46,969 --> 01:10:49,563
When you weighed 168 pounds...

959
01:10:50,849 --> 01:10:52,407
...you were beautiful.

960
01:10:54,449 --> 01:10:56,758
You could have been another Billy Conn.

961
01:10:58,929 --> 01:11:01,079
That skunk we got you for a manager...

962
01:11:02,249 --> 01:11:04,160
...he brought you along too fast.

963
01:11:06,209 --> 01:11:08,643
lt wasn't him, Charley. lt was you.

964
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:10,487
Remember that night in the Garden?

965
01:11:10,569 --> 01:11:14,323
You came down to my dressing room
and said, ''Kid, this ain't your night.

966
01:11:14,409 --> 01:11:16,559
''We're going for the price on Wilson.''

967
01:11:17,369 --> 01:11:18,768
You remember that?

968
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:21,367
''This ain't your night.''

969
01:11:22,209 --> 01:11:25,007
My night! I could have taken Wilson apart!

970
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:29,526
So what happens, he gets the title shot
outdoors in the ball park...

971
01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:32,646
...and what do I get?
A one-way ticket to Palookaville!

972
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:34,401
You was my brother, Charley.

973
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:36,957
You should have looked out
for me a little bit.

974
01:11:37,049 --> 01:11:39,768
You should've taken care of me
a little so I wouldn't...

975
01:11:39,849 --> 01:11:42,158
...have to take dives for short-end money.

976
01:11:42,249 --> 01:11:44,638
I had some bets down for you.
You saw some money.

977
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:47,368
You don't understand,
I could have had class!

978
01:11:47,449 --> 01:11:49,360
I could have been a contender.

979
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:51,321
I could have been somebody.

980
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:53,842
lnstead of a bum...

981
01:11:54,369 --> 01:11:56,644
...which is what I am. Let's face it.

982
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,088
lt was you, Charley!

983
01:12:10,249 --> 01:12:11,238
Okay.

984
01:12:15,209 --> 01:12:16,562
I'll tell them...

985
01:12:17,809 --> 01:12:19,561
...I couldn't find you.

986
01:12:19,649 --> 01:12:21,719
Ten to one they won't believe me.

987
01:12:27,769 --> 01:12:29,202
Here, you take this.

988
01:12:30,849 --> 01:12:32,487
You're going to need it.

989
01:12:34,369 --> 01:12:35,597
You, pull over.

990
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,127
Take me to the Garden.

991
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:26,841
Stay away from me!

992
01:13:32,289 --> 01:13:33,119
Edie?

993
01:13:35,129 --> 01:13:37,359
Come on, open the door, please!

994
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:38,438
Stop it!

995
01:13:42,009 --> 01:13:43,647
I want you to stay away from me.

996
01:13:43,729 --> 01:13:46,801
I know what you want me to do
but I ain't doing it, so forget it.

997
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,880
I don't want you to do anything.

998
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:51,284
You let your conscience
tell you what to do.

999
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:54,247
Shut up about that conscience,
that's all I've been hearing!

1000
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,605
I never mentioned the word before.
You just stay away from me!

1001
01:13:57,689 --> 01:13:59,361
Edie, you love me.

1002
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:03,958
I didn't say I didn't love you,
I said stay away from me!

1003
01:14:04,049 --> 01:14:06,768
-I want you to stay with me.
-Stay away from me!

1004
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:40,962
Terry!

1005
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:47,085
Terry, your brother's down here!
He wants to see you!

1006
01:14:49,409 --> 01:14:50,398
Charley?

1007
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,047
Your brother's down here.

1008
01:15:03,089 --> 01:15:04,522
Come on down here.

1009
01:15:04,769 --> 01:15:06,248
He wants to see you.

1010
01:15:10,569 --> 01:15:11,888
Come on down!

1011
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:16,082
-What is it Terry?
-Charley, he's in trouble.

1012
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:17,364
Be careful.

1013
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:25,798
Charley!

1014
01:15:26,449 --> 01:15:27,518
Terry?

1015
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:32,727
Terry! Your brother's down here!

1016
01:15:35,009 --> 01:15:36,727
Do you hear what I hear?

1017
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:39,558
Terry!

1018
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:56,480
That's the same way they called Andy,
the night I lost him.

1019
01:15:57,009 --> 01:15:59,569
Edie, be careful! Edie, be careful!

1020
01:17:50,489 --> 01:17:51,842
They got Charley.

1021
01:17:52,289 --> 01:17:54,962
Terry, I'm frightened.
Let's get out of here, please.

1022
01:17:55,049 --> 01:17:57,927
First Joey, then Dugan,
and now Charley, and next....

1023
01:17:58,249 --> 01:18:00,809
Please, Terry,
some place where we can live in peace.

1024
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:03,687
I'm going to take it out of their skulls.

1025
01:18:07,409 --> 01:18:08,478
Charley...

1026
01:18:11,409 --> 01:18:13,969
...I'm going to take it out of their skulls.

1027
01:18:14,169 --> 01:18:16,080
Terry, they'll kill you, too.

1028
01:18:16,649 --> 01:18:19,561
Go get the father.
Tell him to take care of Charley.

1029
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:23,287
And then come back here
and stay with him till he gets here.

1030
01:18:23,369 --> 01:18:26,042
Terry, please don't do anything, please!

1031
01:18:27,929 --> 01:18:30,648
For God's sake,
don't leave him alone here long!

1032
01:18:32,689 --> 01:18:34,805
-Please, Terry.
-Do what I tell you.

1033
01:18:58,889 --> 01:19:01,357
-Where's John Friendly?
-He's not here now.

1034
01:19:38,049 --> 01:19:39,277
Give me a shot.

1035
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:41,078
Take it easy.

1036
01:19:41,169 --> 01:19:43,603
Don't give me no advice, give me the shot.

1037
01:19:49,049 --> 01:19:51,517
Why don't you go home
before Big John gets here?

1038
01:19:51,609 --> 01:19:53,281
Just give me a whiskey.

1039
01:19:59,809 --> 01:20:01,606
Stick around, Tillio.

1040
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:08,568
There, sit down.

1041
01:20:19,489 --> 01:20:21,320
Get out of that phone booth!

1042
01:20:42,769 --> 01:20:44,600
Stay where you are!

1043
01:20:51,649 --> 01:20:53,321
I want to see you, Terry.

1044
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:55,247
I'm right in front of you.

1045
01:20:59,049 --> 01:21:01,119
Don't give me a hard time, Terry.

1046
01:21:05,929 --> 01:21:07,282
What do you want?

1047
01:21:09,969 --> 01:21:11,038
Your gun.

1048
01:21:11,169 --> 01:21:12,727
Go and chase yourself.

1049
01:21:12,809 --> 01:21:13,844
Give me the gun.

1050
01:21:13,929 --> 01:21:15,123
You go to hell.

1051
01:21:17,089 --> 01:21:19,000
-What did you say?
-Go to hell.

1052
01:21:23,929 --> 01:21:26,807
-Sorry, let me help you up.
-Get your hands off me!

1053
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:28,726
Now what am I going to do?

1054
01:21:28,809 --> 01:21:31,607
You want to be a brave man
by firing lead into another man?

1055
01:21:31,689 --> 01:21:34,044
-lt's none of your business!
-That's being brave!

1056
01:21:34,129 --> 01:21:35,528
Mind your own business!

1057
01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:37,600
Shooting a man isn't being brave!

1058
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:39,168
lt's none of your business!

1059
01:21:39,249 --> 01:21:41,399
Do you want to hurt Johnny Friendly?

1060
01:21:42,769 --> 01:21:44,407
Do you want to fix him?

1061
01:21:44,889 --> 01:21:47,449
-Do you really want to finish him?
-What do you think?

1062
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:49,918
For what he did to Charley
and a dozen other men?

1063
01:21:50,009 --> 01:21:53,922
Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here
in the jungle. That's what he wants.

1064
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:56,762
He'll hit you in the head
and plead self-defence.

1065
01:21:57,049 --> 01:22:00,007
You'll fight him in the courtroom
tomorrow with the truth.

1066
01:22:00,089 --> 01:22:01,602
As you know the truth.

1067
01:22:09,849 --> 01:22:11,646
Now you get rid of that gun.

1068
01:22:11,729 --> 01:22:15,119
Unless you haven't the guts,
and if you haven't, hold onto it!

1069
01:22:19,889 --> 01:22:21,117
Give me a beer.

1070
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:32,685
Do you want a beer? Make it two.

1071
01:23:11,009 --> 01:23:14,001
You mean to sit there and tell me
that your local takes in...

1072
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:17,047
...$65,500 every year...

1073
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:19,525
...and keeps no financial records?

1074
01:23:19,609 --> 01:23:21,281
Sure. We got records.

1075
01:23:21,369 --> 01:23:22,597
Where are they?

1076
01:23:22,889 --> 01:23:25,847
We was robbed last night,
and we can't find no books.

1077
01:23:26,849 --> 01:23:28,919
-You know you're under oath?
-Sure.

1078
01:23:37,529 --> 01:23:40,441
lsn't it odd to you that
five different waterfront locals...

1079
01:23:40,529 --> 01:23:42,440
...were broken into last night?

1080
01:23:42,529 --> 01:23:46,283
And the only item missing from all
of them was the financial records?

1081
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:49,361
What do you mean, odd?
Like I told you, we was robbed.

1082
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:56,842
That's all for now.

1083
01:24:01,649 --> 01:24:03,207
Call the next witness.

1084
01:24:04,929 --> 01:24:06,681
Before you call the next witness...

1085
01:24:06,769 --> 01:24:10,239
...are all the officers of Local 37 4
present this morning?

1086
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:15,280
Will the following please rise
as their names are called?

1087
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:19,119
Mr. Michael J. Skelly,
also known as Johnny Friendly, President.

1088
01:24:21,249 --> 01:24:23,479
Mr. Lewis O. Janotta, Vice President.

1089
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:27,960
Mr. Daniel D. Coogan, Financial Secretary.

1090
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,759
Mr. Mladen Sokolivitch, Delegate.

1091
01:24:31,049 --> 01:24:33,199
Mr. Tillio A. Rodelli, Delegate.

1092
01:24:33,289 --> 01:24:35,041
Recording Secretary.

1093
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:40,758
Thank you, gentlemen.

1094
01:24:40,849 --> 01:24:42,760
-Next witness.
-Mr. Malloy.

1095
01:24:54,249 --> 01:24:55,602
Raise your right hand.

1096
01:24:55,689 --> 01:24:57,964
-Name, please.
-Terry Malloy.

1097
01:24:58,049 --> 01:25:00,802
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and only the truth?

1098
01:25:00,889 --> 01:25:01,685
-Right.
-I do.

1099
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:03,522
-I do.
-Be seated, please.

1100
01:25:05,249 --> 01:25:06,568
Mr. Malloy...

1101
01:25:07,129 --> 01:25:10,041
...is it true that the night Joey Doyle
was found dead...

1102
01:25:10,129 --> 01:25:13,565
...you were the last one to see him
before he was pushed from the roof?

1103
01:25:13,649 --> 01:25:14,684
Yes.

1104
01:25:14,769 --> 01:25:16,600
ls it true you went immediately--

1105
01:25:16,689 --> 01:25:18,964
Wait! Except for the guys
that pushed him off.

1106
01:25:19,049 --> 01:25:21,688
ls it true you went
immediately to the Friendly bar...

1107
01:25:21,769 --> 01:25:25,318
...and expressed your feelings
about the murder to Mr. Johnny Friendly?

1108
01:25:25,409 --> 01:25:26,728
John Friendly, right.

1109
01:25:26,809 --> 01:25:28,003
<i>Mr. Malloy...</i>

1110
01:25:28,449 --> 01:25:31,919
<i>...can you tell me whether</i>
<i>Mr. Friendly, or I should say, Mr. Skelly...</i>

1111
01:25:32,009 --> 01:25:36,002
<i>...said anything to you to indicate his</i>
<i>responsibility in getting rid of Joey Doyle?</i>

1112
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:36,839
<i>Right.</i>

1113
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:40,001
<i>Would you say</i>
<i>that Mr. Friendly made it clear to you...</i>

1114
01:25:40,129 --> 01:25:43,121
<i>...it was absolutely necessary</i>
<i>he murder Joey Doyle in order...</i>

1115
01:25:43,209 --> 01:25:44,881
<i>...to maintain his control...</i>

1116
01:25:44,969 --> 01:25:48,166
<i>...on the docks of the waterfront locals!</i>
<i>Is that correct?</i>

1117
01:25:48,249 --> 01:25:49,887
Will there be anything else?

1118
01:25:49,969 --> 01:25:52,688
Yes, Sidney, if Mr. Friendly calls, I'm out.

1119
01:25:53,369 --> 01:25:55,837
-Anytime today?
-lf he calls ever, I'm out!

1120
01:25:56,009 --> 01:25:57,078
Very well.

1121
01:25:58,009 --> 01:25:59,647
Thank you, Mr. Malloy.

1122
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:03,048
You've done more
than break the Joey Doyle case.

1123
01:26:04,769 --> 01:26:07,966
We've begun to make it possible
for honest men to work the docks...

1124
01:26:08,049 --> 01:26:10,358
...with job security and peace of mind.

1125
01:26:12,329 --> 01:26:14,638
You may step down. That's all for now.

1126
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,040
Mr. Michael J. Skelly, please.

1127
01:26:28,849 --> 01:26:31,044
You just dug your own grave. Go fall in it.

1128
01:26:31,129 --> 01:26:33,689
You're dead on this waterfront
and every waterfront...

1129
01:26:33,769 --> 01:26:35,407
...from Boston to New Orleans.

1130
01:26:35,489 --> 01:26:37,366
You don't drive a truck or a cab...

1131
01:26:37,449 --> 01:26:41,237
...you don't push a baggage rack
you don't work no place, you're dead!

1132
01:26:58,409 --> 01:27:01,560
Will you quit following me?
Why don't you get off my tail?

1133
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:04,641
Orders. You're hot.
You ought to be glad we're following you.

1134
01:27:04,729 --> 01:27:06,287
You're making me feel like a canary.

1135
01:27:06,369 --> 01:27:07,643
-Well....
-Lay off.

1136
01:27:11,009 --> 01:27:12,328
Hi, Cheeky.

1137
01:27:14,649 --> 01:27:16,321
Who's your friend?

1138
01:27:48,249 --> 01:27:51,241
I made some hot coffee.
I thought you might want some.

1139
01:27:55,409 --> 01:27:57,081
Anyway, it's all over.

1140
01:27:58,689 --> 01:28:00,839
My friends don't want to talk to me.

1141
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,079
Are you sure they're your friends?

1142
01:28:10,769 --> 01:28:12,202
I'll see you later.

1143
01:28:27,689 --> 01:28:29,486
Hey, champ, how's the kid.

1144
01:28:33,369 --> 01:28:34,768
What's with him?

1145
01:28:49,289 --> 01:28:51,280
A pigeon for a pigeon!

1146
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:21,318
Terry.

1147
01:29:36,969 --> 01:29:37,924
The kid.

1148
01:29:41,169 --> 01:29:42,158
Tommy?

1149
01:29:44,849 --> 01:29:46,840
What did he have to do that for?

1150
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:50,048
Every one of them.

1151
01:29:51,449 --> 01:29:55,044
Terry, there's no place that's safe
for you now on the waterfront.

1152
01:29:55,809 --> 01:29:57,037
Maybe inland...

1153
01:29:57,449 --> 01:29:59,121
...out west some place...

1154
01:29:59,209 --> 01:30:00,278
...a farm.

1155
01:30:01,489 --> 01:30:02,478
A farm?

1156
01:30:02,969 --> 01:30:07,087
You could do anything, as long as
you're away from Johnny Friendly.

1157
01:30:07,169 --> 01:30:09,364
You tried to help the longshoremen...

1158
01:30:09,449 --> 01:30:12,725
...and they just turn their backs
and stick to their stupid D and D!

1159
01:30:12,809 --> 01:30:15,881
Are they taking chances for you?
Why should you?

1160
01:30:16,169 --> 01:30:18,603
You're not even listening to me, are you?

1161
01:30:26,329 --> 01:30:27,967
You're going down there.

1162
01:30:28,769 --> 01:30:32,364
Just because Johnny Friendly warned you
not to, you're going down there.

1163
01:30:32,449 --> 01:30:35,998
You think you got to prove
that you're not afraid of them!

1164
01:30:36,089 --> 01:30:38,000
Well, go ahead, get it over with.

1165
01:30:38,089 --> 01:30:41,126
Go down and get yourself killed
you stupid, pigheaded....

1166
01:30:41,209 --> 01:30:43,200
What are you trying to prove?

1167
01:30:46,329 --> 01:30:48,206
They always said I was a bum.

1168
01:30:50,009 --> 01:30:51,727
Well, I ain't a bum, Edie.

1169
01:30:53,089 --> 01:30:55,557
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt nobody.

1170
01:30:56,089 --> 01:30:58,159
I'm just going to go down there...

1171
01:30:58,569 --> 01:31:00,082
...and get my rights.

1172
01:31:44,969 --> 01:31:46,960
Everybody works today!

1173
01:32:05,169 --> 01:32:06,158
Wolfgang.

1174
01:32:07,329 --> 01:32:08,398
Hendricks.

1175
01:32:09,209 --> 01:32:10,358
Padowski.

1176
01:32:11,689 --> 01:32:12,678
Martin.

1177
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:14,558
Dalton.

1178
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:15,798
Wurthy.

1179
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:17,524
Hauffman.

1180
01:32:19,889 --> 01:32:23,359
-What do you think?
-That ain't such a bad picture of you, boss.

1181
01:32:23,489 --> 01:32:25,719
Stop breathing that clam sauce on me.

1182
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:29,528
I wish you'd let me
go to work on that cheese-eater.

1183
01:32:29,609 --> 01:32:31,281
I'd top the bum off lovely.

1184
01:32:31,369 --> 01:32:33,485
Wait'll we get off this front page.

1185
01:32:33,569 --> 01:32:34,797
Then he's mine.

1186
01:32:35,569 --> 01:32:36,684
I want him.

1187
01:32:37,729 --> 01:32:39,447
You hear that? He's mine.

1188
01:32:45,249 --> 01:32:48,719
Where are them cops of yours, stoolie?
You're going to need them.

1189
01:32:54,169 --> 01:32:56,399
You're still short in the hatch, Mac.

1190
01:32:58,129 --> 01:33:00,723
Spec. Bring me the first man you see.

1191
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:03,398
You.

1192
01:33:07,569 --> 01:33:09,639
Here's your man.

1193
01:33:12,409 --> 01:33:15,003
You want more of the same?
Come back tomorrow.

1194
01:33:18,369 --> 01:33:19,768
All right, that's it.

1195
01:33:41,289 --> 01:33:45,521
I hope that bum comes down here.
I'd love if he comes down here.

1196
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,320
Did you ever hear of the Sullivan Law?

1197
01:33:48,409 --> 01:33:51,640
They'll be down on us for
the slightest infraction now, anything.

1198
01:33:51,729 --> 01:33:53,560
I'm going to be indicted any minute!

1199
01:33:53,649 --> 01:33:55,765
Come on, gimme.

1200
01:33:57,729 --> 01:33:59,720
Will you get it through your heads...

1201
01:33:59,809 --> 01:34:02,323
...they're dusting off the hot seat for me!

1202
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,925
We're a law-abiding union.

1203
01:34:07,369 --> 01:34:08,484
Understand?

1204
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:45,362
Friendly!

1205
01:34:46,649 --> 01:34:48,719
John Friendly, come out of there!

1206
01:34:55,169 --> 01:34:57,160
You want to know the trouble with you?

1207
01:34:57,249 --> 01:35:00,400
You think it makes you a big man
if you give the answers.

1208
01:35:00,489 --> 01:35:03,322
At the right time I'll catch up with you.
Think about that.

1209
01:35:03,409 --> 01:35:06,401
-Now, go on, beat it. Don't push your luck.
-Wait a minute.

1210
01:35:06,489 --> 01:35:10,004
You take them heaters away from you
and you're nothing, you know that?

1211
01:35:10,089 --> 01:35:11,920
You'll talk yourself in the river!

1212
01:35:12,009 --> 01:35:14,728
You take the good goods away
and the kickbacks...

1213
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:18,040
...and shakedown cabbage
and the pistoleros and you're nothing!

1214
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:21,201
Your guts is all in your wallet
and your trigger finger!

1215
01:35:21,409 --> 01:35:23,047
You ratted on us, Terry!

1216
01:35:23,249 --> 01:35:26,366
From where you stand, maybe.
But I'm standing over here now!

1217
01:35:26,449 --> 01:35:29,839
I was ratting on myself all them years,
I didn't even know it.

1218
01:35:30,009 --> 01:35:32,204
You gave it to Joey, you gave it to Dugan...

1219
01:35:32,289 --> 01:35:34,962
...and you gave it to Charley
who was one of your own.

1220
01:35:35,049 --> 01:35:37,927
You think you're God Almighty,
but you know what you are?

1221
01:35:38,009 --> 01:35:39,328
You're a cheap...

1222
01:35:39,409 --> 01:35:41,923
...lousy, dirty, stinking mug...

1223
01:35:42,289 --> 01:35:44,405
...and I'm glad what I done to you!

1224
01:35:44,689 --> 01:35:45,883
You hear that?

1225
01:35:45,969 --> 01:35:47,687
I'm glad what I done!

1226
01:35:48,529 --> 01:35:50,997
And I'm going to keep on doing it till I get--

1227
01:35:52,049 --> 01:35:52,720
Come on, come on.

1228
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:22,640
That boy fights like he used to.

1229
01:36:33,809 --> 01:36:35,925
-They'll kill him.
-lt's a massacre.

1230
01:36:36,009 --> 01:36:37,840
He's one of theirs anyway.

1231
01:36:41,689 --> 01:36:43,805
-What are we waiting for?
-Let's go!

1232
01:36:45,769 --> 01:36:46,963
That's enough.

1233
01:36:47,929 --> 01:36:49,567
Just let him lay there.

1234
01:37:11,969 --> 01:37:13,163
What happened?

1235
01:37:16,609 --> 01:37:18,122
Jimmy, what happened?

1236
01:37:25,609 --> 01:37:27,088
Where are you going?

1237
01:37:27,329 --> 01:37:28,398
Let me by.

1238
01:37:43,249 --> 01:37:44,398
You want him?

1239
01:37:47,089 --> 01:37:48,442
You can have him!

1240
01:37:54,209 --> 01:37:55,927
The little rat's yours.

1241
01:38:07,489 --> 01:38:09,684
Get some fresh water!

1242
01:38:12,969 --> 01:38:14,084
Terry.

1243
01:38:16,249 --> 01:38:17,523
Who's in charge here?

1244
01:38:17,609 --> 01:38:19,804
Yours truly is in charge here.

1245
01:38:19,889 --> 01:38:22,767
We got to get this ship out of here.
lt's costing us money.

1246
01:38:22,849 --> 01:38:24,043
Blow your whistle.

1247
01:38:24,129 --> 01:38:26,120
All right you guys, get to work!

1248
01:38:27,049 --> 01:38:28,038
Come on!

1249
01:38:28,649 --> 01:38:31,527
-What goes?
-I'll have them working in two minutes.

1250
01:38:31,929 --> 01:38:34,318
He better get these men to work.

1251
01:38:36,609 --> 01:38:39,077
Come on, you guys, on the double!
Get to work!

1252
01:38:39,169 --> 01:38:42,081
Come on. Get in there. Get in there.

1253
01:38:43,049 --> 01:38:45,927
-How about Terry?
-lf he don't work, we don't work.

1254
01:38:46,089 --> 01:38:48,125
Work! He can't even walk!

1255
01:38:48,649 --> 01:38:51,641
You want to know who works?
The ones I pick to work.

1256
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:54,323
Now get going.
Come on all of you, get in there.

1257
01:38:56,369 --> 01:38:58,041
Come on, get out here.

1258
01:38:58,169 --> 01:39:00,364
Come on, Pop, on the double,
you work today.

1259
01:39:00,449 --> 01:39:02,838
All my life you pushed me around.

1260
01:39:03,009 --> 01:39:04,442
Come on.

1261
01:39:17,049 --> 01:39:18,880
Come on, you walk in with them.

1262
01:39:26,929 --> 01:39:30,968
lf Terry walks in, we walk in with him.
They're waiting for him to walk in.

1263
01:39:40,929 --> 01:39:42,601
Did you hear that, Terry?

1264
01:39:43,889 --> 01:39:46,323
Terry, did you hear that?

1265
01:39:46,409 --> 01:39:47,398
Yeah.

1266
01:39:48,209 --> 01:39:52,202
You lost the battle,
but you have a chance to win the war.

1267
01:39:53,929 --> 01:39:55,760
-What do I have to do?
-Walk.

1268
01:39:56,249 --> 01:39:57,443
Can you walk?

1269
01:39:58,569 --> 01:40:00,002
-Walk.
-Yes, walk.

1270
01:40:01,969 --> 01:40:03,687
To the pier, I mean.

1271
01:40:03,769 --> 01:40:06,329
-We'll walk in with you.
-So the shippers can see...

1272
01:40:06,409 --> 01:40:08,877
...we'll take no more orders
from Johnny Friendly.

1273
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:12,723
Then it'll give us back our union,
so we can run it on the up and up.

1274
01:40:13,249 --> 01:40:16,161
Johnny Friendly's laying odds
that you won't get up.

1275
01:40:19,489 --> 01:40:22,401
What are you standing around for?
Come on, help me!

1276
01:40:23,489 --> 01:40:24,842
Come on, you guys.

1277
01:40:26,529 --> 01:40:29,805
Put me on my feet. Come on.

1278
01:40:40,849 --> 01:40:42,043
How you doing?

1279
01:40:44,369 --> 01:40:45,961
Am I on my feet?

1280
01:40:47,329 --> 01:40:48,808
You're on your feet.

1281
01:40:51,289 --> 01:40:53,678
-I don't think I'm gonna make it.
-Terry!

1282
01:40:54,729 --> 01:40:55,718
You can.

1283
01:40:59,369 --> 01:41:02,486
Just finish what you started. You can.

1284
01:41:10,089 --> 01:41:11,408
Give me my hook.

1285
01:41:11,729 --> 01:41:14,004
Look, for God's sake,
what're you trying to do?

1286
01:41:14,089 --> 01:41:16,364
Take your hands off him. Keep going.

1287
01:41:21,289 --> 01:41:22,608
Leave him alone!

1288
01:42:22,929 --> 01:42:25,079
All right, let's go to work!

1289
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:39,924
Where you guys going? Wait a minute.

1290
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:43,925
I'll remember this.
I'll remember every one of you!

1291
01:42:45,369 --> 01:42:47,599
I'll be back! Don't you forget that!

1292
01:42:48,049 --> 01:42:49,528
I'll be back!
