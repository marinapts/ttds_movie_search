1
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,029
Yes, this is Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California.

2
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:33,168
It's about 5:00 in the morning.

3
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:35,093
That's the homicide squad...

4
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:37,645
complete with detectives
and newspaper men.

5
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:41,643
A murder has been reported from
one of those great big houses...

6
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:44,018
in the ten thousand block.

7
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:46,987
You'll read about it
in the late editions, I'm sure.

8
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:50,770
You'll get it over your radio
and see it on television...

9
00:01:50,836 --> 00:01:55,308
because an old-time star is
involved-- one of the biggest.

10
00:01:56,275 --> 00:02:00,104
But before you hear it all distorted
and blown out of proportion...

11
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:03,375
before those Hollywood columnists
get their hands on it...

12
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:06,889
maybe you'd like to hear the facts--
the whole truth.

13
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:11,782
If so, you've come
to the right party.

14
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:13,711
You see, the body of a young man
was found...

15
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:16,078
floating in the pool
of her mansion...

16
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:19,405
with two shots in his back
and one in his stomach.

17
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,326
Nobody important, really.

18
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,220
Just a movie writer with a couple
of pictures to his credit.

19
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:30,084
The poor dope.
He always wanted a pool.

20
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,776
Well, in the end
he got himself a pool...

21
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,398
only the price turned out to be
a little high.

22
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:43,234
Let's go back about six months and
find the day when it all started.

23
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:47,235
I was living in an apartment house
above Franklin and Ivar.

24
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:49,729
Things were tough at the moment.

25
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:53,600
I hadn't worked in a studio
for a long time.

26
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,700
So I sat there, grinding out
original stories, two a week.

27
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,729
Only I seemed to have lost my touch.

28
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:04,484
Maybe they weren't original enough.

29
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:07,302
Maybe they were too original.

30
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:10,335
All I know is,
they didn't sell.

31
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:13,958
Yeah?

32
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:25,439
- Joseph C. Gillis?
- That's right.

33
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,411
We've come for the car.

34
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:29,827
What car?

35
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:34,170
1946 Plymouth convertible,
California license 40-R-116.

36
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,651
Where are the keys?

37
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:38,430
Why should I give you the keys?

38
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,288
Because the company's
played ball long enough...

39
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:43,868
because you're three payments behind,
and because we got a court order.

40
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:45,313
Now, come on. The keys.

41
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,288
Or do you want us to jack it up
and haul it away?

42
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:49,947
Relax, fans.
The car isn't here.

43
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,807
Oh, is that so?

44
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:54,840
I loaned it to a friend.
He took it down to Palm Springs.

45
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:56,669
Had to get away for his health,
I suppose.

46
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,908
If you don't believe me,
look in the garage.

47
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:02,489
Sure, sure, we believe you.
Only now we want you to believe us!

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,683
That car better be here tomorrow
or there's gonna be fireworks.

49
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:09,021
- You say the cutest things.
- Ha.

50
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,811
Well, I needed about $290...

51
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:25,243
and I needed it real quick,
or I'd lose my car.

52
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:30,424
It wasn't in Palm Springs,
and it wasn't in the garage.

53
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:33,241
I was way ahead
of the finance company.

54
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:36,787
I knew they'd be coming around,
and I wasn't taking any chances.

55
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:42,260
So I kept it across the street in a
lot behind Rudy's Shoeshine Parlor.

56
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,395
Rudy never asked any questions
about your finances.

57
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:48,727
He'd just look at your heels
and know the score.

58
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:56,151
I had an original story
kicking around Paramount.

59
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,866
My agent told me it was
dead as a doornail.

60
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:02,034
But I knew a big shot over there
who 'd always liked me.

61
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:04,558
The time had come to take
a little advantage of it.

62
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,605
His name was Sheldrake.

63
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:10,868
He was a smart producer
with a set of ulcers to prove it.

64
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:15,887
All right, Gillis, you've got five
minutes. What's your story about?

65
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:18,892
It's about a baseball player,
a rookie shortstop batting 347.

66
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:21,233
- Uh-huh.
- Poor kid was mixed up in a holdup.

67
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,845
But he's trying to go straight.
Except some gamblers won't let him.

68
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:28,264
So they tell the kid he's got to
throw the World Series or else, huh?

69
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,412
More or less, except for the end.
I've got a gimmick that's real good.

70
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:31,911
Uh-huh. You got a title?

71
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:34,026
Bases Loaded.
There's a 40-page outline.

72
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:37,197
Call Readers Department. Find out
what they have on Bases Loaded.

73
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,413
They're pretty hot about it over at
Twentieth, except Zanuck's all wet.

74
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:44,750
Can you see Ty Power as a shortstop?

75
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,467
You've got the best man for it
right here on this lot. Alan Ladd.

76
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:51,148
Be a good change of pace for Ladd.
Another thing, it's simple to shoot.

77
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:55,754
Lots of outdoor stuff. You could
make it all for under a million.

78
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,277
- Excuse me.
- A great part for Bill Demarest--

79
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,408
a trainer, an old-time player who
got beamed, goes out of his head.

80
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:03,907
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.

81
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:06,796
On that Bases Loaded, I covered it
with a two-page synopsis.

82
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,065
- Thank you.
- But I wouldn't bother.

83
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,987
- What's wrong with it?
- It's from hunger.

84
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:12,808
Nothing for Ladd?

85
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:15,593
It's just a rehash of something
that wasn't very good to begin with.

86
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,562
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet
Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.

87
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:21,537
This is Miss Kramer.

88
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:25,222
The name is Schaefer.
Betty Schaefer.

89
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,225
Right now I wish I could crawl
in a hole and pull it in after me.

90
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:29,956
If I could be of any help--

91
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:33,473
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I
just didn't think it was any good.

92
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:35,585
I found it flat and trite.

93
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:39,715
Exactly what kind of material do you
recommend? James Joyce? Dostoyevsky?

94
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,988
I just think that pictures
should say a little something.

95
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:45,089
Oh, one of the message kids.
Just a story won't do.

96
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,818
You'd have turned down
Gone With the Wind.

97
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:51,197
No, that was me. I said, "Who wants
to see a Civil War picture?"

98
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:57,018
Perhaps I hated it because
I'd always heard you had talent.

99
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:59,166
That was last year. This year
I'm trying to earn a living.

100
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:02,498
So you take plot 27-A,
make it glossy, make it slick--

101
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:05,913
Those are dirty words.
You sound like New York critics.

102
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:09,982
- That's all, Miss Kramer-- Schaefer.
- Good-bye, Mr. Gillis.

103
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:13,313
Next time I'll write you
The Naked and the Dead.

104
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:18,267
Well, it seems like Zanuck
has got himself a baseball picture.

105
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,818
I don't want you to think I thought
this would win any Academy Award.

106
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,890
Of course, we're always
looking for a Betty Hutton.

107
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:27,928
- Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
- Frankly, no.

108
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:32,670
Wait. If we made it a girls'
softball team, put in a few numbers.

109
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:37,438
Might make a cute musical. It Happened
in the Bullpen: Story of a Woman.

110
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,144
Are you trying to be funny?
Because I'm all out of laughs.

111
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:42,556
I'm over a barrel.
I need a job.

112
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:46,484
- I haven't got a thing.
- Anything. Additional dialogue.

113
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,085
There's nothing. Honest.

114
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,372
Look, Mr. Sheldrake.

115
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:56,154
Could you let me have 300 bucks
yourself, as a personal loan?

116
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:59,035
Could I? Gillis.

117
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,766
Last year somebody talked me
into buying a ranch in the Valley.

118
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:06,389
So I borrowed the money from the
bank in order to pay for the ranch.

119
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,361
This year I mortgaged the ranch so
I could keep up my life insurance...

120
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,191
so I could borrow on my insurance--

121
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:17,657
After that
I drove down to headquarters.

122
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:20,755
That's the way a lot of us
think about Schwab's drugstore.

123
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:24,621
Kind of a combination office,
kaffee klatch and waiting room.

124
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:26,485
Waiting.

125
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:28,341
Waiting for the gravy train.

126
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:35,027
I got myself ten nickels and started
sending out a general SOS.

127
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,844
Couldn't get hold of my agent,
naturally.

128
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:41,325
So then I called a pal of mine,
Artie Green...

129
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:44,081
an awful nice guy,
an assistant director.

130
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,124
He could let me have 20.

131
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,685
But 20 wouldn't do.

132
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,473
Then I talked to
a couple of yes-men at Metro.

133
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,060
To me they said no.

134
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:57,841
Finally I located that agent
of mine. The big faker.

135
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,457
Was he out digging up a job
for poor Joe Gillis?

136
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:05,800
No. He was hard at work in Bel-Air,
making with the golf sticks.

137
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:13,133
So you need $300.
Of course I could give you $300.

138
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,567
- Only I'm not going to.
- No?

139
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:19,527
Get this. I'm not just your agent.
It's not the ten percent.

140
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,607
- I'm your friend.
- You are?

141
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,996
Don't you know the finest things
were written on an empty stomach?

142
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:28,780
Once a talent gets in that Mocambo-
Romanoff rut, you're through.

143
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:31,116
Forget Romanoff's.
It's the car I'm talkin' about!

144
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:33,125
If I lose my car, it's like
having my legs cut off.

145
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,693
Greatest thing
that could happen to you.

146
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:37,766
Now you'll have to sit behind the
typewriter. You'll have to write.

147
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:41,831
What do you think I've been doin'?
I need $300.

148
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:45,795
Sweetheart, maybe what you need
is another agent.

149
00:09:56,976 --> 00:10:00,805
As I drove back towards town,
I took inventory of my prospects.

150
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,400
They now added up to exactly zero.

151
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:06,733
Apparently I just didn't have
what it takes...

152
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,661
and the time had come to wrap up the
whole Hollywood deal and go home.

153
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:15,077
Maybe if I hocked all my junk I'd
have enough for a bus back to Ohio.

154
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:20,136
Back to that $35-a-weekjob writing
copy at the Dayton Evening Post...

155
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:21,798
if it was still open.

156
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,065
Back to the smirking delight
of the whole office.

157
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:28,929
All right, wise guys. Why don't you
go and take a crack at Hollywood?

158
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:30,826
Maybe you think
that you could make--

159
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,211
Uh-oh.

160
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:30,494
I had landed myself in the driveway
of some big mansion...

161
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,057
that looked run-down and deserted.

162
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:36,343
At the end of the drive
was a lovely sight indeed--

163
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:41,273
a great big empty garage
just standing there going to waste.

164
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:45,501
A perfect place to stash a limping
car with a hot license number.

165
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,597
There was another occupant
in that garage--

166
00:11:57,663 --> 00:12:00,630
an enormous,
foreign-built automobile.

167
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:04,149
It must have burned up
ten gallons to a mile.

168
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,091
It had a 1 932 license.

169
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:10,198
I figured that's when the owners
had moved out.

170
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:13,332
And I also figured that I couldn't
go back to my apartment...

171
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:16,121
now that those bloodhounds
were onto me.

172
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:18,392
The idea was to get to Artie Green 's
and stay there...

173
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,077
until I could make that bus
for Ohio.

174
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:24,529
Once back in Dayton, I'd drop the
credit boys a picture postcard...

175
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:27,504
telling them where to pick up
the jalopy.

176
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,464
It was a great big white elephant
of a place...

177
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,271
the kind crazy movie people built
in the crazy '20s.

178
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:40,500
A neglected house
gets an unhappy look.

179
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:43,317
This one had it in spades.

180
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:46,733
It was like that old woman
in Great Expectations--

181
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:51,117
that Miss Havisham in her rotting
wedding dress and her torn veil...

182
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:55,762
taking it out on the world
because she'd been given the go-by.

183
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:03,919
You there!
Why are you so late?

184
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:07,507
Why have you kept me waiting
so long?

185
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,673
In here.

186
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,688
I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blowout. I thought maybe--

187
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:32,298
- Go on in.
- Maybe I better take my car and--

188
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,223
Wipe your feet.

189
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:38,542
Go on.

190
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,274
You're not properly dressed
for the occasion.

191
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,132
- What's the occasion?
- Have him come up, Max.

192
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:53,447
- Up the stairs.
- Suppose you listen for a minute.

193
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,491
Madame is waiting.

194
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:56,939
For me?

195
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,659
Okay.

196
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:09,506
If you need any help
with the coffin, call me.

197
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,764
This way.

198
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,533
In here.

199
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:40,923
I put him on my massage table
in front of the fire.

200
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:44,194
He always liked fires
and poking at them with a stick.

201
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:53,920
I've decided we'll bury him in the
garden. Any city laws against that?

202
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:57,243
- I wouldn't know.
- I don't care anyway.

203
00:14:57,315 --> 00:15:01,505
I want a white coffin, and I want it
specially lined with satin.

204
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:03,774
White or deep pink.

205
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,293
Maybe red. Bright, flaming red.
Let's make it gay.

206
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,595
How much will it be?

207
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:24,380
I warn you, don't give me a fancy
price just because I'm rich!

208
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,681
Lady, you got the wrong man. I had
some trouble with my car. Flat tire.

209
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,947
I pulled into your garage
until I could get a spare.

210
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:35,803
I thought this was an empty house.

211
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,422
It is not. Get out.

212
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:42,484
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry
you lost your friend.

213
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:45,972
And I don't think red
is the right color.

214
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,913
Wait a minute. Haven't I seen you
before? I know your face.

215
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:50,963
Get out.
Or shall I call my servant?

216
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,075
You're Norma Desmond!

217
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:55,089
You used to be in silent pictures.
You used to be big!

218
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:59,094
I am big.

219
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:01,682
It's the pictures that got small.

220
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:03,576
Uh-huh.

221
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,528
I knew there was
something wrong with them.

222
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,862
They're dead. They're finished.

223
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:11,857
There was a time when this business
had the eyes of the whole world.

224
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:14,317
But that wasn't good enough
for them. Oh, no!

225
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,432
They had to have the ears
of the world too.

226
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:21,107
So they opened their big mouths
and out came talk, talk, talk.

227
00:16:21,175 --> 00:16:23,476
That's where the popcorn business
comes in.

228
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:25,430
You buy yourself a bag
and plug up your ears.

229
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:29,072
Look at them in the front offices,
the masterminds!

230
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:31,247
They took the idols
and smashed them.

231
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:34,001
The Fairbankses, the Gilberts,
the Valentinos!

232
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:36,851
And who have we got now?
Some nobodies!

233
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,600
Don't blame me.
I'm not an executive, just a writer.

234
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:43,756
You are. Writing words,
words, more words!

235
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:46,642
Well, you've made a rope of words
and strangled this business!

236
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:49,195
But there's a microphone right there
to catch the last gurgles...

237
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:52,135
and Technicolor to photograph
the red, swollen tongue!

238
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,315
Shh. You'll wake up the monkey.

239
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:57,069
Get out! Max!

240
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:59,855
Next time I'll bring
my autograph album along.

241
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:02,287
Or maybe a hunk of cement,
and ask for your footprint.

242
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:10,280
- It's okay. Okay, I'm going.
-Just a minute, you.

243
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:13,440
- You're a writer, you said.
- Why?

244
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:14,825
Are you or aren't you?

245
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:17,478
That's what it says
on my Guild card.

246
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:21,125
And you have written pictures,
haven't you?

247
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:24,064
Sure have.
Want a list of my credits?

248
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:26,887
I want to ask you something.
Come in here.

249
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:29,671
Last one I wrote was about Okies
in the Dust Bowl.

250
00:17:29,738 --> 00:17:31,777
You'd never know it, because
when it reached the screen...

251
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,816
the whole thing
played on a torpedo boat.

252
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,261
Intimate, isn't it?

253
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:50,691
The wind gets in that blasted pipe
organ. I ought to have it taken out.

254
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:53,026
Or teach it a better tune.

255
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:55,264
Young man, tell me something.

256
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:59,108
How long is a movie script
these days? I mean how many pages?

257
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:01,311
Depends on what it is,
a Donald Duck or a Joan of Arc.

258
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,519
This is to be
a very important picture.

259
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:05,824
I've written it myself.
Took me years.

260
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,021
Looks like enough
for six important pictures.

261
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:11,808
It's a story of Salome.
I think I'll have DeMille direct it.

262
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:14,743
DeMille? Uh-huh.

263
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:18,014
- We made many pictures together.
- And you'll play Salome.

264
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:21,531
Who else?

265
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,903
Only asking. I didn't know
you were planning a comeback.

266
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,035
I hate that word! It's a return!

267
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:31,414
A return to the millions who have never
forgiven me for deserting the screen.

268
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:34,008
- Fair enough.
- Salome.

269
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,949
What a woman. What a part!

270
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:39,194
The princess
in love with a holy man.

271
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:41,433
She dances
the dance of the seven veils.

272
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:44,698
He rejects her, so she demands
his head on a golden tray...

273
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:48,442
kissing his cold, dead lips.

274
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,936
They'll love it in Pomona.

275
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,663
They'll love it every place.

276
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,253
Read it. Read the scene just before
she has him killed.

277
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:57,560
Never let another writer read
your material. He may steal it.

278
00:18:57,628 --> 00:19:01,370
I'm not afraid. Read it.
Max, bring something to drink.

279
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:04,727
Sit down.
Is there enough light?

280
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:07,282
I've got 20-20 vision.

281
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,361
I said sit down.

282
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:15,726
Well, I had
no pressing engagement...

283
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:18,648
except with those boys
from the finance office...

284
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:21,079
and she'd mentioned
something to drink.

285
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:23,216
Why not?

286
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:27,598
Sometimes it's interesting to see
just how bad, bad writing can be.

287
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:31,478
This promised to go the limit.

288
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:36,277
I wondered what a handwriting expert
would make of her childish scrawl.

289
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:41,868
Max wheeled in some champagne
and some caviar.

290
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:47,124
Later I found out that Max was the only
other person in that grim Sunset castle.

291
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:49,807
And I found out
a few other things about him.

292
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:54,608
As for her, she sat
coiled up like a watch spring...

293
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:57,359
her cigarette clamped
in a curious holder.

294
00:19:57,427 --> 00:20:00,655
I could sense her eyes on me
from behind those dark glasses...

295
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:03,657
defying me not to like
what I read.

296
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,886
Or maybe begging me
in her own proud way to like it.

297
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,742
It meant so much to her.

298
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:18,605
It sure was a cozy setup--

299
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:21,672
that bundle of raw nerves and Max...

300
00:20:21,744 --> 00:20:23,816
and a dead monkey upstairs...

301
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:26,952
and the wind wheezing through
that organ once in a while.

302
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:38,027
Later on, just for comedy relief...

303
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:40,809
the real guy arrived
with the baby coffin.

304
00:20:41,932 --> 00:20:45,314
It was all done with great dignity.

305
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:48,322
He must have been
a very important chimp.

306
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:52,104
The great-grandson
of King Kong maybe.

307
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,649
It got to be 11:00.

308
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,529
I was feeling
a little sick at my stomach...

309
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:03,456
what with that sweet champagne
and that tripe I'd been reading--

310
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,620
that silly hodgepodge
of melodramatic plots.

311
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:09,793
However, by then...

312
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:13,125
I'd started concocting
a little plot of my own.

313
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,654
Well?

314
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:18,626
This is fascinating.

315
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,549
Of course it is.

316
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:24,257
Maybe it's a little long and maybe
there's some repetitions...

317
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:27,173
but you're
not a professional writer.

318
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:29,375
I wrote that with my heart.

319
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:31,300
Sure you did.

320
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,211
That's what makes it great.

321
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:39,490
What it needs is maybe
a little more dialogue.

322
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:42,238
What for? I can say
anything I want with my eyes.

323
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:44,696
Well, it certainly could use
a pair of shears and a blue pencil.

324
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,159
I will not have it butchered.

325
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:50,779
Of course not,
but it ought to be organized.

326
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,119
Just an editing job.
You can find somebody.

327
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,982
Who? I'd have to have
somebody I could trust.

328
00:21:57,057 --> 00:21:59,707
When were you born?
I mean what sign of the zodiac?

329
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,940
- I don't know.
- What month?

330
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,917
December 21.

331
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:08,439
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians.
You can trust them.

332
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,246
- Thank you.
- I want you to do this work.

333
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,358
Me?

334
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,292
I'm busy. I just finished a script,
and I'm doing another assignment.

335
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,023
I don't care.

336
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:24,533
You know, I'm pretty expensive.
I get 500 a week.

337
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:28,275
I wouldn't worry about money.
I'll make it worth your while.

338
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:31,601
Maybe I'd better take the rest
of the script home and read it.

339
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:35,352
I couldn't let it out of my house.
You'll have to finish it here.

340
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,590
Well, it's getting kind of late.

341
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:41,682
- Are you married, Mr.--
- Name is Gillis. Single.

342
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:42,998
Where do you live?

343
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:45,204
Hollywood.
Alto Nido Apartments.

344
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:47,248
There's something wrong
with your car, you said.

345
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:49,176
There sure is.

346
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:52,819
- Why shouldn't you stay here?
- I'll come back early tomorrow.

347
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:56,336
Nonsense.
There's a room over the garage.

348
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,230
Max will take you there.

349
00:22:58,296 --> 00:22:59,670
Max!

350
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:07,442
I felt kind of pleased with the way
I'd handled the situation.

351
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,805
I dropped the hook,
and she snapped at it.

352
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,961
My car would be safe below while
I did a patch-up job on the script.

353
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:18,445
And there should be
plenty of money in it.

354
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:26,061
This room hasn't been used
for a long time.

355
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:29,873
It'll never make House Beautiful,
but I guess it's okay for one night.

356
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:31,727
I made your bed this afternoon.

357
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:36,017
Thanks. How did you know I was
gonna stay this afternoon?

358
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:40,205
The bathroom's over there. I put in
some towels, soap and a toothbrush.

359
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,396
Say, she's quite a character,
that Norma Desmond.

360
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:52,042
She was the greatest of them all.
You wouldn't know. You're too young.

361
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:55,886
In one week she received
17,000 fan letters.

362
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:59,399
Men bribed her hairdresser
to get a lock of her hair.

363
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,772
There was a maharaja
who came all the way from India...

364
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:04,391
to beg one of her silk stockings.

365
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:06,828
Later he strangled himself
with it.

366
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:11,017
Well, I sure turned in
to an interesting driveway.

367
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:12,459
You did, sir.

368
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,339
Good night, sir.

369
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:22,698
I pegged him
as slightly cuckoo too.

370
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,249
A stroke, maybe.

371
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,670
Come to think of it, the whole
place seemed to be stricken...

372
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:32,455
with a kind of creeping paralysis...

373
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:34,823
out of beat with
the rest of the world...

374
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:37,507
crumbling apart in slow motion.

375
00:24:38,537 --> 00:24:43,238
There was a tennis court-- or rather
the ghost of a tennis court...

376
00:24:43,304 --> 00:24:45,889
with faded markings
and a sagging net.

377
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:53,185
And of course she had a pool.

378
00:24:53,254 --> 00:24:54,847
Who didn't then?

379
00:24:54,918 --> 00:25:00,449
Mabel Normand and John Gilbert must
have swum in it 10,000 midnights ago.

380
00:25:00,518 --> 00:25:02,208
And Vilma Banky and Rod LaRoque.

381
00:25:04,357 --> 00:25:06,659
It was empty now.

382
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:08,219
Or was it?

383
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,066
There was something else
going on below.

384
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:20,855
The last rites
for that hairy old chimp...

385
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,507
performed
with the utmost seriousness...

386
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:27,359
as if she were laying to rest
an only child.

387
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:32,215
Was her life really as empty
as that?

388
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:43,101
It was all very queer.

389
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,515
But queerer things
were yet to come.

390
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:57,113
That night I had a mixed-up dream.

391
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:59,772
In it there was an organ grinder.

392
00:25:59,843 --> 00:26:03,487
I couldn't see his face, but the
organ was all draped in black...

393
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:06,455
and a chimp
was dancing for pennies.

394
00:26:07,553 --> 00:26:10,717
When I opened my eyes,
the music was still there.

395
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:13,951
Where was I?

396
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:20,346
Oh, yes. That empty room
over her garage.

397
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,270
Only it wasn't empty anymore.

398
00:26:23,743 --> 00:26:25,914
I'd had a visitor.

399
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:29,943
Somebody had brought my belongings--
my books, my typewriter, my clothes.

400
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,141
What was going on?

401
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:55,539
Hey, you! Max, whatever-your-name-is,
what are my things doing here?

402
00:26:56,858 --> 00:27:01,080
I'm talkin' to you! My clothes
and things are up in the room!

403
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:04,211
Naturally.
I brought them myself.

404
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:07,061
Is that so?

405
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,878
Why, what's the matter?
Is there anything missing?

406
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:11,798
Who said you could?
Who asked you to?

407
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:15,758
I did. I don't know why
you should be so upset.

408
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:17,587
Stop that playing, Max.

409
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:20,949
It seemed like a good idea
if we are to work together.

410
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,438
Look, I'm supposed to fix up
your script.

411
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:27,763
- There's no deal about my staying!
- You'll like it here.

412
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:29,869
Thanks for the invitation.
I've got my own apartment.

413
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:32,275
You can't work in an apartment
where you owe three months' rent.

414
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:36,137
- I'll take care of that.
- It's all taken care of, paid for.

415
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,687
Okay, we'll deduct it
from my salary.

416
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:44,977
Now, now, don't let's be small about
such matters. We won't keep books.

417
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:48,042
Max, unpack Mr. Gillis's things.

418
00:27:48,115 --> 00:27:50,024
It is done, Madame.

419
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:52,464
Well, pack them up again!
I didn't say I was staying!

420
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:56,588
Suppose you make up your mind.
Do you want this job or don't you?

421
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:01,289
Yes, I wanted the job.

422
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,069
I wanted the dough, and I wanted
to get out of there as quickly as I could.

423
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:09,421
I thought if I really got going I could
finish it up in a couple of weeks.

424
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,526
But it wasn't so simple
getting some coherence...

425
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,501
into those
wild hallucinations of hers.

426
00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:18,316
And what made it even tougher was
that she was around all the time...

427
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:23,618
hovering over me, afraid I'd do
injury to her precious brainchild.

428
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,220
- What's that?
- Just a scene I threw out.

429
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,851
Which scene?

430
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:38,087
The one where you go to the slave
market. It's better to cut to John--

431
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:40,489
Cut away from me?

432
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:43,173
Honestly, it's too much of you.
They don't want you in every scene.

433
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:46,372
They don't? Then why do they still
write me fan letters every day?

434
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,903
Why do they beg me
for my photographs?

435
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:51,938
Why? Because they want to see me.
Me! Norma Desmond.

436
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:54,343
Put it back.

437
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:56,742
Okay.

438
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,520
I didn't argue with her.

439
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,299
You don't yell at a sleepwalker.
He may fall and break his neck.

440
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:17,534
That's it.

441
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:21,401
She was still sleepwalking along
the giddy heights of a lost career.

442
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:26,264
Plain crazy when it came to that
one subject, her celluloid self...

443
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,641
the great Norma Desmond.

444
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:33,213
How could she breathe in that house
so crowded with Norma Desmonds?

445
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:35,137
More Norma Desmonds.

446
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:38,081
And still more Norma Desmonds.

447
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:43,004
It wasn't all work, of course.

448
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,618
Two or three times a week, Max would
haul up that enormous painting...

449
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:49,786
that had been presented to her by
some Nevada chamber of commerce...

450
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:53,406
and we'd see a movie,
right in her living room.

451
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:56,918
So much nicer than going out,
she'd say.

452
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,943
The plain fact was she was afraid
of that world outside.

453
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:05,047
Afraid it would remind her
that time had passed.

454
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:11,483
They were silent movies, and Max
would run the projection machine--

455
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:13,653
which was just as well.

456
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:17,335
It kept him from giving us an
accompaniment on that wheezing organ.

457
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:21,810
She'd sit very close to me...

458
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:25,014
and she smelled of tuberoses,
which is not my favorite perfume...

459
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:27,253
not by a long shot.

460
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:31,512
Sometimes as we watched,
she'd clutch my arm or my hand...

461
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:33,650
forgetting she was my employer.

462
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:38,576
Just becoming a fan, excited about
that actress up there on the screen.

463
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:42,637
I guess I don 't have to tell you
who the star was.

464
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:46,448
They were always her pictures.

465
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,202
That's all she wanted to see.

466
00:31:13,427 --> 00:31:15,728
Still wonderful, isn't it?

467
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:18,348
And no dialogue.

468
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,288
We didn't need dialogue.
We had faces.

469
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,613
There just aren't any faces
like that anymore.

470
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,885
Maybe one, Garbo.

471
00:31:29,393 --> 00:31:31,432
Oh, those idiot producers.

472
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:33,293
Those imbeciles.

473
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,327
Haven't they got any eyes? Have they
forgotten what a star looks like?

474
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,018
I'll show them.
I'll be up there again, so help me!

475
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:52,698
Sometimes there'd be
a little bridge game in the house...

476
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:54,972
at a twentieth of a cent a point.

477
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,949
I'd get half of her winnings.

478
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:59,358
Once they ran up to 70 cents...

479
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:02,652
which was about the only cash money
I ever got.

480
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:05,588
The others around the table
would be actor friends--

481
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:09,339
dim figures you may still remember
from the silent days.

482
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:12,057
I used to think of them
as her waxworks.

483
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:13,369
One diamond.

484
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:15,412
One heart.

485
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:18,555
Spade.

486
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,889
Pass.

487
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:23,192
- Three no-trump.
- Pass.

488
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:25,140
Pass.

489
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:27,546
Empty the ashtray, will you,
Joe, dear?

490
00:32:55,063 --> 00:32:57,397
- Some men outside asked for you.
- I'm not here.

491
00:32:57,462 --> 00:32:59,567
- That's what I told them.
- Good.

492
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:02,769
But they found your car
and they're going to tow it away.

493
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:07,668
Where's the ashtray?
Joe, can't we have the ashtray?

494
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:16,043
I want to talk to you for a minute.

495
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:18,385
Not now, my dear.
I'm playing three no-trump.

496
00:33:18,452 --> 00:33:20,110
They've come for my car.

497
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,343
Please. Now I've forgotten
how many spades are out.

498
00:33:23,411 --> 00:33:26,826
- Look, I need some money right now.
- Can't you wait until I'm dummy?

499
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:28,360
No.

500
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:29,644
Please.

501
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:05,218
Now what is it?
Where's the fire?

502
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,918
- I've lost my car.
- Oh!

503
00:34:06,988 --> 00:34:08,963
And I thought it was
a matter of life and death.

504
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:11,851
It is, to me.
That's why I came to this house.

505
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,021
That's why I took this job
ghostwriting.

506
00:34:14,092 --> 00:34:17,703
Now you're being silly. We don't
need two cars. We have a car.

507
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:21,000
Not one of those cheap new things
made of chromium and spit.

508
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:24,993
An Isotta-Fraschini. Have you
ever heard of Isotta-Fraschini?

509
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:29,255
All handmade. Cost me $28,000.

510
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:35,013
So Max got that old bus down
off its blocks and polished it up.

511
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,237
She'd take me for rides
in the hills above Sunset.

512
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:43,325
The whole thing was upholstered
in leopard skin...

513
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,173
and had one of those car phones,
all gold-plated.

514
00:34:49,446 --> 00:34:52,610
- That's a dreadful shirt.
- What's wrong with it?

515
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:54,401
Nothing, if you work
in the filling station.

516
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:58,330
And I'm getting rather bored with
that sport jacket and same baggy pants.

517
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:05,118
Max, what's a good men's shop?
The very best? Well, go there.

518
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:08,253
I don't need clothes, and I don't
want you buying them for me.

519
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:11,356
Why begrudge me a little fun?
I just want you to look nice.

520
00:35:12,962 --> 00:35:14,817
And must you chew gum?

521
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:24,413
Ah, there's nothing like
blue flannel for a man.

522
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,455
This one, single-breasted,
of course.

523
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:29,081
Now we need a topcoat. Let me see
what you have in camel's hair.

524
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,825
- How about some evening clothes?
- I don't need a tuxedo.

525
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:37,597
You do. A tuxedo and tails, and
if you aren't careful, a cutaway.

526
00:35:37,662 --> 00:35:39,189
Tails! That's ridiculous.

527
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:41,335
You need them for parties.
You need them for New Year's Eve.

528
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,642
- Where are your evening clothes?
- This way, Madame.

529
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:50,646
Here are some camel's hair,
but I'd like you just to feel this.

530
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:53,105
It's vicuna. Of course,
it's a little more expensive.

531
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,351
The camel's hair will do.

532
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,921
Well, as long as the lady's paying
for it, why not take the vicuna?

533
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,577
The last week in December,
the rains came.

534
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:17,070
A great big package of rain--

535
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:20,406
oversized, like everything else
in California.

536
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,753
It came right through the old roof
of my room above the garage.

537
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,613
She had Max move me
to the main house.

538
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:32,075
I didn't much like the idea.

539
00:36:32,151 --> 00:36:36,176
The only time I could have
to myself was in that room.

540
00:36:36,246 --> 00:36:39,344
But it was better than sleeping
in a raincoat and galoshes.

541
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:16,936
Whose room was this?

542
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:19,397
It was the room of the husband.

543
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,511
Of the husbands, I should say.

544
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,819
Madame has been married
three times.

545
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:31,789
I guess that's the one
you can see Catalina from.

546
00:37:31,854 --> 00:37:33,708
Only this isn't the day.

547
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,065
Say, what's this with the door?
There isn't any lock.

548
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:53,794
There are no locks anywhere
in this house, sir.

549
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:00,997
How come?

550
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:02,658
There must be a reason.

551
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:05,379
- The doctor suggested it.
- What doctor?

552
00:38:05,448 --> 00:38:07,074
Madame's doctor.

553
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:10,526
Madame has moments of melancholy.

554
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,771
There have been
some attempts at suicide.

555
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:18,107
We have to be very careful.
No sleeping pills, no razor blades.

556
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:20,637
We shut off the gas
in Madame's bedroom.

557
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:23,716
Why? Her career?

558
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:25,636
She got enough out of it.
She's not forgotten.

559
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:27,490
She still gets those fan letters.

560
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:30,556
I wouldn't look too closely
at the postmarks.

561
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:36,643
You send them.
Is that it, Max?

562
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:39,424
I'd better press
your evening clothes, sir.

563
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:42,807
Mr. Gillis has not forgotten
Madame's New Year's party?

564
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:45,946
No, no, I haven't.

565
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:48,222
I suppose all the waxworks
are coming.

566
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,966
I wouldn't know, sir.
Madame made the arrangements.

567
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:12,439
There it was again.

568
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,764
That room of hers,
all satin and ruffles.

569
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,546
And that bed,
like a gilded rowboat.

570
00:39:19,613 --> 00:39:22,363
The perfect setting
for a silent movie queen.

571
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:25,397
Poor devil.

572
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:29,778
Still waving proudly to a parade
which had long since passed her by.

573
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:37,187
It was at her New Year's party that
I found out how she felt about me.

574
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:41,957
Maybe I'd been an idiot
not to have sensed it was coming--

575
00:39:42,023 --> 00:39:44,444
that sad, embarrassing revelation.

576
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:51,172
Joe!

577
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:59,193
You look absolutely divine.

578
00:39:59,268 --> 00:40:00,674
- T urn around.
- Please.

579
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:04,351
Come on. Perfect.
Wonderful shoulders.

580
00:40:04,419 --> 00:40:06,207
I love that line.

581
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:08,642
It's all padding.
Don't let it fool you.

582
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:12,415
To me, getting dressed up was always
just putting on my dark blue suit.

583
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:14,391
I don't like the stud they sent.
I want you to have a pearl.

584
00:40:14,465 --> 00:40:16,058
A big luscious pearl.

585
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:18,234
Well, I'm not going to wear
earrings, I can tell you that.

586
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,462
Cute.
Let's have a drink.

587
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:24,285
- Shouldn't we wait for the others?
- Max, champagne.

588
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,319
Careful, it's slippery.
I had it waxed.

589
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:31,902
Here's to us.

590
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:35,733
This floor used to be wood,
but I had it changed.

591
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:39,450
Valentino said there's
nothing like tile for a tango.

592
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:41,557
Come on.

593
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,385
Not on the same floor
with Valentino.

594
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:44,828
Just follow me.

595
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:04,729
Don't bend back like that.

596
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:06,703
It's that thing.
It tickles.

597
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:08,152
It does?

598
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:35,028
It's quarter past 10:00. What time
are they supposed to get here?

599
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,686
- Who?
- The other guests.

600
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:40,880
There are no guests. We don't want
to share this night with others.

601
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:43,086
This is for you and me.

602
00:41:43,156 --> 00:41:46,222
- Oh?
- Hold me tighter.

603
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,666
Okay.

604
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:51,629
Come midnight, how about
blindfolding the orchestra...

605
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:54,382
and smashing champagne glasses
over Max's head?

606
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,784
You think this is
all very funny.

607
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,930
A little.

608
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,056
An hour dragged by.

609
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:11,591
I felt caught, like the cigarette
in that contraption on her finger.

610
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,992
What a wonderful next year it's
going to be. What fun we'll have!

611
00:42:22,063 --> 00:42:23,589
I'll fill the pool for you.

612
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:26,793
I'll open my house in Malibu,
and you can have the whole ocean.

613
00:42:26,862 --> 00:42:29,676
When our picture is finished,
I'll buy you a boat...

614
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:31,781
and we'll sail to Hawaii--

615
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:33,707
Stop it. You're not
gonna buy me anything more.

616
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:35,561
Don't be silly.

617
00:42:35,628 --> 00:42:39,010
Here. I was going to
give it to you at midnight.

618
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:43,171
Norma, I can't take it.
You've bought me enough.

619
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:44,966
Shut up. I'm rich.

620
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:48,133
I'm richer than all this
new Hollywood trash.

621
00:42:48,202 --> 00:42:50,373
- I've got a million dollars.
- Keep it.

622
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,565
I own three blocks downtown.
I've got oil in Bakersfield.

623
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:57,633
Pumping, pumping, pumping.

624
00:42:57,705 --> 00:43:00,225
What's it for but to buy us
anything we want?

625
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:01,758
Cut out that "us" business!

626
00:43:02,984 --> 00:43:04,478
What's the matter with you?

627
00:43:04,552 --> 00:43:06,974
What right do you have
to take me for granted?

628
00:43:08,071 --> 00:43:10,886
What right?
Do you want me to tell you?

629
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,173
Has it ever occurred to you
that I may have a life of my own?

630
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:18,140
That there may be some girl
that I'm crazy about?

631
00:43:18,214 --> 00:43:22,468
Who? Some carhop or dress extra?

632
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:25,086
What I'm trying to say
is that I'm all wrong for you.

633
00:43:25,157 --> 00:43:28,899
You want a Valentino, somebody
with polo ponies. A big shot.

634
00:43:28,964 --> 00:43:32,160
What you're trying to say is
you don't want me to love you.

635
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:33,755
Say it.

636
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:34,875
Say it!

637
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:50,256
I didn't know where I was going.

638
00:44:50,328 --> 00:44:52,695
I just had to get out of there.

639
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,247
I had to be with people
my own age.

640
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,228
I had to hear somebody laugh again.

641
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:01,803
I thought of Artie Green.

642
00:45:01,878 --> 00:45:03,918
There was bound to be
a New Year's shindig going on...

643
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,226
in his apartment
down on Las Palmas.

644
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:10,068
Writers without a job,
composers without a publisher...

645
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:14,355
actresses so young they still believe
the guys in the casting offices.

646
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,973
A bunch of kids
who didn't give a hoot...

647
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:19,564
just so long
as they had a yuk to share.

648
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:23,533
Hollywood for us
ain't been so good

649
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:26,221
Got no swimming pool
Very few clothes

650
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:30,796
All we earn are buttons and bows

651
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:36,105
- Hello, Joe.
- How are you, Joe?

652
00:45:36,177 --> 00:45:38,031
- Welcome to the party.
- Hi, Joe.

653
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:42,479
- What do you know! Joe Gillis!
- Hi, Artie.

654
00:45:42,544 --> 00:45:44,486
Where you been keeping
that gorgeous face of yours?

655
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,658
- In a deep freeze.
- I almost reported you as missing.

656
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:50,761
Fans, you all know Joe Gillis,
the well-known screenwriter...

657
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,219
uranium smuggler
and Black Dahlia suspect.

658
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:57,291
- Come on, gimme your coat.
- Let it ride for a while.

659
00:45:57,358 --> 00:45:59,813
- You're gonna stay, aren't you?
- That was the general idea.

660
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:02,122
Well, come on.

661
00:46:02,189 --> 00:46:03,977
What is this, mink?

662
00:46:05,164 --> 00:46:07,652
Judas H. Priest!

663
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:10,113
Who did you borrow that from?
Adolphe Menjou?

664
00:46:10,188 --> 00:46:11,562
Close, but no cigar.

665
00:46:11,627 --> 00:46:13,536
You're not really a smuggler,
are you?

666
00:46:13,611 --> 00:46:16,099
- Where's the bar?
- Come on.

667
00:46:18,731 --> 00:46:20,421
- It's a good party.
- The greatest.

668
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,239
They call me the Elsa Maxwell
of the assistant directors.

669
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:26,022
Hey, wait a minute.
Go easy on that punch bowl.

670
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:29,285
Budget only calls for three drinks
per extra. Fake the rest.

671
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,393
Say, Artie, can I
stick around here for a while?

672
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:33,058
Sure.
This will go on all night.

673
00:46:33,129 --> 00:46:35,136
No, I mean can you put me up
for a couple of weeks?

674
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:37,281
It just so happens
we have a vacancy on the couch.

675
00:46:37,352 --> 00:46:39,620
- I'll take it.
- The bellhop can take your luggage.

676
00:46:39,687 --> 00:46:42,534
Just register it here.

677
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:46,684
- Hello, Mr. Gillis.
- Hello.

678
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:48,547
- You know each other?
- Let me help you.

679
00:46:48,614 --> 00:46:50,653
Betty Schaefer, Sheldrake's office.

680
00:46:50,726 --> 00:46:52,482
Oh, sure. Bases Loaded.

681
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:56,193
Wait. This is the woman I love.
What's going on? Who was loaded?

682
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:58,628
Don't worry. She's just a fan
for my literary output.

683
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:01,376
- Hurt feelings department.
- Where's the phone?

684
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,298
Over by the rainbow room.

685
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:15,356
Say, when you're through with
that thing, can I have it?

686
00:47:19,393 --> 00:47:21,281
Hey, you forgot this.

687
00:47:21,345 --> 00:47:24,890
- Thanks.
- I've been hoping to run into you.

688
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:27,611
What for? To recover that knife
you stuck in my back?

689
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,495
No, I felt a little guilty, so
I got out some of your old stories.

690
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,989
Why, you sweet kid.

691
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:35,030
There's one called Window,
something with a window.

692
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:37,012
- Dark Windows. How'd you like it?
- I didn't.

693
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,574
- Thank you.
- Except for about six pages.

694
00:47:39,646 --> 00:47:42,548
You've got a flashback there--

695
00:47:42,622 --> 00:47:45,077
Is there someplace we can talk?

696
00:47:45,149 --> 00:47:47,004
How about the rainbow room?

697
00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:52,535
Hey. I said you could have my couch.
I didn't say you could have my girl.

698
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:54,617
Oh, this is shop talk.

699
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:57,747
Now, if I got you correctly, there
was a short stretch of my fiction...

700
00:47:57,816 --> 00:47:59,758
which you found worthy of notice.

701
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:02,799
The flashback scene in the courtroom
when she tells about being a teacher.

702
00:48:02,872 --> 00:48:04,660
I had a teacher like that once.

703
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:07,793
Maybe that's why it's good.
It's true. It's moving.

704
00:48:07,863 --> 00:48:10,284
- Why don't you use that character--
- Who wants true? Who wants moving?

705
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:13,173
Drop that attitude!
Here's something really worthwhile.

706
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:15,093
Want me to start right away?
Maybe there's some paper around.

707
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:18,289
- I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
- I've got a few ideas of my own.

708
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:21,073
One being this is New Year's Eve.
How about living it up a little?

709
00:48:21,141 --> 00:48:22,864
- As for instance?
- Well--

710
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,388
We could make some paper boats
and have a regatta.

711
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,151
Or we could turn on the shower
full blast.

712
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,609
How about capturing the kitchen
and barricading the door?

713
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:32,269
- Are you hungry?
- Hungry?

714
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:36,429
After 12 years in the Burmese
jungle, I'm starving, Lady Agatha.

715
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:38,734
Starving for a white shoulder--

716
00:48:38,803 --> 00:48:40,363
Phillip, you're mad!

717
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:42,822
Thirsting for the coolness
of your lips.

718
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:47,018
You can have the phone now.

719
00:48:48,464 --> 00:48:50,569
No, Phillip, no.
We must be strong.

720
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,941
You're still wearing the uniform
of the Cold stream Guards.

721
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:56,106
Furthermore,
you can have the phone now.

722
00:48:56,176 --> 00:48:58,150
Okay.

723
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:00,710
Suddenly I find myself
terribly afraid of losing you.

724
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:04,230
You won't. I'll get us a refill
of this horrible liquid.

725
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:08,328
- You'll be waiting for me?
- With a wildly beating heart.

726
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:11,245
Life can be beautiful.

727
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:32,805
Hello, Max. This is Mr. Gillis.
I want you to do me a favor.

728
00:49:32,874 --> 00:49:36,135
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis.
I cannot talk now.

729
00:49:36,201 --> 00:49:41,056
Yes, you can. Get my old suitcase
and put in all my old clothes.

730
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:43,168
And my typewriter.
I'll have somebody pick them up.

731
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,266
I have no time to do anything now.
The doctor is here.

732
00:49:48,327 --> 00:49:50,236
What doctor?
What's going on?

733
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:54,621
Madame got the razor from your room,
and she cut her wrists.

734
00:49:54,694 --> 00:49:56,069
What?

735
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,839
I just got the recipe. You take
two packages of cough drops...

736
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,625
and dissolve in one gallon
of lukewarm grape juice--

737
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:23,393
Hey, Joe!

738
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:32,127
Happy New Year!

739
00:50:37,248 --> 00:50:39,103
- How is she?
- She's up in her room.

740
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:42,679
Be careful. Don't race upstairs.

741
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,922
The musicians mustn't know
what happened.

742
00:51:27,481 --> 00:51:28,855
Go away.

743
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:41,014
What kind of a silly thing
was that to do?

744
00:51:41,078 --> 00:51:43,980
To fall in love with you,
that was the idiotic thing.

745
00:51:46,294 --> 00:51:49,075
It sure would have made
attractive headlines.

746
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:51,508
"Great Star Kills Herself
for Unknown Writer."

747
00:51:52,245 --> 00:51:55,473
Great stars have great pride.

748
00:52:00,883 --> 00:52:02,890
Go away.

749
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:05,167
Go to that girl of yours.

750
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:11,819
Look, I was making that up...

751
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:14,159
because I thought the whole thing
was a mistake.

752
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:19,847
I didn't want to hurt you.
You've been good to me.

753
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:23,401
You're the only person in this
stinking town that has been good to me.

754
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:26,952
Why don't you just
say thank you and go? Go, go!

755
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:30,220
Not until you promise to act
like a sensible human being.

756
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:34,760
I'll do it again.
I'll do it again.

757
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,764
I'll do it again.

758
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,566
Happy New Year, Norma.

759
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,002
Happy New Year, darling.

760
00:54:00,264 --> 00:54:01,158
Hello?

761
00:54:01,224 --> 00:54:05,118
Is this Crestview 5-1733?

762
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:07,427
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but I've confirmed the number.

763
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:09,469
I must speak to Mr. Gillis.

764
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:11,036
He's not here.

765
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:14,557
Where can I reach him?
Maybe somebody else could tell me--

766
00:54:14,629 --> 00:54:17,793
Nobody here can give you
any information.

767
00:54:17,862 --> 00:54:20,414
And you will please not call again.

768
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:28,835
Who was it, Max?
What is it?

769
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:32,120
Nothing, Madame.

770
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:35,675
Somebody inquiring
about a stray dog.

771
00:54:35,746 --> 00:54:39,520
Our number must be very similar
to the number of the pound.

772
00:54:40,226 --> 00:54:42,811
Wait a minute.
I want you to get out the car.

773
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:47,037
Take the script to Paramount and
deliver it to Mr. DeMille in person.

774
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:48,152
Very good, Madame.

775
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,574
- You really sending it to DeMille?
- Yes, I am.

776
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:58,014
This is the day.

777
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,184
Here's the chart from my astrologer.
She read my horoscope and DeMille's.

778
00:55:00,254 --> 00:55:01,629
She read the script?

779
00:55:01,695 --> 00:55:05,469
DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio.
Mars has been transiting Jupiter.

780
00:55:05,534 --> 00:55:08,349
Today is the day
of the greatest conjunction.

781
00:55:09,534 --> 00:55:11,868
Turn around, darling.
Let me dry you.

782
00:55:14,685 --> 00:55:18,132
I hope you realize that scripts
don't sell on astrologers' charts.

783
00:55:18,204 --> 00:55:20,473
I'm not just selling the script,
I'm selling me.

784
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,190
DeMille always said
I was his greatest star.

785
00:55:23,259 --> 00:55:25,114
When did he say it, Norma?

786
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:28,145
All right, it was
quite a few years ago.

787
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:31,088
The point is,
I never looked better in my life.

788
00:55:31,163 --> 00:55:34,577
You know why? Because I've
never been as happy in my life.

789
00:55:39,289 --> 00:55:42,485
A few evenings later we were going to
the house of one of the waxworks...

790
00:55:42,552 --> 00:55:44,341
for some bridge.

791
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:46,677
She'd taught me
how to play bridge by then...

792
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:49,907
just as she'd taught me
some fancy tango steps...

793
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:52,790
and what wine to drink
with what fish.

794
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:58,195
That idiot. He forgot
to fill my cigarette case.

795
00:55:58,262 --> 00:56:00,116
Here, have one of mine.

796
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:02,516
They're dreadful.
They make me cough.

797
00:56:05,685 --> 00:56:08,881
Pull up to the drugstore, Max.
I'll get you some.

798
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,803
You're a darling.

799
00:56:31,249 --> 00:56:33,932
Give me a package
of those Turkish cigarettes--

800
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:35,375
Abdullah.

801
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,570
Stick'em up, Gillis.

802
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,225
Stick'em up,
or I'll let you have it.

803
00:56:42,447 --> 00:56:44,301
Hi, Artie.
Evening, Miss Schaefer.

804
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,181
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Walking out on the mob.

805
00:56:47,246 --> 00:56:49,766
- What's the big idea?
- I'm sorry about New Year's.

806
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:52,172
Would you believe me if I told you
I stayed with a sick friend?

807
00:56:52,238 --> 00:56:55,402
Someone in the formal set, no doubt,
with a ten-carat kidney stone.

808
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,641
Oh, stop it, Artie, will you?

809
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:01,320
Where have you been keeping yourself?
I've got wonderful news for you.

810
00:57:01,389 --> 00:57:03,974
I haven't been keeping myself
at all. Not lately.

811
00:57:04,044 --> 00:57:06,597
I called your agent,
I called the Screenwriters Guild.

812
00:57:06,668 --> 00:57:08,936
Finally your old apartment
gave me some Crestview number.

813
00:57:09,004 --> 00:57:11,175
Somebody with an accent
growling at me.

814
00:57:11,243 --> 00:57:14,886
You weren't there. You weren't to be
spoken to. They never heard of you.

815
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:16,612
Is that so?

816
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:19,846
- What's the wonderful news?
- Sheldrake likes the teacher angle.

817
00:57:19,914 --> 00:57:21,321
- What teacher?
- Dark Windows.

818
00:57:21,386 --> 00:57:24,200
I got him all hopped up about it.
He thinks it could be made into something.

819
00:57:24,265 --> 00:57:25,923
Okay, where's the cash?

820
00:57:25,993 --> 00:57:27,367
Where's the story?

821
00:57:27,433 --> 00:57:30,083
I bluffed it out
with a few notions of my own.

822
00:57:30,152 --> 00:57:32,257
- It needs work.
- I was afraid of that.

823
00:57:32,328 --> 00:57:35,327
I've got 20 pages of notes and
a pretty good character for the man.

824
00:57:35,399 --> 00:57:37,090
Write in plenty
of background action...

825
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:38,533
so they'll need
an extra assistant director.

826
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:40,453
Oh, Artie, shut up.

827
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:43,006
- If we could sit down for 2 weeks--
- I'm sorry, Miss Schaefer.

828
00:57:43,078 --> 00:57:46,426
- I've given up writing on spec.
- But this is half sold.

829
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:48,957
As a matter of fact,
I've given up writing altogether.

830
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:50,655
Mr. Gillis.

831
00:57:50,725 --> 00:57:53,059
- If you please.
- I'll be right there.

832
00:57:54,565 --> 00:57:58,077
The accent. I get it. This guy's
in the pay of a foreign government.

833
00:57:58,148 --> 00:58:00,003
Check those studs.
Get those cuff links.

834
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:03,035
I've got to run along. Thanks anyway
for your interest in my career.

835
00:58:03,107 --> 00:58:07,384
It's not your career, it's mine.
I'd hoped to get in on this deal.

836
00:58:07,459 --> 00:58:10,273
I don't want to be a reader
all my life. I want to write.

837
00:58:10,338 --> 00:58:13,818
- I'm sorry if I crossed you up.
- You sure have.

838
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:15,198
So long.

839
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:27,963
What on earth, darling?
It took you hours.

840
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:29,886
I ran into some people I know.

841
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:32,023
- Where are my cigarettes?
- Where are your--

842
00:58:34,783 --> 00:58:36,637
Norma, you're smoking too much.

843
00:58:39,965 --> 00:58:42,932
Whenever she suspected
I was getting bored...

844
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:45,525
she would put on
a live show for me--

845
00:58:45,597 --> 00:58:47,964
the Norma Desmond Follies.

846
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:51,324
Her first number was always
the Mack Sennett bathing beauty.

847
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:02,611
I can still see myself
in the line.

848
00:59:02,683 --> 00:59:04,821
Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand.

849
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:07,345
Mabel was always
stepping on my feet.

850
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,272
What's the matter with you,
darling?

851
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:11,192
Why are you so glum?

852
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:13,624
Nothing's the matter.
I'm having a great time.

853
00:59:13,689 --> 00:59:15,860
- Show me some more.
- All right.

854
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:18,578
Give me this.
I need it for a mustache.

855
00:59:18,648 --> 00:59:20,688
Now close your eyes.
Close them.

856
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,260
Something was the matter,
all right.

857
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:32,976
I was thinking about
that girl of Artie's...

858
00:59:33,046 --> 00:59:34,901
that Miss Schaefer.

859
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:38,577
She was so like all us writers
when we first hit Hollywood--

860
00:59:38,645 --> 00:59:40,500
itching with ambition...

861
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:42,637
panting to get
your names up there.

862
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,741
Screenplay by.
Original story by.

863
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:52,715
Audiences don't know somebody
sits down and writes a picture.

864
00:59:52,787 --> 00:59:56,202
They think the actors
make it up as they go along.

865
00:59:56,274 --> 00:59:58,129
Open your eyes.

866
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,747
Madame is wanted
on the telephone.

867
01:00:32,812 --> 01:00:34,667
You know better
than to interrupt me.

868
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:36,674
- Paramount is calling.
- Who?

869
01:00:36,749 --> 01:00:38,275
Paramount studios.

870
01:00:39,531 --> 01:00:41,386
Now!
Now do you believe me?

871
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:43,305
I told you DeMille
would jump at it.

872
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:45,542
It is not Mr. DeMille
in person.

873
01:00:45,611 --> 01:00:48,959
It is someone called Gordon Cole.
He says it is very important.

874
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:50,278
Certainly it's important.

875
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,549
It's important enough for
Mr. DeMille to call me personally.

876
01:00:52,617 --> 01:00:55,486
The very idea of having
some assistant call me!

877
01:00:55,561 --> 01:00:57,284
Say I'm busy and hang up!

878
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,727
Very good, Madame.

879
01:01:04,872 --> 01:01:06,727
How do you like that?

880
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:10,566
We've made 12 pictures together.
His greatest successes!

881
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:11,841
Maybe he's busy shooting.

882
01:01:11,911 --> 01:01:13,766
I know that trick!

883
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:17,179
He's trying to belittle me.
He's trying to get my price down.

884
01:01:17,254 --> 01:01:20,734
I've waited 20 years
for this call.

885
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:24,142
Now DeMille can wait
until I'm good and ready!

886
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:29,674
About three days later
she was good and ready.

887
01:01:29,741 --> 01:01:31,596
Incredible as it may seem...

888
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:35,490
there had been some more of those
urgent calls from Paramount.

889
01:01:35,564 --> 01:01:39,874
So she put on about a half pound of
makeup, fixed it up with a veil...

890
01:01:39,947 --> 01:01:43,427
and set forth
to see DeMille in person.

891
01:01:45,196 --> 01:01:46,951
Madame will pardon me.

892
01:01:47,018 --> 01:01:49,920
The shadow over the left eye
is not quite balanced.

893
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:52,425
Thank you, Max.

894
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,230
Hold that noise!

895
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:13,765
To see Mr. DeMille.
Open the gate.

896
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:16,286
Mr. DeMille is shooting.
You got an appointment?

897
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:18,268
No appointment necessary.

898
01:02:18,342 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm bringing Norma Desmond.

899
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,728
Norma who?

900
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:23,259
Norma Desmond!

901
01:02:24,294 --> 01:02:26,235
Jonesy! Hey, Jonesy!

902
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,164
Yeah?

903
01:02:28,229 --> 01:02:30,400
Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond!

904
01:02:31,492 --> 01:02:33,347
How have you been,
Miss Desmond?

905
01:02:33,412 --> 01:02:34,655
Open the gate.

906
01:02:34,724 --> 01:02:36,927
Sure, Miss Desmond.
Come on, Mac.

907
01:02:36,995 --> 01:02:38,882
They can't drive on the lot
without a pass.

908
01:02:38,947 --> 01:02:40,954
Miss Desmond can.
Come on.

909
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:53,499
- Where's Mr. DeMille shooting?
- Stage 18, Miss Desmond.

910
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:54,779
Thank you, Jonesy.

911
01:02:54,849 --> 01:02:56,703
And teach your friend
some manners.

912
01:02:56,769 --> 01:02:58,743
Without me
he wouldn't have any job...

913
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,823
because without me there
wouldn't be any Paramount studio.

914
01:03:00,896 --> 01:03:02,619
You're right, Miss Desmond.

915
01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:04,062
Go on, Max.

916
01:03:12,062 --> 01:03:13,589
Stage 18.

917
01:03:14,398 --> 01:03:17,048
All right,
notify Henry Wilcoxon.

918
01:03:17,117 --> 01:03:20,499
Just clear a minute. Spread
that thing out so I can see it.

919
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:24,595
Keep quiet back there.

920
01:03:24,669 --> 01:03:26,773
Norma Desmond's coming in
to see Mr. DeMille.

921
01:03:26,843 --> 01:03:30,836
Hit that with a light, somebody,
so I can get a look at that cape.

922
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:34,038
Back up a little bit.

923
01:03:34,107 --> 01:03:36,474
Soldier, get out of the way.
You fellows in the back there.

924
01:03:36,539 --> 01:03:38,775
Norma Desmond's coming in
to see Mr. DeMille.

925
01:03:38,842 --> 01:03:40,216
Norma Desmond?

926
01:03:41,946 --> 01:03:43,222
Wait a minute.

927
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:47,413
Henry Wilcoxon, draw your sword
and raise that drape with it.

928
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:49,488
Samson's lying unconscious
over here.

929
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:52,048
Norma Desmond is coming in
to see you, Mr. DeMille.

930
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,687
- Norma Desmond?
- She must be a million years old.

931
01:03:56,759 --> 01:03:59,028
I hate to think
where that puts me.

932
01:03:59,095 --> 01:04:01,516
- I could be her father.
- I'm very sorry, Mr. DeMille.

933
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:05,420
It must be about
that awful script of hers.

934
01:04:05,494 --> 01:04:07,828
What can I tell her?
What can I say?

935
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:10,992
I'll say you're tied up in the projection room.
I'll give her the brush.

936
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:15,411
Thirty million fans have given her
the brush. Isn't that enough?

937
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,843
- I didn't mean to--
- No, of course you didn't.

938
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:21,934
You didn't know Norma Desmond
as a lovely little girl of 17...

939
01:04:22,004 --> 01:04:24,556
with more courage
and wit and heart...

940
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,732
than ever came together
in one youngster.

941
01:04:26,803 --> 01:04:28,843
I understand she was
a terror to work with.

942
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:31,086
Only toward the end.

943
01:04:31,154 --> 01:04:34,634
You know, a dozen press agents
working overtime...

944
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:37,520
can do terrible things
to the human spirit.

945
01:04:39,473 --> 01:04:40,847
Hold everything.

946
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:49,579
- Don't you want to come along?
- I don't think so.

947
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:51,621
It's your script, it's your show.
Good luck.

948
01:04:51,695 --> 01:04:53,069
Thank you, dearest.

949
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,697
Well, hello, young fella.

950
01:04:58,766 --> 01:05:01,733
- Hello, Mr. DeMille.
- It's good to see you.

951
01:05:01,806 --> 01:05:04,358
The last time I saw you
was someplace very gay.

952
01:05:04,429 --> 01:05:07,178
I remember waving to you.
I was dancing on a table.

953
01:05:07,245 --> 01:05:10,441
A lot of people were.
Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.

954
01:05:10,508 --> 01:05:11,882
Come on in.

955
01:05:14,572 --> 01:05:17,735
Norma, I must apologize
for not calling you.

956
01:05:17,803 --> 01:05:19,658
You'd better.
I'm very angry.

957
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:21,828
Well, you can see
I'm terribly busy.

958
01:05:21,898 --> 01:05:24,549
That's no excuse.
You read the script, of course.

959
01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:26,601
Yes, I did.

960
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:28,521
Then you could've picked up
the telephone yourself...

961
01:05:28,586 --> 01:05:30,920
instead of leaving it
to one of your assistants.

962
01:05:30,985 --> 01:05:33,319
- What assistant?
- Now, don't play innocent.

963
01:05:33,385 --> 01:05:35,240
Somebody named Gordon Cole.

964
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,377
Gordon Cole?

965
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:39,903
And if you hadn't been pretty
darn interested in that script...

966
01:05:39,976 --> 01:05:42,823
he wouldn't have tried to
get me on the telephone ten times.

967
01:05:42,888 --> 01:05:44,349
Gordon Cole.

968
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,809
Norma, I'm in the middle
of a rehearsal.

969
01:05:47,879 --> 01:05:52,221
Why don't you sit here in my chair
and make yourself comfortable.

970
01:05:52,294 --> 01:05:54,148
- Thank you.
- That's a girl.

971
01:05:55,173 --> 01:05:57,028
I won't be a moment.

972
01:05:57,093 --> 01:05:58,816
Bring me a telephone...

973
01:05:58,885 --> 01:06:00,740
and get me Gordon Cole.

974
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,824
Hey! Miss Desmond!

975
01:06:21,058 --> 01:06:24,091
It's me! It's Hog-Eye!

976
01:06:24,162 --> 01:06:26,234
Hello, Hog-Eye.

977
01:06:28,705 --> 01:06:31,039
Let's get a good look at you.

978
01:06:33,888 --> 01:06:35,960
Look. There's Norma Desmond.

979
01:06:36,032 --> 01:06:38,715
Norma Desmond!

980
01:06:38,783 --> 01:06:41,303
- Norma Desmond!
- Why, I thought she was dead.

981
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:43,098
How nice to see you.

982
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,613
Welcome home, Miss Desmond.
You remember me, don't you?

983
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:48,628
- Doesn't she look wonderful?
- Hello, Bessy.

984
01:06:48,702 --> 01:06:50,873
Mr. Wilcoxon,
have you met Miss Desmond?

985
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:52,315
It's a great pleasure.

986
01:06:52,381 --> 01:06:54,836
Gordon, this is C.B. DeMille.

987
01:06:54,909 --> 01:06:56,763
Have you been calling
Norma Desmond?

988
01:06:56,828 --> 01:06:58,355
Yes, Mr. DeMille.

989
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:00,883
It's that car of hers,
an old Isotta-Fraschini.

990
01:07:00,955 --> 01:07:02,810
Her chauffeur drove it on the lot
the other day.

991
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:04,730
It looks just right
for the Crosby picture.

992
01:07:04,795 --> 01:07:06,649
We want to rent it.

993
01:07:07,387 --> 01:07:08,761
Oh, I see.

994
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,893
Well...

995
01:07:11,962 --> 01:07:13,336
thank you very much.

996
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:29,523
Hog-Eye...

997
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,925
turn that light
back where it belongs.

998
01:07:47,124 --> 01:07:48,979
I got hold of Gordon Cole.

999
01:07:49,044 --> 01:07:51,597
Did you see them?
Did you see how they came?

1000
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:55,660
You know, some crazy things
happen in this business, Norma.

1001
01:07:56,691 --> 01:08:00,106
I hope you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

1002
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:01,389
What's the matter, dear?

1003
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:03,084
Nothing.

1004
01:08:03,154 --> 01:08:07,048
I just didn't realize what it would
be like to come back to the studio.

1005
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:09,455
I had no idea
how much I missed it.

1006
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:10,895
We've missed you too, dear.

1007
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:14,059
We'll work again, won't we, Chief?
We'll make our greatest picture.

1008
01:08:14,129 --> 01:08:16,649
- That's why I want to talk to you.
- It's a good script, isn't it?

1009
01:08:17,744 --> 01:08:20,329
Well, it has
some good things in it, yes.

1010
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,498
But it'd be
a very expensive picture.

1011
01:08:23,567 --> 01:08:27,145
I don't care about the money.
I just want to work again.

1012
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:30,029
You don't know what it means
to know that you want me.

1013
01:08:30,094 --> 01:08:32,614
Nothing would please me more,
Norma, if--

1014
01:08:32,685 --> 01:08:33,895
if it were possible.

1015
01:08:33,965 --> 01:08:35,907
And remember, I don't work
before 10:00 in the morning...

1016
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:37,868
and never after 4:30
in the afternoon.

1017
01:08:38,637 --> 01:08:40,524
We're ready for the shot,
Mr. DeMille.

1018
01:08:40,589 --> 01:08:41,799
All right.

1019
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:45,251
Norma, why don't you
just sit here and watch.

1020
01:08:45,324 --> 01:08:47,974
You know, pictures
have changed quite a bit.

1021
01:08:49,003 --> 01:08:50,377
All right, let's go.

1022
01:08:51,435 --> 01:08:52,809
Hit'em all!

1023
01:08:54,859 --> 01:08:56,233
Roll'em.

1024
01:08:57,322 --> 01:08:58,216
Speed!

1025
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,255
You see those offices there,
Mr. Gillis?

1026
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,931
They used to be
Madame's dressing room.

1027
01:09:12,999 --> 01:09:14,974
The whole row.

1028
01:09:15,047 --> 01:09:16,902
That didn't leave much
for Wallace Reid.

1029
01:09:16,967 --> 01:09:19,388
Oh, he had a great big
bungalow on wheels.

1030
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,277
I had the upstairs.

1031
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:24,513
You see where it says
"Readers Department"?

1032
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,444
I remember my walls were covered
with black patent leather.

1033
01:09:37,988 --> 01:09:39,843
I'll be with you in a minute.

1034
01:09:51,906 --> 01:09:54,393
Here's that funny car
Gordon Cole was talking about.

1035
01:09:54,466 --> 01:09:56,571
- Yeah.
- Mind if we look it over?

1036
01:09:56,642 --> 01:09:58,496
What's so funny about it?

1037
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,291
Just so you don't think
I'm a complete swine...

1038
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,173
if there's anything in Dark Windows
you can use, it's all yours.

1039
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,053
For heaven's sakes!
Come on in, have a chair.

1040
01:10:13,118 --> 01:10:14,973
I mean it.
It's no good to me anyway.

1041
01:10:15,038 --> 01:10:16,892
- Help yourself.
- Why should you do that?

1042
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:19,445
If you get 100,000 for it,
buy me some chocolate creams.

1043
01:10:19,518 --> 01:10:21,372
If you get an Oscar,
I get the left foot.

1044
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:23,292
I'd take you up on that.

1045
01:10:23,357 --> 01:10:25,364
I'm just not good enough
to do it all by myself.

1046
01:10:25,437 --> 01:10:27,292
What about all your ideas?

1047
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:29,560
Well, see if they make sense.

1048
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:32,149
To begin with, you should throw out
all that psychological mess--

1049
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:34,074
exploring a killer's sick mind.

1050
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:36,375
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.

1051
01:10:36,443 --> 01:10:39,443
This is a story about teachers--
their threadbare lives and struggles.

1052
01:10:39,515 --> 01:10:42,743
I see her teaching day classes
while he teaches night school.

1053
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:44,752
The first time they meet--

1054
01:10:44,826 --> 01:10:47,160
I haven't time to listen
to the whole plot.

1055
01:10:47,225 --> 01:10:49,330
- I'll make it short.
- I'm sorry. It's your baby now.

1056
01:10:49,401 --> 01:10:52,215
Couldn't we work in the evenings?
Six o'clock in the morning?

1057
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,582
This next month
I'm completely at your disposal.

1058
01:10:54,648 --> 01:10:57,495
- Artie's out of town.
- What's Artie got to do with it?

1059
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,770
We're engaged.

1060
01:10:59,351 --> 01:11:01,522
Oh. Well, good for you.

1061
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,177
- You couldn't find a nicer guy.
- That's what I think.

1062
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:07,061
They're on location in Arizona
making a Western.

1063
01:11:07,126 --> 01:11:09,166
I'm free every evening
and every weekend.

1064
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:11,311
We could work at your place
if you want.

1065
01:11:12,342 --> 01:11:14,381
Look, Betty, it can't be done.

1066
01:11:14,453 --> 01:11:16,657
Now stop being chicken-hearted
and write that story.

1067
01:11:16,725 --> 01:11:19,626
- Honest to goodness, I hate you.
- And don't make it too dreary.

1068
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,442
How about this? She teaches daytimes,
he teaches at night, right?

1069
01:11:23,508 --> 01:11:25,515
They don't even know each other,
but they share the same room.

1070
01:11:25,588 --> 01:11:28,555
It's cheaper that way. As a matter
of fact, they sleep in the same bed.

1071
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:30,514
In shifts, of course.

1072
01:11:31,763 --> 01:11:34,512
Are you kidding?
Because I think it's good.

1073
01:11:34,578 --> 01:11:37,480
- So do I.
- Let me show you where it fits in.

1074
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:38,601
So long.

1075
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:40,746
Oh, you!

1076
01:11:46,193 --> 01:11:47,240
What's the matter?

1077
01:11:47,313 --> 01:11:51,207
I just found out the reason for all
those phone calls from Paramount.

1078
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,319
It's not Madame they want.

1079
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,246
It's her car they want to rent.

1080
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:56,686
What?

1081
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:02,696
Well, good-bye, Norma.
We'll see what we can do.

1082
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:04,621
I'm not worried.
Everything'll be fine.

1083
01:12:04,686 --> 01:12:07,620
The old team together again.
Nothing can stop us.

1084
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,547
The old team. Yeah.

1085
01:12:11,788 --> 01:12:14,122
- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, Mr. DeMille.

1086
01:12:22,763 --> 01:12:24,934
- How'd it go?
- It couldn't have gone better.

1087
01:12:25,003 --> 01:12:26,377
It's practically set.

1088
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:29,890
He has to finish this picture first,
but mine will be his next.

1089
01:12:31,498 --> 01:12:33,472
Get Gordon Cole.

1090
01:12:33,546 --> 01:12:35,847
Tell him to forget
about her car.

1091
01:12:35,913 --> 01:12:38,728
Tell him he can get
another old car someplace.

1092
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:41,607
I'll buy him five old cars,
if necessary.

1093
01:12:48,445 --> 01:12:49,590
After that...

1094
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:54,417
an army of beauty experts invaded
her house on Sunset Boulevard.

1095
01:12:54,493 --> 01:12:57,460
She went through
a merciless series of treatments.

1096
01:12:57,532 --> 01:12:59,636
Like an athlete training
for the Olympic Games...

1097
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:01,463
she counted every calorie...

1098
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:03,800
went to bed every night
at 9:00.

1099
01:13:03,867 --> 01:13:07,128
She was absolutely determined
to be ready--

1100
01:13:07,194 --> 01:13:10,009
ready for those cameras
that would never turn.

1101
01:13:45,365 --> 01:13:47,786
- Joe, darling, are you there?
- Yes, Norma.

1102
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,675
Don't turn around.
Keep your eyes on the book.

1103
01:13:53,107 --> 01:13:54,962
I just came to say good night.

1104
01:13:56,115 --> 01:13:58,449
I don't want you to see me.
I'm not very attractive.

1105
01:13:59,218 --> 01:14:01,836
- Good night.
- I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.

1106
01:14:01,906 --> 01:14:02,953
Good.

1107
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:05,131
I was worried about
the line on my throat.

1108
01:14:05,202 --> 01:14:07,689
- This woman's done wonders with it.
- Good.

1109
01:14:09,393 --> 01:14:11,532
Better get to bed yourself.

1110
01:14:11,601 --> 01:14:13,705
I think I'll read
a little longer.

1111
01:14:14,736 --> 01:14:17,551
You went out last night,
didn't you, Joe?

1112
01:14:17,616 --> 01:14:20,136
- Why do you say that?
- I happen to know it.

1113
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:23,241
I had a nightmare and screamed for you.
You weren't here. Where were you?

1114
01:14:24,622 --> 01:14:28,070
- I went for a walk.
- No, you didn't. You took the car.

1115
01:14:29,358 --> 01:14:31,813
All right,
I drove to the beach.

1116
01:14:31,886 --> 01:14:34,341
You don't want me to feel
I'm locked up in this house.

1117
01:14:34,414 --> 01:14:36,202
Of course not, Joe.

1118
01:14:36,269 --> 01:14:40,043
I just don't want to be left alone
while I'm under this terrible strain.

1119
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:42,629
My nerves
are being torn to shreds.

1120
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:47,402
All I ask is for you to be
a little patient and a little kind.

1121
01:14:48,619 --> 01:14:50,244
I haven't done anything.

1122
01:14:50,315 --> 01:14:52,835
Of course you haven't.

1123
01:14:52,907 --> 01:14:55,143
I wouldn't let you.

1124
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,584
Good night, darling.

1125
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,044
Yes...

1126
01:15:26,117 --> 01:15:29,412
I was playing hooky
every evening along in there.

1127
01:15:29,477 --> 01:15:32,772
It made me think of when I was 12
and used to sneak out on the folks...

1128
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:35,324
to see a gangster picture.

1129
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:37,818
This time it wasn't
to see a picture...

1130
01:15:37,892 --> 01:15:40,444
it was to try and write one.

1131
01:15:40,515 --> 01:15:43,711
That story of mine Betty had dug up
kept going through my head...

1132
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:45,634
Like a dozen locomotives.

1133
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:49,689
So we started working on it,
the two of us...

1134
01:15:49,762 --> 01:15:52,151
nights when the studio
was deserted...

1135
01:15:52,225 --> 01:15:55,040
up in her little cubbyhole
of an office.

1136
01:16:10,335 --> 01:16:12,702
I got the funniest letter
from Artie.

1137
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:15,581
It's rained every day
since they got to Arizona.

1138
01:16:15,646 --> 01:16:18,461
They rewrote the whole picture
for rain and shot half of it.

1139
01:16:19,486 --> 01:16:23,097
Now the sun is out.
Nobody knows when they'll get back.

1140
01:16:23,165 --> 01:16:24,692
- Good.
- What's good about it?

1141
01:16:24,765 --> 01:16:27,131
I miss him something fierce.

1142
01:16:27,196 --> 01:16:29,945
I mean, this is good dialogue here.
It'll play.

1143
01:16:30,012 --> 01:16:31,255
- It will?
- Sure.

1144
01:16:31,323 --> 01:16:34,803
Especially with lots of music
underneath, drowning it out.

1145
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,500
Don't you sometimes
hate yourself?

1146
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:37,946
Constantly.

1147
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,096
No, in all seriousness,
this is really good.

1148
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:44,309
It's fun writing with you.

1149
01:16:44,378 --> 01:16:45,752
Well, thanks.

1150
01:16:59,223 --> 01:17:01,296
Who's Norma?

1151
01:17:02,392 --> 01:17:03,569
Who's who?

1152
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:06,934
I'm sorry. I don't usually
read private cigarette cases.

1153
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:09,070
Oh, that.

1154
01:17:09,142 --> 01:17:11,378
It's from a friend of mine.

1155
01:17:11,446 --> 01:17:13,038
A middle-aged lady.

1156
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:15,018
Very foolish and very generous.

1157
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:17,264
I'll say.
This is solid gold.

1158
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,667
I gave her some advice
on an idiotic script.

1159
01:17:19,732 --> 01:17:21,707
Oh, the old familiar story.

1160
01:17:21,781 --> 01:17:24,300
You help a timid little soul
cross a crowded street.

1161
01:17:24,371 --> 01:17:26,226
She turns out to be
a multimillionaire...

1162
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:28,625
and leaves you all her money.

1163
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:32,073
That's the trouble with you
readers-- you know all the plots.

1164
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,278
Suppose you proofread page ten
while the water boils.

1165
01:17:35,346 --> 01:17:36,939
- Okay?
- Okay.

1166
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:03,081
Sometimes,
when we got stuck...

1167
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:06,051
we'd make a little tour
of the drowsing lot.

1168
01:18:06,126 --> 01:18:08,035
Not talking much...

1169
01:18:08,109 --> 01:18:11,457
just wandering down alleys
between the soundstages...

1170
01:18:11,532 --> 01:18:14,630
or through the sets they were getting
ready for the next day's shooting.

1171
01:18:15,756 --> 01:18:17,512
As a matter of fact...

1172
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:21,125
it was on one of those walks when
she first told me about her nose.

1173
01:18:21,195 --> 01:18:23,017
Look at this street.

1174
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:27,337
All cardboard, all hollow,
all phony, all done with mirrors.

1175
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:31,460
You know, I like it better
than any street in the world.

1176
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:34,344
Maybe because I used to play here
when I was a kid.

1177
01:18:35,528 --> 01:18:37,699
What were you,
a child actress?

1178
01:18:37,768 --> 01:18:40,583
No, I was born just two blocks
from this studio...

1179
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:42,502
right on Lemon Grove Avenue.

1180
01:18:42,568 --> 01:18:44,934
My father was head electrician here
till he died.

1181
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:47,901
- Mother still works in wardrobe.
- Second generation, huh?

1182
01:18:47,975 --> 01:18:50,560
Third. Grandma did stunt work
for Pearl White.

1183
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:52,485
I come from a picture family.

1184
01:18:52,551 --> 01:18:54,787
Naturally they expected me
to become a great star...

1185
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:58,945
so I had ten years of dramatic
lessons, diction, dancing.

1186
01:18:59,014 --> 01:19:02,842
Then the studio made a test.
Well, they didn't like my nose.

1187
01:19:02,916 --> 01:19:04,771
Slanted this way a little.

1188
01:19:04,836 --> 01:19:06,494
So I had it fixed.

1189
01:19:06,564 --> 01:19:09,182
They made more tests,
and they were crazy about my nose.

1190
01:19:09,252 --> 01:19:11,618
Only they didn't like my acting.

1191
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:15,841
- Nice job.
- It should be.

1192
01:19:15,906 --> 01:19:18,175
It cost me $300.

1193
01:19:18,242 --> 01:19:19,802
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

1194
01:19:19,874 --> 01:19:22,263
Not at all.
It taught me a little sense.

1195
01:19:22,338 --> 01:19:25,305
I got a job in the mail room,
and now I'm a reader.

1196
01:19:25,377 --> 01:19:26,686
Come clean, Betty.

1197
01:19:26,753 --> 01:19:29,688
At night you weep for those lost
close-ups, those gala openings.

1198
01:19:29,761 --> 01:19:33,535
Not once. What's wrong with being
on the other side of the cameras?

1199
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,160
It's really more fun.

1200
01:19:35,232 --> 01:19:37,501
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer.

1201
01:19:37,567 --> 01:19:40,381
- I will now kiss that nose of yours.
- If you please.

1202
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:48,028
May I say
that you smell real special?

1203
01:19:48,094 --> 01:19:49,948
Must be my new shampoo.

1204
01:19:51,005 --> 01:19:53,426
That's no shampoo.

1205
01:19:53,501 --> 01:19:56,796
It's more like freshly laundered
linen handkerchiefs...

1206
01:19:56,861 --> 01:19:58,715
Like a brand-new automobile.

1207
01:20:00,092 --> 01:20:02,514
- How old are you, anyway?
- Twenty-two.

1208
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:05,495
Smart girl.

1209
01:20:05,563 --> 01:20:07,417
Nothing like being 22.

1210
01:20:08,794 --> 01:20:11,609
And may I suggest that if were
ever to finish this story...

1211
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:14,008
you stay at least
two feet away from me.

1212
01:20:15,098 --> 01:20:19,407
The first time I come any closer,
clunk me on the head with a shoe.

1213
01:20:21,465 --> 01:20:23,636
Now back to the typewriters...

1214
01:20:23,704 --> 01:20:25,559
by way of Washington Square.

1215
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:12,111
What is it, Max?

1216
01:21:12,177 --> 01:21:14,348
Want to wash the car?

1217
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:17,482
Or are you doing a little spying
in your off hours?

1218
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:20,847
You must be very careful
as you cross the patio.

1219
01:21:20,912 --> 01:21:22,286
Madame may be watching.

1220
01:21:22,351 --> 01:21:25,515
Will going up the kitchen stairs
and undressing in the dark do it?

1221
01:21:26,575 --> 01:21:29,390
I'm not inquiring
where Mr. Gillis goes every night.

1222
01:21:29,455 --> 01:21:31,145
Why don't you?

1223
01:21:31,214 --> 01:21:32,840
I'm writing a script...

1224
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:35,211
and I'm gonna finish it
no matter what.

1225
01:21:35,277 --> 01:21:39,433
It is just that I am
greatly worried about Madame.

1226
01:21:39,501 --> 01:21:41,257
Sure, you are.

1227
01:21:41,325 --> 01:21:43,180
And we're not helping her any...

1228
01:21:43,245 --> 01:21:47,554
feeding her lies and more lies,
getting herself ready for a picture.

1229
01:21:47,628 --> 01:21:49,482
What happens
when she finds out?

1230
01:21:49,548 --> 01:21:51,402
She never will.

1231
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:55,873
That is my job,
and it has been for a long time.

1232
01:21:56,906 --> 01:21:58,564
You must understand...

1233
01:21:58,634 --> 01:22:01,383
I discovered her
when she was 16.

1234
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:02,943
I made her a star...

1235
01:22:03,017 --> 01:22:06,813
and I cannot let her
be destroyed.

1236
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:08,263
You made her a star?

1237
01:22:08,329 --> 01:22:09,670
Yes.

1238
01:22:09,736 --> 01:22:12,867
I directed
all her early films.

1239
01:22:12,936 --> 01:22:16,896
There were three young directors
who showed promise in those days--

1240
01:22:16,967 --> 01:22:18,723
D.W. Griffith...

1241
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:20,700
Cecil B. DeMille...

1242
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:22,400
and Max Von Mayerling.

1243
01:22:24,038 --> 01:22:26,427
And she's turned you
into a servant.

1244
01:22:26,502 --> 01:22:30,756
It was I who asked to come back,
humiliating as it may seem.

1245
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:33,538
I could have continued my career.

1246
01:22:33,605 --> 01:22:37,533
Only I found everything unendurable
after she had left me.

1247
01:22:38,756 --> 01:22:40,130
You see...

1248
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:43,585
I was her first husband.

1249
01:23:09,376 --> 01:23:10,750
You're here, Joe.

1250
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:14,526
When did you come home?

1251
01:23:18,878 --> 01:23:21,212
Oh, Joe, where were you?

1252
01:23:22,685 --> 01:23:23,895
Is it a woman?

1253
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:26,201
I know it's a woman.
Who is she?

1254
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:28,570
Why can't I ask you?

1255
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:30,164
I must know.

1256
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:23,666
What's the matter?

1257
01:24:26,835 --> 01:24:29,802
Betty, wake up. Why are you
staring at me like that?

1258
01:24:31,955 --> 01:24:33,809
Oh, was I?
I'm sorry.

1259
01:24:35,122 --> 01:24:37,610
What's wrong with you tonight?

1260
01:24:37,682 --> 01:24:39,275
What is it?

1261
01:24:39,346 --> 01:24:41,899
Something came up.
I don't want to talk about it.

1262
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:43,344
Why not?

1263
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:51,847
I just don't.

1264
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:01,197
What have you heard?

1265
01:25:02,254 --> 01:25:04,774
Come on, let's have it.

1266
01:25:04,846 --> 01:25:06,701
Is it about me?

1267
01:25:19,308 --> 01:25:21,828
There's no use
running out on it.

1268
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,321
Let's face it,
whatever it is.

1269
01:25:24,395 --> 01:25:27,242
I got a telegram from Artie.

1270
01:25:27,306 --> 01:25:28,997
From Artie?

1271
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:30,725
What's wrong?

1272
01:25:30,794 --> 01:25:33,608
He wants me
to come on to Arizona.

1273
01:25:33,673 --> 01:25:36,968
He says it only costs two dollars
to get married there.

1274
01:25:38,473 --> 01:25:41,254
It would kind a save us
a honeymoon.

1275
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:42,847
Well, why don't you?

1276
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,254
We can finish the script
by Thursday.

1277
01:25:46,856 --> 01:25:50,303
Stop crying. You're getting married.
That's what you wanted.

1278
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:52,230
I don't want it now.

1279
01:25:53,447 --> 01:25:56,675
- Why not? Don't you love Artie?
- Of course I love him.

1280
01:25:56,742 --> 01:25:58,117
I always will.

1281
01:26:01,221 --> 01:26:04,036
I'm not in love with him
anymore, that's all.

1282
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,499
What happened?

1283
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:09,443
You did.

1284
01:26:22,441 --> 01:26:25,440
It wasn't until I got back
to that peculiar prison of mine...

1285
01:26:25,512 --> 01:26:27,846
that I started facing the facts.

1286
01:26:29,831 --> 01:26:31,522
There it was.

1287
01:26:31,592 --> 01:26:35,421
Betty Schaefer's future
right in the palm of my hand.

1288
01:26:35,494 --> 01:26:37,828
Betty Schaefer,
engaged to Artie Green...

1289
01:26:37,894 --> 01:26:40,577
as nice a guy as ever lived...

1290
01:26:40,646 --> 01:26:43,133
and she was in love with me.

1291
01:26:43,206 --> 01:26:44,831
Me.

1292
01:26:56,163 --> 01:27:00,440
She was a fool not to sense there
was something phony in my setup...

1293
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,653
and I was a heel
not to have told her.

1294
01:27:03,682 --> 01:27:07,544
But you just can't say those things
to somebody youre crazy about.

1295
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:10,715
Maybe I'd never have to.

1296
01:27:10,786 --> 01:27:13,687
Maybe I could get away with it,
get away from Norma.

1297
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:17,208
Maybe I could wipe the whole
nasty mess right out of my life.

1298
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:29,303
Hello?
Is this Gladstone 9-2-8-1?

1299
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,644
May I speak
to Miss Betty Schaefer?

1300
01:27:31,711 --> 01:27:33,565
She must be home by now.

1301
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:39,317
Here's that
weird-sounding woman again.

1302
01:27:39,389 --> 01:27:41,396
Well, what is this, anyway?

1303
01:27:42,684 --> 01:27:44,539
This is Betty Schaefer.

1304
01:27:44,604 --> 01:27:46,993
You must forgive me
for calling you so late...

1305
01:27:47,068 --> 01:27:48,923
but I really feel
it's my duty.

1306
01:27:48,988 --> 01:27:52,283
It's about Mr. Gillis.
You do know Mr. Gillis.

1307
01:27:53,755 --> 01:27:56,089
Exactly how much
do you know about him?

1308
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:00,308
Do you know where he lives?

1309
01:28:00,378 --> 01:28:02,287
Do you know how he lives?

1310
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:04,434
Do you know what he lives on?

1311
01:28:04,505 --> 01:28:06,031
Who are you?

1312
01:28:06,105 --> 01:28:08,920
What do you want?
What business is it of yours?

1313
01:28:08,985 --> 01:28:10,610
Miss Schaefer...

1314
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,101
I'm trying to do you a favor.

1315
01:28:13,176 --> 01:28:16,558
I'm trying to spare you
a great deal of misery.

1316
01:28:16,631 --> 01:28:20,427
But you may be too young to even
suspect there are men of his sort.

1317
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:25,391
I don't know what he's told you,
but he does not live with relatives.

1318
01:28:25,463 --> 01:28:28,757
Nor with friends,
in the usual sense of the word.

1319
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:31,636
Well, ask him.

1320
01:28:31,701 --> 01:28:33,075
Ask him again.

1321
01:28:37,556 --> 01:28:39,727
That's right, Betty.
Ask me again.

1322
01:28:39,796 --> 01:28:40,876
This is Joe.

1323
01:28:43,507 --> 01:28:45,514
Where are you?
What is this all about?

1324
01:28:47,186 --> 01:28:50,699
Or better yet, why don't you
come out and see for yourself.

1325
01:28:50,771 --> 01:28:53,258
The address is 10086...

1326
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:55,185
Sunset Boulevard.

1327
01:29:09,327 --> 01:29:10,756
Don't hate me, Joe.

1328
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:13,260
I did it because I need you.

1329
01:29:13,327 --> 01:29:16,141
I need you as I've
never needed you before.

1330
01:29:16,206 --> 01:29:17,733
Look at me.

1331
01:29:17,806 --> 01:29:19,944
Look at my hands.
Look at my face.

1332
01:29:20,014 --> 01:29:22,153
Look under my eyes.

1333
01:29:22,222 --> 01:29:25,352
How can I go back to work if
I'm wasting away under this torment?

1334
01:29:25,421 --> 01:29:28,203
You don't know what I've been
through these last weeks.

1335
01:29:35,435 --> 01:29:37,606
I bought myself a revolver.
I did.

1336
01:29:37,675 --> 01:29:40,642
I stood in front of that mirror,
but I couldn't make myself do it.

1337
01:29:41,354 --> 01:29:43,209
Don't just stand there
hating me!

1338
01:29:43,274 --> 01:29:44,256
Shout at me!

1339
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:46,664
Strike me,
but don't hate me!

1340
01:29:47,946 --> 01:29:50,280
Say you don't hate me, Joe!

1341
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:06,914
Here's 10079, Connie.

1342
01:30:06,983 --> 01:30:08,837
It must be over there.

1343
01:30:17,381 --> 01:30:20,195
Betty, let me come along
with you, please.

1344
01:30:20,261 --> 01:30:22,115
No, I'll be all right.

1345
01:30:38,914 --> 01:30:41,947
What are you gonna do, Joe?
What are you gonna do?

1346
01:30:50,048 --> 01:30:52,731
It's all right, Max.
I'll take it.

1347
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,847
Hello, Betty.

1348
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,774
I don't know why
I'm so scared, Joe.

1349
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,174
- Is it something awful?
- Come on in.

1350
01:31:04,382 --> 01:31:07,644
Ever been in one of these
old Hollywood palazzos?

1351
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:11,255
That's from when they were
making 18,000 a week and no taxes.

1352
01:31:11,325 --> 01:31:13,212
Careful of these tiles.
They're slippery.

1353
01:31:13,277 --> 01:31:15,732
Valentino used to dance here.

1354
01:31:15,805 --> 01:31:18,139
- Is this where you live?
- You bet.

1355
01:31:19,612 --> 01:31:21,783
- Whose house is it?
- Hers.

1356
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,186
- Whose?
- Just look around.

1357
01:31:24,251 --> 01:31:26,105
There's a lot of her
spread about.

1358
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:28,985
If you don't remember the face,
you must've heard the name--

1359
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,424
Norma Desmond?

1360
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,305
That was Norma Desmond
on the phone?

1361
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:35,704
Would you like a drink?
There's always champagne on ice.

1362
01:31:35,769 --> 01:31:36,979
Plenty of caviar.

1363
01:31:37,049 --> 01:31:39,383
- Why did she call me?
- Jealous.

1364
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:42,583
Did you ever see so much junk?

1365
01:31:42,648 --> 01:31:45,233
She had the ceiling
brought from Portugal.

1366
01:31:45,304 --> 01:31:47,159
And look at this.

1367
01:31:49,527 --> 01:31:51,414
Her own movie theater.

1368
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:53,780
I didn't come here
to see a house.

1369
01:31:53,847 --> 01:31:55,221
What about Norma Desmond?

1370
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:59,307
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

1371
01:31:59,382 --> 01:32:01,618
This is an enormous place.

1372
01:32:01,685 --> 01:32:03,627
Eight master bedrooms.

1373
01:32:03,702 --> 01:32:06,352
A sunken tub in every bathroom.

1374
01:32:06,421 --> 01:32:08,755
There's a bowling alley
in the cellar.

1375
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,747
It's lonely here...

1376
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:14,674
so she got herself
a companion.

1377
01:32:15,731 --> 01:32:17,836
Very simple setup.

1378
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:19,761
Older woman who's well-to-do.

1379
01:32:21,427 --> 01:32:23,761
Younger man
who's not doing too well.

1380
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:28,106
- Can you figure it out yourself?
- No.

1381
01:32:28,177 --> 01:32:30,217
I'll give you
a few more clues.

1382
01:32:30,289 --> 01:32:31,816
No!

1383
01:32:31,889 --> 01:32:33,799
I haven't heard any of this.

1384
01:32:33,872 --> 01:32:36,839
I never got those phone calls,
and I've never been in this house.

1385
01:32:37,905 --> 01:32:40,141
Now get your things together
and let's get out of here.

1386
01:32:42,063 --> 01:32:43,754
All my things?

1387
01:32:43,823 --> 01:32:46,572
All my 18 suits
and my custom-made shoes...

1388
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,526
and the six-dozen shirts
and cuff links...

1389
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:51,405
and the platinum key chains
and the cigarette cases?

1390
01:32:52,462 --> 01:32:53,770
Come on, Joe.

1391
01:32:54,829 --> 01:32:56,203
Come on where?

1392
01:32:56,269 --> 01:32:59,084
Back to a one-room apartment
I can't pay for?

1393
01:32:59,149 --> 01:33:02,280
Back to a story that may sell
and very possibly will not?

1394
01:33:02,349 --> 01:33:04,137
If you love me, Joe--

1395
01:33:05,164 --> 01:33:06,625
Look, sweetie, be practical.

1396
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,555
I've got a good deal here.

1397
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:11,107
A long-term contract
with no options.

1398
01:33:11,179 --> 01:33:13,546
I like it that way.

1399
01:33:13,611 --> 01:33:15,465
Maybe it's not very admirable.

1400
01:33:18,026 --> 01:33:19,684
Well...

1401
01:33:19,754 --> 01:33:21,608
you and Artie can be admirable.

1402
01:33:24,489 --> 01:33:26,823
I can't look at you
anymore, Joe.

1403
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,454
How about looking for the exit?

1404
01:33:33,576 --> 01:33:34,950
This way, Betty.

1405
01:33:49,638 --> 01:33:51,906
Good luck to you, Betty.

1406
01:33:51,973 --> 01:33:54,787
You can finish that script
on the way to Arizona.

1407
01:33:56,228 --> 01:34:00,188
When you and Artie get back, if you
two ever feel like taking a swim...

1408
01:34:01,571 --> 01:34:02,945
here's the pool.

1409
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:47,518
Thank you, darling.

1410
01:34:47,584 --> 01:34:48,958
Thank you, Joe.

1411
01:35:16,411 --> 01:35:18,266
May I come in, Joe?

1412
01:35:18,331 --> 01:35:19,989
I've stopped crying.

1413
01:35:20,059 --> 01:35:21,968
I'm all right again.

1414
01:35:22,043 --> 01:35:23,733
Tell me you're not cross.

1415
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:26,617
Tell me everything
is just as it was, Joe.

1416
01:35:34,201 --> 01:35:36,055
What are you doing, Joe?

1417
01:35:41,815 --> 01:35:43,244
What are you doing?

1418
01:35:43,319 --> 01:35:45,042
I'm packing.

1419
01:35:47,639 --> 01:35:48,849
You're leaving me.

1420
01:35:48,919 --> 01:35:50,162
Yes, I am, Norma.

1421
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:52,564
No, you're not.

1422
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:54,036
Max! Max!

1423
01:35:54,901 --> 01:35:57,235
Thanks for letting me
wear the handsome wardrobe...

1424
01:35:57,301 --> 01:36:00,116
and thanks for the use
of all the trinkets.

1425
01:36:02,324 --> 01:36:04,179
The rest of the jewelry's
in the top drawer.

1426
01:36:04,244 --> 01:36:07,058
- It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
- And I'd take it in a second.

1427
01:36:07,123 --> 01:36:10,156
Only it's too dressy for sitting
behind a copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.

1428
01:36:10,227 --> 01:36:11,601
These are nothing!

1429
01:36:11,667 --> 01:36:14,481
You can have anything you want.
What is it you want?

1430
01:36:15,986 --> 01:36:17,841
Money?

1431
01:36:17,906 --> 01:36:19,761
Norma, you'd be throwing it away.

1432
01:36:19,826 --> 01:36:21,931
I don't qualify for the job.
Not anymore.

1433
01:36:22,002 --> 01:36:23,212
You can't go!

1434
01:36:23,281 --> 01:36:24,873
Max! Max!

1435
01:36:24,944 --> 01:36:26,951
I can't face life without you.

1436
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,694
And you know
I'm not afraid to die.

1437
01:36:31,759 --> 01:36:33,614
That's between you and yourself.

1438
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:36,810
You think I made that up about
the gun, don't you? All right.

1439
01:36:45,869 --> 01:36:47,430
See?

1440
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:50,316
You didn't believe me. Now I suppose
you don't think I have the courage.

1441
01:36:50,381 --> 01:36:52,236
Oh, sure, if it would
make a good scene.

1442
01:36:52,301 --> 01:36:55,268
You don't care, do you? But hundreds
of thousands of people will care!

1443
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,958
Oh, wake up, Norma. You'd be
killing yourself to an empty house.

1444
01:36:58,028 --> 01:36:59,686
The audience left
20 years ago.

1445
01:36:59,755 --> 01:37:02,275
- That's a lie! They still want me!
- No, they don't!

1446
01:37:03,307 --> 01:37:04,681
What about DeMille?

1447
01:37:04,747 --> 01:37:06,602
He was trying
to spare your feelings.

1448
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:08,838
The studio only wanted
to rent your car.

1449
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:09,953
Wanted what?

1450
01:37:10,026 --> 01:37:13,374
DeMille didn't have the heart to
tell you. None of us has had the heart.

1451
01:37:13,449 --> 01:37:15,751
That's a lie.
They want me.

1452
01:37:15,817 --> 01:37:17,671
I get letters every day.

1453
01:37:18,889 --> 01:37:20,449
You tell her, Max.

1454
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:23,781
Do her that favor. Tell her there
isn't going to be any picture.

1455
01:37:23,848 --> 01:37:26,662
There aren't any fan letters
except the ones you write.

1456
01:37:26,727 --> 01:37:28,320
That isn't true!

1457
01:37:28,391 --> 01:37:29,983
Max!

1458
01:37:30,055 --> 01:37:32,641
Madame is the greatest star
of them all.

1459
01:37:33,831 --> 01:37:36,830
I will take Mr. Gillis's bags
to the car.

1460
01:37:42,757 --> 01:37:44,579
You heard him.

1461
01:37:44,645 --> 01:37:46,914
I'm a star.

1462
01:37:46,981 --> 01:37:49,795
Norma, you're a woman of 50.
Now grow up.

1463
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,999
There's nothing tragic
about being 50...

1464
01:37:52,068 --> 01:37:54,304
not unless you try to be 25.

1465
01:37:54,371 --> 01:37:57,021
I'm the greatest star
of them all.

1466
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:04,224
Good-bye, Norma.

1467
01:38:06,593 --> 01:38:08,927
No one ever leaves a star.

1468
01:38:08,993 --> 01:38:11,000
That's what makes one a star.

1469
01:39:03,385 --> 01:39:05,970
Stars are ageless...

1470
01:39:06,041 --> 01:39:07,415
aren't they?

1471
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:17,345
Well, this is where you came in.

1472
01:39:17,421 --> 01:39:18,948
Back at that pool again--

1473
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:21,413
the one I always wanted.

1474
01:39:22,444 --> 01:39:26,666
It's dawn now, and they must have
photographed me a thousand times.

1475
01:39:26,732 --> 01:39:30,506
Then they got some pruning hooks
from the garden and fished me out...

1476
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:31,946
ever so gently.

1477
01:39:33,002 --> 01:39:35,522
Funny how gentle people get with you
once you're dead.

1478
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:40,934
They beached me
like a harpooned baby whale...

1479
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:43,489
and started
to check the damage...

1480
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:44,935
just for the record.

1481
01:39:47,144 --> 01:39:49,282
By this time
the whole joint was jumping--

1482
01:39:49,352 --> 01:39:52,483
cops, reporters,
neighbors, passersby.

1483
01:39:52,551 --> 01:39:54,885
As much hoop-de-doo
as we get in Los Angeles...

1484
01:39:54,951 --> 01:39:56,806
when they open a supermarket.

1485
01:39:56,871 --> 01:39:59,107
Even the newsreel guys
came roaring in.

1486
01:39:59,174 --> 01:40:01,989
Here was an item everybody
could have some fun with.

1487
01:40:03,366 --> 01:40:05,373
The heartless so-and-sos.

1488
01:40:06,853 --> 01:40:08,828
What would they do to Norma?

1489
01:40:08,901 --> 01:40:11,170
Even if she got away with it
in court--

1490
01:40:11,237 --> 01:40:14,303
crime of passion,
temporary insanity--

1491
01:40:14,373 --> 01:40:16,991
those headlines would kill her.

1492
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:19,994
"Forgotten Star a Slayer:"

1493
01:40:20,068 --> 01:40:22,239
"Aging Actress:"

1494
01:40:22,307 --> 01:40:24,543
"Yesterday's Glamour Queen:"

1495
01:40:34,466 --> 01:40:36,407
Coroner's office?

1496
01:40:36,481 --> 01:40:38,336
I want to speak to the coroner.

1497
01:40:39,648 --> 01:40:41,023
Who's on this phone?

1498
01:40:41,089 --> 01:40:44,765
I am! Now get off.
This is more important.

1499
01:40:44,832 --> 01:40:46,872
Times city desk?
Hedda Hopper speaking.

1500
01:40:46,944 --> 01:40:49,245
I'm talking from the bedroom
of Norma Desmond.

1501
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:51,896
Don't bother with a rewrite.
Take it direct.

1502
01:40:51,966 --> 01:40:53,014
Ready?

1503
01:40:53,086 --> 01:40:54,941
As day breaks
over the murder house...

1504
01:40:55,006 --> 01:40:57,340
Norma Desmond,
famous star of yesteryear...

1505
01:40:57,406 --> 01:41:00,308
is in a state
of complete mental shock.

1506
01:41:00,382 --> 01:41:02,902
A curtain of silence
seems to have fallen around her.

1507
01:41:02,973 --> 01:41:05,820
She sits in the silken boudoir
of her house on Sunset Boulevard--

1508
01:41:05,885 --> 01:41:09,746
Was it a sudden quarrel? Did you ever
have any trouble between you before?

1509
01:41:10,651 --> 01:41:13,684
If it was a quarrel,
how come this gun was right there?

1510
01:41:13,755 --> 01:41:16,624
This guy-- Where did you meet him
for the first time?

1511
01:41:16,699 --> 01:41:18,554
Where did he come from?
Who is he?

1512
01:41:18,619 --> 01:41:20,113
Did you hate him?

1513
01:41:20,187 --> 01:41:22,772
Had you ever thought of
doing something like this before?

1514
01:41:22,842 --> 01:41:24,303
Was theft involved?

1515
01:41:24,378 --> 01:41:27,574
Did you catch him stealing,
or find he had stolen something?

1516
01:41:27,641 --> 01:41:29,234
Newsreel men are here
with the cameras.

1517
01:41:29,305 --> 01:41:32,207
Tell them to go fly a kite.
This is no time for cameras.

1518
01:41:33,304 --> 01:41:36,599
Now, Miss Desmond, is there
anything you want to tell us?

1519
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,661
Cameras?

1520
01:41:42,135 --> 01:41:43,509
What is it, Max?

1521
01:41:48,023 --> 01:41:49,811
The cameras have arrived.

1522
01:41:49,878 --> 01:41:51,733
They have?

1523
01:41:51,798 --> 01:41:54,252
Tell Mr. DeMille
I'll be on the set at once.

1524
01:41:55,029 --> 01:41:56,174
What is this?

1525
01:42:00,692 --> 01:42:03,026
Well, it's one way
to get her downstairs.

1526
01:42:04,692 --> 01:42:06,699
Let's have the car right outside.

1527
01:42:08,371 --> 01:42:09,745
Okay.

1528
01:42:10,835 --> 01:42:12,689
Everything will be ready, Madame.

1529
01:42:12,754 --> 01:42:14,129
Thank you, Max.

1530
01:42:15,155 --> 01:42:16,681
You'll pardon me, gentlemen...

1531
01:42:16,754 --> 01:42:19,088
but I must get ready
for my scene.

1532
01:42:20,754 --> 01:42:22,924
- What's happening up there?
- Why did she do it?

1533
01:42:22,994 --> 01:42:24,422
Is there a confession?

1534
01:42:25,584 --> 01:42:28,334
- Everything set up, gentlemen?
- Just about.

1535
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,992
- Lights ready?
- All set.

1536
01:42:47,886 --> 01:42:49,260
Quiet, everybody!

1537
01:42:52,621 --> 01:42:54,376
Lights!

1538
01:42:58,348 --> 01:43:00,006
Are you ready, Norma?

1539
01:43:02,219 --> 01:43:04,074
What is the scene?

1540
01:43:05,259 --> 01:43:06,665
Where am I?

1541
01:43:09,002 --> 01:43:11,141
This is the staircase
of the palace.

1542
01:43:13,737 --> 01:43:15,679
Oh, yes.

1543
01:43:15,753 --> 01:43:16,930
Yes.

1544
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,342
Down below...

1545
01:43:18,409 --> 01:43:20,264
they're waiting
for the princess.

1546
01:43:22,728 --> 01:43:24,321
I'm ready.

1547
01:43:25,064 --> 01:43:26,525
All right.

1548
01:43:26,599 --> 01:43:28,192
Cameras.

1549
01:43:28,264 --> 01:43:29,605
Action!

1550
01:43:32,103 --> 01:43:35,332
So they were turning after all,
those cameras.

1551
01:43:37,318 --> 01:43:40,383
Life, which can be
strangely merciful...

1552
01:43:40,453 --> 01:43:42,787
had taken pity on Norma Desmond.

1553
01:43:43,845 --> 01:43:46,692
The dream she had clung to
so desperately...

1554
01:43:47,780 --> 01:43:49,154
had enfolded her.

1555
01:44:16,288 --> 01:44:19,102
I can't go on with the scene.
I'm too happy.

1556
01:44:20,384 --> 01:44:23,198
Mr. DeMille, do you mind
if I say a few words?

1557
01:44:23,263 --> 01:44:25,270
Thank you.

1558
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:28,060
I want to tell you all how happy
I am to be back in the studio...

1559
01:44:28,127 --> 01:44:30,493
making a picture again!

1560
01:44:30,557 --> 01:44:33,721
You don't know how much
I've missed all of you.

1561
01:44:33,789 --> 01:44:36,309
And I promise you
I'll never desert you again.

1562
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:38,486
Because after Salome
we'll make another picture...

1563
01:44:38,557 --> 01:44:39,931
and another picture!

1564
01:44:40,957 --> 01:44:43,061
You see, this is my life.

1565
01:44:43,132 --> 01:44:44,823
It always will be.

1566
01:44:44,892 --> 01:44:46,485
There's nothing else.

1567
01:44:46,556 --> 01:44:48,465
Just us...

1568
01:44:48,539 --> 01:44:50,393
and the cameras...

1569
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:53,873
and those wonderful people
out there in the dark.

1570
01:44:56,346 --> 01:44:58,866
All right, Mr. DeMille,
I'm ready for my close-up.
