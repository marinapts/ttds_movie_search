1
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,402
- Evening, Mr. Elliott.
- Good evening.

2
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,301
Brrr.

3
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:28,397
- Just sign the book, if you will.
- Yes.

4
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,118
- Been keeping you busy, Mr. Elliott?
- Oh, just nicely.

5
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,673
Went up to Manchester on Monday-
a poisoner.

6
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,160
Baby-farmer at Holloway this morning.
Very ordinary crimes, both of them.

7
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,370
This one we've got for you tomorrow
is something special.

8
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:41,295
Yes, very much so.

9
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:43,464
Even after all my years
in the profession...

10
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,606
I'm quite looking forward to him.

11
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,619
- Well, I must be getting along.
- Good night, Mr. Elliott.

12
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,612
<i>- Good night.
- Usual cup of tea at 7:00?</i>

13
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,531
Oh, please.

14
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:55,205
Even my lamented master,
the great Mr. Berry himself...

15
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:57,510
never had the privilege
of hanging a duke.

16
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,171
Yes.

17
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:02,120
What a finale to a lifetime
in the public service.

18
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:04,933
- "Finale"?
- Yes, I intend to retire.

19
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:07,420
After using the silken rope...

20
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:10,559
never again be content with hemp.

21
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:13,028
- Quite. Well, here we are.
- Oh, thank you.

22
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:30,814
How will he approach it?

23
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,276
I should think
as the calmest you've ever known.

24
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:36,089
Noblesse oblige, doubtless.

25
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:40,464
A difficult client can make things
most distressing.

26
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,221
Some of them tend
to be very hysterical.

27
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:45,143
So inconsiderate.

28
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:49,014
Well, Colonel, considering
the importance of the occasion...

29
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:51,118
I shall retire early.

30
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:55,530
The last execution of a duke in this country
was really badly bungled.

31
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:58,091
That was in the old days of the ax,
of course.

32
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,170
Yes.

33
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,795
Oh, I - I almost forgot.

34
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:05,745
Um, you must forgive my ignorance...

35
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,688
but when we meet in the morning...

36
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:11,151
what is the correct form of address?

37
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:13,581
- Your Lordship?
- Your Grace.

38
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,841
<i>Your Grace? Oh.</i>

39
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,762
Thank you.

40
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,661
Good morning, Your Grace.

41
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,672
Good morning, Your Grace.

42
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:39,778
- All right. Sit down.
- Ah, good evening, Colonel. Glass of wine?

43
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,364
Good evening, Your Grace.
Uh, thank you, no.

44
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:46,362
I, uh - I called to inquire whether
you had any special wishes for breakfast.

45
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,368
Just coffee and a slice of toast, thank you.

46
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:51,294
Oh, and perhaps a few grapes.

47
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,214
I hate to disappoint
the newspaper-reading public...

48
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:56,126
but it'll be too early
for the conventional hearty breakfast.

49
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:58,131
The appointment is at 8:00,
is it not?

50
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:00,124
At 8:00, uh, yes.

51
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:03,765
If I may venture to say so,
I am amazed at your calmness.

52
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,986
Dr. Johnson was, as always, right...

53
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,976
when he observed,
"Depend upon it, sir.

54
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,439
"When a man knows that he's going
to be hanged in a few hours...

55
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,925
it concentrates his mind wonderfully. "

56
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:18,292
Yes. Well, if there is nothing further
I can do for you -

57
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,211
Nothing. Thank you, Colonel.

58
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:23,985
We shall have the opportunity of making
our adieus in the morning, I presume.

59
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:25,971
I regret to say, yes.

60
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:30,024
- Good night, Your Grace.
- Good night, Colonel.

61
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:42,313
"A brief history
of the events leading thereto...

62
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,714
<i>"written on the eve ofhis execution...</i>

63
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:48,673

that it may prove not uninteresting...

65

66
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,059
<i>My good man, it is not by my choice
that you keep me company.</i>

67
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:07,809
If you wish to sleep, pray do me
the courtesy of sleeping quietly.

68
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,241
"With so little time
remaining to complete my story...

69
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:16,825
"it is difficult to choose
where to begin it.

70
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:18,816
Perhaps I should begin
at the beginning. "

71
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:24,829
<i>I was a healthy baby,
born of an English mother and Italian father-</i>

72
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:29,937
<i>who succumbed to a heart attack
at the moment of first setting eyes on me.</i>

73
00:06:30,045 --> 00:06:34,004
<i>In the circumstances, it will be understood
that I have but slight memory ofhim.</i>

74
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,691
"The little I know comes from
what Mama told me. "

75
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:59,626
Your father was a very handsome man.

76
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:54,007
<i>Mama was the daughter
of the seventh duke of Chalfont...</i>

77
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,930
<i>of Chalfont Castle.</i>

78
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:59,126
<i>She eloped with her handsome singer...</i>

79
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,642
<i>and exchanged the medieval splendors
of Chalfont Castle...</i>

80
00:08:02,746 --> 00:08:05,079
<i>for the modern conveniences
of number 73...</i>

81
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,380
<i>Balaclava Avenue, S. W.</i>

82
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:19,341
<i>They were poor,
but they had five happy and harmonious years...</i>

83
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:22,924
<i>before my arrival sent Papa
off tojoin the heavenly choir.</i>

84
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,341
<i>Reduced to even deeper poverty
by my father's death...</i>

85
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,261
<i>Mama swallowed her pride...</i>

86
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,846
<i>and made an effort at reconciliation
with her family.</i>

87
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,324
<i>They did not even reply to her letter.</i>

88
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:42,664
<i>In order to keep us both alive,
she was reduced...</i>

89
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:44,998
<i>to the horrible expedient
of taking in a lodger.</i>

90
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:50,464
<i>For him, she had to perform
the most menial tasks.</i>

91
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,790
<i>She felt that her family had conspired
to cheat me of my birthright...</i>

92
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,861
<i>and I passed
from infancy to childhood...</i>

93
00:08:56,966 --> 00:09:00,129
<i>in an atmosphere
of family history and genealogies.</i>

94
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,947
<i>The dukedom had been bestowed...</i>

95
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:06,392
<i>by Charles II
on Colonel Henry D'Ascoyne...</i>

96
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:10,359
<i>for services rendered to His Majesty
during his exile.</i>

97
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,174
<i>Later, for services rendered
to His Majesty...</i>

98
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:17,118
<i>after his restoration by the duchess...</i>

99
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,418
<i>the title was granted
the unique privilege...</i>

100
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,004
<i>of descending by the female
as well as the male line.</i>

101
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,642
<i>- Louis.
- It was therefore theoretically possible...</i>

102
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:30,674
<i>that via Mama I might inherit the dukedom.</i>

103
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:34,097
<i>Mama scraped and saved...</i>

104
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:37,069
<i>and sent me to the best school
she could afford.</i>

105
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,826
<i>One little incident of my school days
occurs to me as amusing...</i>

106
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,932
<i>in relation to my present situation.</i>

107
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,591
Lionel Holland.

108
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,448
What is the Sixth Commandment?

109
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,489
<i>Come, come now.</i>

110
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,855
Someone else then.

111
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,808
I know, please, Miss Waterman.

112
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:56,556
<i>Louis Mazzini. Tell him.</i>

113
00:09:57,903 --> 00:10:00,455
- "Thou shalt not kill. "
- Quite right, Louis.

114
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,947
<i>The Sixth Commandment is
"Thou shalt not kill. "</i>

115
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:04,875
"No, in those days...

116
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,557
"I never had any trouble
with the Sixth Commandment.

117
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:11,935
As to the seventh, I was hardly of an age
to concern myself with it. "

118
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,791
<i>Although I was old enough
to be in love.</i>

119
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,896
<i>So Sibella enters my story.</i>

120
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:20,033
<i>Sibella and her brother, Graham,
were my only close friends...</i>

121
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:22,338
<i>and we grew up together.</i>

122
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,497
<i>In their case, Mama relaxed her objection
to my associating with the local children.</i>

123
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:31,486
<i>At least their father, Dr. Hallward,
was a professional man.</i>

124
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:36,343
Louis, we must think very carefully
about your future.

125
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,652
Well, it should be quite easy
to get a job.

126
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:41,338
Not a job, dear. A career.

127
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:45,619
I had hoped for Cambridge for you.

128
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,028
The D'Ascoynes always go to Trinity.

129
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,939
And then, perhaps, the diplomatic.

130
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:53,719
But I'm afraid it's no use
looking as high as that.

131
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:57,456
However, when you've
passed your examination...

132
00:10:57,562 --> 00:11:00,375
that should equip you for a start
in one of the professions.

133
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:04,050
People of quite good family go into
the professions nowadays, I understand.

134
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,207
Now, who do we know
who could help us?

135
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:12,947
We don't really know anyone,
except the family, and they don't know us.

136
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:15,629
The least we can do
is try once more.

137
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:20,688
I shall write
to Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne.

138
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:23,598
He can surely do something
in that bank of his.

139
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:26,630
Bank, Mama? Is that a profession?

140
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,102
This is a private bank, Louis, dear.

141
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,653
They don't pass money over the counter.

142
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,643
<i>The letter was duly dispatched...</i>

143
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:35,912
<i>and this time we did get an answer.</i>

144
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,109
"Madam, I am instructed
by Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne...

145
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:42,145
"to inform you that he is not aware
of your son's existence...

146
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:45,095
as a member
of the D'Ascoyne family. "

147
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,558
Signed by his secretary.

148
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:51,297
It's very stupid of him - of them all -
not to admit your existence...

149
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:54,080
when one day you might be
duke of Chalfont.

150
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,035
It's a very big "might," Mama.

151
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,499
There must be at least 12 people
before me...

152
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:00,799
to say nothing of the ones
who haven't been born yet.

153
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:03,199
Stranger things have happened.

154
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:06,297
I don't wish to be unchristian,
but in view of their attitude...

155
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:09,748
I could almost wish those 12 people
should all die tomorrow.

156
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:12,893
All except one, Mama.

157
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,804
Because you must be duchess
of Chalfont before I'm duke.

158
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:22,641
It will have to be a job, not a career,
after all, Mama.

159
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:25,234
I'm afraid so, Louis.

160
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:27,475
A D'Ascoyne in trade.

161
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:30,064
<i>Did poor Mama's silly dreaming...</i>

162
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:33,330
<i>plant in my brain some seed
which was afterwards to grow...</i>

163
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,778
<i>into the most sensational
criminal endeavor of the century?</i>

164
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,274
<i>If so, I was not conscious of it
at the time...</i>

165
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,551
<i>for there were things
of more immediate concern.</i>

166
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:44,106
<i>Even potential dukes have to eat.</i>

167
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:47,112
<i>Mr. Perkins,
our lodger for nearly 15 years...</i>

168
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:49,105
<i>did his best to be helpful.</i>

169
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,656
<i>He was employed as shopwalker
in a local drapery store...</i>

170
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,614
<i>and found employment for me there.</i>

171
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,816
<i>The possible future duke of Chalfont...</i>

172
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:59,746
<i>became what was known
as a general assistant at the drapery.</i>

173
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,812
<i>This humiliation continued
for two dispiriting years.</i>

174
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:07,939
<i>And then one day, Mama,
who had broken her glasses...</i>

175
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,277
<i>and could not afford
to have them mended...</i>

176
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:12,711
<i>was knocked down by a tram
near Clapham Junction...</i>

177
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,629
<i>and fatally injured.</i>

178
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:19,554
- Louis.
- Yes, Mama.

179
00:13:20,997 --> 00:13:24,541
I should like to be buried
at Chalfont...

180
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:26,585
in the family vault.

181
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,920
Yes, Mama.

182
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:42,611
<i>I wrote to the duke
informing him of Mama's dying wish.</i>

183
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:45,847
<i>His reply
was the curtest possible refusal.</i>

184
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:50,201
<i>Standing by Mama's poor little grave
in that hideous suburban cemetery...</i>

185
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:54,574
<i>I made an oath that I would revenge
the wrongs her family had done her.</i>

186
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:58,928
<i>It was no more than
a piece of youthful bravado...</i>

187
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:03,307
<i>but it was one of those acorns
from which great oaks are destined to grow.</i>

188
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:06,227
<i>Even then I went so far
as to examine the family tree...</i>

189
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:08,974
<i>and prune it
tojust the living members.</i>

190
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,311
<i>But what could I do to hurt them?</i>

191
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,832
<i>What could I take from them...</i>

192
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:17,165
<i>except, perhaps, their lives?</i>

193
00:14:17,264 --> 00:14:19,784
<i>I indulged for a moment
in a fantasy of all 12 of them...</i>

194
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,505
<i>being wiped out simultaneously
at a family reunion...</i>

195
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,428
<i>by my unseen hand...</i>

196
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:29,129
<i>of the penniless boy from Clapham being
miraculously transplanted to his birthright.</i>

197
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,877
<i>I even speculated
as to how I might contrive it.</i>

198
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:35,238
<i>But there were
other more urgent problems.</i>

199
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:38,533
<i>Mama's tiny income came from an annuity
and had died with her.</i>

200
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,163
<i>The problem ofhow to live
on 25 shillings a week was solved for me...</i>

201
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:47,261
<i>by an invitation from Dr. Hallward
to lodge with them.</i>

202
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:50,909
<i>It was galling to accept the status
of a poor relation...</i>

203
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:54,905
<i>but the certainty of seeing Sibella every day
was too tempting to be refused.</i>

204
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:59,100
Louis, I'm so glad you accepted.

205
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:01,088
It was my idea, you know.

206
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:04,693
- I've brought you something.
- Oh, Louis, you shouldn't have.

207
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,644
You can't possibly afford it.

208
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:12,025
Oh, what a bother. There's Lionel.

209
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:14,011
See you at supper.

210
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:27,602
<i>The next few years
brought many such heartbreaks...</i>

211
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:29,709
<i>but they also brought promotion-</i>

212
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,147
<i>laces and ribbons
at 30 shillings a week...</i>

213
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,928
<i>fabrics at 32 and six.</i>

214
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:39,336
<i>Finally, ladies'underwear at 35.</i>

215
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,893
<i>I decided that
if I was to be a draper...</i>

216
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,858
<i>at least I would not be
a suburban draper.</i>

217
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:57,925
<i>So I migrated to a large modern store which
hadjust been opened in the West End...</i>

218
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:01,026
<i>at the gigantic salary
of two pounds a week.</i>

219
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:06,269
<i>Every lunchtime I went to see
how my inheritance was proceeding.</i>

220
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:08,830
<i>Sometimes the deaths column
brought good news.</i>

221
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,572
<i>Sometimes
the births column brought bad.</i>

222
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:25,563
<i>The advent of twin sons to the duke
was a terrible blow.</i>

223
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:30,334
<i>Fortunately,
an epidemic of diphtheria...</i>

224
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:33,114
<i>restored the status quo
almost immediately...</i>

225
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:36,858
<i>and even brought me a bonus
in the shape of the duchess.</i>

226
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:39,541
<i>That summer
the Hallwards gave a party.</i>

227
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:51,116
- Good evening, Sibella.
- Hello, Louis.

228
00:16:51,223 --> 00:16:54,005
- You do look nice.
- So do you.

229
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:57,397
- Doesn't he, Lionel?
- Very.

230
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:07,016
<i>Emboldened by her kindness to me...</i>

231
00:17:07,122 --> 00:17:10,023
<i>I made a decision
I'd been toying with for some time.</i>

232
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:14,093
Well, that's the last of them,
thank heaven.

233
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:17,322
- What an evening.
- I thought it was a very nice evening.

234
00:17:17,422 --> 00:17:19,494
It may have been for you.

235
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:23,873
It's awful being a woman,
having to dance with a lot of dull men...

236
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,663
laugh at their jokes
while they're treading on your feet.

237
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:29,609
- I didn't tread on your feet.
- You're not dull.

238
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:32,192
- And your jokes are funny.
- Thank you.

239
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,367
- Sibella?
- Mm-hmm?

240
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:38,081
Sibella, will you marry me?

241
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:43,040
Louis, of course not. Do get up.

242
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,028
You may be half Italian,
but even so...

243
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:47,545
you do look silly
playing the stage lover like that.

244
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,018
- Oh, I look silly, do I?
- Yes. Very.

245
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,623
Do I still look silly?

246
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,963
Now, will you marry me?

247
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:09,851
No.

248
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:12,847
- Why not?
- Because I just said I'd marry Lionel.

249
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:17,430
- You can't.
- Why not?

250
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:19,436
Well, he's a clod.
He's not a gentleman.

251
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:21,931
Listen to who's talking.

252
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,234
Whoever heard of a gentleman
blacking the lodger's boots?

253
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,332
That's a wicked thing to say.
Just because Mama was poor.

254
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:30,704
Lionel will be very rich one day.

255
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:34,544
- I might be a duke one day.
- Pigs might fly.

256
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:37,489
No, I might. Really, I might.
You see, Mama was the daughter-

257
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,406
Oh, yes. I know.

258
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:41,326
Well, when you are a duke...

259
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:43,756
you just come and show me your crown,
or whatever it's called...

260
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:46,155
and then I'll feel awfully silly,
won't I?

261
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:47,814
Yes, you will.

262
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:51,145
Anyhow, I'm going to marry Lionel,
and now I'm going to bed.

263
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:56,703
You will.

264
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,473
<i>If there was a precise moment...</i>

265
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:04,356
<i>at which my insubstantial dreaming
took on solid purpose...</i>

266
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,428
<i>that was it.</i>

267
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:09,151
<i>The D'Ascoynes had not only
wronged my mother...</i>

268
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:12,601
<i>they were the obstacle between me
and all that I wanted.</i>

269
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:17,185
<i>The more I thought of them,
these people whom I had studied...</i>

270
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,761
<i>until I knew their names and histories
as well as I knew my own...</i>

271
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:24,093
<i>the more they became monsters
of arrogance and cruelty...</i>

272
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:28,117
<i>whose only function in the world
was to deprive me of my birthright.</i>

273
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:33,754
<i>I had seen Chalfont
only as Mama had painted it.</i>

274
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:41,109
<i>To pass in through
that magnificent gateway...</i>

275
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,730
<i>on visitor's day
at a cost of sixpence...</i>

276
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,719
<i>was a humiliating experience...</i>

277
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:47,986
<i>but I forced myself to undergo it.</i>

278
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,697
<i>I wanted a closer view of the target
at which I had determined to aim.</i>

279
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:58,416
<i>I little expected to catch
a glimpse of the bull's-eye.</i>

280
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:04,367
Excuse me, sir.

281
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:07,779
<i>There were then some eight people
between me and the dukedom...</i>

282
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:10,472
<i>all seemingly equally out of reach.</i>

283
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,810
<i>It is so difficult to make a neatjob
ofkilling people...</i>

284
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,724
<i>with whom one is not
on friendly terms.</i>

285
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,754
<i>I was almost resigned
to its being an impossibility...</i>

286
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,567
<i>when one afternoon, at a moment when
my thoughts were furthest from the subject...</i>

287
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,870
<i>fate took a hand.</i>

288
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:27,837
If you've nothing better,
those will have to do.

289
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:30,277
These London shops
are so far behind Paris.

290
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,513
Parcel them up quickly,
and we'll take them with us.

291
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:35,429
- Charge them to my account.
- Yes, sir. What is the name?

292
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,142
Mr. Ascoyne D'Ascoyne.

293
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:42,973
<i>At last, I was face to face with one of them.</i>

294
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,336
<i>This was the son
of Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, the banker...</i>

295
00:20:46,434 --> 00:20:48,854
<i>whose refusal to help me
towards a more dignified career...</i>

296
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,578
<i>had led to my present
ignominious occupation.</i>

297
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,525
<i>What right had this arrogant puppy...</i>

298
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:57,917
<i>to be standing on the other side
of the counter ordering me about?</i>

299
00:20:58,012 --> 00:21:01,241
<i>In my excitement and anger,
I listened openly to their conversation.</i>

300
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,892
I've booked rooms
at Cruickshanks' at Maidenhead.

301
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,817
We'll go down late
on Friday afternoon.

302
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:07,474
Are you sure it's safe?

303
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:10,610
It's the most discreet place.
In fact, anonymous.

304
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,987
Hey, you. Get on with that parcel,
and never mind what we're talking about.

305
00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:17,331
Don't you dare touch me like that!

306
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,916
I'm not interested
in your idiotic conversation.

307
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,336
If you want to add impertinence
to your eavesdropping...

308
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,409
we'll soon see about that.

309
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:31,460
<i>The upshot was
that I was dismissed on the spot.</i>

310
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:34,023
<i>I decided to repay him in kind...</i>

311
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:37,705
<i>by dismissing him with equal
suddenness from this world.</i>

312
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:41,799
<i>His conversation had told me where I could
probably find the opportunity to kill him.</i>

313
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:45,283
<i>Dr. Hallward's dispensary
had provided me with a means.</i>

314
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:50,215
<i>With the week's wages
I had received in lieu of notice...</i>

315
00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:53,476
<i>I invested in suitable apparel
for a weekend at Maidenhead.</i>

316
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:05,274
<i>It was possible
they might remember me...</i>

317
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,202
<i>but I thought it unlikely...</i>

318
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,298
<i>shop assistants being commonly
regarded as an inferior race...</i>

319
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:13,401
<i>who never emerged
from the other side of the counter.</i>

320
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:19,294
<i>I decided
to take the bull by the horns.</i>

321
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:23,517
Forgive me. I wonder if you could
oblige me with a match.

322
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:26,068
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

323
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:29,816
- Haven't we met before somewhere?
- I don't think so.

324
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,281
Funny, 'cause I could have sworn
I knew your face.

325
00:22:33,274 --> 00:22:35,378
- Were you at Monte last year?
- The year before.

326
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:38,066
Ah, that must be it.
Won't you join me?

327
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,241
Thank you. Not this evening.

328
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:42,197
We are rather tired.

329
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:51,115
<i>I deprecated their retiring so early...</i>

330
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:53,161
<i>but it was hard to blame them...</i>

331
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,721
<i>for weekends, like life, are short.</i>

332
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,817
<i>The next morning,
I waited for them to come down-</i>

333
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,807
<i>and the next afternoon.</i>

334
00:23:04,495 --> 00:23:06,861
<i>They didn't appear the whole day.</i>

335
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:13,770
<i>Nor the morning after.</i>

336
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,660
<i>I no longer felt sentimental.</i>

337
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:33,122
<i>The weekend was nearly over,
and I could hardly expect providence...</i>

338
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,324
<i>to offer me
so promising a chance again.</i>

339
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:38,462
<i>I was in a state of desperation...</i>

340
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:41,376
<i>and I followed them,
hoping for I knew not what.</i>

341
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,327
<i>I had the poison with me, but they
hadn't even taken a picnic basket.</i>

342
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:49,943
<i>It was possible, however, that they might
stop somewhere for refreshment.</i>

343
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:55,314
<i>They did stop shortly afterwards...</i>

344
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:57,306
<i>but not for that.</i>

345
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:01,458
<i>Judging by past experience,
they would be there for hours.</i>

346
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:22,856
<i>The rest followed automatically.</i>

347
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,757
<i>I had fortunately learned to swim
at the Clapham Municipal Baths...</i>

348
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,514
<i>though I never had occasion
to try it underwater.</i>

349
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:33,127
<i>I had no wish to surface
under their noses...</i>

350
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,294
<i>though I doubt if they would have
noticed me even if I had.</i>

351
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:43,370
<i>It was beautifully timed.</i>

352
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,203
<i>I was sorry about the girl...</i>

353
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,944
<i>but found some relief in the reflection that
she had presumably, during the weekend...</i>

354
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:24,694
<i>already undergone
a fate worse than death.</i>

355
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:37,554
<i>I decided to defer consideration
of where and how I should next strike...</i>

356
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:39,857
<i>until my nerves
were thoroughly restored.</i>

357
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:43,057
<i>It must be remembered
that I was very young...</i>

358
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:45,773
<i>and, furthermore,
I am not naturally callous.</i>

359
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:50,445
<i>I suddenly conceived a brilliant idea.</i>

360
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:56,015
<i>I would write a carefully phrased letter
of condolence to old Ascoyne D'Ascoyne.</i>

361
00:25:57,072 --> 00:26:00,648
<i>It would be an agreeable feeling of revenge
for his cruelty to Mama.</i>

362
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:03,945
<i>And, further, it had not failed to occur to me
that there was, at the moment...</i>

363
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,052
<i>a vacancy in the banking house.</i>

364
00:26:07,052 --> 00:26:09,538
<i>Ascoyne D'Ascoyne duly rose to the bait.</i>

365
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:13,959
Please be seated, Mr. Mazzini.

366
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,590
How do you do?

367
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:26,850
My late son.

368
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,703
A great loss.

369
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:34,776
He was young and foolish...

370
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:38,655
but I believe had he been spared
until his maturity-

371
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:41,914
It was my consciousness of that which led me
to presume to tender you my sympathy.

372
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:44,152
I am glad that you did so.

373
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:48,050
A loss so tragic serves to put lesser matters
in their proper perspective.

374
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:51,536
If I remember rightly, Mr. Mazzini...

375
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:55,089
some years ago
I received a communication...

376
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:57,081
<i>from your mother.</i>

377
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:00,086
My late mother.

378
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:09,227
Hello, Louis.
You look very pleased with yourself.

379
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,153
- So do you.
- I have news.

380
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:13,073
- So have I.
- What is it?

381
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,731
No, yours first.

382
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,768
Lionel and I have fixed a date
for our wedding, in two months' time.

383
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:19,696
My congratulations.

384
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:22,660
No, I should congratulate him.
I compliment you.

385
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,636
- Now yours.
- Nothing as exciting as yours.

386
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:29,037
I went today to see Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne,
my cousin, you know.

387
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,619
<i>He has a private banking house
in the city.</i>

388
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:34,058
<i>He offered me employment at once
at five pounds a week...</i>

389
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:36,097
<i>with excellent prospects
for promotion.</i>

390
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:41,348
Louis, I'm so glad for you.

391
00:27:42,824 --> 00:27:46,718
- Louis, do you remember?
- What?

392
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:50,205
Once, in this room...

393
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,764
after my party-

394
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:55,136
- I kissed you.
- Yes.

395
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:57,210
And you were horrible to me.

396
00:27:57,315 --> 00:27:59,224
Yes.

397
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,776
I made fun about you
being related to the D'Ascoynes.

398
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:05,597
I'm sorry.

399
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:07,517
You'll take it more seriously now?

400
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:09,786
Yes.

401
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,990
Louis, kiss me...

402
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:14,972
to show you've forgiven me.

403
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:22,192
No, it would be wrong.
You're pledged to Lionel.

404
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,817
I behaved like a cad that night.

405
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:27,822
I like you when you behave
like a cad.

406
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:37,516
You're a person who must dance
through life, Sibella...

407
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,205
and I hope Lionel won't tread
on your feet too often.

408
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,669
<i>My new employment was humble enough...</i>

409
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:50,248
<i>but I had to test the rungs of the ladder
before I could climb it.</i>

410
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:52,173
- Oh.
- Well -

411
00:28:56,717 --> 00:29:00,164
- That's very nice.
- Oh -

412
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:03,583
<i>The next candidate for
removal seemed to be young Henry D'Ascoyne...</i>

413
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,406
<i>24 years old, recently married...</i>

414
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:08,392
<i>as yet, without issue.</i>

415
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:11,358
<i>I had quite an accumulation by now
of D'Ascoyne data...</i>

416
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:13,503
<i>culled from newspapers
and periodicals...</i>

417
00:29:13,608 --> 00:29:16,192
<i>and I looked through it
for a possible approach to Henry.</i>

418
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:18,595
<i>I found one.</i>

419
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:21,595
<i>I bought the necessary equipment,
secondhand...</i>

420
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,512
<i>and bicycled down
the following weekend.</i>

421
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:27,773
<i>I had studied a couple of photographic
manuals during the week...</i>

422
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:30,590
<i>and found that, in practice,
the mysteries of the camera...</i>

423
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:33,022
<i>demand a little more
than ordinary intelligence...</i>

424
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,828
<i>plus the ability tojudge
the subject upside-down.</i>

425
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:40,089
<i>It was thus, indeed,
that I first saw Henry D'Ascoyne.</i>

426
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:58,029
<i>My method of approach proved
an instantaneous success.</i>

427
00:29:58,134 --> 00:30:01,298
Excuse me.
Isn't that a Thornton Pickard?

428
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,633
Yes. Are you a photographer?

429
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:05,902
Dabble in it.
Got a Sanger Shepherd.

430
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:07,825
- A Sanger Shepherd?
- Nice little camera.

431
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:10,377
Focal plane shutter,
rapid rectilinear and all that.

432
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:13,198
Look here. Why not come up
to my house, and I'll show it to you?

433
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:15,337
Well, I'd be most interested.

434
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:20,204
- My name's D'Ascoyne, by the way.
- Mine is Mazzini.

435
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,757
<i>He seemed a very pleasant fellow...</i>

436
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,513
<i>and I regretted that our acquaintanceship
must be so short.</i>

437
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:28,938
Had one of the potting sheds
fixed up as a darkroom.

438
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,042
Couldn't have suited better
if it had been built for it.

439
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:33,033
Had the equipment
sent down from town.

440
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,476
And I must say the results
have been absolutely top-hole.

441
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,267
I'll show you some quarter-plates
I've taken about the village.

442
00:30:42,438 --> 00:30:45,699
There we are.
Absolutely lightproof, except for this.

443
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:50,334
Everything to hand - developing dishes here,
toning bath here, whole-plate enlarger.

444
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:53,434
- Perfect.
- Not too bad, is it?

445
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:55,904
Talking of the village, by the by,
I don't know if you're thinking...

446
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:58,847
of sending any of your efforts here
to some periodical...

447
00:30:58,943 --> 00:31:00,831
but there's just one thing.

448
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:04,630
I'm sure you're a good fellow,
or I wouldn't like to ask.

449
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:06,556
<i>Ask what?</i>

450
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:10,197
I'd be most grateful if you'd keep back
that last plate you exposed.

451
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,332
<i>- The inn? But it was delightful.
- Yes.</i>

452
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:16,663
The fact is, my wife has views
about such places...

453
00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:18,669
so I never go in them,
you understand?

454
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,848
Naturally, I wouldn't dream
of embarrassing you.

455
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:23,798
I knew you were a good fellow.
Suppose we drink on it?

456
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:29,646
Unless you have views yourself,
of course.

457
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:31,690
<i>- None.
- Splendid.</i>

458
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:34,960
What shall it be?
Sherry? Whiskey?

459
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,400
I think a small developer.

460
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:43,978
<i>The mental picture ofhis
wife that I had formed from Henry's words...</i>

461
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,591
<i>left me unprepared for the charm
of the woman I was to meet.</i>

462
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:51,009
<i>She was as tall and slender as a lily
and as beautiful.</i>

463
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:53,865
My dear, this is Mr. Mazzini.
He has a Thornton Pickard.

464
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:56,516
Mr. Mazzini, my wife.

465
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,855
I'm no photographer myself,
Mr. Mazzini...

466
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:02,116
but I share my husband's pleasure
in welcoming a fellow enthusiast.

467
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:04,998
- You'll take some sherry?
- Well, thank you, I -

468
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:13,691
My husband and I never touch alcohol,
but we see no reason, on that account...

469
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:16,032
<i>to enforce our views on our guests.</i>

470
00:32:16,133 --> 00:32:17,954
Glass of sherry, Harwood.

471
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:19,992
I have some printing frames
out in the sun.

472
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:22,170
If you don't mind,
I'll just run out and see to them.

473
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:26,103
Have you been in the neighborhood long,
Mr. Mazzini?

474
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,094
A few hours only.

475
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:30,012
I was cycling through the village...

476
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,793
and felt compelled to stop
and make a study or two of the inn.

477
00:32:32,894 --> 00:32:35,991
<i>- It looked so charming.
- It does look charming.</i>

478
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:40,118
But I'm afraid it's, by no means, an influence
for good in the lives of our people here.

479
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,106
The landlord
is a former coachman of ours.

480
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,787
I have spoken to him several times about
the amount of drinking that goes on there...

481
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,864
but he continues to allow it.

482
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:49,172
It is, after all, I suppose,
his livelihood.

483
00:32:49,272 --> 00:32:51,410
I do not consider he has the right
to make a livelihood...

484
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,746
by exploiting the weaknesses
of his fellow men.

485
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:57,041
Put as you put it,
it does sound deplorable.

486
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,661
It is deplorable.
Will you excuse me a moment?

487
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:01,999
Harwood.

488
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:04,913
<i>I could well understand
Henry's visits to the village inn...</i>

489
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:07,398
<i>and his stock of refreshments
in the darkroom.</i>

490
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:10,701
<i>Mrs. D'Ascoyne was beautiful,
but what a prig she was.</i>

491
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,377
<i>I wondered how
to ingratiate myself with her...</i>

492
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:17,609
<i>and decided to attack on her own ground
and with her own weapons.</i>

493
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,938
I'm afraid we can offer you
only a simple luncheon, Mr. Mazzini.

494
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:24,351
You are most kind,
but I feel I should not intrude.

495
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,425
- It is no intrusion.
- I'm afraid it is.

496
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,590
- May I explain?
- Please do.

497
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:37,220
It was only when your husband
told me his name...

498
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:40,797
that I realized that I'd come by chance
into the most embarrassing situation.

499
00:33:42,243 --> 00:33:45,374
My mother was a member
of the D'Ascoyne family.

500
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:48,191
She married,
as they thought, beneath her.

501
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,710
And from that day,
they refused to recognize her...

502
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:53,498
or my existence.

503
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,276
I feel that, although in the circumstances
you might hesitate to say so to my face...

504
00:33:57,374 --> 00:34:00,886
you and your husband would prefer
not to receive me at your table.

505
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:05,299
Perhaps you would be good enough
to explain matters to your husband for me.

506
00:34:05,403 --> 00:34:08,152
I shall, naturally,
leave the neighborhood at once.

507
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,065
Mr. Mazzini, please sit down.

508
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,983
Oh.

509
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:18,065
You have exhibited
the most delicate feelings.

510
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,719
I know nothing of the history
to which you refer...

511
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:23,505
but I have often felt that the attitude
of my husband's family...

512
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:25,579
has failed to move with the times -

513
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:28,018
that they think too much
of the rights of nobility...

514
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:30,286
and too little of its duties.

515
00:34:30,387 --> 00:34:34,509
The very honesty of your behavior
would appear to me to prove them wrong.

516
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:37,641
Was Lord Tennyson far from the mark
when he wrote:

517
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:40,132
"Kind hearts are more than coronets...

518
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,205
and simple faith than Norman blood"?

519
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,675
I hope you will stay to luncheon.

520
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:49,601
Oh, in that case,
I shall be delighted and honored.

521
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:52,608
<i>My impersonation
of a man of sterling character...</i>

522
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:54,601
<i>was such a resounding success...</i>

523
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:58,852
<i>that Mrs. D'Ascoyne invited me to spend
the following Saturday-to-Monday with them.</i>

524
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:04,096
<i>When I returned to the somewhat
contrasting atmosphere of Clapham...</i>

525
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:07,644
<i>I found the house in a whirl with preparation
for Sibella's wedding to Lionel...</i>

526
00:35:07,749 --> 00:35:10,169
<i>which was to take place next day.</i>

527
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:13,090
<i>Before going to bed that evening,
I wandered into the old nursery...</i>

528
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:15,073
<i>to fetch a book I'd left there.</i>

529
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:25,660
Penny for them.

530
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,732
Oh, hello, Louis.

531
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:34,450
You're not looking as radiantly happy as young
females in your situation are supposed to look.

532
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:37,815
I was just thinking of all the fun
we've had in this room.

533
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:41,360
- You and I and Graham.
- And Lionel.

534
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:43,952
Yes, and Lionel.

535
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:49,711
Oh, Louis, I don't want to marry Lionel!

536
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:53,773
- Why not?
- He's so dull!

537
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:56,395
I must admit he exhibits the most
extraordinary capacity for middle age...

538
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:59,846
that I've ever encountered
in a young man of 24.

539
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:03,498
However, it's a bit late in the day
to think of that, isn't it?

540
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,666
I know.
That only makes it worse.

541
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:09,613
- I always told you you should marry me.
- I know.

542
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:13,163
That makes it worse too.

543
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,793
You look more lovely today
than I've ever seen you.

544
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:36,291
You're a lucky man, Lionel.
Take my word for it.

545
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,056
<i>I could not help feeling
that even Sibella's capacity for lying...</i>

546
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,616
<i>was going to be taxed to the utmost.</i>

547
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:49,851
<i>Time had brought me revenge
on Lionel.</i>

548
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:51,893
<i>And as the Italian proverb says:</i>

549
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:56,154
<i>"Revenge is a dish which people of taste
prefer to eat cold. "</i>

550
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:01,688
<i>The following Saturday
I left London in the middle of the night...</i>

551
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,153
<i>and reached Henry's house
just before dawn.</i>

552
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,254
<i>It took a mere three minutes
to substitute petrol...</i>

553
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:13,292
<i>for the paraffin
in the darkroom lamp.</i>

554
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,983
<i>And I then repaired to a meadow
and took a few hours'sleep...</i>

555
00:37:16,086 --> 00:37:19,150
<i>while awaiting the hour at which
I could reasonably arrive at the house.</i>

556
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,692
<i>The day dragged by
in an agony of suspense for me.</i>

557
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:26,957
<i>Henry took photograph
after photograph...</i>

558
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:30,765
<i>but seemed to have no urge whatever
to follow it up with a visit to the darkroom.</i>

559
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:35,594
Bravo, Edith!

560
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:38,693
<i>I began to fear
that he had suddenly taken the pledge.</i>

561
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,067
I think I'll just go and develop these
before tea. Care to come?

562
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:46,854
I would, indeed, but I have
a slight headache - the sun, I think.

563
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:49,289
And I'm afraid the chemicals
wouldn't improve it.

564
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:51,872
Mr. Mazzini and I will have tea
under the tulip tree.

565
00:37:51,976 --> 00:37:54,311
I've always found that
most beneficial for a headache.

566
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:56,828
I'm afraid Henry
will think me a poor enthusiast.

567
00:37:56,934 --> 00:38:00,098
I sometimes think
that he is too great a one.

568
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:02,084
In a way, I am to blame for it.

569
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,732
Before we were married,
he had few interests.

570
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:06,810
He used to spend the greater part
of each day at his club.

571
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:12,471
<i>I felt that such a life was unhealthy and
persuaded him to live here in the country.</i>

572
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:17,309
I hoped that perhaps he would interest himself
in the welfare of our tenantry, as I do.

573
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:20,309
<i>But he became interested in photography
on our honeymoon...</i>

574
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:23,761
and since then it has become
the major preoccupation of his life.

575
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:28,025
<i>- Mr. Mazzini.
- Yes.</i>

576
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:30,610
<i>I hope you will forgive my speaking to you
on a personal matter...</i>

577
00:38:30,715 --> 00:38:33,648
but it worries me that Henry
should spend so much time on his hobby...

578
00:38:33,753 --> 00:38:35,824
that he has little left
for any more useful activity.

579
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:38,644
<i>Am I right to let him
go on like this?</i>

580
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:41,296
<i>I could hardly point out
that Henry now had no time left...</i>

581
00:38:41,398 --> 00:38:43,219
<i>for any kind of activity...</i>

582
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:45,705
<i>so I continued
to discuss his future.</i>

583
00:38:45,813 --> 00:38:47,885
He has never shown any wish
for a career in politics?

584
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:50,889
<i>- None.
- Nor any other ambitions?</i>

585
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,440
One only- to win a prize
at the Salon Photography in Brussels.

586
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:57,286
What is it?

587
00:38:57,392 --> 00:39:00,970
They're just burning some leaves
at the bottom of the garden.

588
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,437
But they can't be at this time of year.

589
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:08,193
- Henry!
- No. You stay here.

590
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,404
<i>Needless to say, I was too late.</i>

591
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:15,039
<i>The funeral service was held
in the village church at Chalfont...</i>

592
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,152
<i>prior to interment in the family vault.</i>

593
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:21,794
<i>Mrs. D'Ascoyne,
who had discerned in me...</i>

594
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:24,741
<i>a man of delicate sensibility
and high purpose...</i>

595
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:27,707
<i>asked me to accompany her
on the cross-countryjourney.</i>

596
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:30,429
"To everything there is a season...

597
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:33,912
"and a time to every purpose
under the heaven.

598
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:38,490
A time to be born, and a time to die. "

599
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:41,789
<i>The occasion
was interesting in that it provided me...</i>

600
00:39:41,888 --> 00:39:44,886
<i>with my first sight
of the D'Ascoynes en masse.</i>

601
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:47,356
<i>Interesting and somewhat depressing...</i>

602
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:50,900
<i>for it emphasized
how far I had yet to travel.</i>

603
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,891
<i>There was the duke.</i>

604
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:59,224
<i>There was my employer,
Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne.</i>

605
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:03,637
<i>There was
Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne.</i>

606
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:09,006
<i>There was
General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne.</i>

607
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:14,894
<i>There was Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne.</i>

608
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,817
Shh!

609
00:40:18,803 --> 00:40:22,414
<i>And in the pulpit,
talking interminable nonsense...</i>

610
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:24,455
<i>the Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne.</i>

611
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:28,487
The life cut short was one...

612
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:31,656
rich in achievement and promise...

613
00:40:31,758 --> 00:40:34,124
<i>of service to humanity.</i>

614
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:36,707
<i>The D'Ascoynes
certainly appeared to have accorded...</i>

615
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:38,818
<i>with the tradition
of the landed gentry...</i>

616
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:41,922
<i>and sent the fool of the family
into the church.</i>

617
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,766
Well, good-bye, my dear.

618
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:49,059
- Good-bye.
- No fretting now.

619
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:52,005
After all, one thing to be said -
we all have to come to it.

620
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:57,186
Great thing, you know, family vault like ours.
Constant reminder of one's heritage.

621
00:40:57,284 --> 00:40:59,323
Now, take this new cremation nonsense.

622
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:02,525
Who wants to see his nearest and dearest
put in an incinerator?

623
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,528
I think, sir, Mrs. D'Ascoyne should leave.
The wind is turning cold.

624
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:07,836
As Mrs. D'Ascoyne thinks best.

625
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,896
Glad we had Cousin Henry
to take the service.

626
00:41:11,998 --> 00:41:15,772
Boring old ass,
but it keeps the thing in the family.

627
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,909
People getting strange ideas these days.

628
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:19,954
Had a fellow write to me
not so long ago...

629
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,907
wanted to bury his mother here
from Tooting or somewhere.

630
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:25,783
Start letting strangers in,
the place will be full up.

631
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:28,117
No room for us, eh?

632
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:31,281
<i>I privately promised him
that I would make it my business...</i>

633
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:33,237
<i>to see there was room for him.</i>

634
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:41,197
Uncle Ethelred
is not the most tactful of men.

635
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,241
I could gladly have struck him.

636
00:41:43,348 --> 00:41:45,518
Thank you for intervening
when you did.

637
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:50,985
The house will be so empty...

638
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:53,454
and yet he will be in it everywhere.

639
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:57,701
I find the thought of life there
hard to face.

640
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,139
Must you stay there?
A new environment -

641
00:42:00,236 --> 00:42:02,091
I must...

642
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:04,010
for one reason if no other.

643
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:07,588
They would say I was running away,
that there was truth in all these rumors.

644
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,005
<i>- Rumors?
- In the village.</i>

645
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,381
<i>There's been gossip.</i>

646
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,327
<i>They say that Henry drank in secret.</i>

647
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:19,812
They even say that
that was the cause of the accident.

648
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,131
I'm sure that Henry would never have
professed one thing and practiced another.

649
00:42:25,572 --> 00:42:27,394
I, too, am sure.

650
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:30,785
Otherwise,
I think I could not survive.

651
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,590
We have a long way to go.
Try to sleep a little.

652
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:37,055
Sleep does not come easily.

653
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:39,768
Please try.

654
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,692
Allow me.

655
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:46,900
<i>I was conscious that a new obsession...</i>

656
00:42:47,004 --> 00:42:50,996
<i>was about tojoin the one that I should wear
the coronet of the duke of Chalfont-</i>

657
00:42:51,098 --> 00:42:54,774
<i>that Edith D'Ascoyne should wear that
of the duchess beside me.</i>

658
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:58,736
<i>Her dignity ofbearing
at the worst moments ofher grief...</i>

659
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,943
<i>had impressed me with the feeling
that here was a woman...</i>

660
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:03,914
<i>whose quality matched her beauty.</i>

661
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:06,257
<i>I resolved to embark
upon her courtship...</i>

662
00:43:06,357 --> 00:43:09,138
<i>as soon as a decent period of mourning
should have elapsed.</i>

663
00:43:10,898 --> 00:43:14,672
<i>Sibella? Yes, Sibella was pretty enough
in her suburban way.</i>

664
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,697
<i>And, indeed, there was no reason why we
shouldn't continue to meet on friendly terms.</i>

665
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:22,115
<i>But her face would have looked
rather out of place under a coronet.</i>

666
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:27,660
That, sir, is a list of bills
due for redemption this week.

667
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:30,145
I've marked in red
those asking for renewal.

668
00:43:30,253 --> 00:43:34,145
Aitcheson, yes.
Pole and Carter, I suppose so.

669
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:36,421
Knollis Limited, oh, no.

670
00:43:36,522 --> 00:43:38,343
Redbank and Holland -

671
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:40,328
You have a friend there,
have you not?

672
00:43:40,425 --> 00:43:43,074
An acquaintance.
I know Lionel Holland.

673
00:43:43,174 --> 00:43:45,378
Would you say that he's sound?

674
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:47,365
I wouldn't say not, sir.

675
00:43:47,462 --> 00:43:49,283
Hmm. Thank you.

676
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:57,080
- Mazzini.
- Yes, sir?

677
00:43:57,187 --> 00:44:00,055
I've watched your progress here
with great care...

678
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:03,476
and have been gratified to note
that it has fully justified my judgment...

679
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,722
in inviting you into the firm.

680
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:09,848
In view of that, and in order that you
may be able to adopt a style of living...

681
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,850
befitting a member
of the D'Ascoyne family...

682
00:44:12,957 --> 00:44:16,152
I have decided to appoint you
my private secretary...

683
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:18,901
at a salary of L500 per annum.

684
00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:23,026
- Sir, I cannot begin to -
- Oh, please do not try.

685
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:26,291
I had intended that my son
should occupy the position.

686
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:31,253
I can only say that I will try
to make my occupancy of it...

687
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:33,235
worthy of his memory.

688
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:38,419
<i>I left the Hallwards'house...</i>

689
00:44:38,514 --> 00:44:41,197
<i>and took a bachelor apartment
in St. James's.</i>

690
00:44:41,298 --> 00:44:43,751
<i>Clapham no longer held
Sibella's presence to compensate me...</i>

691
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:46,539
<i>for the tedious journey
between the suburbs and the city.</i>

692
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:52,330
<i>Anyhow, it would be vastly more
convenient for her to visit me here.</i>

693
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:08,800
Now, let me have a look
at the beautiful Mrs. Holland.

694
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:11,838
- No, I think I prefer Miss Hallward.
- So do I.

695
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:16,290
Louis, it's very wrong of me
to visit you here.

696
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:19,552
- Why?
- A married woman calling on a bachelor?

697
00:45:20,643 --> 00:45:23,009
A dangerous bachelor...

698
00:45:23,108 --> 00:45:24,928
in his apartment.

699
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:26,848
I? Dangerous?

700
00:45:29,121 --> 00:45:31,705
These things only become wrong
when people know about them.

701
00:45:31,807 --> 00:45:34,523
This is a very discreet apartment.
That's why I chose it.

702
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:37,469
So that young women
could call on you in safety?

703
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:40,916
So that one young woman could.

704
00:45:42,396 --> 00:45:44,599
How did you know she'd want to?

705
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:46,519
I hoped.

706
00:45:49,657 --> 00:45:52,525
- How did you enjoy your honeymoon?
- Not at all.

707
00:45:53,816 --> 00:45:56,367
Not at all?

708
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,292
Not at all.

709
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:02,637
- And how was Italy?
- Oh, impossible!

710
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,772
Every time I wanted to go shopping,
Lionel dragged me off to a church...

711
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,696
or picture gallery.

712
00:46:07,794 --> 00:46:11,022
- Said he wanted to improve his mind.
- He has room to do so.

713
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:14,949
I should reprove you
for saying unkind things about him...

714
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:16,876
but I can't.

715
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:22,434
Louis, I think I've married
the most boring man in London.

716
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:24,428
- In England.
- In Europe!

717
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,943
Oh, the Italian men
are so handsome...

718
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,910
but I could never get away
from Lionel for a moment.

719
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:39,331
But I was forgetting -you're Italian.

720
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,252
Half.

721
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:48,733
Louis...

722
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:51,517
I can speak frankly to you.

723
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:54,976
Well, if not to me, to whom?

724
00:46:56,001 --> 00:46:58,006
I shall go mad.

725
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:01,176
Already when he touches me,
I want to scream.

726
00:47:15,322 --> 00:47:17,209
What am I doing?

727
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,342
You know very well.

728
00:47:20,439 --> 00:47:22,741
You're playing with fire.

729
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:24,660
At least it warms me.

730
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:27,922
I must go.

731
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,530
Lionel's dining at home tonight.

732
00:47:31,635 --> 00:47:33,544
Where is Lionel dining tomorrow night?

733
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,854
With some business acquaintances.

734
00:47:36,946 --> 00:47:39,115
And where are you dining
tomorrow night?

735
00:47:39,217 --> 00:47:40,906
Here?

736
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:42,829
Here.

737
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:50,181
<i>Poor little imprisoned bird.</i>

738
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:54,080
<i>Well, she was welcome to come
and flutter her wings with me.</i>

739
00:47:54,187 --> 00:47:56,641
<i>I could think of many more
disagreeable ways ofkilling time...</i>

740
00:47:56,747 --> 00:47:58,655
<i>pending the arrival of the moment...</i>

741
00:47:58,762 --> 00:48:00,647
<i>when the conventional decencies
would permit me...</i>

742
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,882
<i>to make my declaration to Edith.</i>

743
00:48:03,878 --> 00:48:07,293
<i>As to the other undertaking,
I had not forgotten or forgiven...</i>

744
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:10,299
<i>the boredom of the sermon
at young Henry's funeral...</i>

745
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:13,022
<i>and I decided to promote
the Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne...</i>

746
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,010
<i>to next place on the list.</i>

747
00:48:15,107 --> 00:48:17,660
<i>I therefore assumed
the garb and character...</i>

748
00:48:17,763 --> 00:48:20,445
<i>of a colonial bishop
spending his vacation...</i>

749
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:23,228
<i>making a collection ofbrass rubbings
from country churches.</i>

750
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:28,471
Good evening, my lord.

751
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:32,730
<i>It was, for a moment,
a shock to be addressed by my ecclesiastical title...</i>

752
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,650
<i>but I recovered quickly.</i>

753
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:38,489
Good evening. I was just taking a rubbing
of this most interesting brass.

754
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:42,197
An ancestress of my dear late wife.

755
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:44,751
Allow me to introduce myself.

756
00:48:44,856 --> 00:48:48,467
Henry D'Ascoyne,
rector of this parish.

757
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:51,860
Septimus Wilkinson,
bishop of Matabeleland.

758
00:48:53,237 --> 00:48:57,709
I was spending my vacation taking a cycling
tour around your beautiful country churches.

759
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:02,153
- Ah! Have you noticed our clerestory?
- Cle -

760
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:06,031
Ah, exquisite!

761
00:49:06,129 --> 00:49:09,062
- The corbels are very fine.
- Hmm.

762
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:12,810
Perhaps Your Lordship would permit me
to show you one or two other things...

763
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,852
in which we take a pride.

764
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:16,844
I should be most interested.

765
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:19,722
Our most notable features,
of course...

766
00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:23,113
are the D'Ascoyne memorials.

767
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,828
Every member of the family...

768
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:29,506
to a cadet branch
of which I have the honor to belong...

769
00:49:29,608 --> 00:49:33,250
is buried here in the family vault.

770
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:39,931
Here you will see
the first duke and his duchess.

771
00:49:41,806 --> 00:49:45,634
The dead watching, as it were,
over the living.

772
00:49:47,116 --> 00:49:49,985
The church is exceptionally
endowed also...

773
00:49:50,092 --> 00:49:53,635
with items of architectural interest.

774
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:57,855
You will note that our chantry...

775
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,887
displays the crocketed
and finialed ogee...

776
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:06,048
which marks it
as very early perpendicular.

777
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:10,528
The bosses to the pendant
are typical.

778
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,207
And I always say...

779
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:17,850
that my west window...

780
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:21,301
has all the exuberance of Chaucer...

781
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:24,124
without, happily...

782
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,417
any of the concomitant crudities
of his period.

783
00:50:27,518 --> 00:50:29,077
Hmm.

784
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,220
Now we approach the font.

785
00:50:32,443 --> 00:50:35,311
<i>At last he did
as I had hoped and invited me to dinner.</i>

786
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:38,766
<i>The Reverend Lord Henry was not
one of those newfangled parsons...</i>

787
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:42,582
<i>who carry the principles of their vocation
uncomfortably into private life.</i>

788
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:44,881
<i>However,
he exhibited a polite interest...</i>

789
00:50:44,982 --> 00:50:47,371
<i>in the progress of the Christian faith
in Matabeleland...</i>

790
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,615
<i>which I was at some difficulty
to satisfy.</i>

791
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:51,821
The S.P.C.K. have provided us...

792
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,738
with a large number of copies
of the good book...

793
00:50:54,836 --> 00:50:56,939
translated into Matabele.

794
00:50:57,042 --> 00:51:00,074
But as none of the natives can read
even their own language -

795
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:04,071
- You speak Matabele yourself?
- Not as a native.

796
00:51:04,176 --> 00:51:07,174
It would be most interesting...

797
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:10,277
to hear a sample of the language.

798
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,064
I'm afraid my Matabele
is a little rusty.

799
00:51:13,164 --> 00:51:15,814
Oh, come, my lord.

800
00:51:17,323 --> 00:51:22,243
Daniel cast into the lions' den,
for example.

801
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:30,561
Daniel -

802
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:35,547
<i>It is a colloquial rendering, of course.</i>

803
00:51:36,547 --> 00:51:38,434
Most interesting.

804
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:42,327
My lord, the port is with you.

805
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,255
Oh.

806
00:51:46,944 --> 00:51:50,204
- How do you find the wine?
- Admirable.

807
00:51:50,303 --> 00:51:52,855
- Cockburn '69.
- Oh.

808
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,291
No finer year,
in my view.

809
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:01,812
My doctor, though,
is of a different opinion.

810
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:03,801
<i>And what does he favor?</i>

811
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:08,497
<i>Abstinence.</i>

812
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:11,889
Would you care for a cigar?

813
00:52:13,014 --> 00:52:14,901
Thank you.

814
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:42,537
Yes.

815
00:52:43,884 --> 00:52:48,966
He's continually warning me
about the state of my arteries.

816
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,126
But I say to him...

817
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,577
"What possible harm can there be...

818
00:52:59,685 --> 00:53:02,140
"in one glass of an evening...

819
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,761
or even two?"

820
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,746
What harm, indeed.

821
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,536
- You do not condemn me then?
- Not in the least.

822
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,212
If I may say so...

823
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,628
without disrespect to my superiors...

824
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:24,344
your visit has
brought me something...

825
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:29,364
which I could not expect
from any churchman in this country.

826
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:03,720
<i>I surmised, correctly, as it proved...</i>

827
00:54:03,822 --> 00:54:07,650
<i>that Lord Henry's doctor would assume
that he had succumbed to a surfeit of port...</i>

828
00:54:07,756 --> 00:54:10,603
<i>and would politely ascribe
death to a heart attack.</i>

829
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:13,894
<i>On my return to London,
I decided to proceed methodically...</i>

830
00:54:13,993 --> 00:54:16,841
<i>with the elimination of
the remaining minor obstacles.</i>

831
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:21,604
<i>Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne was a pioneer
in the campaign for women's suffrage.</i>

832
00:54:27,588 --> 00:54:30,076
<i>With the inconvenient consequence
that her public appearances...</i>

833
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,952
<i>were invariably made under
the watchful eyes of the metropolitan police.</i>

834
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:36,155
<i>When she was not making
public appearances...</i>

835
00:54:36,257 --> 00:54:38,973
<i>she was in prison
and still more inaccessible.</i>

836
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:42,333
<i>- In fact, before I could learn
of a favorable opportunity-</i>

837
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,278
<i>I had tojoin the movement myself.</i>

838
00:54:45,374 --> 00:54:47,545
<i>Secret plans had been made
for Lady Agatha...</i>

839
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:49,716
<i>to celebrate her latest
release from Holloway...</i>

840
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:52,852
<i>by a shower ofleaflets over
Whitehall and the West End.</i>

841
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:54,809
<i>Anchor.</i>

842
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:26,825
<i>I shot an arrow in the air...</i>

843
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:30,060
<i>she fell to Earth
in Berkeley Square.</i>

844
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:35,584
<i>Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne
presented a more difficult problem.</i>

845
00:55:36,651 --> 00:55:38,560
<i>He scarcely ever set foot ashore...</i>

846
00:55:40,106 --> 00:55:44,099
<i>and I was beginning to feel that this task
was beyond even my ingenuity...</i>

847
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:50,049
<i>when he was conveniently
involved in a naval disaster...</i>

848
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,637
<i>which arose from a combination
of natural obstinacy...</i>

849
00:55:52,742 --> 00:55:55,042
<i>and a certain confusion of mind-</i>

850
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,962
<i>unfortunate in one ofhis rank.</i>

851
00:55:58,244 --> 00:56:00,130
Bring her to port.

852
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:05,119
- Surely you mean starboard, sir.
- Port!

853
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:16,218
<i>Both ships sank almost immediately...</i>

854
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:18,650
<i>though, fortunately,
all hands were saved-</i>

855
00:56:18,748 --> 00:56:20,634
<i>save one.</i>

856
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:24,435
<i>Admiral Lord Horatio,
obstinate to the last...</i>

857
00:56:24,538 --> 00:56:26,904
<i>insisted on going down
with his ship.</i>

858
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:34,131
<i>General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne,
on the other hand...</i>

859
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,433
<i>who never tired of demonstrating
how he had fought...</i>

860
00:56:36,533 --> 00:56:38,988
<i>the most calamitous campaign
of the South African War...</i>

861
00:56:39,092 --> 00:56:40,914
<i>was a fairly easy proposition.</i>

862
00:56:41,012 --> 00:56:43,858
At that moment,
the concealed enemy...

863
00:56:43,955 --> 00:56:47,499
emerged from behind the kopje.

864
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:52,236
I held our guns' fire until
we could see the whites of their eyes.

865
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:56,132
Then I gave the order. "Fire!"

866
00:56:56,238 --> 00:56:58,059
Boom, boom, boom.

867
00:56:59,117 --> 00:57:02,411
<i>It seemed appropriate
that he who had lived amidst the cannon's roar...</i>

868
00:57:02,507 --> 00:57:04,514
<i>should die explosively.</i>

869
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:07,039
<i>I therefore concealed
in a pot of caviar...</i>

870
00:57:07,145 --> 00:57:10,145
<i>a simple but powerful
homemade bomb...</i>

871
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:13,728
<i>and through the post,
I sent the caviar to the general.</i>

872
00:57:13,831 --> 00:57:16,352
<i>I pretended to be deceived by the feint...</i>

873
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:18,558
<i>and sent our horse to meet it.</i>

874
00:57:18,661 --> 00:57:24,159
<i>At that moment, the concealed enemy
emerged from behind the kopje.</i>

875
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,332
I held our guns' fire...

876
00:57:26,436 --> 00:57:29,151
till we could see
the whites of their eyes.

877
00:57:34,337 --> 00:57:37,597
Used to get a lot of this stuff
in the Crimea.

878
00:57:37,696 --> 00:57:40,727
One thing the Russkies do really well.

879
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:46,037
<i>Not an atom ofhim was left.</i>

880
00:57:49,563 --> 00:57:54,198
One could almost believe there was a curse
on our unfortunate family, Mazzini.

881
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:56,119
Indeed, sir, one could.

882
00:57:56,216 --> 00:57:58,735
I don't know if you realize
how close this series of tragedies...

883
00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:01,009
has brought you
to the succession.

884
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,753
- I had not actually given the matter any thought, sir.
- Then it's time that you did.

885
00:58:04,853 --> 00:58:08,234
Do you not realize that you are
heir presumptive to the dukedom?

886
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,240
That is to say, in the event of
the present duke dying without issue...

887
00:58:11,346 --> 00:58:14,192
I alone intervene
between you and the title.

888
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,809
And I am an old man.

889
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:19,780
I have never really recovered from
the first of these calamities.

890
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:22,439
You mean I might become
duke of Chalfont?

891
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,550
<i>I mean that you almost
certainly will.</i>

892
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,876
In view of that,
I feel it would be more fitting...

893
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,240
that you should cease to be
an employee here -

894
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:34,654
- Oh.
- and become instead my partner.

895
00:58:35,689 --> 00:58:37,510
I am most deeply grateful and honored.

896
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:41,633
If you'll come round here,
I will make everything very clear to you.

897
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:55,999
Uh, had she lived, your mother, of course,
would have succeeded before you.

898
00:58:56,098 --> 00:58:57,919
<i>One of my first tasks as partner...</i>

899
00:58:58,018 --> 00:59:00,220
<i>was to interview Lionel,
who came cap-</i>

900
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:02,524
<i>or rather,
silk hat in hand.</i>

901
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:08,253
To save time, I presume you have called
to ask the renewal of your bill?

902
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,357
The fact is, old boy,
we sold short...

903
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:13,329
and the market hasn't
dropped as we expected.

904
00:59:13,435 --> 00:59:16,184
I feel entitled
to point out that we here...

905
00:59:16,283 --> 00:59:19,795
regard our function as the encouragement
of constructive investment...

906
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:23,125
and not the financing
of mere gambling transactions.

907
00:59:23,224 --> 00:59:25,045
Ah -

908
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:27,662
<i>It would have delighted me to refuse him.</i>

909
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:29,970
<i>However, a bankrupt Lionel
could hardly have continued...</i>

910
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,490
<i>to support Sibella
in her extravagances...</i>

911
00:59:32,596 --> 00:59:34,538
<i>and I had no wish
to do so myself.</i>

912
00:59:34,643 --> 00:59:39,247
Very well. We will renew...
at three and a half percent.

913
00:59:39,346 --> 00:59:42,159
<i>I judged that
the time was now ripe to make a move...</i>

914
00:59:42,256 --> 00:59:44,078
<i>in the matter
of Edith D'Ascoyne.</i>

915
00:59:44,175 --> 00:59:46,793
It's becoming cold.
Shall we go in?

916
00:59:46,895 --> 00:59:49,000
I know why you shivered just now.

917
00:59:49,103 --> 00:59:51,339
It was not because
you were cold.

918
00:59:51,438 --> 00:59:53,640
No.

919
00:59:53,741 --> 00:59:55,780
I couldn't help remembering.

920
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:59,363
I know.
But do you try to forget?

921
00:59:59,468 --> 01:00:02,400
- I may sound harsh, but believe me -
- Please.

922
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:05,288
Not there.

923
01:00:06,919 --> 01:00:09,058
Because it was Henry's chair.

924
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,330
It hasn't been used since that day.

925
01:00:12,326 --> 01:00:14,213
Nothing of his.

926
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:17,276
Everything is just as he left it -
his writing desk, his clothes.

927
01:00:18,724 --> 01:00:20,992
I cannot bear that
it should be otherwise.

928
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,823
You want this house to be a shrine.

929
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:29,564
You're wrong.
Shrines are not meant to house the living.

930
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:34,715
I have always respected you -
your principles, your courage -

931
01:00:34,813 --> 01:00:36,668
above any woman I've ever met.

932
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,787
It is your duty
to yourself and to others -

933
01:00:40,892 --> 01:00:42,931
to Henry even -

934
01:00:43,035 --> 01:00:46,416
to live again
in the present, in the future.

935
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,342
What future is there for me?

936
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,968
I am now going to say
something presumptuous.

937
01:00:58,068 --> 01:01:00,686
You must order me
from your house if you wish.

938
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:03,177
It is this:

939
01:01:03,283 --> 01:01:07,144
If you should ever feel that
the constant support of a devoted admirer...

940
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,704
would be of assistance to you...

941
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:12,678
I should be most honored
if you would permit me to...

942
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:14,606
offer you my hand in marriage.

943
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:18,861
Mr. Mazzini.

944
01:01:25,163 --> 01:01:27,137
This is a shock.

945
01:01:28,777 --> 01:01:31,363
I'm most touched.

946
01:01:31,465 --> 01:01:33,536
Most grateful, but...

947
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,540
I could not consider
even the possibility of remarrying.

948
01:01:38,438 --> 01:01:41,535
I have spoken too boldly
and too soon.

949
01:01:43,109 --> 01:01:46,850
Please regard what I have said merely
as something to draw upon...

950
01:01:46,947 --> 01:01:49,151
should you ever feel so inclined.

951
01:01:49,442 --> 01:01:51,961
<i>Sibella was waiting for me when I got back.</i>

952
01:01:52,065 --> 01:01:54,715
<i>I was pleased to see her,
for while I never admired Edith...</i>

953
01:01:54,817 --> 01:01:56,823
<i>as much as when
I was with Sibella...</i>

954
01:01:56,927 --> 01:01:59,894
<i>I never longed for Sibella
as much as when I was with Edith.</i>

955
01:02:01,982 --> 01:02:04,436
<i>I'm afraid I'm late.
Have you been bored?</i>

956
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,362
No.

957
01:02:06,459 --> 01:02:09,175
I've been looking into the fire
and thinking.

958
01:02:09,275 --> 01:02:11,216
- What about?
- Oh.

959
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:14,256
How we used to roast chestnuts
round the other fire...

960
01:02:14,362 --> 01:02:16,630
and what a lot has happened since.

961
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,550
Such as?

962
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:22,421
How you told me not to marry Lionel
because you might be a duke one day...

963
01:02:22,517 --> 01:02:25,135
and how I laughed at you.

964
01:02:25,237 --> 01:02:27,603
And how I married Lionel.

965
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,968
And now you really nearly are a duke.

966
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,385
We're much better off
as we are, you and I.

967
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:37,166
It's all very well for you to say that.
You're not married to Lionel.

968
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,232
We see each other
when we want to.

969
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:42,506
We're not obliged to see each other
when we don't want to.

970
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:45,541
We don't see each other
as often as I'd like to.

971
01:02:45,645 --> 01:02:48,262
- You've been away the whole weekend.
- I had to go.

972
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:50,752
- Where?
- To see Mrs. D'Ascoyne...

973
01:02:50,859 --> 01:02:53,346
the widow of that cousin
of mine who was killed.

974
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:56,417
All your cousins seem to get killed.

975
01:02:56,522 --> 01:03:00,295
I really wouldn't be in the least surprised
if you'd murdered them all.

976
01:03:00,392 --> 01:03:02,596
<i>- Oh.
- How clumsy of me.</i>

977
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:17,344
- Whatever made you say that?
- Just silliness.

978
01:03:18,338 --> 01:03:21,565
Well, if you promise not to tell anyone,
I'll let you in to my guilty secret.

979
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,118
I did murder them all.

980
01:03:24,224 --> 01:03:26,644
I've suspected it
for a long time.

981
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,811
- What's she like?
- Who?

982
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:34,193
- Mrs. D'Ascoyne.
- Oh, she's, uh, tall, slender-

983
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,594
- Beautiful?
- Yes, I suppose some people would call her beautiful.

984
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:41,038
- Would you?
- I suppose so. I never really thought about that.

985
01:03:42,328 --> 01:03:45,622
What would you say
if she asked you about me?

986
01:03:53,813 --> 01:03:57,423
I'd say that you were
a perfect combination of imperfections.

987
01:03:57,523 --> 01:04:01,099
I'd say that your nose
was just a little too short...

988
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:04,070
your mouth just a little too wide...

989
01:04:04,176 --> 01:04:06,893
but that yours was a face
that a man could see in his dreams...

990
01:04:06,992 --> 01:04:09,130
for the whole of his life.

991
01:04:09,232 --> 01:04:12,841
I'd say that you were vain, selfish...

992
01:04:12,942 --> 01:04:15,690
cruel, deceitful.

993
01:04:17,164 --> 01:04:19,847
I'd say that you were adorable.

994
01:04:19,947 --> 01:04:23,011
I'd say that you were... Sibella.

995
01:04:24,105 --> 01:04:26,144
What a pretty speech.

996
01:04:26,249 --> 01:04:28,517
I mean it.

997
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:30,688
Come and say it to me again.

998
01:04:35,494 --> 01:04:38,078
I'd say your nose
was just a little too short...

999
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:42,815
and your mouth -yes, your mouth -
just a little too wide.

1000
01:04:49,537 --> 01:04:53,080
<i>Shortly afterwards, my employer had a stroke.</i>

1001
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:55,004
<i>There was little
that could be done...</i>

1002
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:57,883
<i>and the doctor gave him a month,
at the most, to live.</i>

1003
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,500
<i>I was glad,
after all his kindness to me...</i>

1004
01:05:00,603 --> 01:05:02,904
<i>that I should not
have to kill the old man.</i>

1005
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:06,134
<i>Soon the only obstacle
between me and my inheritance...</i>

1006
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:08,372
<i>would be the duke himself.</i>

1007
01:05:08,474 --> 01:05:10,611
<i>I could lay no plan
for disposing ofhim...</i>

1008
01:05:10,712 --> 01:05:14,485
<i>as the life he led within those great
stone walls was a closed book to me.</i>

1009
01:05:14,582 --> 01:05:17,549
<i>I was gloomily examining
the problem for the hundredth time...</i>

1010
01:05:17,654 --> 01:05:21,199
<i>as I awaited one day the expected arrival
of Sibella at my apartments.</i>

1011
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:31,178
<i>- Good afternoon, Mr. Mazzini.
- Mrs. D'Ascoyne.!</i>

1012
01:05:31,281 --> 01:05:33,167
I was passing
through St. James's...

1013
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,849
and thought I would take
the opportunity to call on you.

1014
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:41,865
Was that wise?
Discreet, I mean?

1015
01:05:41,965 --> 01:05:45,259
There are some conventions which must be
governed by individual circumstance.

1016
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:48,321
Surely it is safe for a woman
to visit a man of your reputation.

1017
01:05:48,427 --> 01:05:50,433
It is of your reputation
that I'm thinking.

1018
01:05:50,538 --> 01:05:53,537
Without being inhospitable, I would be
happier if your visit were not a long one.

1019
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,356
I appreciate the scrupulousness
of your motives.

1020
01:05:56,455 --> 01:05:59,619
- I have, anyhow, only one important matter to speak of.
- That is?

1021
01:05:59,718 --> 01:06:03,100
I have thought a great deal about
what you said at our last meeting...

1022
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,782
and I have tried to think
what Henry's wishes would be.

1023
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:10,364
I remember he said to me once...

1024
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,629
"You have too much good in you, Edith,
for one man.

1025
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:16,695
I sometimes wish that others
could have a share of it. "

1026
01:06:18,816 --> 01:06:20,855
I have reconsidered
the offer you made to me...

1027
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:23,577
thank you again for it,
and accept it glady.

1028
01:06:24,637 --> 01:06:26,676
You rob me of words.

1029
01:06:26,779 --> 01:06:29,975
<i>I think, however, we should make
no announcement for three months, at least.</i>

1030
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,793
As you think best.

1031
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:34,711
In these, uh, new circumstances...

1032
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:36,881
I think it more than ever desirable
that your unconventional...

1033
01:06:36,984 --> 01:06:39,602
though in its purpose delightful,
visit should be cut short.

1034
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:44,524
If your attention as a husband is equal
of your consideration as a friend...

1035
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:47,280
I shall have made
a most fortunate decision.

1036
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:57,453
Do you not think, though, that perhaps
Uncle Ethelred, as head of the family...

1037
01:06:57,553 --> 01:06:59,374
should be told at once?

1038
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,116
Perhaps so.
Yes, I'll write to him.

1039
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:05,070
Good-bye, Louis.

1040
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:07,052
Good-bye, Edith.

1041
01:07:08,716 --> 01:07:11,433
You leave behind you
the happiest man in London.

1042
01:07:19,177 --> 01:07:21,118
<i>This was not a piece of news...</i>

1043
01:07:21,223 --> 01:07:23,362
<i>which I was looking forward
to breaking to Sibella.</i>

1044
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:26,180
<i>She had no rights in the matter...</i>

1045
01:07:26,279 --> 01:07:29,691
<i>but women have a disconcerting ability
to make scenes out of nothing...</i>

1046
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:33,179
<i>and to prove themselves injured
when they themselves are at fault.</i>

1047
01:07:35,203 --> 01:07:38,236
<i>Anyhow, I had three months'grace
before I need face that storm.</i>

1048
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:52,412
Have you taken to using
attar of roses?

1049
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:55,770
- No. Why?
- Thought I could smell it.

1050
01:07:56,764 --> 01:08:00,308
I met such a beautiful woman
on the stairs just now.

1051
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,231
I expect that would be
Mrs. D'Ascoyne.

1052
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,597
- What was she doing here?
- She called in to see me.

1053
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:07,085
- What about?
- Business. Family business.

1054
01:08:07,192 --> 01:08:09,426
Let me get you a glass of sherry.

1055
01:08:13,365 --> 01:08:16,299
<i>A day or so later, I received a letter from Lionel.</i>

1056
01:08:16,404 --> 01:08:20,047
<i>He requested an interview with me
at his house on a matter of some delicacy.</i>

1057
01:08:20,146 --> 01:08:23,048
<i>I was somewhat perturbed,
for nine times out of 10...</i>

1058
01:08:23,153 --> 01:08:25,902
<i>what is referred to
as a matter of some delicacy...</i>

1059
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:29,447
<i>is, in point of fact,
one of extreme indelicacy.</i>

1060
01:08:29,551 --> 01:08:33,128
<i>Two days later
I made the tedious journey to Bayswater.</i>

1061
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:36,545
<i>It was typical of Lionel that he should
live on the wrong side of the park.</i>

1062
01:08:36,652 --> 01:08:39,782
Hello, old boy. Have a drink.

1063
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:42,271
No, thank you.
Never during the day.

1064
01:08:42,378 --> 01:08:45,760
You don't mind if I do?
Keep out the cold.

1065
01:08:45,865 --> 01:08:48,254
I was about to remark
on the warmth of the day.

1066
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,293
- Just a joke, old boy.
- Ah, yes.

1067
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:55,010
- Sit down, old boy.
- No, thank you. I would rather stand.

1068
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:00,963
A warm day, isn't it?
For the time of the year, I mean.

1069
01:09:01,059 --> 01:09:04,408
Distinctly.
It's also a very busy day.

1070
01:09:04,514 --> 01:09:06,847
May we proceed to the matter
about which you wished to see me?

1071
01:09:06,946 --> 01:09:10,239
Right. A matter of some delicacy,
actually, old boy.

1072
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:15,158
But I said to myself,
"Louis's a sport and a man of the world.

1073
01:09:15,262 --> 01:09:17,945
<i>- Always been a sport. "
- Thank you.</i>

1074
01:09:18,045 --> 01:09:22,865
<i>Always admired the sporting way in which
you took to Sibella marrying me and not you.</i>

1075
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:25,240
<i>Some fellows would have
taken it very differently.</i>

1076
01:09:25,338 --> 01:09:28,021
But "May the best man win,"
you said.

1077
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,194
<i>And when I won,
you behaved like a gentleman.</i>

1078
01:09:30,297 --> 01:09:32,270
<i>So I thought as...</i>

1079
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:35,223
<i>you being keen on Sibella
at one time...</i>

1080
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:39,344
and you and I are old friends,
I - I'd ask you to help us.

1081
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:41,267
Help you?

1082
01:09:41,365 --> 01:09:43,852
I told you some time back
business hasn't been going so well.

1083
01:09:43,955 --> 01:09:48,144
<i>Since then, it's gone worse.
I'm bankrupt.</i>

1084
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:52,845
So I say to myself,
"Why not talk to my old pal, Louis Mazzini...

1085
01:09:52,944 --> 01:09:57,285
"who we used to have such jolly times with
round the old nursery fire...

1086
01:09:57,391 --> 01:09:59,845
<i>roasting chestnuts. "</i>

1087
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,924
I'm afraid your memory is deceiving you.

1088
01:10:02,029 --> 01:10:06,250
By no stretch of imagination could you and I
be described as ever having been pals.

1089
01:10:06,348 --> 01:10:09,761
If I remember correctly, we detested each other
cordially from the first day we met...

1090
01:10:09,866 --> 01:10:12,418
with a detestation
which increased with our years.

1091
01:10:12,521 --> 01:10:16,164
Always thought of you as a pal.
Always have done.

1092
01:10:16,264 --> 01:10:18,173
That's why I said to myself-

1093
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:22,588
It's only fair to warn you that any further expense
of breath on this subject would be a waste.

1094
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:25,562
You know what you're doing?

1095
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:28,450
- Condemning me to death.
- What do you mean?

1096
01:10:28,548 --> 01:10:32,159
Only one way out for me:
do away with myself.

1097
01:10:32,258 --> 01:10:34,559
If you knew how absurd
these histrionics sounded -

1098
01:10:34,657 --> 01:10:38,104
I'm insured. At least the little woman
will be provided for.

1099
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:41,687
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- Louis, I appeal to you.

1100
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:45,367
Not for my sake,
but for the sake of the little woman.

1101
01:10:45,468 --> 01:10:50,202
Please rise from that absurd position.

1102
01:11:02,455 --> 01:11:05,650
All I can say is
I th-think you're a cad.

1103
01:11:05,749 --> 01:11:07,691
A selfish cad.

1104
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,078
Let me remind you of a little
not-so-ancient history.

1105
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:16,934
When I was a draper's assistant and you
a rich father's son, you showed me no kindness.

1106
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:20,389
Now our positions are reversed,
and you come whining to me for favors.

1107
01:11:20,497 --> 01:11:23,179
Draper's assistant.
That's right.

1108
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,864
Rotten little counterjumper.
That's all you are.

1109
01:11:25,966 --> 01:11:28,932
<i>Very high and mighty now...</i>

1110
01:11:29,037 --> 01:11:32,102
<i>but your mother married
an Italian organ-grinder.</i>

1111
01:11:34,507 --> 01:11:36,329
<i>- Stand up.
- Huh?</i>

1112
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:38,314
I said stand up.

1113
01:11:39,593 --> 01:11:43,105
I will not tolerate hearing
my mother's name on your coarse tongue.

1114
01:11:50,789 --> 01:11:54,104
If you take my advice, you'll go
and put your head under a cold tap.

1115
01:11:54,212 --> 01:11:57,723
I refuse to demean myself
by fighting with a drunken oaf.

1116
01:12:09,311 --> 01:12:12,179
<i>There seemed no point
in prolonging this vulgar brawl...</i>

1117
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:14,325
<i>so I returned to my apartment.</i>

1118
01:12:20,889 --> 01:12:23,671
<i>I took a bath and decided to relax
for half an hour...</i>

1119
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:25,841
<i>and efface this disagreeable scene
from my memory.</i>

1120
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:30,289
<i>I was not allowed to relax for long.</i>

1121
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:36,915
Sibella.

1122
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:43,112
Louis, I'm sorry to worry you
when you must be so busy...

1123
01:12:43,218 --> 01:12:45,770
but I have a piece
of important news.

1124
01:12:45,873 --> 01:12:49,516
Bad news.
I thought you ought to know it at once.

1125
01:12:56,813 --> 01:12:58,721
Lionel has found out about us.

1126
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:01,858
<i>About me coming here.</i>

1127
01:13:01,963 --> 01:13:03,784
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

1128
01:13:03,883 --> 01:13:05,890
Oh.

1129
01:13:05,994 --> 01:13:10,301
I had the most dreadful scene
with him last night.

1130
01:13:10,408 --> 01:13:14,018
Well, I suppose even Lionel isn't
stupid enough to be deceived forever.

1131
01:13:14,118 --> 01:13:16,321
You won't take it so calmly
when you hear.

1132
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:19,709
He's going to start
divorce proceedings.

1133
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,885
How very unsophisticated of him.

1134
01:13:23,204 --> 01:13:27,643
There's only one possible
way out that I can see.

1135
01:13:29,024 --> 01:13:32,635
- And that is?
- Lionel is still in love with me.

1136
01:13:32,736 --> 01:13:36,150
My happiness
is all he cares about.

1137
01:13:36,254 --> 01:13:39,830
He might do the gentlemanly thing
and let me divorce him.

1138
01:13:39,933 --> 01:13:41,819
If?

1139
01:13:42,811 --> 01:13:44,851
If I were in a position to explain to him...

1140
01:13:44,955 --> 01:13:49,874
that otherwise he will be jeopardizing
the social position not only of the future duke...

1141
01:13:49,976 --> 01:13:53,521
but also the future
duchess of Chalfont.

1142
01:13:54,968 --> 01:13:56,877
I see.

1143
01:14:02,645 --> 01:14:05,491
You're a clever little thing, Sibella,
but not quite clever enough.

1144
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:07,409
What do you mean?

1145
01:14:07,507 --> 01:14:09,872
I mean that not only do I know
that you're blackmailing me -

1146
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,857
an ugly word,
but the only appropriate one -

1147
01:14:11,953 --> 01:14:14,341
but I also know
that you're bluffing me.

1148
01:14:14,448 --> 01:14:16,455
Call my bluff and see.

1149
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,446
I will.

1150
01:14:21,549 --> 01:14:25,770
Let me explain. It must have seemed to you
that you hold a very strong hand...

1151
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,940
but - a very important "but" -

1152
01:14:28,043 --> 01:14:31,936
it so happens that I hold a card which
you did not even know to be in the pack.

1153
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,864
Who's bluffing now?

1154
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:36,579
<i>It so happens that I was with Lionel
less than an hour ago.</i>

1155
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:39,876
<i>And it was transparently clear
from his demeanor and conversation...</i>

1156
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:43,203
that he had not the faintest suspicion
that you and I had any relationship...

1157
01:14:43,302 --> 01:14:46,235
<i>other than that of-
as he would probably put it-</i>

1158
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:50,877
old pals who used to roast chestnuts
together round the jolly old nursery fire.

1159
01:14:52,578 --> 01:14:55,511
So, while thanking you
for the honor that you've done me...

1160
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:58,137
I must decline your offer
because I have other arrangements...

1161
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,063
which make it impossible for me
to accept it.

1162
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,980
Namely?

1163
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:04,860
I'm shortly going to announce
my engagement to Mrs. D'Ascoyne.

1164
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:16,593
May I say that I think
you've behaved despicably?

1165
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:22,678
Has it ever occurred to you, Sibella,
that we serve each other right, you and I?

1166
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:32,143
Would it be asking too much of your manners
to escort me to the door?

1167
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:41,735
<i>I had suspected
that to confide our secret to the duke...</i>

1168
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:44,774
<i>might be an adroit maneuver,
and I was proved correct...</i>

1169
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:49,318
<i>for it produced an invitation for Edith and me
to spend a few days at the castle.</i>

1170
01:15:50,318 --> 01:15:54,025
<i>I must confess that I could not suppress
an agreeable sensation of triumph...</i>

1171
01:15:54,123 --> 01:15:56,194
<i>as I approached
the castle gateway...</i>

1172
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:59,527
<i>in circumstances so different
from those in which I had last done so.</i>

1173
01:16:00,586 --> 01:16:02,789
<i>It was just an informal
little house party.</i>

1174
01:16:03,784 --> 01:16:07,809
<i>Our fellow guests were Lady Redpole
and her daughter Maud...</i>

1175
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:10,626
<i>who most suitably resembled
nothing so much as a red poll cow...</i>

1176
01:16:10,726 --> 01:16:12,613
<i>and had little more
conversational ability.</i>

1177
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:16,188
- Did you go to the opera this season?
- No.

1178
01:16:18,819 --> 01:16:22,080
<i>In the afternoon,
Ethelred invited me to inspect the castle.</i>

1179
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:24,064
<i>It was pleasant to stand
on the battlements...</i>

1180
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,127
<i>and know that the acres
which stretched as far as the eye could see...</i>

1181
01:16:27,232 --> 01:16:29,652
<i>would soon be mine.</i>

1182
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:33,619
<i>And it amused me to cover much the same
ground as that of my sixpenny tour.</i>

1183
01:16:34,684 --> 01:16:37,050
<i>I had never been in a building
so lavishly equipped...</i>

1184
01:16:37,148 --> 01:16:39,154
<i>with the instruments
of violent death.</i>

1185
01:16:39,259 --> 01:16:41,266
Feel the weight of that.

1186
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:44,053
Our ancestors must have
been fine men, Louis.

1187
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:48,623
<i>They seemed, however, ill-adapted...</i>

1188
01:16:48,727 --> 01:16:51,541
<i>to the discreet requirements
of 20th-century homicide.</i>

1189
01:16:52,534 --> 01:16:57,170
<i>And the end of the day found my host
still intact and myself still without a plan.</i>

1190
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:06,191
Beautiful woman, Edith.

1191
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:08,110
You're a lucky fellow, Louis.

1192
01:17:08,209 --> 01:17:10,663
I never cease to be conscious of that.

1193
01:17:10,768 --> 01:17:12,971
- Thank you.
- What do you think of Maud?

1194
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:17,770
Uh, charming girl, though perhaps at times
her conversation is a little, uh, lacking in sparkle.

1195
01:17:17,868 --> 01:17:20,137
Dullest woman
I ever met in my life.

1196
01:17:22,091 --> 01:17:24,360
Plain too.

1197
01:17:24,459 --> 01:17:26,913
But good breeding stock.

1198
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:30,948
Good breeding stock,
the Redpoles.

1199
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:34,464
And they litter a very high
proportion of boys.

1200
01:17:36,038 --> 01:17:37,860
Do I gather you to mean -

1201
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:40,510
Spoke to old Lady Redpole
this afternoon.

1202
01:17:40,613 --> 01:17:43,546
Only too glad to get the girl
off her hands.

1203
01:17:43,652 --> 01:17:45,538
My congratulations.

1204
01:17:46,817 --> 01:17:49,370
Duty to the family, really.

1205
01:17:49,473 --> 01:17:51,612
And when does the, uh,
union take place?

1206
01:17:51,712 --> 01:17:54,232
Very soon.
I'm not growing any younger.

1207
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,978
Mightn't get a son the first time.
Quiet wedding, I thought.

1208
01:17:58,077 --> 01:18:00,379
<i>Maud's hardly the type
for St. Margaret's.</i>

1209
01:18:01,437 --> 01:18:04,339
We shall honeymoon on the Riviera
and then go on to Italy afterwards.

1210
01:18:05,341 --> 01:18:07,827
No sense inflicting her
on one's friends.

1211
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:12,144
<i>When she's got a family,
that'll keep her out of the way.</i>

1212
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,625
<i>This news threw me into such distress of mind...</i>

1213
01:18:16,727 --> 01:18:19,061
<i>that, had I had poison
in my possession...</i>

1214
01:18:19,158 --> 01:18:21,743
<i>I would probably have administered it
to Ethelred there and then...</i>

1215
01:18:21,846 --> 01:18:24,562
<i>and chanced
the consequent inquiries.</i>

1216
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,451
<i>One thing was clear-
If I did not succeed in disposing ofhim...</i>

1217
01:18:29,555 --> 01:18:31,888
<i>during this present visit
to the castle...</i>

1218
01:18:31,985 --> 01:18:34,833
<i>I was likely to see the ruin
of my whole campaign.</i>

1219
01:18:37,712 --> 01:18:40,428
My best wishes
for a successful outcome.

1220
01:18:42,894 --> 01:18:45,031
<i>The next morning
I went out shooting with Ethelred...</i>

1221
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:46,955
<i>or rather,
to watch Ethelred shooting...</i>

1222
01:18:47,053 --> 01:18:50,313
<i>for my principles will not allow me
to take a direct part in blood sports.</i>

1223
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:53,345
- Been round the traps this morning, Hoskins?
- Not yet, Your Grace.

1224
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:55,937
<i>Sounds as if we've bagged one there.</i>

1225
01:18:56,042 --> 01:19:00,992
Ah. Been losing so much game lately,
we've started setting the mantraps again.

1226
01:19:08,644 --> 01:19:11,578
Hoskins is now going to thrash you.

1227
01:19:11,683 --> 01:19:13,505
Then he'll let you go.

1228
01:19:13,602 --> 01:19:16,667
Let this be a lesson to you
not to poach on my land.

1229
01:19:26,782 --> 01:19:28,603
That'll do.

1230
01:19:36,826 --> 01:19:40,021
Keep moving them around, Hoskins,
or they'll tell each other where they are.

1231
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,007
Yes, Your Grace.

1232
01:19:43,607 --> 01:19:45,811
- I thought mantraps were illegal.
- They are.

1233
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:47,732
What happens
if he tells the police?

1234
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:50,578
He comes up before the bench for poaching,
gets six months in jail.

1235
01:19:50,676 --> 01:19:54,417
If he keeps his mouth shut,
he just gets a few days in bed.

1236
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:57,298
<i>Which would you choose?</i>

1237
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:04,648
Only way to deal with
these ruffians, I assure you.

1238
01:20:05,647 --> 01:20:08,876
Oh. I must have dropped my cigarette case
back there. I'll catch you up.

1239
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:28,133
- Find it?
- Yes, thanks.

1240
01:20:28,231 --> 01:20:31,840
Might have another walk round
this afternoon, if you feel like it.

1241
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:33,915
That would be
most pleasant.

1242
01:20:34,021 --> 01:20:38,329
<i>After luncheon we went out
to massacre a few more unfortunate birds.</i>

1243
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:41,153
- Listen.
- What is it?

1244
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:43,900
I thought I heard something,
like someone running through the bracken.

1245
01:20:44,001 --> 01:20:46,237
Another poaching ruffian!
Come on!

1246
01:20:51,007 --> 01:20:53,209
There was someone here. Look.

1247
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:56,146
<i>Blast!</i>

1248
01:20:56,253 --> 01:20:59,002
Louis, get me out of this.
Hurry up, man.

1249
01:21:02,938 --> 01:21:05,654
- Have you gone mad?
- Be quiet, Ethelred.

1250
01:21:05,753 --> 01:21:08,175
I want to talk to you
for a minute.

1251
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,246
If you make a noise,
I shall blow your head off at once.

1252
01:21:13,014 --> 01:21:15,021
By the time anyone
has heard the shot...

1253
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:18,441
I shall be running back toward the castle,
shouting for help.

1254
01:21:19,476 --> 01:21:21,898
I shall say that you
stepped on the trap...

1255
01:21:22,004 --> 01:21:24,457
and that your gun went off
accidentally as it fell.

1256
01:21:24,561 --> 01:21:26,449
So be quiet.

1257
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:30,281
To spare you as much pain
as possible...

1258
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,271
I'll be brief.

1259
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:38,694
When I've finished,
I shall kill you.

1260
01:21:39,981 --> 01:21:42,533
<i>You'll be the sixth D'Ascoyne
that I've killed.</i>

1261
01:21:42,636 --> 01:21:45,220
You want to know why?

1262
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:47,972
In return for what
the D'Ascoynes did to my mother.

1263
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:54,597
Because she married for love
instead of for rank or money or land...

1264
01:21:54,695 --> 01:21:57,563
they condemned her to a life
of poverty and slavery...

1265
01:21:57,670 --> 01:22:00,058
in a world with which
they had not equipped her to deal.

1266
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:03,099
<i>You yourself refused
to grant her dying wish...</i>

1267
01:22:03,204 --> 01:22:05,307
<i>which was to be buried
here at Chalfont.</i>

1268
01:22:05,411 --> 01:22:08,726
When I saw her poor little coffin
slide underground...

1269
01:22:09,794 --> 01:22:12,477
saw her exiled in death
as she'd been in life...

1270
01:22:13,665 --> 01:22:17,557
I swore to have my revenge
on your intolerable pride.

1271
01:22:18,782 --> 01:22:23,157
That revenge
I am just about to complete.

1272
01:22:26,331 --> 01:22:28,534
It's clear that you are insane.

1273
01:22:28,635 --> 01:22:30,456
Give me that gun at once.

1274
01:22:30,555 --> 01:22:32,441
No.

1275
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:39,019
From here, I think, the wound should look
consistent with the story that I shall tell.

1276
01:22:48,116 --> 01:22:50,024
<i>Help.!</i>

1277
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:53,294
Help! Help!

1278
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:56,010
<i>And so Ethelred...</i>

1279
01:22:56,113 --> 01:22:59,886
<i>eighth duke of Chalfont,
duly came to his place in the family vault.</i>

1280
01:23:04,942 --> 01:23:07,177
<i>There were few D'Ascoynes
left to mourn him...</i>

1281
01:23:07,276 --> 01:23:10,919
<i>my employer, who was ninth duke of Chalfont
for the shortest possible period...</i>

1282
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:14,367
<i>having expired of shock on hearing
that he had succeeded to the title.</i>

1283
01:23:16,776 --> 01:23:21,085
<i>And so... I became
the 10th duke of Chalfont.</i>

1284
01:23:24,647 --> 01:23:27,645
<i>Fortunately, the ninth duke
had found time before he expired...</i>

1285
01:23:27,749 --> 01:23:31,010
<i>to make a will bequeathing to me
his interests in the business.</i>

1286
01:23:33,635 --> 01:23:35,490
You may remove that.

1287
01:23:43,455 --> 01:23:46,454
<i>A day or two later,
an affecting little feudal ceremony took place...</i>

1288
01:23:46,559 --> 01:23:48,466
<i>to welcome me into residence
at the castle.</i>

1289
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:51,540
And I promise you
that my first consideration...

1290
01:23:51,644 --> 01:23:56,596
and that of Mrs. D'Ascoyne, who has
done me the honor to consent to be my bride...

1291
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:01,072
will be the welfare of the estate
and of the people who live on it.

1292
01:24:01,176 --> 01:24:05,452
God bless you all.

1293
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:11,828
<i>Long live His Grace.!</i>

1294
01:24:11,925 --> 01:24:13,812
<i>Long live His Grace.</i>

1295
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:23,182
Pennyman, Your Grace,
from Sprockett's Farm.

1296
01:24:23,281 --> 01:24:25,102
Mrs. Pennyman.

1297
01:24:25,201 --> 01:24:27,109
My son, Tom,
from Sprockett's Farm.

1298
01:24:27,216 --> 01:24:30,083
Mr. Wyvold,
from Sprockett's Farm.

1299
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,036
Sprockett's Farm?

1300
01:24:34,124 --> 01:24:36,459
No, Your Grace.
From Scotland Yard.

1301
01:24:38,988 --> 01:24:40,808
Scotland Yard?

1302
01:24:40,906 --> 01:24:42,880
A matter of some delicacy.

1303
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,107
Follow me, please.

1304
01:24:50,214 --> 01:24:54,042
<i>The blow was so sudden
that I found it hard to collect my thoughts.</i>

1305
01:24:55,493 --> 01:24:57,948
<i>Which of them could it be?</i>

1306
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:01,727
<i>Young Ascoyne?
Henry? Ethelred?</i>

1307
01:25:01,826 --> 01:25:05,141
<i>The parson?
The general?</i>

1308
01:25:05,249 --> 01:25:08,893
<i>Lady Agatha?
Or could it be all of them?</i>

1309
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:17,685
- Now.
- You are, I take it, His Grace, the duke of Chalfont?

1310
01:25:17,788 --> 01:25:21,431
- I am.
- I am Detective Inspector Burgoyne...

1311
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:23,569
of the Criminal
Investigation Department.

1312
01:25:23,674 --> 01:25:25,910
And I hold a warrant for your arrest
on a charge of murder.

1313
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:28,114
Murder?

1314
01:25:28,217 --> 01:25:30,038
<i>Of murdering Mr. Lionel Holland at-</i>

1315
01:25:30,137 --> 01:25:32,372
<i>- Murdering whom?
- Mr. Lionel Holland...</i>

1316
01:25:32,471 --> 01:25:35,601
at number 242 Connaught Square,
Bayswater...

1317
01:25:35,702 --> 01:25:37,774
<i>on the 17th of October last.</i>

1318
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:51,402
<i>Utterly bewildered,
I tried to fathom what series of events...</i>

1319
01:25:51,504 --> 01:25:54,950
<i>could conceivably have led
to this not-very-amusing irony.</i>

1320
01:25:55,055 --> 01:25:57,356
<i>I could only suppose that Lionel
had actually carried out...</i>

1321
01:25:57,454 --> 01:25:59,396
<i>that drunken threat of suicide.</i>

1322
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:02,696
<i>But how then had the blame
fallen on me?</i>

1323
01:26:02,795 --> 01:26:06,090
<i>Time alone-and the trial-
would reveal the answer.</i>

1324
01:26:06,186 --> 01:26:09,731
<i>Seeing no reason to forego any of
the available privileges of my rank...</i>

1325
01:26:14,088 --> 01:26:17,665
<i>I exercised my right to be tried
before the House of Lords.</i>

1326
01:26:17,766 --> 01:26:21,660
Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, duke of Chalfont...

1327
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:24,830
you, as a peer of England,
are indicted for murder.

1328
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:26,971
How say you, Your Grace?

1329
01:26:27,076 --> 01:26:31,165
Are you guilty of the felony with which
you are charged or not guilty?

1330
01:26:31,266 --> 01:26:33,632
- Not guilty.
- How will you be tried?

1331
01:26:35,104 --> 01:26:40,285
<i>- By God and my peers.
- God send Your Grace a good deliverance.</i>

1332
01:26:40,382 --> 01:26:44,755
It shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth...

1333
01:26:44,861 --> 01:26:46,747
<i>so help me God.</i>

1334
01:26:46,844 --> 01:26:50,291
<i>Mrs. Holland, will you tell
Their Lordships in your own words...</i>

1335
01:26:50,395 --> 01:26:52,816
the substance of the conversation
you had with your husband...

1336
01:26:52,922 --> 01:26:54,895
the evening before his death?

1337
01:26:56,472 --> 01:26:59,668
He told me that Louis -
the prisoner-

1338
01:26:59,766 --> 01:27:02,994
was coming to see him the next day
on a rather delicate matter.

1339
01:27:03,095 --> 01:27:05,002
Did he indicate
what that matter was?

1340
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:10,159
He had discovered that
the prisoner and I had been -

1341
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:13,937
Had been on terms of intimacy?

1342
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:17,034
<i>- Yes.
- And what was his attitude?</i>

1343
01:27:17,137 --> 01:27:20,169
<i>He felt that the correct thing to do...</i>

1344
01:27:20,271 --> 01:27:24,526
was to tell him to his face that he intended
to start proceedings for divorce.

1345
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:26,530
<i>From your knowledge of the prisoner...</i>

1346
01:27:26,636 --> 01:27:28,840
<i>how would you expect him
to receive that news?</i>

1347
01:27:30,187 --> 01:27:32,838
I should expect him
to be very angry.

1348
01:27:32,939 --> 01:27:36,516
Now he was heir to a dukedom,
he had no more use for me.

1349
01:27:36,617 --> 01:27:39,911
I see. He was trying to discard you.

1350
01:27:40,009 --> 01:27:41,830
- Yes.
- Mrs. Holland...

1351
01:27:41,928 --> 01:27:44,829
I apologize for submitting you
to this ordeal...

1352
01:27:44,934 --> 01:27:48,893
but will you tell Their Lordships
how you found your husband's body?

1353
01:27:51,172 --> 01:27:53,692
I came back about half past 4:00.

1354
01:27:56,002 --> 01:27:59,547
<i>Their Lordships have no objection
to the witness being seated.</i>

1355
01:28:03,615 --> 01:28:05,851
Yes, Mrs. Holland?

1356
01:28:07,262 --> 01:28:09,814
I came back about half past 4:00.

1357
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:12,786
I went into my husband's study.

1358
01:28:12,892 --> 01:28:15,314
He was lying on the floor...

1359
01:28:16,379 --> 01:28:18,800
with a dagger stuck in his chest.

1360
01:28:18,906 --> 01:28:21,011
<i>One last question,
Mrs. Holland.</i>

1361
01:28:21,113 --> 01:28:24,528
<i>Had your husband ever, at any time,
threatened suicide?</i>

1362
01:28:25,528 --> 01:28:28,111
- Never.
- Thank you, Mrs. Holland.

1363
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,163
My client craves
Their Lordships' permission...

1364
01:28:33,269 --> 01:28:35,656
to cross-examine
the witness himself.

1365
01:28:35,764 --> 01:28:38,064
Their Lordships grant their permission.

1366
01:28:41,361 --> 01:28:45,289
Mrs. Holland, you understand
the meaning of being on oath?

1367
01:28:45,392 --> 01:28:47,496
Of course.

1368
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:52,324
You realize that a life may depend upon
the truthfulness of your evidence?

1369
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:55,530
Yes.

1370
01:28:56,781 --> 01:28:59,648
I put it to you that your story
of your conversation with your husband...

1371
01:28:59,755 --> 01:29:01,991
on the night before his death
is a complete fabrication.

1372
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,358
It is not.

1373
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:06,846
I put it to you
that your husband committed suicide.

1374
01:29:06,953 --> 01:29:10,267
He would never have done that
without leaving a message for me.

1375
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,447
Can you swear that he did not?

1376
01:29:13,478 --> 01:29:15,386
The police searched the room
very thoroughly.

1377
01:29:16,869 --> 01:29:18,690
They didn't find anything.

1378
01:29:20,164 --> 01:29:24,123
I suggest that your evidence is a tissue of lies
dictated by motives of revenge.

1379
01:29:27,616 --> 01:29:31,193
It is not.

1380
01:29:31,295 --> 01:29:33,116
It is not.

1381
01:29:33,214 --> 01:29:36,508
I presume that the prisoner has some
purpose in these submissions...

1382
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:39,157
other than that of
distressing the witness.

1383
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:41,332
My purpose, my lord,
is to determine the truth.

1384
01:29:42,396 --> 01:29:45,743
That, Your Grace,
is the whole purpose of this assembly.

1385
01:29:47,705 --> 01:29:51,478
...the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help me God.

1386
01:29:54,871 --> 01:29:58,732
- You're Edith D'Ascoyne Mazzini, duchess of Chalfont?
- I am.

1387
01:29:58,837 --> 01:30:02,730
<i>When and where did you become
the wife of the accused?</i>

1388
01:30:02,835 --> 01:30:06,610
<i>Yesterday morning, in Pentonville Prison.</i>

1389
01:30:06,706 --> 01:30:10,381
I wanted to publish irrevocably
before the whole world...

1390
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,367
my faith in his innocence.

1391
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,173
I wanted to show
by my marriage...

1392
01:30:16,271 --> 01:30:18,539
that though he was led astray,
as I believe...

1393
01:30:18,638 --> 01:30:21,767
by that innate kindliness
and courtesy of his...

1394
01:30:21,869 --> 01:30:24,650
which made it so hard for him to rebuff
the advances of a woman...

1395
01:30:24,747 --> 01:30:26,570
<i>I nevertheless
regard him as a man...</i>

1396
01:30:26,667 --> 01:30:29,284
to whom I can happily entrust
the remainder of my life.

1397
01:30:29,386 --> 01:30:31,773
I am not alone
in these opinions of him.

1398
01:30:32,776 --> 01:30:36,637
My late husband, Henry,
and his late Uncle Ethelred, the eighth duke -

1399
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:40,453
both unfortunately
unable to testify today.

1400
01:30:41,445 --> 01:30:45,121
<i>These and other members of the D'Ascoyne family,
had they been alive...</i>

1401
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:48,602
would, I know, have echoed
every word that I have said.

1402
01:30:48,707 --> 01:30:50,595
<i>Thank you, Your Grace.</i>

1403
01:30:51,617 --> 01:30:53,624
The deceased was a client
of the banking house...

1404
01:30:53,728 --> 01:30:56,445
- of which you are chairman and managing director.
- He was.

1405
01:30:56,544 --> 01:30:58,910
In the normal course
of business transactions...

1406
01:30:59,007 --> 01:31:01,788
- he would have come to see you at your office.
- Yes.

1407
01:31:01,886 --> 01:31:05,049
- Instead of which, he asked you to go to his house.
- Yes.

1408
01:31:05,148 --> 01:31:08,595
- He invited you to his house to discuss business.
- Yes.

1409
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,739
And you ask Their Lordships
to believe that?

1410
01:31:11,802 --> 01:31:15,149
- Yes.
- In the course of this, uh, business discussion...

1411
01:31:15,256 --> 01:31:18,387
he burst into tears, fell on his knees
and threatened suicide.

1412
01:31:18,488 --> 01:31:21,804
<i>- Yes.
- Is that usual in business discussions?</i>

1413
01:31:21,911 --> 01:31:24,528
<i>- Not usual. No.
- But it happened on this occasion.</i>

1414
01:31:24,629 --> 01:31:27,792
<i>- Yes.
- And you ask Their Lordships to believe that?</i>

1415
01:31:27,893 --> 01:31:31,437
- Yes.
- Then this, uh, business discussion...

1416
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:33,927
became so heated
that blows were exchanged...

1417
01:31:34,034 --> 01:31:36,651
<i>- and he made a murderous attack on you.
- Yes.</i>

1418
01:31:36,753 --> 01:31:40,101
<i>- Is that usual in business discussion?
- No.</i>

1419
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:42,792
- But it happened on this occasion.
- Yes.

1420
01:31:42,894 --> 01:31:46,887
<i>- And you ask Their Lordships to believe that?
- Yes.</i>

1421
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:49,291
Very well.

1422
01:31:49,388 --> 01:31:52,803
You've heard of cases of a jealous husband
and his wife's lover coming to blows?

1423
01:31:52,908 --> 01:31:55,721
<i>- Yes.
- Frequently?</i>

1424
01:31:55,818 --> 01:32:00,388
<i>It is one of the clichs of the cheaper kind of fiction.</i>

1425
01:32:01,576 --> 01:32:04,324
I put it to you that,
in this case, it happened...

1426
01:32:04,423 --> 01:32:06,332
not in fiction,
but in fact.

1427
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:09,699
<i>- I put it to you that it did not.
- I put it to you further...</i>

1428
01:32:09,797 --> 01:32:13,658
that being unaware at that time
of your future wife's forgiving nature...

1429
01:32:13,764 --> 01:32:16,151
you assumed that if you were
cited in a divorce suit...

1430
01:32:16,258 --> 01:32:19,803
it would ruin your chances
of making this advantageous match...

1431
01:32:19,905 --> 01:32:22,272
<i>with a wealthy and beautiful woman.</i>

1432
01:32:23,392 --> 01:32:25,214
No. Not at all.

1433
01:32:25,311 --> 01:32:29,914
<i>- Still, you were proposing to discard Mrs. Holland.
- No.</i>

1434
01:32:30,014 --> 01:32:33,275
Even though you were
about to be married to the other lady?

1435
01:32:40,762 --> 01:32:44,109
I must confess to feeling
quite intrigued as to their decision.

1436
01:32:52,853 --> 01:32:57,902
My lords, the question
for Your Lordships is this:

1437
01:32:58,898 --> 01:33:00,721
Is the prisoner guilty...

1438
01:33:00,818 --> 01:33:04,395
of the felony whereof
he stands indicted...

1439
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:06,438
or not guilty?

1440
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,654
Guilty, upon mine honor.

1441
01:33:11,758 --> 01:33:14,986
Guilty, upon mine honor.

1442
01:33:15,086 --> 01:33:17,539
Guilty, upon mine honor.

1443
01:33:25,353 --> 01:33:29,093
I considered it both seemly and touching
that my dear wife should visit me...

1444
01:33:29,192 --> 01:33:32,038
as she did this morning,
to make her farewells.

1445
01:33:33,478 --> 01:33:36,227
Your arrival, on the other hand,
appears to me unseemly...

1446
01:33:36,325 --> 01:33:38,212
and tasteless in the extreme.

1447
01:33:39,236 --> 01:33:42,977
I couldn't bear my last sight of you
to be that look of hatred you gave me...

1448
01:33:43,074 --> 01:33:45,343
as you went out from the trial.

1449
01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:49,334
In view of the fact that your evidence
had put the rope round my neck...

1450
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,123
you could hardly expect
a glance of warm affection.

1451
01:33:52,223 --> 01:33:55,321
- Isn't there any hope?
- What hope could there be?

1452
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:59,001
I was only thinking.

1453
01:33:59,101 --> 01:34:01,816
That question you asked at the trial...

1454
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:04,533
about Lionel leaving
a suicide note.

1455
01:34:05,947 --> 01:34:08,848
Suppose he did?
Suppose that one were found...

1456
01:34:08,953 --> 01:34:12,465
even now,
this last evening?

1457
01:34:12,567 --> 01:34:15,949
<i>- It would savor of a miracle.
- Miracles can happen.</i>

1458
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:19,853
Miracles could happen.

1459
01:34:23,348 --> 01:34:25,170
I see.

1460
01:34:25,267 --> 01:34:28,877
Oh. Strange, isn't it,
how things turn out?

1461
01:34:28,978 --> 01:34:31,628
Now, if you had married me,
instead of Edith -

1462
01:34:31,728 --> 01:34:35,405
Or you had married me,
instead of Lionel.

1463
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:39,974
<i>He would still be alive, and you wouldn't be
going to be hanged tomorrow morning.</i>

1464
01:34:40,078 --> 01:34:43,044
Unless, of course, you've murdered somebody else.

1465
01:34:47,564 --> 01:34:50,180
<i>- All of which is rather beside the point, isn't it?
- Is it?</i>

1466
01:34:53,257 --> 01:34:55,428
Do you remember
in the old days...

1467
01:34:55,528 --> 01:34:58,527
how we used to play
eeny, meeny, miny, mo?

1468
01:34:58,631 --> 01:35:03,582
<i>- Catch a nigger by his toe.
- If he hollers, let him go. Out goes he.</i>

1469
01:35:04,996 --> 01:35:08,508
<i>Quite a lot oflittle niggers have gone out,
haven't they, one way or another?</i>

1470
01:35:08,612 --> 01:35:11,708
And every one of them a D'Ascoyne.

1471
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,271
Mmm. We do seem to be
a very short-lived family.

1472
01:35:19,424 --> 01:35:22,837
Of course, Edith is only
a D'Ascoyne by marriage...

1473
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:25,210
so I suppose
her prospects are better.

1474
01:35:28,317 --> 01:35:30,290
Except for a miracle.

1475
01:35:30,395 --> 01:35:32,729
Like the other one
we were talking about.

1476
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:36,240
<i>So there it was.
She would find the suicide note...</i>

1477
01:35:36,346 --> 01:35:39,541
<i>if I, in return,
would murder Edith.</i>

1478
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:42,420
So we now have two miracles
in mind, do we?

1479
01:35:42,518 --> 01:35:44,340
<i>Yes.</i>

1480
01:35:44,437 --> 01:35:47,753
I wonder if they are, in any way,
dependent on each other?

1481
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,115
I suppose perhaps they might be.

1482
01:35:53,107 --> 01:35:54,994
What do you think?

1483
01:35:56,658 --> 01:35:58,545
Time's up.

1484
01:36:02,575 --> 01:36:04,461
What do you think?

1485
01:36:05,646 --> 01:36:09,770
Poor Edith. I'm afraid all this is going
to take years off her life.

1486
01:36:12,907 --> 01:36:16,070
- Au revoir, Louis.
- Au revoir.

1487
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:19,263
<i>What could I do but accept?</i>

1488
01:36:19,369 --> 01:36:22,368
<i>After all, I could
always decide afterwards...</i>

1489
01:36:22,472 --> 01:36:25,220
<i>which of these two little niggers
would finally have to go.</i>

1490
01:36:25,319 --> 01:36:27,490
<i>Dear Edith.</i>

1491
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,411
<i>Captivating Sibella.</i>

1492
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:33,086
<i>How different they were,
and how well I knew each of them.</i>

1493
01:36:34,084 --> 01:36:35,905
"Or so I thought.

1494
01:36:36,004 --> 01:36:39,069
"But the night has gone by
and nothing has happened.

1495
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:41,657
"It is now but a few minutes to 8:00.

1496
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:45,305
"And I realize that Sibella
came yesterday merely to tantalize...

1497
01:36:45,407 --> 01:36:48,440
"to raise my hopes
in order to dash them again.

1498
01:36:48,542 --> 01:36:51,541
"How unlike me
not to have guessed.

1499
01:36:51,646 --> 01:36:55,353
But, after all,
how very like Sibella. "

1500
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:20,594
Already?

1501
01:37:21,651 --> 01:37:23,473
I'll tell you who time gallops withal.

1502
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:25,391
"With a thief to the gallows.

1503
01:37:25,489 --> 01:37:27,944
"For though he tread
as softly as foot can fall...

1504
01:37:28,048 --> 01:37:30,251
he thinks himself too soon there. "

1505
01:37:31,247 --> 01:37:33,069
If you have any last instructions -

1506
01:37:33,167 --> 01:37:37,256
I think, Colonel, it only remains
to thank you for your many kindnessess.

1507
01:37:37,356 --> 01:37:39,179
Won't you introduce our friend?

1508
01:37:40,715 --> 01:37:43,976
Mr. Elliott,
His Grace, the duke of Chalfont.

1509
01:37:45,929 --> 01:37:48,001
Good morning, Your Grace.

1510
01:37:48,104 --> 01:37:49,926
This won't take a moment.

1511
01:37:50,024 --> 01:37:53,852
First, if Your Grace
will pardon the liberty...

1512
01:37:53,959 --> 01:37:56,641
I should like to read
some verses...

1513
01:37:56,741 --> 01:38:00,089
composed by myself for use
on these melancholy occasions.

1514
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:04,539
- Your Grace permits?
- With pleasure.

1515
01:38:08,065 --> 01:38:12,439
"My friend, reflect" -

1516
01:38:12,543 --> 01:38:15,259
Oh. Oh. Pardon.

1517
01:38:15,358 --> 01:38:17,812
"Your Grace, reflect.

1518
01:38:17,918 --> 01:38:21,080
"While yet of
mortal breath some span...

1519
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:23,994
"however short, is left to thee...

1520
01:38:24,093 --> 01:38:27,985
"how brief the total span
twixt birth and death...

1521
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:33,139
"how long thy coming
tenure of eternity.

1522
01:38:34,936 --> 01:38:37,618
Your Grace, prepare" -

1523
01:38:41,493 --> 01:38:43,315
- Colonel.
- Hmm?

1524
01:38:48,338 --> 01:38:50,192
Your Grace,
I am happy to inform you...

1525
01:38:50,289 --> 01:38:53,159
that a telephone communication
has just been received from the Home Office.

1526
01:38:53,265 --> 01:38:56,166
A note has been found,
undoubtedly in Mr. Holland's handwriting...

1527
01:38:56,271 --> 01:38:58,921
expressing his intention
to commit suicide.

1528
01:38:59,022 --> 01:39:00,964
It is a miracle.

1529
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:03,819
Yes. It is like a miracle.

1530
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:06,634
Pending receipt
of further instructions...

1531
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:09,697
I will try to make you
reasonably comfortable in my quarters.

1532
01:39:11,017 --> 01:39:13,635
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Your Grace, sir.

1533
01:39:21,446 --> 01:39:25,090
I assure you I have never been
more happy to be relieved of an official duty.

1534
01:39:26,117 --> 01:39:27,937
Poor Elliott.

1535
01:39:28,035 --> 01:39:30,205
If he had not insisted
on reading that abominable poem...

1536
01:39:30,308 --> 01:39:33,340
he would have had me neatly dangling at the end
of his rope before the news arrived.

1537
01:39:33,441 --> 01:39:36,572
- Huh.
- He was so looking forward to it.

1538
01:39:36,672 --> 01:39:38,711
I understand, Your Grace,
from the men on duty outside...

1539
01:39:38,816 --> 01:39:40,790
that a large crowd
awaits your leaving.

1540
01:39:40,895 --> 01:39:42,716
Having robbed them
of the pleasure of my death...

1541
01:39:42,815 --> 01:39:45,051
the least I can do
is to let them see me alive.

1542
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:47,833
Including, by the way,
not only Her Grace, the duchess...

1543
01:39:47,933 --> 01:39:50,005
but also Mrs. Holland.

1544
01:39:50,107 --> 01:39:51,928
Oh.

1545
01:39:52,027 --> 01:39:55,059
How does the song go?
"How happy could I be with either...

1546
01:39:55,161 --> 01:39:56,983
were tother dear charmer away. "

1547
01:39:57,081 --> 01:39:59,022
- Oh.
- Well, good-bye.

1548
01:39:59,128 --> 01:40:01,015
Good-bye, Your Grace.

1549
01:40:32,395 --> 01:40:34,599
"How happy could I be with either...

1550
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:36,838
were tother dear charmer away. "

1551
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:41,699
- Your Grace.
- Yes?

1552
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,971
<i>I represent the magazine Titbits...</i>

1553
01:40:44,072 --> 01:40:45,959
by whom I'm commissioned
to approach you...

1554
01:40:46,055 --> 01:40:48,510
for the publication rights
of your memoirs.

1555
01:40:48,614 --> 01:40:50,752
My memoirs?

1556
01:40:50,853 --> 01:40:52,958
Oh, my memoirs.

1557
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,121
My memoirs.
