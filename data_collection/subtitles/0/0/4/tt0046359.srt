1
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,168
I don't know about you,
but it makes me sore

2
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:21,865
seeing those war pictures
about fIying Ieathernecks,

3
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:26,206
and submarine patroIs, and frogmen,
and gueriIIas in the PhiIippines.

4
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:30,112
What gets me is that there
never was a movie about P.O.W.s...

5
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,946
...about prisoners of war.

6
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:36,886
My name is CIarence Harvey Cook -
they caII me Cookie.

7
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:40,390
I was shot down over Magdeburg,
Germany, back in '43.

8
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:44,088
That's why I stammer sometimes,
especiaIIy when I get excited.

9
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,530
I spent two and a haIf years
in StaIag 17.

10
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,966
''StaIag'' is German for prison camp.

11
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,130
Number 17
was somewhere on the Danube.

12
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:56,469
There were about
40,000 P.O.W.s there

13
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,101
if you count the Russians,
the PoIes and the Czechs.

14
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:03,306
In our compound,
there were about 630 of us.

15
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:09,513
AII American airmen - radio operators,
gunners and engineers. AII sergeants.

16
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:15,788
Put 630 sergeants together and,
oh mother, you've got a situation!

17
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,864
There was more fireworks shooting
off around that joint...

18
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:22,661
Take the story about the spy
we had in our barracks.

19
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:25,635
It was about a week before
Christmas in '44.

20
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:29,173
Two of our guys,
Manfredi and Jonson, to be exact,

21
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:32,142
were just getting set
to bIow the pIace.

22
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:45,783
AnimaI, AnimaI! Get up!

23
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:48,386
Betty GrabIe's on the phone!

24
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:12,802
- Here's your civiIian cIothes.
- O.K., Hoffy.

25
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:16,005
Remember, bury your army outfits
before Ieaving the forest.

26
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:18,946
Your compass
is the top button of this jacket.

27
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:27,719
Anybody asks for your papers,
you're French Iaborers.

28
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,557
Here's your map,
Kraut money, Swiss Francs.

29
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:35,725
- Let's hear it once more.
- We've been over it a hundred times.

30
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,028
Let's hear it again.

31
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,139
We stick to the forest going west
tiII we hit the Danube.

32
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:42,331
We foIIow the Danube up to Linz.

33
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:45,602
In Linz we hop a barge
and go to UIm.

34
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,978
Stop it, Joey!
Joey, go back to sIeep!

35
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:57,282
Go on. You're in UIm.

36
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,881
We Iie Iow untiI night,
then take a train to Friedrichshafen.

37
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:03,552
We steaI a rowboat,
get some fishing tackIe

38
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:07,894
and drift south across the Iake,
tiII we hit the other side - SwitzerIand.

39
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:13,233
Once there, give out a big yodeI,
so we know you're there. It's a breeze.

40
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:16,170
- Stay out of this.
- Just one question.

41
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,209
Did you caIcuIate the risk?

42
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:22,774
Ready!

43
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,618
You've got ten minutes
to get through the tunneI.

44
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:29,381
You'II come out as the Jerries
are changing shifts.

45
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:30,750
BIondie?

46
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,984
- O.K.
- PeeI off.

47
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:38,494
- Show 'em, boys.
- Easy does it.

48
00:05:38,664 --> 00:05:41,155
- We'II miss you, cruds.
- Auf Wiedersehen.

49
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:00,939
They ought to be
under the barbed wire soon.

50
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,172
Looks good outside.

51
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,306
I hope they hit
the Danube before dawn.

52
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,078
They got a good chance.
It's the Iongest night of the year.

53
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,314
- I bet they get to Friedrichshafen.
- I bet they reach SwitzerIand.

54
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:14,517
- I bet they don't get out of the forest.
- What kind of crack is that?

55
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,152
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes
say they don't get out of the forest.

56
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:20,288
Enough, Sefton.
CrawI back in your sack.

57
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,901
He'd bet on his mother
getting hit by a truck!

58
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:25,003
- Anybody caII?
- Sefton, butt out!

59
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:28,504
Wait. I want to back them.
I'II cover ten.

60
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:30,199
- I'II take five.
- Eight.

61
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:31,674
- Put me down for ten.
- Three.

62
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:32,778
I'II take one.

63
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:37,042
- I'II cover the whoIe pot.
- Anything you say. Cookie...

64
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,048
More cigarettes.

65
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,347
- Speak up, boys.
- I'II cover eight.

66
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,556
Here's four.

67
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,248
- Here's two.
- Here's four.

68
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,256
- And four more.
- I'II cover eight.

69
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,361
- Give me three.
- I bet two.

70
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,020
- And a haIf!
- No butts.

71
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:53,688
No butts, no butts.

72
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:56,027
WiII this do or you want more?

73
00:07:56,168 --> 00:08:01,470
That'II do. Speak up, boys.
Any more sports in the crowd?

74
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,675
Let's go.

75
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,938
Those fiIthy Krauts!

76
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,773
- What's Ieft of them, Hoffy?
- Don't ask me.

77
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:15,506
Price was eIected Security.

78
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:18,173
- O.K., what happened?
- I wish I knew.

79
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,683
We pIanned everything
to the Iast detaiI.

80
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,378
Maybe the Krauts knew
about the tunneI aII the time!

81
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:26,081
- Shut up!
- Maybe they were Iaying for them.

82
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:29,092
HoId it, Sefton. I said, hoId it!

83
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:32,994
So we heard some shots.
Who says they didn't get away?

84
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:38,465
Anybody here
want to doubIe their bet?

85
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:06,992
Every morning at six on the dot
they'd have the Appell- that's roII caII.

86
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,533
Every barracks
had its own aIarm cIock.

87
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:14,902
Ours was FeIdwebeI SchuIz.
Johann Sebastian SchuIz.

88
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,737
I understand the Krauts
had a composer way back

89
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:19,742
with a Johann Sebastian in it.

90
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:23,746
But I can teII you one thing,
SchuIz was no composer.

91
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:28,944
He was a Sohweinehund.
Was he ever a Iousy Sohweinehund.

92
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:34,549
Break it off!

93
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:41,458
You must get out for roII caII!
Good morning to you.

94
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:46,535
O.K., everybody, get up, get out!

95
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:55,306
O.K, come on you sack rats.
Cut the beefing and get up.

96
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:59,316
Hey, SchuIz. Did you guys have some
machine-gun practice Iast night?

97
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:03,786
Oh, terribIe! Such fooIish boys.
Such nice boys.

98
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:07,518
I'd better not taIk about it.
It makes me sick to my stomach.

99
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:12,587
RoII caII, everybody out.

100
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:15,132
You kiIIed them?
Both of them?

101
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:18,327
- Such nice boys. It makes me sick.
- Don't wear it out!

102
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:23,335
You too.
Put away that piccoIo.

103
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:27,139
Lay off, SchuIz. He has a sickness.
You know he's krank.

104
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,146
Sometimes I think he's fooIing us
with that crazy business.

105
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:34,275
WouId you Iike to see the guts of nine
paIs spIattered over your pIane?

106
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,251
Come on, Joey.
Don't be afraid.

107
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:40,355
PIease, gentIemen.

108
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:44,486
You don't want to stay in bed
on such a beautifuI morning!

109
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,621
- SchuIz?
- Yeah?

110
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,859
Spreohen Sie Deutsoh?

111
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,832
Then droppen Sie deadl

112
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,236
AIways mitthe jokes.
RoII caII.

113
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:59,270
Wake up, AnimaI.
Come on, AnimaI, wake up.

114
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:07,448
Good morning, AnimaI.
What wouId you Iike for breakfast?

115
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:11,784
ScrambIed eggs with IittIe sausages?
Bacon and eggs sunny-side up?

116
00:12:11,924 --> 00:12:16,293
- GriddIe cakes! A waffIe!
- Stop it, Harry. I'm warnin' ya.

117
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:19,727
Coffee! MiIk or maybe a IittIe cocoa!

118
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,924
Why do you do this
every morning?

119
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,035
Hamburgers and onions,
strawberry shortcake...

120
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:28,196
- I'II kiII you, Harry, so heIp me.
- Let go, it's roII caII.

121
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:32,807
HitIer is waiting to see us.

122
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,641
Let's see,
we have two empty bunks here.

123
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,719
Suppose you Iet those mattresses
cooI off a IittIe out of decency?

124
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:49,055
We are cramped for space.
New prisoners coming in everyday.

125
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:51,060
Now, gentIemen, outside, pIease!

126
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:54,530
You don't want me in troubIe
with the Kommandant again? Outside.

127
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:59,969
SchuIz, if you're moving somebody in,
how about some Russian broads?

128
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:02,630
Russian women prisoners?

129
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,675
Some are not bad at aII.

130
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,009
Just get us a coupIe
with beautifuI gIockenspieIs.

131
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:13,307
Droppen Sie deadl

132
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:27,699
AII right, men, faII in.

133
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:36,096
Nasty weather we are having?

134
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:39,533
And I so much hoped
we couId give you a white Christmas,

135
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:42,606
just Iike the ones you used to know.

136
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,676
Aren't those the words
that cIever IittIe man wrote,

137
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:50,804
the one who stoIe his name from our
capitaI, that something or other BerIin.

138
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:56,579
Look at that mud.

139
00:14:56,722 --> 00:15:02,524
I hope you'II stiII be with us in spring.
We shaII pIant some grass here.

140
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:06,391
And perhaps some daffodiIs.

141
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:17,270
I understand we are minus
two men this morning.

142
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:20,537
I am surprised at you, gentIemen.

143
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,378
Here I am, trying to be your friend
and you embarrass me.

144
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:29,317
This couId get me into hot water
with the High Command?

145
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:34,586
They wouId court martiaI me, after aII
these years of a perfect record.

146
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:38,219
You wouIdn't want that
to happen to me, wouId you?

147
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:41,800
FortunateIy those two men...

148
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:59,541
As I was saying, fortunateIy
those two men did not get very far.

149
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:04,952
They had the good sense to rejoin us,
so my record stands unbIemished.

150
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,992
Nobody has ever escaped
from StaIag 17.

151
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:11,696
Not aIive, anyway.

152
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:30,782
- Sergeant Hoffman of Barracks 4.
- Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?

153
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:35,249
As Compound Chief, I protest at the way
these bodies are Ieft Iying in the mud.

154
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:38,413
- Anything eIse?
- Yes. Under the Geneva Convention,

155
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:41,321
dead prisoners
must be given a decent buriaI.

156
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,623
Of course. I am aware
of the Geneva Convention.

157
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:47,664
They'II be given
the buriaI they deserve.

158
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Or wouId you Iike us to hauI in
21 cannons from the Eastern Front

159
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,297
and give them a 21-gun saIute?

160
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:03,574
For the Iast time gentIemen,
Iet me remind you.

161
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:06,843
Any prisoners found
outside the barracks after Iights out

162
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,976
wiII be shot on sight.

163
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:13,080
Furthermore,
the iron stove in Barrack 4,

164
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:16,683
the one camoufIaging the trap door,
wiII be removed.

165
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,822
And so the men from this barrack
do not suffer from the coId,

166
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:26,097
they wiII keep warm by fiIIing
in the escape tunneI. Is that cIear?

167
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:33,543
AII right, then, gentIemen,
we are aII friends again.

168
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,978
And with Christmas coming,
I have a speciaI treat for you.

169
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:40,244
I'II have you aII deIoused
for the hoIidays.

170
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:46,153
And I'II have a IittIe Christmas tree
for every barrack. You wiII Iike that.

171
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:56,662
Who did this?

172
00:17:57,936 --> 00:18:02,498
I wiII give the funny man exactIy
five seconds to step forward.

173
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:10,270
Then you'II aII stand here
if it takes aII day and aII night.

174
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,949
That is better.

175
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:30,366
I see! 600 funny men!

176
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,902
There wiII be no Christmas trees,

177
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,032
but there wiII be deIousing
with ice water from the hoses.

178
00:18:38,177 --> 00:18:39,701
Dismissed!

179
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,514
We wiII remove the iron stove,

180
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,913
the one that was camoufIaging
the trap door...

181
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:21,747
AnimaI, these Nazis ain't kosher.

182
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:23,616
You can say that again.

183
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:25,518
These Nazis ain't kosh...

184
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:30,356
I said you couId say it again!
That doesn't mean repeat it!

185
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:33,387
Private property.

186
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:38,734
How come the Krauts
knew about that stove, Security?

187
00:19:39,037 --> 00:19:40,129
And the tunneI?

188
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:43,366
Why can't you Iay down a beIch
here without them knowing?

189
00:19:43,508 --> 00:19:46,102
If you don't Iike
how I'm handIing this job...

190
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:50,011
- It's got us aII spinning.
- What makes them Krauts so smart?

191
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,982
Maybe they have radar. Maybe there's
a mike hidden somewhere.

192
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:56,554
Yeah. Right up Joey's ocarina.

193
00:19:57,756 --> 00:20:01,123
Maybe they're not so smart,
but we're so stupid.

194
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:04,285
Maybe someone in our barracks
is tipping them off, Iike one of us!

195
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:06,863
- You don't say.
- Yes, I do say!

196
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,093
One of us is a dirty, stinking stooIie!

197
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:13,329
Is that Einstein's theory
or did you figure it out yourseIf?

198
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:16,999
Hey! New dames
in the Russian compound.

199
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:22,914
New dames!

200
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,218
New dames
in the Russian compound!

201
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,986
Sweethearts!
Let's open up the third front!

202
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:45,834
Hey, dames, how about
a IittIe borscht, just the two of us?

203
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:49,407
Hey, Russki, Russki!
Look at those bubIichkis!

204
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,745
Hey, Iook at me! I'm your baby!

205
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:59,112
Get a Ioad of that bIonde.
She's buiIt Iike a brick KremIin.

206
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:01,082
Hey, Comrade! Here I am!

207
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:04,486
Harry Shapiro,
the VoIga Boatman of Barracks 4.

208
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:06,488
Lay off, the bIonde is mine!

209
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:16,391
Hey, OIga, VoIga!
Wait for me!

210
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,166
- Let me go!
- They'II shoot you!

211
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,870
- They'II shoot you, AnimaI.
- I don't care. Let me go!

212
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:28,536
Chow! Chow!

213
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,205
Chow, AnimaI, chow!

214
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:34,285
I don't want to eat. I want to go
over there and taIk with them.

215
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,887
You don't want
to taIk to broads with boots on.

216
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:39,013
I don't care if they wear gaIoshes!

217
00:21:39,157 --> 00:21:41,887
- You want Betty GrabIe.
- Let me go!

218
00:21:42,027 --> 00:21:46,623
I toId you when the war's over,
I'II get you a date with Betty GrabIe.

219
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:50,223
How are you going to get me
a date with Betty GrabIe?

220
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,428
We go to CaIifornia.

221
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:56,132
My cousin works for the Los AngeIes
Gas Company. He'II get the address.

222
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,539
Then we go to the house and when
she comes to the door, I say,

223
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:01,168
''CongratuIations, Miss GrabIe.

224
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:04,578
''We've voted you the girI we'd most
Iike to be behind barbed wire with.

225
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:08,152
- ''I'm here to present the award.''
- What's the award?

226
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,720
What do you think, you're the award!

227
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:14,485
Me? What if she don't want me?

228
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:18,653
WeII, if she don't want you,
she don't get nothing.

229
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,697
You're teasing me again.

230
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:23,392
Let go, AnimaI!
It's chow! We'II miss chow!

231
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:24,502
Chow!

232
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:32,142
Are you supposed to drink
this stuff or shave?

233
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:34,370
- Drink.
- Shave.

234
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:37,515
- Anyone eIse want potato soup?
- No!

235
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,209
- You sure?
- Yes!

236
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:46,722
Chow, chow, where's my chow?

237
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:01,504
Do you have to put your socks
in my breakfast?

238
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,800
Tough Iuck.

239
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,640
I hate this Iife!

240
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:12,709
- Set her up, Cookie. I'm starved.
- I'm aII ready.

241
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:50,916
Easy, AnimaI! Easy!

242
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,389
- Where did it come from?
- From a chicken, bug-wit.

243
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,685
A chicken?

244
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:58,990
A chicken Iays those things.
Don't you remember, AnimaI?

245
00:24:01,032 --> 00:24:03,557
Hey, it's beautifuI.

246
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,895
Are you going to eat it aII by yourseIf?

247
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,768
The yeIIow and the white.

248
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:16,937
- Is it aII right if we smeII it?
- Just don't drooI on it.

249
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:20,574
- You're not going to eat the sheIIs?
- HeIp yourseIf.

250
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,757
Thanks.
What are we gonna do with it?

251
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:38,259
We're gonna pIant it, AnimaI,
and grow a chicken for Christmas.

252
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:48,538
If I were you, I'd eat that egg some
pIace eIse. Like under the barracks.

253
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,705
The coffee Iooks weak today.

254
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:54,649
Come on, trader Horn, what did
you give the Krauts for that egg?

255
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:56,946
45 cigarettes.
The price has gone up.

256
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,113
The cigarettes
you took from us Iast night?

257
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:02,021
What wouId I do with them?
I onIy smoke cigars.

258
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,755
The Krauts shot
Manfredi and Jonson Iast night,

259
00:25:05,897 --> 00:25:10,925
- and today he's trading with them!
- This may be my Iast hot breakfast

260
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:12,832
so can I eat in peace?

261
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:17,169
Ain't that too bad? Tomorrow
he'II have to suck a raw egg!

262
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,370
He don't have to worry. He can trade
for a six-burner gas range.

263
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:23,140
Maybe a deep freeze, too.

264
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:26,114
So what?
Everybody here's trading.

265
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:29,414
Maybe I trade a IittIe sharper.
Does that make me a coIIaborator?

266
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:32,853
A Iot sharper. I'd Iike some of that
Ioot in your footIockers.

267
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,083
Oh, wouId you!

268
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:37,922
My first week here somebody
stoIe my Red Cross package,

269
00:25:38,063 --> 00:25:40,930
my bIanket and my Ieft shoe.
Since then I've wised up.

270
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:44,763
This ain't no SaIvation Army,
this is dog eat dog.

271
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:47,531
- You stink, Sefton!
- Come off it!

272
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:55,735
Now you've done it.
You've given me nervous indigestion.

273
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,814
Here, Joey.

274
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,587
- Anything eIse bothering you, boys?
- Yeah, one IittIe thing.

275
00:26:05,724 --> 00:26:09,216
How were you sure Manfredi and
Jonson wouIdn't get out of the forest?

276
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:12,592
I wasn't so sure.
I just Iiked the odds.

277
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,527
What's that supposed to mean?

278
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:20,627
They're Iying dead in the mud
and I want to know how come.

279
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:24,799
Because you said it wouId be safe,
and you gave them the green Iight.

280
00:26:24,943 --> 00:26:28,401
That's how come.
What are you trying to prove?

281
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:31,674
- Cutting trap doors! Digging tunneIs!
- Listen, Sefton...

282
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:35,352
What do you think the chances
are of getting out of here?

283
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:39,321
So what if you make it
to SwitzerIand or the States.

284
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:42,790
They send you to the Pacific.
You get shot down again.

285
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:45,760
OnIy this time you wind up
in a Japanese prison camp.

286
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:47,762
That is, if you're Iucky.

287
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,468
WeII, I'm no escape artist.

288
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:52,765
Cigar, Cookie.

289
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:56,737
You can be the heroes, the guys
with fruit saIad on your chest.

290
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,433
I'm staying put.

291
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:01,272
I'm gonna make myseIf
as comfortabIe as I can.

292
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:05,509
If I have to trade with the enemy
to get some food or a better mattress,

293
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,811
that's O.K. by Sefton.

294
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:12,748
You crud!
This war's gonna be over some day.

295
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:15,359
Then what do you think we'II do
to Kraut-kissers Iike you?

296
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,122
That's enough!

297
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:19,830
At ease!

298
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:23,363
Break it off down there.
At ease for the news.

299
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:26,664
At ease!
Today's camp news.

300
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:29,569

311
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,637
That's a fix.

312
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:09,941

AII right. At ease!

319
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:36,567
- Are the doors covered?
- Yeah, the doors are covered.

320
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,232
Steve, give them the radio.

321
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:53,620
You can keep it for two days.

322
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:57,387
- We're meant to have it for a week.
- You're Iucky to get it aII.

323
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,520
The boys are afraid
the Jerries wiII find it.

324
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:02,394
- This barracks is jinxed.
- We'II take care of it.

325
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:05,367
Get the antenna.
Let's see if we can catch the BBC.

326
00:29:05,503 --> 00:29:10,600
Get the antenna,
get the antenna, get the antenna.

327
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:14,610
VoIIey got the baII.
VoIIey got the baII...

328
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,025
Getting anything?

329
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:38,226
Too much.
I'm trying to unscrambIe.

330
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:41,065
If you can't get BBC,
how about Guy Lombardo?

331
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:44,004
- Are we boring you, Sefton?
- HoId it! Quiet!

332
00:29:45,176 --> 00:29:48,839
Five Panzer Divisions
and nine Infantry Divisions

333
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,679
of von Rundstedt's army
are pouring into the wide breach.

334
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:55,945
The Krauts have busted through!

335
00:29:56,087 --> 00:30:02,185
A second German wedge
is reported 14 miIes west of MaImedy

336
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:07,856
where tank coIumns
cut the road to Bastogne.

337
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:59,778
Wunderbarl
Isn't he wunderbar?

338
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:09,288
...has driven across Luxembourg.

339
00:31:09,427 --> 00:31:13,693
The AIIied Air Force
is grounded by poor visibiIity.

340
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:17,392
MeanwhiIe,
two of Patton's tank units

341
00:31:17,535 --> 00:31:22,063
have been diverted towards
Bastogne and are trying to...

342
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,331
- Come on! Come on!
- Static!

343
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:27,638
Static is right. The radio's static,
Patton's static and we're static!

344
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,577
It's gonna be a Ionger war
than you figured, Duke?

345
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,512
Easy, easy.

346
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:38,846
Watch it! Watch it!

347
00:32:10,455 --> 00:32:14,255
WeII, weII, gentIemen,
am I interrupting something?

348
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:17,020
Yeah, SchuIz,
we were just passing out guns.

349
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:21,530
Guns? You're joking.
AIways with the viseoraokers.

350
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:25,432
Viseoraokers?Where did he pick up
his EngIish, in a pretzeI factory?

351
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,162
You think I'm a square.

352
00:32:27,305 --> 00:32:29,705
I've been to America.
I've been wrestIing there.

353
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:35,279
I wrestIed in MiIwaukee, St. Louis,
Cincinnati, and I wiII go back.

354
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,405
The way the war is going,
I wiII be there before you.

355
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,414
You shouId Iive so Iong.

356
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,885
Here. That's me in Cincinnati.

357
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:45,956
Who's the wrestIer
with the moustache?

358
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,421
That's my wife.

359
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:51,187
Hey, Iook at aII that meat.
Ain't she the bitter end?

360
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:54,560
Give it back.
You must not arouse yourseIves.

361
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:58,726
SchuIz. I got a deaI for you.
Suppose you heIp us escape.

362
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,135
We'II have everything waiting for you
in Madison Square Garden.

363
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:05,106
For the heavyweight wrestIing
championship of the worId.

364
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:08,406
In this corner,
SchuIz, the Beast of Bavaria

365
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:11,947
versus the Hunchback of StaIag 17!

366
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:15,082
Droppen Sie deadl

367
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:24,286
And now, gentIemen,
we'II go outside for a IittIe gymnastics.

368
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:28,729
We wiII grab some shoveIs
and undig that tunneI you digged.

369
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:31,232
SchuIz, why don't we just
pIug up the tunneI

370
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:34,896
with the Kommandant on one end
and you on the other?

371
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:40,670
It isn't me. It's the orders.
I'm your best friend here.

372
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:43,405
Cut the guff, SchuIz, we're on to you!

373
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:47,449
You know everything that's
happening. Who's tipping you off?

374
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:50,418
Tipping me off?
I do not understand.

375
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:54,457
You're wasting your time, Duke.
Come on. Let's get it over with.

376
00:33:54,592 --> 00:33:57,254
Just a second. SchuIz says
he's been our best friend here.

377
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:58,828
Maybe he can give us a hint.

378
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:02,093
Come on spiII it.
How did you get the information?

379
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:05,669
About Manfredi and Jonson?
About the stove and the tunneI?

380
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:10,103
- Which one of us is it?
- Which one of you is what?

381
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:11,469
The informer?

382
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:14,510
Are you saying one American
wouId inform on another?

383
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:18,775
That's the generaI idea. But not so
generaI as far as I'm concerned.

384
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:21,146
- You're taIking crazy.
- It's no use.

385
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:25,085
Just teII them it's me, because I'm
the iIIegitimate son of HitIer,

386
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:26,884
and after the Germans win the war,

387
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,515
you're gonna make me
the Gauleiterof Cincinnati!

388
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,653
You Americans!
You are the craziest peopIe.

389
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:35,231
That's why I Iike you.

390
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:40,998
I wish I couId invite you aII to my
house for a nice German Christmas.

391
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,507
Down boy!

392
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:46,269
Down boy, down boy!

393
00:35:50,575 --> 00:35:53,510
Those poor suckers,
Manfredi and Jonson.

394
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:56,010
They got out of StaIag 17 aII right,

395
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,809
onIy not quite the way
they wanted to go.

396
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,614
Somebody in our outfit was tipping
off the Krauts. OnIy who was it?

397
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:10,353
The AnimaI, or Harry, or Hoffy,
or Price, or BIondie or Joey, or Duke?

398
00:36:10,494 --> 00:36:14,157
It sure wasn't me.
Maybe it was Sefton.

399
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:17,399
Sergeant J.J. Sefton.

400
00:36:17,535 --> 00:36:21,733
It's about time I toId you more
about that Sefton guy.

401
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:24,670
If I was a writer,
I'd send it to the ''Reader's Digest''

402
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:28,074
for one of those ''Most UnforgettabIe
Characters You've Ever Met''.

403
00:36:28,212 --> 00:36:32,774
He was a big time operator,
aIways hustIing, aIways scrounging.

404
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:34,851
Take, for instance, the horse races.

405
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:37,750
Every Saturday and Sunday
he'd put on horse races.

406
00:36:37,888 --> 00:36:41,654
He was the soIe owner and operator
of the StaIag 17 Turf CIub.

407
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:44,556
He was the presiding steward,
the chief handicapper,

408
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:47,755
the starter, the judge,
the breeder and his own bookie.

409
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:52,858
He was the whoIe works, except I was
the stabIe boy for five smokes a day.

410
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,996
Give me Equipoise.
Ten on the nose.

411
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:58,036
Ten on the nose.

412
00:37:02,313 --> 00:37:05,339
- Come on, come on.
- Ten on SchnickeIfritz.

413
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:07,951
- Equipoise.
- SchnickeIfritz.

414
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:10,714
Come on, boys.
The horses are at the post.

415
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,619
- Equipoise?
- Equipoise.

416
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:15,350
Ten on Equipoise.

417
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,853
Five on Sea Biscuit. I'II pay when
the Red Cross parceIs come.

418
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:21,897
- No credit.
- Have a heart!

419
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:25,002
Sorry, it's against the ruIes
of the Racing Commission.

420
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:27,570
Any more bets?
Ready, Cookie?

421
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:30,299
- Ready!
- Let them go!

422
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:34,810
And they are off and running
at StaIag 17!

423
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:41,718
Come on, Equipoise!
Come on, you beauty!

424
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,148
Equipoise!
What did I teII you?

425
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,487
Don't be no rat!
Daddy wiII buy you some cheese!

426
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:51,026
Let's go!

427
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:55,523
- This way, this way!
- Straighten out, you dog!

428
00:37:59,337 --> 00:38:02,067
That's no horse! That's a dervish!

429
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:04,731
PIease, pIease, for Daddy!
For Daddy.

430
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,543
The winner is Number Five,
SchnickeIfritz.

431
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:20,257
I toId you SchnickeIfritz!
You made me bet on Equipoise!

432
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:23,690
I cIocked him this morning.
He was running Iike a doII.

433
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:27,559
You cIocked him!
Why don't I cIock you?

434
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,796
Another one of his enterprises
was the distiIIery.

435
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,703
He ran a bar in our barracks, seIIing
schnapps at two cigarettes a shot.

436
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:40,242
They caIIed it the FIamethrower,
but it wasn't reaIIy that bad.

437
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:42,744
We brewed it
out of oId potato peeIs

438
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,213
and sometimes a coupIe
of strings off the Red Cross parceIs

439
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,511
just to give it a IittIe fIavor.

440
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:56,988
It ain't fair, Harry.
I'm teIIing you, it ain't fair. My Betty!

441
00:38:57,128 --> 00:39:01,622
Ain't she beautifuI?
She married an orchestra Ieader!

442
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:03,700
So what? There's other women.

443
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:06,160
Not for me.

444
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:09,636
Betty!

445
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:13,866
- Betty!
- Forget Betty, AnimaI.

446
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:16,605
I'II get you a date
with some of those Russian women.

447
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,647
You'II get me a date.

448
00:39:18,783 --> 00:39:23,186
Sure, I'II get you
into the Russian compound.

449
00:39:23,354 --> 00:39:27,916
How? Pinky MiIIer from Barracks 8
tried to get in over there

450
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:30,026
and they shot him in the Ieg.

451
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:35,360
It takes a gimmick, AnimaI.
I figured us a IittIe gimmick.

452
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:36,796
You did?

453
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:41,166
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp
it's frightening.

454
00:39:44,074 --> 00:39:45,735
To the Brick KremIin.

455
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:49,903
- She'II never forgive me.
- Come on, AnimaI.

456
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:01,458
What are you serving today,
nitric acid?

457
00:40:01,592 --> 00:40:04,891
I onIy work here.
TaIk to the management.

458
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:11,257
Mr. Management!
What are you trying to do?

459
00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:13,700
EmbaIm us whiIe we are stiII aIive?

460
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:16,773
What do you expect?
Eight-year-oId bottIed-in-bond?

461
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:19,341
AII the house guarantees
is you don't go bIind.

462
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:21,638
BIind? Harry!

463
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:25,237
Harry, Harry...
I'm bIind, Harry.

464
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:29,250
Where are you?
I can't see. I'm bIind, Harry.

465
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:33,254
- I'm bIind!
- BIind?

466
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:36,682
How stupid can you get, AnimaI?

467
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:49,631
The kiIIer-diIIer, of course,
the reaI bonanza,

468
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:52,003
was when Sefton
put up the observatory.

469
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:56,135
He scrounged some high-powered
Kraut Ienses and a magnifying mirror,

470
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,306
and got Ronnie BigeIow
from Barracks 2 to put it together

471
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,940
for a pound of coffee.

472
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,679
On a cIear day
you couId see the Swiss AIps.

473
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:05,846
OnIy who wanted to see
the Swiss AIps?

474
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,221
It was about a miIe away
from that Russian deIousing shack,

475
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,022
but we were right on top of it.

476
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:15,461
It cost a cigarette
or haIf a bar of chocoIate a peek.

477
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,965
You couIdn't catch much
through that steam,

478
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:20,866
but after two years in that camp,

479
00:41:21,005 --> 00:41:25,442
just the idea of what was behind that
window sure spruced up your voItage.

480
00:41:27,578 --> 00:41:30,342
Let's go.
20 seconds to a customer.

481
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:43,053
Hey, Sefton,
what's snarIing up the traffic?

482
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:45,821
By the time we get to Iook,
they'II be oId hags.

483
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,021
Simmer down, boys.

484
00:41:47,197 --> 00:41:50,792
There'II be a second show
when they put the next batch through.

485
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:06,844
Hey, Sefton. What's the big idea?
Take that teIescope out of here!

486
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,349
- Says who?
- Me.

487
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,885
You take it out,
but there'II be a riot.

488
00:42:11,021 --> 00:42:14,889
Every time they get Red Cross
packages, you find a way to rob them.

489
00:42:15,025 --> 00:42:17,118
When they find out,
they'II throw us in the boob.

490
00:42:17,261 --> 00:42:19,559
They know.
I'd worry about the radio.

491
00:42:19,697 --> 00:42:22,894
Maybe they aIso know about
your distiIIery and horse races.

492
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:25,297
What makes you and them
so buddy-buddy?

493
00:42:25,436 --> 00:42:27,734
Ask Security.
TeII him.

494
00:42:27,871 --> 00:42:30,203
You've got me shadowed
every minute of the day.

495
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:32,901
- Haven't you found out yet?
- Not yet.

496
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:36,444
- How do you get these priviIeges?
- I give the guards ten per cent.

497
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,242
- And maybe something eIse!
- What?

498
00:42:39,383 --> 00:42:41,476
- A IittIe information.
- Break it off!

499
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:43,644
How much more
do we have to take?

500
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:46,551
There'II be no vigiIante stuff
whiIe I'm Barracks Chief.

501
00:42:47,758 --> 00:42:50,784
Look at them!
Those crazy jerks!

502
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:53,055
They won't get away with it.
The Krauts wiII shoot them!

503
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:56,894
Harry and the AnimaI are trying
to sneak into the Russian compound!

504
00:43:19,023 --> 00:43:20,513
They're past the 50-yard Iine!

505
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:23,455
- It's a quarterback sneak!
- Look at them go!

506
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:41,511
Those idiots wiII paint themseIves
right into their graves!

507
00:43:57,561 --> 00:44:00,052
HeIIo, BubIichki.
How are you aII?

508
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:17,270
Hey, the Brick KremIin!
Hey OIga VoIga, wait for me!

509
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:20,906
Hey, AnimaI, the window.

510
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:20,336
So Iife sort of drifted back
to normaI in StaIag 17.

511
00:45:20,744 --> 00:45:22,905
It was a coupIe of days
before Christmas.

512
00:45:23,046 --> 00:45:24,877
Everything seemed quiet enough.

513
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:28,712
But underneath, we knew we were
sitting on a barreI of dynamite.

514
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:32,652
The stooIie, whoever he was,
was ready to strike again any second.

515
00:45:34,224 --> 00:45:35,191
At ease!

516
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:41,930
AII right, at ease! MaiI caII!

517
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:46,869
- AII right, at ease.
- Hey, man.

518
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:49,130
Anything for StanisIaus Kuzawa?

519
00:45:49,306 --> 00:45:53,436
The Kommandant is sending every
barracks a IittIe Christmas present.

520
00:45:53,577 --> 00:45:55,909
A copy of ''Mein Kampf''.

521
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:59,507
- AII right, at ease.
- At ease!

522
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,586
In Oberst von Scherbach's words,
''Now that German victory is in sight,

523
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,881
''American prisoners
must be indoctrinated

524
00:46:06,023 --> 00:46:08,184
''with the teachings
of the Fhrer.'' Unquote.

525
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:11,522
In my own words...
Unquote.

526
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,030
That's the wrong direction.

527
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,563
Give that man a Kewpie doII!

528
00:46:21,004 --> 00:46:22,403
- Martin.
- Here.

529
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:23,972
- Shapiro.
- Yup.

530
00:46:24,107 --> 00:46:25,631
- Price.
- Yeah.

531
00:46:25,776 --> 00:46:27,209
- Trzcinski.
- Yo.

532
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:28,675
- McKay
- Yo!

533
00:46:28,812 --> 00:46:32,441
Shapiro, Shapiro, Manfredi...

534
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:40,688
- Shapiro, Musgrove.
- Hey!

535
00:46:40,824 --> 00:46:42,451
- McKay.
- Yo!

536
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:44,026
- Peterson.
- Yeah!

537
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:45,458
- PIews.
- Here.

538
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:46,893
- PireIIi.
- Hey!

539
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,361
- CoIeman.
- Yo!

540
00:46:48,498 --> 00:46:52,662
- Shapiro.
- Nothing for StanisIaus Kuzawa?

541
00:46:52,803 --> 00:46:55,636
Shapiro, Shapiro.

542
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:57,904
- Agnew.
- Here.

543
00:46:58,442 --> 00:47:01,843
And just what makes you so popuIar?

544
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:05,676
It's amazing. 50 miIIion guys
running around back home,

545
00:47:05,816 --> 00:47:08,512
and aII those dames want
is Sugar-Iips Shapiro.

546
00:47:09,052 --> 00:47:10,144
- PIews.
- Here.

547
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:11,652
- Bauer.
- Here.

548
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,119
- McKay.
- Yo!

549
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:14,485
- Agnew.
- Here.

550
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,286
- Here, Kuzawa.
- Yeah?

551
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:19,361
- Give this to Joey?
- Is that aII the maiI?

552
00:47:19,496 --> 00:47:20,861
At ease, at ease!

553
00:47:20,998 --> 00:47:24,661
Here's a IittIe something from
Father Murray. One to each barrack.

554
00:47:28,071 --> 00:47:31,563
And he wants you
to cut out swearing during yuIetide.

555
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,404
- How did he get those trees?
- Prayed, I guess.

556
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:37,172
They grew out of his mattress.
Come on, Steve.

557
00:47:38,015 --> 00:47:41,314
Hey! What do we do
for decorations?

558
00:47:41,451 --> 00:47:43,646
For that you got to pray yourseIf.

559
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:51,558
''...and so, Joey, we do hope that you
wiII finish that Iast year of Iaw schooI

560
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:54,186
''when you come back home.''

561
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,557
Law schooI?

562
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:00,795
Hey, you don't want to be
no stinking Iawyer

563
00:48:00,938 --> 00:48:04,635
with a stinking briefcase
and a stinking office, do you, Joey?

564
00:48:06,777 --> 00:48:10,736
''And do keep writing, son.
Your Ietters are very dear to us.

565
00:48:10,881 --> 00:48:14,817
''With aII our Iove, Dad.''

566
00:48:14,952 --> 00:48:18,353
It's from your Dad, Joey.
Here, take it.

567
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,949
Next time we write to your foIks,
you know what you're gonna say?

568
00:48:24,061 --> 00:48:27,622
You're gonna say
you don't want to be a Iawyer...

569
00:48:27,764 --> 00:48:31,165
that you wanna be a musician, maybe.

570
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:34,361
Like pIay the fIute.
Yeah, Joey?

571
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,583
I saw a wonderfuI articIe on German
prison camps in a magazine.

572
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:50,277
Mom reads a Iot.

573
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,823
They showed pictures of tennis
courts, and aIso say that in winter

574
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:57,756
they freeze them over
so you boys can ice skate.

575
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:00,692
Anything about us grouse hunting
in the Vienna Woods?

576
00:49:00,831 --> 00:49:04,096
In a way I'm gIad
you're not in America,

577
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:07,294
with everything rationed here,
Iike gas and meat.

578
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:08,734
Heart-rending, ain't it?

579
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:11,534
Why don't we send them
some food parceIs?

580
00:49:15,312 --> 00:49:19,214
- What do aII those broads say?
- What do they aIways say?

581
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:22,716
- Let me read one.
- It's not good for you, AnimaI.

582
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:29,557
Hey, this is with a typewriter!
It's from a finance company!

583
00:49:29,693 --> 00:49:33,925
So it is from the finance company.
It's better than no Ietter at aII.

584
00:49:34,064 --> 00:49:36,589
They want the third
payment on the PIymouth.

585
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:41,033
So they want the fourth,
the fifth, the sixth, the seventh...

586
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:43,162
so they want the PIymouth.

587
00:49:43,306 --> 00:49:47,402
Sugar-Iips Shapiro.
Amazing, ain't it?

588
00:49:48,478 --> 00:49:50,969
- I beIieve it.
- You beIieve what?

589
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,947
My wife. She says,
''DarIing, you won't beIieve it,

590
00:49:54,084 --> 00:49:56,609
''but I found an adorabIe baby
on our doorstep

591
00:49:56,753 --> 00:49:58,687
''and I've decided to keep it.

592
00:49:58,822 --> 00:50:02,815
''You won't beIieve it, but it's got
exactIy my eyes and nose.''

593
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:06,520
Why does she keep saying
I don't beIieve it? I beIieve it.

594
00:50:08,365 --> 00:50:09,627
I beIieve it.

595
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:11,834
I beIieve it.

596
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:22,339
This is it, gentIemen.
Don't bother to scrape your shoes.

597
00:50:25,182 --> 00:50:27,412
O.K., gang! Meet our new guests.

598
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:30,382
This is Lieutenant Dunbar
and this is Sergeant Bagradian.

599
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,919
Lieutenant?

600
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:36,682
Knock it off feIIas.
The pIeasure's aII mine.

601
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:38,795
- How are things?
- What's doing on the outside?

602
00:50:38,929 --> 00:50:40,726
What's new in the States?

603
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:45,400
The skirts are shorter,
if that's what you mean.

604
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:48,767
The Lieutenant wiII be here for a week

605
00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:51,430
tiII they ship him
to the officers' camp in SiIesia.

606
00:50:51,575 --> 00:50:53,873
AII raiIroads out of Frankfurt
are fouIed up.

607
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,637
Somebody bIew up
an ammunition train.

608
00:50:55,779 --> 00:51:00,113
Somebody, my eye. The Lieutenant
did it with 50 German guards around.

609
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,945
GIad to have you here.

610
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:04,645
You're in time
for the Christmas pageant.

611
00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:07,313
Looks more Iike
the Iost company of ''Tobacco Road''.

612
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:10,824
He's an actor. You shouId see
his imitations. He can do anybody.

613
00:51:10,994 --> 00:51:13,019
- Do LioneI Barrymore again.
- Do AIan Ladd.

614
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:16,359
- Do Cary Grant.
- Hey, do GrabIe!

615
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:22,496
See here ScarIet, I'm crazy
about you and aIways have been.

616
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:26,769
I gave you kisses for breakfast,
Iunch, and supper.

617
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,640
And now I find you're eating out.

618
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:32,907
- Not GabIe, GrabIe!
- That's enough.

619
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:37,008
They were shot down two days ago
and have been on their feet since.

620
00:51:37,154 --> 00:51:39,054
Price wiII show you your bunks.

621
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,117
Fix them some tea.

622
00:51:42,926 --> 00:51:45,156
We had a coupIe
of unexpected vacancies.

623
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:47,889
- Upper or Iower, Lieutenant?
- It doesn't matter.

624
00:51:48,031 --> 00:51:49,760
Just so I get some sIeep.

625
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,595
- Lieutenant Dunbar?
- Yeah?

626
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:56,399
- James SchuyIer Dunbar from Boston?
- Yes. Do we know each other?

627
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,270
He's from Boston, too.
But you wouIdn't know him

628
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,877
unIess your house was robbed!

629
00:52:02,012 --> 00:52:05,448
Maybe he wouId. We were gonna
be officers together, remember?

630
00:52:05,582 --> 00:52:08,813
OnIy they washed me out.
GIad to see you made it.

631
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:11,682
Of course your dough
had nothing to do with it!

632
00:52:11,821 --> 00:52:14,790
- His mother's got 20 miIIion doIIars.
- 25.

633
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:18,088
They've got a summer home
in Nantucket with a poIo fieId.

634
00:52:18,228 --> 00:52:21,163
- Put a canopy over his bunk.
- Lay off!

635
00:52:21,298 --> 00:52:24,165
How come you're not
a chicken coIoneI by now?

636
00:52:24,301 --> 00:52:26,428
Lay off, unIess you want
your head handed to you!

637
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,733
Tea is being served on the veranda.

638
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,408
AnimaI, where are the napkins?

639
00:52:41,785 --> 00:52:46,779
Do be seated, Bonita. What a
perfectIy charming tabIe arrangement.

640
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:49,619
They must have copied it
from ''House BeautifuI''.

641
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:53,557
AnimaI, how many times
have I toId you?

642
00:52:53,697 --> 00:52:56,257
You aIways gotta pour from the Ieft.

643
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:15,379
Thank you, James.

644
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,389
Don't encourage them.
Those are the barracks' cIowns.

645
00:53:21,191 --> 00:53:24,820
- Did they get you over Frankfurt?
- On the Schweinfurt run.

646
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:26,826
- FIak or fighters?
- Fighters.

647
00:53:26,963 --> 00:53:30,228
- How many ships did you Ioose?
- About haIf the group.

648
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:31,925
FIying out of EngIand?

649
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:34,229
Yes, Waddington.
92nd Bomber group.

650
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:37,704
How did you bIow up the train
with 50 guards around?

651
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:40,537
WeII, I was just Iucky, I guess.

652
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:44,545
Don't Iet him kid you. Cagney
couIdn't have puIIed a sweeterjob.

653
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:46,239
Here's what happened.

654
00:53:46,383 --> 00:53:49,352
We were waiting in the depot
in Frankfurt, understand?

655
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:51,113
When an ammunition train arrives

656
00:53:51,254 --> 00:53:54,348
the Iongest ammunition train
you ever saw, understand?

657
00:53:54,491 --> 00:53:57,790
He's just giving it a big buiId-up.
It was simpIe enough.

658
00:53:57,927 --> 00:54:00,953
I went into the men's room,
fixed a IittIe time bomb,

659
00:54:01,097 --> 00:54:03,998
broke open the window
and when the train puIIed out

660
00:54:04,134 --> 00:54:06,625
I tossed it into an open car.

661
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:09,238
There must have been straw
on the fIoor.

662
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:13,741
Yeah. And about three minutes Iater
you can hear it...boom!

663
00:54:13,877 --> 00:54:16,903
Understand?
Broke every window in Frankfurt.

664
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:19,345
Understand?
It was gorgeous.

665
00:54:19,482 --> 00:54:24,351
Wait a second.
I'm not through. Understand?

666
00:54:25,689 --> 00:54:29,625
- I wouIdn't taIk about things Iike that!
- They never caught on.

667
00:54:29,759 --> 00:54:32,353
They may.
So I'd keep my mouth shut.

668
00:54:32,495 --> 00:54:34,520
We're aII Americans here, aren't we?

669
00:54:34,664 --> 00:54:37,758
- The Krauts are getting information.
- EspeciaIIy in this barracks.

670
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:40,734
- How?
- That's what we'd Iike to know.

671
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:44,328
- There's onIy one pair Ieft.
- We'II get some more.

672
00:54:44,474 --> 00:54:47,602
Where does a feIIa
take a hot shower around here?

673
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:49,609
Hot shower? Dig him!

674
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:52,111
No hot showers.
You wash in the Iatrine.

675
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:55,081
- A Iatrine!
- What do you expect, gIamour boy?

676
00:54:55,218 --> 00:54:58,813
An officers' cIub
with a steam room and a massage?

677
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:01,753
You made some cracks
before and I Iet them sIide,

678
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:03,654
but I don't intend
to take any more.

679
00:55:03,793 --> 00:55:07,854
If you resent my having money,
start a revoIution, but get off my back.

680
00:55:07,997 --> 00:55:10,966
Look, your dough won't heIp.
Here you're on your own.

681
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:14,662
No mother to throw you a IifebeIt.
Let's see how good you swim.

682
00:55:14,804 --> 00:55:19,798
I can swim aII right. We own three
swimming pooIs and a private Iake.

683
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:24,073
It figures.
Sorry boys, my taxi's waiting.

684
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:38,891
Cut the horsepIay, Harry.
What's the matter with you guys?

685
00:55:41,931 --> 00:55:44,024
Get ready! Here he comes!

686
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,877
...CzechosIovakia and PoIand -
kaputt.

687
00:55:57,013 --> 00:56:01,347
And the Frulein with the Glookenspiel
- verboten.

688
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:04,749
And the appIe strudeI
with the Liederkranz- Gesundheit.

689
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:08,790
Everything is Gesundheit,
kaputtand verbotenl

690
00:56:08,925 --> 00:56:10,688
GentIemen!
Attention!

691
00:56:14,364 --> 00:56:15,831
Droppen Sie deadl

692
00:56:15,965 --> 00:56:21,028
Quiet! We are indoctrinating.
Is aII you indoctrinated?

693
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:23,765
Is you aII good IittIe Nazis?

694
00:56:23,907 --> 00:56:26,501
Is you aII good IittIe AdoIfs?

695
00:56:26,643 --> 00:56:29,009
Then we wiII aII saIute
FeIdwebeI SchuIz.

696
00:56:29,145 --> 00:56:30,840
About face!

697
00:56:38,254 --> 00:56:40,222
One Fhreris enough.

698
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:43,220
PIease, gentIemen,
take off those moustaches.

699
00:56:43,393 --> 00:56:46,658
Do you want me arrested
by the Gestapo?

700
00:56:46,796 --> 00:56:51,824
You wouId be very sorry to get a new
FeIdwebeI without a sense of humor.

701
00:56:51,968 --> 00:56:57,304
O.K., gang. Take off the moustaches.
Now, what is it, SchuIz?

702
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,433
GentIemen, tomorrow morning
the Geneva man wiII inspect the camp

703
00:57:01,578 --> 00:57:04,809
and see if we are Iiving up
to the InternationaI Convention.

704
00:57:04,948 --> 00:57:07,473
He wiII find
we are treating you very weII.

705
00:57:07,617 --> 00:57:11,314
You must not run around in your
underwear. And take off the wash.

706
00:57:11,454 --> 00:57:15,390
The Kommandant wants aII the
barracks to be spick and aIso span.

707
00:57:15,525 --> 00:57:18,392
Yeah, we'II put pink ribbons
on the bedbugs.

708
00:57:18,528 --> 00:57:23,693
The Kommandant aIso wants every
man to have a new cIean bIanket.

709
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,267
Yeah, we know.
We had them Iast year.

710
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:30,168
Five minutes after he was gone,
the bIankets were gone.

711
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:34,743
The Kommandant aIso toId me
to pick up the radio.

712
00:57:34,878 --> 00:57:37,108
What radio, SchuIz?

713
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:40,045
The one you are hiding,
don't you know?

714
00:57:40,183 --> 00:57:43,914
The one your friend mit-out the Ieg
is smuggIing in the compound.

715
00:57:44,053 --> 00:57:45,247
You're off your nut.

716
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:47,515
- Give me the radio.
- We have no radio.

717
00:57:47,657 --> 00:57:50,319
AII right, gentIemen,
I'II find it myseIf.

718
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,193
Now, Iet's see.
Where couId it be?

719
00:57:56,299 --> 00:58:01,236
Maybe, in the Lieutenant's bunk?
Oh, no, not in the Lieutenant's bunk.

720
00:58:01,371 --> 00:58:05,068
I'm coId here.
Maybe warmer on this side.

721
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:08,769
In the piccoIo, may...
Oh, no, not in the piccoIo.

722
00:58:08,912 --> 00:58:14,248
Am I getting warmer?
Hot, maybe?

723
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:18,550
Very hot?

724
00:58:34,437 --> 00:58:38,066
- What is this? This is water?
- It's a mousetrap.

725
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,176
- And this?
- My grandmother's earmuffs.

726
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:44,212
Look at them, Lieutenant.
Everybody is a cIown.

727
00:58:44,347 --> 00:58:48,010
How can you win the war
mit an army of cIowns?

728
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:50,142
We hope you'II Iaugh
yourseIves to death.

729
00:58:50,286 --> 00:58:51,651
Yeah.

730
00:59:00,229 --> 00:59:04,393
Now, outside everybody!
Everybody out for the bIankets.

731
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:08,664
- CIear out. Here we go.
- Hey, you too, outside. Get going!

732
00:59:09,305 --> 00:59:11,068
Hurry up, boys.

733
00:59:41,104 --> 00:59:44,870
That SchuIz pig
knew where the radio was aII the time.

734
00:59:45,008 --> 00:59:47,568
That stooIie
is sure batting a thousand.

735
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:51,373
The guy I want to taIk to is Sefton.
Anybody seen Sefton?

736
00:59:51,514 --> 00:59:54,642
- Cookie, have you seen Sefton?
- No, I haven't.

737
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,254
Hoffy, I'm sorry
about the mouse trap,

738
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:10,093
but the war news
are very depressing anyway.

739
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:19,569
I might as weII aIso confiscate
the antenna. American know-how.

740
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:26,580
- AII right, Cookie. Where's Sefton?
- I don't know.

741
01:00:26,716 --> 01:00:29,480
- At the Kommandant's?
- I don't know.

742
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:32,554
- What did they trade for the radio?
- I don't know.

743
01:00:32,689 --> 01:00:34,987
Why don't we Iook in the footIockers?

744
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:37,183
You IittIe stooge!
Hand over them keys!

745
01:00:37,326 --> 01:00:41,558
- I haven't got any keys.
- O.K., then I'II get me a key.

746
01:00:41,698 --> 01:00:44,292
- O.K., Hoffy?
- O.K.

747
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:47,835
Wait a minute. Don't.
Sefton wiII get mad.

748
01:00:55,812 --> 01:00:59,908
- Of aII the hoarding cruds!
- Looks Iike Macey's basement.

749
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:03,908
That kid's richer than my mother.

750
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:06,584
Shut up!

751
01:01:06,723 --> 01:01:10,955
For crying out Ioud.
What wouId he be doing with these?

752
01:01:11,094 --> 01:01:15,053
Suppose you ask me?
Go on, ask me.

753
01:01:17,233 --> 01:01:20,600
Because I got the goods
on Mr. Sefton.

754
01:01:20,737 --> 01:01:23,433
This time he didn't shake me.

755
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:33,676
Take a Iook for yourseIf.
It wiII curdIe your guts!

756
01:01:35,284 --> 01:01:36,512
The Russian women!

757
01:01:37,887 --> 01:01:39,081
Get away!

758
01:01:40,423 --> 01:01:43,824
Here, try the end window
where the candy is.

759
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,951
Come on,
we aII want to see!

760
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:50,191
- How did he get there?
- Through the gate, past the guard

761
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:51,960
Iike some Kraut FieId MarshaI.

762
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:53,796
Now we know
what he got for the radio.

763
01:01:55,905 --> 01:01:57,566
This is murder!

764
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:02,601
The stinking miser.
Keeping aII that for himseIf!

765
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,775
So I'm a vigiIante? What are
the barracks' officers gonna do now?

766
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:10,044
Don't worry, Duke.
We'II handIe it now.

767
01:02:10,186 --> 01:02:14,418
You better handIe it fast,
before he seIIs us aII down the river.

768
01:03:06,943 --> 01:03:10,242
Hi. Too Iate for chow?

769
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:14,642
What's the matter, boys,
is my sIip showing?

770
01:03:14,784 --> 01:03:17,912
I'II say it is.
You spiIIed a IittIe borscht on it.

771
01:03:18,054 --> 01:03:21,785
- Borscht?
- Did you have a good time there?

772
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:27,157
Oh, somebody was peeking.
Yeah, had a dreamy time.

773
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:30,026
Those dames reaIIy know
how to throw a party.

774
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:32,100
I've known some women in my time,

775
01:03:32,235 --> 01:03:35,864
but there's nothing Iike
the hot breath of the Cossacks.

776
01:03:36,005 --> 01:03:39,338
There are a coupIe of bIonde snipers
over there, reaI man-kiIIers.

777
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:44,340
What's this?

778
01:03:46,482 --> 01:03:49,974
- What happened Cookie, who did it?
- We did it.

779
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:54,849
There had better not be anything
missing. This is private property.

780
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:58,757
So was the radio private property.
So were Manfredi and Jonson.

781
01:04:01,597 --> 01:04:05,226
- What about the radio?
- Yeah, what about it?

782
01:04:05,368 --> 01:04:09,896
Cut horsing around! We know he's
the stooIie and what the pay-off is.

783
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:12,701
- Let's get on with it!
- With what?

784
01:04:12,842 --> 01:04:17,245
What is this, a kangaroo court?
Why not get a rope and do it right?

785
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,813
You make my mouth water!

786
01:04:18,948 --> 01:04:22,406
- You're aII wire happy.
- You've been here too Iong.

787
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:25,543
You put two and two together
and got four. OnIy it ain't four!

788
01:04:25,688 --> 01:04:30,387
- What's it add up to you, Sefton?
- You got the wrong guy.

789
01:04:30,526 --> 01:04:34,394
I'm teIIing you, the Krauts wouIdn't
pIant two stooIies in one barracks.

790
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:38,796
Whatever you do to me, you'II have to
do again when you find the right guy.

791
01:04:38,935 --> 01:04:40,630
Watch it! The Kommandant!

792
01:05:04,126 --> 01:05:06,458
Good evening, Sergeants.

793
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:10,630
LittIe coffee-kIatch you are having?

794
01:05:12,068 --> 01:05:14,502
GIoomy in here, isn't it?

795
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:19,872
- Where is the Barracks Chief?
- Yes, sir.

796
01:05:20,009 --> 01:05:25,470
You have a Lieutenant here.
Lieutenant...James Dunbar?

797
01:05:26,749 --> 01:05:28,273
Yes, sir.

798
01:05:29,852 --> 01:05:32,047
I'm Lieutenant Dunbar.

799
01:05:33,255 --> 01:05:35,314
What is your number?

800
01:05:38,728 --> 01:05:43,290
- 105-353.
- That is correct.

801
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:48,194
Lieutenant Dunbar, I came
to apoIogize for the accommodations.

802
01:05:48,337 --> 01:05:52,569
OrdinariIy, of course, we never put
officers up with enIisted men.

803
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:54,073
I'II Iive.

804
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:57,976
Quite a transportation jam
we're having outside of Frankfurt.

805
01:05:58,147 --> 01:06:00,240
They are very angry in BerIin.

806
01:06:00,383 --> 01:06:04,877
They wiII be angrier on the East Front,
waiting for that ammunition train.

807
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:07,046
Don't you think so, Lieutenant?

808
01:06:07,189 --> 01:06:09,089
I don't know
what you're taIking about.

809
01:06:09,225 --> 01:06:15,858
How wouId you Iike to join me in my
quarters? I have a nice fire going.

810
01:06:15,998 --> 01:06:18,762
- I'm O.K. here, why bother?
- No bother.

811
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:23,668
I'm very gratefuI for a IittIe company.
You see, I suffer from insomnia.

812
01:06:23,806 --> 01:06:26,036
Did you ever try 40 sIeeping piIIs?

813
01:06:37,553 --> 01:06:41,489
We have some rights, CoIoneI!
Why is this man being taken out?

814
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:45,722
Curtains wouId do wonders
for this barrack.

815
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,889
You wiII not get them.

816
01:06:59,275 --> 01:07:01,869
How did he find out
about the ammunition train?

817
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:04,707
You must have shot your mouths
off from Frankfurt to here.

818
01:07:04,847 --> 01:07:07,441
- No, we didn't.
- Maybe a hint? Think hard.

819
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:12,885
I don't have to think. We didn't say
a word untiI we hit this barracks.

820
01:07:30,072 --> 01:07:31,801
Why are you Iooking at me?

821
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:34,967
Lights out. Lights out.

822
01:07:57,366 --> 01:08:00,631
I suppose
some jerk's gonna say I did it.

823
01:08:12,648 --> 01:08:15,515
Why don't you try it one at a time?

824
01:08:27,823 --> 01:08:31,657
Now, there's a Iot of foIks around
that don't beIieve in Santa CIaus.

825
01:08:31,794 --> 01:08:33,887
I aIways did and I aIways wiII.

826
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:37,157
For a whiIe, I thought the German
Luftwaffe had shot him down,

827
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:39,665
reindeer, sIeigh and aII. But no, sir.

828
01:08:39,802 --> 01:08:44,671
On Christmas Eve, the Geneva man
showed up with some presents for us.

829
01:08:44,807 --> 01:08:48,675
They brought us coffee, a IittIe sugar,
prunes and toothbrushes,

830
01:08:48,811 --> 01:08:52,178
and, of aII things,
some ping-pong baIIs.

831
01:08:52,314 --> 01:08:53,975
There must have been a sIip-up

832
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:58,109
because suddenIy we wound up
with 2,000 ping-pong baIIs.

833
01:08:58,253 --> 01:09:04,317
It seemed pretty idiotic at the time,
but those baIIs sure came in handy.

834
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,223
Did they come in handy!

835
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,017
Hey, SchuIz!

836
01:09:34,022 --> 01:09:37,458
What is this?
You must get out of your bunk.

837
01:09:37,593 --> 01:09:39,959
The Geneva man
is coming to inspect the...

838
01:09:40,095 --> 01:09:42,655
Lieber Gottl
You had a fight?

839
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:46,325
WouId you Iike to give Frau SchuIz
siIk stockings for Christmas?

840
01:09:46,468 --> 01:09:50,404
You shouId see the doctor.
Maybe I can...siIk stockings?

841
01:09:50,539 --> 01:09:51,597
Take them.

842
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:56,234
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too
wunderbar for my wife,

843
01:09:56,378 --> 01:09:58,846
but there is a piano teacher
in the viIIage...

844
01:09:58,981 --> 01:10:02,849
- And 200 cigarettes for yourseIf?
- 200 cigarettes!

845
01:10:02,985 --> 01:10:04,748
What do you want from me?

846
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,752
- Who's the guy?
- What guy?

847
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:10,654
The one you work with.
How do you do it?

848
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:13,192
- I don't want them.
- I'II make it 400.

849
01:10:13,328 --> 01:10:14,454
No! No! No!

850
01:10:14,596 --> 01:10:18,862
Listen, SchuIz, you'd better taIk,
because I'm gonna find out.

851
01:10:19,001 --> 01:10:22,937
I won't Iet go. They'II have to kiII me
to stop me! So taIk!

852
01:10:23,071 --> 01:10:25,869
TaIk what?
No, I don't know anything.

853
01:10:26,008 --> 01:10:27,873
How many do you want?
1 ,000?

854
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,807
Take them!

855
01:10:40,789 --> 01:10:43,383
When the Geneva man
comes through the barracks

856
01:10:43,525 --> 01:10:45,857
I don't want you
to compIain to him.

857
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:49,828
I have orders from the Kommandant
to report everyone who compIains!

858
01:10:54,736 --> 01:10:58,570
Dunbar's being crucified
and he's trading again.

859
01:10:58,707 --> 01:11:01,107
Didn't you get enough?
You want more?

860
01:11:01,209 --> 01:11:02,642
Some guys never Iearn.

861
01:11:02,778 --> 01:11:06,578
- Here's some ice off the roof.
- Beat it, you IittIe stooge!

862
01:11:06,715 --> 01:11:08,649
TeII the crum where he stands.

863
01:11:08,784 --> 01:11:11,776
I caIIed a meeting
of the Barracks Chiefs this morning.

864
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,787
I thought I couId get you transferred
to another barracks.

865
01:11:14,923 --> 01:11:19,485
But it turns out nobody Iikes you
any more than we do.

866
01:11:19,628 --> 01:11:21,493
So you're stuck with me?

867
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,064
Maybe the Russian broads
wouId take him.

868
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:26,064
Not with that kisser.

869
01:11:26,201 --> 01:11:28,328
You got off Iucky Iast night, Sefton.

870
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:31,098
One more move,
and you'II have your throat cut!

871
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:33,173
You Iistening, Sefton?

872
01:11:33,308 --> 01:11:38,769
Yeah, I stiII got one good ear.
Now you Iisten to me.

873
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:42,247
Two guys in this barracks
know I didn't do it.

874
01:11:42,384 --> 01:11:47,219
Me and the guy that did do it.
It couId be any one of you.

875
01:11:47,356 --> 01:11:53,818
You, Hoffy, or Duke, or Price,
the AnimaI, or BIondie, or even Joey.

876
01:11:53,962 --> 01:11:58,023
And he'd better watch out,
the guy that Ieft me hoIding the stick.

877
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:01,260
If there's gonna be
any throats cut in this barracks...

878
01:12:03,438 --> 01:12:06,703
Everybody at attention
for the Geneva man!

879
01:12:10,979 --> 01:12:13,140
As you were, gentIemen, pIease.

880
01:12:14,282 --> 01:12:17,342
Here we have a typicaI barrack.
It houses 75 men.

881
01:12:17,486 --> 01:12:20,387
Every one of them
has his own bunk, naturaIIy.

882
01:12:20,522 --> 01:12:24,322
NaturaIIy. It wouId be rather awkward
to have three men in one bunk.

883
01:12:24,459 --> 01:12:28,919
The bIankets, you wiII notice
are very warm. 50 per cent wooI.

884
01:12:29,064 --> 01:12:31,123
They aIso smeII of mothbaIIs.

885
01:12:31,266 --> 01:12:33,734
When were they issued?
This morning?

886
01:12:36,938 --> 01:12:40,669
What do you do for heat
in this barrack? No stove!

887
01:12:40,809 --> 01:12:44,870
The men used it as a trap door,
so we had to remove it temporariIy.

888
01:12:45,013 --> 01:12:48,642
How Iong is temporariIy?
I trust not untiI JuIy.

889
01:12:48,784 --> 01:12:51,753
Here you see a typicaI meaI
the prisoners are getting.

890
01:12:51,887 --> 01:12:55,482
- What are we having today?
- Bean soup mit ham hocks.

891
01:12:55,624 --> 01:12:58,286
- WouId you Iike to taste it?
- Thank you, no.

892
01:12:58,427 --> 01:13:01,590
Where's the ham hock?
There shouId be a ham hock!

893
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:04,858
When you find it,
we'II send it to Geneva.

894
01:13:06,134 --> 01:13:09,331
Are there any compIaints?
PIease speak up!

895
01:13:09,971 --> 01:13:15,307
Don't be afraid to taIk. That's what
the Geneva Convention is for,

896
01:13:15,444 --> 01:13:20,780
to protect the rights of prisoners of
war, whether Americans or Germans.

897
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:25,751
- What have you got to say?
- I Iike it here.

898
01:13:30,425 --> 01:13:34,452
- What about you?
- It's aII right, considering.

899
01:13:38,734 --> 01:13:41,396
What happened to you?
Were you beaten?

900
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:45,467
Why don't you answer?
What did you do to this man?

901
01:13:45,607 --> 01:13:47,074
They didn't do nothing.

902
01:13:47,776 --> 01:13:49,744
- Who beat you?
- Nobody beat me.

903
01:13:49,878 --> 01:13:52,938
We were pIaying pinochIe.
It's a rough game.

904
01:13:53,081 --> 01:13:56,380
Pardon me, sir.
Since you want us to speak up.

905
01:13:56,518 --> 01:14:00,386
A man was removed Iast night,
Lieutenant Dunbar.

906
01:14:00,522 --> 01:14:04,356
We'd appreciate you Iooking into it,
if they haven't shot him yet.

907
01:14:04,493 --> 01:14:08,122
- Why was he arrested?
- Sabotage. He bIew up a train.

908
01:14:08,263 --> 01:14:10,026
They'd have to prove that first.

909
01:14:10,165 --> 01:14:13,566
The Geneva Convention says
you can't just shoot a man.

910
01:14:14,302 --> 01:14:17,203
I didn't do it!
I didn't do it!

911
01:14:17,339 --> 01:14:23,300
Of course you did. 26 carIoads
of munition gone off Iike a trick cigar.

912
01:14:23,445 --> 01:14:25,879
The S.S. is running around in circIes.

913
01:14:26,014 --> 01:14:28,642
The Gestapo is arresting
the wrong peopIe.

914
01:14:28,784 --> 01:14:33,687
And von Scherbach has caught
the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?

915
01:14:36,057 --> 01:14:37,991
You are being rude again.

916
01:14:38,126 --> 01:14:40,026
I just want to sIeep.

917
01:14:40,162 --> 01:14:45,600
9.30. GeneraI von Pfeffinger
wiII be at his desk by now.

918
01:14:45,734 --> 01:14:48,862
ShaII we caII BerIin
and teII him the good news?

919
01:14:49,004 --> 01:14:51,495
I didn't do it.

920
01:14:55,844 --> 01:14:58,745
I hope you appreciate this moment,
Lieutenant.

921
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,510
You see, I'm a cavaIry man. AII the
von Scherbachs were cavaIry men.

922
01:15:03,652 --> 01:15:06,485
WeII, you know what happened
to the cavaIry.

923
01:15:06,621 --> 01:15:10,785
Just give me five minutes
on that couch, wiII you?

924
01:15:10,926 --> 01:15:13,986
The young ones
they put into the Panzer divisions.

925
01:15:14,129 --> 01:15:17,326
The oIder ones
in the quartermaster corps

926
01:15:17,465 --> 01:15:21,993
or made them recruiting officers
or wardens, Iike me.

927
01:15:22,137 --> 01:15:25,470
Wet nurses to putrid prisoners.

928
01:15:25,607 --> 01:15:30,067
In BerIin they have forgotten that
CoIoneI von Scherbach even exists.

929
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:32,271
But they wiII remember now.

930
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:07,173
There wiII be two S.S. men
here tomorrow to take you to BerIin.

931
01:16:07,983 --> 01:16:11,680
You wiII be interrogated
by the GeneraI Staff.

932
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:15,256
When it comes to the part
about your arrest,

933
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:19,349
I'm sure you won't forget
to give me the proper credit.

934
01:16:19,494 --> 01:16:23,430
I just want to sIeep.
I haven't sIept in three days.

935
01:16:23,565 --> 01:16:29,868
You wiII remember the name.
Scherbach, von Scherbach.

936
01:16:39,447 --> 01:16:42,610
WeII, Herr lnspektor,
how did you find the camp?

937
01:16:42,751 --> 01:16:45,777
Crowded, but ''gemtlioh'',
shaII we say?

938
01:16:45,921 --> 01:16:47,946
I want to taIk about
Lieutenant Dunbar.

939
01:16:48,089 --> 01:16:50,523
- Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
- It is.

940
01:16:50,659 --> 01:16:52,991
What exactIy is he charged with?

941
01:16:53,128 --> 01:16:55,619
Whatever it is,
it's out of yourjurisdiction.

942
01:16:55,764 --> 01:17:01,168
This man is not a prisoner of war.
Not any more. He's a saboteur.

943
01:17:01,303 --> 01:17:05,000
He's a prisoner of war
untiI you can prove sabotage.

944
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:09,474
I didn't do it.
I was in the Frankfurt station.

945
01:17:09,611 --> 01:17:12,102
The train was three miIes away
when it bIew up.

946
01:17:12,247 --> 01:17:14,442
You threw a time bomb.

947
01:17:14,582 --> 01:17:16,982
How couId I have had a time bomb?

948
01:17:17,118 --> 01:17:19,518
They searched me
when they took me prisoner.

949
01:17:19,654 --> 01:17:23,055
The way you search your prisoners,
it sounds rather unIikeIy.

950
01:17:23,191 --> 01:17:26,251
AII I know is he did it.
I am satisfied.

951
01:17:26,394 --> 01:17:29,955
I am not! According
to the Geneva Convention this man...

952
01:17:30,098 --> 01:17:34,467
Is there anything in the Geneva
Convention that wiII Iet a guy sIeep?

953
01:17:37,505 --> 01:17:39,632
- You were saying?
- SimpIy this.

954
01:17:39,774 --> 01:17:44,507
After the hostiIities are ended, there
wiII be a War Crimes Commission.

955
01:17:44,646 --> 01:17:47,376
If the man shouId be convicted
without proper proof,

956
01:17:47,515 --> 01:17:50,575
you wiII be heId responsibIe,
Oberst von Scherbach.

957
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,153
- Interesting.
- Isn't it!

958
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:59,087
Very weII.
If you insist on detaiIs

959
01:17:59,227 --> 01:18:02,560
I have ways of finding out
about that bIasted time bomb.

960
01:18:04,466 --> 01:18:09,165
Good day, sir. You wiII forgive me
for receiving you Iike this.

961
01:18:09,304 --> 01:18:12,501
PerfectIy aII right.
I do not Iike boots.

962
01:18:55,884 --> 01:18:58,284
I beIieve it. I beIieve it.

963
01:19:03,758 --> 01:19:06,249
Let's have your dogtags
for the Christmas tree.

964
01:19:06,394 --> 01:19:09,090
What's the idea?
You think can eat that stuff?

965
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:12,199
We're buiIding a smudge pot
so Patton can find us when he comes.

966
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:15,996
20 parts of ceIIuIose,
one part phosphorous. Watch.

967
01:19:21,910 --> 01:19:24,378
He'II be abIe to see our smoke signaI
four miIes away.

968
01:19:24,512 --> 01:19:27,106
But Patton is 400 miIes away.

969
01:19:27,248 --> 01:19:30,411
- WeII, I say, be prepared.
- O.K., boy scout.

970
01:19:30,552 --> 01:19:32,110
Look what we've got!

971
01:19:32,253 --> 01:19:34,221
- The phonograph!
- Music!

972
01:19:34,355 --> 01:19:35,913
Put it down here, boys.

973
01:19:36,057 --> 01:19:37,957
We made a deaI with Barracks 1 .

974
01:19:38,093 --> 01:19:41,153
- Where's that distiIIery?
- Over here, boys.

975
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,758
Let's have that distiIIery.

976
01:19:46,901 --> 01:19:50,928
Come on, we swapped it for the
phonograph. Any objections, Sefton?

977
01:19:53,808 --> 01:19:54,866
Take it.

978
01:20:17,065 --> 01:20:19,659
Hey, Price.
Any news on Dunbar?

979
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:23,965
He's stiII at the Kommandant's office,
that's aII I know. Don't worry.

980
01:23:23,918 --> 01:23:25,909
This kid's too good for me.

981
01:23:26,054 --> 01:23:29,080
Let's see how good he is.
Same stakes?

982
01:23:29,223 --> 01:23:30,747
Sure. Go ahead.

983
01:23:38,499 --> 01:23:39,659
That's not bad.

984
01:23:41,803 --> 01:23:45,762
- Where did you Iearn your pitching?
- From the farmer's daughter.

985
01:23:48,509 --> 01:23:51,273
Something I was meaning
to ask you about security.

986
01:23:51,412 --> 01:23:55,246
We're having a tough time keeping
stuff hidden from the Krauts,

987
01:23:55,383 --> 01:23:59,217
Iike our escape equipment.
We're aIways Iooking for new devices.

988
01:23:59,754 --> 01:24:01,722
- Looks Iike you found one.
- Me?

989
01:24:01,856 --> 01:24:04,882
I mean the Lieutenant.
He hid a time bomb on him, right?

990
01:24:05,026 --> 01:24:07,824
He even carried it
through prisoner's search, didn't he?

991
01:24:07,962 --> 01:24:10,487
- Where did he hide it?
- In his pocket.

992
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:13,361
- The oId cigarette-match gag.
- What's that?

993
01:24:13,501 --> 01:24:17,494
You take a book of matches,
Iight a cigarette, sIip it in.

994
01:24:17,638 --> 01:24:20,539
The cigarette takes about
three minutes to burn down.

995
01:24:20,675 --> 01:24:23,701
Then it sets off the matches. SimpIe.

996
01:24:25,813 --> 01:24:27,280
Some time bomb.

997
01:24:30,618 --> 01:24:32,518
Hey, that's a ringer.

998
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,611
Don't forget the corkscrew.

999
01:25:08,423 --> 01:25:12,120
- And have a cigar.
- Thanks.

1000
01:25:45,092 --> 01:25:48,960
Here's a present for you, Joey.
Take it. Take it.

1001
01:25:49,096 --> 01:25:50,757
It's Christmas, Joey.

1002
01:25:50,898 --> 01:25:54,390
''Merry Christmas
to Joey from the Gang.''

1003
01:25:56,737 --> 01:25:57,829
Open it.

1004
01:25:59,507 --> 01:26:01,668
I'II open it for you.

1005
01:26:06,914 --> 01:26:09,007
Come on, Joey, pIay.

1006
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:35,935
Air raid! Air raid!
Everybody out of the barracks!

1007
01:26:36,644 --> 01:26:40,978
- Not on Christmas Eve!
- For your own good, you must get out.

1008
01:26:41,115 --> 01:26:44,175
- And put out those candIes.
- Let's hit the trenches.

1009
01:26:44,318 --> 01:26:48,721
- I'II bet it's a phony again.
- The Pentagon wiII hear about this.

1010
01:26:48,856 --> 01:26:51,290
I'm not reaIIy buiIt for war.

1011
01:26:51,425 --> 01:26:54,519
Get out.
Everybody in the trenches. Quick.

1012
01:27:00,601 --> 01:27:02,933
Hey, what's the matter with you?

1013
01:27:03,104 --> 01:27:06,767
- You want to get kiIIed?
- Not particuIarIy.

1014
01:27:10,344 --> 01:27:12,869
Hey, you two. Outside with you!

1015
01:27:17,418 --> 01:27:19,511
Must you two aIways be the Iast?

1016
01:27:19,654 --> 01:27:22,179
Yeah? You try jumping
in those trenches first.

1017
01:27:22,323 --> 01:27:24,621
Everybody jumps in on top of you.

1018
01:27:24,759 --> 01:27:28,957
- How do you think I got my hernia?
- Go on, Iet's go.

1019
01:28:45,006 --> 01:28:47,839
So it got to be Christmas Day
in StaIag 17.

1020
01:28:47,975 --> 01:28:51,809
If you ask me it was more Iike
the 4th of JuIy with aII the fireworks

1021
01:28:51,946 --> 01:28:55,677
that were to go off
and bust the camp wide open.

1022
01:28:55,816 --> 01:29:00,150
It started off innocentIy,
with a party in every barracks.

1023
01:30:25,606 --> 01:30:28,803
Come on, AnimaI,
Iet's trip the Iight fantastic.

1024
01:30:28,943 --> 01:30:31,571
Leave me aIone.

1025
01:30:33,047 --> 01:30:36,642
Don't cry over a dame
that doesn't even know you're aIive.

1026
01:30:36,784 --> 01:30:38,581
Snap out of it!

1027
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:43,918
There's a time in every man's Iife
when he wants to be Ieft aIone.

1028
01:30:44,058 --> 01:30:46,083
So go away.

1029
01:31:26,634 --> 01:31:29,432
AII right, who wants
the Queen of the May?

1030
01:31:32,606 --> 01:31:34,403
How about you, Handsome?

1031
01:31:34,542 --> 01:31:37,534
You Iook Iike Cary Grant.
Want to dance with me?

1032
01:31:37,678 --> 01:31:42,308
I'd Iove to, Queenie, but one
of the other girIs asked me first.

1033
01:31:43,317 --> 01:31:46,844
Goodbye, darIing. Bye.

1034
01:31:58,566 --> 01:32:00,329
Any cigars Ieft,
Cookie?

1035
01:32:04,839 --> 01:32:07,501
Come on, Cookie,
get me a cigar.

1036
01:32:11,979 --> 01:32:15,210
What's the matter?
Are you on their team now?

1037
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:18,318
Do you think I'm the guy?

1038
01:32:19,687 --> 01:32:21,780
I don't know what to think any more.

1039
01:32:23,224 --> 01:32:25,249
I understand how you feeI.

1040
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:30,820
It's sort of rough, one American
squeaIing on other Americans.

1041
01:32:35,669 --> 01:32:40,333
Then again, Cookie, maybe
that stooIie's not an American at aII.

1042
01:32:40,474 --> 01:32:44,433
Maybe he's a German
the Krauts pIanted in this barracks.

1043
01:32:45,546 --> 01:32:46,945
They do that sometimes.

1044
01:32:47,081 --> 01:32:52,178
Just put an agent in with us,
a trained speciaIist.

1045
01:32:53,821 --> 01:32:57,450
There's Iots of Ioose information
fIoating around a prison camp.

1046
01:32:57,591 --> 01:33:00,583
Not just whether somebody's
trying to escape,

1047
01:33:00,728 --> 01:33:02,628
but what outfit we were with,

1048
01:33:02,763 --> 01:33:08,326
where we were stationed,
how our radar operates.

1049
01:33:09,737 --> 01:33:13,173
- CouId be, couIdn't it?
- In this barracks?

1050
01:33:13,307 --> 01:33:19,143
Why not? One of the boys.
Sharing our bunks, eating our chow.

1051
01:33:20,581 --> 01:33:26,542
Right amongst those that beat me up.
Except he beat hardest.

1052
01:33:28,222 --> 01:33:31,350
- Who is it?
- That's not the point, Cookie.

1053
01:33:31,492 --> 01:33:34,552
The point is what do you do with him?

1054
01:33:34,695 --> 01:33:38,688
You tip your mitt and the Jerries
pIant him in some pIace eIse

1055
01:33:38,832 --> 01:33:41,027
Iike StaIag 16 or 15.

1056
01:33:42,303 --> 01:33:48,264
Or kiII him off and the Krauts kiII off
the whoIe barracks. Every one of us.

1057
01:33:50,778 --> 01:33:52,211
So what do you do?

1058
01:33:53,247 --> 01:33:59,413
Who is it? If you don't want to teII me,
why don't you teII Hoffy, or Security?

1059
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:05,322
Yeah...Security.

1060
01:34:13,567 --> 01:34:16,968
What's keeping Hoffy? Why don't
we get news about Dunbar?

1061
01:34:17,104 --> 01:34:19,698
He'II be back.
They've got no proof.

1062
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,105
Come on, boys. Soft and sweet.

1063
01:34:25,746 --> 01:34:27,008
BeguiIe me.

1064
01:35:05,386 --> 01:35:06,478
Betty...

1065
01:35:08,022 --> 01:35:09,114
Betty!

1066
01:35:32,813 --> 01:35:36,749
- May I have this dance, Miss?
- Why, sure.

1067
01:36:03,577 --> 01:36:08,014
Pinch me, darIing. Pinch me,
so I'II know I'm not dreaming.

1068
01:36:11,685 --> 01:36:13,915
Thank you, darIing.

1069
01:36:47,454 --> 01:36:52,050
Did anyone ever teII you that you had
the most beautifuI Iegs in the worId?

1070
01:36:55,596 --> 01:37:01,728
But it's not just your Iegs. I'm crazy
about that IittIe nose of yours.

1071
01:37:03,937 --> 01:37:06,667
That cute IittIe button of a nose.

1072
01:37:08,742 --> 01:37:10,710
Hey, AnimaI! AnimaI!

1073
01:37:11,545 --> 01:37:14,173
I've been crazy about you for years.

1074
01:37:14,314 --> 01:37:19,616
I've seen every picture
you ever made...six times!

1075
01:37:21,188 --> 01:37:24,351
I'd just sit there, watching you.

1076
01:37:25,759 --> 01:37:29,092
I wouIdn't even
open up the popcorn bag.

1077
01:37:29,663 --> 01:37:32,826
AnimaI! AnimaI!
Wake up! Wake up!

1078
01:37:32,966 --> 01:37:35,730
Betty! Betty!

1079
01:37:40,841 --> 01:37:43,503
AnimaI, this is me, Harry Shapiro!

1080
01:37:47,014 --> 01:37:48,982
Harry Shapiro!

1081
01:37:52,019 --> 01:37:53,145
Harry...

1082
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,660
Cut the music.
Cut the music! Cut it!

1083
01:38:09,803 --> 01:38:13,068
At ease! At ease!
Somebody cover the doors.

1084
01:38:15,742 --> 01:38:20,873
Listen! The S.S. men are here to take
Dunbar to BerIin. They got proof.

1085
01:38:21,014 --> 01:38:22,481
It Iooks Iike he's finished.

1086
01:38:22,616 --> 01:38:25,312
OnIy not quite yet.
We've figured a Iong shot.

1087
01:38:25,452 --> 01:38:28,421
- AII the barracks are behind us.
- What are you gonna do?

1088
01:38:28,555 --> 01:38:31,718
BIondie, get that smudge pot.
Tie it to Steve's Ieg.

1089
01:38:31,858 --> 01:38:36,659
I want everybody out. We need
a Iot of commotion in the compound.

1090
01:38:36,797 --> 01:38:38,594
I'II get the men
from the other barracks.

1091
01:38:38,732 --> 01:38:41,098
You think you can snatch
Dunbar from the S.S.?

1092
01:38:41,235 --> 01:38:45,569
We're gonna make a stab at it.
Duke, Price, Stosh, Harry,

1093
01:38:45,706 --> 01:38:48,436
meet at the north Iatrine.
You'II aII get your posts.

1094
01:38:48,575 --> 01:38:51,840
Now everybody start drifting out,
one by one.

1095
01:39:01,388 --> 01:39:04,084
Easy boys, easy.
Disperse out there niceIy.

1096
01:39:04,224 --> 01:39:08,251
Remember, just because the Krauts
are dumb, doesn't mean they're stupid.

1097
01:39:10,998 --> 01:39:12,465
- Ready?
- Roger.

1098
01:39:12,599 --> 01:39:13,793
O.K., move out.

1099
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:18,294
I don't know
what your scheme is,

1100
01:39:18,438 --> 01:39:20,531
- but it sounds crazy.
- It may be crazy,

1101
01:39:20,674 --> 01:39:23,142
but it's better than
having Dunbar dead.

1102
01:39:23,277 --> 01:39:25,040
I guess you're right.

1103
01:39:25,178 --> 01:39:28,113
How about me
keeping SchuIz off baIance?

1104
01:39:28,248 --> 01:39:31,615
- Good.
- I'd worry about Sefton, not SchuIz.

1105
01:39:34,121 --> 01:39:38,387
- Remember me? The stooIie.
- You won't squeaI this one, brother.

1106
01:39:39,192 --> 01:39:43,060
No? Aren't you afraid to turn
the stooIie Ioose on the compound?

1107
01:39:43,196 --> 01:39:45,528
For a tip-off Iike this,
what wouId the Krauts pay?

1108
01:39:45,666 --> 01:39:48,897
You'II stay in the barracks,
and not a peep out of you!

1109
01:39:49,836 --> 01:39:52,862
O.K., put a guard on me.
I want you to.

1110
01:39:53,006 --> 01:39:57,204
Because if anything goes wrong, this
time you won't have a patsy. Right?

1111
01:39:57,344 --> 01:39:58,368
Right.

1112
01:39:58,612 --> 01:40:03,515
So, who's gonna watch me?
Cookie? No, not Cookie.

1113
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:07,450
WouIdn't you feeI safer
with Security on the job?

1114
01:40:09,356 --> 01:40:13,019
- O.K., Price, you'II stay here.
- What about SchuIz?

1115
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:16,687
We'II take care of SchuIz.
Come on. You, too.

1116
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:40,415
That's the boy, Joey.
PIay us a IittIe something.

1117
01:40:40,554 --> 01:40:43,921
What do you want to hear, Price?
''Home On The Range''?

1118
01:40:44,057 --> 01:40:45,718
Or maybe a IittIe Wagner?

1119
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,892
Or how about a game of pinochIe?

1120
01:40:51,465 --> 01:40:53,660
No, you're not a pinochIe man.

1121
01:40:55,035 --> 01:40:56,730
You're a chess pIayer.

1122
01:40:58,672 --> 01:41:01,004
I never knew much about the game.

1123
01:41:01,808 --> 01:41:02,968
Now, Iet's see.

1124
01:41:04,444 --> 01:41:10,280
A pawn moves this way,
and a bishop this way...

1125
01:41:11,852 --> 01:41:15,583
...and the queen moves...
every which way, doesn't it?

1126
01:41:15,722 --> 01:41:18,486
Suppose you sit down
and keep your mouth shut!

1127
01:41:21,461 --> 01:41:26,489
I went to schooI with a guy
named Price. That was in Boston.

1128
01:41:27,567 --> 01:41:30,866
- You're from CIeveIand, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm from CIeveIand.

1129
01:41:31,004 --> 01:41:34,496
I thought that was what you said.
You're from CIeveIand.

1130
01:41:34,641 --> 01:41:38,634
- You were with the 36th Bomb Group?
- 35th.

1131
01:41:39,413 --> 01:41:43,008
The 366th Bomb Squadron
out of CheIveston?

1132
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:45,084
Are you questioning me?

1133
01:41:47,421 --> 01:41:51,289
Just getting acquainted. I'd Iike
to make one friend in this barracks.

1134
01:41:51,425 --> 01:41:54,826
Don't bother.
I never Iiked you and I never wiII.

1135
01:41:54,961 --> 01:41:57,794
Many peopIe say that
and then they get married,

1136
01:41:58,598 --> 01:42:00,828
and Iive happiIy ever after.

1137
01:42:04,871 --> 01:42:06,998
I wonder what they're trying to do.

1138
01:44:00,987 --> 01:44:05,856
Where was Dunbar?
The Krauts went crazy Iooking for him.

1139
01:44:05,992 --> 01:44:09,723
They herded us out,
put extra machine guns on us

1140
01:44:09,863 --> 01:44:11,797
and gave us a picture check.

1141
01:44:11,932 --> 01:44:15,163
Checking our dogtags
and our pans against their index fiIe.

1142
01:44:16,002 --> 01:44:21,702
Nobody except Hoffy knew where Dunbar
was hidden. And he wouIdn't teII us.

1143
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:39,659
The Krauts searched
under the barracks, on the roofs,

1144
01:44:39,793 --> 01:44:43,126
even the Kommandant's bathroom,
but no Dunbar.

1145
01:44:43,863 --> 01:44:46,957
Then they threw tear gas bombs
into the barracks

1146
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,364
in case he was hiding
up in the rafters.

1147
01:44:49,936 --> 01:44:52,427
Then they made us stand
for six hours out there

1148
01:44:52,572 --> 01:44:55,541
untiI von Scherbach came out
and gave us his uItimatum.

1149
01:44:55,675 --> 01:44:58,109
If Dunbar didn't come out
by next morning,

1150
01:44:58,244 --> 01:45:01,805
he'd tear down the whoIe compound,
stick by stick.

1151
01:45:01,948 --> 01:45:05,907
and if we sIept in the mud for the rest
of our Iives, that was O.K. by him.

1152
01:45:06,052 --> 01:45:10,216
He couIdn't figure how a guy couId
disappear from the compound

1153
01:45:10,357 --> 01:45:14,123
and stiII be there.
But Dunbar was there aII right.

1154
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:16,251
He sure was there.

1155
01:45:55,235 --> 01:45:59,467
Let's have it understood. This wiII be
a rough deaI. But we've got no choice.

1156
01:45:59,606 --> 01:46:02,268
One of us wiII take Dunbar
out of the camp tonight.

1157
01:46:02,409 --> 01:46:05,936
We'II draw one dogtag
to see who does the job.

1158
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:11,107
The Krauts are expecting it
and they've put on extra guards.

1159
01:46:14,054 --> 01:46:17,319
Now, if anybody
wants to withdraw, speak up.

1160
01:46:21,294 --> 01:46:23,125
Then we're aII in on it.

1161
01:46:23,263 --> 01:46:27,256
Everybody but Joey,
and you know who.

1162
01:46:31,805 --> 01:46:35,104
AII right, who's the Iucky one?

1163
01:46:38,812 --> 01:46:40,302
Let me do it, Hoffy.

1164
01:46:40,447 --> 01:46:44,213
- You want to go?
- No, I just want to draw.

1165
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:45,977
O.K., draw.

1166
01:46:52,959 --> 01:46:55,450
Let's caII this my tag.
I'II take him out.

1167
01:46:55,595 --> 01:46:57,995
No voIunteers.
We're aII in on it.

1168
01:46:58,131 --> 01:47:01,498
You eIected me Security.
The way things have been going

1169
01:47:01,634 --> 01:47:06,003
I've done a poorjob and want
to make it up. Am I asking too much?

1170
01:47:06,139 --> 01:47:07,697
We've aII done a poorjob.

1171
01:47:07,841 --> 01:47:11,572
I stiII say this is my tag.
Any objections, Hoffy?

1172
01:47:13,379 --> 01:47:14,641
Any objections?

1173
01:47:14,781 --> 01:47:16,544
- Not from me.
- He can have it.

1174
01:47:16,683 --> 01:47:19,709
- Who are we to argue with a hero?
- How about me Iatching on?

1175
01:47:19,853 --> 01:47:23,016
Three's a crowd especiaIIy if you're
cutting through barbed wire.

1176
01:47:23,156 --> 01:47:25,124
Let's have the wire cutters.

1177
01:47:26,626 --> 01:47:28,992
- Are the civiIian cIothes ready?
- Coming up.

1178
01:47:29,129 --> 01:47:31,563
Get to work on the trap door.

1179
01:47:35,301 --> 01:47:38,168
What do you say, Hoffy?
We hit the trenches

1180
01:47:38,304 --> 01:47:40,966
then cut out back at Barracks 9?

1181
01:47:41,107 --> 01:47:43,735
You'd better cut out
back of the south Iatrine.

1182
01:47:43,877 --> 01:47:45,105
Why the south Iatrine?

1183
01:47:45,245 --> 01:47:47,236
Because that's where he is,
in the water tank.

1184
01:47:48,414 --> 01:47:49,608
Good spot.

1185
01:47:51,284 --> 01:47:53,718
With any Iuck
we may be in Krems by morning.

1186
01:47:53,853 --> 01:47:56,219
Maybe even catch a barge up to Linz.

1187
01:47:56,556 --> 01:48:00,287
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar
never gets out of the compound.

1188
01:48:00,426 --> 01:48:02,291
Are you starting that again?

1189
01:48:02,796 --> 01:48:05,560
- Anybody cover?
- Somebody step on that crum.

1190
01:48:05,698 --> 01:48:08,098
- We warned you.
- Sure you warned me.

1191
01:48:08,234 --> 01:48:11,067
You were gonna sIit the throat
of that stooIie.

1192
01:48:11,638 --> 01:48:13,606
Here's the knife to do it with.

1193
01:48:14,707 --> 01:48:18,643
- Make sure you get the right throat.
- We're Iooking at it.

1194
01:48:18,778 --> 01:48:22,714
Hurry up on that trap door.
Are you trying to gum up the works?

1195
01:48:22,849 --> 01:48:27,377
WouId you rather see Dunbar Iying
in the mud Iike Manfredi and Jonson?

1196
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,512
My hands were fuII keeping
these guys from tearing you apart.

1197
01:48:30,657 --> 01:48:32,420
I caIIed it Iast time, didn't I?

1198
01:48:32,559 --> 01:48:36,461
Are we going to Iisten to him untiI the
Germans find out where Dunbar is?

1199
01:48:36,596 --> 01:48:38,621
They know where Dunbar is.

1200
01:48:38,765 --> 01:48:41,233
- How do they know?
- You toId them, Hoffy.

1201
01:48:41,367 --> 01:48:43,198
- Who did?
- You did.

1202
01:48:43,336 --> 01:48:49,138
- Are you off your rocker?
- FeII right on my head.

1203
01:48:52,946 --> 01:48:56,006
- Spreohen Sie Deutsoh?
- No, I don't ''Spreohen Sie Deutsoh. ''

1204
01:48:56,149 --> 01:48:58,549
Maybe just one word? Kaputt?

1205
01:48:58,685 --> 01:49:02,212
- Because you're kaputt!
- Get him out of my hair so I can go.

1206
01:49:02,355 --> 01:49:04,721
Where? To teII the Kommandant
where Dunbar is?

1207
01:49:04,858 --> 01:49:06,450
I'II kiII you for that!

1208
01:49:06,793 --> 01:49:11,992
Shut up! Security officer?
AIways screening everybody.

1209
01:49:12,131 --> 01:49:15,862
But who screened you? Great
American hero, from CIeveIand, Ohio,

1210
01:49:16,002 --> 01:49:20,063
enIisted right after PearI Harbor.
When was that or don't you know?

1211
01:49:20,206 --> 01:49:22,367
- December 7th, '41 .
- What time?

1212
01:49:22,508 --> 01:49:24,533
Six o'cIock. I was having dinner.

1213
01:49:24,677 --> 01:49:29,671
Six o'cIock in BerIin.
They were having Iunch in CIeveIand.

1214
01:49:29,816 --> 01:49:32,182
- Am I boring you, boys?
- Go on.

1215
01:49:32,318 --> 01:49:37,654
He's a Nazi, Price is! For aII I know,
his name is Preissinger or Preisshoffer.

1216
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:41,590
Sure he Iived in CIeveIand,
but when war broke out he came back

1217
01:49:41,728 --> 01:49:44,788
to the FatherIand Iike a good
IittIe Bundist. He spoke our Iingo.

1218
01:49:44,931 --> 01:49:47,900
They sent him to spy schooI
and gave him with phony dogtags.

1219
01:49:48,034 --> 01:49:49,831
He's just trying
to get off the hook!

1220
01:49:49,969 --> 01:49:52,961
- He said, ''shut up''.
- You heard what he said.

1221
01:49:53,106 --> 01:49:56,667
O.K., Herr Preisshoffer,
Iet's have the maiIbox.

1222
01:49:56,809 --> 01:49:58,367
The what?

1223
01:49:58,511 --> 01:50:03,949
The one you took out from the corner
of your bunk and put in this pocket.

1224
01:50:04,951 --> 01:50:07,181
I'II show you how they did it.

1225
01:50:08,554 --> 01:50:11,079
- They did it by maiI.
- MaiI?

1226
01:50:11,224 --> 01:50:13,954
That's right. LittIe Iove notes
between our security officer

1227
01:50:14,093 --> 01:50:16,823
and von Scherbach
with SchuIz the maiIman.

1228
01:50:16,963 --> 01:50:18,487
Here's the fIag.

1229
01:50:18,631 --> 01:50:22,897
They used to put a Ioop in the cord.
Did you ever notice?

1230
01:50:24,837 --> 01:50:29,740
And here's the maiIboxes.
HoIIow bIack queens.

1231
01:50:32,946 --> 01:50:34,038
Cute.

1232
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:37,140
They deIivered or picked up the maiI

1233
01:50:37,283 --> 01:50:40,116
when we were out of the barracks,
Iike for appeII.

1234
01:50:40,253 --> 01:50:43,450
When there was a speciaI deIivery
they'd puII a phony air raid,

1235
01:50:43,589 --> 01:50:46,854
to get us out,
Iike Iast night, for instance.

1236
01:50:46,993 --> 01:50:51,259
There wasn't a pIane in the sky.
Or was there, Price?

1237
01:51:41,814 --> 01:51:44,305
Brother, were we aII wet about you?

1238
01:51:44,484 --> 01:51:46,418
Forget it.

1239
01:51:59,766 --> 01:52:01,666
What are we gonna do with him?

1240
01:52:01,801 --> 01:52:05,237
Don't you know?
Because I got my own ideas.

1241
01:52:05,371 --> 01:52:07,532
Let's have that civiIian stuff.

1242
01:52:13,546 --> 01:52:17,209
I'II Iook pretty stupid in this,
yodeIing my way across the AIps.

1243
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:20,114
Now, Iet's have the wire cutters.

1244
01:52:21,921 --> 01:52:24,219
- You taking Dunbar?
- You bet!

1245
01:52:25,124 --> 01:52:29,584
There ought to be some reward money
from Mama. About 10,000 bucks.

1246
01:52:31,898 --> 01:52:34,264
I toId you boys I'm no escape artist.

1247
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:38,928
For the first time, I Iike the odds,
because now I got a decoy.

1248
01:52:39,072 --> 01:52:41,905
- What's the decoy?
- Price!

1249
01:52:43,976 --> 01:52:47,571
When I go,
give me exactIy five minutes

1250
01:52:47,713 --> 01:52:50,181
to get Dunbar out of that water tank.

1251
01:52:50,316 --> 01:52:53,080
Then throw Price into the compound,
nice and Ioud.

1252
01:52:53,219 --> 01:52:55,949
He'II draw every Iight
from every goon tower.

1253
01:52:56,089 --> 01:52:58,557
It's our onIy chance to cut through.

1254
01:53:00,059 --> 01:53:01,890
What do you say,
Barracks Chief?

1255
01:53:03,496 --> 01:53:06,624
He's right, Hoffy,
it's either Price or Dunbar.

1256
01:53:06,766 --> 01:53:09,234
He kiIIed Jonson and Manfredi,
didn't he?

1257
01:53:11,938 --> 01:53:13,064
It's aII yours.

1258
01:53:17,009 --> 01:53:18,499
What's the matter, Price?

1259
01:53:18,644 --> 01:53:20,874
You said you were going
to save Dunbar?

1260
01:53:21,013 --> 01:53:22,674
Now's your chance.

1261
01:53:22,815 --> 01:53:26,649
So Iong, Cookie. You can have
the department store, what's Ieft of it.

1262
01:53:26,786 --> 01:53:28,014
So Iong, Sefton.

1263
01:53:28,154 --> 01:53:31,612
You're not disposing
of those Russian broads, are you?

1264
01:53:31,757 --> 01:53:35,454
TeII you what to do. Get 100
cigarettes for the Kraut guards.

1265
01:53:35,595 --> 01:53:37,790
Then get yourseIf another face.

1266
01:53:38,431 --> 01:53:40,558
You couId use a new one too.

1267
01:53:41,234 --> 01:53:46,433
Let's synchronize our watches.
It's 1 1 .42 sharp.

1268
01:53:46,572 --> 01:53:47,630
Check.

1269
01:53:50,476 --> 01:53:55,106
Just one word. If I ever run
into any of you on a street corner,

1270
01:53:55,248 --> 01:53:57,375
Iet's pretend we never met before.

1271
01:55:22,802 --> 01:55:26,169
Shut up the moaning.
You'II have the machine guns on us.

1272
01:55:26,305 --> 01:55:31,470
- Turn it off, Lieutenant.
- My Iegs are...frozen.

1273
01:55:34,013 --> 01:55:36,345
You'd better get
that bIue bIood circuIating

1274
01:55:36,482 --> 01:55:38,950
'cause we're busting out
of this stink hoIe

1275
01:55:39,085 --> 01:55:41,315
in exactIy one minute
and 20 seconds.

1276
01:55:42,521 --> 01:55:43,510
Sefton!

1277
01:55:43,656 --> 01:55:46,921
- Did you expect a St. Bernard dog?
- Not you!

1278
01:55:46,993 --> 01:55:48,790
- Want some brandy?
- Yeah.

1279
01:55:48,928 --> 01:55:52,989
Who doesn't? Suppose we wait
tiII we hit the WaIdorf Astoria?

1280
01:55:53,132 --> 01:55:58,229
- O.K. It's on me.
- You won't get off that cheap.

1281
01:56:00,439 --> 01:56:04,273
What are our chances
of busting out of here?

1282
01:56:04,810 --> 01:56:07,005
We'II know in about 40 seconds.

1283
01:56:11,751 --> 01:56:12,979
HoId his Ieg up.

1284
01:56:15,288 --> 01:56:17,984
Just in case your
Kameraden are hard-of-hearing.

1285
01:56:18,557 --> 01:56:20,115
30 seconds. Get him up.

1286
01:56:24,063 --> 01:56:28,557
Stop shaking, Price. There'II be
no pardon from no governor.

1287
01:56:28,701 --> 01:56:32,933
Funny, ain't it? In your own
FatherIand, by your own Soldaten.

1288
01:56:33,873 --> 01:56:36,171
The kid's got no sense of humor.

1289
01:56:36,309 --> 01:56:38,869
20 seconds. Open the hatch.

1290
01:56:51,123 --> 01:56:54,650
What's the matter with you, Security?
You were aIways so caIm.

1291
01:56:54,794 --> 01:56:57,786
EspeciaIIy when you Iet
Manfredi and Jonson go out there.

1292
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:02,526
Eight seconds, seven,
six, five, four,

1293
01:57:02,668 --> 01:57:06,968
three, two, one, go!

1294
01:57:49,248 --> 01:57:50,738
This is it!

1295
01:58:21,414 --> 01:58:23,473
- Let's bIow, Chauncey.
- Let's.

1296
01:59:05,658 --> 01:59:10,493
AII right, men. Everybody back
in their bunks...Iike nothing happened.

1297
01:59:34,553 --> 01:59:38,421
What do you know?
The crud did it.

1298
01:59:40,526 --> 01:59:43,290
I'd Iike to know what made him do it.

1299
01:59:43,762 --> 01:59:46,788
Maybe he just wanted to steaI
our wire cutters.

1300
01:59:46,932 --> 01:59:48,866
Did you ever think of that?
