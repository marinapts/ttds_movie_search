THE DEVILS

00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:58,556
"A painting is always
quite moral

3
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:02,033
"when it is tragic and it gives
the horror

00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,558
of the things it depicts."

"Delassalle Boarding School"

6
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:34,989
- Monsieur Delassalle...
- Yes.

7
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:39,167
- It's about time you blew
your horn. - It's okay...

8
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:41,764
I'll get the things out of
the car.

9
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:19,575
- Your salads are rotten!
- You aren't paying for them.

10
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:40,559
Line up, please.
And be quiet.

11
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,294
Oh, what a pain.

12
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,851
- Lovely kids!
- Can't wait for the escape.

13
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:07,923
Get out!

14
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:17,058
Do your eyes hurt, dear colleague?

15
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:19,593
I hurt myself getting up.

16
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:22,937
You're up early. Last night,
I was doing my rounds...

17
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:26,775
about 4 A.M., and I heard screams
coming out of your room.

18
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:32,216
The chaste woman loves to
contemplate dawn, doesn't she?

19
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,811
You spent too much time with the
Jesuits, M. Drain.

20
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:38,414
Everyone can't be thrown out
of the school system.

21
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,719
Brute!

22
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,527
- "Tiene, Senora."
- Thank you, darling.

23
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:48,629
Oh, it's so nice!

24
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,601
We all need a vacation.

25
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:53,127
Our body needs to eliminate
its toxins.

26
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:55,402
Tomorrow, mademoiselle, I'll be
all naked, and you...

27
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,238
how did you plan this long
weekend?

28
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,246
I'll be home, in Niort.
Deux Sevres. Heard of it?

29
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,215
Sous-Prefecture Maine,
Bressuire and Partenay.

30
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:07,446
Getting some fresh air?

31
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:09,579
It warms up my heart, M. Drain.

32
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:11,953
It still has the smell
of the country.

33
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,891
A graceful instrument,
but with all the rains...

34
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,259
I prefer my old umbrella.

35
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:19,628
In my country, instead of your
ugly black umbrella...

36
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:21,792
you'd wear a sombrero
and...

37
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:25,531
spend your breaks in a hammock.

38
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:29,063
It's such a frivolous thing
to give an educator.

39
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:32,440
Does your teacher really look
that way, Jose?

40
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:35,241
Yes, sir. And he used to come
to school on a horse.

41
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,840
I'll never get used to it.

42
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:41,114
I told him it was
a horse to please him.

43
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:44,316
- It was only a mule.
- Go play, Joselito.

44
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,884
- What's the matter?
- Look.

45
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,795
- Miguel.
- Of course, Michel. Who else?

46
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,862
- Did you have another fight?
- He came back at 3 A.M.

47
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,132
How have you stood him for
so long?

48
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:00,968
He wasn't always that way.

49
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:03,770
At the beginning, he really
made me happy.

50
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:05,140
It was for your money.

51
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:09,108
Why are you trying to be nasty?
Don't you think...

52
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:10,478
life is hard enough for us?

53
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:13,514
I may be reactionary...

54
00:06:13,552 --> 00:06:15,816
but this is absolutely
astounding.

55
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:20,621
The legal wife consoling
the mistress. No, no and no.

56
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:32,728
- What the hell are you both
doing here? - Nothing.

57
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,672
Nothing. Like kids. Nothing.

58
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:39,567
Come on and kiss me!

59
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,704
- Did you look at me?
- Are you still angry?

60
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,816
What about you, Cricri,
aren't you kissing your husband?

61
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:49,614
Let's see...

62
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:56,957
aren't you supposed to be
on break today?

63
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:59,088
I told her to stay.

64
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:01,759
- Don't you see how she looks?
- Exactly. She needs air.

65
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,234
And her shoes. Did you see
the soles?

66
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:08,137
I've always told her to buy
heavy shoes, the real things.

67
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,437
A sick person shouldn't worry
about her appearance.

68
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:13,706
- I'm not sick.
- She's delicate, you know it

69
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:18,079
Delicate? Yes, when she came
from Caracas.

70
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:21,312
Today, she's a cute little ruin.

71
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:24,413
She doesn't risk anything.
Ruins are indestructible

72
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:28,358
She'll bury us all. Won't you,
my little ruin?

73
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:30,361
That's enough. Go out and play
both of you.

74
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,768
Yes, a black little bottle.

75
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:43,673
She smelled it like that, and
it wasn't perfume.

76
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:46,007
I can tell you, they drink.

77
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:47,841
That's why they're always
together.

78
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,110
- What was in the bottle?
- Whiskey, idiot!

79
00:07:57,356 --> 00:07:59,881
Please, I don't want to hear
about that anymore.

80
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:05,162
Patard, if you want to spend
your vacation here...

81
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:07,097
you'll have all the time to draw.

82
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:14,633
M. Patard, you heard.

83
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:17,733
You won't go on vacation.

84
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:26,110
Miguel, what's the matter?

85
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,676
- I didn't want to punish him.
- So don't threaten him.

86
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,814
Patard did very well on
his English quiz.

87
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:34,257
That's not a reason to
disgrace himself.

88
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:41,091
I won't have any regrets.

89
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:56,003
No. I can't. I can't.

90
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:58,846
I wasn't even able to get
a divorce. So!

91
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:02,650
- Do you still love him?
- Of course not.

92
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:04,951
- You can't understand.
- Am I stupid?

93
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,084
- Divorce is a deadly sin.
- Really!

94
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:11,584
And what about the knife
you carried around for a month...

95
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,794
- Wasn't that a deadly sin?
- I was jealous. I was mad.

96
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:19,531
But to concoct this thing... No.

97
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:21,903
As you wish. But think about it.

98
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,170
We'll never find a better
opportunity.

99
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,473
And we have just three days.

100
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:29,742
Everyone knows I am leaving for
Niort. You'll come and rest.

101
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:33,979
- Don't you believe in hell?
- Not since I was seven.

102
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,646
I do.

103
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,401
- Fish again.
- Not fish again.

104
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:52,266
It's the same fish as
last night.

105
00:09:52,304 --> 00:09:55,205
- Make me two fried eggs.
- You're not gonna start, are you?

106
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,105
I put in a liter of vinegar
and a kilo of onions.

107
00:09:57,142 --> 00:10:00,043
I'm not saying it's bad. But,
you can smell that it's fish.

108
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:01,010
It stinks.

109
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,847
Yes, yes, later, later.

110
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:14,181
No, thank you.

111
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:16,820
- Help yourself.
- I'm not hungry.

112
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:19,990
You must set an example.
My liver doesn't allow me fat.

113
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:26,868
M. Delassalle, may I ask
for a glass of wine?

114
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:32,375
- You already had two.
- Only one. Only one.

115
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,775
Well.

116
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:48,625
"Bonum vinum laetificat
coro mini."

117
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:57,630
- What is it? A bone?
- I told you I wasn't hungry.

118
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,102
I'm asking you to eat.

119
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:14,112
- Swallow! - I can't help it.
I just can't.

120
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:15,619
Swallow.

121
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:23,183
- Delicious fish, M. Raymond?
- Perfect. Perfect.

122
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:27,927
It seems extremely nutritious.

123
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:34,099
What these gentlemen need,
is a little hard time.

124
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,630
Be quiet or I'll keep you all
here this weekend. Swallow.

125
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:49,148
Everyone is looking at you.
Swallow.

126
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:57,188
- It's disgusting.
- Sorry?

127
00:11:57,229 --> 00:11:58,321
Some things are hard to swallow.

128
00:11:58,363 --> 00:11:59,887
I'm not talking about the fish.

129
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:05,627
M. Drain, throw
these hooligans out of here.

130
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,070
What is this supposed to be?

131
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:10,404
You're going to eat your fish
and shut up.

132
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:13,673
- I told you to throw them out.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:26,153
- M. Raymond, go help
your colleague. - Yes, sir.

134
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:32,925
Get out, everybody. What is this?

135
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:41,465
Get out and be careful.

136
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:46,069
What kind of a supper is it
for these growing boys?

137
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:47,942
A slice of sausage and
two spoons of mashed potatoes?

138
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:49,571
They should've eaten what
they were served.

139
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:53,584
- In the army...
- You're not an adjutant

140
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:56,143
- But a soup merchant. - I can't
buy coalfish for 3000 francs.

141
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:58,155
You'd rather make them sick.

142
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,521
As a kid, we used to buy whiting.

143
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:02,890
Coalfish was too expensive.

144
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:04,918
They need expensive fish.
I buy it but...

145
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:06,954
at a price that I can afford.

146
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:09,694
It's a mistake to buy on sale.

147
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:11,861
The fishmonger is not as stupid
as we are. He knows.

148
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:14,599
It's not his money. It's mine.

149
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,664
I'm paying for everything here.

150
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,733
I'm paying for the doorkeeper.
And M. Drain.

151
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:21,371
I even paid Germaine, Sabine,
Therese.

152
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:24,644
I'm paying you too, Nicole.
I accept it.

153
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:28,346
But when the kids are involved,
it upsets me. I...

154
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:30,513
I can't stand it.

155
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:49,135
Calm down. It's not good for you.

156
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:54,176
I'd like to die, and not see
him anymore.

157
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:56,874
Die darling.
Die, and do it quickly.

158
00:13:56,915 --> 00:14:00,544
We'll have a nice funeral for you,
and we'll get rid of you.

159
00:14:00,585 --> 00:14:02,553
The school won't suffer...

160
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,919
and I'll feel much better.

161
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:08,892
Well, children, have fun.

162
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,919
I have to wake up early.
I'll go and pack.

163
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:16,864
Well, so...
I'm leaving at 7 A.M.

164
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:25,040
Have a nice vacation, darling.
Take care. See you, the other one.

165
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:28,441
Have a nice vacation!

166
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:32,816
A three day honeymoon.

167
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:50,032
Oh no. Oh no.

168
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,984
Nicole!

169
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:04,134
- Nicole! - I'm up here.
I'm coming down.

170
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:09,403
What are you doing?

171
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:15,835
Be careful. Move back.

172
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:41,927
Those riding the bus,
raise your hands.

173
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,401
Will your sister still be
in the bathroom?

174
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:47,570
If we get there before ten.
You'll see, I made a hole.

175
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,807
- Give me the pack back!
- You'll see my sister naked.

176
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:52,077
- It's worth a pack a cigarettes.
- No! Give them back to me!

177
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,710
Soudieu, aren't you part of
our group?

178
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:57,152
No. We'll share a cab,
the four of us.

179
00:17:57,188 --> 00:18:00,055
Money is pouring out of
your pockets.

180
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,495
Don't you have a suitcase,
de Gasquet?

181
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,623
The chauffeur will take it.
He's being paid for that.

182
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:14,703
Our personal chauffeurs don't do
their job right, dear friend.

183
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,975
Have a nice vacation, sir.

184
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,705
- You too
- Thank you.

185
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:26,378
Plantiveau, did madame come down?

186
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:30,210
I was ringing the bell when
they drove through the gate.

187
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:32,688
- I opened it.
- Both of them?

188
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:35,921
Madame Delassalle and
Mademoiselle Horner.

189
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,121
I thought you knew.

190
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:42,292
Of course, I knew. I just forgot.

191
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:47,999
Except that it's a problem.

192
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:52,768
Especially for these gentlemen.

193
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:56,336
One of you must stay to watch
those on detention.

194
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:13,225
- You'll feel funny about coming
back to Niort. - Why?

195
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:16,756
- That's where you had troubles
in high school. - Troubles...

196
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,894
I resigned, that's all.

197
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:21,097
- Do you still have your parents?
- No.

198
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,166
I've got a couple of teachers
living on the first floor.

199
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:28,007
- What? There are people in
the house? - I thought about it.

200
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:31,072
I thought about everything.
We are not risking a thing.

201
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:43,651
You're tired. Do you want me
to drive?

202
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:45,253
You can't drive.

203
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:47,287
I could never afford a car.

204
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:50,130
- This way, I cannot think.
- Good. So keep driving.

205
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:51,795
Keep your nerves for tomorrow.

206
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:53,736
We'll never have the courage.

207
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:58,242
- You don't know me.
- Yes, I know you very well.

208
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:01,712
You can wish someone's death,
but kill...

209
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:04,613
You must've wished my death,
didn't you?

210
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:08,278
I didn't. But he did.
He would say to me...

211
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,755
"Don't worry. With her heart
condition, it won't take long.

212
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,917
"After she dies, we'll share
the school."

213
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:16,788
It's horrible!
Don't you believe me?

214
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:18,853
What did you answer?

215
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,930
- Do you want me to be honest?
- Can you?

216
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:30,106
- I didn't know you that well...
- Don't talk.

217
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,802
I'd rather not know.

218
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:35,433
Watch the step.

219
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:44,406
MIle. Horner!
What a surprise!

220
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,349
Don't bother.

221
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:00,895
What a huge trunk.

222
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:03,730
It always upsets M. Herboux
when I take...

223
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:06,134
- more than a suitcase.
- Good evening.

224
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,107
Mme. Herboux, M.A. In grammar.
Mme. Delassalle, my principal.

225
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:14,578
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

226
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:17,012
Don't forget my rent.
By check, please.

227
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:19,744
Don't torture me.
I'm so embarrassed.

228
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:22,412
I thought of giving it to you
tomorrow or the day after.

229
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:26,389
But we didn't get paid for
the examinations in Vausson.

230
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:29,916
We were counting on that money.
But don't worry...

231
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:34,159
- I'll come tonight.
- No need. I'll come up tomorrow.

232
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:36,564
We're a little tired tonight.

233
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:39,035
Yes, she looks sick.

234
00:22:45,143 --> 00:22:46,974
Make yourself at home.

235
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:58,119
Home, sweet home.

236
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:01,648
Turn off the light. It's a waste.

237
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:11,000
- Already? - Let's do it now and
forget about it.

238
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:14,664
Hello, operator. I'd like
a line to St. Cloud.

239
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:18,039
The number is Molitor 27.45.
Thank you.

240
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:34,616
I like to have my feet free.
When it's cold...

241
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,059
I put on ski socks instead
of slippers.

242
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:52,102
Well, what are you waiting for?

243
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:55,571
You see, it doesn't bite.
And it doesn't slap either.

244
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:04,718
Hello? Who is it?
Answer, for God's sake!

245
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:08,959
It's you!

246
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:12,019
From Niort. My compliments!

247
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:14,293
Do you think I can afford to send
you away in the Poitou?

248
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:18,625
What about the gas?
What are you talking about?

249
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:21,763
I'm telling you that
we need to separate.

250
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:24,172
Yes, I want a divorce.

251
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:27,005
You are young, you are strong.

252
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:28,740
You can make a nice living.

253
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:36,112
The school was part of my dowry,
so I'll take it back.

254
00:24:36,154 --> 00:24:39,612
We'll start the proceedings
right after the holidays.

255
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,553
- What? - Don't give me that crap.
I'm coming.

256
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:46,119
I'll take a train
tomorrow morning.

257
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:47,631
I'll meet you at Nicole's.

258
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:59,702
- So? - He's coming tomorrow
on the evening train.

259
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:19,725
Well, Germaine?

260
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,642
You're nuts. You'll catch cold.

261
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:42,482
I'm not cold.
I'm suffocating.

262
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:05,200
- You've got fever.
- No, I'm just hot.

263
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:09,241
I thought you'd never come back.

264
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,975
That he'd get here before you.

265
00:26:11,015 --> 00:26:12,607
It doesn't always go
as you want it to.

266
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,912
That's life. Everything was
closed.

267
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:17,654
Did you buy a tablecloth?

268
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:22,216
Yes, a nylon, waterproof one.

269
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:27,687
- It's too big!
- It won't be big for him.

270
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:39,206
Guess how much?
2500 francs.

271
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:43,942
That's how they make money.
Let's open it.

272
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:45,744
That way it won't look weird.

273
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:53,986
Well, let's not waste it.

274
00:26:57,295 --> 00:27:01,391
- Here, it will cheer you up.
- No.

275
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:07,163
You should, it's not bad at all.
I've never had that before.

276
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:09,901
- You're supposed to put water in it.
- It would be a waste.

277
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:12,007
Hand me the small bottle.

278
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,683
- Won't he notice anything?
- Not a thing.

279
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:26,682
He'll sleep like a log.

280
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:30,558
- Will it leave any traces?
- None.

281
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:32,825
It's a sedative.
He'll digest it.

282
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:34,455
I'm sure he won't come.

283
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:43,263
That's him. That's his train.

284
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:45,070
Put that over there.

285
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:07,857
Stop, please, stop.

286
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:08,865
It's awful.

287
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:14,869
- We must fill it up.
- I can't do it.

288
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:17,669
I can't do it, not today.

289
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:22,708
We must do it, and you know it
as well as I do.

290
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:26,376
- It's either today or never.
- Then never!

291
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,783
Let's forget about it.
I can't handle this.

292
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:36,951
As you wish. But I must
warn you.

293
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:39,326
If you miss your chance
he won't miss his.

294
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:41,627
Not after your phone call.

295
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:47,263
I don't know. I just don't know
anymore.

296
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:51,571
Nicole, please, help me.

297
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:54,544
What for? It's beyond
your strength anyway.

298
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:57,979
I should have never trusted you.

299
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:01,109
I got involved too, and
you abandoned me.

300
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:04,121
Yes, you're right.
I'm not worth anything.

301
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:07,852
I'm just a ruin,
a little ruin.

302
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:11,760
That's what he said. But...

303
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:15,857
the little ruin will get
her revenge. She'll do it.

304
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,028
Even if she collapses afterward.

305
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,935
My only regret...

306
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:23,769
is that he'll never know
that I killed him.

307
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:28,142
Come on, before you were
giving up, now you're excited.

308
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,479
What you need is to relax.

309
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:36,247
Relax a lot. You must keep cool.

310
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:39,450
I will. I swear that I will.

311
00:29:44,495 --> 00:29:46,725
I must go upstairs and see them.

312
00:29:46,764 --> 00:29:48,959
Can't you stay with me?

313
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:51,729
If the Herbouxes look out
the window and...

314
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:55,261
- see him come in...
- You'll come right away, won't you?

315
00:29:55,306 --> 00:29:58,070
As fast as I can, I promise.

316
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:02,773
Be brave, in half an hour,
it will all be over.

317
00:30:35,913 --> 00:30:38,677
I'll find her a husband.
I'll redeem myself.

318
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:42,152
She's young, she'll be rich
and she'll be happy.

319
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:48,014
I wasn't expecting you tonight.

320
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:51,289
Mme. Delassalle is resting
and I'm not tired.

321
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,956
- May I come in?
- Please, do.

322
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:57,667
We were listening to the radio.
We've finished eating.

323
00:30:59,203 --> 00:31:02,138
The drama is over.

324
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:05,233
Zapi Max starts in a few seconds.

325
00:31:05,276 --> 00:31:07,767
Dear listeners, you've just heard...

326
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:11,908
"One Should Never Laugh
at Love" by Alfred de Musset.

327
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:45,137
God!

328
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:07,395
- Good evening, Michel.
- Good evening.

329
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:08,632
Come in.

330
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:22,818
So, are you proud of yourself?

331
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:25,014
Not so loud, the neighbors.

332
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:29,082
Don't worry. I don't want
to be noticed.

333
00:32:29,126 --> 00:32:31,390
A man who runs after his wife
is ridiculous enough.

334
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:36,030
I left the school like a thief.

335
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:40,264
I had to hide from Plantiveau.

336
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:43,000
Hiding from my own doorkeeper!

337
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,268
It's humiliating.

338
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:47,611
I couldn't tell him where
I was going.

339
00:32:49,713 --> 00:32:53,080
You have forced me to come,
what are you waiting for?

340
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:55,347
- What?
- Pack your bags.

341
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:58,586
- No!
- What?

342
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,987
- I'm staying.
- Are you refusing to come?

343
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:05,188
I thought that was clear.

344
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:07,060
I'll come back after our divorce.

345
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:11,363
- Have you decided to get a divorce,
you? - Yes.

346
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:13,734
With your religious beliefs?

347
00:33:13,771 --> 00:33:16,103
I won't get married again,
that's all.

348
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,166
But getting a divorce is
like getting married...

349
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:21,143
we must both agree.

350
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:25,342
- My lawyer doesn't think so.
- You have a lawyer?

351
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:29,981
- Attorney Berthoux, 64 Victor Hugo.
- Berthoux?

352
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,887
You can check in the phone book.

353
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:35,221
I went to see him this morning...

354
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:39,059
and he assured me that I'd get
the legal separation quickly.

355
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:41,758
He told you that?

356
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:44,462
Funny lawyer!

357
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:48,497
- Of course, I told him...
- You told him...

358
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:51,372
all of our secrets...
about our private life.

359
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:53,239
You told everything to
a stranger?

360
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:55,677
An animal who enjoyed
every word of it?

361
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:59,911
You, the former nun!

362
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,909
I'm telling you, it's
disgusting!

363
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:07,583
Didn't you talk about us
to your lovers?

364
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,786
Do we still have secrets?

365
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:12,022
Is there anything that Nicole
doesn't know?

366
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:15,862
Her! If you believe her!
Two words, three lies.

367
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,924
There are details that
she couldn't have invented.

368
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:21,131
She can invent anything!

369
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:24,265
God knows what she told
the lawyer!

370
00:34:24,308 --> 00:34:26,208
- I'll go see him, and put
things straight. - No!

371
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:28,973
- You won't stop me.
- No, later. Tomorrow.

372
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:31,106
- Right now, he must be having
supper -Well, I didn't eat.

373
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:32,581
- He won't receive you.
- We'll see.

374
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:33,981
When I tell him that I came
all the way from Paris...

375
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:38,921
Don't. I didn't see a lawyer.
I lied to you.

376
00:34:38,956 --> 00:34:43,893
You too. It's contagious.

377
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:52,597
So, what about the divorce,
was that a lie too?

378
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:57,699
No, I really want the divorce.
It's the only way.

379
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:01,370
For your sake as well, Michel.

380
00:35:01,412 --> 00:35:04,472
- It will be better for both
of us. - Come on, Cricri.

381
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:08,212
You can't be serious. Do you
know the price of a divorce?

382
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:11,813
- And what about the scandal?
- What scandal?

383
00:35:11,855 --> 00:35:15,723
I'll have to take a lawyer
to defend myself.

384
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:20,059
And lawyers never stop talking.

385
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:23,191
Parents won't entrust you with
their children.

386
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,530
- They'll take the children away
from me? - Of course.

387
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,764
You'll go bankrupt.
Not that I care much.

388
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:30,069
If it were up to me, I would
have sold it a long time ago.

389
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:33,838
With your money and my contacts
I'd have gone into business.

390
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:40,841
We could have lived comfortably.

391
00:35:42,653 --> 00:35:45,588
But you wanted this kid
business. I gave in.

392
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:49,456
- It was security.
- Big deal!

393
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:51,654
We traded in the big car for
a small one.

394
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:53,720
I gave up my training.

395
00:35:53,764 --> 00:35:56,164
I used my old suits.

396
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,794
We are rich and we live like
poor people.

397
00:35:58,836 --> 00:36:01,634
Do you know how I paid for
my trip?

398
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:05,332
I sold my dictionary,
my big dictionary.

399
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:12,011
And I did that for you.

400
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:14,142
Believe me that I don't regret
a thing.

401
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:16,880
But when you throw me out...

402
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,948
it upsets me, Cricri.
It upsets me a lot.

403
00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:26,359
But anyway, you made me feel
miserable.

404
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:29,695
We used to fight, like
every other couple.

405
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:34,796
Well, girls, what about this!

406
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:41,402
Wait. Don't lie. You mustn't
lie now.

407
00:36:41,445 --> 00:36:44,744
You made me very unhappy.

408
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:49,013
You might not have been aware
of that, but it's the truth.

409
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:51,077
- Ask Nicole.
- Please, don't talk about...

410
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:53,419
that bitch. She's setting you up
against me.

411
00:36:53,457 --> 00:36:55,857
She exploits the fact that
you're sick. She has a good mind.

412
00:36:55,892 --> 00:37:00,056
Yes. She's got knowledge,
taste...

413
00:37:00,097 --> 00:37:02,827
- Taste? - Maybe. But
she doesn't have a good mind.

414
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:04,663
That's it. I'm firing her
right away...

415
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:07,169
and we'll replace her with a man.
A good, honest, old man.

416
00:37:07,204 --> 00:37:09,968
- Michel! - For God's sake!
My Prince of Wales suit!

417
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:12,907
You idiot! Go get
a handkerchief, a towel!

418
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:14,604
It will stain and I'll
stink of alcohol.

419
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:17,139
Just go!

420
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:25,220
Here and here.

421
00:37:26,957 --> 00:37:30,324
It doesn't pay to be nice
to you.

422
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,191
I will break you, girl.

423
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,675
Well, what are you waiting for?

424
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:06,295
Bring some hot water.

425
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:20,235
We're leaving now and we'll be
back tomorrow morning.

426
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:23,371
How long did you have to drive?
Ten, twelve hours?

427
00:38:25,715 --> 00:38:26,773
Well, answer!

428
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:31,649
Can't you talk?

429
00:38:35,592 --> 00:38:40,723
Eh, woman, another glass!

430
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:50,569
I don't know... I feel dizzy.

431
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,175
You can't measure anymore.

432
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,712
That's enough.

433
00:39:05,622 --> 00:39:06,919
Nice color.

434
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:13,561
Stop looking at me with
your insane eyes.

435
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:18,198
Who's paying? The princess?

436
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:25,671
By the way, where is she?
Is she scared? Hiding?

437
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:28,542
She's upstairs visiting
the tenants.

438
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:31,945
Mademoiselle has tenants.
She never told me that.

439
00:39:36,653 --> 00:39:41,590
- I'm exhausted. It's the train.
- Just lie down.

440
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:47,960
- Whose bed is this? Hers or yours?
- Ours.

441
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,693
That's a scream.

442
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:54,098
Shoes. Take off my shoes.

443
00:40:02,512 --> 00:40:04,480
What's the matter with me
tonight?

444
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:18,159
I don't want to sleep.
I don't want to sleep.

445
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:23,123
We have to leave.

446
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:32,533
What are you doing?

447
00:40:36,513 --> 00:40:39,778
- Just sleep.
- Why did you turn off the light?

448
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:46,922
I'm so tired!

449
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:52,794
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Go to sleep.

450
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:03,929
- How did you get in?
- I came through this door.

451
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:06,704
- How many drinks did he have?
- Three.

452
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:10,270
He was very good.

453
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:21,219
He's dreaming.

454
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:44,012
He's ready. We can take him.

455
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,477
Take off his shoes.

456
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:06,758
- What the hell is she doing?
- She's taking a bath.

457
00:42:06,803 --> 00:42:10,534
At 10 P.M.? Funny habits.
Oh, shit!

458
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:16,201
Tell me, sir, where are the
Straits of Mozambique?

459
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:18,180
Between Madagascar and Africa!

460
00:42:18,214 --> 00:42:20,307
It is precisely located
between Madagascar...

461
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:22,580
and the Coast of Africa.
Bravo, sir!

462
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:28,050
32,000 francs!

463
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:30,616
I must ask you now:
What do you want to do?

464
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,925
- Do you stop or do you carry on?
- I will go on.

465
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:35,260
Of course, I carry on.

466
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:42,562
I was winning 32,000 francs and
I can't hear a thing now!

467
00:42:42,605 --> 00:42:47,201
- Poor baby! - Bitches! Bitches!
Daughters of bitches!

468
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:50,076
I didn't even hear the question!

469
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:53,742
Midnight baths! The decline
of Rome!

470
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:58,520
It's a problem of enjoyment!

471
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:01,149
I have the right to send her
a registered letter.

472
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:03,159
And I'm not saying that
I won't do it.

473
00:43:05,395 --> 00:43:12,324
The 17th at 10:05, 06 P.M.

474
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:17,402
- What are you looking for?
- His return ticket.

475
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:21,135
Here it is.

476
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:24,143
With the restaurant bill.

477
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:28,649
Burn it.

478
00:43:48,605 --> 00:43:53,099
Let's go. You take the feet.
It's lighter.

479
00:43:53,143 --> 00:43:54,167
Together.

480
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,823
The bronze...

481
00:44:44,027 --> 00:44:45,722
The bronze on the mantel

482
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:06,906
Give it to me.

483
00:45:12,222 --> 00:45:13,689
Now, the tablecloth.

484
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:18,382
The tablecloth.

485
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:53,823
It's over.

486
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:00,934
Did he suffer too much?

487
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:05,538
He didn't feel anything.

488
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:09,568
Let's go right away and bring
him back tonight.

489
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:11,978
What about our alibi?

490
00:46:12,015 --> 00:46:14,074
When they find him, we'll have
to be able to prove...

491
00:46:14,117 --> 00:46:16,711
that we were here the day
he died.

492
00:46:16,753 --> 00:46:19,347
That's why I'm using
the idiots upstairs.

493
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:21,789
She still hasn't emptied the tub.

494
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:24,622
- So what?
- So I can't go to sleep.

495
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:27,459
When she opens the drain,
the noise will start again.

496
00:46:27,497 --> 00:46:29,431
It won't fall on your bed.

497
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:31,592
I can't sleep under
Niagara Falls.

498
00:46:32,602 --> 00:46:35,799
- Are you planning to stay up
all night? - I'm sitting down.

499
00:46:39,776 --> 00:46:41,300
I'll give her until midnight.

500
00:46:59,662 --> 00:47:03,120
- Here they are!
- They took their time.

501
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,793
When I passed by the cafe,
at twelve...

502
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:06,927
they were already there.

503
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:09,403
They must know how much
it costs them.

504
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:12,408
- Lf you were a landlord, and
I a school principal... - Sure.

505
00:47:12,442 --> 00:47:14,672
We could also afford good meals.

506
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:18,038
Well, I'm going to take a nap.

507
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:24,348
Here we go, the flood!

508
00:47:49,812 --> 00:47:52,576
- What's the matter?
- He's so ugly!

509
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:06,323
I've had it! They must get
the hell out of here!

510
00:48:13,603 --> 00:48:16,128
Too bad you're leaving us
so soon.

511
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:18,037
It was so nice to have
company...

512
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:21,201
You know, school is starting
tomorrow.

513
00:48:21,244 --> 00:48:23,303
For us as well as for you.

514
00:48:23,346 --> 00:48:25,712
I just came to take my dishes.

515
00:48:25,748 --> 00:48:27,511
It's quite heavy.

516
00:48:30,887 --> 00:48:32,684
Wait a minute. Would you have
a piece of string?

517
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:35,282
A piece of string? No.

518
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:40,927
Wait. This might help you.

519
00:48:41,631 --> 00:48:43,098
I'll try, yes.

520
00:48:44,033 --> 00:48:46,399
Let me do it. It'll be easier
for you.

521
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,302
It won't work. Your trunk is
crammed too full.

522
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:52,705
- Let's take some things out.
- No, no.

523
00:48:52,742 --> 00:48:54,972
Yes. I'll bring you the old
tin trunk.

524
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:57,502
It's very strong. It went
through the 1940 retreat.

525
00:48:57,547 --> 00:49:00,846
- Start emptying the basket!
- No, it'll be fine.

526
00:49:00,883 --> 00:49:03,909
- We're already late, aren't we,
Nicole? - That's what I told them.

527
00:49:04,353 --> 00:49:07,754
Anyway, it's fine now.
We can load.

528
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,781
Attention! Clear the way!

529
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:15,693
On my command. One, two!

530
00:49:18,301 --> 00:49:21,429
Now, it'll be easy.
A little kick in the ass.

531
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:24,630
I'll start the engine.

532
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:33,407
- That's it!
- As you say!

533
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:35,883
M. Herboux,
thank you for your help.

534
00:49:35,918 --> 00:49:39,718
- Don't mention it.
- All the same...

535
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:42,815
- Here, this is for the road.
- Thank you, madame.

536
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:44,918
Drive carefully, the roads are
dangerous.

537
00:49:44,961 --> 00:49:46,986
They have mobilized 1500
policemen.

538
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:48,963
You'll find one at every
crossroad.

539
00:49:48,998 --> 00:49:51,728
Goodbye, madame.
And thank you again.

540
00:49:51,767 --> 00:49:53,735
- Have a good trip.
- See you soon!

541
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,660
It won't be this time.

542
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:22,892
- A little bit earlier, or later.
- Great...

543
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:24,763
There is only one possible end.

544
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,894
We are monsters.
I don't like monsters.

545
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:30,497
If it's only him, I feel better.
Because...

546
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,565
the grain of sand falling off
the hands of providence...

547
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:34,542
I'll keep that for
my Sunday school lesson.

548
00:50:46,923 --> 00:50:48,447
Well, don't stop!

549
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:58,830
It is about time!
All the gas stations were empty!

550
00:50:58,868 --> 00:51:01,428
No wonder! It was crazy today.

551
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:04,405
Wait. There is always some
left in the bottom.

552
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:11,378
- 963 francs. - I only have
a 5,000 franc bill.

553
00:51:11,414 --> 00:51:13,279
Come with me.
I'll get some change.

554
00:51:22,858 --> 00:51:26,316
- Are you going to Tours?
- No, I'm not.

555
00:51:26,362 --> 00:51:29,627
Could you give me a lift?

556
00:51:29,665 --> 00:51:32,793
The bus driver wouldn't
take me.

557
00:51:32,835 --> 00:51:35,861
He's anti-militarist, like me.

558
00:51:35,905 --> 00:51:38,601
We are already two. Can't you
see there's no room?

559
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:42,475
I won't take room.
A second class soldier.

560
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:46,345
If I don't report,
they'll put me in jail.

561
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:48,543
Have some pity for a soldier.

562
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:50,575
Leave me alone. You're drunk.

563
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,680
Me? Hey you!

564
00:51:53,723 --> 00:51:57,022
I'm being polite. And if
that's the way it is...

565
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:59,084
I'll just get into your car.

566
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:05,322
I won't let you. Do you hear me?

567
00:52:05,368 --> 00:52:10,499
Nicole! Would you get out!

568
00:52:11,307 --> 00:52:14,242
- What is it?
- Don't worry.

569
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:16,301
He's drunk. I know him.
He's not a bad guy.

570
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,279
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Robert.

571
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:22,850
Get out of here, or I'll push you
out myself.

572
00:52:32,561 --> 00:52:35,086
The pig. What did he do?

573
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:37,531
The floor is all wet.
I'll clean it.

574
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:40,364
No, no need. We're in a hurry.
Thank you.

575
00:52:42,805 --> 00:52:44,966
Start the car. There's a hole
in the nylon!

576
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:59,715
- Did you hear that?
- It sounds like the boss.

577
00:52:59,755 --> 00:53:02,724
- He decided to come back.
- It's about time!

578
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:09,727
Is this the time to make all
this racket?

579
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:12,256
If we only ring,
Plantiveau won't open.

580
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:14,394
Three short strokes,
that's Michel's signal.

581
00:53:14,437 --> 00:53:16,462
Plantiveau is a heavy sleeper.

582
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:18,132
I'll wake him up myself!

583
00:53:20,476 --> 00:53:25,311
- Come on Plantiveau!
- It's you?

584
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:27,676
I thought it was M. Delassalle.

585
00:53:27,717 --> 00:53:29,844
What? Isn't he here?

586
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:31,978
Do I know? Ask him when
you see him.

587
00:53:36,158 --> 00:53:39,650
- You look tired.
- Are you surprised?

588
00:53:42,932 --> 00:53:44,058
You can go.

589
00:53:49,939 --> 00:53:53,136
- Sorry to have awakened you.
Good night -Good night.

590
00:53:56,545 --> 00:53:58,342
Turn off the light.
For our number...

591
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,177
- we don't need spotlights.
- No music either!

592
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:58,363
Oh, not now.

593
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:15,044
- That's the bathroom light
- It's Pascual.

594
00:56:15,084 --> 00:56:17,518
I heard he gets up every night.

595
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:19,316
He might be able to look out
the window.

596
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:13,533
- Can we see him from here?
- No.

597
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:16,743
Either the water is too dirty,
or we're too far away.

598
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:23,113
I'm telling you that we can't
see anything.

599
00:57:26,155 --> 00:57:28,180
What's the point in staying here?

600
00:57:28,224 --> 00:57:30,089
We're not supposed to discover
the body.

601
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,766
- Close the window. It's freezing.
- Shut up. It stinks in here.

602
00:57:47,043 --> 00:57:49,375
Good news. The principal
didn't come back.

603
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:52,074
- He's in heat. - He's already got
two chicks. Isn't that enough?

604
00:57:52,114 --> 00:57:54,674
Of course, not. When I grow up,
I'll have a lot.

605
00:57:54,717 --> 00:57:57,515
Look at Napoleon and
Louis XIV.

606
00:57:57,553 --> 00:57:59,453
All the big men used to have
a lot of chicks.

607
00:57:59,488 --> 00:58:02,048
- Do you think you're Napoleon?
- I'm Falcon Eye.

608
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:08,824
M. Moinet, stop playing the fool.

609
00:58:08,865 --> 00:58:10,833
I'm not a fool.
I am an Indian.

610
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:12,835
Then you can write:
"My absurd comments provoke...

611
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:15,838
"my friends' hilarity",
20 times.

612
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:26,040
What do I hear?
The principal is missing?

613
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:28,277
This is the third time,
dear friend...

614
00:58:28,317 --> 00:58:30,308
that I drink my wine,
chemically pure.

615
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:34,016
Where is he? I saw him
the day before yesterday...

616
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:38,152
around eight o'clock. By
twelve, he was already gone.

617
00:58:38,194 --> 00:58:41,960
And he didn't show up again?

618
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:45,260
That's not like him.

619
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:49,965
Poor Mme. Delassalle.
She has enough troubles already.

620
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:53,601
If she's no more worried than
I am, he can stay where he is.

621
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:56,771
But believe me,
he'll be back soon.

622
00:58:56,846 --> 00:58:59,576
And we'll start drinking
bad wine again.

623
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:21,886
Did you notice?
This afternoon...

624
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:23,831
it seemed that he pretended
not to see the body.

625
01:00:23,866 --> 01:00:26,096
The body was at the bottom.

626
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:28,330
- Do you think it will rise?
- It has to.

627
01:00:29,972 --> 01:00:32,600
- When?
- How should I know?

628
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:36,008
- Tonight. Tomorrow morning.
- It makes me nervous.

629
01:00:37,813 --> 01:00:41,044
We cannot ask to empty the pool.
Try to understand.

630
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:43,574
It's natural to empty a pool
when the water is dirty.

631
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:46,087
What we find inside
won't be natural at all.

632
01:00:46,122 --> 01:00:48,352
I'll take the responsibility
for this.

633
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,450
In order to take responsibilities,
you have to be an adult.

634
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:51,585
You think like a child.

635
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:58,364
You're not worth anything.

636
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:03,294
How can you grade papers?

637
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:05,398
By mistake I just wrote
complete nonsense

638
01:01:05,441 --> 01:01:08,205
- Well, erase it.
- I don't have an eraser.

639
01:01:15,284 --> 01:01:18,515
If his body doesn't come up
by tomorrow...

640
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:20,784
I'll manage to have the pool
emptied.

641
01:01:20,823 --> 01:01:22,882
And I hope we won't regret it.

642
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:32,291
Don't bite your nails.

643
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,534
I was not in the game.

644
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:49,475
- Look!
- I was expecting that.

645
01:01:49,518 --> 01:01:51,315
Don't bring attention to it.

646
01:01:58,294 --> 01:02:00,888
- I told you not to look.
- Do something!

647
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,228
My heart is about to explode.
You promised yesterday.

648
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,028
Give me the keys. We'll move
things faster.

649
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:18,547
That was clever. Go and bring
the pole.

650
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:20,173
Me! Me! Me!

651
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:31,860
Soudieu! Let's test you
on a 100 meters.

652
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:39,062
As for you, you need
some training in the shot put.

653
01:02:40,102 --> 01:02:42,593
You're lucky. You have
a champion skin diver here.

654
01:02:42,638 --> 01:02:46,005
- Soudieu! I forbid you!
- Let him! He's a champion!

655
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,247
What's happening?
It's taking him too long.

656
01:03:00,289 --> 01:03:02,814
He might be drowning.
Did you see the bubbles?

657
01:03:05,094 --> 01:03:07,654
Did you get them?
Say something!

658
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:09,425
I found it. It was shining
in the mud.

659
01:03:09,465 --> 01:03:11,160
It looks like M. Delassalle's
lighter.

660
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,191
- And you didn't see...
- The keys!

661
01:03:14,136 --> 01:03:16,070
It's chocolate soup
at the bottom.

662
01:03:16,105 --> 01:03:18,665
Go get dressed. Don't catch
cold. We'll manage.

663
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,381
I think we'll have to empty
the pool.

664
01:03:29,785 --> 01:03:36,349
You're right.
Send Plantiveau over.

665
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,760
What are you waiting for?

666
01:03:57,546 --> 01:03:58,672
Plantiveau...

667
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,150
It's deep where you're standing.

668
01:04:10,192 --> 01:04:13,093
- It's all right. I can swim.
- So what?

669
01:04:13,162 --> 01:04:15,187
A lot of people who can swim
drown.

670
01:04:15,231 --> 01:04:17,927
Because the ones who can't
stay away from the edge.

671
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:21,903
- I want you to empty the pool.
- Right now?

672
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:25,434
I'm not dressed for it.
I was going to the barber.

673
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:29,905
Do it now, Plantiveau.
It's urgent.

674
01:04:29,945 --> 01:04:34,245
- Do it for me. - All right.
The fish will wait.

675
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:36,717
Only to empty
the pool will take an hour.

676
01:04:50,032 --> 01:04:52,193
She's upset. Be cool.

677
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:31,706
Why are you staring at me?
Is something wrong with me?

678
01:05:33,442 --> 01:05:37,037
Again. The surface of
a hexagon...

679
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:39,377
in relation to the radius
of the circumference?

680
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:45,384
Well, I'm waiting.

681
01:05:49,558 --> 01:05:50,582
I'm waiting...

682
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:58,626
- 6 AB x 1/2 OH. - Thank you.
Good. Go back to your seat.

683
01:06:01,136 --> 01:06:02,694
Take out your notebooks.

684
01:06:07,543 --> 01:06:09,636
Wait a minute. I'll be back soon.

685
01:06:32,401 --> 01:06:33,425
M. Plantiveau!

686
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:37,100
What happened to her?

687
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,102
It can't be true.
It's impossible!

688
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:46,137
- I didn't see well!
- You saw very well!

689
01:06:47,082 --> 01:06:49,915
- He isn't there anymore?
- No, he isn't.

690
01:06:52,788 --> 01:06:56,622
- Come in. What is it?
- It's the doctor, mademoiselle.

691
01:06:59,294 --> 01:07:03,025
I think it comes from
the open space, the empty pool.

692
01:07:03,065 --> 01:07:06,933
She suffers from agoraphobia,
and she got dizzy.

693
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:10,405
- It's possible.
- Nature abhors a vacuum.

694
01:07:10,439 --> 01:07:15,206
An empty pool isn't worth
a full bottle, Plantiveau.

695
01:07:19,648 --> 01:07:22,617
Is she feeling any better,
dear colleague?

696
01:07:22,651 --> 01:07:24,846
Dr. Loisy is with her.

697
01:07:24,887 --> 01:07:27,549
You'll take her pupils for
study hall, M. Raymond...

698
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:31,491
and you, M. Drain, watch
my class for a few minutes.

699
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:34,496
Mme. Delassalle might still
need me.

700
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:38,660
Of course. Did you notice?
She gives orders now.

701
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:46,241
- So, doctor?
- That's what we should all expect.

702
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:49,073
When it's used, it's used.
Where is the husband?

703
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:51,511
He should come here fast.

704
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:57,383
In the meantime, no emotions,
no vexations. Spare her.

705
01:07:57,419 --> 01:07:59,478
Don't you think a specialist...

706
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:02,012
If you want, I'll call Bridoux.

707
01:08:02,057 --> 01:08:04,548
He's 60 years old, but he's got
the best ear in Paris...

708
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:07,187
and he's the finest gourmet!
For him a meal is a meal.

709
01:08:09,498 --> 01:08:11,193
Anyway, give her some
digitalis.

710
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:30,213
- The doctor said... - I don't care.
Close the shutters and go.

711
01:08:30,252 --> 01:08:33,551
No. It would be too easy.
Much too easy.

712
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:40,694
Does a corpse that disappears
seem natural to you? Not to me.

713
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:43,095
If he's not in the pool,
someone took him out.

714
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:45,258
I asked Plantiveau if he
opened the door for anyone.

715
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,234
- He said no one.
- Why would he lie?

716
01:08:47,302 --> 01:08:51,932
If no one went out...

717
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:56,172
the body should be around here.
I've searched everywhere.

718
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:59,044
The attic, the basements,
the garden. There's nothing.

719
01:08:59,081 --> 01:09:02,107
No dirt, no footsteps.
There's nothing.

720
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:08,187
My head is about to explode.
It's crazy.

721
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,123
It's been crazy since
the beginning.

722
01:09:10,192 --> 01:09:12,422
Not even a kid's game.

723
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:14,429
You took one of your
word problems

724
01:09:14,463 --> 01:09:17,398
with leaking taps,
and tanks that empty...

725
01:09:17,432 --> 01:09:20,458
and you planned
a murder from it.

726
01:09:20,502 --> 01:09:24,598
In real life, this kind
of thing does not exist.

727
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:27,800
Bathtubs that we fill up,
swimming pools that we empty.

728
01:09:27,843 --> 01:09:30,869
That was crazy. And I was
crazy to listen to you.

729
01:09:32,347 --> 01:09:33,336
Come in!

730
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:42,990
Somebody brought back
monsieur's suit.

731
01:09:43,025 --> 01:09:45,493
The one he's been wearing
lately.

732
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:48,360
- The Prince of Wales.
- Who brought it back?

733
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:50,922
- The dry-cleaner.
- What dry-cleaner?

734
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:54,094
I don't know. He came
on a bicycle.

735
01:09:54,136 --> 01:09:56,001
He looked at the street name...

736
01:09:56,038 --> 01:09:58,268
and asked again if it was
the right address.

737
01:09:58,307 --> 01:10:00,138
A very conscientious
little guy.

738
01:10:00,175 --> 01:10:01,836
Get to the point.

739
01:10:02,678 --> 01:10:05,909
He said it was from
M. Delassalle.

740
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:10,214
So I asked him: "Did you see
M. Delassalle? Where?"

741
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:12,880
So he said:
"I didn't see him"...

742
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:15,617
but he asked me to bring
the suit home, urgently.

743
01:10:19,528 --> 01:10:22,224
Well, should I hang it up
in the closet?

744
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:23,856
No. Leave it here.

745
01:10:41,249 --> 01:10:42,341
It is his suit.

746
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:46,286
That's completely insane!

747
01:10:47,422 --> 01:10:48,150
Wait.

748
01:10:51,326 --> 01:10:52,759
Rue St. Ferdinand.

749
01:11:02,237 --> 01:11:04,569
- Good morning.
- Excuse me.

750
01:11:04,606 --> 01:11:07,803
Did you deliver a suit
this morning in St. Cloud?

751
01:11:07,843 --> 01:11:10,243
- What's the name?
- Mme. Delassalle.

752
01:11:10,278 --> 01:11:13,805
- Was there a problem?
- No. We just want to know who...

753
01:11:13,849 --> 01:11:17,945
- brought this suit to you.
- We see so many of them!

754
01:11:25,527 --> 01:11:29,361
If I remember well, it was
a tall thin man, dark hair...

755
01:11:29,398 --> 01:11:32,265
with a bamboo cigarette holder.

756
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:37,203
There's a check mark.
The kid forgot something.

757
01:11:39,608 --> 01:11:41,269
It was in his pocket.

758
01:11:43,945 --> 01:11:47,005
Eden Hotel. Room nine.

759
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:51,077
Your husband seems to be
leading some life!

760
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:54,555
I can have the kid bring
the key, if you wish.

761
01:11:54,589 --> 01:11:56,318
Do you know this hotel, madam?

762
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:59,657
It's a residential hotel.
Very cozy.

763
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:00,627
Come on!

764
01:12:03,565 --> 01:12:05,829
First street on the right.
Number 27.

765
01:12:13,408 --> 01:12:15,342
- I'll go.
- What if they ask you something?

766
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:17,470
It looks like
they don't ask questions here.

767
01:12:17,512 --> 01:12:20,572
Don't go, it's a trap. Someone
wants to blackmail us.

768
01:12:20,615 --> 01:12:22,446
At least, we'll know with whom
we are dealing.

769
01:13:34,856 --> 01:13:40,351
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for M. Delassalle.

770
01:13:40,428 --> 01:13:43,488
He's never here during
the day.

771
01:13:43,532 --> 01:13:48,231
- When does he come back?
- Who knows if he comes back at all.

772
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:55,904
His bed is always neat. See,
no belongings, no bags.

773
01:13:56,545 --> 01:14:00,140
Nothing. Some weird guest.

774
01:14:05,987 --> 01:14:07,113
Did you ever see him?

775
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,453
Never, neither did
the doorkeeper.

776
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:11,288
He must come, after I leave...

777
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:12,918
and before the other guy
starts his shift.

778
01:14:12,961 --> 01:14:15,930
But, why all these questions?

779
01:14:15,964 --> 01:14:19,365
He's my husband.
I am Mme. Delassalle.

780
01:14:19,401 --> 01:14:24,464
Poor lady! This isn't where
you should look for him.

781
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:27,998
You can trust me. His life
is somewhere else.

782
01:14:34,749 --> 01:14:37,616
It's scary. What's happening
to us?

783
01:14:37,652 --> 01:14:40,212
I don't know.
No one knows.

784
01:14:40,288 --> 01:14:41,619
It doesn't make any sense.

785
01:14:43,124 --> 01:14:47,686
80,000 francs. Shower repair,
and it's two years old.

786
01:14:47,729 --> 01:14:50,220
Ah, this time it smells
the bailiff.

787
01:14:50,265 --> 01:14:53,291
Pay them half. It's already
something.

788
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:02,939
- He was really dead, wasn't he?
- You're the one who should know.

789
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:08,416
- Why are you saying that?
- You killed him, didn't you?

790
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:13,387
- Me? - You are the one
who planned the whole thing.

791
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:17,016
I'm sorry, we planned it...

792
01:15:17,058 --> 01:15:18,821
and you made the phone call.

793
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,487
You bought the tablecloth
to wrap him...

794
01:15:20,528 --> 01:15:22,189
the drug to put him
to sleep.

795
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:23,925
I would have been unable
to do that.

796
01:15:23,965 --> 01:15:27,093
- But you made him drink!
- You liar! I didn't want to!

797
01:15:27,135 --> 01:15:29,035
You know I didn't want to!

798
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:30,697
You could've let him sleep
his whiskey off...

799
01:15:30,772 --> 01:15:32,399
instead of carrying him
to the tub.

800
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,534
Who filled up the tub?
Who pushed him under water?

801
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,340
And who brought the bronze
from the mantel?

802
01:15:39,047 --> 01:15:40,014
It's too easy.

803
01:15:41,783 --> 01:15:43,876
You'll see whom the court will
hold responsible.

804
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:46,046
- You'll see.
- The court doesn't scare me.

805
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:48,055
We'll get what we deserve.

806
01:15:48,089 --> 01:15:51,388
Well, suit yourself!
Go to the police! Go!

807
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:55,385
- I thought of that.
- To put the whole thing on me!

808
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:58,922
I won't let this happen.
I'll call the cops first!

809
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:04,830
Call them, but I'm warning you,
I'll tell them everything!

810
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:11,574
I have nothing to hide.
You were jealous, and killed him.

811
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:13,945
And I helped you because
I felt pity for you.

812
01:16:13,982 --> 01:16:17,884
You were jealous because
it was over between you two.

813
01:16:17,919 --> 01:16:20,410
You killed him,
and you know it!

814
01:16:23,758 --> 01:16:26,522
So, what are you waiting for?

815
01:16:52,053 --> 01:16:53,782
- Do you have my newspapers?
- Yes.

816
01:16:55,222 --> 01:16:57,122
Be careful not to get dirty.
The ink is still wet.

817
01:17:04,565 --> 01:17:08,057
- Christina!
- I have nothing to tell you.

818
01:17:09,603 --> 01:17:12,902
- Where are you going?
- To confession. Do you mind?

819
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:15,773
Do you think you'll get absolution
if you don't turn yourself in?

820
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:19,143
- So I'll turn myself in.
- What about me?

821
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,647
I can't keep this up.

822
01:17:23,818 --> 01:17:26,150
Come on, don't worry.
It's all over.

823
01:17:26,187 --> 01:17:30,886
They found the body.
Read this.

824
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,319
"A Naked Corpse in the Seine"

825
01:17:35,362 --> 01:17:39,765
- Why in the Seine? - What counts
is that they found him.

826
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,325
Everything fits.
The description...

827
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,633
The Bois de Boulogne bridge
which is very close...

828
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:48,608
a three day old death.
Our alibi is holding up.

829
01:17:50,611 --> 01:17:52,169
They brought him to the morgue.

830
01:18:08,062 --> 01:18:12,624
I read this, and I think
it's my husband.

831
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:14,760
Identity card.

832
01:18:21,675 --> 01:18:24,269
Could you describe
M. Delassalle?

833
01:18:25,212 --> 01:18:29,615
Dark hair, thin, dark eyes.

834
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:33,416
All this has already been written
in the paper. It's too easy.

835
01:18:33,454 --> 01:18:37,857
- I want details.
- What do you want to know?

836
01:18:37,892 --> 01:18:39,883
I don't know. You tell me.

837
01:18:39,927 --> 01:18:41,690
If you tell me he had
an appendectomy...

838
01:18:41,729 --> 01:18:45,358
- it's a detail.
- He's had the operation.

839
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:48,994
- Dentition. How many teeth?
- All of them, I think.

840
01:18:49,036 --> 01:18:52,938
- Fillings?
- Maybe one or two.

841
01:18:52,973 --> 01:18:55,635
- One or two?
- Two.

842
01:18:55,676 --> 01:18:57,974
- Beauty marks?
- Yes.

843
01:18:58,012 --> 01:19:00,480
- Where?
- On his shoulder.

844
01:19:00,514 --> 01:19:03,312
Why didn't you tell me
he had a bracelet?

845
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:06,513
- He never had one!
- Really!

846
01:19:08,889 --> 01:19:11,983
- What do you see on
his right thigh? - Nothing.

847
01:19:12,026 --> 01:19:14,494
Try to think, above the knee.

848
01:19:14,528 --> 01:19:18,225
I can't see anything.
So it must be a mistake.

849
01:19:22,736 --> 01:19:27,901
Bring up number 4702.
You were right.

850
01:19:27,942 --> 01:19:30,206
No bracelet and
nothing above the knee.

851
01:20:59,099 --> 01:21:01,727
Please, follow me
to the identification room.

852
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,514
- It's not him.
- Are you sure?

853
01:21:49,516 --> 01:21:52,747
- Yes! - I'm sorry, madame.
This rarely happens.

854
01:22:17,244 --> 01:22:20,839
Taxi! To St. Cloud!

855
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:23,941
St. Cloud? Now?
Are you out of your mind?

856
01:22:23,984 --> 01:22:26,509
I don't want to have supper
on a merry-go-round!

857
01:22:26,754 --> 01:22:27,482
Excuse me...

858
01:22:35,562 --> 01:22:37,621
Here we go!

859
01:22:37,664 --> 01:22:41,065
Aren't you feeling well, lady?
Maybe it's the emotion.

860
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:44,434
The reaction only comes after,
doesn't it?

861
01:22:45,205 --> 01:22:48,231
You should feel better since
it's not him.

862
01:22:48,275 --> 01:22:49,742
Drive.

863
01:22:57,918 --> 01:23:02,252
Do you feel better?
Let me introduce myself.

864
01:23:02,289 --> 01:23:04,985
Alfred Fichet,
retired police commissioner.

865
01:23:05,025 --> 01:23:07,960
But I didn't ask the police
for anything!

866
01:23:08,028 --> 01:23:11,293
Didn't you inform
the police commissioner?

867
01:23:11,331 --> 01:23:15,427
It was a mistake.
That's what they are for.

868
01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:19,166
I didn't think about it.
I'll do it.

869
01:23:19,206 --> 01:23:23,267
I'll do it myself. Just
out of principle.

870
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:26,677
One should not expect too much
from the regular police.

871
01:23:26,713 --> 01:23:28,977
The police are too busy.

872
01:23:29,016 --> 01:23:32,850
No. If you'd like, we are both
going to find your husband.

873
01:23:32,886 --> 01:23:36,549
40 years on the job,
it's not to be ignored.

874
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:39,081
Now, I have plenty of time.

875
01:23:39,126 --> 01:23:43,028
- No. Really, it's not necessary.
- What do you risk?

876
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:46,055
If I don't find anything,
you won't pay me anything.

877
01:23:46,099 --> 01:23:50,092
And if I find something...
well, you'll judge for yourself.

878
01:23:50,137 --> 01:23:54,233
You can't ask for a better deal.
Let's see.

879
01:23:54,274 --> 01:23:58,836
- You've been married...
- Eight years.

880
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:03,816
- I don't understand what...
- Leave it to me. I know.

881
01:24:03,851 --> 01:24:06,342
We are saying eight years.

882
01:24:10,491 --> 01:24:12,254
It's boiling, mademoiselle.

883
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:15,858
- How long do you think
it can boil? - Five minutes.

884
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:47,151
How do I know.
He had his own keys.

885
01:24:47,194 --> 01:24:50,220
He would go in, and out.
He was the boss.

886
01:24:50,264 --> 01:24:51,993
And it was vacation anyway.

887
01:24:55,035 --> 01:25:01,167
- Was he a little low-spirited?
- It was not his style.

888
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:03,233
It was more in his nature
to complicate his life.

889
01:25:03,277 --> 01:25:06,246
- Maybe he was feeling sick.
- Couldn't be.

890
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,215
The man was very strong.

891
01:25:09,249 --> 01:25:11,479
When he was younger, he was
a tennis champion.

892
01:25:11,518 --> 01:25:15,147
Did he get a telegram
on Sunday?

893
01:25:15,188 --> 01:25:20,091
A phone call? Sometimes, people
leave after a phone call.

894
01:25:20,127 --> 01:25:22,095
I can't tell you, sir.

895
01:25:22,129 --> 01:25:24,393
This Sunday I took my wife
to the park...

896
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:27,093
and when the school is closed,
we seize the opportunity.

897
01:25:27,134 --> 01:25:29,694
There might be the hypothesis
of the accident.

898
01:25:29,736 --> 01:25:33,968
Did M. Delassalle used
to drive fast, very fast?

899
01:25:34,007 --> 01:25:36,771
He didn't have the car.
The women took it to Niort.

900
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:40,610
That's right. Don't you think
he could've drowned?

901
01:25:40,647 --> 01:25:44,174
Drowned? He was a real fish.

902
01:25:44,217 --> 01:25:47,414
This man could swim.

903
01:25:47,454 --> 01:25:51,151
I see. Well, thank you.

904
01:25:52,893 --> 01:25:57,887
The Alps separate Italy from
France in the southeast.

905
01:25:57,931 --> 01:26:01,332
The Alps are very high
mountains.

906
01:26:01,368 --> 01:26:05,634
There is Mont-Blanc,
the highest mountain in Europe.

907
01:26:05,672 --> 01:26:08,232
In the east, there is the Jura...

908
01:26:08,275 --> 01:26:10,971
That is quite reassuring.

909
01:26:11,011 --> 01:26:13,912
I think you worried
a little bit too early.

910
01:26:13,947 --> 01:26:17,041
On Saturday, your husband
was still here.

911
01:26:17,084 --> 01:26:21,350
It's only been five days, and
you go look for him at the morgue.

912
01:26:21,388 --> 01:26:23,618
The article in the paper
upset me.

913
01:26:23,657 --> 01:26:26,990
A 30 year old man,
one meter seventy...

914
01:26:27,027 --> 01:26:30,895
Dear madame, there are 100,000
men in Paris who fit...

915
01:26:30,931 --> 01:26:35,231
this description. And this
doesn't include the tourists.

916
01:26:35,268 --> 01:26:39,796
I guess you were thinking
of suicide.

917
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,240
Yes. Well, I don't know.

918
01:26:42,309 --> 01:26:45,904
To commit suicide in the Seine,
one doesn't need to undress.

919
01:26:45,946 --> 01:26:51,885
My hypothesis is much less
tragic.

920
01:26:51,918 --> 01:26:54,478
When I say hypothesis,
I mean...

921
01:26:54,521 --> 01:26:58,355
A woman! Of course, you're right.

922
01:26:58,392 --> 01:27:00,826
I was stupid to worry and
to bother you.

923
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:04,524
- Take this.
- No, no. I won't steal your money.

924
01:27:04,564 --> 01:27:06,691
Remember our agreement.

925
01:27:06,733 --> 01:27:09,429
If I don't find out anything,
you don't owe me anything.

926
01:27:09,469 --> 01:27:12,267
But, don't worry, I'll find him.

927
01:27:17,844 --> 01:27:20,404
I haven't been
in a school for a long time.

928
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:24,179
In my days, it was
the local school. Charonne.

929
01:27:25,652 --> 01:27:27,586
Less fancy. Much less fancy.

930
01:27:28,722 --> 01:27:31,122
Ah, it was really different.

931
01:27:37,597 --> 01:27:43,900
You emptied the pool.
You thought about this too.

932
01:27:43,937 --> 01:27:46,997
- Not at all!
- Why not at all?

933
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,304
I dropped my keys in the pool.

934
01:27:49,342 --> 01:27:51,708
- So in order to get them back...
- When was that?

935
01:27:51,745 --> 01:27:56,079
- Yesterday. - Commissioner
Fichet. MIle. Horner.

936
01:27:56,116 --> 01:28:00,610
- Our most devoted associate.
- Hello.

937
01:28:00,654 --> 01:28:04,784
It was pure coincidence.

938
01:28:04,825 --> 01:28:09,762
Really, the keys in the pool,
the husband in the morgue...

939
01:28:09,796 --> 01:28:13,391
You dream too much about water
in this house!

940
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:16,533
May I look at his mail?

941
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:19,368
- You'll never find him.
- How do you know anyway?

942
01:28:21,341 --> 01:28:24,037
- I see he has a typewriter.
- Yes, for the accounts.

943
01:28:28,682 --> 01:28:31,583
You're right. M. Delassalle
is not a literary man.

944
01:28:33,487 --> 01:28:35,819
Perhaps he doesn't trust
his spelling.

945
01:28:39,793 --> 01:28:45,663
May I? I seriously can't
imagine him that desperate.

946
01:28:46,566 --> 01:28:49,126
Let's take this seriously.

947
01:28:50,003 --> 01:28:55,805
So we're saying:
Delassalle Michel...

948
01:28:56,643 --> 01:29:01,239
- 34 years old...
- One meter seventy.

949
01:29:01,281 --> 01:29:08,551
- Yes, I know. Dark hair. Eyes?
- Brown.

950
01:29:12,692 --> 01:29:18,790
Average nose, ears... folded in.

951
01:29:19,666 --> 01:29:23,625
How to find someone with
this description?

952
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:28,004
Well, we'll find him.
These pigs are so strong!

953
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:31,169
What was he wearing
the day he disappeared?

954
01:29:33,146 --> 01:29:35,546
We were away that day, sir.

955
01:29:35,582 --> 01:29:39,416
Of course! How stupid of me.

956
01:29:39,452 --> 01:29:42,250
Here's what we'll do.

957
01:29:42,289 --> 01:29:44,553
We'll look into
his wardrobe...

958
01:29:44,591 --> 01:29:46,218
and we'll see what is missing.

959
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:52,425
One, two, three,
four, five, six. Six.

960
01:29:53,867 --> 01:29:59,328
- What did the 7th pair look like?
- Brown suede.

961
01:30:01,808 --> 01:30:05,642
- Tie?
- Red, with a white stripe.

962
01:30:06,546 --> 01:30:10,004
You're sharp-eyed. He's got
at least 25 ties.

963
01:30:11,585 --> 01:30:12,916
So, suit?

964
01:30:17,257 --> 01:30:18,690
Suit!

965
01:30:20,827 --> 01:30:24,194
So you know his ties
better than his suits.

966
01:30:24,231 --> 01:30:26,825
I think it's a Prince of Wales,
grey.

967
01:30:29,502 --> 01:30:31,367
Prince of Wales, grey.

968
01:30:43,516 --> 01:30:46,076
- Like this one?
- Yes.

969
01:30:48,455 --> 01:30:52,118
- Wait a minute.
- Is something wrong?

970
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:56,094
Mme. Delassalle has a heart
condition. We must spare her.

971
01:30:56,763 --> 01:30:59,732
You should have told me.

972
01:30:59,766 --> 01:31:02,860
It's not that urgent. I've got
enough to keep myself busy.

973
01:31:02,903 --> 01:31:05,371
Take care of yourself.

974
01:31:05,405 --> 01:31:07,805
I'll go visit downtown.

975
01:31:07,874 --> 01:31:09,432
I still have friends there.

976
01:31:12,379 --> 01:31:15,007
And don't worry. I'll be back.

977
01:31:20,053 --> 01:31:23,420
- Plantiveau said he's a detective.
- A private one.

978
01:31:23,456 --> 01:31:27,859
Everybody to the firing squad!

979
01:31:29,362 --> 01:31:33,492
Heberge, if you're done with
your work...

980
01:31:33,533 --> 01:31:35,626
I'll find something else
for you to do.

981
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:39,605
First, Latin. When the Middle Ages
lost everything...

982
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:43,302
they still knew Latin.
The Church understood it.

983
01:31:43,376 --> 01:31:46,402
The last village priest
knew Latin.

984
01:31:46,446 --> 01:31:48,346
I don't think that
the average priest...

985
01:31:48,381 --> 01:31:50,178
is that clever.

986
01:31:50,216 --> 01:31:55,176
It's not his job.

987
01:31:55,221 --> 01:31:59,282
M. Moinet, what are you
doing here?

988
01:31:59,326 --> 01:32:01,760
Aren't you supposed
to be studying?

989
01:32:01,795 --> 01:32:04,320
- The principal punished me.
- Who?

990
01:32:04,364 --> 01:32:07,697
- The principal.
- What are you talking about?

991
01:32:07,734 --> 01:32:11,693
- It's the truth.
- What did you do?

992
01:32:11,738 --> 01:32:13,968
I broke a window.

993
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:17,909
Maybe the principal came back.

994
01:32:17,944 --> 01:32:21,812
Stop talking nonsense.
Tell me the truth, now.

995
01:32:21,848 --> 01:32:23,338
- Who punished you?
- The principal.

996
01:32:25,585 --> 01:32:28,383
- That's for lying!
- I'm not lying.

997
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:31,151
Let me handle this.
You're scaring him.

998
01:32:31,191 --> 01:32:35,321
Tell me your story again.

999
01:32:35,362 --> 01:32:38,422
And if you tell everything,
I'll lift your punishment.

1000
01:32:39,332 --> 01:32:41,596
- How did you break the window?
- With my slingshot.

1001
01:32:41,634 --> 01:32:45,365
- Then what happened?
- The principal opened the door...

1002
01:32:45,405 --> 01:32:47,236
and told me to go to bed
right away...

1003
01:32:47,273 --> 01:32:49,537
without picking up
the dead leaves.

1004
01:32:49,676 --> 01:32:51,610
It can't be him.
It's impossible.

1005
01:32:51,644 --> 01:32:53,805
You know he's not here.

1006
01:32:53,847 --> 01:32:56,645
You forget that this kid
is a pathological liar.

1007
01:32:56,683 --> 01:32:58,412
Last week, he told his friends
he had a fight...

1008
01:32:58,451 --> 01:33:01,215
with a lion at the fair.
With a lion!

1009
01:33:01,788 --> 01:33:04,018
He's a mythomaniac.
I just asked the other kids.

1010
01:33:04,057 --> 01:33:06,651
Nobody saw the principal.

1011
01:33:06,693 --> 01:33:09,321
But there really is
a broken window in the corridor.

1012
01:33:09,362 --> 01:33:11,853
He punished himself in order
to create this story.

1013
01:33:11,898 --> 01:33:14,093
Who knows? Obviously...

1014
01:33:14,134 --> 01:33:16,568
this is a case of
self-induced hallucination.

1015
01:33:16,603 --> 01:33:19,197
The kid broke a window
and in his subconscious...

1016
01:33:19,239 --> 01:33:21,400
he generated the idea
of punishment...

1017
01:33:21,441 --> 01:33:23,739
to match the principal's.

1018
01:33:23,777 --> 01:33:25,836
Darkness did the rest.

1019
01:33:25,879 --> 01:33:28,279
- Do you really think so?
- No. The kid saw himself...

1020
01:33:28,314 --> 01:33:30,111
being punished in the literal
sense of the word.

1021
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:32,710
I think he's kidding us...

1022
01:33:32,752 --> 01:33:35,186
in the literal sense of the word.

1023
01:33:35,255 --> 01:33:38,588
- Give me your slingshot.
- The principal took it.

1024
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:45,094
Don't you think you're a little
out of line?

1025
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:49,996
I feel tired. I'm going
to sleep.

1026
01:33:50,036 --> 01:33:52,698
- Suit yourself.
- Goodnight.

1027
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:57,767
Goodnight. Go get some rest.

1028
01:33:57,811 --> 01:34:02,475
M. Moinet. We've been
patient enough.

1029
01:34:02,515 --> 01:34:04,380
If you want to be stubborn...

1030
01:34:04,417 --> 01:34:06,282
go straight to the corner.

1031
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:09,755
You'll get out only
after you tell the truth.

1032
01:34:09,789 --> 01:34:14,192
We'll see who gets tired
first.

1033
01:34:14,227 --> 01:34:17,253
I saw him. I saw him.

1034
01:34:24,204 --> 01:34:30,803
- Moinet couldn't have brought
this slingshot. - Certainly not.

1035
01:34:31,244 --> 01:34:34,873
- So who could've done that?
- It could be anyone.

1036
01:34:35,882 --> 01:34:38,407
- It's a coincidence.
- Coincidence!

1037
01:34:39,219 --> 01:34:42,746
Fichet at the morgue,
was a coincidence.

1038
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:48,022
And the suit, and the hotel,
and now the students.

1039
01:34:48,061 --> 01:34:50,723
Is it a coincidence that
it's getting closer each time?

1040
01:34:50,763 --> 01:34:53,960
Please, calm down. My nerves
are going as well.

1041
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,766
It's all getting clear.
There are no miracles in life.

1042
01:34:57,804 --> 01:34:59,396
Unfortunately.

1043
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:01,930
Each time I close my eyes...

1044
01:35:01,975 --> 01:35:03,966
it seems that I'm going to see
him.

1045
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:07,639
Don't talk. He must already
be in some condition.

1046
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:12,117
Yes, if he's dead.

1047
01:35:12,152 --> 01:35:15,781
Listen, I've seen dead people
in my life.

1048
01:35:15,822 --> 01:35:18,382
Believe me, Michel is dead.
Really dead.

1049
01:35:18,424 --> 01:35:20,255
Lie down and try not to think
of anything.

1050
01:35:20,293 --> 01:35:22,761
With all I have on my mind...

1051
01:35:22,795 --> 01:35:25,730
If you don't get any sleep,
you won't last three days.

1052
01:35:25,765 --> 01:35:28,598
Dr. Loisy is very worried.

1053
01:35:28,635 --> 01:35:31,160
He asked Prof. Bridoux
to come tomorrow.

1054
01:35:33,706 --> 01:35:34,502
There you are!

1055
01:35:35,975 --> 01:35:39,843
What's the point now?
I'm finished.

1056
01:35:43,349 --> 01:35:45,749
- Stop that.
- Give me back my marbles.

1057
01:35:45,785 --> 01:35:47,719
- I don't have them.
- You took them, I know.

1058
01:35:47,754 --> 01:35:49,585
- I'm going to break your neck!
- Leave me alone!

1059
01:35:49,622 --> 01:35:51,556
- Give him back his marbles.
- Leave me alone.

1060
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:55,823
- I haven't got them. Stop it!
- Come on, come on!

1061
01:35:55,862 --> 01:36:01,494
You can fight, but don't scream.
Mme. Delassalle is very sick.

1062
01:36:09,075 --> 01:36:14,103
Moinet, your punishment is
lifted... for now.

1063
01:36:14,147 --> 01:36:17,275
- Go for your picture.
- Thank you, sir.

1064
01:36:30,797 --> 01:36:34,255
A picture without the principals,
is not a school picture.

1065
01:36:34,334 --> 01:36:37,235
We'll do better next year.
Come on, children.

1066
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:42,331
Do we put the bench in front
of the window?

1067
01:36:42,408 --> 01:36:44,603
- Why not in front of the door?
- What about the car?

1068
01:36:44,644 --> 01:36:47,135
There is a professor
from the university upstairs.

1069
01:36:48,414 --> 01:36:50,678
I must go. It's part of the job.

1070
01:36:50,717 --> 01:36:53,151
I'll show the professor out,
and I'll call you.

1071
01:37:01,194 --> 01:37:04,186
You overdid it.

1072
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:07,631
You should really have a good rest.

1073
01:37:07,667 --> 01:37:11,103
- Will I be able to get up?
- We'll talk about this later.

1074
01:37:11,137 --> 01:37:15,267
- You will be fine here.
- Could I go out into the yard?

1075
01:37:15,308 --> 01:37:18,209
- Is it too much for me?
- Until the doctors say so...

1076
01:37:18,244 --> 01:37:20,212
you are not supposed to move.

1077
01:37:23,149 --> 01:37:27,882
Let's do it. Look at my hand.
Don't move.

1078
01:37:27,954 --> 01:37:32,448
One, two. Thank you. One minute.
I'll take another one.

1079
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:42,859
You can go through.

1080
01:37:46,273 --> 01:37:48,741
Taking her to my clinic
would have been too expensive.

1081
01:37:48,775 --> 01:37:50,606
Between you and me,
there are no heirs.

1082
01:37:50,644 --> 01:37:52,635
I know. But people dying
in the clinic...

1083
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:54,806
the hearse in front of the door,
I don't like that.

1084
01:37:56,583 --> 01:37:58,175
Neither do the patients.

1085
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:06,090
- Let me see! - Be careful, kids.
It's still wet.

1086
01:38:07,794 --> 01:38:09,819
Great. Nobody moved.

1087
01:38:09,863 --> 01:38:12,491
Please... I came out fine.

1088
01:38:12,532 --> 01:38:15,023
This is the first time I've
had the position of honor.

1089
01:38:15,068 --> 01:38:18,094
When I show the picture,
they'll think I'm the principal.

1090
01:38:18,138 --> 01:38:20,402
- What do I see behind
the window? - Looks like the boss.

1091
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,068
- You're nuts!
- Wait! Let me put my monocle on.

1092
01:38:23,109 --> 01:38:25,669
- Let me see, mademoiselle!
- Leave me alone!

1093
01:38:28,982 --> 01:38:31,678
- I didn't see anything?!
- You didn't miss anything.

1094
01:38:31,718 --> 01:38:34,414
It's some kind of shot-silk
effect.

1095
01:38:34,454 --> 01:38:36,581
The reflection of a cloud or
some spot on the window...

1096
01:38:36,623 --> 01:38:38,454
that reminds us of
the principal's features.

1097
01:38:38,491 --> 01:38:40,083
Maybe it's him!

1098
01:38:40,126 --> 01:38:42,390
He didn't want to interrupt us...

1099
01:38:42,429 --> 01:38:46,195
or this was just an innocent joke.

1100
01:38:46,233 --> 01:38:48,292
I can't see Delassalle playing
hide-and-seek.

1101
01:38:48,335 --> 01:38:52,169
But you, didn't you see
anything?

1102
01:38:52,205 --> 01:38:55,106
I was looking at the group,
being sure to see everybody.

1103
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:58,338
Let's settle this once and
for all. Moinet.

1104
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:04,175
You're such a great observer.
Did you see the principal?

1105
01:39:04,284 --> 01:39:07,310
Six hours in the corner,
thank you, that's enough!

1106
01:39:07,354 --> 01:39:09,584
The case is closed.
There wasn't anyone.

1107
01:39:09,623 --> 01:39:11,750
Thankfully. Really.
To hear people saying...

1108
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:13,918
that people go in and out
of here...

1109
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:15,791
without me knowing it, it's
offensive for a doorkeeper.

1110
01:39:23,103 --> 01:39:25,435
- I'm afraid.
- Me too.

1111
01:39:27,173 --> 01:39:33,442
We must go now.
Here, get dressed!

1112
01:39:34,281 --> 01:39:39,275
The doctors forbid me to move.
Where would we go, anyway?

1113
01:39:41,421 --> 01:39:42,410
To my place.

1114
01:39:43,623 --> 01:39:46,820
In Niort? Don't you think
he might be there as well?

1115
01:39:47,394 --> 01:39:49,419
He's more certainly there,
than anywhere else.

1116
01:39:49,996 --> 01:39:52,487
So, we'll travel, we'll go
anywhere.

1117
01:39:53,066 --> 01:39:56,126
It's not possible.
There's no point.

1118
01:39:56,770 --> 01:39:59,864
- I can't stay here anymore.
- So, just go.

1119
01:40:00,974 --> 01:40:03,442
What about you?
I can't leave you here.

1120
01:40:03,476 --> 01:40:07,378
Yes. You'll see. And you'll
get used to managing without me.

1121
01:40:07,447 --> 01:40:10,473
Besides, I don't want to see
you anymore.

1122
01:40:10,517 --> 01:40:13,509
For all that's about to happen...

1123
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:17,148
for all that will eventually
happen...

1124
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:19,249
I'd rather be on my own.

1125
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,494
No, no, please!

1126
01:40:30,003 --> 01:40:33,769
- You hate me, don't you?
- Not at all.

1127
01:40:45,385 --> 01:40:47,717
Where is the little red
suitcase I gave you?

1128
01:40:48,288 --> 01:40:51,314
On the floor, by the closet.

1129
01:40:58,765 --> 01:41:01,928
So you really think it's time
for us to separate?

1130
01:41:01,968 --> 01:41:04,835
Yes, it'll be better that way.

1131
01:41:04,871 --> 01:41:08,238
- I hope you succeed and forget.
- Farewell, Christina.

1132
01:41:20,887 --> 01:41:23,981
"Tremble, she told me,
a girl worthy of me.

1133
01:41:24,024 --> 01:41:27,118
"The cruel God of the Jews is
stronger than you.

1134
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,720
"I pity you for falling
in his fearsome hands."

1135
01:41:59,025 --> 01:42:02,426
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking at you.

1136
01:42:08,701 --> 01:42:12,637
I came to make my report.
That's what I'm paid for.

1137
01:42:13,373 --> 01:42:16,001
But you were sleeping
so deeply...

1138
01:42:16,109 --> 01:42:20,307
Leave me alone.
I'm sick, very sick.

1139
01:42:20,346 --> 01:42:23,179
You'll feel better very soon.

1140
01:42:24,784 --> 01:42:25,978
Everything is fine.

1141
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:30,786
Can't you have some pity for me
and let me die alone?

1142
01:42:30,824 --> 01:42:32,689
Do you think I'm not dying
fast enough?

1143
01:42:32,725 --> 01:42:34,659
What's the matter with you?

1144
01:42:34,694 --> 01:42:37,288
It's not the time to die.

1145
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:41,528
I found him. He'll be here
very shortly.

1146
01:42:41,568 --> 01:42:43,968
It's wrong, and you know it.

1147
01:42:44,037 --> 01:42:45,527
You know he can't come back.

1148
01:42:45,638 --> 01:42:47,538
- Why?
- Because I killed him.

1149
01:42:50,009 --> 01:42:53,638
- This afternoon?
- Five days ago.

1150
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:58,140
Five... So we mustn't be
talking about the same one.

1151
01:42:58,184 --> 01:43:01,813
- Five days ago in Niort.
- And you went to the morgue?

1152
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,322
- His body disappeared.
- From Niort?

1153
01:43:04,357 --> 01:43:08,088
No, from here! We brought him
back in the truck...

1154
01:43:08,128 --> 01:43:10,323
in a wicker trunk.

1155
01:43:10,396 --> 01:43:12,956
When we got here, we threw him
in the swimming pool.

1156
01:43:16,769 --> 01:43:19,294
But you weren't alone in Niort.

1157
01:43:19,339 --> 01:43:21,671
- You were with mademoiselle...
- Horner.

1158
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:26,008
Horner, yes. And didn't she
notice anything?

1159
01:43:26,045 --> 01:43:32,416
She was his mistress.
She helped me. - I see.

1160
01:43:33,753 --> 01:43:35,152
She was his mistress...

1161
01:43:35,188 --> 01:43:38,680
and she helped you. Well...

1162
01:43:44,164 --> 01:43:47,031
I wouldn't mind listening
to what she's got to say.

1163
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,799
- She got scared, and she left.
- It was obvious...

1164
01:43:57,744 --> 01:44:00,440
It won't work. It's Michel's.

1165
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,142
It was under water
a whole day.

1166
01:44:09,856 --> 01:44:11,016
Well, well...

1167
01:44:15,562 --> 01:44:16,893
Aren't you arresting me?

1168
01:44:19,432 --> 01:44:23,198
You should stop playing
with your nerves.

1169
01:44:24,804 --> 01:44:27,102
You need a strong sedative.

1170
01:44:28,975 --> 01:44:30,237
Goodnight.

1171
01:44:33,913 --> 01:44:35,505
Shall I turn off the light?

1172
01:44:39,052 --> 01:44:41,543
Tomorrow morning, you'll
wake up acquitted.

1173
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:51,121
He disappeared. She's deficient.

1174
01:44:51,164 --> 01:44:53,462
In addition, Nicole
runs away.

1175
01:44:53,499 --> 01:44:55,967
- Doesn't it remind you of anything?
- Registering for unemployment.

1176
01:44:56,002 --> 01:44:58,835
I'm afraid. Here's the cop.

1177
01:44:59,305 --> 01:45:01,773
I found it under
the diving board.

1178
01:45:07,247 --> 01:45:10,512
- Isn't there a wicker trunk
around here? - Yes, sir.

1179
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:17,114
- Above the garage.
- So, let's go.

1180
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:23,795
It's starting to stink.

1181
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:27,789
You wonder if anything happened
to Delassalle.

1182
01:45:27,834 --> 01:45:29,597
You're a witness that I didn't
know anything.

1183
01:45:29,636 --> 01:45:31,900
Me either, dear colleague.

1184
01:45:31,938 --> 01:45:33,166
Right. Let him manage alone.

1185
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,761
I don't know why, but...

1186
01:46:02,835 --> 01:46:05,565
You think that we fucked up.
Me too.

1187
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:31,221
M. Pacard. Moinet.

1188
01:46:36,736 --> 01:46:38,931
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight.

1189
01:48:56,075 --> 01:48:56,973
Who's there?

1190
01:53:55,674 --> 01:53:56,902
It's over, this time.

1191
01:54:01,213 --> 01:54:02,339
She's was tough.

1192
01:54:03,649 --> 01:54:07,244
The bitch. She used to say that
she had a heart condition.

1193
01:54:08,154 --> 01:54:09,849
My poor darling.
You're all wet.

1194
01:54:09,889 --> 01:54:10,981
Go change your clothes.

1195
01:54:12,124 --> 01:54:14,615
In the bathroom, it took me...

1196
01:54:14,693 --> 01:54:17,560
more than one hour to get out
of the tub without making noise.

1197
01:54:17,596 --> 01:54:20,963
You must've suffered during
the trip in the trunk.

1198
01:54:25,771 --> 01:54:28,171
What about the dive in the pool
in the middle of the night?

1199
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:31,573
She made life terrible for us.

1200
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:33,134
I got scared more than four times.

1201
01:54:33,245 --> 01:54:34,940
Wasn't it worth it?

1202
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:36,914
Now, we're rich.

1203
01:54:36,949 --> 01:54:38,974
Just by selling the school,
we'll get a lot...

1204
01:54:39,018 --> 01:54:42,215
Between 15 and 20
years in jail.

1205
01:54:42,254 --> 01:54:44,279
It'll depend on the judge.

1206
01:54:54,166 --> 01:54:56,566
Moinet, Moinet.

1207
01:54:57,603 --> 01:54:58,934
Wait a moment.

1208
01:55:03,209 --> 01:55:06,508
You again, Moinet. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

1209
01:55:07,413 --> 01:55:10,280
On the day
we're closing the school.

1210
01:55:10,316 --> 01:55:14,013
- Who gave you this slingshot?
- Mme. Delassalle.

1211
01:55:14,053 --> 01:55:17,648
- Who? - Mme. Delassalle.
She opened her door.

1212
01:55:17,690 --> 01:55:19,624
She gave me back my slingshot.

1213
01:55:19,658 --> 01:55:22,650
She said: "This is for you,
Moinet. Have fun."

1214
01:55:22,695 --> 01:55:28,759
You are impossible.
You know that she's dead.

1215
01:55:28,801 --> 01:55:32,931
- Her body was taken away today.
- She's not dead. She came back.

1216
01:55:32,972 --> 01:55:35,964
M. Moinet, go to
the corner.

1217
01:55:40,713 --> 01:55:43,341
I saw her.
I know that I saw her.

1218
01:55:57,830 --> 01:56:00,458
Don't be devils. Don't ruin...

1219
01:56:00,532 --> 01:56:04,161
the interest your friends
could take in this film.

1220
01:56:04,203 --> 01:56:07,468
Don't tell them
what you saw.

1221
01:56:07,506 --> 01:56:10,373
Thank you for them.

1222
01:56:11,506 --> 01:56:14,373
