1
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,540
Soon after its premiere,
the film Metropolis

2
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,749
was severely truncated
and alterations were made.

3
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,915
From that time onward,
more than a quarter of the film

4
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,124
was assumed to have been lost.

5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,332
Then, in 2008, a virtually complete
version of the film

6
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,540
was discovered in Buenos Aires.
What had been preserved

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,749
was, however, a heavily damaged
copy of the film

8
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,915
that had been printed to 16mm
film stock,

9
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:47,207
lacking the full frame
of the picture's original aspect ratio.

10
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:51,707
A considerable amount of the film
reconstruction was able to be completed

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,207
and the correct sequence
of its editing

12
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,124
established by means
of this Argentinian material.

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,249
Spanish intertitles have been translated
into German

14
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,374
with the aid of the censor-cards.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,415
In order to display in their correct
position on the image

16
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,332
the cropped elements taken
from the 16mm negative,

17
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,290
the missing portion of the frame
has been marked by black.

18
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,832
The intertitles appear
with their original graphic treatment.

19
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:20,790
Those titles which appear in a different
typeface (like the one used here)

20
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:24,374
have been added to summarise
the content of still-missing scenes

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,332
as far as is necessary
to facilitate

22
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,707
an adequate understanding
of the storyline.

23
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,957
Shorter gaps are indicated
by small segments of black leader.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,290

THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,290
Shift change.

45
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,332
Deep beneath

46
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,999
the earth lay the

47
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:30,207
City of the Workers.

48
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:45,499
As deep beneath the earth
as the City of the Workers lay,

49
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:51,249
so high above it towered the complex
known as the "Sons' Club",

50
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:56,957
with its lecture halls and libraries,
its theatres and stadiums.

51
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:34,374
Fathers, for whom every revolution
of a mechanical wheel meant gold,

52
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,249
had bestowed upon their sons
the wonder of the Eternal Gardens.

53
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:02,165
Which of you ladies shall today

54
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:07,124
have the honour of entertaining Master Freder,
Joh Fredersen's son?

55
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,415
Look! These are your brothers!

56
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,832
Look - !

57
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,374
These are your brothers!

58
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,165
Who - was that?

59
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,749
But this was what happened to Freder -

60
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,332
the son of Joh Fredersen,
the master of Metropolis -

61
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,124
as he sought out the girl:

62
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,957
To the new Tower of Babel -
to my father - !

63
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:43,499
Why is it, Josaphat, that I learn of this explosion
from my son, and not from you - !

64
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,749
Details - !

65
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:12,457
What were you looking for
in the Machine-Halls, Freder?

66
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:21,790
I wanted to look into the faces of the people
whose little children are my brothers, my sisters...

67
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,832
Your magnificent city, Father -

68
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:55,124
and you the brain of this city -
and all of us within the light of this city... -

69
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:26,540
...and where are the people, Father,
whose hands built your city - ?

70
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:36,540
Off where they belong...

71
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,374
...off where they belong...?

72
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:54,957
...in the Depths...?

73
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:35,249
And if those in the Depths
one day rise against you?

74
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,207
The chief foreman of the Heart-Machine, Grot, -
with an important message...

75
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:38,124
There were two more copies
of those damnable plans, Herr Fredersen...

76
00:27:19,125 --> 00:27:24,082
...in the pockets of two men who met
with an accident today at the M-Machine...

77
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:44,832
How is it, Josaphat, that these plans
were brought to me by Grot, rather than by you?

78
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:14,124
Apply to the G-Bank
for your remaining wages...

79
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:23,165
Father, do you know what it means
to be dismissed by you? -

80
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:27,415
It means: To be sent below! -
Father - below! Into the Depths - !

81
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:46,749
Do you know what it means to be dismissed
like that by Joh Fredersen?

82
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:09,290
Would you like to come with me,
Josaphat?

83
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:58,124
Go home, Josaphat, and wait for me...
I still have a long way to go tonight...

84
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:14,374
Into the Depths, -
to my brothers...

85
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:29,374
From today on I wish to be kept precisely informed
of my son's every move...

86
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,790
Brother...

87
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:02,165
...the Machine! There needs
to be someone at the Machine!

88
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:12,624
There will be someone at the machine...

89
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,707
ME.

90
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:31,415
Listen to me...
I want to trade my life with you...

91
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:08,124
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

92
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:17,707
Wait for me -
both of you...

93
00:35:48,541 --> 00:36:08,957
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

94
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,874
In the middle of Metropolis,

95
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,499
there stands a strange house
that the centuries had overlooked.

96
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:20,415
The man who dwelled within
was Rotwang, the inventor.

97
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:40,915
Hel

98
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:45,499
Born to bring me happiness
and a benediction to all mankind.

99
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:50,124
Lost to Joh Fredersen.
Died giving life to Freder, Joh Fredersen's son.

100
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:21,040
A mind like yours, Rotwang,
should be able to forget...

101
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:32,707
Only one time in life did I forget something:
that Hel was a woman - and you a man...

102
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:43,665
Let the dead lie, Rotwang...
She's dead for you as she is for me...

103
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:56,332
For me she isn't dead, Joh Fredersen -
for me she lives - !

104
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:14,374
Do you think the loss of a hand
is too high a price for recreating Hel - ?!

105
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:24,249
Do you wish to see her - ?!

106
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:28,832
Now, Joh Fredersen - ?!

107
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:32,915
Isn't it worth losing a hand
to have created the man of the future -

108
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,124
the Machine-Man - ?!

109
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:46,540
24 more hours of work -

110
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:51,832
and no man, Joh Fredersen, will be able
to differentiate the Machine-Man from a mortal - !

111
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:17,374
The woman is mine, Joh Fredersen!
Hel's son was yours!

112
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:49,499
And what brings you my way,
Joh Fredersen?

113
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:06,832
I need your advice -
as usual, when all my experts fail me...

114
00:45:20,166 --> 00:45:23,082
Can you decipher for me these plans

115
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:28,457
that for months have been getting discovered
in the pockets of my workers?

116
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:08,832
...at two... once my shift ends!
She has summoned us again...

117
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:41,915
Father - ! Father - !
Will ten hours never come to an end - ??! !

118
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,540
- it's a blueprint
of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs

119
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:20,790
deep below the lowest levels
of your Metropolis...

120
00:48:56,041 --> 00:49:04,207
I should like to glean what my workers
are doing exactly in those catacombs...

121
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,624
Today I shall tell you

122
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,915
the legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL...

123
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:40,707
The Legend of THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THE TOWER OF BABEL

124
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:56,915
Come! Let us build a tower
whose zenith shall reach unto the stars!

125
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:03,749
And at the tower's zenith we shall write:

126
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:08,457
Great is the world and its Maker!
And great is Man!

127
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:31,665
...but those who had conceived
of the Tower of Babel

128
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,082
could not build the Tower of Babel.

129
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:38,874
The task was too great.
So they paid wages to outside hands...

130
00:53:56,166 --> 00:54:01,249
But the hands that built the Tower of Babel
knew nothing of the dream

131
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:06,540
of which the head that had conceived it
had been fantasising.

132
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:39,374
The hymns of praise of one man
became the curses of others.

133
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:58,832
The same language was spoken,
but these men did not understand one another...

134
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:14,499
Great is the world and its Maker
and great is Man

135
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:34,290
HEAD and HANDS require a Mediator.

136
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:42,957
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!

137
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:16,999
And where is our Mediator,
Maria - ?

138
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:42,207
Wait for him!
He will surely come!

139
00:56:57,583 --> 00:57:02,540
We will wait, Maria...!
But not for much longer - !

140
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,457
Oh Mediator,
have you finally come...

141
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:04,207
You summoned me -
here I am!

142
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:41,665
Rotwang, give the Machine-Man
the likeness of this woman...

143
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:54,832
I shall sow discord
between them and her!

144
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:59,082
I shall destroy their belief
in this woman -

145
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:32,999
Leave me alone now, Joh Fredersen...
You'll find the way back without me...

146
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:03,624
You fool! Now you shall also lose
the last remaining thing you still had from Hel...

147
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:07,249
your son...

148
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:34,332
Until tomorrow, in the cathedral!

149
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:10,290
END OF THE PRELUDE

150
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:18,624
INTERMEZZO

151
01:06:56,208 --> 01:07:00,040
Freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit
who preaches:

152
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:05,040
"Verily, I say unto you: the days
of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh!"

153
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:09,457
The monk's hand points to the Bible,
in which it is written:

154
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:13,415
"And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured
beast, full of names of blasphemy,

155
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,707
having seven heads and ten horns.

156
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:19,499
And the woman was arrayed
in purple and scarlet colour,

157
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:21,790
having a golden cup in her hand.

158
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:25,582
And upon her forehead was a name
written, a mystery:

159
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:29,207
BABYLON THE GREAT, the Mother
of Abominations ofthe Earth.

160
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:32,665
And I saw the woman drunken
with the blood ofthe Saints."

161
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:54,332
You will annihilate Joh Fredersen -
him and his city and his son - !

162
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:41,124
GLUTTONY

163
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:42,957
AVARICE

SLOTH

169
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:10,499
Had you come earlier,
you wouldn't have frightened me...

170
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:14,749
I now beg of you: stay away from me
and my beloved...!

171
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:24,082
Where is the one whose clothes
you are wearing?

172
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:44,040
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

173
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,415
Would you please wake Georgy up?

174
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:25,415
He must lead me
to the Workers' City at once...

175
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:52,124
No. 11811, get back to the Machine
and forget that you ever left it - understood?

176
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,790
I have to have someone
who's faithful to me, Josaphat, -

177
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:20,749
otherwise, how shall I attain the end-goal
of my path - ?!

178
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:51,124
I must go on, Josaphat, -
must now, on my own,

179
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:55,040
seek out the person to whom Georgy
was supposed to lead me...

180
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:03,624
Tonight, Josaphat -
tonight when I come back...

181
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:56,624
Josaphat.
99th Block. House 7, 7th Floor.

182
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:41,707
So, what price are you demanding
for leaving this residence tonight?

183
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:33,040
You still don't seem to have grasped
who sent me here...

184
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,749
CENTRAL BANK OF METROPOLIS

185
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:45,874
This man doesn't want his son
to find you still here tonight!

186
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:43,707
In three hours' time
I shall be calling for you!

187
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:46,332
Come! It is time to give the Man-Machine
your face!

188
01:26:30,916 --> 01:26:34,999
Where is Maria - ?!

189
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:48,290
She's with your father...

190
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:10,040
I'm telling you,
she is with your father - !

191
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:15,790
"She is the most perfect and most obedient tool
that a man has ever possessed!

192
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:19,915
Tonight you shall see how she holds up
before the eyes ofthe upper hundred.

193
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:24,165
You shall see her dance, and if only one single
person recognises the machine in her,

194
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:28,290
I will call myself a bungler
who never succeeded at anything!

195
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:31,457
C. Rotwang"

196
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:36,374
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen
to be his guest this evening."

197
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:15,624
I want you to go to those in the Depths
in order to annihilate the work of your prototype!

198
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,290
"C. A. Rotwang requests Herr Joh Fredersen
to be his guest this evening."

199
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:11,290
Verily, I say unto you: the days
of which the Apocalypse speaks draw nigh...!

200
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:27,040
All Seven Deadly Sins,
on her behalf - !

201
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:17,707
Death overtakes the City - !

202
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:34,499
END OF THE INTERMEZZO

203
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:57,957
The Revelation of St. John
Avalun Publishing, Hellerau

204
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:20,499
I escaped from the Thin Man
wearing this attire...

205
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:25,165
But for ten days your father's bloodhound
has been making the Workers' City unsafe...

206
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,082
The only thing keeping the workers in check

207
01:35:38,208 --> 01:35:42,415
is their expectation for the Mediator
promised unto them...

208
01:36:07,416 --> 01:36:12,707
Even stranger things
have been happening, Freder...

209
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:27,790
On that evening when you fell ill...

210
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:43,415
...once the best of friends...
because of that woman...

211
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:54,040
...the other man...
on that same evening...

212
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:08,624
...the Eternal Gardens lie abandoned...
but night after night in Yoshiwara...

213
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:51,082
And this woman,
at whose feet all sins are heaped...

214
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:56,124
...is also called Maria...

215
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:10,999
That same woman that those in the Depths
regard as a saint - ?!

216
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:28,832
Many now go to the City of the Dead,

217
01:38:28,958 --> 01:38:33,790
to a woman they have judged
to be as true as gold.

218
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:43,999
The Mediator is not likely
to miss that occasion...

219
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:10,165
Whatever happens tonight:

220
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:14,415
it is my express order to allow the workers
to do as they please...

221
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:30,707
Joh Fredersen wants to let those in the Depths
use force and do wrong

222
01:39:30,833 --> 01:39:36,165
so that he can claim the right
to use force against them...

223
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:58,999
When you spoke to your poor brothers,
you talked about peace, Maria...

224
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:04,499
today a mouthpiece of Joh Fredersen
incites them to rebel against him...

225
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:32,832
She will destroy their belief
in the Mediator!

226
01:41:11,125 --> 01:41:17,707
You know I've always talked about peace...
but your Mediator hasn't come...

227
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:34,582
You've waited long enough!
Your time has come - !

228
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:45,040
...but I've tricked Joh Fredersen!

229
01:41:45,166 --> 01:41:49,540
Your clone does not obey his will -
only mine alone!

230
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:05,249
Who is the living fodder
for the machines for Metropolis - ?!

231
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:16,415
Who smears the machine-joints
with their own marrow - ?!

232
01:42:31,333 --> 01:42:36,249
Who feeds the machines
with their own flesh - ?!

233
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:49,624
Let the machines starve, you fools - !
Finish them off - ! !

234
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:57,874
Do them in -
these machines - ! !

235
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:17,082
You aren't Maria - ! ! !

236
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:23,040
YOU ARE NOT MARIA - !

237
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:42,499
Maria talks of peace, not murder - !
This is not Maria - ! !

238
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:51,332
Joh Fredersen's son - ! !

239
01:43:53,833 --> 01:44:00,415
Do him in, the dog,
in his white silken hide - ! ! !

240
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:35,540
Get your women, your sons,
out of the Workers' City!

241
01:44:35,666 --> 01:44:39,749
Let no-one stay behind!
Death to the machines - ! ! !

242
01:44:50,291 --> 01:44:52,457
In the attic of his home,

243
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:56,165
Rotwang displays
for Maria his ever-growing intoxication

244
01:44:56,291 --> 01:44:58,374
with his triumph over Fredersen:

245
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:00,874
" - and twice over did I trick Joh Fredersen - !

246
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,915
For I concealed from him that his son
wants to be the Mediator of your brothers -

247
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:06,915
and is in love with you - !"

248
01:45:07,208 --> 01:45:09,707
Maria isn't the only one listening to Rotwang.

249
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:13,832
On the other side of the attic's window,
Joh Fredersen was eavesdropping...

250
01:45:14,291 --> 01:45:19,124
Joh Fredersen breaks into Rotwang's attic.
He wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him.

251
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:22,582
Maria is free.

252
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,082
...faithful after all...

253
01:46:12,125 --> 01:46:15,332
Come, Freder!
We still have to go through the Workers' City.

254
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,665
Women and men,
let no-one miss out on today - !

255
01:46:52,791 --> 01:46:54,915
Death to the machines - ! !

256
01:49:03,708 --> 01:49:08,624
Not one man -
not one woman has stayed behind - !

257
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:56,540
Leave the machines - !
Let them race to their death - !

258
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:07,874
To the Heart-Machine - !

259
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:20,957
DANGER

260
01:51:42,333 --> 01:51:44,624
Open the gates!

261
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:55,624
You have to open the gates!

262
01:51:58,166 --> 01:52:00,874
If the Heart-Machine perishes,

263
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,749
nothing in the Machine-District
will be left standing - ! !

264
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:56,415
Have you lost your minds - ??

265
01:52:56,541 --> 01:53:01,999
If the Heart-Machine perishes,
the entire Workers' City will be laid to waste - ! !

266
01:58:52,583 --> 01:58:57,165
Where are your fathers,
your mothers?

267
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:54,665
Do you have any idea that your son
is amongst the workers?!

268
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:37,415
Yes - you! You're Maria - !

269
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:54,832
To the air shafts - quickly! Quickly!
The reservoirs have burst! The city is drowning - !

270
02:06:29,791 --> 02:06:34,707
We'll take the children
to the Sons' Club!

271
02:06:46,083 --> 02:06:51,040
Why are all the lights out?

272
02:07:13,875 --> 02:07:18,790
I need to know - !
Where is my son?! ! !

273
02:07:21,958 --> 02:07:25,665
Tomorrow thousands
will ask in fury and desperation:

274
02:07:25,791 --> 02:07:28,540
Joh Fredersen,
where is my son - ?!

275
02:08:13,375 --> 02:08:17,457
Where are your children??!

276
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,582
The city is drowned,
the shafts are totally flooded - ! !

277
02:08:39,416 --> 02:08:48,499
Who bade you attack the machines,
without which you're finished, you idiots - ??!

278
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:58,332
It's the witch's fault - !

279
02:09:08,375 --> 02:09:12,707
We'll be looking on
as the world goes to the devil - !

280
02:09:53,875 --> 02:10:00,457
Find the witch; this is all her fault - !
Strike her dead - ! !

281
02:11:14,833 --> 02:11:19,749
Now I'm going to take you home,
my Hel - !

282
02:12:33,125 --> 02:12:39,707
The witch - ! the witch - !
There she is - ! there she is - !

283
02:12:42,916 --> 02:12:49,499
Where are our children,
you witch, you - ??!

284
02:12:55,083 --> 02:13:01,665
Burn the witch. -
To the stake with her! ! !

285
02:14:55,875 --> 02:14:59,124
To the stake with her - ! !

286
02:17:24,958 --> 02:17:29,915
Hel - ! My Hel - ! !

287
02:21:18,416 --> 02:21:23,332
Your children... saved - ! ! !

288
02:25:25,708 --> 02:25:30,749
Head and hands want to join together,
but they don't have the heart to do it...

289
02:25:30,916 --> 02:25:34,790
Oh Mediator,
show them the way to one another...

290
02:26:14,541 --> 02:26:23,624
THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS
MUST BE THE HEART!
