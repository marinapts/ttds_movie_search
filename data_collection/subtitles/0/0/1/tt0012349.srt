00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,489
His morning promenade.

8
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,053
"Awkward ass."

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,286
"Pardon me, you dropped something."

10
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:05,295
"Is that yours?"

11
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,824
"What its name?"

"Remember - if he smites you
on one cheek,...

28
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:03,880

00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:13,018
"Well - pràctically."

38
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:17,815
"Explain yourself."

"Ask him where the kid is."

45
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:44,545
"Ask him if he's got any belongings."

46
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:50,259
" Tell him it's none of his business."

47
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,195
Night.

48
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:35,956

Shopping.

53
00:48:34,189 --> 00:48:36,275
Off for a spin.

54
00:48:45,868 --> 00:48:47,661
Sin creeps in.

55
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:51,957
