1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:06,671
After the conquest and plundering
of the Inca empire by Spain...

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:10,231
...the Indians invented the
legend of El Dorado...

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:14,746
...a land of gold, located in the
swamps of the Amazon headwaters.

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,352
A large expedition of Spanish
adventurers, led by Gonzalo Pizarro...

5
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,356
...set off from the Peruvian
highlands in late 1560.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,219
The only document to survive
from this lost expedition...

7
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,391
...is the diary of the monk
Gaspar de Carvajal.

8
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:56,922
<i>On Christmas day 1560, we reached
the last pass of the Andes...

9
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:01,093
<i>...and for the first time looked
down at the legendary jungle.

10
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:07,432
<i>In the morning I read mass, then we
descended through the clouds.

11
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:21,700
AGUIRRE,
THE WRATH OF GOD

12
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:27,301
A film by
Werner Herzog

13
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,514
No one can get down that river alive!

14
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,246
I tell you, we can do it!

15
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,097
From here it will be easier.

16
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,804
No. We're all going to go under.

17
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,257
<i>Our Indian slaves are useless.

18
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,463
<i>The changing climate
kills them off like flies...

19
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,160
<i>...most of them die of colds.

20
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,966
<i>We don't even have time to
give them a Christian burial.

21
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,463
Come on, move it!

22
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,170
Move you pigs!
Come on! Let's go!

23
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,210
Keep moving, we don't want
to get stuck in the mud!

24
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,853
Son of a bitch!

25
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,099
You idiots!
The sedan-chair will get stuck!

26
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,597
This way!

27
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,800
Damned mud!

28
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,792
Watch it, you idiots!

29
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,211
Keep the barrel out of the water!

30
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,261
<i>By the last day of the year,
we were exhausted.

31
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,274
<i>We camped near the river.

32
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,440
It can't go on like this, men.

33
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,754
The rations are almost finished.

34
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:56,290
The terrain is so difficult,
we're almost at a standstill.

35
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:04,659
We cannot hope to reach a
populated area for some time.

36
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,070
In view of the situation we're in...

37
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,972
...I have changed my plans...

38
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,140
...as follows:

39
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:23,750
Rafts will be built
and manned by forty men.

40
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,326
These men will have the task...

41
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:35,665
...to get food and information
about hostile Indians...

42
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,737
...and the location of El Dorado.

43
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,807
We have every reason to
believe that both are near...

44
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,706
The expedition must return
within one week...

45
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,085
...by water or by land.

46
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,788
If it doesn't...

47
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,885
...we have to assume it is lost...

48
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,954
...and we have to march back
the same way...

49
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:12,504
...in the hope of reaching an area
inhabited by Christians.

50
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:17,765
We hope, of course,
that this will not happen...

51
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,313
...as long as the Virgin Mary
is with us.

52
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,644
After careful consideration,
I have decided...

53
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:32,952
...to make Don Pedro de Ursua
commander of the expedition.

54
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:38,695
His mistress, Dona Inez de Atienza,
will accompany him.

55
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,965
This happens against my
better judgement.

56
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:48,098
But she expressed her wish with
such grace and firmness...

57
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,898
...that I cannot refuse it.

58
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,311
Don Lope de Aguirre will be
second in command.

59
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:59,180
A man who is well qualified
for this task.

60
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,809
His daughter Flores will stay
under his protection...

61
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,380
...this also is against
my better judgement.

62
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:12,395
At fifteen, she should have stayed
in the care of the Holy Sisters.

63
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:18,533
As on all expeditions, the word of
God must be brought to the pagans.

64
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:24,074
I hereby nominate Brother
Gaspar de Carvajal for this task.

65
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:31,343
The remaining two hundred slaves
will stay with my group.

66
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:38,289
The Royal House of Spain
will be represented...

67
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,689
...by the brave nobleman,
Don Fernando de Guzman...

68
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,092
...who proved his courage
10 years ago...

69
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:48,360
...at the storming of the fortress
of Saxahuaman.

70
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,035
Some of the best warriors will
form this group...

71
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:58,167
...but those not chosen
shouldn't feel rejected.

72
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:02,211
I declare all this in the
form of a document...

73
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:07,112
...to be submitted for approval
to the Council of the Indies.

74
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,254
Herewith I append my signature.

75
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:27,104
<i>Four days later, on January fourth,
we set out.

76
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,169
<i>May God be with us.

77
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,966
Watch the raft,
the rapids get stronger!

78
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,215
Keep in the middle of the river!

79
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:37,325
- The first raft got stuck in an eddy!
- They must get away from the rocks!

80
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,101
<i>January Sixth.

81
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,741
<i>We finally reached shore
and set up camp.

82
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:32,075
<i>On the other side of the river,
one of our rafts ran into an eddy.

83
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:37,615
<i>We could not hear what they
were yelling, and could not help.

84
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,994
How many are on the raft?

85
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,064
Seven and two Indians.

86
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,430
We must try to help
the poor devils, Aguirre.

87
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,568
You are crazy!

88
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,874
We will not help them!

89
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,174
I'm still giving the orders.

90
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,473
Is that so...

91
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:20,557
We need long ropes and hooks.
Further downstream we can cross.

92
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,395
Once we're on the other side,
we'll be able to get them out.

93
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,305
Take as many men as
you need... and hurry!

94
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,350
I wonder if Armando has
reached the other side?

95
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:24,388
Those men must be getting sick.
They're still going around in circles.

96
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,259
- What is this?
- They're firing over there.

97
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,435
They're trying to signal us.

98
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,137
Maybe it's a battle?

99
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,972
There are only six.

100
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,305
The oarsmen and the
seventh man have gone.

101
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,105
I find that strange.

102
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,345
Look, the oars are still there.

103
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,691
I'm sure, there are still
some Indians in this area.

104
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,227
We better go back to the camp.

105
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,694
Keep your eyes open!

106
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,121
Help!

107
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,286
Indians! Indians!

108
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,561
A prayer from here is not enough,
Brother Carvajal.

109
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,970
I want to take these men
back for a Christian burial.

110
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,273
You are right, my son...

111
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,203
...their souls will rest much better
in consecrated ground.

112
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:06,808
It's the least we can do for these
poor guys who died so bravely.

113
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,398
Perucho!

114
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,313
Perucho, don't you think the
cannon is getting a bit rusty?

115
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,147
Perhaps.

116
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,317
You know very well
who is responsible.

117
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:56,286
If Aguirre gets away with this,
who knows what he'll do next?

118
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,884
Don't worry about that.

119
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,756
We really have other problems.

120
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,623
There are Indians everywhere.

121
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,736
The whole area is full of them...

122
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,569
...and no one wants to die
like the men on the raft.

123
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,576
If only we were out of this trouble...

124
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:17,413
We can't hope for that yet.

125
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,780
Don't be afraid.

126
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:25,145
Aguirre would never dare to rebel
against the Spanish crown.

127
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,755
We are not in Castile, here.

128
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,126
Look what I've found for you.

129
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,236
This animal sleeps its
whole life away.

130
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,037
It's never really awake.

131
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,728
Our rafts are gone.

132
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,039
The rafts are gone!

133
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,940
<i>January Eighth.

134
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,448
<i>The river rose fifteen feet
over night.

135
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,480
<i>When will our misfortunes end?

136
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,130
If I remove your chains,
will you run away?

137
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,965
Would you?

138
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,099
Stop, wait a minute, isn't that my pot?

139
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,134
What are you doing with my pot?

140
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,150
No, the wood is too heavy.

141
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:39,184
We'll take this one. I'm not taking
one step further into this jungle.

142
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,128
What's going on?

143
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,624
We're making nails.

144
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,203
What for?

145
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,067
We need as many nails as possible.

146
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,669
What are you doing with this log?

147
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,342
Well, I'm carrying it from where
I found it back to the camp.

148
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,180
Who gave that order?

149
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,816
Everyone here is collecting wood.

150
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,691
And iron.

151
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,977
What's going on here?

152
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,705
I have no idea.

153
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,809
Who gave the order to build rafts?

154
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,074
What does it all mean?
Do you know, Inez?

155
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,811
Don't even ask.
It's your father's fault.

156
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,077
If only it were all over.

157
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:21,590
Gentlemen, as your commander,
I have decided...

158
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,920
...to return to our main troop.

159
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,656
It's not my habit to retreat.

160
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:30,667
We have to march back, of course,
because the current is too strong.

161
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:35,501
We need to get back within the
time Pizarro ordered.

162
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,406
But that would be suicide
because of the Indians.

163
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:43,306
Whatever the cost,
we have to march back.

164
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,939
We must get back to Pizarro!

165
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,914
Shit on Pizarro!

166
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,853
I say, we can't accomplish
our task this way.

167
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,619
And I say, we can conquer
without Pizarro!

168
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,359
That's what we gathered
logs and iron for...

169
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,656
...to build a raft.

170
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,262
Do you remember Hernando Cortez?

171
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,699
Bound for Mexico, he was ordered
to return...

172
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,774
...but he just went on!

173
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,145
Silence, Aguirre!

174
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:28,425
He ignored the orders
and conquered Mexico!

175
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,084
Silence, everyone!

176
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,762
That's how he became
rich and famous...

177
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:34,991
Be quiet!

178
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,856
Because he disobeyed!

179
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,329
Put him in chains!

180
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,248
Stop it, now!

181
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,654
- I follow Ursua.
- Kill him!

182
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,551
Anyone else?

183
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,161
What do you think will happen now?

184
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,193
What if there are
waterfalls downstream?

185
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,570
Who cares, as long as we
get closer to El Dorado.

186
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,847
Have you seen Ursua
clenching his fist?

187
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,282
He must have something in it.

188
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,916
I think, they will kill him.

189
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,426
Would you have the courage
to help him?

190
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,306
You're the only one who can help us.

191
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,667
I know he will kill Ursua
and Armando.

192
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:11,848
He will finish what he has started.

193
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,315
You are my last hope.

194
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:23,919
Thou lettest man flow on like a river...

195
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,622
...and Thy years know no end.

196
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,764
As for man...

197
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,897
...his days are like grass...

198
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,872
...as a flower on the field,
so he blossoms.

199
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,909
For when the wind passeth over it...

200
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:44,539
...and it is gone, and the place
thereof shall know it no more.

201
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,778
You know, my child...

202
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,455
...for the good of our Lord...

203
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:57,587
...the Church was always
on the side of the strong.

204
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,338
I would like to have you on our side.

205
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,848
We need men like you.

206
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,963
You should think about it...

207
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,108
...but not too long.

208
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,748
Well, gentlemen...

209
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,247
...we've gotten rid of
the troublemakers.

210
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,256
Now we need a leader.

211
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,418
For me, the choice is clear.

212
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:08,464
We should elect the biggest
and strongest nobleman we have.

213
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,592
- What me?
- Yes... you.

214
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,063
Well, gentlemen.

215
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,939
I am making a proposal
to elect Guzmn.

216
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,241
Who else is for him?

217
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:06,946
I propose that Don Lope de Aguirre
remains second-in-command!

218
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,582
Who's in favor?

219
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:30,579
Plagues have come over my
people, earthquakes and floods...

220
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,740
...but what the Spaniards did to us...

221
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,181
...is much, much worse.

222
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:40,087
They gave me the name Balthasar,
but my real name is Runo Rimac.

223
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,092
- What does that mean?
- Runo Rimac.

224
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,857
It means: He who speaks.
I was a prince in this land.

225
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:51,264
No one was allowed to look
directly into my eyes.

226
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,167
But now I'm in chains,
like my people...

227
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,830
...and I must bow my head.

228
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:03,078
Almost everything was taken from us.
I can't do anything, I'm powerless.

229
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,872
But I am also sorry for you...

230
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:11,046
...because I know there is
no escape from this jungle.

231
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,131
How is Ursua?

232
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:26,395
Because of our mutiny,
we must make our position legal.

233
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,928
Read this document.

234
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:38,436
Caesarian King, by the grace of God,
through our Holy Mother...

235
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,273
...the Roman Church,
Philip the Second of Castile.

236
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,574
We, the undersigned,
have until yesterday...

237
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,710
...the seventh day of 1561

238
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,755
...regarded ourselves as your
servants and subjects.

239
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:57,954
We are now more than 200 miles
from your servant, Gonzalo Pizarro.

240
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:02,465
Fate, God's help and the work of our
hands have carried us down a river.

241
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,400
A river, the natives call Huallaga,
in search of a new land of gold.

242
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:10,406
We have decided to put
an end to the quirks of fate.

243
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:15,605
We are forging history, and no fruits of
this earth shall henceforth be shared.

244
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,045
We rebel until death.

245
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:27,255
Our hands shall perish and our
tongues dry up if this is not so.

246
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,224
The House of Habsburg
is overthrown.

247
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:34,286
And you, Philip the Second,
are dethroned.

248
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:38,027
By dint of this declaration,
be you annihilated.

249
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,262
In your place we proclaim...

250
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,272
...the nobleman from Sevilla,
Don Fernando de Guzmn...

251
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,673
...as Emperor of El Dorado.

252
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,938
Flee from hence, O King!

253
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,010
And may God bless your soul.

254
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:56,416
Fortune smiles on the brave
and spits on the coward.

255
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,718
Let's sever our ties with Spain and
crown Don Fernando de Guzmn...

256
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,918
...Emperor of El Dorado.

257
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,222
Do you call this a throne?

258
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:10,596
What is a throne, but a plank
covered with velvet, Your Majesty.

259
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,869
He must have
dragged himself along.

260
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:58,840
That's no arrow wound,
that was a sword thrust.

261
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,277
He must have tried to stop him.

262
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,915
<i>January Tenth.

263
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,316
<i>Armando escaped from his prison.

264
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:20,861
<i>The man who went on guard at
three o'clock was murdered.

265
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:46,087
It was one of his men.
While Ursua is alive...

266
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,687
...you'll never be safe!

267
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,850
What can I do about it?

268
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,485
Kill him.

269
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,789
While I'm Emperor, law will prevail.

270
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,726
No killings without a trial.

271
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:03,170
Then try him... and then kill him!

272
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,002
But it must me a public trial.

273
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,072
He still has sympathizers.

274
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,682
Perucho, to the witness stand.

275
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,928
What did you get out of Ursua?

276
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,090
Nothing.

277
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:33,300
Three men couldn't open his fist.
He must have something in it.

278
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,838
We'd have to chop his
hand off to get at it.

279
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,339
He said nothing,
except some nonsense.

280
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,775
But last night he had visitors.

281
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:47,843
The whole story reeks of conspiracy.

282
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:54,619
Balthasar, ask him if it's true that
he received money from Ursua.

283
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,253
Yes, it's true.

284
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,258
It was the oarsmen's pay.

285
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,529
Next witness!

286
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,967
Okello, is it true that you also
received money from Ursua?

287
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:19,947
I was Pizarro's slave. Then he
gave me away for this expedition...

288
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:24,820
...because he thought, if the Indians
are scared of a horse...

289
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,823
...they'd be terrified of a black man.

290
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:34,464
Well, I don't know why, but
sometimes Ursua gave me money.

291
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,561
What does the defendant
have to say?

292
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,957
I want to speak.

293
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:06,424
In Spain I had many servants,
and I paid them.

294
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:12,297
It is only fair to give them
money here as well...

295
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,997
...even if they are Indians.

296
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,937
Time will tell that Ursua is right.

297
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:24,412
We understand your confusion,
my child. You are excused.

298
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:47,564
The jury, after having heard
all testimonies...

299
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,003
...finds the defendant...

300
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,301
...guilty of treason.

301
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,010
My unpleasant duty...

302
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:03,012
...as President of the first court
of your Highness, Don Fernando...

303
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:08,517
...is to sentence Pedro de Ursua...

304
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,822
...to death by hanging.

305
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,230
I confirm the verdict.

306
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,737
But since it is the anniversary of
the last Moor leaving Spain...

307
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,606
...I will grant clemency.

308
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,170
His life will be spared,
but he forfeits...

309
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,611
...all rights as a citizen of El Dorado.

310
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,650
Half of his shares
will go to the Church...

311
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:39,120
...the other half will be divided
among my best soldiers.

312
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,912
<i>January Twelfth.

313
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,517
<i>In the morning we set out
with a new raft.

314
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,114
<i>Ursua is still alive...

315
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,789
<i>...but he refuses to speak.

316
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,621
Look, a fire!

317
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,329
<i>At noon we saw a great fire.

318
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,329
Steer closer to the shore!

319
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:31,467
Load your muskets.

320
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,833
I can't see anyone.

321
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,946
Be careful, men!
It could be an ambush.

322
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,611
Strip the negro, go on!

323
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:56,731
<i>Fearing an ambush, we stripped the
negro slave, to frighten the Indians.

324
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,277
Go! Run!

325
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,317
Go on! Go, I said!

326
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,021
Drive him in front of us!

327
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,370
Get away from the food!

328
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,773
Look out for Indians!

329
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,080
Are you crazy?

330
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,053
Take your weapons!

331
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,454
Look at that. It was one of our men.

332
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,030
Where does this come from?

333
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,836
And this here?

334
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,078
For heaven's sake, cannibals!

335
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:10,828
<i>The discovery of cannibals
around us was so disturbing...

336
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,630
<i>...that we hastily left
this dreadful place.

337
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:33,918
<i>January twentieth.

338
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:37,824
<i>The mountains are now behind us
and the land is flat.

339
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:43,028
<i>The roof Aguirre had us build,
protects us against the scorching sun.

340
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,828
<i>The river is sluggish and we're
slowly coming to a halt.

341
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,961
What's this?
Are you giving him a gun?

342
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:06,411
Aguirre, I know that you plan on
doing something to Ursua!

343
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,709
There's no doubt in my mind.

344
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,351
And God will punish you for that!

345
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,398
Get out of my way!

346
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,607
Are you alright, little one?

347
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,873
What's happening?
You can't hear a thing.

348
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,229
It's suddenly so quiet.

349
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,132
Yes, not a sound.

350
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,636
Shh... so, we can hear...

351
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,120
The gunpowder! It's on fire!

352
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,530
Out of the way! It's going to blow up!

353
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:48,601
Grab the pole!

354
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:51,579
Help me pull the Emperor
onto the raft!

355
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:54,979
Here, so he can hold on to it.

356
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,722
Damned horse...

357
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,618
...nothing but trouble!

358
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,093
What's wrong with him?

359
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,336
He's dead.

360
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,469
Look how short the arrow is.

361
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:21,737
Poisoned.

362
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,771
It must belong to a dwarf.

363
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:31,315
- Fire! Make some noise, quickly!
- What are we to aim at?

364
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:34,015
Just shoot, you asshole!

365
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:35,717
Fire!

366
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,623
Fire!

367
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:35,250
Come, play something for the men.

368
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,721
- Look, isn't that a canoe?
- Where?

369
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:56,230
Over there under those trees,
it's coming towards us.

370
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:13,371
Keep the raft mid-stream.
It could be a trap.

371
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,890
<i>January twenty fourth.

372
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,893
<i>For the first time, we saw
two of the savages.

373
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,864
<i>They seemed to be trusting.

374
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:34,961
Pull the boat close.

375
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,262
I have the man. Hold him!

376
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:38,704
And I have the woman.

377
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,244
Look, there's a fish!

378
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,039
What did he say?

379
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,381
He says...

380
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,248
...he's from the Yagua Tribe.

381
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:32,720
He knows from his ancestors
that one day, the Sons of the Sun...

382
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:36,363
...would arrive from afar,
through great perils.

383
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:40,901
The strangers would come with
thunder from tubes.

384
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:44,803
They've waited a long time for the
coming of the Sons of the Sun.

385
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,934
For here on this river,
God never finished His Creation.

386
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:52,673
Look, gold!
Where did you get that?

387
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:03,991
Gold!

388
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:08,588
Gold! Ask him where he got it from.

389
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,193
Ask him where El Dorado is.

390
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,665
Where does this gold come from?

391
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,009
What did he say?

392
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:28,377
Has this savage ever heard
of our savior Jesus Christ...

393
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:32,143
...and of our mission and
the True Word of God?

394
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:41,329
This is a Bible.
It contains the Word of God...

395
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:46,635
...that we preach to bring light
into the darkness of their world.

396
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:53,468
Does he understand at all, that this
book contains the Word of God?

397
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,443
Take it in your hand, my son.

398
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:07,582
- He says, it doesn't talk.
- Kill him for this blasphemy!

399
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,260
<i>It is a tough business.

400
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,995
<i>These savages are hard to convert.

401
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,022
It won't be much longer.

402
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:45,383
El Dorado might be only
a few days away.

403
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,631
No more rust on the cannon.

404
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:54,232
We will shoot our enemies
with golden bullets.

405
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:59,733
And you, Okello, will serve
my food on golden platters.

406
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,109
And all of us will gain something.

407
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,445
Governships...

408
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,210
...provinces...

409
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,546
...and women.

410
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,320
And perhaps I'll even be free.

411
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:21,860
Let's not forget the most
important part of our mission...

412
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,862
...to spread the Word of God
to the savages.

413
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:30,997
I'm sure you'd like a golden cross
studded with jewels, Carvajal...

414
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:34,235
...instead of the silver one you lost.

415
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:24,015
All the land to our left
and all the land to our right...

416
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,356
...now belongs to us.

417
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:36,362
I solemnly and formally
take possession of all this land.

418
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:04,694
Our country is already six
times larger than Spain...

419
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:09,828
...and every day we drift,
makes it bigger.

420
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,769
Have you seen any solid ground
that would support your weight?

421
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:46,430
Okello, it's missing salt!

422
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:50,266
Fish and fruit we can
find now and then...

423
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,666
...but we've been out of salt
for a while.

424
01:06:55,478 --> 01:07:00,347
We're down to counting our
last grains of corn.

425
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:43,390
- Hold the horse!
- The horse has cut loose!

426
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,983
- Take the reins!
- Watch out!

427
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,596
Watch, that it doesn't jump off board!

428
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:29,165
Damn, get that horse away from me!
Get rid of it!

429
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:34,707
Throw that damned beast off the raft!

430
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:38,644
Go on!
Go for a swim!

431
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:45,279
- It wants to get back on board.
- Go away!

432
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,250
I think he's a dead man.

433
01:09:54,256 --> 01:10:00,354
In Mexico, I saw an army of Indians
flee at the sight of one single horse.

434
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:05,390
And besides, we could have
eaten meat for a week...

435
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:34,424
Don't worry, little one,
the horse will be alright.

436
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,465
Oh, my God, the Emperor!

437
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,075
The Emperor is dead!

438
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:24,537
<i>After our Emperor's death,
the fate of Ursua was sealed.

439
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:30,379
<i>Next morning, a few soldiers took
him away and he never came back.

440
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,140
Little mother,

441
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:38,436
...two by two...

442
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:42,175
...wafts the wind on my hair.

443
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,196
What are they shouting?

444
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:42,266
They're shouting,
"Meat is floating by."

445
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:21,406
Fire!

446
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,209
Set the village on fire!

447
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,554
Keep shooting, it'll scare them!

448
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,364
Don't go into the jungle!

449
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:44,902
Salt!

450
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,072
Salt!

451
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,680
I haven't had salt for a month!

452
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:11,825
She has gone without a trace.
We couldn't find her anywhere.

453
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,654
We have not seen any Indians either.

454
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:18,127
Let's march back to Pizarro.

455
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,627
Two men, more or less,
it won't matter to him.

456
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:25,969
I am sick of it. I'm leaving tonight.

457
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,009
If I march at night,
the Indians won't catch me.

458
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:32,444
In the day, I will hide.
I will get back to Pizarro.

459
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:37,143
We followed her tracks half a mile
into the jungle, then we lost them.

460
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,345
She simply vanished!

461
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:45,486
Then one of the men panicked
because of the silence...

462
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:48,995
...which always comes just before
someone gets killed.

463
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:54,629
I'd rather join the Indians,
than stay with this madman.

464
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:57,671
That man is a head taller than me.

465
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,540
That may change...

466
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:12,245
I'll explain my plan.
I have counted the river bends.

467
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:16,150
I've drawn a map in the sand.

468
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,490
We need about a day for each bend.

469
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:22,596
One, two...

470
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,757
...three, four, five...

471
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,865
...six, seven...

472
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,467
...eight...

473
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:30,593
...nine...

474
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:34,973
...ten.

475
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:41,238
I am the great traitor.
There can be no greater!

476
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:48,582
Whoever even thinks about deserting
will be cut into 198 pieces!

477
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:55,058
And then trampled upon until
you can paint the walls with him.

478
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,337
Whoever eats one grain too many...

479
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,805
...or drinks one drop of water
too much...

480
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:12,246
...will be locked up for 155 years!

481
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:22,613
If I, Aguirre, want the birds
to drop dead from the trees...

482
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:26,319
...the birds will drop dead
from the trees.

483
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,697
I am the Wrath of God!

484
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,469
The earth I walk upon
sees me and quakes!

485
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:48,042
But whoever follows me
and the river, will win untold riches.

486
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,655
But whoever deserts...

487
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,846
Get away from the tree!
Go to mid-stream!

488
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:09,890
- Hey, give me a pole!
- Watch out, the roof!

489
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,824
Watch out, the sedan-chair is falling!

490
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,498
Careful!

491
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,632
Over there.

492
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:25,299
The long arrows are
getting fashionable...

493
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:30,073
- Indians!
- Where? I don't see any.

494
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,074
- Make noise!
- I better get out of here.

495
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,463
<i>February first.

496
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:04,569
<i>The men's morale is at a low point.
I spoke with Aguirre.

497
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,881
Things are not turning out
as we expected.

498
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:11,912
We see nothing but
hunger and death.

499
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:15,279
We lose men,
but we never see the enemy.

500
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:19,726
Even El Dorado hasn't been
more than an illusion.

501
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,374
Mexico was no illusion!

502
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:48,213
If we turn back now,
others will come.

503
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,624
And they will succeed!

504
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:55,386
And we'll remain a failure!

505
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:59,858
Even if this land only consists
of trees and water...

506
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:02,169
...we will conquer it!

507
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:08,832
And it'll be milked dry
by those who follow us.

508
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:13,242
My men measure riches in gold.

509
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:18,042
It is more.

510
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,586
It is power and fame.

511
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:32,024
I despise them for it.

512
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:37,801
<i>I am sure, Aguirre is leading
us into destruction.

513
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:41,034
<i>I almost feel,
he does it deliberately.

514
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:47,548
<i>We can't even get ashore, since
the river flooded the jungle for miles.

515
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,985
<i>February twenty-second.

516
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,419
<i>The suffering is dreadful.

517
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:02,193
<i>Most men have fever
and hallucinations.

518
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:05,158
<i>Hardly anyone can stand upright.

519
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:10,095
<i>The soldier Justo Gonzales drank
my ink, thinking it was medicine.

520
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,006
<i>I can no longer write.

521
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,600
<i>We are drifting in circles.

522
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:46,228
I see a ship with sails...

523
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:48,635
...in a tall tree...

524
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:53,471
...and from the stern hangs a canoe.

525
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:01,009
The ship is in your imagination.

526
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:04,345
No floodwaters could rise this high.

527
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:08,180
We all have the fever.

528
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:12,159
It is only a mirage.

529
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:18,265
These things happen when
people are overly exhausted.

530
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:20,427
Shut up, monk!

531
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:24,767
We'll get that ship! It is real!
We'll sail to the Atlantic with it.

532
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:30,066
No, Lope de Aguirre, I won't go
with you. We are weak and hungry.

533
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:48,151
That is no ship. That is no forest.

534
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,056
That is no arrow.

535
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:57,537
We just imagine the arrows,
because we fear them.

536
01:27:57,872 --> 01:28:00,466
These arrows are real, take cover!

537
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:11,845
This arrow can't harm me.

538
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:15,785
This is not rain.

539
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:25,195
Monk, do not forget to pray,
lest God's end...

540
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:29,229
...will be uncomely.

541
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:47,745
<i>When we reach the sea...

542
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,684
<i>...we will build a bigger ship...

543
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:56,350
<i>...sail north and take Trinidad
from the Spanish crown.

544
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:06,325
<i>From there we'll sail on...

545
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:09,764
<i>...and take Mexico from Cortez.

546
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:14,472
<i>What great treachery this will be!

547
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:19,372
<i>Then, all of New Spain
will be in our hands...

548
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:23,011
<i>...and we'll stage history...

549
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:26,650
<i>...like others stage plays.

550
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,314
<i>I, the Wrath of God...

551
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:37,518
<i>...will marry my own daughter...

552
01:31:39,026 --> 01:31:42,860
<i>...and with her I will found
the purest dynasty...

553
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:45,762
<i>...the earth has ever seen.

554
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,159
<i>Together...

555
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:52,630
<i>...we shall rule
this entire continent.

556
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,710
<i>We will endure.

557
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:06,747
I am the Wrath of God!

558
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:10,381
Who else is with me?
