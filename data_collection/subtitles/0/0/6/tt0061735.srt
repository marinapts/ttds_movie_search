1
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,440
You know,
I just had a thought.

2
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,040
Why don't I check in a hotel
and rest.

3
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
- You go find your folks.
- Oh, John.

4
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,160
You wanted to meet them.
Let's go meet them.

5
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,080
The sooner we get it over with,
the better.

6
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,560
Mom may not even be at the gallery.
She'll probably be out to lunch.

7
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,920
Dad's at his office. You may not
meet them till dinner anyway.

8
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You may be wrong about them.

9
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,560
You should have called
and told them we were coming.

10
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,760
You may be in for the biggest shock
of your young life.

11
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,280
After 23 years living
in the same house with them...

12
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,680
don't you think I know
my own mother and father?

13
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,680
I hope so.

14
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,840
There's no problem.

15
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,160
We'll only be a minute, and then
we'd like to go out to Claremont Drive.

16
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,760
Right.

17
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll see if Mom's
in the office.

18
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,960
- Joey!
- Hilary, hi! How are you?

19
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,600
What a surprise.

20
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,000
- I'll be with you in just a moment.
- Okay.

21
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
- Strange.
- One of Hilary's favorites.

22
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,200
It's called a kinetic sculpture.

23
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,120
- A what?
- Look.

24
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,840
Why, isn't that something?

25
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,600
- Darling, what are you doing here?
- I thought Mother might be here.

26
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,680
Mrs. St. George, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Prentice.

27
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,920
Dr. Prentice,
I'm so pleased to meet you.

28
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,280
Mrs. St. George.
Pleasure to see you.

29
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,800
Christina's lunching
with Mr. Cazalet.

30
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,280
I can ring up.

31
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,440
No. Just tell her I'm back
and that I'll be home.

32
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Has something happened?
I mean, is anything wrong?

33
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,080
Something's happened,
but everything's right. Thanks.

34
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,960
How was Hawaii?
Was it fun?

35
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,200
Hawaii was simply unbelievable.

36
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,320
Do you live in San Francisco, Doctor,
or are you just visiting?

37
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,280
- I'm just passing through.
- I see.

38
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,720
- It was a pleasure to have met you.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,840
Bye-bye.

40
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,360
No, Hilary runs the gallery now,
but it's Mom who has all the ideas.

41
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,480
Her idea for filling hotel rooms
with originals is brilliant.

42
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,840
It gives people who stay there
time to decide if they want them.

43
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,760
The hotel gets supplied
with free decor.

44
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,800
The guests get to look at good paintings
instead of bad reproductions.

45
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,120
The painter gets a chance to make a sale
and Mom gets her commission.

46
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Next right.

47
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,080
- Isn't that clever?
- Oh, that is clever.

48
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,320
- What do I owe you?
- 10.50, mac.

49
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,440
Twelve bucks, right?

50
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,280
Right.

51
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,840
Right.

52
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,640
Oh, John.
Come meet Tillie.

53
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,120
Tillie, this is Dr. Prentice.
John, Miss Matilda Binks.

54
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,120
Pleased to meet you, Miss Binks.

55
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,600
I've certainly heard
a great deal about you.

56
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,560
What are you
doing home unexpected?

57
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,440
Your folks didn't know you was coming.
You told them you're back already?

58
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,560
I left a message for Mom
at the gallery.

59
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,600
It's lovely to see you.
I missed you.

60
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,720
You still ain't told me
why you're home early.

61
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,640
- You want those bags to go upstairs?
- Not my two. I'm not staying.

62
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,600
It's personal reasons.
I'll tell you all about it.

63
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,520
You eat any lunch yet,
or you expecting it now?

64
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,640
Could you make us sandwiches and coffee?
We'll have it on the terrace.

65
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,360
Do you like it?

66
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,520
It's beautiful.

67
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Come out
and look from the terrace.

68
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,120
- What?
- Hey, who's that?

69
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,720
That's Dorothy. Isn't she a knockout?
She helps Tillie during the week.

70
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,120
- Which days?
- Never mind.

71
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,880
You know, I ought to call my folks
and get that out of the way.

72
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,800
Okay. Use the phone in the study.

73
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,800
- Are you gonna introduce me?
- Not on the phone.

74
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,120
- Aren't you gonna tell them about me?
- I'd rather write to them.

75
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
I have to meet them, don't I?
Before I come to Geneva?

76
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,480
Or are we going to keep our marriage
a secret from them?

77
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,840
Why didn't I think of that?
See, that's a thought.

78
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,720
I'll shut this
in case Dorothy goes by.

79
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,080
Los Angeles, please.
Area code 213.

80
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,320
Axminster, two, four, six, nine, nine.
Time and charges.

81
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, I got a right
to my own opinions.

82
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,800
And you want my opinion?

83
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,120
I don't care to see a member
of my own race getting above hisself.

84
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,640
Then I don't want your opinion,
and if I ever do, I'll ask for it.

85
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,360
Oh, Tillie, I'm sorry.

86
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,000
I didn't mean that, but you can't mean
what you're saying either.

87
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,280
And you're so wrong.
Look.

88
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,280
You're the last person I'd have expected
to take such a silly attitude.

89
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,280
You know I've always loved you,
and you're just as black as he is.

90
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,080
How could it be all right for me to
love you and wrong for me to love him?

91
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,360
Will you just stop
and think about that?

92
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,680
Listen. What are we having
for dinner tonight?

93
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,120
- Gotta make it something special.
- Celery soup and rump steak.

94
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,360
Oh, now, come on.
Turtle soup and tournedos...

95
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,160
and one of your best pies.

96
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,120
It's Mom!

97
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,440
Joey, darling.
What the hell? Joey!

98
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,880
- Mom, I'm here!
- Hello, darling. Are you all right?

99
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
- There's nothing wrong, is there?
- Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine.

100
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,480
I rang the gallery to tell Hilary
that Cazalet agreed to our scheme.

101
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,560
He has? That's marvelous.
I knew he would.

102
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,720
She said you were back. She thought
you might have a surprise for me.

103
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,440
What did she mean?
Do I hear someone?

104
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,440
- Is there someone here?
- Oh, Mom, I'm so happy.

105
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,400
I've never been so happy in all my life.
I'm just...

106
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,080
Bursting. Yeah, I can see that.

107
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,920
And I'm already feeling happy for you.
Do I know him?

108
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,040
No. That's just it.
I only met him myself ten days ago.

109
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,960
You wouldn't believe what's happened
in just ten days.

110
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,600
I think I might if you'd pipe down
long enough to tell me.

111
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,520
- Mom...
- Lots of wonderful things happen...

112
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,160
He's so wonderful!

113
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,640
I've never known anyone like him.
Never known anything like this.

114
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,440
I fell in love with him
in 20 minutes.

115
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,160
Well, that was quick.

116
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,080
Well, Dad, I wanted to stop
on the way back...

117
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,840
but time got so short
and I've got to get to work.

118
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,080
Yeah, but I still don't understand
why you couldn't spend one day with us.

119
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,760
Well, the fact is, Dad,
I met this girl.

120
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
You what? You met a girl?
Why didn't you say so?

121
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,880
Mary, he says he met a girl.
Why, that's good news.

122
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,280
- She live up there in San Francisco?
- She lives up here. I'm at her house.

123
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,600
He says he's at her house now,
the girl's house.

124
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,280
Well, that's different, son.
Where'd you meet her? Hawaii?

125
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes, in Hawaii,
and I wanted to meet her folks, see?

126
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,840
That sounds good, son.
I mean, serious.

127
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,640
Yes, it's serious.

128
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,560
Well, this is quite a surprise.

129
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,280
Yeah, she's surprising
in a lot of ways, Dad.

130
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
Your mother says,
"Is she pretty? '

131
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,160
- Yes, she's very pretty.
- She's pretty. What?

132
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,160
Your mother says,
"How old is she, son?"

133
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Mary, what the hell difference
does that make?

134
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,720
Well, she's only 23, Dad.

135
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,760
Twenty-three. Well, that's good.
You want my opinion?

136
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,000
You're 37.
That's just the right difference.

137
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,440
Women age faster than men,
you know what I mean?

138
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,200
- You reckon to marry the girl, son?
- Well, we've been talking about it.

139
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,360
But...

140
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,720
Dad, there's one or two problems,
you see?

141
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,200
That I'll write to you about...

142
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,040
on the plane to New York tonight,
all right?

143
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,160
He's so calm...

144
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,200
and sure of everything.

145
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
He doesn't have
any tensions in him.

146
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,960
He knows what he believes...

147
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,520
and what he thinks is right
and why and where he's going.

148
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,520
Oh, Mom, there's one thing
I must tell you.

149
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,360
He was married before,
and he had a son.

150
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
It was so tragic.

151
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,440
Both his wife and his son were killed
in a train accident...

152
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,400
in Belgium eight years ago.

153
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,800
And John...

154
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,280
I haven't even told you
his name.

155
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,680
Mom, it's John Wade Prentice.

156
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,600
Isn't that a lovely name?

157
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,400
John Wade...

158
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,080
Joanna Prentice...

159
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,560
I'll be.

160
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,720
But Mom...

161
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,000
there's something else
that I must tell you...

162
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,760
that John's been concerned about,
very deeply concerned.

163
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,240
He's been worrying for the past week
whether you and Dad would be upset if...

164
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,720
Well, it's about time.

165
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,000
I was wondering where you'd been.

166
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,600
Mom...

167
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,560
this is John.

168
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,600
Doctor Prentice...

169
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm so pleased to meet you.

170
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,440
I'm pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Drayton.

171
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,600
I take it Joanna's already busted out
with the big news.

172
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,400
Well, she has told me a good deal
and all very quickly too.

173
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,120
Well, she's only known me
for ten days...

174
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,440
so she can't tell you
when I'm blushing.

175
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,080
That could be another problem
for us.

176
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,440
Mrs. Drayton,
I'm medically qualified...

177
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,920
so I hope you wouldn't
think it presumptuous if I say...

178
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,120
you ought to sit down
before you fall down.

179
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,320
He thinks you're gonna faint
because he's a Negro.

180
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,200
Well...

181
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,640
I don't think
I'm going to faint.

182
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,680
But I'll sit down anyway.

183
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,920
Can't we all sit down?

184
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,600
Well...

185
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,400
I suppose it would be all right
if I said, "My goodness," wouldn't it?

186
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,080
Well, my goodness.

187
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,200
- Do we mind her saying, "My goodness"?
- I don't mind.

188
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,200
What did they say?
Did you tell them about me?

189
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,360
- Yes.
- What'd they say?

190
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,800
They said I sounded serious
and asked if you were pretty.

191
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,240
I said you were.

192
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,840
They said this was a big surprise.

193
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,640
I said it was.

194
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,320
Well, what did they say when you
told them I wasn't a colored girl?

195
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,000
I didn't. It felt like
too big a shock for the telephone.

196
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,120
After all, a lot of people will think
that we're a very shocking pair.

197
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,440
Isn't that right?

198
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,160
I know what you mean.

199
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
Tillie's made us some sandwiches.

200
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,120
- Let's go outside.
- Yes, let's.

201
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,040
- Come on, Dr. Prentice.
- I can explain it all in two minutes.

202
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,320
You see, John was invited to lecture
at Hawaii University...

203
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,280
and we met at this big party
at the dean's.

204
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,640
After the party,
we went for a long drive.

205
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,640
- Thank you.
- And since then, we've been together.

206
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,120
We've been swimming every day.

207
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,920
Then John was supposed to fly back to
Los Angeles Saturday to see his parents.

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,520
That's where they live.

209
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,720
Thank you, Tillie.

210
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,320
Try one of these.
They're great.

211
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,520
- Do you want some coffee?
- No, thanks. No coffee.

212
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,520
Does your father know
that you're back?

213
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,000
No, I was going to phone him.
Do you think he'd come back early if...

214
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,400
He's coming back early, all right.
He's playing golf with Monsignor Ryan.

215
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,800
That's marvelous.

216
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,760
Then he can meet John
and we can all talk over dinner...

217
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,560
because John has to fly
to New York tonight to see a friend...

218
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,080
at Columbia University.

219
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,080
Then tomorrow night,
he's flying to Geneva...

220
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,560
to do three month's work
for the World Health Organization.

221
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,760
And I intend to fly to Geneva next week
so that we can be married.

222
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,680
And that's the whole situation.

223
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,800
In a nutshell.

224
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,360
Except that he thinks...

225
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,960
that the fact he's a Negro and I'm not
creates a serious problem.

226
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,000
Does he?

227
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,280
I've told him 97 times...

228
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,680
that it wouldn't make the slightest
difference to you or Dad.

229
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,880
But he just wouldn't believe me.
So that's why we're here.

230
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,840
And that's why he's watching you
so closely right now...

231
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,240
while he's pretending
not to watch you at all.

232
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,680
She's absolutely right, Mrs. Drayton.
I'm sorry.

233
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,640
I told her not to spring all this
on you so suddenly.

234
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,080
But... Look,
if your father's coming home...

235
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,480
you could at least say
that I'm somebody you met in Hawaii.

236
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,080
- Now, really?
- Give him a half hour to get adjusted.

237
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,360
But what for?
He still has to be told, doesn't he?

238
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,840
Well, you should make up your minds
because I think I just heard his car.

239
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,040
Mr. Matt.

240
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,480
- Hi. How are you?
- All hell's done broke loose.

241
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,720
- That waste disposal out again?
- It ain't that.

242
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,440
Just remember,
all hell's done broke loose.

243
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,800
- What's happened? Where's Christina?
- She's on the terrace with little Joey.

244
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,040
- With Joey?
- And somebody called Dr. Prentice.

245
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,240
Doctor? There's a doc...

246
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,360
Well, what's wrong?
What's happened? Joey!

247
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,400
Here he comes.

248
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,000
- Daddy! How are you?
- What's happened? What are you doing?

249
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,240
- Tillie said there was a doctor here.
- There is! Dr. John Wade Prentice.

250
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,880
- This is my dad.
- Pleased to meet you.

251
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,760
How are you? Nice to know you.
But what is it?

252
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,880
- Is something wrong?
- There's nothing wrong.

253
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,320
I decided to come home early.

254
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,200
Oh, Dr. Prentice and I
met in Hawaii...

255
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,920
and we flew back in the same plane
this morning.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,320
Oh, well, sit down.

257
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,000
I thought something was really wrong.
Tillie said...

258
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,720
Tillie's behaving very strangely today.
Would you like coffee?

259
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,960
No, thanks. I have a date to play golf
with Monsignor Ryan.

260
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,680
How are you? What's the matter,
you having a chill?

261
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,640
No, darling, I'm fine.

262
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,520
I...

263
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,960
Doctor, where are you practicing?
In San Francisco?

264
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,120
- Sit down.
- No, sir.

265
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,680
I'm just here for one day.

266
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,560
Oh, where is your practice?
Hawaii?

267
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,400
Well, no, not...
I'm not established in any one place.

268
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,760
I'm in tropical medicines, mostly,
in Africa...

269
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,040
these past few years.

270
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,240
Well, that sounds interesting.

271
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,480
Everything about Dr. Prentice
is interesting.

272
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,320
I'm sure it is.

273
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
I wish I had more time,
but if you'll excuse me.

274
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,560
Couldn't you be a half hour late
and stay and talk with us?

275
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,000
I'd love to, but I mustn't keep
the Monsignor waiting.

276
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,360
No, I'm gonna be late as it is.
Will I be seeing you later, Doctor?

277
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,560
You certainly will.

278
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,040
Good.
Well, that's good.

279
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,360
Dr. Prentice will be here
for dinner, Matt.

280
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh, fine. Then you can tell me
all about the African...

281
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,880
There's a great deal to tell too.
Isn't there, Mom?

282
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
Well, fine.
See you all later.

283
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,520
What the hell
is going on here?

284
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,600
- This doesn't make sense either.
- Well, I told you, didn't I?

285
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,560
What'd you tell him?
Look, Chris...

286
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,600
if you don't explain to me
in the next few minutes...

287
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,920
I can explain it, Mr. Drayton.

288
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,880
You can?
Well, let's have it

289
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,800
Well, it's my fault.

290
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,600
You see,
we have sort of a situation here.

291
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,840
Joanna and I didn't just meet
in Hawaii.

292
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,760
We spend a good deal of time
together.

293
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,160
I mean, all the time
after we met.

294
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,560
And, well, we have this problem:

295
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,720
I fell in love with your daughter.

296
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
And, as incredible
as it may seem...

297
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
she fell in love with me.

298
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,920
And we flew back
to San Francisco...

299
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,760
to see if you or Mrs. Drayton would have
any objections if we got married.

300
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,400
Joanna told her mother
as soon as she walked in...

301
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,240
and I had the stupid idea,
that maybe...

302
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,160
there was some way to...

303
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,360
break this gently.

304
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Daddy, you're making
John and me nervous.

305
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Am I?
Well, I wouldn't want to do that.

306
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,720
I wouldn't want to make anybody nervous.
How about you? Are you nervous?

307
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,600
Sit down, Doctor,
before you make me nervous.

308
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,480
Would anybody like
a cup of coffee?

309
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,200
What did she say
when Joanna told her?

310
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,160
- Did she raise any objections?
- None, so far. There hasn't been time.

311
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,160
What objections?

312
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,240
Dad, I know this is sort of a shock
because it's sudden and unexpected...

313
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,120
and it never occurred to me
that I might fall in love with a Negro.

314
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,840
But I did, and nothing in the world
is gonna change that.

315
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,440
Even if you had any objections,
I wouldn't let him go now if...

316
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,360
you were the governor of Alabama...
I mean, if Mom were.

317
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,240
Tell him, will you?

318
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,520
Tell John if you have any objections
and then you could go play golf.

319
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,320
Well, what is it
you expect me to say?

320
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,280
If you want me to think about this,
you'll have to give me time to think.

321
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,080
The doctor says you have a problem.
You certainly have.

322
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,840
If you're expecting a sensible
statement, you'll have to give me time.

323
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,760
Does that sound reasonable?

324
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,160
It's reasonable, Mr. Drayton,
but not quite practical.

325
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
You see, Matt...

326
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
there's sort of
a special problem.

327
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,720
See, I've got to fly
to New York tonight...

328
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,680
and on to Switzerland
tomorrow night.

329
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,880
Yes, and what Joey wants...
what she proposes...

330
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,880
is to go to Geneva herself
so they can be married...

331
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,840
within the next couple of weeks.

332
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,880
What the hell is all the rush?

333
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,840
We know that we want
to get married.

334
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,400
And unless somebody does have any
objections, why should we waste time?

335
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,320
John and I aren't gonna
change our minds.

336
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,840
Are you saying...
Are you telling me...

337
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,600
that you want an answer today...

338
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,520
about how your mother and I feel?

339
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,760
Of course. We want you and Mom
to state absolutely clearly...

340
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,400
that you have
no objections whatever...

341
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,840
and that when we do get married,
we'll have your blessing.

342
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,520
Now, are you gonna play golf
or not?

343
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,080
No.

344
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,520
I'll just call it off.
Excuse me, Doctor.

345
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,600
And that's my dad.
Do you like him?

346
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,760
- I don't know. Does he like me?
- I don't know either.

347
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,720
When he puts on
his American eagle face...

348
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,960
nobody can tell what he's thinking,
except Mom.

349
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,360
I don't think he liked any of us
after the silly way we began.

350
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,040
Excuse me, will you?
Give John some more coffee.

351
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
She's beautiful, Joanna.

352
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,640
She's even better looking than you.
You know that?

353
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,040
Hello, Edie?

354
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,600
Two things, Edie.
Both of them urgent.

355
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,480
Call up Monsignor Ryan and tell him
I can't play this afternoon.

356
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,560
Tell him something's come up,
something personal at home.

357
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
Then call the library...

358
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,280
and see if they've got any dope
on a John Wade Prentice.

359
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,000
Prentice. He's a doctor of medicine.
Fellow about 35, 36...

360
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
- Oh, Matt.
- He's a colored fellow.

361
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,440
Yeah.
If they haven't got anything...

362
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,000
call up the medical association
and see what they've got.

363
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,680
Get anything you can, will you, Edie?
All right. Hurry and call me back.

364
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,160
Surely there can't be
any necessity for that.

365
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,880
- It can't do any harm, either.
- But Joey said he was lecturing...

366
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,440
at the university in Hawaii.

367
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,320
Tell me something. This ever occur
to you that this might happen?

368
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,280
Never occurred to me either.
Not once.

369
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,760
Can you tell me your reaction?

370
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,000
- How do you feel about it?
- Oh, I don't know.

371
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,240
I was shaken at first.
I still am, I suppose.

372
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,760
But, Matt, they're serious.
They mean what they're saying.

373
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,680
Both of them.
They know what they're doing.

374
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,360
No, they may mean what they're saying,
I accept that.

375
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,080
But they don't know what they're doing.
I won't accept that.

376
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,480
If I'm not intruding...

377
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,680
Of course not.
Please, come in.

378
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,840
I'd like to have a couple of minutes
with the two of you, if I may?

379
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,760
Sure, Doctor.
Come on in.

380
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,040
There's something you both
ought to know. I made a decision.

381
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,720
Joanna doesn't know about it,
and I don't see why she should.

382
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,040
What is it, Doctor?

383
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,160
Joanna thinks she's committed...

384
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,440
and that our whole future
is settled...

385
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,680
but there is no real commitment.

386
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,320
And up to now,
nothing is settled at all.

387
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,760
I don't understand.

388
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,720
Joanna said you're going to be married
no matter what we think about it.

389
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,560
Well, that's not the case.

390
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,520
Unless you two approve...
and without any reservations at all...

391
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,920
there won't be any marriage.

392
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,960
Well, why, John?

393
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,880
Why have you decided that?

394
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,360
Well, Mrs. Drayton...

395
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,640
this thing has happened so quickly...

396
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,440
I'm just as startled
as you must be.

397
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,280
Two weeks ago, I would have said
such a thing was inconceivable.

398
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,360
But two weeks ago...

399
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,280
I had not met Joanna.

400
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,920
She's not at all
like anyone I've ever known.

401
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,920
It's not just that our color difference
doesn't matter to her.

402
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,800
It's that she doesn't seem to think
there is any difference.

403
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,600
The trouble is,
this thing has come up...

404
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,120
at a time when I already have
all the problems I need.

405
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,200
And I feel that I couldn't afford
to get married...

406
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,240
if it meant that I would have to take
on any special problems...

407
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,080
in addition to those
we're obviously going to have.

408
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,960
When you say "special problems,"
Doctor, what do you mean?

409
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,680
Well...

410
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,080
Your attitude, Mr. Drayton...

411
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,040
and yours, Mrs. Drayton.

412
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,160
Joanna is very close
to both of you.

413
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,960
If, by marrying me, she damaged
her relationship with either of you...

414
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,640
the pain of it
would be too much for her.

415
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,480
I wouldn't know how to deal
with that kind of situation.

416
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,920
In any case,
I wouldn't even want to try.

417
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Well, I'm glad you told us,
Doctor.

418
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,520
Don't misunderstand me.
I love your daughter.

419
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,640
There is nothing I wouldn't do to keep
her as happy as she was the day we met.

420
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,880
But it seems to me,
without your approval...

421
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,800
we will make no sense at all.

422
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,160
That is why I'm asking for...

423
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,800
the clearest possible statement
of what your attitude is going to be.

424
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,760
I appreciate that, Doctor.

425
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,160
It's almost in the form
of an ultimatum.

426
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,640
Not quite, Mr. Drayton.

427
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,480
All you have to say
is good-bye.

428
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,920
Well, that's where it's at.

429
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,760
Thank you for the opportunity
to speak my peace.

430
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,600
Well...

431
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,960
still think you ought to have someone
check on him?

432
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,880
No.

433
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,800
He's right about Joey too.

434
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,960
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

435
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,880
Thank God he is. That's the way I feel.
Thank God he's right.

436
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,800
She's 23 years old,
and the way she is...

437
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,320
is just exactly the way
we brought her up to be.

438
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,960
We answered her questions.
She listened to our answers.

439
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,160
We told her it was wrong
to believe...

440
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,080
that white people were somehow
essentially superior to black people...

441
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,000
or the brown or the red
or the yellow ones, for that matter.

442
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,920
People who thought that way
were wrong to think that way.

443
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,800
Sometimes hateful, usually stupid,
but always wrong.

444
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,280
That's what we said...

445
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,480
and when we said it,
we did not add...

446
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,960
"But don't ever fall in love
with a colored man."

447
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,000
Edie, Mr. Drayton.
Do you want the whole story?

448
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,040
- Yeah, what is it, Edie?
- He's an important guy.

449
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,920
Just the main points:
Born Los Angeles, 1930...

450
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,960
graduated maxima cum laude
John Hopkins, '54...

451
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,760
assistant professor,
Yale Medical School, '55...

452
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,600
three years professor,
London School of Tropical Medicine...

453
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,560
three years assistant director,
World Health Organization...

454
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,200
two textbooks and a list of monographs
and medical society honors...

455
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,760
as long as your arm.

456
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,040
Married Elizabeth Bowers, 1955,
one son, John Wade.

457
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,800
Oh, both killed in an accident
in 1959.

458
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,600
- There's a lot more here.
- No, that's all right. Thanks.

459
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,960
What's the $2.20?

460
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,760
He made a call to Los Angeles
to his parents.

461
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,800
I guess he doesn't bum
free telephone calls either.

462
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,160
I can certainly understand why he didn't
have much to say about himself.

463
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,680
Who the hell would believe him?

464
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,600
I beg your pardon, lady.

465
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,520
He loves me, he loves me not.

466
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,960
Tell me, what do you think? Aren't they
exactly the way I said they were?

467
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,120
I must admit,
they are very special people.

468
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
- Shall I tell you something?
- What's that?

469
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,920
For a whole week,
I've been nervous.

470
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,320
No. I don't believe it.

471
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,440
Not about what they'd ultimately feel.
Just about their first reaction.

472
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,440
I thought it was just possible
for the first time in 23 years...

473
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,640
they might let me down
for the first half hour.

474
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,200
You're a phony. You know that?
You're a big phony.

475
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,560
Well...

476
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,680
She's always been
a happy human being.

477
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,000
She laughed out loud
before she was six months old.

478
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,280
She was happy as a baby.

479
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,120
Happy as a little girl.
Happy all through school and college.

480
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,960
But I don't think
I've ever seen her...

481
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,160
quite so happy
as she is right now.

482
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,240
And I have to be happy
for her, Matt.

483
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,840
And I am.

484
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,840
I feel happy for her.

485
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,520
And proud of the fact
that we helped make her.

486
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,880
And whatever happens now,
I feel glad...

487
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,120
that Joey's Joey.

488
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,560
How are you today?
Having a steak fry, huh?

489
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,280
Well, now, there she is.
How are you today?

490
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,600
Wanna give me a lift to Market Street?
Save me a cab.

491
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,520
You know it, doll.

492
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,240
I hope these is better
than the last we had, hotshot.

493
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,600
Lady, don't look at me. I deliver it.
I don't rustle the cattle.

494
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,280
You said to remind you
to open the wine.

495
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,280
Civil rights is one thing.

496
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,280
This here is something else.

497
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
I went out on to the terrace.

498
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,240
Oh, I'll never forget it.
It was so beautiful.

499
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,040
It was already dark
and the moon was rising.

500
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,960
I guess I didn't see him at first
because I was looking at the view.

501
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,520
But he was standing there.

502
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,720
Then all of a sudden
he moved or something, and I jumped.

503
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,400
And he just stood there,
looking at me and sort of...

504
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,680
- Ah, you're burning your shirt.
- Oh, yes. Sort of smiling.

505
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,360
"Hello," I said.
"Who are you?"

506
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,360
And I think he thought I was...

507
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,280
you know, attractive.

508
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,680
Anyway, finally, he said...

509
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,000
"Well, do you think
it could possibly matter?"

510
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,200
- And it's just crazy, and I admit it.
- You'd better let me do this.

511
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,560
But 20 minutes later,
I felt I was in love with him.

512
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,400
Mom, how long did it take you
to fall in love with Dad?

513
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Oh, well, nothing like
so long as 20 minutes.

514
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,160
- You mean, is that really true?
- Yes, that's really true.

515
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,960
Oh, Mom.

516
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,280
Joey, I want to ask you something.

517
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,360
How deeply are you and John in...
No, I have no right to ask.

518
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,640
How deeply involved? Do you mean,
have we been to bed together?

519
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,800
I don't mind you asking me that.
We haven't.

520
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
He wouldn't.

521
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,960
I don't think he was in doubt
about my feelings, but he wouldn't.

522
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,880
You're burning my shirt.

523
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,760
He's been concerned the whole time
about my getting hurt somehow.

524
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,960
They're still talking.

525
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,760
Wouldn't you think
they'd have said everything by now?

526
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,520
Are you saying they don't have
any special sense of rhythm?

527
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,200
That's right.

528
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
But, hell, you can see it.

529
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,720
You can't turn on the television set
without seeing those kids dancing...

530
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,200
and I say the colored kids
are better than the white kids.

531
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,360
But there's an explanation for that.
It's our dancing, and it's our music.

532
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,120
We brought it here.

533
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,400
I mean, you can do the Watusi...

534
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,960
but we are the Watusi,
if you know what I mean.

535
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,880
I remember,
when I was about your age...

536
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,880
my sports editor telling me that Negroes
would never be able to play baseball.

537
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,800
Now, I suppose if he wanted to...

538
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,360
Willie Mays could be elected
mayor of San Francisco.

539
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,200
I own a newspaper,
but I couldn't be elected dogcatcher.

540
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,080
Well, I don't guess
you want to be dogcatcher any more...

541
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,120
than he wants to be
mayor of San Francisco.

542
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,040
No, I suppose that's right.

543
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,400
Doctor, we've talked about
a good many things...

544
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,160
but there's one thing
we haven't talked about.

545
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,600
Have you given any thought to
the problems your children will have?

546
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,440
Yes, and they'll have some.
And we'll have the children.

547
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,560
Otherwise,
you couldn't call it a marriage.

548
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,840
Is that the way Joey feels?

549
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,160
She feels that all of our children will
be president of the United States...

550
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,080
and they'll all have
colorful administrations.

551
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,400
Well, you made her, Mr. Drayton.

552
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,080
I just met her in Hawaii.

553
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,520
But how do you feel
about that problem?

554
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,160
Well, frankly, I think your daughter
is a bit optimistic.

555
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,360
I'd settle
for secretary of state.

556
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,080
Would you think it was some kind
of cowardice if I told you...

557
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,920
that no matter how confident you two are
I'm just a little scared.

558
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,000
No, it wouldn't.

559
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,480
But you never know.
Things are changing.

560
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,840
I have a feeling they're
not changing anywhere else...

561
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,880
as fast as they are
in my own backyard.

562
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,240
Just tell me this.

563
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,160
Don't you think this quick decision...

564
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,920
about how we feel about this thing
is just a little unfair?

565
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,560
In a way, I do.

566
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,520
But it wasn't my idea
that everything be settled so quickly.

567
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,200
Your daughter said
there's no problem.

568
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,760
She says, "My dad is a lifelong fighting
liberal who loathes race prejudice...

569
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,560
and has spent his whole life
fighting against discrimination."

570
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,360
She said, "My parents...
They'll welcome you with open arms."

571
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,320
And I said...

572
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,640
"Oh, I sure want to meet them."

573
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,320
Telephone!
It's Los Angeles!

574
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,440
- Take it in my study.
- Thank you.

575
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,960
- Hello?
- Dr. Prentice?

576
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,680
- Yes, this is he.
- Hello. That you, Little John?

577
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,560
Hi, Dad. What's up, man?
Dr. Graves call again?

578
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,200
Oh, no, it's not that, son.
I just had an idea.

579
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,800
What would you say to us
flying up there to spend the evening?

580
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,760
- This evening?
- We could be up there at 6:30.

581
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,520
I thought maybe we could take you
and your young lady friend for dinner.

582
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,640
- Tell them to come to dinner.
- Just a minute.

583
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,440
- I'm having dinner with her folks.
- Don't be silly.

584
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,080
- Tell them they're invited to dinner.
- Who's that speaking? The young lady?

585
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,680
Yes, that's her.

586
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,560
No, just a minute. You haven't asked
your mother, and there's Tillie.

587
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,000
Won't you come to dinner,
you and Mrs. Prentice?

588
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,560
John and I will meet your plane.

589
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,800
- Stop butting in.
- Who am I talking to? John?

590
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,240
Hi, Dad.

591
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,280
Looks like she wants us
even if you don't. We want to meet her.

592
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,600
- So we'll see you at 6:30. What?
- Oh, no.

593
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,480
- See?
- Your mother says she's pleased.

594
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,400
Oh, hell, he knows that.
All right, son.

595
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,760
- Dad!
- We'll see you later. Bye.

596
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,160
What's the matter?

597
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,720
Mom!

598
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,000
John's father and mother
are coming to dinner.

599
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,920
Oh, good.

600
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,200
- Marvelous.
- We'll meet their plane at 6:30.

601
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,160
Fine.
You'll tell Tillie, won't you?

602
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,800
I told you,
my folks, they don't...

603
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,960
They think
you're a colored girl.

604
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,680
- Why didn't you tell them?
- I was gonna write to them.

605
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,440
What difference does it make?

606
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,480
Do you think they wouldn't come?
Call them back and tell them.

607
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,480
They're gonna know anyway at 6:30
because I'll go with you to meet them.

608
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,920
That's not a good idea.
I'll meet them.

609
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,880
It gives me a chance to explain.
I have to explain.

610
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,520
Why do you keep trying
to dramatize everything?

611
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,160
Look, I've told Pete and Judith that
we'll meet them for a drink at 5:30.

612
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,560
It gives us just enough time
to get to the airport.

613
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,920
She's my best and oldest friend
so you've just got to let them meet you.

614
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,240
Did he tell you
about this medical plan of his?

615
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,840
No. What?

616
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,640
It's the damndest thing
you ever heard of.

617
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,600
They put a whole medical school
on about 20 trucks.

618
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,400
Then they run
into some African country...

619
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,680
pick up the brightest native kids...
hundreds at a time...

620
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,400
and put them through courses just like
they do the U.S. Army Corpsmen.

621
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,200
Only his idea is
that they're all specialists.

622
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,640
You know, each one trained
to do one simple thing...

623
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,000
like sewing up a wound
or delivering a baby or what have you.

624
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,680
They go into places where people
have never heard of an aspirin tablet...

625
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,200
let alone a doctor.

626
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,640
Imagine what that means.

627
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,440
For every thousand kids they train,
they can save a million lives a year.

628
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,360
Now just think of that.

629
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,880
He seems to have made
quite an impression on you.

630
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,920
Yeah.

631
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,440
I asked him how he got so far.
You know, he's only 37.

632
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,120
He said he thought he got the best
breaks because everybody he met...

633
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,480
didn't want him to think
they were prejudiced against him.

634
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,600
Yeah, he made an impression, all right.
I wouldn't know how to fault him.

635
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,720
Are you trying to fault him?

636
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,160
No, I'm not trying to fault him.
You know, his father is a mailman.

637
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,600
Retired now.
Lives in Los Angeles.

638
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,920
Now how do you suppose
a colored mailman...

639
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,640
produced a son
with all the qualities he has?

640
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,600
- You'll find out this evening.
- What?

641
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,040
Guess who's coming to dinner?

642
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,760
Who?

643
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
You mean, his parents?

644
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,760
Now wait a minute.

645
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,400
- Whose idea was that?
- Joey invited them.

646
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,720
Yeah, Joey. We're being pressurized.
You know that, don't you?

647
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,960
First there wasn't gonna be a marriage
unless we approved.

648
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,560
Then we had one day
to make up our minds.

649
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,520
Now we have to spend hours entertaining
somebody we never heard of.

650
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,880
What the hell
is coming off here?

651
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,120
Oh, don't look at
those baby pictures.

652
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,520
That was at Klosters,
the year before last.

653
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,440
I'll get it!
Just a second.

654
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,560
Monsignor Ryan!
How wonderful to see you.

655
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,960
- Well, good afternoon.
- Come on in. Good afternoon.

656
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,400
Why are you here
when you should be in Hawaii?

657
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,520
What is the problem that caused your
father to chicken out on our golf game?

658
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,040
- Who is this gentleman?
- Monsignor, this is Dr. John Prentice.

659
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,000
We met in Hawaii 11 days ago.
The two of us are going to be married.

660
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,200
Are you, indeed?
I take it you mean to each other.

661
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,160
- Dr. Prentice.
- Monsignor.

662
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,520
Well, of course,
you're the problem.

663
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,040
I'm afraid I am.

664
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,960
I knew nothing of this.
Why haven't your parents informed me?

665
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,280
They didn't know either.
We only flew back this morning.

666
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,160
Excuse me a second.
I forgot to tell Tillie something.

667
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,720
Well...

668
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,920
- This was all very sudden, was it not?
- Yes, it was.

669
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,360
I suppose you two have had time
to consider what you're doing.

670
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,600
No, we've not.

671
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,520
We'll be two more for dinner.
How many steaks did you get?

672
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,840
I got four
'cause I was told four.

673
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,240
Order two more because the doctor's
father and mother are coming.

674
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,080
- We'll be six.
- His father and mother! Here?

675
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,440
That's right.
If the butcher can't send 'em...

676
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,040
tell him to put 'em
in a taxi.

677
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,440
It's gettin' more like
a holy rollers meetin' every minute.

678
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,560
Of course!
I know about you.

679
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,040
I read an article about you
in "Common Wheel."

680
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,760
I shall want to talk to you
about that.

681
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,720
You know, this fellow you brought home
is a very important man?

682
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,120
- Are you aware of that?
- I'm wholly aware of it.

683
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,840
When I'm married to him,
I'll be important.

684
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,120
I guess you will,
as a matter of fact.

685
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,600
- Where's Arnold Palmer?
- Dad and Mom are in the garden.

686
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,960
Good. Well, just go on
with what you're doing. Fore!

687
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,280
Of all the friends we've ever had,
I guess he's the closest.

688
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,760
We're not Catholics, but he and Dad
and Mom have done things together.

689
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,760
You know,
sat on committees and things.

690
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,640
He's a wonderful man,
and we love him.

691
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,200
You're a remarkable fellow, Mike.

692
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,200
You get younger every minute.

693
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,320
- Did you...
- Yes, I've just seen him.

694
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Handsome fellow, isn't he?

695
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,360
Little Joey is nothing less
than radiant.

696
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,520
It warms me chilly old heart
just to look at her.

697
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,640
Aren't you just
a little shocked?

698
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,960
Shocked?
Why should I be shocked?

699
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,000
I've known a good many cases
of marriages between races in my time.

700
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,160
Strangely enough,
they usually work out quite well.

701
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,880
I don't know why.

702
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,080
Maybe because it requires
some special quality of effort...

703
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,360
more consideration and compassion...

704
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,160
than most marriages
seem to generate these days.

705
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,040
- Could that be it?
- Yes, it could.

706
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,320
I'm glad you said that.
That's a beautiful thought.

707
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,240
You do have beautiful thoughts.

708
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,160
That's my trade, you know.

709
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,040
What about laddie over here?
You making heavy weather of it?

710
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,520
You know, this man is quite
a famous fellow in his own right.

711
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,000
He's done incredible work in Asia
and some awful place in Africa.

712
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,200
Mom! Hilary's here.
She wants to see you.

713
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,320
Excuse me, will you? Express some more
beautiful thoughts to the lad there.

714
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,680
Thank you.

715
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,640
I hope you won't think
that I'm prying, Doctor...

716
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,600
but naturally
one is curious.

717
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,800
- Naturally.
- We are going to be married.

718
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,080
Are you?

719
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,160
Well, I didn't even know.

720
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,360
I mean, Christina
hadn't even mentioned that...

721
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,680
She didn't know.
It was a surprise to her too.

722
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,680
A surprise.
Well, I should think it was.

723
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,800
My dear!

724
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,880
Joey tells me that congratulations
are in order, and you didn't even know.

725
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,600
What's the problem, Hilary?
What brings you all the way up here?

726
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,960
- Mr. Cazalet phoned about the pictures.
- Oh, that. Excuse us, will you?

727
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,080
I'll walk out to your car
with you.

728
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,600
- I hope I'll be seeing you shortly.
- Actually, no.

729
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,880
Dr. Prentice is leaving tonight...

730
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,840
and Joey within
the next couple of weeks.

731
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,280
Well, then you must permit me
to wish you every happiness.

732
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,480
Come along.

733
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,080
My poor dear,
what a shock for you.

734
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,640
I knew something was up
when I came into the gallery.

735
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,040
But this!
Whatever are you going to do about it?

736
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,960
- I mean, the child is of age.
- Yes, the child is 23.

737
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,200
Why didn't you simply ring up
with the Cazalet information?

738
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,960
Well, I must admit,
I was intensely curious.

739
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,520
I couldn't believe it.

740
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,000
It's so unlike Joey to do anything
so appallingly stupid.

741
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,040
- Yes, come along.
- But what you must be going through.

742
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,400
You must try not to worry about it.

743
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,600
Now I have some instructions
for you.

744
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,520
I want you to go straight back
to the gallery. Start your motor.

745
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,440
When you to the gallery,
tell Jennifer...

746
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,400
she will be looking after things
temporarily.

747
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,440
She's to give me a ring if there's
anything she can't deal with herself.

748
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,400
Then go into the office
and make out a check for cash...

749
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,960
for the sum of $5,000.

750
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,400
Then carefully...

751
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,680
remove absolutely everything...

752
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,920
that might subsequently remind me
that you had ever been there...

753
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,320
including that yellow thing
with the blue bulbs...

754
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,240
which you have
such an affection for.

755
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,920
Then take the check for $5,000...

756
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,840
which I feel you deserve...

757
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,680
and get permanently lost.

758
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,360
It's not that I don't want
to know you, although I don't.

759
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,760
It's just that I'm afraid
we're not really the sort of people...

760
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,520
that you can afford
to be associated with.

761
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,400
Don't speak.
Just go.

762
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,440
You see that boy?
The tall one?

763
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,240
If he'd played his cards right,
you'd never even have met me.

764
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,920
But he fell for some girl
from Pomona.

765
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,200
- That'll teach him.
- Mom!

766
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,880
Do you know what Hilary was doing?
She was being an absolute bitch.

767
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,600
She was. I almost wish you'd fire her.
I really do.

768
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,040
Joey, how can you be so hard?

769
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,640
She has a really quite ruthless streak.
You ought to be warned about it.

770
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,640
She gets it
from her father.

771
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,640
They need all the help
you can give them...

772
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,240
because they're going to have
special difficulties.

773
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,760
No, don't budge.
Please, sit.

774
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Of course, they know all that.

775
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,960
They're serious people.
Fine, intelligent people.

776
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
And if they know
what lies in store for them...

777
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,400
and they still want each other
enough to accept it...

778
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,280
I think it's plain as anything
that they love each other very much.

779
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,200
You'll have to agree that any two people
who love each other that much...

780
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,040
deserve all the best luck
in the world.

781
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,680
I don't know.

782
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,200
I wish I didn't have the feeling
that they'll never make it...

783
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,120
that the whole thing's
impossible.

784
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,120
You feel that way, do you?

785
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,440
You're really thrashing about then.

786
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,040
That's very interesting, indeed.

787
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,840
And rather amusing, too,
to see a broken-down...

788
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,640
old phony liberal come face-to-face
with his principles.

789
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,200
Of course,
I always have believed...

790
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,040
that in that
fighting liberal facade...

791
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,800
there must be some sort
of reactionary bigot trying to get out.

792
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,840
Oh, go to hell. You and your crowd
are still preaching hell.

793
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,480
Well, I'm off.

794
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,280
As much as I'm enjoying
your discomfiture...

795
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,160
I may be able to save a few souls
before supper.

796
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,920
But, I am, as it happens,
free for dinner.

797
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,240
Please, come, 7:30.

798
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,280
The doctor's family are flying up
from Los Angeles.

799
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,640
Oh, well, in that case,
you'll actually need me.

800
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,640
Otherwise, your side
won't even outnumber the blacks.

801
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,520
Thank you, my dear.

802
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,800
Half past seven.

803
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,960
What was that the Beatles sang?

804
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,000
We can work it out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

805
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Mom did it.
Do you think it looks like him?

806
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,280
Well, it looks a little grim,
doesn't it?

807
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,640
- No, don't let me disturb you.
- Not at all.

808
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,360
I hope you don't mind, but I've wrangled
an invitation to dinner.

809
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,040
- Marvelous! I'm delighted you're coming.
- Thank you, my dear.

810
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,000
- I'm very delighted to have met you.
- My pleasure, Monsignor.

811
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,520
- See you this evening.
- Certainly.

812
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,800
You know,
you two make me feel...

813
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,000
quite extraordinarily happy.

814
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,720
I'd better tell Tillie. If you listen,
you'll hear her going through the roof.

815
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,640
I brought you
the latest bulletin.

816
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,960
Guess who's coming
to dinner now?

817
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,840
The Reverend Martin Luther King?

818
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,480
You're so close.
It's Monsignor Ryan.

819
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,640
Bake a second pie, will you?
You know how he loves your cooking.

820
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,680
Listen, is the big guest room
in order?

821
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,280
Dr. Prentice wants to have
a shower and change.

822
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,280
- He does?
- He does.

823
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,520
Well, she's 23 years old.

824
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,520
I guess she has
a right to do as she pleases.

825
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,960
Yes, but that's not the point.
The doctor said...

826
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,600
I know what the doctor said. Could we
get out of here for a few minutes?

827
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,080
- Sure.
- What are the others doing?

828
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,920
They're meeting Peter and Judith
for a drink...

829
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,880
and then they're going on
to the airport.

830
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,040
All right, come on.
Come on, will you?

831
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,080
Whatever happened to what's-his-name?
Homer?

832
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,360
That lawyer?
I thought she liked him very much.

833
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,720
Nothing happened to Homer.
Dr. Prentice just happened to Joey.

834
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,560
It was only last Christmas
she said Homer had the inside track.

835
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,000
Isn't that the place where we got
the good ice cream? Let's get some.

836
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,480
It's after 5:00.
You'll spoil...

837
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,400
A little ice cream can't hurt.

838
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,560
- Yes?
- When I had ice cream before...

839
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:08,330
I had a special kind of flavor
that I liked very much.

840
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:11,170
- But I can't remember what it was.
- I'll bring you the list.

841
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,330
No, you must know what it is.

842
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:16,610
Daiquiri Ice? Honeycomb Candy?
Cocoa Coconut? Jamoca Almond Fudge?

843
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,970
Mocha Jamoca? Peanut Butter and Jelly?
Cinnamon Banana Mint?

844
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:22,650
- Must have been some other place.
- Fresh Oregon Boysenberry Sherbet?

845
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,010
That's it.

846
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,770
I'm sure that's it. Bring me
a Fresh Oregon Boysenberry.

847
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:31,690
- Bring me a big one.
- Right.

848
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,730
- Will you have some? It's delicious.
- No. Black coffee.

849
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:38,730
One double Fresh Oregon Boysenberry
Sherbet and one black coffee. Thanks.

850
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,770
You know, Matt...

851
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,690
I think Mike was right
that Joey is lucky.

852
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,210
The work he's doing
is so important...

853
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,330
she'll be able to help him with it
and share it all with him.

854
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:58,250
The best break
any wife can have.

855
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,690
You know, for us,
it's all been great...

856
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:05,490
but do you know
what was the best time of all?

857
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,490
It was in the beginning
when everything was a struggle...

858
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:12,090
and you were working too hard
and sometimes frightened...

859
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,850
and there were times
when I felt...

860
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:19,210
that I really knew
that I was a help to you.

861
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,970
That was the very best time of all
for me.

862
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,810
- One black coffee.
- Thank you.

863
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,210
And one Fresh
Oregon Boysenberry Sherbet.

864
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,130
Thank you.

865
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,090
This is not the stuff.

866
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,450
I never had this stuff
before in my life.

867
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,970
You know, it's not bad.

868
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,570
Not bad at all.
I kinda like it.

869
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,530
Fresh Oregon Boysenberry.

870
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,330
Yes, sir.

871
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,570
Well, when I had
the ice cream before...

872
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,130
this isn't the stuff I had,
but I like it.

873
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,010
- It's very good. I like it very much.
- Okay.

874
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,970
- How do you do, Miss Binks?
- I got somethin' to say to you, boy.

875
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:30,610
Exactly what you tryin' to pull here?

876
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,330
I'm not trying to pull anything.
I was looking to find me a wife.

877
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,850
Ain't that just likely!
You wanna answer me somethin'?

878
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,490
What kinda doctor
you supposed to be anyhow?

879
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,450
Would you believe horse?

880
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,290
You make with witticisms
and all, huh?

881
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:48,170
Let me tell you somethin'.

882
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,250
You may think you're foolin'
Miss Joey and her folks.

883
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,410
But you ain't foolin' me for a minute.
I see what you are.

884
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,250
You're one of those smooth-talkin',
smart-ass niggers...

885
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:58,210
just out for all you can get,
with your black power...

886
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,130
and all that other
trouble-makin' nonsense.

887
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:03,210
And you listen here. I brought up that
child from a baby in her cradle...

888
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,730
and ain't nobody gonna harm her none
while I'm here watchin'.

889
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,930
And as long as you are anywhere around
this house, I'm right here watchin'.

890
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:11,370
You read me, boy?
You bring any trouble in here...

891
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,450
and you just like to find out
what black power really means!

892
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,730
And furthermore to that,
you ain't all that good-lookin'!

893
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,490
That was very good.

894
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,090
If I come in again, remind me about
the Oregon Boysenberry, will you?

895
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,170
Yeah, I sure will.
Thank you, sir.

896
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,810
Should we take home
a couple of quarts for dessert?

897
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,730
No, Tillie's baked some pies.

898
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,290
You stupid idiot!

899
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,050
Why can't you
look where you're going?

900
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:01,290
Sorry, son,
but your car is so low...

901
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,330
Of course you didn't see me!

902
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,410
You weren't even looking
where you were going!

903
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,730
Look what you did to my car!

904
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:09,450
It's my fault.
My insurance...

905
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,130
Yeah, yeah. Who cares
about your lousy insurance?

906
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,090
I worked over three months on that!

907
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,090
How much will it cost
to have it repaired?

908
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:19,530
Look at it! Thirty or forty bucks
it'll cost. Did you see it?

909
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,690
Stupid old man.
He oughtn't be allowed out.

910
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,090
He ought to be put away someplace
in a home or something.

911
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,770
There's fifty bucks! Don't bother
to have it fixed. Buy a new one!

912
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,610
Some of these old guys,
they're senile!

913
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,370
Stupid old man.

914
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,010
There oughta be a law!

915
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:49,250
What the hell is it today?

916
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,290
Less than 12'/. Of the people
in this city are colored people.

917
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:55,210
I can't even have a dish
of Oregon "Boosenberry"...

918
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,130
without runnin' into one of them.

919
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,610
You've

920
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,330
Got to

921
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:06,610
Give a little

922
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,250
Take a little

923
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,770
And let your poor heart

924
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,490
Break a little

925
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,210
That's the story of

926
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,890
That's the glory of love

927
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:27,650
You've gotta laugh a little

928
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,210
Cry a little

929
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,410
Before the clouds

930
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:35,890
Roll by a little

931
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,370
That's the story of

932
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:40,250
I can't tell you
how happy I am for you.

933
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,010
And the whole thing having
happened so quickly.

934
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,130
You remember what it was
with Peter and me.

935
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:47,090
It took us three years
to decide to get married...

936
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,810
and we'd been living together
for two.

937
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,170
To John and Joey.

938
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:57,090
John and Joanna. He won't call me
anything but Joanna.

939
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,330
- I'm beginning to like it too.
- To John and Joanna.

940
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,570
Where you're so lucky
is in Joey's folks... Uh, Joanna's folks.

941
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,130
You've only just met them,
but take my word for it.

942
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,690
Matt Drayton really stands
for something in this town.

943
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:13,490
Yes. I know the Guardian's
always been a very good paper.

944
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:16,010
It's a great paper,
and he made it what it is.

945
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:20,210
There's never been a public issue on
which Matt Drayton didn't take a stand.

946
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,090
When exactly are you flying over?
Sometime next week?

947
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,970
Just as soon
as I can arrange everything.

948
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,850
Why next week? Why aren't you
flying over with John?

949
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,690
Why am I not flying over with you?

950
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,490
- Is your passport in order?
- Yes.

951
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,090
- Do you need clothes or anything?
- Nothing I couldn't get over there.

952
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:42,810
Then it seems crazy for you to be
going alone when you could go together.

953
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:46,450
- Why don't you both leave tonight?
- Why not?

954
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:03,370
It's 6:00. In an hour
they'll all be here for dinner.

955
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,530
The doctor's plane leaves
at 10:45.

956
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:10,330
No matter what it is, you're going
to have to tell them how you feel.

957
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,090
I need more than one day
to make a decision like that.

958
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,250
It's the silliest thing
I ever heard of.

959
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,770
But I'll tell you this.

960
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:20,890
I am not going to try to pretend
that I'm happy about the whole thing...

961
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:22,370
because I'm not.

962
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:25,770
And if the doctor's decision
depends upon that, then too bad.

963
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,050
And I'm thinking only
of Joey's welfare.

964
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,450
I have nothing against him personally,
but he's a grown man.

965
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:36,490
He behaved irresponsibly in the first
place by letting this thing happen.

966
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:39,250
Now he wants me to be happy
about a situation...

967
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:42,850
when I happen to know that they'll both
get their brains knocked out.

968
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,890
I'm sorry,
but that's the way I feel.

969
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,690
And I know how you're reacting.

970
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,050
You're so wrapped up in Joey's
excitement over the whole thing...

971
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:53,690
that you are not behaving
in her best interest!

972
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:23,450
Yes, Mom.

973
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:25,650
But there wasn't any reason
not to go tonight.

974
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:27,610
You can understand,
can't you, Mom?

975
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,970
My passport's in order. There's
nothing at all that I really need.

976
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,050
And it won't
take me an hour to pack.

977
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:37,330
I'll be able to be with him.
We'll be together the whole time.

978
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,370
Mom, they're here.

979
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,050
I can see them.

980
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,170
They look like awfully nice people.

981
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,170
His mother looks lovely.

982
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,370
You break it to Dad for me,
will you?

983
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:50,450
Well...

984
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:53,970
I guess I should have called you back
because there is this one thing...

985
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,490
I should have...

986
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:59,290
I've been meaning
to write to you about it.

987
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:02,130
There was one thing
I didn't explain, Dad.

988
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:04,170
And...

989
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,210
I'm afraid it's gonna be
kind of a shock.

990
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:16,130
You see what I mean?

991
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:19,890
Mom, Dad,
this is Joanna Drayton.

992
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:21,690
Joanna, my mom and dad.

993
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,650
Mrs. Prentice, I'm so happy.

994
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,530
- Miss Drayton?
- Yes.

995
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:30,690
Mr. Prentice,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

996
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:37,330
I can explain.

997
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:41,730
I can imagine what's going on
in your mind...

998
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,010
but we can explain.

999
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,490
You can?

1000
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,730
Of course we can.

1001
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:52,170
You have bags?

1002
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:55,930
Of course you have bags.
Let's go get your bags.

1003
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,850
Mama?

1004
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,930
- What did your folks say?
- All's well.

1005
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:06,290
- Did you talk to your father?
- To Mom. But she'll tell him.

1006
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:10,530
Tonight?

1007
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,810
- I thought I ought to tell you.
- That's out of the question.

1008
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,290
This whole damn thing is...
No, that's out of the question.

1009
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,410
I'll tell you something else.
I couldn't do what you're about to do...

1010
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:20,650
so I don't begin to understand
how you propose to go about it.

1011
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:23,050
But you can't break their hearts
over a drink...

1012
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,010
and expect them
to sit down to dinner.

1013
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,770
Don't you think I know that?

1014
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:30,690
I have to talk to the doctor...
I'll talk to him after dinner.

1015
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,610
Tell him exactly how I feel.

1016
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,730
I'm not trying
to give you an argument.

1017
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:39,050
There's nothing I can say
that you don't know.

1018
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:42,410
It's important that you understand
just how wrong I think you...

1019
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,890
I believe you're making the worst
mistake you've ever made in your...

1020
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,610
You're gonna regret it with more
bitterness that you've ever known...

1021
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:49,250
for as long as you live.

1022
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:52,170
You're wrong.
You're as wrong as you can be.

1023
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,530
Because I'm thinking of her
and even the doctor is going to know...

1024
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,450
I'm thinking of her.

1025
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:58,370
There's something else.

1026
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:01,490
I'm surprised
it hasn't occurred to you.

1027
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,530
The doctor will accept
whatever you say to him...

1028
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:07,690
because he's a terribly sensitive man
and because he said he would.

1029
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,490
But Joey won't. The most obvious
mistake you're making...

1030
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:13,010
is in underestimating
your own daughter.

1031
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,410
She'll fight you and
your whole attitude...

1032
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:18,250
and everything you do and every
argument you ever try to give her.

1033
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:20,890
And one thing more.

1034
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:25,450
Until today, I would never have believed
that I could say such a thing...

1035
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,570
but when she fights you...

1036
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,490
and for what it may be worth...

1037
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:31,410
I'm going to be on her side.

1038
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:39,370
I never believed I'd hear you
say a thing like that.

1039
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,970
- Can I get you another drink?
- No, thanks. I'll get it myself.

1040
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,650
I wish we had more time.

1041
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,050
What, Mom?

1042
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:02,330
I was going to ask Miss Drayton
how her father and mother reacted to...

1043
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,450
Yeah. I wanted to ask that too.

1044
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:07,650
Please call me Joanna.
They were shaken, all right.

1045
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,850
I don't think
I've ever seen them so surprised.

1046
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,770
The thing that really shook them...

1047
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,690
was that I wanted to marry anybody
they hadn't even heard about.

1048
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,610
I can't blame them
for being sort of stunned by it all.

1049
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:22,370
Well. Then you couldn't blame us if we
were a little stunned, too, could you?

1050
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:25,090
I mean, I wouldn't appear unreasonable
if I suggested...

1051
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:29,130
that the two of you were behaving like
a couple of escaped lunatics, would I?

1052
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,330
This whole thing...

1053
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:35,290
happened so quickly...

1054
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,210
it's like trying to ride a rocket.

1055
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:40,210
We didn't plan it that way.
It just happened that way.

1056
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:44,090
It's a little hard on Joanna's folks and
I'm sure it's gonna be hard on you.

1057
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,210
We've got one evening
to discuss it...

1058
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:50,210
and if you have any objections,
you'd better raise them in a hurry...

1059
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:53,490
because in exactly four hours
we're gonna be on that plane and gone.

1060
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,930
I don't think I could list
all my objections in four hours.

1061
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,170
I think I'd need
more like eight hours.

1062
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:02,530
Well, you've only got four hours.

1063
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:04,810
So you'll just have to talk
twice as fast.

1064
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,650
Hello, darling.
How are you?

1065
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,930
Forgive me.
I am a little bit early.

1066
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:27,770
Ego absolvo te.
Come in.

1067
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,330
I don't like to be
always repeating myself...

1068
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,730
but how long is it since
that I remarked that I thought...

1069
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:37,930
that you were the loveliest woman
I have ever known?

1070
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:41,450
You know, there is a kind of envy
that is no way sinful.

1071
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:44,050
That's what I've always
had for Matt all these years.

1072
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:48,610
- What can I give you to drink?
- Well, I like Scotch if...

1073
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,410
- Are we drinking wine?
- Yes.

1074
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:54,450
Oh. I'll have
a little drop of Scotch anyhow.

1075
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:57,250
Equal amount of soda, please.

1076
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:04,610
Thank you.

1077
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:09,810
My dear, what's the matter?

1078
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,250
Sorry.

1079
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:16,170
We're in trouble.

1080
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:18,890
Mike...

1081
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,090
we're in terrible trouble,
terrible trouble.

1082
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,810
John told us...
Matt and me...

1083
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:27,130
that he wouldn't marry Joey
unless we could say...

1084
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,250
that we approved the marriage
with no reservations whatever.

1085
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:32,610
Joey doesn't know
that he said that.

1086
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,770
Now she's suddenly decided to go
with him tonight. She has her tickets.

1087
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:39,330
The two of them are on their way in
from the airport with John's parents...

1088
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,970
and neither of them knows
that Matt has decided...

1089
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,010
Well.

1090
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,890
Matt has decided
that he can't approve.

1091
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:51,130
That's not true.
Please tell me it's not true.

1092
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:54,330
- Where is Matt?
- He's upstairs changing. He's...

1093
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:58,050
He's not himself.

1094
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:02,490
Excuse me.

1095
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:04,410
It's incredible!

1096
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,930
- Table all right?
- It's fine.

1097
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:20,290
- Thank you.
- Miss Christina, what's gonna happen?

1098
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,210
I don't know, Tillie.

1099
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:28,690
You and Mr. Matt, you gonna put a stop
to this damn nonsense foolishness?

1100
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,770
I don't want to put a stop
to anything.

1101
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,290
He's a fine man.

1102
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,850
He's a wonderful man,
and Joey is very much in love with him.

1103
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:42,090
And it isn't just
damn nonsense foolishness.

1104
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:44,050
Well, I tell you, Miss Christina.

1105
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:47,890
The way you are talkin',
I don't understand nothin' no more.

1106
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:53,530
Nobody understands nothin' no more.

1107
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:58,250
No, I don't think you're butting
into something that doesn't concern...

1108
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:01,810
Damn blast these lousy laundries.

1109
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:03,730
I understand how you feel.

1110
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:06,490
I understand how everybody feels.

1111
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,090
But you have to
understand something too.

1112
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,370
They've boxed me
into a hell of a corner here.

1113
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:13,810
And no matter what Christina says
or what you say...

1114
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:16,170
I am not going to behave
irresponsibly.

1115
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,770
I'm not gonna tell them they can't get
married. I don't have the right.

1116
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:21,730
But they don't have the right
to come in here...

1117
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:24,210
and expect me to be happy
about something any normal man...

1118
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:26,090
Oh, for God's sake!

1119
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,490
You're on the point of destroying
all the happiness there is...

1120
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:32,770
in one of the happiest families
I've ever known.

1121
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:34,890
Have you any appreciation
at all for Christina...

1122
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:40,130
Have you any appreciation at all
of how that woman has behaved today?

1123
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:44,290
From the moment they walked in, she was
for it, as if there were no problems.

1124
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:48,370
But there are no problems that Joey
and young Prentice don't know about.

1125
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:52,010
Christina has more respect for Joey's
judgment than you have. I must say...

1126
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:54,570
Oh, come off it!

1127
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:58,250
If Joey came home with some fuzzy-wuzzy
and said "This is the man for me"...

1128
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:01,130
Christina would say,
"Oh, really? How wonderful.

1129
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:04,770
Where will we get enough roses
to fill the Rose Bowl?"

1130
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:08,090
I'm trying to remember
where I've seen you so angry.

1131
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:11,570
Oh, yes. When you took
nine shots on the seventh green.

1132
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:15,050
Would you mind
getting the hell out of here?

1133
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:17,610
I think I know why you're angry too.

1134
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,250
Not with the doctor,
whom you obviously respect.

1135
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:23,290
Not with Joey or Christina,
not even with me.

1136
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:25,330
You're angry with yourself.

1137
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,330
You're a pontificating
old poop!

1138
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:31,650
You're angry because all of a sudden,
and in a single day, you've been thrown.

1139
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:35,210
You're the last man in the world I would
have expected to behave the way you are.

1140
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:38,010
You're not yourself.
You're off balance.

1141
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:40,290
You don't know who your are,
what you are or what you're doing.

1142
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:41,850
That's your trouble.

1143
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:45,490
You've gone back on yourself, laddie,
and in your heart you know it.

1144
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:48,610
Now, listen, there's a limit
to what I'll take, even from you.

1145
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:53,330
For 30 years, there's been no man
I've admired or respected more.

1146
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,490
You know that.

1147
01:11:55,570 --> 01:12:00,410
And for the first time in all
those 30 years, I feel sorry for you.

1148
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:02,930
Damn it, that's enough!

1149
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:06,490
Are you really capable
of putting yourself in my position?

1150
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:08,410
Unless you've got
some kids of your own...

1151
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,730
hidden away somewhere
that haven't shown up in the record...

1152
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:14,730
how can you possibly know how a father
would feel in a situation like this?

1153
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:16,210
You don't know!

1154
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:19,130
I happen to believe they wouldn't
have a dog's chance...

1155
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,330
not in this country,
not in the whole, stinking world.

1156
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:24,050
They are this country.

1157
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,890
They'll change this stinking world.

1158
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:29,770
Yeah, sure. Fifty years, maybe,
or a hundred years.

1159
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:32,650
But not in your lifetime.
Maybe not even in mine.

1160
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,050
My dear friend...

1161
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:38,130
I wish with all my heart
you could be restrained.

1162
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:40,010
And if I were ten years younger...

1163
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,450
to prevent you
from going downstairs...

1164
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,050
I believe I'd make some sort of effort
to wrestle you to the floor.

1165
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:48,250
That'll be the day.

1166
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:54,330
Is that the car?
Did you hear a car?

1167
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:01,690
Mrs. Prentice,
I'm Christina Drayton.

1168
01:13:01,730 --> 01:13:04,090
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Prentice?

1169
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,450
I'm so pleased to meet you.
Come on in.

1170
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:09,250
Let me take your coat and hat.
And yours?

1171
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:10,730
Thank you.

1172
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:13,890
How good of you to come
all this long way to see us. Do go in.

1173
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:16,570
What did Dad say? Did you tell him?
I'll bet he was shaken.

1174
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:19,490
- It was a surprise.
- Does he want to talk to me?

1175
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:23,130
Yes, I'm sure he does. Later.
Please come in.

1176
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:26,050
May I get you a drink?
What would you like?

1177
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:29,130
May I have some sherry, please?
What a lovely room.

1178
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:31,650
Thank you. John, would you be bartender?
I'll have some sherry too.

1179
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:34,130
- Of course.
- Shall we sit over here?

1180
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,210
What will you have, Dad?
Bourbon?

1181
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:40,530
- Thank you.
- You have such a magnificent view.

1182
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:43,810
Thank you. Please sit down.
Sit down, Mr. Prentice.

1183
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:51,530
Did you have a pleasant flight?

1184
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,610
Very pleasant, thank you.

1185
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:56,770
The view of the sunset
was breathtaking.

1186
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:59,770
Only took forty minutes.
Four hundred miles.

1187
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:02,450
It's incredible, isn't it?

1188
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:08,490
My husband will be down directly,
I think.

1189
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,170
He's upstairs changing.

1190
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,730
And we have a friend of ours
who's coming to dinner with us.

1191
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,490
Monsignor Ryan.

1192
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,330
I'm sure theyll be down
in a minute.

1193
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,290
- Thank you.
- Mom.

1194
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:21,370
- Thank you.
- There you are, Dad.

1195
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:23,810
Thanks, son.

1196
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:27,010
Are you Catholics?

1197
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,130
Well, no, we're not.

1198
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,210
I'm afraid we're
nothing in particular.

1199
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:36,530
Monsignor Ryan just happens to be
a very old friend.

1200
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:40,210
Do you come often
to San Francisco?

1201
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:42,530
I've got to talk to your father.

1202
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,010
There he is.

1203
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,690
Dad, I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Prentice.

1204
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:51,330
- This is my father.
- Mrs. Prentice, nice to meet you.

1205
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:54,250
- How do you do?
- Mr. Prentice, happy to meet you.

1206
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:57,010
- How do you do?
- May I present Monsignor Ryan?

1207
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:59,370
- How do you do, ma'am?
- How do you do?

1208
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:00,850
Glad to meet you, sir.

1209
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,530
- Are you and John tending bar?
- Yes.

1210
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:04,490
The monsignor and I
are both drinking Scotch.

1211
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:06,410
Coming up.

1212
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:08,330
Sit down.

1213
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:12,650
Well.

1214
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:16,810
Did you have a nice flight
from Los Angeles?

1215
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,850
Oh, yes. Very nice flight.

1216
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:20,650
Only 40 minutes.

1217
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,330
Only 40 minutes from Los Angeles.

1218
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,610
- Terrifying.
- If you're going to talk about flying...

1219
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,650
you could talk
about flying to Geneva...

1220
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:30,570
because John and I
are hoping to persuade...

1221
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:32,650
all of you to fly over
for the wedding.

1222
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:36,170
Would anybody like to talk about that
before I go up and start packing?

1223
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:42,050
I take it they've told you
all about their plans?

1224
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:45,450
Of course. It's only when you're
eloping that you keep it a secret.

1225
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:47,490
I don't know about you,
Mr. Prentice...

1226
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:51,210
but it seems to me that these two
are rushing it just a little bit.

1227
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:54,450
It seemed that way to me too.

1228
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:57,570
It seems like that to you too?

1229
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:59,210
That's right.

1230
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,490
I'm certainly relieved
to hear that.

1231
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:05,610
I was beginning to think I was the only
one around here who had any...

1232
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:08,690
I would like Mrs. Prentice
to see the view.

1233
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,010
What the hell are you talking about?
What view?

1234
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:13,330
From the terrace.
Before it gets too cold.

1235
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:16,610
- Would you care to see the view?
- Oh, yes, thank you. I would.

1236
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,130
Good. Excuse us.
Bring your drink with you.

1237
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:31,890
Have you had any chance
to speak privately with John?

1238
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:33,530
Well, no.

1239
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:36,170
Because it's important that
you understand what's happened here...

1240
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,770
and what I'm terribly afraid
is going to happen.

1241
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:44,410
May I explain the situation to you
or try to?

1242
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,050
Yes, please.
I wish you would.

1243
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:48,370
First, I have to ask you...

1244
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:51,570
Forgive my being so abrupt
and so direct.

1245
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:55,170
Are you shocked
by the fact that John...

1246
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,370
that your son is involved
with a white girl?

1247
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,810
Surprised.

1248
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:03,410
It never happened before.

1249
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:06,490
I guess it never occurred to me
that such a thing might happen.

1250
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:10,170
But it wouldn't be true
to say that I'm shocked.

1251
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:13,130
Are you?

1252
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,450
Well.

1253
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:19,330
I think I was at first
this afternoon.

1254
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:23,610
Because it came
as a complete surprise to us too.

1255
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:25,570
But now I know
how they feel about each other.

1256
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:28,130
Joey's still very young...

1257
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,050
but she's not a child.

1258
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,370
And they're...

1259
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:35,370
deeply in love
with each other.

1260
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,090
Are you about to tell me...

1261
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:45,690
that you'd be willing to approve
the marriage but your husband won't?

1262
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:47,610
Is that it?

1263
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:50,850
Yes, that's it.

1264
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:52,770
My husband won't either.

1265
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,010
I wish there were more time...

1266
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:01,370
if only so that we could adjust
to the situation.

1267
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,730
But the way things are,
there just isn't any time.

1268
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:08,730
If we're going to accept
the thing at all, it seems to me...

1269
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:11,570
we'll have to trust
the two of them...

1270
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,890
and accept that they know
what they're doing.

1271
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:17,010
And, Mrs. Drayton...

1272
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:19,490
my husband just won't do that.

1273
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:27,850
They seem to be having
quite a conversation out there.

1274
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:33,090
It might do no harm
if we could have a few words.

1275
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,170
Yeah, sure.

1276
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:38,330
We can go in my study.
Will you excuse us, please?

1277
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,930
I'll have another drink
if you will, Doctor?

1278
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:01,010
If you'll excuse me, I'll go up
and throw a few things together.

1279
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,130
Like for the next ten years.

1280
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:13,410
Mr. Drayton...

1281
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:18,770
I don't know you at all, and
I certainly wouldn't want to offend you.

1282
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:20,690
But are you some kind of a nut?

1283
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:24,970
Are you going to tell me that you
approve of what's been going on here?

1284
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,570
- I wasn't going to tell you that at all.
- Because if you do...

1285
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:30,530
You may be a big, successful
newspaper publisher...

1286
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:32,890
and I'm nothing but
a pensioned-off mailman...

1287
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:34,970
but you are right out of your mind.

1288
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:46,090
I have a pretty good idea
of what my father is saying to him.

1289
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:50,330
But I wish I knew...

1290
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:53,290
You were talking with him upstairs.

1291
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:56,410
Have you any idea what
Mr. Drayton is saying to my father?

1292
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:00,210
I can tell you one thing.
I was very sorry to hear...

1293
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:03,410
that you intend
to withdraw from the situation...

1294
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:06,450
if you encounter any opposition.

1295
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,530
She's up there packing.

1296
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:27,730
Your mother
would like to speak to you.

1297
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:35,930
This is a mess.
Where's Joey?

1298
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:37,850
- She's upstairs, my dear.
- I'm going up.

1299
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:40,970
Everything is ready
whenever you all are ready.

1300
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:42,890
We're not ready, Tillie.

1301
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,410
Well!

1302
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:50,050
What you're saying is that you feel
practically the same as I do about this.

1303
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:52,650
That's right.
But even so...

1304
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:57,330
this is a hell of an unhappy situation
for both your son and my daughter.

1305
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:02,330
I think it would be best
if you talked to John yourself.

1306
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:14,010
I said that...

1307
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:17,010
if they didn't approve,
there'd be no marriage.

1308
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:21,930
I set the terms, Mama.

1309
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,610
They don't disapprove.

1310
01:21:24,850 --> 01:21:26,730
Only Mr. Drayton.

1311
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:28,570
Are you sure?

1312
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:31,970
She said she'd even drive
the two of you to the airport.

1313
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:40,850
I've lived with your father
for almost 40 years.

1314
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,570
God willing,
there'll be a lot more.

1315
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:46,610
And even though...

1316
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:49,970
I've only known about this situation
for one hour...

1317
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:53,370
I feel the same way
Mrs. Drayton does.

1318
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:57,930
She says Joanna
will never give you up.

1319
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,130
I guess...

1320
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:03,370
it depends upon
how much you want her.

1321
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:06,650
Want her?

1322
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:10,970
I want her, Mama.

1323
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:15,170
You know what it's been like for me
these past eight years?

1324
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:19,210
I felt like I never wanted
anybody again.

1325
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,890
But, Mama...

1326
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:26,290
these last few days with her...

1327
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:29,850
it's like I'm alive again
and it's marvelous.

1328
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:32,730
Excuse me, Doctor.

1329
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,850
Your father wants to talk to you.

1330
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:40,970
- Does he?
- He's in my study.

1331
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:02,250
I've been talking to your husband.

1332
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:05,490
He seems pretty much upset
by all this.

1333
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:07,610
I know.

1334
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,890
Your wife says you are too.

1335
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:13,450
Not upset, exactly.
It's a very difficult problem.

1336
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:17,930
For whom?
For you and my husband?

1337
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:22,530
I think you'll solve your problem,
all right.

1338
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:25,330
All you have to do is tell them
you're against them.

1339
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:26,490
That's all.

1340
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:28,410
And you'll have no problem.

1341
01:23:30,890 --> 01:23:34,010
You're not going to tell me
you're happy about this relationship?

1342
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:38,890
This is not a night
for talking about happiness.

1343
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:40,850
This is an unhappy night.

1344
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:45,730
You've been talking to Christina.
I know how she feels.

1345
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:49,930
Can you imagine for one minute that
I want to see either one of them hurt?

1346
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:55,890
No more than my husband does.

1347
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:58,610
But hurt they're going to be.

1348
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:02,210
Worse than my husband knows.

1349
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:05,810
I think worse than you know too.

1350
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:10,930
I tell you he's as much
against this thing as I am.

1351
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:12,410
Maybe more!

1352
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,770
Son, you've got to listen to me.

1353
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:17,570
I'm not trying to tell you
how to live your life...

1354
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:20,450
but you've never
made a mistake like this before.

1355
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,450
You've been nothin'
but a source of pride...

1356
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,610
for me and your mother
your whole life.

1357
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:26,650
But you don't know what you're doin'.

1358
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:29,090
This affair here...
It all happened too fast.

1359
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:31,010
You said so yourself.

1360
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:33,450
But you've got to stop and think.

1361
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:35,850
Have you thought what people
would say about you?

1362
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:39,610
In 16 or 17 states you'd
be breakin' the law. You'd be criminals.

1363
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:41,570
And say they changed the law.

1364
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:44,450
That don't change
the way people feel about this thing.

1365
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:47,330
For a man who all his life never
put a wrong foot anywhere...

1366
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:48,850
you're way out of line!

1367
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:51,330
That's for me to decide, man.

1368
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:54,330
- So just shut up and let me...
- You don't say that to me!

1369
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:56,890
You haven't got the right to ever say
a thing like that to me.

1370
01:24:56,970 --> 01:24:58,970
Not after what I've been to you!

1371
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:01,130
And you know that,
and I know that.

1372
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:03,530
Yeah, I know what you are
and what you've made of yourself.

1373
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:07,250
But I worked my ass off to get the money
to buy you all the chances you had!

1374
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:11,450
You know how far
I carried that bag in 30 years?

1375
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,810
75,000 miles.

1376
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:17,130
And mowin' lawns in the dark so you
wouldn't have to be stokin' furnaces...

1377
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:19,530
and could bear down on the books.

1378
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:24,330
There were things your mother should
have had that she insisted go for you.

1379
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,410
And I don't mean fancy things.

1380
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:29,210
I mean a decent coat.
A lousy coat!

1381
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,330
And you're gonna tell me
that means nothin' to you...

1382
01:25:31,410 --> 01:25:33,250
and you could
break your mother's heart?

1383
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:40,450
What happens to men
when they grow old?

1384
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:43,770
Why do they forget everything?

1385
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:46,810
I believe...

1386
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,450
those two young people
need each other...

1387
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:53,610
like they need
the air to breathe in.

1388
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:57,090
Anybody can see that
by just looking at them.

1389
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:00,730
But you and my husband are...

1390
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:03,850
You might as well be blind men.

1391
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:06,850
You can only see
that they have a problem.

1392
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:11,770
But do you really know
what's happened to them?

1393
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:13,690
How they feel about each other?

1394
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:17,650
I believe...

1395
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:20,490
that men grow old.

1396
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:22,330
And when the...

1397
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:26,090
When sexual things no longer matter
to them, they forget it all.

1398
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:30,330
Forget what true passion is.

1399
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:35,690
If you ever felt what my son...

1400
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:40,930
feels for your daughter,
you've forgotten everything about it.

1401
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:43,170
My husband too.

1402
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,130
You knew once...

1403
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:47,050
but that was a long time ago.

1404
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:49,010
Now the two of you don't know.

1405
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:53,250
And the strange thing...

1406
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:55,290
for your wife and me...

1407
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:59,570
is that you don't even remember.

1408
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,490
If you did...

1409
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:04,810
how could you do
what you are doing?

1410
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:14,410
I don't care what your mother says.
Maybe she's gone haywire too.

1411
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:16,050
This is between you and me.

1412
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,490
That's the first thing you've said
that makes any sense...

1413
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:20,010
because that's exactly where it's at.

1414
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:22,610
- And what I mean to say is...
- You've said what you had to say.

1415
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,010
You listen to me.

1416
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:32,650
You say you don't want to tell me
how to live my life?

1417
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:34,250
What do you think
you've been doing?

1418
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:36,610
You tell me what rights I've got
or haven't got...

1419
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:38,770
and what I owe to you
for what you've done for me.

1420
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,970
Let me tell you something.

1421
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,650
I owe you nothing.

1422
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:47,970
If you carried that bag
a million miles...

1423
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:50,730
you did what you
were supposed to do...

1424
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:53,370
because you brought me
into this world...

1425
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:55,890
and from that day you owed me...

1426
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:58,410
everything you could ever do for me,
like I will owe my son...

1427
01:27:58,490 --> 01:27:59,770
if I ever have another.

1428
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:02,410
But you don't own me.

1429
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:05,690
You can't tell me when or where
I'm out of line...

1430
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:08,970
or try to get me to live my life
according to your rules.

1431
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,890
You don't even know
what I am, Dad.

1432
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:15,010
You don't know who I am,
how I feel, what I think.

1433
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:18,770
And if I tried to explain it the rest of
your life, you would never understand.

1434
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:22,690
You are 30 years older than I am.

1435
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,890
You and your whole lousy generation...

1436
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:27,850
believes the way it was for you
is the way it's got to be!

1437
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:30,850
And not until your whole generation
has lain down and died...

1438
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,930
will the deadweight of you
be off our backs!

1439
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:36,970
You understand?
You've got to get off my back.

1440
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:56,330
Dad.

1441
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:04,690
You're my father.

1442
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:07,970
I'm your son.
I love you.

1443
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:11,730
I always have
and I always will.

1444
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,770
But you think of yourself
as a colored man.

1445
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:20,250
I think of myself...

1446
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:22,170
as a man.

1447
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:30,850
Now, I've got a decision to make.

1448
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:34,050
And I've got to make it alone.

1449
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:35,970
And I gotta make it in a hurry.

1450
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:38,650
So...

1451
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:42,170
would you go out there...

1452
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:44,090
and see after my mother?

1453
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:39,610
You've just got to talk John's parents
into flying over with you.

1454
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:41,570
It would mean so much to John
to have them there...

1455
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:44,090
and I know they can afford it.

1456
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:47,290
You know, I think John's father
is gonna make it a bit rough for him.

1457
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:50,970
Did you see his expression when he
walked off to have a talk with Dad?

1458
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:52,810
But isn't she lovely?

1459
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:55,210
- Don't you like her already?
- Yes, darling, I do.

1460
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,850
She's a good one.

1461
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:59,210
When John's father first saw
that I was a white girl...

1462
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:01,130
I thought he was going to faint.

1463
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:03,330
What about your father?

1464
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:06,410
Yes, that was funny, wasn't it?

1465
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:09,770
Oh, Mom, isn't this thrilling?
Aren't you just...

1466
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:11,970
Yes, darling, I am. Just.

1467
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:01,650
I should be able to say something
to you, Mrs. Prentice.

1468
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:07,130
In my trade, there are
a hundred clich phrases of comfort...

1469
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:09,890
for every human condition.

1470
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:13,450
But in the midst
of this heartbreaking distress...

1471
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:15,410
I must admit...

1472
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:17,330
I'm completely stumped.

1473
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,330
There's simply
nothing I could say.

1474
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:26,010
Mary, you've just got to understand...

1475
01:32:26,090 --> 01:32:29,050
Please, John.
The monsignor is right.

1476
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,970
Please say no more.

1477
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:54,170
I'll be a son of a bitch.

1478
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:15,530
Close the door, Mr. Drayton.

1479
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:28,210
You didn't have the guts
to tell me face-to-face, did you?

1480
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:31,970
Before you start telling me
how much guts I've got...

1481
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:35,290
I told you
I'd have something to say.

1482
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:37,210
Now I'm ready to say it.

1483
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:40,930
Are you gonna stay in here?

1484
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:59,530
You know that I'm
completely sympathetic, don't you?

1485
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:03,090
You know that I have
no reservations about anything.

1486
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:06,330
And that whatever makes you happy
is my happiness too.

1487
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:08,250
Of course I know that.

1488
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:12,490
Then listen to me, darling.

1489
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:15,050
There's something
I have to tell you...

1490
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:17,210
about this situation...

1491
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:20,130
which you don't really...

1492
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:21,330
What are you doing up there?

1493
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:24,410
Come on down here, both of you!

1494
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,090
How about your glasses?

1495
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:31,090
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

1496
01:34:33,170 --> 01:34:35,010
No, you've had
enough as it is already.

1497
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:36,850
What's going on?

1498
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:39,170
There's something I want to say
and I'd like you to sit down...

1499
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,450
see if you can keep quiet
for once in your life.

1500
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:43,490
Please, sit down, John.

1501
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:45,410
Sit down, Chris, please.

1502
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:50,610
I have a few things to say and
you might just think they're important.

1503
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:56,130
This has been a strange day. I don't
think that's putting it too strongly.

1504
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:58,850
I might even say
it's been an extraordinary day.

1505
01:35:00,130 --> 01:35:02,610
I've been out there
thinking about the day...

1506
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:04,610
and the way it has gone...

1507
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:07,570
and it seems to me that now...

1508
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:11,210
I need to make a few
personal statements.

1509
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:13,610
For a variety of reasons.

1510
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:21,690
The day began for me when I walked into
this house and Tillie said to me...

1511
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:24,210
Excuse me.

1512
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:27,890
Tillie!
This'll only take a second.

1513
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:30,530
- Everything's been ready for...
- I know.

1514
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:32,450
All right. Sit down.

1515
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,330
This is Miss Matilda Binks...

1516
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:38,690
who's been a member of this family
for 22 years...

1517
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:41,770
and who today has been
making a great deal of trouble.

1518
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:42,930
Sit down, Tillie.

1519
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:50,490
Now. The minute I walked
into this house this afternoon...

1520
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:55,570
Miss Binks said to me,
"Well, all hell's done broke loose now."

1521
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:58,090
I asked her, naturally enough,
to what she referred...

1522
01:35:58,170 --> 01:36:00,370
and she said, "You'll see."

1523
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:02,010
And I did.

1524
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:07,650
Then after some preliminary guessing
games, at which I was never very good...

1525
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:10,570
it was explained to me
by my daughter...

1526
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:12,970
that she intended to get married.

1527
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:17,410
And that her intended was a young man
whom I had never met...

1528
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:20,370
who happened to be a Negro.

1529
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:24,730
I think it's fair to say
that I responded to this news...

1530
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:27,850
in the same manner that any
normal father would respond to it...

1531
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:30,770
unless, of course, his daughter
happened to be a Negro too.

1532
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:37,130
In a word, I was flabbergasted. And
while I was still being flabbergasted...

1533
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:39,890
I was informed by my daughter...

1534
01:36:39,970 --> 01:36:41,930
a very determined young woman...

1535
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:43,970
much like her mother...

1536
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:47,290
that the marriage was on...

1537
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:50,130
no matter what her mother and I
might feel about it.

1538
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:56,970
Then the next startling development
occurred when you walked in...

1539
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:59,450
and said that unless we...
her mother and I...

1540
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:02,850
approved of the marriage,
there would be no marriage.

1541
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:04,970
You didn't!
What a funny thing to do.

1542
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:11,050
This may be the last chance
I'll ever have...

1543
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:13,210
to tell you to do anything.

1544
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:15,530
So I'm telling you
shut up.

1545
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:21,130
Now.

1546
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:25,170
It became clear that we had one
single day to make up our minds...

1547
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:28,450
as to how we felt
about this whole situation.

1548
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:29,730
So what happened?

1549
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,970
My wife, typically enough...

1550
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:33,850
decided to simply ignore...

1551
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:36,650
every practical aspect
of the situation...

1552
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:40,170
and was carried away
in some kind of romantic haze...

1553
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,850
which made her, in my view...

1554
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:45,490
totally inaccessible
to anything in the way of reason.

1555
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:52,410
Now I have not as yet referred
to His Reverence...

1556
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,850
who began by forcing his way
into the situation...

1557
01:37:55,890 --> 01:37:58,170
and then insulting my intelligence...,.

1558
01:37:58,210 --> 01:38:00,930
By mouthing 300 platitudes...

1559
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:04,410
and ending just a half hour ago
by coming to my room...

1560
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:07,850
and challenging me
to a wrestling match.

1561
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:11,370
- What time is your plane?
- 10:45.

1562
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:13,850
Right.

1563
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,970
Now, Mr. Prentice...

1564
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:18,410
clearly a most reasonable man...

1565
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:20,330
says he has no wish to offend me...

1566
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:22,530
but wants to know
if I'm some kind of a nut.

1567
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:26,250
And Mrs. Prentice says...

1568
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:29,210
that like her husband,
I'm a burnt-out old shell of a man...

1569
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:32,370
who cannot even
remember what it's like...

1570
01:38:32,450 --> 01:38:34,090
to love a woman...

1571
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:37,930
the way her son loves my daughter.

1572
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:44,650
And strange as it seems...

1573
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:49,290
that's the first statement
made to me all day...

1574
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:51,690
with which I am prepared
to take issue.

1575
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:57,170
Because I think you're wrong.

1576
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:59,570
You're as wrong as you can be.

1577
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:04,370
I admit that I hadn't considered it,
hadn't even thought about it...

1578
01:39:04,410 --> 01:39:07,930
but I know exactly
how he feels about her.

1579
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:11,570
And there is nothing,
absolutely nothing...

1580
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:14,930
that your son feels
for my daughter...

1581
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:17,210
that I didn't feel for Christina.

1582
01:39:19,730 --> 01:39:21,690
Old? Yes.

1583
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:23,650
Burnt out? Certainly.

1584
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:27,930
But I can tell you
the memories are still there...

1585
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:32,770
clear, intact, indestructible.

1586
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:36,810
And they'll be there
if I live to be 110.

1587
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:39,450
Where John
made his mistake, I think...

1588
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:43,090
was attaching so much importance
to what her mother and I might think.

1589
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:48,050
Because in the final analysis,
it doesn't matter a damn what we think.

1590
01:39:48,130 --> 01:39:51,290
The only thing that matters
is what they feel...

1591
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:53,930
and how much they feel...

1592
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:55,850
for each other.

1593
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:01,570
And if it's half...

1594
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:03,490
of what we felt...

1595
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:08,970
that's everything.

1596
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,810
As for you two and
the problems you're going to have...

1597
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:28,250
they seem almost unimaginable.

1598
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:30,450
But you'll have no problem with me.

1599
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:33,290
And I think...

1600
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:36,050
that when Christina and I
and your mother...

1601
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,050
have some time to work on him...

1602
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:40,330
you'll have no problem
with your father.

1603
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:47,210
But you do know...
I'm sure you know...

1604
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,570
what you're up against.

1605
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:52,930
There'll be a hundred million people
right here in this country...

1606
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:55,090
who'll be shocked and offended...

1607
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,690
and appalled at the two of you.

1608
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:02,890
And the two of you will just
have to ride that out.

1609
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:05,490
Maybe every day
for the rest of your lives.

1610
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:10,570
You can try to ignore those people...

1611
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:13,650
or you can feel sorry for them
and for their prejudices...

1612
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:18,690
and their bigotry and
their blind hatreds and stupid fears.

1613
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:20,610
But where necessary...

1614
01:41:20,690 --> 01:41:24,210
you'll just have
to cling tight to each other...

1615
01:41:24,290 --> 01:41:27,170
and say screw all those people!

1616
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:32,650
Anybody could make a hell of a
good case against your getting married.

1617
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:36,570
The arguments are so obvious
that nobody has to make them.

1618
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:39,850
But you're two wonderful people...

1619
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:43,570
who happened to fall in love...

1620
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:48,010
and happen to have
a pigmentation problem.

1621
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:51,210
And I think that now...

1622
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:53,450
no matter what kind of a case
some bastard could make...

1623
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:55,370
against your getting married...

1624
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:57,290
there would be only one thing worse.

1625
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:01,170
And that would be if...

1626
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,410
knowing what you two are...

1627
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:05,570
knowing what you two have...

1628
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:08,730
and knowing what you two feel...

1629
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:10,930
you didn't get married.

1630
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:33,530
Well, Tillie, when the hell
are we gonna get some dinner?
