3
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,961
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:31,841
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,429
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,975
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7

8
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:48,525

with another boyfriend.

9

They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,658
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,870
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,208
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:12,006
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14

held together by wire.

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,735

19

24

to three years in prison,

25

You never wanted my friendship.

40

You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

45

You didn't need a friend like me.

46
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,523
But now you come to me and say,

47
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,067
" Don Corleone, give me justice. "

48
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,780
But you don't ask with respect.

49
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:27,577
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

50
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:36,210
You come on my daughter's wedding

00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,184
You never said
you knew Johnny Fontane!

175
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,313
-Sure. You want to meet him?
-Great! Sure.

176
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,234
-My father helped him with his career.
-He did?

177
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,402
How?

00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,276
Please, Michael. Tell me.

182
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:02,826
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

183
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,829
with a big bandleader.

184
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:10,125
And as his career got better and better ,
he wanted to get out of it.

185
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,879
Johnny is my father's godson.

186
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,299
My father went to see this bandleader.

187
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:21,303
He offered him $ 10 ,000
to let Johnny go,

188
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,139
but the bandleader said no.

189
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:29,603
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

190
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,607
Within an hour ,

191
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,154
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1 ,000.

192
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:45,160
-How did he do that?
-Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

193
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:51,708
-What was that?
-Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

194
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:57,005
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

195
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,679
That's a true story.

My voice is weak. It's weak.

it puts me right back on top again.

To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

This favor I can't give him.

We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

302
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:35,768
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her , to make her a big star.

man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

305

She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

306
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,911
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

And she runs off.

00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,382
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

310
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:11,638
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

I need a million dollars in cash.

345

in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

-30%.

347
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,774
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

348
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,818
And then it would go up.

Why do I deserve this generosity?

And I'll give you my reason.

362

It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

363
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,520
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

364
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:58,234

but drugs is a dirty business.

02:00:10,119 --> 02:00:12,288
But you needed a drink first.

1005
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:15,875
Yeah.

1006
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:21,672
Well, now you've had your drink.

1007
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:31,140
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1008
02:00:48,157 --> 02:00:50,701
I want no inquiries made.

1009
02:00:55,164 --> 02:00:57,708
I want no acts of vengeance.

1010
02:00:59,418 --> 02:01:02,255
I want you to arrange a meeting

1011
02:01:03,256 --> 02:01:05,883
with the heads of the five families.

1012

This war stops now.

1013
02:01:31,867 --> 02:01:34,370
Call Bonasera.

1014
02:01:34,495 --> 02:01:36,664
I need him now.

1015
02:01:49,051 --> 02:01:54,181
This is Tom Hagen.  calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

1016
02:01:54,265 --> 02:01:56,684
You owe your Don a service.

<i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>

1018
02:02:00,438 --> 02:02:04,734
<i>He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>

1019
02:02:25,921 --> 02:02:30,718
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

1020
02:02:30,801 --> 02:02:33,929
Yes. What do you want me to do?

1021
02:02:42,271 --> 02:02:46,776
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

1022
02:02:50,946 --> 02:02:53,824
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1023
02:03:09,924 --> 02:03:12,968
Look how they massacred my boy.

This place has become
too dangerous for you.

1037

I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

No, take her to her father's house

VITO: Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

1058
02:06:53,022 --> 02:06:57,860
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

1059
02:06:59,653 --> 02:07:02,781
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

1060
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:06,160
and from Brooklyn

1061
02:07:07,828 --> 02:07:09,872
Philip Tattaglia.

1062
02:07:11,665 --> 02:07:14,376
And from Staten Island

1063
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:17,963
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1064
02:07:18,047 --> 02:07:23,677
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

1065
02:07:23,802 --> 02:07:27,514
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

1066
02:07:34,355 --> 02:07:37,816
How did things ever get so far?

1067
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,526
I don't know.

1068
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:45,074
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

1069
02:07:48,202 --> 02:07:51,664
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

1070
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:57,503
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

1071
02:07:57,586 --> 02:08:01,590
then  willing to let things go on
as before.

1072
02:08:06,762 --> 02:08:12,184
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

1073
02:08:12,267 --> 02:08:16,355
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

1074
02:08:16,438 --> 02:08:20,609
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

1075
02:08:20,734 --> 02:08:23,612
He refused to share them.

1076
02:08:23,696 --> 02:08:27,449
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1077
02:08:27,574 --> 02:08:29,910
All of you know me.

1078
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:36,041
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

1079
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:43,549
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

1080
02:08:43,632 --> 02:08:47,886
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

1081
02:08:47,970 --> 02:08:53,934
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

1082
02:08:54,059 --> 02:08:58,731
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

1083
02:08:58,814 --> 02:09:03,068
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1084
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:08,240
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

1085
02:09:08,323 --> 02:09:10,534
Times have changed.

1086
02:09:10,659 --> 02:09:15,414
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

1087
02:09:15,497 --> 02:09:18,333
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1088
02:09:18,459 --> 02:09:23,839
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

1089
02:09:23,964 --> 02:09:28,510
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

1090
02:09:29,595 --> 02:09:33,182
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

1091
02:09:33,307 --> 02:09:35,851
After all, we're not communists.

1092
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:42,065
I also don't believe in drugs.

1093
02:09:42,191 --> 02:09:47,029
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

1094
02:09:47,154 --> 02:09:50,282
Somebody says to them
" I have powders. "

1095
02:09:50,365 --> 02:09:53,869
" If you put up
3 -4,000 dollar investment,

1096
02:09:53,994 --> 02:09:56,455
we can make 50 ,000 distributing. "

1097
02:09:57,873 --> 02:10:03,879
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

1098
02:10:03,962 --> 02:10:08,717
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

1099
02:10:08,842 --> 02:10:10,636
<i>That's an infàmia.</i>

1100
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:15,891
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

1101
02:10:15,974 --> 02:10:19,144
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

1102
02:10:25,734 --> 02:10:29,363
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1103
02:10:30,739 --> 02:10:37,412
And  willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

1104
02:10:37,996 --> 02:10:42,501
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1105
02:10:42,584 --> 02:10:46,922
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

1106
02:10:47,047 --> 02:10:50,759
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1107
02:10:50,884 --> 02:10:54,179
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger ,

1108
02:10:54,263 --> 02:10:56,849
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

1109
02:10:56,932 --> 02:11:02,104
BARZINI : We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1110
02:11:02,229 --> 02:11:05,107
You talk about vengeance.

1111
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:08,443
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

1112
02:11:08,527 --> 02:11:11,029
Or my boy to me?

1113
02:11:11,113 --> 02:11:13,907
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1114
02:11:16,702 --> 02:11:19,037
But I have selfish reasons.

1115
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:24,877
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

1116
02:11:26,753 --> 02:11:29,298
because of this Sollozzo business.

1117
02:11:30,883 --> 02:11:34,720
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1118
02:11:34,803 --> 02:11:37,472
Cleared of all these false charges.

1119
02:11:38,932 --> 02:11:42,102
But  a superstitious man.

1120
02:11:42,227 --> 02:11:47,482
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer¤,

1121
02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:52,487
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

1122
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:55,407
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1123
02:11:56,658 --> 02:12:00,287
then  going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1124
02:12:01,955 --> 02:12:04,291
And that I do not forgive.

1125
02:12:06,752 --> 02:12:09,129
But, that aside

1126
02:12:12,174 --> 02:12:14,593
let me say that I swear

1127
02:12:16,178 --> 02:12:19,306
on the souls of my grandchildren,

1128
02:12:19,431 --> 02:12:23,769
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1129
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:54,758
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1130
02:12:54,841 --> 02:12:56,927
Mention it. Don't insist.

1131
02:12:58,929 --> 02:13:03,850
-Barzini will know without being told.
-You mean Tattaglia.

1132
02:13:05,477 --> 02:13:07,437
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1133
02:13:08,522 --> 02:13:11,650
He could never have outfought Santino.

1134
02:13:14,027 --> 02:13:19,616
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1135
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:37,175
Come on, Nancy.

1136
02:13:38,385 --> 02:13:40,971
Keep together , everyone. Brian.

1137
02:13:42,305 --> 02:13:43,974
Okay, all right.

1138
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:59,239
How long have you been back?

1139
02:14:00,032 --> 02:14:01,867
I've been back a year.

1140
02:14:03,285 --> 02:14:05,412
Longer than that, I think.

1141
02:14:08,248 --> 02:14:10,417
It's good to see you, Kay.

1142
02:14:21,428 --> 02:14:23,972
working for my father now, Kay.

1143
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:29,478
He's been sick. Very sick.

1144
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:32,981
But you're not like him.

1145
02:14:33,065 --> 02:14:36,860
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1146
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:43,116
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1147
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:46,703
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1148
02:14:47,871 --> 02:14:50,332
Like a senator or president.

1149
02:14:50,415 --> 02:14:52,876
-How naive you sound.
-Why?

1150
02:14:52,959 --> 02:14:55,754
They don't have men killed.

1151
02:14:58,965 --> 02:15:00,967
Who's being naive, Kay?

1152
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:06,515
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1153
02:15:08,058 --> 02:15:12,437
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1154
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:18,235
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1155
02:15:19,653 --> 02:15:22,781
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1156
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:28,954
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1157
02:15:29,037 --> 02:15:32,541
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1158
02:15:32,624 --> 02:15:36,461
-Please stop it, Michael.
-Because... I want you to marry me.

1159
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:40,757
-It's too late.
-Please, Kay...

1160
02:15:42,467 --> 02:15:46,388
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1161
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:52,477
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1162
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:57,274
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1163
02:15:58,859 --> 02:16:01,570
That we have children. Our children.

1164
02:16:03,071 --> 02:16:05,240
Kay, I need you.

1165
02:16:07,200 --> 02:16:08,785
And I love you.

1166
02:16:30,891 --> 02:16:34,686
TESSIO: Barzini's people chisel
my territory and we do nothing about it!

1167
02:16:34,811 --> 02:16:38,440
-Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
-M ICHAEL: Be patient.

1168
02:16:38,523 --> 02:16:41,651
TESSIO:  not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1169

CARLO: We must protect ourselves.

-Let me recruit some new men.
-M ICHAEL: No.

1171
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:52,370
-Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
-TESSIO: Mike, you're wrong.

CLEMENZA: Don Corleone...

1173
02:16:56,166 --> 02:17:00,253
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1174
02:17:00,337 --> 02:17:04,382
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1175
02:17:05,383 --> 02:17:08,094
Michael is now head of the family.

1176
02:17:08,178 --> 02:17:12,432
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1177
02:17:12,515 --> 02:17:14,935
After we make the move to Nevada

1178
02:17:15,018 --> 02:17:19,397
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1179
02:17:19,481 --> 02:17:23,818
-TESSIO: How long will that be?
-Six months.

1180
02:17:23,902 --> 02:17:27,155
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1181
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:30,075
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1182
02:17:30,158 --> 02:17:35,830
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1183
02:17:35,914 --> 02:17:38,833
-Do you have faith in my judgment?
-Yes.

1184
02:17:38,917 --> 02:17:41,836
-Do I have your loyalty?
-Always, Godfather.

1185
02:17:41,962 --> 02:17:45,215
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

When we make our move there,
you'll be my right -hand man.

Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1192
02:18:12,325 --> 02:18:17,038
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1193
02:18:37,058 --> 02:18:40,895
-Thank you, Papa.
- happy for you, Carlo.

1198
02:18:59,205 --> 02:19:04,377
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:08,590
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1201

But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

and settling here.

Moe will sell us his share of the casino

Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.
