1
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,414
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

2
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,058
He's an actor.

3
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,893
We're very popular with actors.

4
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,130
Have I seen you in anything?

5
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,018
I did Hamlet a while back, didn't I?

6
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,056
And then we did The Sandpiper.

7
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,655
He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves An Albatross

8
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,696
and a lot of TV commercials.

9
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,819
- That's where the money is.
- And the artistic thrills, too.

10
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,697
Seven, Diego.

11
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,898
The apartments have been broken
into fours, fives and six es.

12
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,370
Seven-E is a four,
originally the back part of a 10.

13
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,418
The original dining room
is its living room,

14
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,858
and two servants' rooms together
are a dining room or second bedroom.

15
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,612
Do you have children?

16
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,691
We plan to.

17
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,376
We must oil that gate, Diego.

18
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,052
This way, please.

19
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,249
The previous tenant,
Mrs Gardenia, died a few days ago,

20
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,695
so nothing has been moved yet.

21
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,455
The furniture could be had
practically for asking.

22
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,259
Did she die in the apartment?

23
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,217
Oh, no, no, no. In a hospital.

24
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,689
She' d been in a coma for weeks.

25
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,533
- After you, please.
- Thank you.

26
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,851
She was very old
and passed away without waking.

27
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,219
I' d be grateful to go that way
myself when the time comes.

28
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,497
Oh, no, no, no.
Not in the apartment, no.

29
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,696
She was chipper right to the end.

30
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,613
One of the first women
lawyers in New York.

31
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,249
- Did a little gardening, too.
- She was quite a woman.

32
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,015
Oh, closet. Plenty of closets.

33
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,216
A nice view of the park.

34
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,734
- Very nice view.
- Yeah.

35
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,493
This room would make
a lovely nursery.

36
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,095
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper
would brighten it.

37
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,297
- What are all these things?
- Herbs, mostly.

38
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,257
Nice large bathroom.

39
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,094
- Mint, basil.
- Yeah. No marijuana?

40
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,377
The master bedroom.

41
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,577
- Oh, yes.
- Back at the hallway again.

42
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,013
There.

43
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,250
- Oh... Oh, Guy!
- Yeah.

44
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,093
- Ohh!
- The fireplace works, of course.

45
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,614
- Great.
- Oh!

46
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,453
It's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!

47
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,373
She's trying to get you
to lower the rent.

48
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,974
We' d raise it if we were allowed.

49
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,654
Apartments with this kind of charm...

50
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,008
Why, that's odd.

51
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,689
There's a closet
behind that secretary.

52
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,578
I'm sure there is.

53
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,493
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.

54
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,897
She moved it. It used to be there.

55
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,293
Give me a hand, will you?

56
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,817
I see now why she went into a coma.

57
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,052
She couldn't have lifted it
by herself. She was 89.

58
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,893
Should we open it?
Maybe her son should.

59
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,455
I'm authorised to show the apartment.

60
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,532
- Well!
- Whatever she locked in got out.

61
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,214
Perhaps she
didn't need five closets.

62
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,849
Why cover up her
vacuum cleaner and her towels?

63
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,056
I don't suppose we'll ever know.

64
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,496
Maybe she was becoming senile.
Anything else?

65
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,810
What about laundry facilities?

66
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,856
It's bigger than the other one.

67
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,818
Yeah.
It's more expensive, too, you know?

68
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,458
It's better located.

69
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,896
Yeah, I could walk to all
the theatres from here.

70
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,016
Oh, Guy, let's take it, please?

71
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,534
That living room could be...
Oh, please!

72
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,576
OK. We get out
of the other lease, OK.

73
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,252
I was tempted to write
that you were drug addicts.

74
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,855
Instead, I decided to lie
and say you were wonderful.

75
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,296
- You're great, Hutch.
- Could I talk you out of it?

76
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,213
- He's pulling your leg.
- Indeed I'm not.

77
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,779
That looks great.

78
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,490
You know the Bramford
had rather an unpleasant reputation?

79
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,335
It's where the Trench sisters
conducted their dietary experiments

80
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,775
and Keith Kennedy held his parties.

81
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,215
Adrian Marcato lived there, too...

82
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,689
- Trench sisters?
- Adrian Marcato?

83
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,138
The Trench sisters were two Victorian
ladies. They ate young children.

84
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,690
- Lovely.
- Marcato practised witchcraft.

85
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,456
He made quite a splash by announcing
he' d conjured up the living devil.

86
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,978
People attacked and nearly killed him
in the lobby of the Bramford.

87
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,129
You're joking?

88
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,691
Later, after the Keith Kennedy
business, the house was half empty.

89
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,897
I didn't know
that Marcato lived there.

90
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,017
World War II
filled the house up again.

91
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,613
Terrific.

92
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,294
- The house?
- The lamb.

93
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,371
It's called Black Bramford.

94
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,611
Awful things happen
in every apartment house.

95
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,659
This house has
a lot of unpleasant happenings.

96
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,336
In '59, a dead infant was found,
wrapped in newspaper in the basement.

97
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,059
You really rouse my appetite.

98
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,495
Have some more wine.

99
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,892
Roman!

100
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,416
Bring me in some root beer
when you come!

101
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,779
Hey, these are shelves.

102
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,056
Hey... let's make love.

103
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,457
I think I hear the
Trench sisters chewing.

104
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,899
Straight up to the left.

105
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,417
Here in Daytona, Florida,
it's the 250cc 100-mile classic

106
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,177
with Yamaha leading and winning it,
taking seven of the top 10 places.

107
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,048
It's the third straight year
for Yamaha, a clean sweep.

108
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,168
Yamaha is race-bred from champions,
with a model for all kinds of riding.

109
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,651
You should discover the swingin'
world of Yamaha. Have a ride.

110
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,891
- Come on. Get on.
- OK, come on. Let's go.

111
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,493
Look.

112
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,932
It's great.

113
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,419
I'm sorry. I thought you were
Victoria Vetri, the actress.

114
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,853
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,137
That's OK.
A lot of people think I'm Victoria.

116
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,371
- I don't see any resemblance.
- Do you know her?

117
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,813
No.

118
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,658
- My name's Terry Gionoffrio.
- Hi, I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

119
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,858
- We're new tenants.
- I'm staying with the Castevets.

120
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,896
I'm their guest, sort of.

121
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,448
Our apartment was the back of yours.

122
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,577
You took the old lady's apartment.
Mrs...?

123
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,538
- Yeah... Gardenia.
- Gardenia. Yeah.

124
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,408
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
for her to cook with.

125
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,731
- I saw them.
- Now she grows her own.

126
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,778
Ex cuse me, I have to add softener.

127
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,818
- What does your husband do?
- He's an actor.

128
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,368
- What's his name?
- Guy Woodhouse.

129
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,295
He was in Luther and Nobody Loves An
Albatross, and he does a lot of TV.

130
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,895
Gee, I watch TV all day long.
I bet I've seen him.

131
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,939
- I hate this basement.
- Yeah, me, too.

132
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,851
It gives me the creeps.

133
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,932
Let's come down
together and do our laundry.

134
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,533
That' d be great.

135
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,772
I have a good luck charm.
It might work for both of us.

136
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,575
- That's beautiful.
- Isn't it?

137
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,855
Mrs Castevet gave it to me.

138
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,377
It's supposed to be good luck.
It's got some stuff inside.

139
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,135
I'm not mad about the smell either.
I hope it works.

140
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,610
It's beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it.

141
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,852
European. The Castevets are the most
wonderful people in the world.

142
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,410
- They picked me up off the sidewalk.
- You were sick?

143
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,731
I was starving, on dope
and a lot of other things.

144
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,334
I'm like the daughter they never had.

145
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,093
At first,
I thought they wanted me for sex,

146
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,694
but they're like real grandparents.

147
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,340
I'm glad there are people like that.

148
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,698
You hear so much about apathy, people
who are afraid of getting involved.

149
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,092
I' d be dead now without them.
That's a fact. Dead or in jail.

150
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,217
You don't have any family
that could help?

151
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,972
A brother in the navy.

152
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,813
It's impossible to be 100%sure!

153
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,496
If you want my opinion, we shouldn't
tell her! That's my opinion!

154
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,536
That must be the partition.

155
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,613
That's the back part of the original
10 with a dining room,

156
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,693
and there's...a closet here,
and then there's a closet over here.

157
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,731
Stay back, huh, lady?

158
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,211
Get back, please.
There's nothing to see.

159
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,177
Get back, will you, please?

160
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,937
- Jesus.
- Get back!

161
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,818
- We know her.
- What's her name?

162
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,016
- Terry.
- Terry what?

163
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,729
Ro? What was her name again?
Terry what?

164
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,573
I don't remember.
An ltalian name.

165
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,891
She was staying with
some people named Castevet.

166
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,698
Yeah. We got that already.

167
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,773
Short and sweet. She stuck it
to the window with a Band-Aid.

168
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,693
- Come on. Get back.
- Theresa Gionoffrio.

169
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,975
Move on! Move on!

170
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,048
- You knew her?
- Only slightly.

171
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,530
- Come on, Ro, baby. Let's go.
- Oh! Here they come.

172
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,458
You folks the Castevets?

173
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,893
We are.

174
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,131
You have a Theresa Gionoffrio
living with you?

175
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,529
We do. Has there been an accident?

176
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,895
Brace yourself for some bad news.

177
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,494
She's dead. Jumped out of the window.

178
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,014
That's not possible! It's a mistake!

179
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,729
Artie, you want to let these folks
take a look, please?

180
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,056
I knew this would happen.

181
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,849
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.

182
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,091
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.

183
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,819
That doesn't mean she killed herself.

184
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,529
She was a happy girl,
no reason for self-destruction.

185
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,772
- Must've been cleaning the windows.
- At midnight?

186
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,250
- Why not? Maybe she was!
- Is that her handwriting?

187
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,370
- Yeah.
- Definitely. Absolutely.

188
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,816
I'll see this gets back to you
when we're done.

189
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,018
I don't believe it. I just
don't believe it. She was so happy.

190
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,218
- Who 's the next-of-kin?
- She didn't have anybody, only us.

191
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,133
- She had a brother.
- Did she?

192
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,530
- In the navy.
- News to me.

193
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,135
- Where is he stationed?
- I don't know.

194
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,338
She mentioned him to me in the
laundry room. I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.

195
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,376
Uh, we're in seven-E.

196
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,133
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs Castevet.

197
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,415
She seemed so happy and full of...

198
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,459
She said wonderful things about you,
how grateful she was.

199
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,689
Thank you.

200
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,453
Know anything else
about this brother?

201
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,850
- No, I don't.
- It should be easy to find him.

202
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,410
- I'm so stunned. I'm so sorry.
- It's such a pity.

203
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,331
Well, thank you.

204
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,012
Sometimes I wonder how come
you're the leader of anything.

205
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,416
Don't tell me what Laura-Louise said.

206
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,810
If you' d listened
we wouldn't have had to do this!

207
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,530
We' d have been set to go now instead
of having to start from scratch!

208
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,088
I told you
not to tell her in advance!

209
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,978
I told you
she wouldn't be open-minded!

210
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,218
I told Sister Veronica
about the windows,

211
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,053
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.

212
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,938
- Hello. How are you?
- Fine. May I come in?

213
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,738
Of course. Please do.

214
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,130
I came to thank you
for saying those nice things.

215
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,169
Poor Terry. We thought we' d failed
her, though her note said we hadn't.

216
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,219
You'll never know how helpful
it was in such a shock moment.

217
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,690
So I do thank you. Roman does, too.
Roman's my hubby.

218
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,736
I'm glad I could help.

219
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,859
Well, she was cremated yesterday.
We got to forget and go on.

220
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,250
It won't be easy.
We don't have any children. You?

221
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,490
- No.
- Well, there you have it.

222
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,254
That's nice!
Look how you put the table!

223
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,331
Now, isn't that interesting?

224
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,254
- I saw it in a magazine.
- Oh, my. Nice paint job.

225
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,898
I know.

226
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,494
That's nice. What is that?
The TV room?

227
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,652
Only temporarily.
It's going to be a nursery.

228
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,731
- You're pregnant?
- Not yet.

229
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,254
I hope to be
as soon as we're settled.

230
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,854
You're young,
you ought to have lots.

231
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,649
- We plan to have three.
- I'm dying to see the apartment.

232
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,698
- The woman before was a friend.
- Terry said.

233
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,329
Did she? You had some long talks
in the laundry room.

234
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,809
- Only one.
- Oh! Oh, my goodness!

235
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,175
It looks so much brighter.

236
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,899
What do you pay for a chair
like that?

237
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,098
Uh, oh... Um, I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.

238
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,491
- What does your hubby do?
- He's an actor.

239
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,654
I knew it! I said it to Roman
yesterday. He's so good-looking.

240
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,254
- What movies was he in?
- No movies.

241
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,653
Two plays called Luther and Nobody
Loves An Albatross, and a lot of TV.

242
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,291
Rosemary, I got a two-inch thick
sirloin steak defrosting now.

243
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,133
Why don't you and Guy
have supper with us?

244
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,609
- What do you say?
- Oh, we couldn't.

245
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,851
- Why not?
- No, really, that's very kind...

246
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,536
It would be a real help to us.
First night we'll be alone since...

247
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,771
Are you sure it wouldn't
be too much trouble?

248
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,613
Honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask.

249
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,897
All right, count on us.
I'll check with Guy.

250
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,733
You tell him
I won't take no for an answer!

251
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,449
- Here's your mail! Oh, ads.
- Thank you.

252
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,728
Donald Baumgart got that part.

253
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,416
It's a bad play.

254
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,937
Even if it folds out of town it's
the kind of part that gets noticed.

255
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,816
Mrs Castevet was here,

256
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,494
to thank me for what
I said about Terry.

257
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,856
She is the nosiest
person I've ever seen.

258
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,613
You know,
she asked the prices of things?

259
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,852
- No kidding.
- She invited us for dinner tonight.

260
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,252
I told her I' d have to check with
you, but it would probably be OK.

261
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,854
Jesus!
We don't have to, do we, honey?

262
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,692
I think they're lonely.

263
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,774
We get friendly with them
and we'll never get rid of them.

264
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,420
I told her she could count on us.

265
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,859
- You don't have to sulk about it.
- I'm not sulking.

266
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,817
I see exactly what you mean.

267
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,255
- Hell, we'll go.
- No, no. What for?

268
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,572
- We'll go!
- No. Not if you don't want to.

269
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,448
That sounds so phoney,
but I really mean it, really, I do.

270
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,779
Be my good deed for the day.

271
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,612
OK, but only if you want to.

272
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,820
And we'll make it clear that it's
just for this one night, all right?

273
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,652
Perfect timing! Come in.

274
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,892
Roman's fixing some vodka blushes.
I'm glad you could come, Guy.

275
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,290
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.

276
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,531
Dinner isn't ready just yet
but sit down there.

277
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,611
You'll be very comfortable.

278
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,294
I seem to have
overfilled the glasses.

279
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,211
No, no, no. Don't get up.

280
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,497
Generally, I pour these precise,
don't l, Minnie?

281
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,492
- Watch the carpet.
- But I've made too much,

282
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,970
and rather... Oh, there we are.
No, no. Sit down.

283
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,176
- Mrs Woodhouse...
- Thank you.

284
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,411
- Mr Woodhouse, vodka blush?
- Yes, thanks.

285
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,298
- Have you ever tasted one?
- No, I haven't.

286
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,055
- It looks delicious.
- They're popular in Australia.

287
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,291
- Now, welcome to our home!
- Hear, hear.

288
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,574
Cheers.

289
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,257
- The carpet!
- Oh, dear.

290
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,970
Brand-new carpet.
This man is so clumsy!

291
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,051
Do you come from Australia?

292
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,938
Oh, no, I'm from
right here in New York.

293
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,251
I've been there, though.
I've been everywhere.

294
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,458
You name a place and I've been there.
Go ahead, name a place.

295
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,019
Fairbanks, Alaska!

296
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,660
I've been there, all over Alaska...

297
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,856
Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,

298
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,578
Nome, Sitka, Seward.

299
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,458
- Went there in '38...
- Where are you from?

300
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,893
Well...

301
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,210
I'm from Omaha. Guy's from Baltimore.

302
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,575
They're good cities.

303
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,651
Do you travel for business?

304
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,291
Both. I'm 79, and I've been going
one place or another since I was 10.

305
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,655
I've been everywhere.

306
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,652
Steak's ready.
Don't rush your drinks.

307
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,617
Roman, take your pill!

308
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,932
No pope visits a city
where the newspapers are on strike.

309
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,296
I heard he's going to wait
till it's over.

310
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,132
That's showbiz.

311
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,896
That's exactly what it is. All the
costumes, rituals - all religions.

312
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,053
- We're offending Rosemary.
- No, no.

313
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,611
- Are you religious, my dear?
- I was brought up a Catholic.

314
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,613
- You looked uncomfortable.
- He is the Pope.

315
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,739
You don't have to respect him
because he pretends he's holy.

316
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,776
That's a good point.

317
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,420
What they spend on robes and jewels!

318
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,459
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organised religion

319
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,091
was given in Luther. Did you ever
get to play that leading part, Guy?

320
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,013
Weren't you
Albert Finney's understudy?

321
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,056
- No.
- Well, that's strange.

322
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,132
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made

323
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,415
and checking to see who you were.

324
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,210
- Um, what gesture was that?
- I'm not sure, it was a reaction...

325
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,213
Oh, I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.

326
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,531
- It was a kind of involuntary reach.
- That's it!

327
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,976
- It had a wonderful authenticity.
- Oh, come on.

328
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,450
No, I mean it.
My father was a theatrical producer.

329
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,691
My early years
were spent in the company

330
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,772
of Mrs Fiske,
Forbes-Robertson, Modjeska.

331
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,090
- Guy?
- Oh, yes, please.

332
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,890
You have an interesting inner
quality. It's in your TV work, too.

333
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,369
It should take you a long way,

334
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,657
provided that you get
those initial breaks.

335
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,129
Are you preparing for a show now?

336
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,370
Um, I'm up for a couple of parts.

337
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,658
- I can't believe you won't get them.
- I can.

338
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,493
I' d like to have
a spice garden some day.

339
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,413
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.

340
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,573
- You come from a big family?
- Three brothers and two sisters.

341
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,935
Your sisters married?

342
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,774
- They have children?
- One has two, the other has four.

343
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,569
- You'll have lots of children, too.
- We're fertile.

344
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,573
- I've got 16 nieces and nephews.
- Oh, my goodness!

345
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,815
Would you like me to wash
and you can wipe for a while?

346
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,970
Oh, no. That's fine, dear.

347
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,619
Roman, stop bending
Guy's ears with your stories.

348
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,134
He's only listening to be polite.

349
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,053
No, it's very interesting,
Mrs Castevet.

350
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,529
Minnie! I'm Minnie, he's Roman, OK?

351
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,573
OK! Terrific. Just terrific.

352
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,289
Goodbye, darling. Goodbye.
It was lovely, bless you.

353
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,372
- Minnie!
- Minnie, ya great kid, ya.

354
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,054
How about that steak?!

355
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,098
And the cake!
How did you eat two pieces?

356
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,695
Out of politeness.
That's how, out of politeness.

357
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,739
Only three dinner plates
that matched.

358
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,778
- And all that beautiful silver.
- Maybe they'll will it to us.

359
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,897
- Guess what's in their bathroom?
- A bidet.

360
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,016
- " Jokes For The John."
- No.

361
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,898
A book on a hook
right next to the toilet.

362
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,939
Roman's stories are pretty
damned interesting, though.

363
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:31,219
I'm going to go over there again
tomorrow night and hear some more.

364
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,258
- You are?
- Yeah. He asked me. Do this for me.

365
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,491
I thought we were seeing
Joan and Dick Jellico.

366
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,014
- Was that definite?
- Not definite.

367
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,931
We'll see them next week.

368
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,376
You don't have to come along
if you don't want to.

369
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,578
- You can stay here.
- Yeah, I think I will stay here.

370
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,017
He knew Henry Irving, too. I mean,
really interesting, you know?

371
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,694
Why did they take
their pictures down?

372
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,259
What do you mean?

373
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,774
Their pictures. They took them down.

374
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,169
Hooks in the wall and clean spaces.

375
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,138
- The one picture there doesn't fit.
- I didn't notice.

376
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,168
Hi, dear. This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,

377
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,173
lives up on 12.
This is Guy's wife, Rosemary.

378
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,978
Hello, Rosemary!

379
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,689
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
Could we come in?

380
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,295
- Uh, of course. Please do.
- There you are. Go ahead.

381
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,974
Look what they got. There's a light.

382
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,778
Oh, gosh!

383
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,455
- Isn't that beautiful!
- It came this morning.

384
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,850
- Are you all right, dear?
- Oh, I'm fine.

385
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,976
It's the first day of my period.

386
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,815
And you're up and around? On my
first day, I couldn't do anything!

387
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,131
Dan gave me gin through
a straw to kill the pain.

388
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,292
Girls today take things
more in their stride.

389
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,736
They're healthier than us,
thanks to vitamins.

390
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,610
- What are those things, seat covers?
- Cushions for the window seats.

391
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,258
Oh, yeah.

392
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,488
Oh, before I forget,

393
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,492
- this is for you from Roman and me.
- For me?

394
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,095
It's just a little present is all.
For moving in.

395
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,968
- There's no reason...
- It's real old, over 300 years.

396
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,738
It's lovely.

397
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,893
The green inside is tannis root.
That's for good luck.

398
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,733
It's lovely, but I...
I can't accept it.

399
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,459
You already have. Put it on.

400
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,496
You'll get used to the smell
before you know it.

401
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,252
Yeah, go on.

402
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,572
Oh, yes.

403
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,289
Were his stories
as interesting as last night?

404
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,371
Yes. Did you have a good time?

405
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,894
All right. I got a present.

406
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,659
- It was Terry's.
- No kidding? Kind of pretty, though.

407
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,729
Aren't you going to wear it?

408
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:49,133
It smells. There's stuff in it called
tannis root from her greenhouse.

409
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,370
Not too bad, though.

410
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,972
Tannis, anyone?

411
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,257
Well, if you took it
you ought to wear it.

412
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,855
Hello? Yes, this is he.

413
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,136
Oh, God, no.

414
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,652
Oh, the poor guy.

415
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,731
And they don't have
any idea what's causing it?

416
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,017
Oh, my God, that's awful.
That's just awful.

417
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,252
Yes, I would. I mean, yes, I am.

418
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,773
I hate to get it that way, but...

419
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,053
Well, you' d have to speak to my agent
about that end of it.

420
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,377
Alan Stone.

421
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,534
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
not as far as we're concerned.

422
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,372
Thank you, Mr Weiss.

423
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,573
Guy?

424
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,616
What is it?

425
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,259
Donald Baumgart... he's gone blind.

426
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,093
He woke up yesterday
and he can't see.

427
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,458
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I've got the part.

428
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,496
It's a hell of a way to get it.

429
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,216
Listen, uh...
I have to get out and walk around.

430
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,256
Yeah, I understand. Go ahead.

431
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,771
Baumgart. Donald Baumgart.

432
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,418
It's a fascinating part.
He'll be noticed.

433
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,288
He also has an offer for a lead
in a TV series, Miami Beach.

434
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,132
He's suddenly very hot.

435
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,530
Mm, now I understand
why you're so overjoyed.

436
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:17,216
Well, it's a difficult
period in his life. A challenge.

437
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,858
I see.

438
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,774
You know how actors are,
they're all a bit self-centred.

439
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,739
I'll bet even Laurence Olivier
is vain and self-centred.

440
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,930
It's a difficult part.

441
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,899
He's got to work with crutches,
and naturally he's preoccupied.

442
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,732
And he...

443
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,175
Well...preoccupied.

444
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,811
I see you had another suicide
up there at Happy House.

445
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,051
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.

446
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,133
It was the girl who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castevets.

447
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,051
I'm sure I told you that.

448
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,256
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully.

449
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,289
I've been a creep.

450
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,089
It's from worrying
if Baumgart would regain his sight.

451
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,058
Oh, you're bound to feel
two ways about it.

452
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,894
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.

453
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,335
- You haven't been.
- Yes, I have.

454
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,378
I've been tearing my
hair out over my career.

455
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,456
Let's have a baby. All right?

456
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,134
Let's have three babies,
one at a time.

457
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,610
A baby. You know,
Mama, Dada, poo-poo. You know?

458
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,736
- You mean it?
- Sure, I mean it.

459
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,051
I even figured out
the right time to start, look.

460
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,738
- You mean it, really?
- No, I'm kidding. Sure, I mean it.

461
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,290
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's sake,
don't cry.

462
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,416
Oh, no. I won't.

463
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,250
Here goes nothing.

464
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,854
- The paint! The paint!
- Good grief.

465
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,893
Nobody, but nobody
has a fire tonight.

466
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,578
Isn't it gorgeous? I hope
we have the coldest winter ever.

467
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,538
Oh, shit!

468
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,418
Hi, Guy! How are ya?

469
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,855
No, don't let her in. Not tonight.

470
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,135
Oh, that's very kind of you.

471
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,051
Are you sure you won't come in?

472
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,813
No! I don't want to bother you.

473
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,451
Good. Good.

474
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,977
Who says there's nothing to ESP?

475
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,654
We shall have dessert after all!

476
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,052
Mousse au chocolat. Or as Minnie
calls it...chocolate mouse.

477
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,938
I was afraid she' d stay all evening.

478
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,931
She just wanted us to try it.

479
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,454
Her speciality.

480
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,328
It was sweet of her, really.
We shouldn't make fun of her.

481
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,695
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

482
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,893
It's good.

483
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,218
It has an undertaste.

484
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,256
A chalky undertaste.

485
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,415
I don't get it.

486
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,979
That's silly, there is no undertaste.

487
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,812
There is.

488
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,733
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.

489
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,209
- I don't like it.
- It's delicious.

490
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,179
- Here, you have mine.
- There's always something wrong.

491
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,013
If it's going to turn
into a big thing...

492
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,853
If you can't stand it, don't eat it.

493
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,616
It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.

494
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,373
Would you turn
the record over, please?

495
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,140
There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?

496
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,451
You get two of them.
I'm sorry if I was stuffy.

497
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,178
You were.

498
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,490
It's the Pope at Yankee Stadium!

499
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,132
Christ, what a mob!

500
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,135
Everywhere the Pope has been
he's received this type of reception.

501
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,415
As one man put it this afternoon,

502
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,255
"Perhaps we are being undignified,
but this is a special day."

503
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,253
That's a great spot
for my Yamaha commercial.

504
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,538
Here's a brief summary
of today's historic happenings.

505
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,453
Pope Paul VI arrived at 9.27am...

506
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,132
What is it?

507
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,619
Dizzy...

508
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,737
No wonder. All that booze.

509
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,053
You didn't eat anything
all day before dinner, huh?

510
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,812
Nice.

511
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,051
Sleep is what you need.
A good night's sleep.

512
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,256
We have to make a baby.

513
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,252
Oh, we'll...we'll do it.

514
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,936
- Tomorrow. There's plenty of time.
- Just a nap.

515
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,690
Why are you taking them off?

516
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,294
To make you more comfortable.

517
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,929
- I am more comfortable.
- Sleep, Ro.

518
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,852
Isn't Hutch coming with us?

519
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:23,458
Catholics only, I...wish
we weren't bound by these prejudices,

520
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,496
but, unfortunately...

521
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,410
Easy, easy. You've got her too high.

522
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,298
Typhoon! Typhoon!

523
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,894
It killed 55 people in London...!

524
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,808
You better go down below, miss.

525
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,650
- She's awake. She sees.
- She don't see.

526
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,779
As long as she ate the mouse,
she can't see nor hear. Now sing.

527
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,250
I'm sorry to hear
you aren't feeling well.

528
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,410
It's only the mouse bite.

529
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,051
You' d better have your legs tied down
in case of convulsions.

530
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,415
Yes, I suppose so.

531
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,130
If it was rabid.

532
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,293
If the music bothers you
let me know and I'll stop it.

533
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,771
Oh, no, no, no. Please don't
change the program on my account.

534
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:13,490
Try to sleep.
We'll be waiting up on deck.

535
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,570
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

536
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,970
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.

537
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,416
Yes. That's why
I couldn't come to see you.

538
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,937
That's all right. We wouldn't
want you to jeopardise your health.

539
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,931
Am I forgiven, Father?

540
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,170
Oh, absolutely.

541
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,335
Hey, it's after nine.

542
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,573
- Five minutes.
- I have to be at Alan's at 10.

543
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,180
- Eat out.
- Like hell I will.

544
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,689
- What time is it?
- It's ten after nine.

545
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,095
What time did I go to sleep?

546
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,411
You didn't go to sleep.
You passed out.

547
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,449
From now on you get cocktails
or wine, not cocktails and wine, hm?

548
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,929
The dreams I had.

549
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,217
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.

550
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,530
I didn't want to miss baby night.

551
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,329
- A couple of nails were ragged.
- While I was out?

552
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,218
It was fun,
in a necrophile sort of way.

553
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,572
I dreamed someone was...raping me.

554
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,494
- I don't know, someone inhuman.
- Thanks a lot!

555
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,691
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

556
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,453
I didn't want to miss the night.

557
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:51,897
We could've done it this morning.
Last night wasn't the only time.

558
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,893
I was a little bit
loaded myself, you know?

559
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,179
- Hello! Did ya like it?
- Oh, yes.

560
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,649
I put too much cream de cocoa in it.

561
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,493
No, no.
You'll have to give me the recipe.

562
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,414
Yeah. You going shopping?
Do me a teeny favour, will ya?

563
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,094
Get me six eggs,
a small instant Sanka.

564
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,172
- Right. Bye-bye.
- Yeah. Ahh.

565
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,535
We should talk about it.

566
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,373
- What?
- The way you haven't looked at me.

567
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,214
- What? I've been looking at you.
- You haven't.

568
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,452
Why, sure, I have.
Now, what is it? What's the matter?

569
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,492
Nothing. Never mind.

570
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,731
- No, no. Don't say that. What is it?
- Nothing.

571
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,979
Look, honey, I...I know I've been
preoccupied with the part,

572
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,178
but it is important.
That doesn't mean I don't love you.

573
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,056
It was due on Friday.

574
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,770
- It was?
- Mm-hm.

575
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:29,738
It'll probably come
tonight or tomorrow.

576
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,651
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.

577
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,130
- A quarter. You're gonna lose.
- Shut up, will you?

578
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,769
You're getting me jumpy.
It's only been two days.

579
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,418
When will I know?

580
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,855
I'll call you when I get the results.

581
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,172
I like to do a general examination
just to know something more...

582
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,899
Elise Dunstan
recommended you, Doctor.

583
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,618
How is she?

584
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:56,091
- Fine. Did you deliver the boys?
- No, just the last.

585
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,933
- Universal haemoglobin.
- Yes, Doctor.

586
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,892
- We went to see The Fantasticks.
- Did you?

587
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,732
Did you enjoy it?

588
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,617
- Yeah.
- Good.

589
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,610
- Hello?
- Mrs Woodhouse?

590
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,895
- Dr Hill?
- Congratulations.

591
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,936
- Really?
- Really.

592
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:36,249
- Are you there?
- Yes, what happens now?

593
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,618
You come see me next month.
Get those pills. One a day.

594
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,012
- I'll mail you hospital forms.
- Uh, when will it be?

595
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,059
- It works out to be June 28th.
- That sounds so far away.

596
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,928
It is. One more thing,
we' d like another blood sample.

597
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,375
Oh, yes, of course. What for?

598
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,897
The nurse didn't take enough,
so would you drop by and see her?

599
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,050
But I am pregnant, aren't I?

600
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,815
Oh, yes, it's just
for blood samp... er, blood sugar.

601
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,734
- But you're pregnant.
- I'll come in on Monday.

602
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,972
- Don't forget the pills.
- No, I won't. Goodbye, Dr Hill.

603
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,296
Blood sugar?

604
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,052
What's that?

605
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,448
Oh! That's great! That's just great.

606
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,531
- Father.
- Mother.

607
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,616
Guy, Guy, listen.

608
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,453
Let's, uh, make this
a new beginning, OK?

609
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,613
A new openness with each other,
because we haven't been open.

610
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,818
That's true. I've been
so self-centred. That's the trouble.

611
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,858
You know I love you, don't you, Ro?

612
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,374
I swear to God,
I'll be as open and...

613
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,974
- It's my fault too.
- Bull, it's mine.

614
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,654
Bear with me.
I'll do better, you hear?

615
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,219
Oh, Guy.

616
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,130
- What?
- It's...

617
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,292
a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.

618
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,098
Hey...

619
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,694
- Know what I' d love to do?
- What?

620
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,578
Tell Minnie and Roman.
Oh, I know, I know. It's...

621
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,652
It's supposed to be
a deep, dark secret,

622
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,459
but I already told them
we were trying.

623
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,658
- They were so pleased.
- Tell them.

624
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,129
Back in two minutes?

625
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,412
You're pregnant.

626
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,337
Another blood sample.

627
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,615
Now, that's what I call good news.

628
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,329
- Oh, honey, congratulations.
- Thank you.

629
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,139
- Best wishes, Rosemary.
- Thank you.

630
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,609
We're more pleased than we can say.

631
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,772
We didn't have any champagne
but this will do.

632
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,055
- When are you due?
- June 28th.

633
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,052
It'll be so ex citing.
You got a good doctor?

634
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,892
Oh, yes, very good.

635
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:32,054
One of the top obstetricians is a
dear friend of ours, Abe Sapirstein.

636
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,371
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.

637
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,213
- Wasn't he on Open End?
- That's right.

638
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,134
- Ro?
- Well, what about Dr Hill?

639
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,530
Don't worry, I'll tell him something.
You know me.

640
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,090
I won't let you go to
no Dr Hill nobody ever heard of.

641
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,968
The best is what you'll have!
Where's your telephone?

642
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,699
- The bedroom.
- He's a brilliant man.

643
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,658
- Very sensitive.
- Ro, sit down, sit down.

644
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,254
- No, I'm fine.
- Abe? Minnie.

645
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:05,458
Listen, a dear friend of ours
just found out she's pregnant.

646
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,974
Yeah, I'm in her apartment right now.

647
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,016
We said you' d take care of her,

648
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,490
you wouldn't charge
your society prices neither.

649
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,970
Just a minute.
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11?

650
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,609
- All right.
- Yeah, 11's fine, Abe.

651
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,773
Uh-huh. Yeah, well, you, too.
No, no, no, no, not at all.

652
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,533
All right. Well, let's hope so.
Goodbye.

653
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:31,613
- Well, there you are.
- Thanks a million, Minnie.

654
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,012
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Just have a fine, healthy baby.

655
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,933
My,
I can't wait to tell Laura-Louise.

656
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,774
Oh. Uh, please don't
tell anyone else, not right away.

657
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,897
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.

658
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,655
- Now, to a fine, healthy baby.
- Hear, hear!

659
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:57,010
Andy. Or Susan.

660
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,095
Susan.

661
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,532
Please don't read books.

662
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,169
No pregnancy was ever
exactly like the ones in books.

663
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,093
And don't listen
to your friends, either.

664
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,978
No two pregnancies are ever alike.

665
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,609
- Dr Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
- No pills.

666
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,168
Minnie Castevet has a herbarium.

667
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,410
I'll have her make a daily drink

668
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,016
that'll be fresher, safer
and more vitamin-rich than any pills.

669
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,614
Any questions,
call me, night or day.

670
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,091
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.

671
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,011
- Here.
- What's in it?

672
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,773
Snips and snails
and puppy dogs' tails.

673
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,136
- But what if we want a girl?
- Do you?

674
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,053
It would be nice
if the first one were a boy.

675
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,892
Well, there you are.

676
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,257
No, really, what is in it?

677
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,776
- A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.
- Tannis root?

678
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,454
Some of that
along with some other things.

679
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,972
If you want to be stupid
be non-violent stupid,

680
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,609
I'm in love with no one,
especially not your fat wife.

681
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,770
I'm a hopeless cripple...

682
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,538
What's that?

683
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,895
I've been to Vidal Sassoon.

684
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,369
Don't tell me you paid for that?

685
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,249
Guy, I have a pain.

686
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,570
- Where?
- Here.

687
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,174
- Just now?
- Since Monday.

688
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,013
- A sharp pain.
- Did you see Sapirstein?

689
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,931
I'm seeing him Wednesday.

690
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,693
This is ridiculous.
Go see Sapirstein.

691
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:20,295
- Why didn't you say?
- I see him Wednesday regular.

692
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,578
A natural expansion of the pelvis.
Take some ordinary aspirin.

693
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,732
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.

694
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,778
I thought you weren't
going to read books?

695
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,057
- It was in the drugstore.
- It just worried you.

696
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,258
Throw it away, please?
The pains will be gone in two days.

697
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,938
Ectopic pregnancy!

698
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,697
I look awful.

699
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,090
What are you talking about?
You look great.

700
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,899
It's that haircut that looks awful.

701
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,417
You want the truth, honey, that's
the worst mistake you ever made.

702
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,649
- My God!
- It's Vidal Sassoon. It's very in.

703
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,812
- What's wrong with you?
- Do I look that bad?

704
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,336
Terrible! You're not on
one of those Zen diets?

705
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,376
- No.
- Then what is it?

706
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,098
Have you seen a doctor?

707
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,774
I might as well tell you.
I'm pregnant.

708
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,773
Rubbish. Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.

709
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:35,014
I don't sleep well. I have stiff
joints or something, so I get a pain.

710
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,331
- Nothing serious.
- Well, congratulations.

711
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:42,333
- You must be very happy.
- Oh, I am. We both are.

712
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,810
- Who 's your obstetrician?
- Abraham Sapirstein.

713
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,972
Oh! He delivered
two of my daughter's babies.

714
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,336
- He's one of the best.
- When did you see him last?

715
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,456
- Um, yesterday.
- And?

716
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,610
And he says it's fairly common.

717
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:02,058
- How much weight have you lost?
- Three pounds.

718
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,574
You've lost far more than that.

719
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:07,891
It's perfectly normal
to lose a little at first.

720
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,891
Later on, I'll be gaining.

721
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:14,178
Well...we must assume Dr Sapirstein
knows whereof he speaks.

722
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,216
He should. He charges enough.

723
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,929
We get bargain rates.
Our neighbours are his friends.

724
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,692
I'll go.

725
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,409
Stay where you are.
It hurts less when I move around.

726
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:30,375
- I was just talking about you.
- Favourably, I hope.

727
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,770
- Do you need anything?
- No. Thank you for asking.

728
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,136
- Is Guy home already?
- He won't be home till six.

729
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,056
A friend of ours is here.

730
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,813
Would you...would you
like to meet him?

731
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,972
- If I won't be intruding?
- No. Please come in.

732
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:00,499
Hutch, this is Roman Castevet.
Edward Hutchins.

733
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,140
- How do you do?
- Oh, how are you, sir?

734
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,371
I was just saying,
you sent me to Dr Sapirstein.

735
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,815
- Rosemary told you the news?
- Yes.

736
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,098
- She must get plenty of rest.
- I was alarmed by her appearance.

737
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:16,456
She has lost some weight,
but that's quite normal.

738
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,213
Later she'll gain, probably too much.

739
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,530
- So I gather.
- Please sit down.

740
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,818
Mrs Castevet makes a vitamin drink
for me from herbs she grows.

741
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,256
All according
to Dr Sapirstein's directions.

742
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:33,299
He's suspicious of commercially
prepared vitamin pills.

743
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,578
But they're manufactured
under every imaginable safeguard.

744
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,369
True, but pills can sit
for months on a druggist's shelf

745
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,533
- and lose their original potency.
- I hadn't thought of that.

746
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,895
I like having everything natural.

747
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:53,054
I'll bet expectant mothers chewed
tannis root before vitamin pills.

748
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:56,450
- Tannis root?
- It's one of the herbs in the drink.

749
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,735
Is it an herb? Can a root be an herb?

750
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,369
- You don't mean anise or orrisroot?
- No, tannis.

751
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,372
Look.

752
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,056
It's good luck, too.

753
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:16,410
Doesn't look like root matter,

754
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,253
more like mould
or fungus of some kind.

755
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:24,650
- Is it ever called any other name?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

756
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,335
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopaedia.

757
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:32,459
- What a pretty holder or charm.
- The Castevets gave it to me.

758
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,977
You seem to be taking better care
of Rosemary than her own parents.

759
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:41,178
We're very fond of her. And Guy.
Now ex cuse me, I'll have to go.

760
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:44,411
- My wife is waiting.
- It's nice to have met you.

761
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,493
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

762
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,255
I just noticed he has pierced ears.

763
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:57,538
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.
What's she like?

764
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,576
Nosy. Funny.

765
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,776
Guy's gotten very close to them.

766
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:06,648
I suppose they've become
sort of parent figures for him.

767
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:11,295
- And you?
- I...I don't know.

768
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:15,259
Sometimes they're too friendly.

769
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,128
Hey, what a surprise.
How are you, Hutch? Good to see you.

770
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,179
- You're the surprise. What happened?
- They had a rewrite.

771
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:27,458
- Stay where you are. Nobody move.
- Would you like some coffee?

772
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,098
Love some!

773
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:36,736
- Loot!
- Congratulations are in order.

774
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,812
- Wonderful, isn't it?
- When's the baby due?

775
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,212
June 28th. Dr Sapirstein delivered
two of Hutch's grandchildren.

776
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,052
- Really?
- Mm.

777
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,654
I met your neighbour. Roman Castevet.

778
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,334
Oh, did you?
Funny old duck, isn't he?

779
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,093
- He has pierced ears.
- You're kidding?

780
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,613
No, I saw.

781
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,739
We haven't seen you lately,
but I'm so busy and Ro 's pregnant

782
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,572
so we haven't seen anyone.

783
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,652
- Let's have dinner soon.
- You're not going?

784
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,732
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Thanks for coming.

785
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,174
This isn't mine. It must be yours.

786
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,889
Right. Have you thought about names,
or is it too soon?

787
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,689
Andrew or Douglas for a boy,
Melinda or Sarah for a girl.

788
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,419
- Sarah?
- Is there another of these?

789
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:33,098
- I don't see it, Hutch.
- No, it's not here.

790
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,139
I probably left it at the
City Centre. I'll stop back there.

791
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,530
- Let's have that dinner, shall we?
- Next week.

792
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,292
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

793
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,938
- Bye.
- Bye.

794
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:54,578
- That was a nice surprise.
- Guess what he said.

795
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,850
- What?
- I look terrible.

796
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,489
Good old Hutch.
Spreading cheer wherever he goes.

797
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:04,253
I'm going to get a paper, honey.

798
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:08,049
- He's a professional crepehanger.
- He's not.

799
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,335
Then he's a top-ranking amateur.

800
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:25,728
Hello. She's not feeling too well.

801
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,049
I think she's asleep.

802
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,619
All right.

803
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,260
Oh, she could be, yeah.

804
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,649
All right, can you hold on a minute?

805
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,655
It's Hutch. He wants to speak to you.

806
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:45,809
I told him you were resting
but he said it couldn't wait.

807
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,936
- Hutch?
- Dear, do you go out at all?

808
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,773
Well, I...I haven't
been going out, why?

809
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:03,615
Can you meet me tomorrow morning
in front of the Time-Life Building?

810
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,056
If you want me to.
What is it? Can't you tell me now?

811
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,132
I' d rather not.
We can have an early lunch.

812
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,098
- That would be nice.
- Good. 11 o ' clock?

813
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,535
OK. Oh, did you find your glove?

814
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:18,373
No.
Good night, Rosemary. Sleep well.

815
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,018
You, too. Good night.

816
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,172
- What was that?
- He wants to talk to me.

817
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:26,252
- What about?
- I don't know. He wouldn't say.

818
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,935
Those boys' adventure stories
are going to his head.

819
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,017
Where are you meeting him?

820
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,649
Uh, Time and Life Building
tomorrow at 11 o ' clock.

821
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,575
You're pregnant, I've got the yens.

822
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,369
- I'm getting an ice-cream. Want one?
- I' d love one.

823
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,451
- Vanilla?
- OK.

824
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,495
- Hi.
- I won't have my drink now.

825
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:18,414
Fine, dear. Take it later.
Buzz me when you get back, huh?

826
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,570
Pain, begone.
I will have no more of thee.

827
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:24,649
- Yes?
- Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?

828
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:28,289
- Yes. Who is this?
- My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

829
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,770
I had an appointment
with Mr Hutchins. Is he there?

830
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:35,375
- Hello?
- He was taken ill this morning.

831
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,416
- Taken ill?
- Yes.

832
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,378
He's in a coma
at St Vincent's Hospital.

833
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:46,251
That's awful. I just spoke
to him last night about 10.30.

834
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:49,093
- I spoke to him at 11.
- Who is this?

835
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:52,968
You don't know me.
I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend.

836
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:57,019
- Do they know what's causing it?
- No, they don't know yet.

837
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:02,128
He's totally unresponsive.
Oh, I'm going to the hospital now.

838
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:05,132
- Is there anything I can do?
- Not really.

839
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,217
All right, thank you.

840
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:39,858
No! This is what I call
the long arm of coincidence!

841
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,538
I said to myself,
if Rosemary's going out,

842
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:47,657
I might as well
do some Christmas shopping.

843
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:51,176
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?

844
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:55,731
Aw, darling, what's the matter?
You feel all right?

845
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,856
You poor thing.

846
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:03,411
You know what? I think we better
be going home now. What do you say?

847
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,698
- No, you have your shopping to do.
- Ah, there's two more weeks.

848
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,098
It'll stop any day now.

849
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:29,252
It's like a wire
inside me tightening.

850
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:33,811
Usually older women with less
flexible joints have this trouble.

851
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,573
- I'm not going out.
- You don't have to.

852
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,616
One minute to go!

853
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:44,258
Rosemary, meet Dr Shand.
He used to be a famous dentist.

854
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,969
- He made the chain for your charm.
- Oh, how do you do?

855
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,018
Come on, sweetie.
Put this wonderful hat on.

856
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,056
Doctor, come over here.

857
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,938
- Minnie, Minnie!
- Happy New Year.

858
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,978
- Have a good year.
- Happy New Year.

859
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,414
To 1966!

860
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,378
The year one!

861
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,095
What the hell are you doing?

862
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,458
Planning the menu. We're having
a party a week from Saturday.

863
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,612
It's for our old...
I mean, our young friends.

864
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:10,693
Minnie and Roman are not invited.
Neither is Laura-Louise.

865
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,338
Nor is Dr Sapirstein.

866
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,299
It's a very special party.
You have to be under 60 to get in.

867
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:26,377
Well...for a minute there, I didn't
think I was going to make it.

868
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,293
You'll make it.
You can be bartender.

869
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:33,612
Oh, swell. Do you really think
it's such a good idea?

870
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,260
It's the best idea
I've had in months.

871
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:39,173
Shouldn't you check
with Dr Sapirstein?

872
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,889
I'm giving a party,
not swimming the English Channel.

873
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,971
What about the pain?

874
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,654
Oh, haven't you heard?
lt'll go away in a day or two.

875
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,129
That looks interesting.

876
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,336
We're having some people over.

877
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,490
You feel up to entertaining?

878
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,936
Yes. These are old friends
that I haven't seen in a long time.

879
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:03,854
- They don't even know I'm pregnant.
- I'll give you a hand if you like.

880
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:06,613
No, thank you, Minnie,
but I can manage.

881
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,851
It's a buffet,
and we'll get a bartender, so...

882
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:11,692
I'll help take the coats.

883
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:14,772
No, really, you do too much
for me as it is.

884
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,852
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

885
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,692
Drink your drink, hon.

886
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,858
I' d rather not.
Not right this minute.

887
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,976
I'll drink it in a little while.

888
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:28,893
- It don't do to let it stand.
- No, I won't.

889
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:32,052
You go back,
I'll bring the glass back later.

890
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,017
I'll wait. Save you the walk.

891
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:38,491
No, it makes me very nervous when
people watch me cook. Now, scoot.

892
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:42,095
Don't let it stand too long,
it'll lose its vitamins.

893
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:56,008
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!

894
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,455
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

895
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:00,496
- Hey, Rosie.
- Yeah?

896
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,812
Bob and Leo got stuck at
another party but they'll be over.

897
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,811
Fine.

898
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,334
Oh, Rosie, it's a fantastic house!

899
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,498
Hi.

900
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:16,653
- It's been so long.
- You look like a piece of chalk.

901
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,970
You make him feed you, love.

902
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:26,289
- Adrian Marcato lived here.
- And the Trench sisters.

903
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,859
They ate children.

904
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,728
He doesn't just mean they ate them.
He means they ate them.

905
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:40,450
I make their first one strong
to get them happy, eh?

906
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,453
Rosie, do you feel OK?
You look tired.

907
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,815
Thanks for the understatement.

908
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,737
How do you like CC Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?

909
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:54,612
I'm not going to him.

910
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,179
You're not?

911
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,411
I've got another doctor
named Sapirstein.

912
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:03,129
- Oh, congratulations, Papa.
- Thanks. Nothing to it.

913
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:07,418
- I'll take that dip inside.
- Oh, yeah, please. See my flowers?

914
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,810
Yeah. Elise, will you give me a hand?

915
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,413
Oh, yeah, sure.

916
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:19,809
Is the other guy still blind?

917
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:24,257
Donald Baumgart? You know who he is.
The boy Zoe Piper lives with.

918
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,093
- He's writing a play.
- Is he still blind?

919
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:30,490
Yeah. He's going through hell
trying to adjust.

920
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,491
He dictates and Zoe writes.

921
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,770
Are you all right?

922
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,850
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a cramp for a minute.

923
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:49,534
- Don't cry.
- It's good for her.

924
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:54,091
Let her cry it out. It's all right,
darling. Sit down, sit down.

925
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,132
- Out, out!
- Let me in.

926
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,654
- Girls only.
- I want to see Rosemary.

927
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,129
- She's busy.
- I have to wash these...

928
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,778
Use the bathroom.

929
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,974
It hurts so much.
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.

930
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,494
When did the pain start?

931
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,777
In November.

932
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,374
- November?!
- What?

933
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:26,453
You have been in pain since November,
and he's not helping?

934
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,371
He says it's gonna stop.

935
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:32,214
- Why don't you see another doctor?
- No, he's very good.

936
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,734
He was on Open End.

937
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:37,050
He sounds like a sadistic nut.

938
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:42,373
Rosemary, pain like that is a
warning that something isn't right.

939
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:46,419
Go see Dr Hill.
Go see anybody besides that...that...

940
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,617
- That nut.
- Don't go on suffering like this.

941
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,656
I won't have an abortion.

942
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,698
Nobody's telling you to.
Just see another doctor.

943
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:06,731
The thing to do now is move.

944
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:09,254
- Guy?
- Yeah?

945
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:12,093
I'm going to Dr Hill Monday morning.

946
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,293
Dr Sapirstein
is either lying, or he's...

947
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,257
I don't know, out of his mind.

948
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:21,491
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.

949
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:24,970
- Rosemary...
- I'm not drinking Minnie's drink.

950
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:28,177
I want vitamins and pills
like everyone else.

951
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:32,253
I haven't drunk it for three days.
I've thrown it away.

952
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:35,138
- You've what?
- I've made my own drink.

953
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:38,974
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?

954
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:42,973
- And is that their hint for today?
- They're my friends...

955
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:47,611
They're not very bright bitches
who should mind their own business!

956
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,850
They said get a second opinion.

957
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:53,853
Rosemary, you know who Dr Hill is?
He's a Charlie nobody.

958
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:55,578
That's who he is!

959
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:58,936
I'm tired of hearing
how great Dr Sapirstein is.

960
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:03,855
We'll have to pay Sapirstein,
pay Hill. It's out of the question.

961
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:07,728
No, I'm not changing.
I just wanna get a second opinion.

962
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,651
I won't let you do it, Ro.

963
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:13,892
I mean, because it's, uh...
it's not fair to Sapirstein.

964
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,369
Not fair to...?

965
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:20,612
What are you talking about?
What about what's fair to me?

966
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,452
You want a second opinion?

967
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:26,249
You tell Sapirstein
and let him decide who gives it.

968
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,898
No! I want Dr Hill!

969
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:32,258
- At least have that much courtesy...
- If you won't pay, I'll...

970
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,491
Ro?

971
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:42,495
- Rosemary? What is it?
- It stopped.

972
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:48,052
- What?
- The pain stopped just like that.

973
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,017
- Stopped?
- Stopped.

974
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,778
What was in that drink you made?

975
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:03,134
- Uh...eggs, milk, sug...sugar.
- What else?

976
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,332
What else?

977
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:12,971
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake,
what else was in that drink?

978
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:16,769
It's alive! Guy, it's moving!

979
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,090
It's alive! It's all right!

980
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:22,536
- Feel. Feel.
- Oh, yeah, I felt it.

981
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:27,375
- Don't be scared. It won't bite you.
- It's wonderful. It really is.

982
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,611
I feel it kicking. It's alive!

983
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,577
It's moving!

984
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,293
I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess.

985
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,218
Watch the walls.

986
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:09,299
- Thanks, boys. Have one on the baby.
- Thank you very much.

987
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,572
What's that for?

988
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:41,811
- This is my hospital suitcase.
- Honey, you got three weeks.

989
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,818
Yes? Hello, Mrs Cardiff.

990
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,493
No.

991
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,058
Oh, my God.

992
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,731
Oh, my God.

993
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,697
Yes, of course I will.

994
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:17,137
Hutch is dead.

995
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:25,778
I feel awful. All this time,
I didn't even think of him.

996
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:48,211
Doctor. Doris, we'll see you later.

997
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:52,528
I beg your pardon. I'm Mrs Woodhouse.
I knew your father.

998
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,975
- You're Rosemary?
- I'm so sorry.

999
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:58,097
- Thank you. This is my sister.
- How do you do?

1000
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,296
- And my husband.
- How do you do?

1001
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,450
- Sorry to be late.
- Ex cuse me.

1002
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,451
- Yes?
- I'm Grace Cardiff.

1003
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,098
I was hoping to meet you.

1004
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:09,297
I was going to mail this,
but I thought you' d be here.

1005
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,336
- What is it?
- A book.

1006
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:15,936
Hutch regained consciousness
and thought it was the next morning.

1007
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,580
- You had the appointment?
- Oh, yes.

1008
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:22,812
I wasn't there, but he told the
doctor to make sure you got the book.

1009
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,652
Thank you.

1010
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:28,096
Oh, and I'm to tell you
the name is an anagram.

1011
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,933
- The name of the book?
- Apparently.

1012
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:34,171
He was delirious,
so it's hard to be sure.

1013
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,693
I heard you come in.
It wasn't very long.

1014
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,611
I was late. I couldn't get a taxi.

1015
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,056
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, you got mail already?

1016
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,937
Somebody gave it to me.

1017
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,932
Here. I'll hold it. Book?

1018
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:15,814
I know that house!
The Gilmores used to live there.

1019
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,652
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1020
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:22,131
I've been there lots of times.
Grace...that's my favourite name.

1021
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:24,176
- Yes.
- You need anything?

1022
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,216
- No, thank you.
- Take a nap.

1023
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,211
- I'm going to.
- Goodbye.

1024
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,891
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,

1025
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,574
"he was soon after
brought to New York.

1026
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:15,970
"He resided for several years
in the United St...

1027
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:19,894
"He was attacked by a mob
outside the Bram..."

1028
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:22,255
Outside, not in the lobby.

1029
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,738
There are no witches. Not really.

1030
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,531
The name is an anagram.

1031
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,050
Now, that really makes sense.

1032
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,493
Poor Hutch.

1033
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:05,732
What's with the chain?

1034
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,858
What's the matter?

1035
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,528
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1036
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,848
Oh.

1037
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,137
- Oh, thank you.
- How was the funeral?

1038
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,812
OK.

1039
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:23,131
I got the shirt
that was in the New Yorker.

1040
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:29,213
I got that shirt that
was in the New Yorker.

1041
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,656
That's nice.
Do you know who Roman really is?

1042
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:35,573
- What do you mean?
- Adrian Marcato 's son.

1043
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:37,855
- What?
- Come here.

1044
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:40,738
I want to show you something.

1045
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:44,813
Roman Castevet
is Steven Marcato rearranged.

1046
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,778
It's from Hutch.

1047
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,053
Look.

1048
01:27:56,180 --> 01:28:00,253
And look here. There he is
when he was 13. See the eyes?

1049
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,695
- Coincidence.
- In the same house?

1050
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,418
And look. Look here.

1051
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,459
"Soon after that in August, 1886,
his son Steven was born."

1052
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:16,250
1886, got it? That makes him 79 now.
No coincidence.

1053
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:26,413
No, I guess not. He's Steven Marcato,
all right. Poor old geezer.

1054
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:31,096
With a crazy father like that, no
wonder he switched his name around.

1055
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:35,059
- You don't think he's the same?
- What do you mean, a witch?

1056
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,938
Ro, are you kidding? Oh, Ro, honey.

1057
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,689
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?

1058
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,611
Honey, it's 1966.

1059
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:48,659
This was published in 1933.
There were covens in Europe.

1060
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,731
That's their name, the congregation.

1061
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:54,859
Covens in Europe, America,
Australia and one right here.

1062
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:59,013
The parties with the singing
and the flute and the chanting,

1063
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,933
- those are Sabbaths.
- Don't get ex cited.

1064
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:05,410
Read what they do.
They use blood in their rituals.

1065
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,094
And the most powerful
is baby's blood.

1066
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:11,456
- They use the flesh, too.
- For God's sakes!

1067
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:15,977
They're not entering this apartment
again or coming near the baby.

1068
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,494
They're old people with old friends!

1069
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:21,174
Dr Shand happens
to play the recorder!

1070
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:25,299
I'm not taking any chances.
We'll sublet, move out.

1071
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:28,611
We are not.
We'll talk about it later.

1072
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,851
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.

1073
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:37,579
- Just this last chapter.
- Not today.

1074
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,616
Look. Your hands are shaking.

1075
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,691
Come on. Give it to me.

1076
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:44,692
I mean it, now. Give it to me.

1077
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,136
Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

1078
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:58,178
- What was the name? Marchado?
- Marcato.

1079
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,774
He told me
his father was an importer.

1080
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:05,217
I understand how disturbed you must
be with him for a neighbour.

1081
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,497
I don't want anything to do with him.

1082
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:10,935
I can't take the slightest chance.

1083
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:13,250
Any mother would feel the same.

1084
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:18,619
Is there any chance that Minnie put
something harmful in those drinks?

1085
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,851
No, Rosemary.
I' d have seen evidence long ago.

1086
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:24,500
I won't take anything else from them.

1087
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:29,779
I can give you some pills that'll be
adequate these last few weeks.

1088
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:34,331
In a way, this may be the answer
to Minnie and Roman's problem, too.

1089
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:37,173
- What do you mean?
- Roman's very ill.

1090
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:40,969
Confidentially, he has no more
than a month or two left.

1091
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:43,779
He wanted to visit
his favourite cities.

1092
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:47,773
They didn't want to offend you
by leaving before the birth.

1093
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,657
I'm sorry to hear that.

1094
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:53,528
He' d be extremely embarrassed
if he knew you found out.

1095
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:57,090
Suppose we do this.
I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.

1096
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:58,932
I'll say I spoke to you.

1097
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:02,490
- Will they leave on Sunday?
- I'll see to it.

1098
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:09,856
Our thoughts are gonna be with you
till you're all happy and thin again,

1099
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:13,649
your sweet little boy or girl
laying safely in your arms.

1100
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:17,779
- Thanks for everything.
- Make Guy send us lots of pictures.

1101
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:19,054
Yes.

1102
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:22,177
I won't wish you luck
because you won't need it.

1103
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:24,216
You'll have a happy life.

1104
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,734
Have a good trip
and come back safely.

1105
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:31,894
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik
or Pescara or maybe Majorca.

1106
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:34,778
- We shall see, we shall see.
- Come back.

1107
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:36,771
- Bye, Minnie.
- Yeah.

1108
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:39,294
Goodbye, Roman. Bye-bye. Take care.

1109
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:43,009
- Kennedy Airport, Pan Am Building.
- Bye!

1110
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,658
Bye, Roman.

1111
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:48,419
Oh, boy.

1112
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:59,163
- Where's my book?
- Oh, I put it in the garbage.

1113
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,047
What?

1114
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:05,485
I didn't want you upsetting yourself.

1115
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:08,562
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.

1116
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:11,847
- I wasn't thinking of that.
- That's terrible.

1117
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:14,763
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.

1118
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:23,080
Watch out, lady!

1119
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:15,999
"In some cults, it was believed

1120
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,878
"that a personal possession
of the victim was necessary

1121
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:24,680
"and spells cannot be cast without
one of the victim's belongings."

1122
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:27,159
- Yeah?
- Is this Donald Baumgart?

1123
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:30,640
- That's right.
- This is Rosemary Woodhouse,

1124
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,402
Guy Woodhouse's wife.

1125
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,685
- Oh, yes.
- I want to know...

1126
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:39,480
You must be a happy lady,
living in the Bram...

1127
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:43,927
- I wanted to know how you are.
- Well, bless your heart.

1128
01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:46,763
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?

1129
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:50,729
Well, I'm splendid.
I've only broke six glasses today.

1130
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:54,686
Guy and I are both very unhappy

1131
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:58,319
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.

1132
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:04,529
Ah, what the hell.
That's the way it goes, right?

1133
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:09,762
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.

1134
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:15,004
Visit? No... Oh, you mean
the day we met for drinks?

1135
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:17,479
Yes, that's what I meant.

1136
01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:20,926
By the way,
he has something of yours, you know.

1137
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:22,762
What do you mean?

1138
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:25,603
- Don't...don't you know?
- No.

1139
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,999
Didn't you miss anything that day?

1140
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:31,878
You...you don't mean my tie, do you?

1141
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:33,323
Yes.

1142
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:36,527
Well, he's got mine,
and I've got his.

1143
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:39,886
- He can have it back.
- I'm sorry...

1144
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:43,201
Doesn't matter to me now
what colour tie I wear.

1145
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:48,569
- I thought he' d only borrowed it.
- No, no. It was a trade.

1146
01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:53,644
- Or...do you think he stole it?
- I have to hang up now.

1147
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:57,359
I just wanted to know
if there' d been any improvement.

1148
01:34:57,450 --> 01:35:00,442
No, there isn't.
It was nice of you to call.

1149
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:41,326
- You aren't in labour?
- No, but I have to see the doctor.

1150
01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:44,766
But he has to leave at five,
and there is Mrs Byron.

1151
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:47,922
- I'm sure he'll see you. Sit down.
- Thank you.

1152
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:12,848
- How is it out there?
- Oh, awful. 94.

1153
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:17,407
- See you next week.
- Yes, I will.

1154
01:36:22,650 --> 01:36:25,687
- You're due any day, aren't you?
- Tuesday.

1155
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:28,523
Smart to get it over with
before August.

1156
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:33,320
Mrs Byron? He'll see you right after.

1157
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:36,607
Well, let's see, um...July the 10th?

1158
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:38,840
- What time?
- Four o ' clock?

1159
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:41,319
- Fine.
- All right. See you then.

1160
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:45,608
- Thank you. Bye-bye. Good luck.
- Thank you.

1161
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:55,128
That smells nice. What is it?

1162
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:59,563
Oh, my... It's called Detchema.

1163
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:03,768
It's better than your regular,
if you don't mind my saying.

1164
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:07,445
That was a good luck charm.
I threw it away.

1165
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:10,886
Good. Maybe the doctor
will follow your example.

1166
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:18,803
- Dr Sapirstein?
- Yes. The aftershave.

1167
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:22,849
Well, it isn't, is it? I don't think
he has a good luck charm.

1168
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:25,922
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while.

1169
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:30,242
And when he does... Oh, boy.
Haven't you ever noticed?

1170
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:31,809
No.

1171
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:35,405
Maybe you thought it was your own
you were smelling.

1172
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:37,446
What is it, a chemical thing?

1173
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:42,206
Will you ex cuse me a moment, please?
My husband is waiting outside.

1174
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:45,123
I have to go and tell him something.
I'll be back in a minute.

1175
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:34,681
- Dr Hill's office.
- Dr Hill, please.

1176
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:38,160
Would you like to leave a message?

1177
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:42,243
Um, yes.
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.

1178
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:47,358
Woodhouse. Would you ask him to
call me back right away, please?

1179
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:52,444
Uh...my number is 475-2598.

1180
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:55,203
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.

1181
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:56,643
All right.

1182
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:08,688
Quickly, please, Dr Hill, call me.

1183
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:18,806
Oh, oh, really?
Did he really say that?

1184
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:21,120
Oh, he didn't say that?

1185
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:23,963
What else was it that he said?

1186
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:27,759
Oh, that's wonderful.
That's wonder... That's marvellous.

1187
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:29,761
Yes. Dr Hill?

1188
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:33,081
- Rosemary Woodhouse?
- Yes.

1189
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:36,128
- Are you Dr Hill's patient?
- No.

1190
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:39,327
Um, yes, I mean,
well, I've seen him once.

1191
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:43,198
Um, please tell him he has
to speak to me. It's important.

1192
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:45,963
- Tell him to call me, hm?
- All right.

1193
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:47,403
Thank you.

1194
01:39:54,370 --> 01:39:57,203
All of them. All of them.

1195
01:39:57,290 --> 01:40:00,088
All in it together. All of them.

1196
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:02,365
All of them witches.

1197
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:04,884
Don't worry, little Andy or Jenny,

1198
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:07,803
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.

1199
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:12,880
Yes. Dr...

1200
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:14,881
- Mrs Woodhouse?
- Yes!

1201
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:17,643
Oh, thank you,
thank you for calling me.

1202
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:20,085
I thought you were in California.

1203
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:25,039
No. No, l-I've been to another
doctor, and he isn't good, Dr Hill.

1204
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:30,079
He's been lying to me and giving me
unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.

1205
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:34,049
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me June 28th?

1206
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:37,520
- I want you to deliver it.
- Mrs Woodhouse...

1207
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:42,286
Please, let me talk to you.
Let me explain what's been going on.

1208
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:46,522
I can't stay too long here.
They'll be coming, looking for me.

1209
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:51,320
Dr Hill? Dr Hill, there's a plot...
I know that sounds crazy.

1210
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:55,039
You're probably thinking,
"This girl has flipped,"

1211
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:59,248
but I haven't flipped,
Dr Hill, I swear, by all the saints.

1212
01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:02,481
There are plots against people,
aren't there?

1213
01:41:02,570 --> 01:41:07,280
- I suppose there are.
- There's one against me and my baby.

1214
01:41:07,370 --> 01:41:12,285
- Come see me tomorrow after five.
- Now! Right now.

1215
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:17,000
Mrs Woodhouse, I'm home. I've
been up since yesterday morning...

1216
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:19,684
I beg you. I beg you.

1217
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:23,040
I can't stay here.

1218
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:26,842
- My office at eight o ' clock.
- Thank you!

1219
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:28,886
- Oh, wait! Dr Hill?
- Yes?

1220
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:33,043
- My husband may call you...
- I'm not gonna speak to anyone.

1221
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:35,963
- I'm gonna take a nap.
- Thank you.

1222
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:09,521
Keep the change.

1223
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:11,362
Uh, driver, please,

1224
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:15,409
could you wait and watch until...
until I'm inside the door?

1225
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:34,322
He lied.
He said we were going to Hollywood.

1226
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:36,844
The worst thing is he's involved.

1227
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:39,763
He sleeps in pyjamas now.
He never used to.

1228
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:41,761
He's probably hiding a mark.

1229
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:45,729
They give you marks when you join...
all sorts of rituals.

1230
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:49,485
They hold Sabbaths there.
You could hear them.

1231
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:52,482
Guy, my husband,
said it was Dr Shand,

1232
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:54,720
one of them playing a recorder.

1233
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:59,326
Now, how did he know it was Dr Shand
unless he was there with them?

1234
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:01,560
Um, they're very clever people.

1235
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:04,722
They planned everything
from the beginning.

1236
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:07,563
They probably made
some deal with Guy.

1237
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:09,447
They gave him success

1238
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:13,489
and he promised them our baby
to use in their rituals.

1239
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:18,325
I know this sounds crazy,
but I've...l've got books here. Look.

1240
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:22,845
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart,

1241
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:24,488
they put a spell on him.

1242
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:28,927
They cast a spell on him and made him
blind so Guy could get his part.

1243
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:30,762
Look, here.

1244
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:37,845
I had this friend, Edward Hutchins,
a writer. He wrote stories for boys.

1245
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:41,320
He was my good friend
since I first came to New York.

1246
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,560
- May I keep this?
- Yes, please.

1247
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:47,768
And, look, anyway,
once Mr Hutchins came to visit me...

1248
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:52,366
It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.

1249
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:56,728
I was suffering so... You can't
imagine how much I was suffering,

1250
01:43:56,810 --> 01:43:58,562
and they wouldn't help me.

1251
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:01,960
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.

1252
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:04,325
Also witches' stuff, tannis root.

1253
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:07,959
Hutch came and immediately
saw something was wrong.

1254
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:10,006
He...he knew about witches.

1255
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:13,560
Guy rushed in with his makeup on,
which he never did.

1256
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:18,087
They probably called him to come home
and steal one of Hutch's belongings.

1257
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:22,243
He took his glove
and they put a spell on him, too.

1258
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:26,084
Put him in a coma.
Three months later he died.

1259
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:29,958
Maybe all this is coincidence,
but one thing is for sure,

1260
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:32,245
they have a coven and want my baby.

1261
01:44:35,530 --> 01:44:37,566
Certainly seems that way.

1262
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:49,284
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

1263
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:51,042
I don't believe in witchcraft,

1264
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:54,486
but there are plenty
of crazy people in this city.

1265
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:59,280
- The doctor's name is Shand?
- No, Dr Shand is one of them.

1266
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:03,727
- The doctor's name is Sapirstein.
- Abraham Sapirstein?

1267
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:06,449
Yeah.

1268
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:09,806
- Do you know him?
- I've met him once or twice.

1269
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:12,245
To look at him, you' d never think...

1270
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:15,163
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.

1271
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:19,163
Would you like to go
into Mount Sinai now, this evening?

1272
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:22,686
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?

1273
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:24,806
It's difficult, but we'll try.

1274
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:27,723
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.

1275
01:45:27,810 --> 01:45:32,440
Thanks. Anything they've got,
even a broom closet would be fine.

1276
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:35,203
I hope we can do better than that.

1277
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:44,004
I'll see what I can do,
then I'll check you over.

1278
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:47,529
Oh, should I undress now?

1279
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:50,170
No. It'll take about a half hour.

1280
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:52,241
You just lie down, rest.

1281
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:06,405
God bless Dr Hill.

1282
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:15,645
Everything's going to be
OK now, Andy or Jenny.

1283
01:46:15,730 --> 01:46:20,804
We're going to be in a nice,
clean hospital with no visitors.

1284
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:43,365
Monsters.

1285
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:46,525
Monsters.

1286
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:53,646
Unspeakable. Unspeakable.

1287
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:26,362
I was sleeping.

1288
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:43,849
Come with us quietly, Rosemary.
Don't argue or make a scene.

1289
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:46,524
If you say
anything more about witches

1290
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:49,249
we'll take you to a mental hospital.

1291
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:52,686
You don't want that, do you?
So put your shoes on.

1292
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:56,479
We just want to take you home.
No one's going to hurt you.

1293
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:58,606
Or the baby. Put your shoes on.

1294
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:17,848
She's fine now.

1295
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:21,809
- We're going to go home and rest.
- That's all it takes.

1296
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:24,688
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Glad I could help, sir.

1297
01:48:24,770 --> 01:48:26,522
It's a shame you had to come here.

1298
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:19,526
Good evening, Mrs Woodhouse.

1299
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:36,122
Mrs Woodhouse!

1300
01:49:36,730 --> 01:49:38,448
Mrs Woodhouse!

1301
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:53,605
- Come on, open up, Ro.
- Go to hell!

1302
01:50:53,690 --> 01:50:56,762
- Come on, honey.
- You promised them the baby!

1303
01:50:56,850 --> 01:50:58,966
I didn't promise them anything!

1304
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:02,281
- Rosemary, you're...
- You, too!

1305
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:33,886
- Hello?
- Elise?

1306
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:37,929
- Mrs Dunstan is out.
- Who is this? Where is she?

1307
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:40,683
- At the movies.
- This is Rosemary.

1308
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:43,364
Ask her to call me
when she gets home.

1309
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:46,806
It's terribly urgent.
Don't...don't forget.

1310
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:49,848
- Don't worry. I'll tell her.
- Thank you.

1311
01:51:56,210 --> 01:52:00,886
- We don't want to hurt you, Ro.
- We're your friends, Rosemary.

1312
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:04,519
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Honest there isn't.

1313
01:52:04,610 --> 01:52:08,398
- This is just a mild sedative.
- I wouldn't let anyone...

1314
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:14,448
Help me!

1315
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:17,886
- Oh, Ro, baby.
- Somebody help me!

1316
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:31,801
Wait a minute. Wait a minute now.

1317
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:40,080
- We're in labour here.
- Here?

1318
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:44,527
You'll be all right, baby. You're
going to be perfectly all right.

1319
01:52:44,610 --> 01:52:48,603
There were supposed to be doctors,
hospitals!

1320
01:52:48,690 --> 01:52:53,206
Everything...clean and sterile!

1321
01:52:53,290 --> 01:52:55,850
Hello? She isn't here, Elise.

1322
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:05,444
Oh, Andy... Andy or Jenny...

1323
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:08,727
I...l'm sorry, my little darling.

1324
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,725
Forgive me.

1325
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:24,047
Hi.

1326
01:53:28,450 --> 01:53:30,361
Hi.

1327
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:34,604
Is it all right?

1328
01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:37,841
Yes, it's fine.

1329
01:53:39,810 --> 01:53:43,962
- What is it?
- A boy.

1330
01:53:48,130 --> 01:53:50,439
Really? A boy?

1331
01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:02,848
- And it's all right?
- Yes.

1332
01:54:21,810 --> 01:54:23,687
Where is it?

1333
01:54:23,770 --> 01:54:26,330
Oh, my goodness.

1334
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:29,561
Oh, gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.

1335
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:31,561
The baby, where is it?

1336
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:34,448
Oh, uh, you wait here one minute.

1337
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:37,962
Where's my baby?

1338
01:54:38,050 --> 01:54:41,963
Uh, I'll go find Dr Abe.
Just wait.

1339
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:59,166
Where's the baby?

1340
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:05,724
- Where is it?
- Honey...

1341
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:10,804
There were complications, but nothing
that will affect future births.

1342
01:55:13,050 --> 01:55:14,722
It's...

1343
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:18,478
Dead. It was in the wrong position.

1344
01:55:18,570 --> 01:55:21,323
In hospital
I might have done something.

1345
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:23,560
Honey, we can have others.

1346
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:26,881
You can try again in a few months.

1347
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:28,722
When you're better.

1348
01:55:28,810 --> 01:55:32,962
No. I don't believe you.
You're both lying.

1349
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:35,518
You're lying! It didn't die!

1350
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:37,805
You took it! You're lying!

1351
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:40,484
You're witches! You're lying!

1352
01:55:40,570 --> 01:55:43,482
You're lying! You're lying!

1353
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,568
You're lying!

1354
01:55:53,090 --> 01:55:57,163
Abe says it's called...pre-partum.

1355
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:00,083
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.

1356
01:56:00,170 --> 01:56:03,845
Boy, you were really kapow,
out of your mind.

1357
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:11,204
Uh, I know where you got the idea
that Minnie and Roman were witches,

1358
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:16,284
but, um, how come you thought
that Abe and I joined the party?

1359
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:25,446
Let's face it, darling,
you had the...pre-partum crazies.

1360
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:30,479
Now you're gonna rest
and you're gonna get over them.

1361
01:56:30,570 --> 01:56:35,041
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

1362
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:37,325
but now everything's gonna be roses.

1363
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:41,039
Paramount's right where we want them,
Universal's interested,

1364
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:44,566
and we're gonna blow this town
and be in beautiful Beverly

1365
01:56:44,650 --> 01:56:49,644
with a pool and a spice garden,
the whole schmeer, and kids, too, Ro.

1366
01:56:49,730 --> 01:56:52,528
Scout's honour.
You heard what Abe said.

1367
01:56:55,690 --> 01:56:58,523
Now, I got to run now and get famous.

1368
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:03,724
Let me...see your shoulder.

1369
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:08,524
Let me see your shoulder.

1370
01:57:08,610 --> 01:57:12,319
- Are you kidding?
- Your left shoulder.

1371
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:14,765
All right. Anything you say.

1372
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:22,525
I generally prefer doing this
to music. Left shoulder.

1373
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:26,405
Right shoulder.

1374
01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:31,882
And that's as far as I go
without a blue light.

1375
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:40,488
The high pressure area
causing this heat...

1376
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:45,759
And will be staying with us
through the week.

1377
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:49,042
It will be overcast
upstate New York as well

1378
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:52,520
with the possibility
of thunder showers tonight

1379
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:54,885
clearing by tomorrow night.

1380
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:59,566
All you people leaving the city
this weekend should find it hot.

1381
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:25,285
Do you hear a baby crying?

1382
01:58:25,370 --> 01:58:27,759
Why, no, I don't, dear.

1383
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:31,763
Now, into your bed now.
It's time for you to take your pill.

1384
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:43,324
Did you turn the air conditioner off?

1385
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:46,246
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.

1386
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:49,163
People are actually dying,
it's so hot.

1387
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:05,963
What do you do with the milk?

1388
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:09,804
Why, uh, throw it away.
Your pill, Rosemary.

1389
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:19,923
Hello, girls.

1390
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:23,127
95 out.

1391
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:26,607
Some new people
moved on in up in eight.

1392
01:59:26,690 --> 01:59:28,999
Do they have a baby?

1393
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:32,088
How' d you know that?

1394
01:59:33,170 --> 01:59:35,206
I heard it crying.

1395
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:38,008
Oh, wait a minute.

1396
01:59:41,210 --> 01:59:45,283
- Oh, no. Don't do that.
- Why not?

1397
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:48,806
Uh, a little messy, that's all.

1398
02:02:31,770 --> 02:02:33,726
Easy, easy.

1399
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:53,008
Got her too high.

1400
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:20,405
Oh, hell, Hayato.
You're making fun of me.

1401
02:03:20,490 --> 02:03:23,004
You're pulling my leg, like we say.

1402
02:03:51,050 --> 02:03:55,407
Rosemary, go back to bed. You know
you're not supposed to be up.

1403
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:58,641
- The mother?
- Rosemary...

1404
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:01,961
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.

1405
02:04:43,450 --> 02:04:46,123
What have you done to it?

1406
02:04:46,210 --> 02:04:48,883
What have you done to its eyes?

1407
02:04:48,970 --> 02:04:50,722
He has his father's eyes.

1408
02:04:55,610 --> 02:04:59,046
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.

1409
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:02,008
What have you done to him,
you maniacs?!

1410
02:05:02,090 --> 02:05:04,320
Satan is his father, not Guy.

1411
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:08,483
He came up from hell
and begat a son of mortal woman.

1412
02:05:08,570 --> 02:05:10,526
- Hail, Satan.
- Hail, Satan.

1413
02:05:10,610 --> 02:05:13,522
Satan is his father,
and his name is Adrian.

1414
02:05:13,610 --> 02:05:18,047
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.

1415
02:05:18,130 --> 02:05:23,045
He shall wreak vengeance in the name
of the burned and the tortured!

1416
02:05:23,130 --> 02:05:25,644
- Hail, Adrian!
- Hail, Adrian!

1417
02:05:25,730 --> 02:05:27,686
Hail, Satan! Hail, Satan!

1418
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:29,362
Hail, Satan!

1419
02:05:29,450 --> 02:05:33,648
He chose you. Out of all the women
in the whole world, he chose you.

1420
02:05:33,730 --> 02:05:36,847
He wanted you to be
the mother of his only son.

1421
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:39,319
His power is stronger than stronger!

1422
02:05:39,410 --> 02:05:42,163
His might shall last
longer than longer!

1423
02:05:42,250 --> 02:05:45,481
- Hail, Satan!
- No!

1424
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:49,685
It can't be! No!

1425
02:05:49,970 --> 02:05:52,803
- Go look at his hands.
- And his feet.

1426
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:57,005
Oh, God!

1427
02:05:58,090 --> 02:06:01,685
- God is dead! Satan lives!
- Hail, Satan!

1428
02:06:01,770 --> 02:06:04,330
- The year is one!
- Hail, Satan!

1429
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:07,482
- The year is one and God is done!
- Oh, God!

1430
02:06:07,570 --> 02:06:11,688
- The year is one!
- Hail, Adrian!

1431
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:13,920
Hail, Satan!

1432
02:06:14,010 --> 02:06:18,208
Why don't you help us out, Rosemary?
Be a real mother to Adrian.

1433
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:21,168
You don't have to join
if you don't want to.

1434
02:06:21,250 --> 02:06:23,286
Just be a mother to your baby.

1435
02:06:24,370 --> 02:06:29,125
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.
It's not right.

1436
02:06:31,450 --> 02:06:33,202
Think about it, Rosemary.

1437
02:06:45,970 --> 02:06:47,483
Oh, God!

1438
02:06:47,570 --> 02:06:50,687
Oh, shut up or we'll kill you,
milk or no milk.

1439
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:55,127
You shut up. Rosemary's his mother.
Show some respect.

1440
02:06:57,050 --> 02:07:01,168
Come, my friend.
Come see him. Come see the child.

1441
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:13,165
What would you like to drink?

1442
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:18,287
They promised you wouldn't be hurt,
and you haven't been, really.

1443
02:07:18,370 --> 02:07:22,329
I mean, supposing you had the baby
and you lost it.

1444
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:25,206
Wouldn't that be the same?

1445
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:28,680
And we're getting
so much in return, Ro.

1446
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:42,643
Oh, Guy, let me introduce
you to Argyron Stavropoulos.

1447
02:07:42,730 --> 02:07:45,403
How proud you must be.

1448
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:48,163
Is this the mother?
Why in the name of...

1449
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:51,720
- Here, drink this.
- What's in it? Tannis root?

1450
02:07:51,810 --> 02:07:55,564
Just plain, ordinary Lipton's tea.
You drink it.

1451
02:08:25,890 --> 02:08:30,441
- Get away from here. Roman!
- You're rocking him too fast.

1452
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:33,124
Sit down! Put her where she belongs.

1453
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:36,759
You're rocking him too fast.
That's why he's crying.

1454
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:40,160
- Mind your own business.
- Let Rosemary rock him.

1455
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:43,083
- Sit with the others.
- She's liable to...

1456
02:08:43,170 --> 02:08:45,889
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.

1457
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:56,566
Rock him.

1458
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:01,806
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.

1459
02:09:01,890 --> 02:09:03,801
Aren't you his mother?
