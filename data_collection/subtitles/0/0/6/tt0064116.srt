1
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,131
If you want any tickets,

2
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:33,927
you'll have to go round
to the front of...

3
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,680
Well, I suppose it'll be alright.

4
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,891
What the hell am I doing around here?

5
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,935
They walk in here and...

6
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,026
Let's see. I hope I got...

7
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,111
Three?

8
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,420
That'll be seven dollars...

9
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,011
..and 50 cents.

10
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,895
No.

11
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,473
Frank?

12
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,312
Frank sent us.

13
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,818
Did you bring a horse for me?

14
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,409
Well, looks like we're...

15
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,079
Looks like we're shy of one horse.

16
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,254
You brought two too many.

17
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,244
Pa!

18
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,371
Look!

19
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,564
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

20
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,538
Timmy.

21
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,966
Maureen, look.

22
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,757
What you doing there?

23
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,843
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

24
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,554
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

25
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,224
Patrick's already left
for the station.

26
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,101
He's getting ready, Pa.

27
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,520
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

28
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,150
Not bad, I'd say.

29
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,990
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

30
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,659
But these are
the same slices as usual.

31
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,332
Yeah, sure.

32
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,127
As usual.

33
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,132
Maureen.

34
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:17,139
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

35
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,766
You'll have beautiful new clothes

36
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,603
and you won't have to work no more.

37
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:25,147
We're going to get rich, Pa?

38
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,821
Who knows?

39
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,200
Patrick!

40
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,410
Wait a minute!

41
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,164
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean 'em.

42
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:51,048
The train'll come in and there
won't be no one to meet your mother.

43
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,093
Our mother died six years ago.

44
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,648
Go now, or you'll really be late.

45
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,947
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How will I recognise her?

46
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,199
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

47
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:23,247
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

48
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:29,294
"For travelling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

49
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:36,802
and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met."

50
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,649
I'm gonna get
some fresh water from the well.

51
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,821
Oh, Danny boy

52
00:19:55,988 --> 00:20:00,075
The pipes, the pipes are calling

53
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,415
And down the mountain side

54
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,208
The summer's gone

55
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:12,754
And all the roses fall...

56
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,686
Maureen!

57
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,483
What are we gonna do with this one,
Frank?

58
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,585
Now that you've called me by name...

59
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,147
- I saw some fine stock down south.
- That so?

60
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,733
And the prices are good.

61
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,746
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

62
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,998
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

63
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,959
We'll tote 'em for you, ma'am.

64
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,316
Is that true?
The sawmill needs hands?

65
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:09,278
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

66
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,989
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

67
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:14,074
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

68
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:19,663
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

69
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,082
I got a whole train to unload.

70
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,252
Alright,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

71
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,754
Come on!

72
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,592
What's the name
of the place you wanted to go?

73
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,093
Sweetwater.

74
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,056
Brett McBain's farm.

75
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,894
McBain? Yeah, sure.

76
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,355
That stubborn redheaded lrishman,

77
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:35,067
tilling sand for years
out in the middle of nowhere.

78
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:38,362
Sweetwater! Only a loony like him

79
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:42,366
could call that stinking piece
of desert Sweetwater.

80
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,326
Sweetwater!

81
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,296
A little more to the right.

82
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,715
Higher.

83
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:42,384
Hold it there.

84
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,022
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

85
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:59,151
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

86
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:01,904
Slow down.
What's the matter with you?

87
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,492
Watch out down there!

88
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,659
Slow down!

89
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:17,020
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

90
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:19,398
Don't the train stop?

91
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,924
What can I do for you, ma'am?

92
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:11,760
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

93
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:16,473
Water? That word is poison
around these parts

94
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,809
ever since the days
of the great flood.

95
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:22,020
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

96
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:25,107
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

97
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:28,610
You sure can. Just happen
to have a full tub at the back.

98
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:32,823
You're lucky. Only three people
have used it this morning.

99
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,659
Used it one at a time
or all together?

100
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:43,834
I can tell
you're accustomed to fine living.

101
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,129
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

102
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,840
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

103
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:51,884
- You've been there?
- No.

104
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,553
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

105
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,930
You know, she...

106
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,074
Jug.

107
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,996
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

108
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,752
Do you know
how to blow music from that?

109
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:17,858
Pick it up.

110
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,261
You!

111
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,728
You don't know how to play.

112
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,712
Try this one.

113
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,229
Take it.

114
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:58,500
Go on.

115
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,637
Here.

116
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:52,888
Bravo.

117
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:20,415
Cheyenne.
We thought we'd never make it.

118
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:23,418
It's alright. You're right on time.

119
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,257
To bury my escort.

120
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:33,262
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

121
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,206
The gun.

122
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:26,315
You interested in fashions,
Harmonica?

123
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,824
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

124
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:38,076
They were waiting for a train.

125
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:46,585
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

126
00:43:49,046 --> 00:43:50,255
So?

127
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:54,426
Inside the men,
there were three bullets.

128
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:09,441
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

129
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,654
For two reasons.

130
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:16,406
One, nobody around these parts

131
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:19,910
got the guts to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's, man.

132
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:24,998
Two, Cheyenne's, man,
don't get killed.

133
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,296
That surprise you?

134
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:33,215
Yeah.

135
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:39,555
Well, you know music.

136
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:43,851
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

137
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:54,194
All the way up to six, if I have to.

138
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:58,073
And maybe faster than you.

139
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,547
Yeah, go on.

140
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:15,883
Play, Harmonica.

141
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:18,844
Play, so you can't bullshit.

142
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,931
Only, watch those false notes.

143
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,691
Like so?

144
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:51,043
This cousin of mine keeps writing me
to come down to New Orleans.

145
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,922
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

146
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,883
I don't think
I'd get along in a big city.

147
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,427
It's too full
of fast men and loose women.

148
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:03,138
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

149
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:08,435
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet simple country life.

150
00:48:38,961 --> 00:48:40,712
He's Timmy.

151
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:43,841
Yes.

152
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,051
Dear God.

153
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,388
On the day...

154
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:53,725
On the very day of your wedding.

155
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:56,937
Poor little miss.

156
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,898
Mrs.

157
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:02,860
Mrs McBain.

158
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:05,988
But we all... We thought...

159
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:08,365
I know.

160
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:12,619
It was to be a surprise today.

161
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,122
Brett McBain and I were married.

162
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,416
A month ago.

163
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,377
In New Orleans.

164
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:38,645
I am the resurrection and the life.

165
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:42,357
He who believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

166
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:46,778
Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die. Amen.

167
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:05,714
- Mr Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

168
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,428
I found this collar
on a nail by the door.

169
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:19,728
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

170
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:21,897
Cheyenne's hand.

171
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:27,110
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs McBain.

172
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:29,738
We'll make 'em tell us
before we hang 'em.

173
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:33,158
Let's get moving.

174
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:56,640
Come on.
Let's go back to Flagstone.

175
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,603
No, Sam.

176
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,232
You go back.

177
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:08,902
You don't want
to stay out here alone.

178
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:11,405
Why not?

179
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,365
This is my home.

180
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:14,148
You know, Wobbles,...

181
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,819
..I'm kinda mad at you.

182
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,074
Frank wasn't there.

183
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,995
He sent three friends.

184
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:30,831
I don't know nothing, I swear.

185
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:35,460
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

186
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:38,922
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

187
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:42,676
- I swear to you that l...
- Cos he was at the McBains'.

188
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:46,180
That's not true.
Cheyenne did that job.

189
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,099
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

190
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:53,395
That was always one
of Frank's tricks. Faking evidence.

191
00:55:55,481 --> 00:55:58,442
I don't know. I swear.

192
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:02,905
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

193
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,491
I don't know nothing.

194
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:07,779
Who's there?

195
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:41,475
Did you make coffee?

196
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:47,189
Make it.

197
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:57,074
Didn't sleep a wink.

198
01:00:57,241 --> 01:01:01,578
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

199
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:07,793
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

200
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,338
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

201
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:33,068
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

202
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:43,662
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

203
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:47,166
Idiots.

204
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:49,084
What the hell?

205
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:52,171
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

206
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:55,507
Be like killing a priest.

207
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:58,051
A Catholic priest, that is.

208
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:02,139
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

209
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:21,325
See, I ain't
the mean bastard people make out.

210
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:30,125
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,...

211
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,588
..it fires me up.

212
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:38,217
And a fired-up Cheyenne...

213
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:43,388
..ain't a nice thing to see.

214
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,682
Especially for a lady.

215
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:01,615
But you're too smart to make him mad.

216
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:10,499
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

217
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:14,044
Yeah.

218
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:17,840
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

219
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:28,559
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me,...

220
01:03:32,229 --> 01:03:35,149
..so they can hang this thing
around my neck,...

221
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,402
..I don't like it none.

222
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:41,697
But I can understand it.

223
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:50,873
What I don't understand is why.

224
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:53,584
Neither do l.

225
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:01,675
But I see you looked a lot
for the why.

226
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:09,516
Yeah.

227
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:16,398
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

228
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:20,777
Round. Yellow.

229
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:23,447
You know the kind.

230
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:26,658
You rap 'em on a stone,...

231
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:30,245
..and they go "ding".

232
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:31,538
Maybe.

233
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:36,293
But I didn't find them.

234
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:44,051
By the way,

235
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:49,097
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

236
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:53,936
He's somebody you'd remember.

237
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,606
Instead of talking, he plays.

238
01:04:58,482 --> 01:05:01,276
And when he'd better play, he talks.

239
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:09,201
You know, when you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

240
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,124
Sure. You're an expert.

241
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,757
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

242
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,598
Of course I have.

243
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:35,561
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

244
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:39,356
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

245
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:41,275
And even call in your men.

246
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:44,153
Well, no woman ever died from that.

247
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:48,365
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

248
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:50,742
and I'll be exactly
what I was before.

249
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:54,454
With just another filthy memory.

250
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,515
You make good coffee, at least.

251
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:15,642
Not bad.

252
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:17,936
Congratulations.

253
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:22,107
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

254
01:06:22,274 --> 01:06:25,277
I only told you to scare them.

255
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:28,405
People scare better
when they're dying.

256
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:32,451
And can you tell me
what good was your stupid massacre?

257
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:36,330
Now, a Mrs McBain has turned up.

258
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:41,960
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

259
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:45,547
Let's say
this is something I didn't plan on.

260
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:49,593
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

261
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:53,388
You know that.

262
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:57,559
I got on board
in sight of the Atlantic,

263
01:06:57,726 --> 01:07:00,896
and before my eyes rot,

264
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:06,527
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

265
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:09,071
I know where you got on board.

266
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:11,615
I was there, too, remember.

267
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:22,918
To remove small obstacles
from the track, you said.

268
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:25,462
Well, there were a few.

269
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:33,053
But we travelled a long way,
just the same.

270
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,763
And fast.

271
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:38,767
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

272
01:07:40,561 --> 01:07:44,439
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr Morton.

273
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:47,860
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

274
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:54,741
I watch that dry rot
rise a little more every day.

275
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:59,663
Any normal man'd
put a bullet in his brain.

276
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:03,834
But you,
you just got a little more hasty.

277
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:07,045
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

278
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:09,631
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

279
01:08:09,798 --> 01:08:11,258
A lot.

280
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:16,096
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

281
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:21,351
Now, you're keeping
in the background.

282
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:24,980
You'll end up giving orders.

283
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:30,194
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

284
01:08:32,738 --> 01:08:36,950
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

285
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:39,786
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

286
01:08:50,464 --> 01:08:53,967
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

287
01:08:57,054 --> 01:08:59,640
It's almost like holding a gun.

288
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:07,189
Only much more powerful.

289
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:26,708
You see, staying with you, l...

290
01:09:28,168 --> 01:09:31,171
..I'm beginning to think big, too.

291
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:36,677
This McBain business...

292
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,264
..has given me ideas.

293
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:49,189
I'm sorry for you, Frank.

294
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:51,567
You're doing your best.

295
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:54,945
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

296
01:09:57,906 --> 01:09:58,991
Why?

297
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:04,746
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

298
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:18,468
This is one of them.

299
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:22,222
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

300
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:27,394
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

301
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:24,409
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

302
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:29,873
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr Morton,

303
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:35,045
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

304
01:11:36,088 --> 01:11:40,050
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

305
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:45,639
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you."

306
01:11:45,806 --> 01:11:48,475
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

307
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:51,145
And then you happen to meet
a man like this,

308
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:53,105
who looked like a good man.

309
01:11:53,272 --> 01:11:55,983
Clear eyes, strong hands.

310
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,026
And he wants to marry you.

311
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:00,320
Which doesn't happen often.

312
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:03,490
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

313
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:09,955
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans."

314
01:12:10,122 --> 01:12:13,125
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country."

315
01:12:15,127 --> 01:12:19,006
"l wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all."

316
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,511
"Take care of a house. Do something.
What the hell?"

317
01:12:35,314 --> 01:12:38,442
Well, God rest your soul,
Brett McBain.

318
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:43,530
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

319
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,548
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

320
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:06,386
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

321
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:09,181
Mrs McBain goes back to civilisation.

322
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:12,935
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

323
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:27,783
You deserve better.

324
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:33,997
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

325
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,009
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

326
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:52,432
She was the biggest whore
in Alameida

327
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:55,644
and the finest woman that ever lived.

328
01:13:56,728 --> 01:14:00,232
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,...

329
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:04,027
..he must have been a happy man.

330
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:27,152
What do you want?

331
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:33,951
Cheyenne's right. Once you've killed
four, it's easy to make it five.

332
01:15:47,756 --> 01:15:50,175
This isn't the time to leave.

333
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:54,615
Give me some water.

334
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:06,043
From the well.

335
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:09,796
I like my water fresh.

336
01:18:36,049 --> 01:18:39,595
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

337
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:42,556
A sound? Like what?

338
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:45,434
Like that.

339
01:19:16,507 --> 01:19:20,886
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

340
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,505
Morning, Mrs McBain.

341
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:59,174
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

342
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:02,636
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

343
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:04,721
I remember very well.

344
01:20:04,888 --> 01:20:07,766
Is there something I can do for you?

345
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:10,644
Yes.

346
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:16,191
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

347
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:19,278
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

348
01:20:19,444 --> 01:20:21,989
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

349
01:20:22,156 --> 01:20:25,367
I got my own worries, and all I want
is to be left in peace.

350
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:29,705
Tell Frank I want to negotiate
with him. Personally.

351
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:27,846
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

352
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:31,767
Whatever business you have with
Frank, keep it far away from here.

353
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:35,521
I know, but when I heard that woman
say she knew everything,

354
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:38,899
I thought I should come over here
and tell you about it.

355
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:41,068
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

356
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:43,570
Sure, but you know
I'm mighty careful.

357
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:45,864
No one could have followed me.

358
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:48,867
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

359
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:51,453
To listen unseen
and to watch unheard.

360
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:55,874
You should learn
to live as if you didn't exist.

361
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:58,335
You've known me a long time, Frank.

362
01:21:58,502 --> 01:22:00,420
You know you can trust me.

363
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:02,214
Wobbles.

364
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:10,681
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

365
01:22:11,598 --> 01:22:14,351
The man
can't even trust his own pants.

366
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:25,571
Let's get out of here.

367
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:07,130
The end of the line.

368
01:24:10,259 --> 01:24:11,218
Yeah.

369
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:18,559
Get him on board.

370
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:35,159
Tie him up.

371
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:10,819
Wait, Frank.

372
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:12,446
I didn't...

373
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:14,072
So, nobody followed you?

374
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:16,992
No. You gotta believe me.

375
01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:20,704
So, this is the way I can trust you.

376
01:25:20,871 --> 01:25:23,624
I can explain.
I didn't know that he...

377
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,044
- Get out.
- No, Frank.

378
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:29,421
Get out.

379
01:25:48,607 --> 01:25:50,734
Frank, wait!

380
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:15,300
I told you to keep quiet.

381
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:22,099
Did Logan and Jim
take care of the woman?

382
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:24,434
Someone took care of them.

383
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:27,020
We found them out at McBain's place.

384
01:26:27,187 --> 01:26:30,149
Stone dead.
And the woman was gone.

385
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:33,986
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

386
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:47,958
First three, then two.

387
01:27:00,012 --> 01:27:02,723
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

388
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:07,102
And you're the one
who doesn't keep 'em.

389
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:10,898
What do you want?

390
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:14,193
Who are you?

391
01:27:16,862 --> 01:27:18,447
Dave Jenkins.

392
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:29,208
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

393
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:32,377
Calder Benson.

394
01:27:34,254 --> 01:27:36,590
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

395
01:27:38,592 --> 01:27:40,677
You ought to know better than anyone.

396
01:27:40,844 --> 01:27:42,262
You killed 'em.

397
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:43,889
Who are you?

398
01:27:44,056 --> 01:27:46,266
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

399
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:49,519
The woman.

400
01:27:51,271 --> 01:27:53,857
We're only losing time.

401
01:27:58,195 --> 01:28:02,991
Alright. This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

402
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:05,619
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

403
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:12,626
Keep him warm for me.

404
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,170
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

405
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:19,716
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

406
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:27,349
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

407
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:30,393
Keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

408
01:28:30,519 --> 01:28:32,062
Sure, Frank.

409
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:06,490
- See anyone?
- No.

410
01:30:26,843 --> 01:30:28,637
There he is.

411
01:33:11,216 --> 01:33:13,718
You only know how to shoot?

412
01:33:15,762 --> 01:33:17,889
Or do you know how to cut, too?

413
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:31,945
You.

414
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:34,531
Wait a minute.

415
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:38,452
Let's have a good look at you.

416
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:51,882
Mr Choo-Choo.

417
01:34:10,233 --> 01:34:13,820
It's easy to find you. Bastard.

418
01:34:13,945 --> 01:34:16,239
I don't have to kill you now.

419
01:34:16,364 --> 01:34:18,742
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

420
01:34:18,867 --> 01:34:22,954
Two beautiful shiny rails.

421
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:25,165
There's another bastard.

422
01:34:25,749 --> 01:34:28,293
And he's getting further away
every minute.

423
01:34:40,931 --> 01:34:43,892
There it is.
What your husband ordered from me.

424
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:48,105
And seeing as how he paid cash,
it all belongs to you.

425
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:51,483
Oak planks, beech, pine.

426
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:53,652
All first-grade lumber.

427
01:34:53,777 --> 01:34:56,446
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

428
01:34:56,571 --> 01:35:00,659
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

429
01:35:00,784 --> 01:35:03,203
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

430
01:35:03,328 --> 01:35:05,247
Enlarge the farmhouse?

431
01:35:05,372 --> 01:35:08,583
He could have built
at least eight of them.

432
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:10,585
By the way, ma'am,

433
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:14,256
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

434
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:19,010
Only it seems he forgot to tell
me what he wanted printed on it.

435
01:35:26,268 --> 01:35:27,686
Station.

436
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:29,896
How's that again?

437
01:35:30,021 --> 01:35:32,649
I said print "station".

438
01:36:04,556 --> 01:36:06,600
Looking for this?

439
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:09,728
I've had enough
of your butcher tactics.

440
01:36:09,853 --> 01:36:12,230
I know that woman is here.

441
01:36:12,355 --> 01:36:15,150
I don't want
any more useless killing.

442
01:36:15,275 --> 01:36:18,403
I'm ready to make a deal
for that land.

443
01:36:18,528 --> 01:36:20,655
To pay what's necessary.

444
01:36:20,781 --> 01:36:23,200
I don't want to waste any more time.

445
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:26,411
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

446
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:34,503
When you're not on that train, you
look like a turtle out of its shell.

447
01:36:35,295 --> 01:36:37,047
Just funny.

448
01:36:37,172 --> 01:36:41,384
Poor cripple talking big
so nobody'll know how scared you are.

449
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:43,345
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

450
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:48,934
I don't have time
to compete with you.

451
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:56,441
Compete?

452
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:05,033
Why, you... You can't even
stand on your own feet by yourself.

453
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:18,338
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

454
01:37:19,172 --> 01:37:22,425
I could squash you
like a wormy apple.

455
01:37:24,177 --> 01:37:27,264
Sure, but you won't do it.

456
01:37:28,014 --> 01:37:31,309
Because it's not to your advantage.

457
01:37:38,775 --> 01:37:41,778
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs.

458
01:37:49,953 --> 01:37:53,457
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

459
01:37:55,917 --> 01:37:58,795
Morton.
Don't worry about the land.

460
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:01,381
If you feel like paying for it,
you can pay.

461
01:38:01,506 --> 01:38:05,218
It won't make any difference to you,
dealing with the new owner.

462
01:38:31,912 --> 01:38:34,748
Cheyenne!

463
01:38:34,873 --> 01:38:38,084
There's a square staked out here.
It says "water tank".

464
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:42,380
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office".

465
01:38:42,506 --> 01:38:44,508
And this one says "corral".

466
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:46,968
And this here "church".

467
01:38:47,552 --> 01:38:50,097
What the hell is this?

468
01:38:50,222 --> 01:38:51,556
Can't you see?

469
01:38:52,808 --> 01:38:54,184
It's a station.

470
01:38:55,185 --> 01:38:57,979
And all around it, a town.

471
01:39:00,398 --> 01:39:02,609
Brett McBain's town.

472
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:07,531
Was he crazy!

473
01:39:07,656 --> 01:39:09,991
Yeah, in a very special way.

474
01:39:11,993 --> 01:39:14,079
An lrishman.

475
01:39:15,413 --> 01:39:20,168
He knew that railroad coming through
Flagstone would continue on west.

476
01:39:20,293 --> 01:39:23,088
So he looked over
all this country out here

477
01:39:23,213 --> 01:39:25,799
until he found this hunk of desert.

478
01:39:26,716 --> 01:39:28,718
Nobody wanted it.

479
01:39:32,764 --> 01:39:34,015
But he bought it.

480
01:39:36,726 --> 01:39:41,231
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

481
01:39:42,732 --> 01:39:44,776
Waited for what?

482
01:39:46,194 --> 01:39:48,947
For the railroad to reach this point.

483
01:39:49,072 --> 01:39:54,494
But how could he be sure the railroad
would pass through his property?

484
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,999
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

485
01:39:59,124 --> 01:40:04,463
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

486
01:40:04,588 --> 01:40:05,755
Under this land.

487
01:40:06,882 --> 01:40:10,177
He was no fool, our dead friend.

488
01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:14,806
He was going to sell this piece
of desert for its weight in gold.

489
01:40:15,599 --> 01:40:18,435
You don't sell
the dream of a lifetime.

490
01:40:20,061 --> 01:40:22,564
Brett McBain wanted his station.

491
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:27,277
He got the rights to build it.

492
01:40:29,529 --> 01:40:32,491
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

493
01:40:32,616 --> 01:40:35,702
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

494
01:40:36,912 --> 01:40:38,246
One thing, though.

495
01:40:38,371 --> 01:40:42,834
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

496
01:40:42,959 --> 01:40:46,838
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

497
01:40:46,963 --> 01:40:50,300
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point,...

498
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:53,678
..the station ain't built yet.

499
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,773
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

500
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,155
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

501
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:17,119
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

502
01:41:17,244 --> 01:41:18,537
Yeah.

503
01:41:18,662 --> 01:41:20,038
Yeah.

504
01:41:21,123 --> 01:41:22,749
Listen.

505
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,918
Harmonica.

506
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:29,131
A town built around the railroad.

507
01:41:30,882 --> 01:41:33,176
You could make a fortune.

508
01:41:34,219 --> 01:41:37,055
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

509
01:41:38,223 --> 01:41:40,267
More than that.

510
01:41:41,435 --> 01:41:43,937
Thousands of thousands.

511
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:47,190
They call them millions.

512
01:41:48,316 --> 01:41:50,068
Millions?

513
01:41:52,904 --> 01:41:55,198
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

514
01:41:55,323 --> 01:42:00,162
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

515
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:02,789
All you gotta do is...

516
01:42:04,916 --> 01:42:08,253
What in the hell
are you standing around for?

517
01:42:08,837 --> 01:42:10,964
Chief, what are we supposed to do?

518
01:42:11,089 --> 01:42:13,300
What are you supposed to do?

519
01:42:13,425 --> 01:42:15,927
Build a station, idiots!

520
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,224
I figure
it ain't gonna look like much.

521
01:42:24,728 --> 01:42:29,191
But it'll be the first thing she sees
when she gets back.

522
01:42:29,983 --> 01:42:32,235
If she gets back.

523
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:53,483
I think...

524
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:03,326
Yeah.

525
01:44:04,286 --> 01:44:08,331
I'm beginning to think I might be
a little sorry killing you.

526
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:13,128
You like being alive.

527
01:44:26,266 --> 01:44:29,603
You also like
to feel a man's hands all over you.

528
01:44:31,438 --> 01:44:33,565
You like it.

529
01:44:37,277 --> 01:44:40,947
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

530
01:45:01,134 --> 01:45:03,386
What a...

531
01:45:06,181 --> 01:45:08,266
What a little tramp.

532
01:45:10,727 --> 01:45:15,315
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

533
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:21,029
Nothing, Frank.

534
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:47,222
Now I understand
why they miss you so much...

535
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:52,436
..down there in New Orleans.

536
01:45:55,188 --> 01:45:57,691
Great invention, the telegraph.

537
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:04,072
"Jill? The brunette?"

538
01:46:04,614 --> 01:46:08,910
"The customers of the most elegant
whorehouse on Bourbon Street

539
01:46:09,035 --> 01:46:12,164
have been weeping
ever since she left."

540
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:16,626
Say, tell me.

541
01:46:17,627 --> 01:46:19,713
Did old McBain know?

542
01:46:20,422 --> 01:46:22,466
Yeah.

543
01:46:22,591 --> 01:46:24,926
Yeah, I bet he did.

544
01:46:25,051 --> 01:46:28,138
He was just the type
to marry a whore.

545
01:46:33,769 --> 01:46:35,979
It's an idea.

546
01:46:37,898 --> 01:46:39,941
I could marry you.

547
01:46:40,942 --> 01:46:43,445
And the land would become mine.

548
01:46:44,196 --> 01:46:46,114
And maybe...

549
01:46:48,241 --> 01:46:50,786
..you'd make a perfect wife.

550
01:46:54,498 --> 01:46:58,126
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

551
01:46:59,878 --> 01:47:01,713
Too bad.

552
01:47:01,838 --> 01:47:05,342
We'll have to think
of another solution.

553
01:47:05,467 --> 01:47:07,094
Simpler.

554
01:47:11,973 --> 01:47:14,017
Quicker.

555
01:47:34,955 --> 01:47:37,457
As sheriff of this county,

556
01:47:37,582 --> 01:47:40,877
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

557
01:47:41,002 --> 01:47:45,507
of all property belonging to
Mrs Jill McBain, here present.

558
01:47:46,174 --> 01:47:49,553
This parcel of land
measures 320 acres.

559
01:47:49,678 --> 01:47:53,974
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

560
01:47:54,891 --> 01:47:57,018
This property and all it contains,

561
01:47:57,144 --> 01:47:59,479
Iock, stock and barrel,

562
01:47:59,604 --> 01:48:03,108
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

563
01:48:03,233 --> 01:48:05,861
All the contents therein
are listed by number

564
01:48:05,986 --> 01:48:08,947
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

565
01:48:09,072 --> 01:48:12,993
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

566
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:16,079
Alright. That's clear to everybody.

567
01:48:16,204 --> 01:48:18,039
I declare the auction open.

568
01:48:18,165 --> 01:48:21,001
Now, who's going to make
the first bid?

569
01:48:25,755 --> 01:48:29,885
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.

570
01:48:30,969 --> 01:48:34,514
Alright. Now,
who's going to make the first bid?

571
01:48:38,769 --> 01:48:41,021
$200.

572
01:48:41,146 --> 01:48:43,648
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

573
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:47,652
$200. Do I hear more?

574
01:48:47,778 --> 01:48:51,907
That stinking piece of land
ain't worth it.

575
01:48:52,032 --> 01:48:55,035
Come on, my friends, $200.

576
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:58,288
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

577
01:48:59,748 --> 01:49:01,500
Well...

578
01:49:02,501 --> 01:49:04,711
Who's going to bid $300?

579
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:13,762
Now, look, friends, I realise
we're not offering California here,

580
01:49:13,887 --> 01:49:17,140
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

581
01:49:17,265 --> 01:49:21,353
Ladies and gentlemen, I wouldn't
even take 200 as a deposit.

582
01:49:24,606 --> 01:49:27,943
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

583
01:49:35,867 --> 01:49:38,829
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

584
01:49:41,289 --> 01:49:43,542
I wish I were wrong, Mrs McBain,

585
01:49:43,667 --> 01:49:47,879
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

586
01:49:53,718 --> 01:49:55,762
All I want is to sell.

587
01:51:03,205 --> 01:51:06,625
- You're fat.
- If you say so.

588
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:08,460
- How many?
- One card.

589
01:51:10,712 --> 01:51:12,923
One for me.

590
01:51:15,383 --> 01:51:17,302
Dealer takes three.

591
01:51:27,979 --> 01:51:31,233
Can I take a hand?

592
01:51:36,446 --> 01:51:37,989
1 5.

593
01:51:50,877 --> 01:51:53,505
Yeah, sit down.

594
01:52:17,237 --> 01:52:19,114
I'll deal.

595
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:06,012
How do you...

596
01:54:06,138 --> 01:54:09,015
How do you play this game,
Mr Morton?

597
01:54:11,309 --> 01:54:13,562
It's very simple.

598
01:54:14,479 --> 01:54:19,359
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

599
01:54:19,985 --> 01:54:22,821
$500.

600
01:54:27,159 --> 01:54:29,369
$500.

601
01:54:30,537 --> 01:54:32,789
Do I hear any other bids?

602
01:54:34,833 --> 01:54:37,335
I don't think so.

603
01:54:46,344 --> 01:54:47,679
I'm sorry, Mrs McBain,

604
01:54:47,804 --> 01:54:52,726
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

605
01:55:03,945 --> 01:55:06,406
$500 once.

606
01:55:08,825 --> 01:55:11,536
$500 twice.

607
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:16,208
- $500...
- $5,000.

608
01:55:39,940 --> 01:55:45,237
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

609
01:55:57,624 --> 01:56:00,460
It's Cheyenne!

610
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:12,347
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that's right?

611
01:56:12,472 --> 01:56:17,185
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

612
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:19,813
There were no dollars in them days.

613
01:56:21,857 --> 01:56:24,317
But sons of bitches, yeah.

614
01:56:38,665 --> 01:56:40,959
Wait a minute.

615
01:56:42,627 --> 01:56:45,881
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

616
01:56:46,006 --> 01:56:49,551
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

617
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:52,971
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

618
01:56:53,096 --> 01:56:55,098
They got a modern jail there.

619
01:56:55,223 --> 01:57:00,061
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

620
01:57:00,187 --> 01:57:04,191
You'll like it, in 20 years.
You'll see.

621
01:58:05,752 --> 01:58:09,172
Two tickets, amigo,
to the next station.

622
01:58:09,297 --> 01:58:11,425
One way only.

623
01:58:13,343 --> 01:58:16,304
Here's to you. And congratulations.

624
01:58:21,101 --> 01:58:23,353
You got yourself a good deal.

625
01:58:24,813 --> 01:58:26,106
The auction.

626
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:30,569
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

627
01:58:32,696 --> 01:58:37,325
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenceless widows.

628
01:58:39,369 --> 01:58:41,329
But then again,...

629
01:58:44,332 --> 01:58:47,752
..I don't look
like a poor defenceless widow.

630
01:58:54,259 --> 01:58:57,220
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

631
01:58:58,263 --> 01:59:00,599
And you're a remarkable man.

632
01:59:00,724 --> 01:59:03,393
But you have something on your mind.

633
01:59:09,816 --> 01:59:12,694
Have you got something
on your mind?

634
01:59:15,322 --> 01:59:19,117
Hot water.
A bathtub full of hot water.

635
01:59:37,761 --> 01:59:40,639
I think it's time
I filled that bathtub.

636
02:00:12,087 --> 02:00:14,089
Who are you?

637
02:00:34,484 --> 02:00:36,778
Jim Cooper.

638
02:00:36,903 --> 02:00:38,613
Chuck Youngblood.

639
02:00:39,531 --> 02:00:41,366
More dead men.

640
02:00:44,828 --> 02:00:47,664
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

641
02:00:54,004 --> 02:00:57,674
You paid $5,000
for something that belongs to me.

642
02:01:02,471 --> 02:01:04,765
5,000...

643
02:01:08,810 --> 02:01:11,104
..plus one.

644
02:01:16,067 --> 02:01:18,361
You've got a right
to make a profit, too.

645
02:01:45,097 --> 02:01:48,433
I wouldn't take too long
thinking about it, if I were you.

646
02:01:52,771 --> 02:01:55,774
You got yourself
into something bigger than you.

647
02:01:55,899 --> 02:01:58,777
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

648
02:01:58,902 --> 02:02:02,114
You sound like a real businessman,
Frank.

649
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:05,408
Being with Mr Morton's
done you a lot of good.

650
02:02:13,708 --> 02:02:16,378
And you've learned
some new methods.

651
02:02:17,629 --> 02:02:20,424
Yeah, Mr Morton
has shown you a lot of new ways.

652
02:02:25,178 --> 02:02:27,806
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

653
02:02:29,266 --> 02:02:32,352
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

654
02:02:34,813 --> 02:02:36,440
Which deal, Frank?

655
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:41,403
We have more than one, you and me.

656
02:02:45,282 --> 02:02:50,662
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

657
02:02:50,787 --> 02:02:53,039
Here and now.

658
02:02:55,167 --> 02:02:56,877
Easy, Frank.

659
02:02:57,461 --> 02:02:59,004
Easy.

660
02:02:59,671 --> 02:03:01,882
You gotta learn not to push things.

661
02:03:02,007 --> 02:03:05,177
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

662
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:12,100
I got an idea
Mr Morton can teach you a lot more.

663
02:03:16,688 --> 02:03:18,398
How much?

664
02:03:19,107 --> 02:03:20,192
One dollar.

665
02:04:25,674 --> 02:04:27,300
Giddy up!

666
02:06:01,645 --> 02:06:03,021
Giddy up!

667
02:07:06,835 --> 02:07:09,963
I'd swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

668
02:07:10,088 --> 02:07:11,006
Right now.

669
02:09:03,994 --> 02:09:05,954
Time sure flies.

670
02:09:07,205 --> 02:09:09,708
It's already past 1 2.

671
02:10:08,475 --> 02:10:10,811
But they were his men.

672
02:10:10,936 --> 02:10:13,313
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

673
02:10:13,438 --> 02:10:15,690
They found somebody
who pays better.

674
02:10:15,816 --> 02:10:19,528
And you! You saved his life.

675
02:10:21,696 --> 02:10:24,699
I didn't let them kill him.
That's not the same thing.

676
02:10:37,712 --> 02:10:39,798
Sure.

677
02:10:39,923 --> 02:10:42,300
It's not the same thing.

678
02:10:49,391 --> 02:10:51,143
You get dressed.

679
02:10:51,268 --> 02:10:52,519
It's time to go home.

680
02:16:12,589 --> 02:16:14,132
Did you make coffee?

681
02:16:15,801 --> 02:16:17,886
This time I did.

682
02:16:57,509 --> 02:16:59,761
Good.

683
02:17:01,638 --> 02:17:04,724
My mother
used to make coffee this way.

684
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:10,188
Hot, strong and good.

685
02:17:19,739 --> 02:17:21,450
Cheyenne.

686
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:25,954
What's he waiting for out there?

687
02:17:28,623 --> 02:17:29,624
What's he doing?

688
02:17:35,714 --> 02:17:37,966
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

689
02:17:40,427 --> 02:17:43,680
I got a feeling
when he stops whittling,...

690
02:17:44,973 --> 02:17:47,058
..something's gonna happen.

691
02:18:55,544 --> 02:18:57,379
Surprised to see me here?

692
02:18:59,423 --> 02:19:01,466
I knew you'd come.

693
02:19:24,948 --> 02:19:27,909
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

694
02:19:29,286 --> 02:19:31,538
Now I understand why.

695
02:19:33,373 --> 02:19:37,669
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

696
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:42,758
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

697
02:19:42,883 --> 02:19:45,010
Just a man.

698
02:19:46,386 --> 02:19:48,638
An ancient race.

699
02:19:54,352 --> 02:19:59,274
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

700
02:19:59,399 --> 02:20:01,526
The future don't matter to us.

701
02:20:01,651 --> 02:20:03,236
Nothing matters now.

702
02:20:03,361 --> 02:20:06,698
Not the land,
not the money, not the woman.

703
02:20:07,324 --> 02:20:09,367
I came here to see you.

704
02:20:11,661 --> 02:20:14,790
Cos I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

705
02:20:29,971 --> 02:20:32,808
Only at the point of dying.

706
02:20:35,685 --> 02:20:37,813
I know.

707
02:21:21,481 --> 02:21:25,110
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

708
02:21:26,153 --> 02:21:28,196
Put it there, please.

709
02:21:30,907 --> 02:21:34,536
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

710
02:21:40,709 --> 02:21:42,085
You know what?

711
02:21:43,837 --> 02:21:47,799
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

712
02:21:56,391 --> 02:21:59,269
You can't imagine

713
02:21:59,394 --> 02:22:03,148
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

714
02:22:04,941 --> 02:22:07,235
Just to look at her.

715
02:22:10,405 --> 02:22:14,117
And if one of them
should pat your behind,...

716
02:22:15,702 --> 02:22:18,371
..just make believe it's nothing.

717
02:22:21,041 --> 02:22:23,210
They earned it.

718
02:26:57,109 --> 02:26:59,402
Keep your loving brother happy.

719
02:30:18,643 --> 02:30:20,645
Who are you?

720
02:31:30,674 --> 02:31:32,384
You're sort of a handsome man.

721
02:31:35,595 --> 02:31:37,597
But I'm not the right man.

722
02:31:50,527 --> 02:31:52,404
And neither is he.

723
02:31:55,031 --> 02:31:57,033
Maybe not.

724
02:31:57,159 --> 02:31:59,244
But it doesn't matter.

725
02:32:02,831 --> 02:32:05,625
You don't understand, Jill.

726
02:32:06,251 --> 02:32:09,129
People like that
have something inside.

727
02:32:11,798 --> 02:32:14,009
Something to do with death.

728
02:32:17,971 --> 02:32:22,058
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

729
02:32:22,184 --> 02:32:25,312
pick up his gear and say adis.

730
02:32:30,734 --> 02:32:33,987
It would be nice
to see this town grow.

731
02:34:05,203 --> 02:34:07,539
Now I gotta go.

732
02:34:52,876 --> 02:34:56,171
Gonna be a beautiful town,
Sweetwater.

733
02:35:01,134 --> 02:35:03,470
I hope you'll come back someday.

734
02:35:21,238 --> 02:35:23,073
Someday.

735
02:35:34,835 --> 02:35:38,505
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

736
02:36:04,698 --> 02:36:06,783
Make believe it's nothing.

737
02:38:12,367 --> 02:38:14,411
Sorry, Harmonica.

738
02:38:14,536 --> 02:38:16,496
I gotta stay here.

739
02:38:54,743 --> 02:38:56,203
Who?

740
02:38:59,498 --> 02:39:02,084
I ran into Mr Choo-Choo.

741
02:39:02,959 --> 02:39:06,338
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

742
02:39:07,214 --> 02:39:09,132
He got scared.

743
02:39:27,442 --> 02:39:29,402
Harmonica.

744
02:39:30,362 --> 02:39:32,406
When they do you in,

745
02:39:32,531 --> 02:39:35,450
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

746
02:39:51,133 --> 02:39:52,300
Go away.

747
02:39:54,719 --> 02:39:57,180
Go away.

748
02:39:57,305 --> 02:40:00,308
Go away.
I don't want you to see me die.
