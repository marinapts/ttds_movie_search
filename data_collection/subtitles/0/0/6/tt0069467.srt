1
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:21,962
It is early Monday morning...

2
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,770
and I am in pain.

3
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,325
My sisters...

4
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:47,490
and Anna...

5
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:53,401
are taking turns
staying up.

6
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,714
Good morning.

7
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:42,219
- Did anything happen?
- No, she's been very quiet.

8
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:45,380
- Thank you.
- I fell asleep.

9
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:17,421
Anna, see to the fire.

10
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,690
I thank Thee, dear Lord
for allowing me...

11
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:36,192
to awaken well and cheerful
this morning...

12
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,195
after a good sleep
under Thy protection...

13
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:43,199
and for the enjoyment
of a restful night.

14
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,031
I beseech Thee also
today and each day...

15
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:50,403
to let the angels watch over
and protect my little girl...

16
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:53,204
whom Thou in Thy unfathomable
wisdom tookest unto Thyself...

17
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:57,213
in Thy homeland.
Amen.

18
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:03,976
Mother is in my thoughts
nearly every day...

19
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:08,144
although she's been dead
for over 20 years.

20
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,312
I remember
she would often seek...

21
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:13,618
the solitude and peace
of the grounds.

22
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:17,627
I also remember that I would
follow her at a distance...

23
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,290
and spy on her
without really meaning to...

24
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:26,029
because I loved her
to such a jealous extreme.

25
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:28,094
I loved her because
she was so gentle...

26
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:30,800
and beautiful and alive...

27
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,969
and so all-pervadingly
present.

28
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:37,480
But she could also be cold,
playfully cruel...

29
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:40,574
and rebuff me.

30
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:44,143
Yet I could not help
feeling sorry for her...

31
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:48,487
and now that I'm older,
I understand her much better.

32
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,153
I wish I could
see her again...

33
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,458
to tell her
what I understand...

34
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,830
of her boredom,
her impatience...

35
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:00,837
her longing
and her loneliness.

36
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:13,744
And when the wicked witch
at last realized...

37
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,808
that little Gretel
had tricked her...

38
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:19,652
her nose started
to grow and grow.

39
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:23,659
At Twelfth Night
Mother always gave a party...

40
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,991
and Aunt Olga would come
with her magic lantern...

41
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:27,997
and her fairy tales.

42
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:30,329
I always felt frightened
and left out.

43
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:32,995
When Mother spoke to me
in her hurried way...

44
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,005
I could hardly understand
what she wanted of me.

45
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:40,669
Mother and Maria always had
many things to whisper about...

46
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,678
but then they were so alike.

47
00:14:42,746 --> 00:14:46,341
Jealously I used to wonder what
they were laughing at together.

48
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:49,284
Everyone was in gay spirits.

49
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:52,686
I was the only one who couldn't
join in the merriment.

50
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:56,192
Another time,
I remember it was autumn...

51
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,660
I hid behind the curtain...

52
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,663
and in secret watched her.

53
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:05,566
She was in the red drawing room
wearing her white dress...

54
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:07,570
sitting quite still
with her head bent...

55
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:10,198
and her hands resting
on the table.

56
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,208
Suddenly she saw me...

57
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:14,676
and in a gentle voice
called me.

58
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:18,704
- Come.
- Uncertain, I went up to her...

59
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:23,549
thinking that, as usual,
she was going to scold me.

60
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:34,062
But instead she gave me
a look so full of sorrow...

61
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:38,568
that I nearly
burst into tears.

62
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:45,735
I raised my hand
and put it against her cheek...

63
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:50,075
and for that moment
we were very close.

64
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,775
There's someone out there.

65
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:26,115
Anna.

66
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:28,549
There's someone out there.

67
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:40,296
Good morning, Agnes.

68
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,133
Good morning, Doctor.

69
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:25,964
She is very tired now.
I don't think it will be long.

70
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:28,869
Thank you.
I know the way.

71
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,643
David!

72
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,215
It's been so long.

73
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:50,219
When can I see you again?

74
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:41,470
No!

75
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:27,816
Some years earlier...

76
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,819
when Agnes had gone to Italy
for her health...

77
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:36,325
Maria and her husband, Joakim,
were staying at the manor.

78
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:39,487
One evening, Anna's
little daughter was taken ill...

79
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:41,656
and Maria sent
for the family doctor...

80
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,757
who lived in the nearby
country town.

81
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,826
- Now say "ah."
- Ah.

82
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:49,667
- Once again.
- Ah.

83
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,004
That hurt a little?
I can see that.

84
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:55,169
What a good girl.
That wasn't too bad, eh?

85
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:57,179
Off to bed with you now.

86
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:00,512
You'll feel better
after a good night's sleep.

87
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:10,856
- Thank you.
- Doctor, are you hungry?

88
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:14,021
If you'd like a little supper
the table's being prepared.

89
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:17,032
Oh yes, that would be nice.

90
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,034
Thank you.

91
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,225
Agnes and Karin are still
traveling in Italy.

92
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:46,057
I received a letter
from them last week.

93
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:48,222
Agnes is much better.

94
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,732
- Her cough is entirely gone.
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:54,897
And she's picked up
her painting again.

96
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:58,407
Karin's husband decided
to join them at Easter.

97
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,409
They've been having
good weather.

98
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:04,072
It's like summer, even though
the nights are chilly.

99
00:23:04,147 --> 00:23:06,081
Your husband, he's well?

100
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,743
Joakim, he had some business
in town this evening...

101
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:11,913
and won't be back
'til tomorrow.

102
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:14,081
I told him I would ask you
to come here to look in...

103
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,591
on Anna's little girl.

104
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,096
- He sends his best regards.
- Thank you.

105
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,432
Anna's been told
to get the guest room ready.

106
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,438
The weather's so awful.

107
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:33,442
I don't think you ought
to go home on such a night.

108
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:39,782
- You've changed a lot.
- Really? Oh.

109
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,444
Is there anyone else?

110
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,783
Isn't there always?

111
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:48,791
I never would have thought
the problem could interest you.

112
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,793
Nor does it.

113
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:04,707
Hmm?

114
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:12,807
Do you wear spectacles
all the time now?

115
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:26,161
- Am I bothering you?
- No, it's all right.

116
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:49,318
Why are you so formal?

117
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:55,153
Couldn't you let the past
be forgotten?

118
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:03,832
Come here, Marie.

119
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,334
Come.

120
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:11,169
Look at yourself
in the mirror.

121
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:13,300
You're beautiful.

122
00:25:13,376 --> 00:25:17,005
You are probably
more beautiful now than before.

123
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,344
But you have changed
a lot too.

124
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,344
I want you to see
how you've changed.

125
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,516
Now your eyes cast quick,
calculating side glances.

126
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:30,025
You used to look ahead
straightforwardly...

127
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:34,359
openly, unmasked.

128
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:38,197
Your mouth has taken on
an expression of discontent...

129
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:40,202
and hunger.

130
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,536
It used to be so soft.

131
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:49,045
Your complexion is pale now.
You use makeup.

132
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,376
Your fine, broad forehead...

133
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,882
now has four wrinkles
above each brow.

134
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,885
No, you can't see it
in this light...

135
00:25:56,953 --> 00:25:59,717
but you can
in broad daylight.

136
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:02,223
Do you know what
caused those wrinkles?

137
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:05,887
- No.
- Indifference, Marie.

138
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:13,569
And this fine line
that runs from ear to chin...

139
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:16,902
is not as obvious any more...

140
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:21,910
but it is etched there by
your easygoing, indolent ways.

141
00:26:21,978 --> 00:26:24,913
And there,
by the bridge of your nose.

142
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:29,247
Why do you sneer
so often, Marie?

143
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,085
You see it?
You sneer too often.

144
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:35,590
See, Marie?

145
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:37,593
And look under your eyes.

146
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:40,255
The sharp,
scarcely noticeable lines...

147
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:44,596
of your impatience
and your ennui.

148
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,432
Can you actually see
all of that in my face?

149
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:49,768
No, but I feel it
when you kiss me.

150
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,774
I think
you're joking with me.

151
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:54,935
It's evident
where you see it.

152
00:26:55,011 --> 00:26:58,276
- Really? Where?
- You see it in yourself.

153
00:26:58,348 --> 00:27:01,784
Because we're so alike,
you and I.

154
00:27:01,851 --> 00:27:05,947
You mean the selfishness?

155
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:10,118
Coldness? Unconcern?

156
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,296
I usually find
your arguments boring.

157
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:25,933
Is there no absolution
for such as you and I?

158
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:30,002
I haven't any need
of being pardoned.

159
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:35,643
Good morning, sir.

160
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,653
Good morning.

161
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,535
Thank you.

162
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:01,043
Good morning, Joakim.

163
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:04,274
- Welcome home.
- Good morning, Maria.

164
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:06,542
Anna's little girl
is quite ill, you know.

165
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:08,709
The doctor
was here last night.

166
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:10,719
He sends you his regards...

167
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:15,383
and hopes you can get together
to play chess again.

168
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:19,394
The weather was so bad
I asked him to stay overnight.

169
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:23,796
He left early this morning
before we were up.

170
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:31,202
Did you enjoy yourself in town
or was there too much work?

171
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:36,077
We have an invitation
from the Egermans.

172
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:39,081
They'd be delighted if we
stayed with them at Easter.

173
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:41,913
I think I would enjoy that.

174
00:28:41,985 --> 00:28:44,419
It would make for a change.

175
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:47,923
What do you think about it?

176
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:53,261
Well, we'll see.

177
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,790
Run along and play.

178
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,001
Joakim.

179
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:14,900
Joakim.

180
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:24,011
Help me.

181
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:35,193
Help me, please.

182
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,053
No.

183
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:03,451
Anna.

184
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:14,129
Do you hear?

185
00:32:14,197 --> 00:32:19,635
I only hear the wind
and the clocks ticking.

186
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:22,637
No, it's something else.

187
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:25,970
I don't hear anything else.

188
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:31,638
I'm freezing.

189
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,486
Good night.

190
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:56,500
Anna.

191
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:58,665
Come here.

192
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,680
Anna.

193
00:33:05,748 --> 00:33:08,683
Come to me.

194
00:33:17,427 --> 00:33:20,191
You're so far away.

195
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:26,034
Come here.

196
00:33:26,102 --> 00:33:28,036
Close to me.

197
00:33:44,454 --> 00:33:46,888
Do I smell very bad?

198
00:33:58,568 --> 00:34:02,060
- It hurts so much, Anna.
- I know, Agnes.

199
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:04,572
I'm going to stay with you.

200
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:10,408
- It will all be all right.
- It hurts so badly.

201
00:34:22,992 --> 00:34:25,586
You don't have to worry
when I'm here.

202
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:27,925
You know that.

203
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,927
The pillow's so warm.

204
00:34:34,003 --> 00:34:36,437
We can take the other one.

205
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:39,475
Come. Let's see.

206
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:43,273
Can you lift yourself up
a little?

207
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:51,953
Can you slide down now?

208
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:58,289
Is it better so?

209
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,454
Is it better?

210
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,465
You are so good to me.

211
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:28,315
Yes?
What's the matter?

212
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:32,156
Agnes is worse.

213
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:46,841
I don't think she's conscious.

214
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:49,673
She's breathing very strangely.

215
00:35:49,745 --> 00:35:52,509
I'll get my shawl.

216
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:11,366
Karin!

217
00:36:12,602 --> 00:36:14,536
- Karin!
- What is it?

218
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:18,040
- Agnes is worse.
- I'm coming.

219
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:58,242
- I'll go for the doctor.
- I'll go with you.

220
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:43,788
Anna! Anna! Anna!

221
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:55,462
- Where's the doctor?
- He wasn't home.

222
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:57,472
All right, Anna.
You had better get dressed.

223
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,633
I'll stay with her.

224
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:01,802
Anna!

225
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:47,184
I'm much better now.

226
00:38:47,256 --> 00:38:49,850
Only rather warm.

227
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:51,859
Would you like
to have a wash now?

228
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:56,023
- And put on a clean gown?
- Yes, thank you.

229
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:34,962
- I'm a little thirsty.
- Yes, of course.

230
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:56,811
- Shall I read a little?
- Oh, I'd love it.

231
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:14,499
"Chapter 34, in which
Mr. Pickwick thinks...

232
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:18,301
"he had better go to Bath,
and goes accordingly.

233
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:21,343
"'But surely, my dear sir,'
said little Perker...

234
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,344
"as he stood
in Mr. Pickwick's apartment...

235
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:25,505
"on the morning
after the trial.

236
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:28,516
"'Surely you don't really mean,
really and seriously now...

237
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:30,518
"'and irritation apart...

238
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:32,679
"'that you won't pay
these costs and damages? '

239
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,519
"'Not one halfpenny,'
said Mr. Pickwick firmly.

240
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:37,616
"'Not one halfpenny.'

241
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:41,026
"'Hooray for the principle,
as the moneylender said...

242
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:43,121
"'when he wouldn't
renew the bill'...

243
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,033
"observed Mr. Weller, who
was clearing away breakfast.

244
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:49,036
"'Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick...

245
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:51,368
"'have the goodness
to step downstairs.'

246
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,704
"'Certainly, sir,'
replied Mr. Weller...

247
00:41:53,776 --> 00:41:58,713
"and acting on Mr. Pickwick's
gentle hint, Sam retired."

248
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,770
Anna!

249
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:16,287
Can't anyone...
Can't anyone help me?

250
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:18,292
I can't!

251
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,456
Help me!

252
00:43:56,398 --> 00:43:58,332
I can't.

253
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:51,537
God, our Father,
in His infinite wisdom...

254
00:47:51,608 --> 00:47:53,872
has called you home to Him...

255
00:47:53,944 --> 00:47:57,710
still in the bloom
of your youth.

256
00:47:57,781 --> 00:48:00,875
In your life
He found you worthy...

257
00:48:00,951 --> 00:48:05,217
of bearing a long
and torturous agony.

258
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:09,055
You submitted to it patiently
and without complaint...

259
00:48:09,126 --> 00:48:12,220
in the certain knowledge that
your sins would be forgiven...

260
00:48:12,296 --> 00:48:17,063
through the death on the cross
of your Lord, Jesus Christ.

261
00:48:17,134 --> 00:48:19,568
May your Father in Heaven...

262
00:48:19,636 --> 00:48:22,230
when you step
into His presence...

263
00:48:22,306 --> 00:48:25,400
have mercy on your soul.

264
00:48:25,475 --> 00:48:29,241
May He let His angels
remove from you the memory...

265
00:48:29,313 --> 00:48:31,247
of your earthly pain.

266
00:48:56,306 --> 00:48:58,433
Should it be...

267
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:00,942
that you gathered up
our suffering in agony...

268
00:49:01,011 --> 00:49:02,945
into your body.

269
00:49:03,013 --> 00:49:04,947
Should it be
you bore with you...

270
00:49:05,015 --> 00:49:06,949
this hardship
through death.

271
00:49:07,017 --> 00:49:09,451
Should it be
that you meet with God...

272
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:12,283
as you come to that
other land.

273
00:49:12,356 --> 00:49:14,620
Should it be that
you find his countenance...

274
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:16,625
turned toward you then.

275
00:49:16,693 --> 00:49:19,958
Should it be that you know
the language to speak...

276
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,295
so this God may hear
and understand.

277
00:49:23,367 --> 00:49:25,631
Should it be that you then
talk with this God...

278
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:27,966
and he hear you out.

279
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:30,973
Should it be so...

280
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:33,475
pray for us.

281
00:49:33,543 --> 00:49:35,977
Agnes, dear child,
please listen.

282
00:49:36,046 --> 00:49:38,139
Listen to what
I have to tell you now.

283
00:49:38,215 --> 00:49:40,649
Pray for us who
have been left in darkness...

284
00:49:40,717 --> 00:49:43,151
left behind
on this miserable Earth...

285
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,815
with the sky above us,
grim and empty.

286
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,824
Lay your burden
at God's feet...

287
00:49:48,892 --> 00:49:50,826
the whole
of all your suffering...

288
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:53,988
and plead with Him
to pardon us.

289
00:49:54,064 --> 00:49:56,828
Plead with Him
that He may free us...

290
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,837
of our anxiety
and of our weariness...

291
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:04,339
of our misgivings
and fears.

292
00:50:04,408 --> 00:50:06,342
Plead with Him
that He may make...

293
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,345
sense and meaning
of our lives.

294
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:11,677
Agnes, you who have borne...

295
00:50:11,748 --> 00:50:14,683
your anguish and suffering
so long...

296
00:50:14,751 --> 00:50:17,185
are most surely worthy...

297
00:50:17,254 --> 00:50:21,350
of advocating our cause.

298
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:29,865
She was my confirmation child.

299
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:35,701
We often had talks together
through the many years.

300
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:39,208
Her faith was stronger
than mine.

301
00:50:51,288 --> 00:50:53,882
If you don't mind,
I could see you tomorrow...

302
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:56,721
and we can discuss
the formalities of the funeral.

303
00:50:56,793 --> 00:50:58,727
Thank you.

304
00:51:50,847 --> 00:51:54,783
Some years earlier, Karin
and her husband Fredrik...

305
00:51:54,851 --> 00:51:57,445
were pursuing
a diplomatic career.

306
00:51:57,521 --> 00:51:59,785
During a visit
to their native land...

307
00:51:59,856 --> 00:52:02,791
they stayed for some months
at the manor.

308
00:52:05,362 --> 00:52:08,798
Please, Anna, may I have
a little more fish?

309
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:23,039
- Won't you keep me company?
- No, thank you.

310
00:52:48,738 --> 00:52:52,572
- What are you smiling about?
- I'm not smiling.

311
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:37,617
Do you want coffee or are we
going to retire immediately?

312
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:40,178
I don't want coffee.
Thank you.

313
00:54:30,507 --> 00:54:34,500
It's late.
I suggest we retire now.

314
00:55:09,746 --> 00:55:13,204
It's but a tissue of lies.
All of it.

315
00:55:35,271 --> 00:55:37,705
Don't look at me!

316
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:48,884
Don't look at me
like that, I say!

317
00:55:53,623 --> 00:55:56,319
Sorry.

318
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:04,289
Forgive me.

319
00:56:10,473 --> 00:56:13,135
Help me to undress.

320
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,374
You may go.

321
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:45,720
It's but a tissue of lies.

322
00:58:45,795 --> 00:58:49,060
It's a monumental
tissue of lies.

323
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:54,236
Tissue of lies.

324
01:01:41,237 --> 01:01:43,398
- What are you doing?
- Going through documents...

325
01:01:43,473 --> 01:01:47,068
books and papers
concerning the estate.

326
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:52,740
Karin, I want us
to be friends.

327
01:01:52,815 --> 01:01:56,251
I want us to talk
to each other.

328
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,253
After all, we're sisters.

329
01:01:58,321 --> 01:02:01,586
We have so many
of the same memories.

330
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:05,593
Karin, it's so strange how
we don't reach one another...

331
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:08,755
how we only make small talk.

332
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,097
Karin, why won't you
be my friend?

333
01:02:16,172 --> 01:02:19,437
We've both been
happy and unhappy.

334
01:02:19,509 --> 01:02:21,773
We could laugh and cry
together.

335
01:02:21,844 --> 01:02:26,781
We could talk together
for days and nights on end.

336
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:29,477
We could put our arms
around each other.

337
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:31,952
Karin?

338
01:02:34,524 --> 01:02:37,618
I wander through
our childhood home sometimes...

339
01:02:37,693 --> 01:02:41,789
where all is at once
strange but familiar...

340
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:46,301
and it seems
I am in a dream...

341
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:50,965
and an event of great importance
is in store for us.

342
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:58,806
Yes, I know I am childish.

343
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:02,476
You read much more than I do,
think much more than I do.

344
01:03:02,552 --> 01:03:05,988
Your experience is far greater.

345
01:03:09,058 --> 01:03:12,494
Karin, couldn't we devote
these days...

346
01:03:12,562 --> 01:03:15,497
to getting to know
each other finally?

347
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:18,500
To coming closer together?

348
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:25,507
I can't stand to be silent
and distant, Karin.

349
01:03:25,575 --> 01:03:28,840
Karin, have I said something
to hurt you?

350
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:32,347
It's easy to do, but I didn't
mean to hurt your feelings.

351
01:03:32,415 --> 01:03:34,508
Karin!

352
01:04:02,111 --> 01:04:04,204
What are you reading?

353
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,545
- I'm reading Agnes' diary.
- A diary?

354
01:04:07,617 --> 01:04:10,211
"Thursday, September 30."

355
01:04:10,286 --> 01:04:14,222
She's written, "I received
the most wonderful gift...

356
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,724
"anyone can receive
in this life.

357
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:20,159
"A gift that is called
many things: Togetherness...

358
01:04:20,229 --> 01:04:25,223
"companionship, relatedness,
affection.

359
01:04:25,301 --> 01:04:28,896
"I think this is
what is called 'grace.'"

360
01:04:31,974 --> 01:04:35,410
No, don't touch me!
Don't come near me!

361
01:04:36,746 --> 01:04:40,238
I can't stand
anyone touching me.

362
01:05:53,389 --> 01:05:57,655
I don't want you to do that.

363
01:05:57,727 --> 01:06:00,491
I don't want it.

364
01:06:00,563 --> 01:06:05,000
I don't want you
to be kind to me.

365
01:06:17,913 --> 01:06:22,009
I can't!
I can't stand it!

366
01:06:22,084 --> 01:06:24,348
Constant torture.

367
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:27,184
It's like being
in the greatest hell.

368
01:06:27,256 --> 01:06:29,690
I can't breathe any longer.

369
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,193
All of that guilt.

370
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:41,035
No!

371
01:06:46,609 --> 01:06:50,204
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

372
01:06:50,279 --> 01:06:52,443
Don't touch me.

373
01:06:52,615 --> 01:06:54,749
Don't touch me.

374
01:06:55,117 --> 01:06:57,051
Don't touch me.

375
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:02,056
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

376
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:05,389
I am sorry I lost control
of myself this morning.

377
01:07:05,461 --> 01:07:07,554
I don't know what came over me.

378
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:12,067
I suppose it's all the emotion
concerning Agnes' death.

379
01:07:12,134 --> 01:07:16,070
We were so fond of her.
Now that the funeral is over...

380
01:07:16,138 --> 01:07:19,073
I'll have our lawyer look after
all the legal formalities.

381
01:07:19,141 --> 01:07:21,200
The fruit please, Anna.

382
01:07:21,277 --> 01:07:24,576
It's best we sell
the house and grounds.

383
01:07:24,647 --> 01:07:27,582
You and I can divide up
all the rest of it.

384
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,743
I mean, the furniture
and other things...

385
01:07:29,819 --> 01:07:32,754
like china, silverware,
books and pictures.

386
01:07:32,822 --> 01:07:35,586
All right, Anna,
that will be all now.

387
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:47,431
What shall we do about Anna?

388
01:07:47,503 --> 01:07:49,596
I suggest
that we give her notice...

389
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:52,436
and a few weeks extra pay.

390
01:07:52,508 --> 01:07:54,772
And also a little article
of Agnes'.

391
01:07:54,844 --> 01:07:57,438
She was quite devoted.

392
01:07:57,513 --> 01:08:00,949
The fact of it is that
they were very attached.

393
01:08:01,016 --> 01:08:04,611
Now she trails after us
in much too familiar a manner.

394
01:08:04,687 --> 01:08:06,678
I don't think...

395
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:18,295
It's true.

396
01:08:18,367 --> 01:08:21,962
I think...

397
01:08:22,037 --> 01:08:25,973
about suicide.

398
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:29,477
I've often thought about it.

399
01:08:29,545 --> 01:08:31,809
It's...

400
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:35,647
It's disgusting.

401
01:08:35,718 --> 01:08:39,654
It's very degrading...

402
01:08:39,722 --> 01:08:45,160
and everlastingly the same.

403
01:09:01,577 --> 01:09:06,037
Henrik's an excellent lawyer,
I assure you.

404
01:09:15,257 --> 01:09:18,522
My husband says
that I'm clumsy.

405
01:09:18,594 --> 01:09:20,528
He's right.

406
01:09:20,596 --> 01:09:22,860
I fumble.

407
01:09:22,932 --> 01:09:26,368
My hands are too large,
you understand.

408
01:09:26,435 --> 01:09:29,029
Most disobedient.

409
01:09:48,457 --> 01:09:52,052
You look so disconcerted.

410
01:09:52,127 --> 01:09:55,722
You thought our talk
would be different, didn't you?

411
01:09:59,802 --> 01:10:02,566
Do you realize I hate you?

412
01:10:02,638 --> 01:10:04,731
And how foolish I find
your insipid smiles...

413
01:10:04,807 --> 01:10:08,243
and your idiotic
flirtatiousness.

414
01:10:11,814 --> 01:10:14,248
How have I managed
to tolerate you so long...

415
01:10:14,316 --> 01:10:17,911
and not say anything?

416
01:10:17,987 --> 01:10:20,581
I know of what you're made...

417
01:10:20,656 --> 01:10:26,094
with your empty caresses
and your false promises.

418
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:32,095
Can you conceive how anybody
can live with so much hate...

419
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:34,431
as has been my burden?

420
01:10:34,503 --> 01:10:38,098
There's no relief,
no charity, no help.

421
01:10:38,173 --> 01:10:40,607
There is nothing.

422
01:10:44,013 --> 01:10:47,278
You understand?
Nothing can escape me...

423
01:10:47,349 --> 01:10:50,944
for I see it all.

424
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,466
Now you hear how it sounds
when Karin talks.

425
01:11:18,213 --> 01:11:20,647
You sit there grinning
your cold little grin.

426
01:11:20,716 --> 01:11:22,684
What are you thinking?

427
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:26,482
Would you care to tell me?

428
01:11:26,555 --> 01:11:28,989
May I have your opinion?

429
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:34,655
No!
That's just what I thought.

430
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:37,665
You'd rather stay silent.

431
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:41,169
And you are right, Maria!

432
01:12:13,936 --> 01:12:18,202
Maria! Forgive me.

433
01:12:19,942 --> 01:12:23,708
Maybe you mean well.

434
01:12:23,779 --> 01:12:27,374
Maybe you just
want to know me better.

435
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:30,213
Maria, dear, forgive me.

436
01:12:30,285 --> 01:12:34,881
I do run on and on.

437
01:12:34,957 --> 01:12:39,053
No.
No, that's not true either.

438
01:12:39,128 --> 01:12:43,064
Maria, look at me.

439
01:12:44,633 --> 01:12:47,568
Maria, look at me.

440
01:15:05,774 --> 01:15:09,710
Don't you hear it?

441
01:15:09,778 --> 01:15:13,214
Don't you hear the crying?
Don't you hear it?

442
01:15:13,282 --> 01:15:15,876
Someone is crying endlessly.

443
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:07,158
- Are you afraid of me now?
- No, not in the least.

444
01:17:07,229 --> 01:17:09,663
I'm dead, you see.

445
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:14,498
The trouble is
I can't get to sleep.

446
01:17:14,569 --> 01:17:17,003
I can't leave you all.

447
01:17:20,242 --> 01:17:23,507
I'm so tired.

448
01:17:23,578 --> 01:17:27,344
Can't anyone help me?

449
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:32,683
- It's but a dream, Agnes.
- No, it's not a dream.

450
01:17:32,754 --> 01:17:36,349
Perhaps for you it's a dream...

451
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:38,689
but not for me.

452
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,196
I want Karin to come here.

453
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:52,698
Agnes wants Karin
to come to her.

454
01:18:05,954 --> 01:18:10,550
Can't you hold my hands
and warm me?

455
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:15,722
Stay with me
until the horror is over.

456
01:18:15,797 --> 01:18:20,734
It's so empty all around me.

457
01:18:32,147 --> 01:18:37,585
Nobody would do what you ask.
I'm still alive.

458
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:40,746
I won't accept involvement
with your death.

459
01:18:45,994 --> 01:18:51,432
Perchance, if I had loved you...

460
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:55,095
but I do not love you.

461
01:18:57,172 --> 01:18:59,106
What you ask me to do
is repulsive.

462
01:18:59,174 --> 01:19:03,110
I'm leaving you now.
In a few hours I'll be gone.

463
01:19:15,023 --> 01:19:19,119
- Anna.
- Yes.

464
01:19:21,029 --> 01:19:24,123
I want Maria to come.

465
01:19:42,551 --> 01:19:45,816
Agnes wants Maria to come in.

466
01:20:29,931 --> 01:20:32,866
Don't be afraid.

467
01:20:32,934 --> 01:20:36,370
Please touch me.

468
01:20:36,438 --> 01:20:39,703
Please talk with me.

469
01:20:39,774 --> 01:20:43,369
Hold my hands and warm me.

470
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:48,712
You are my sister.
I don't want you to be alone.

471
01:20:48,783 --> 01:20:53,220
Oh, how sorry I am for you.

472
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:58,392
Do you recall
when we were small...

473
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,394
and twilight came
as we played...

474
01:21:00,462 --> 01:21:04,057
and both of us
became frightened...

475
01:21:04,132 --> 01:21:09,900
and we'd cuddle very close
and hold each other tight.

476
01:21:09,971 --> 01:21:13,236
It's simply the same thing now,
isn't it?

477
01:21:13,308 --> 01:21:16,243
I can't hear
what you're saying.

478
01:21:16,311 --> 01:21:19,906
You must come closer to me.

479
01:21:21,983 --> 01:21:25,749
Closer.

480
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,755
Hold my hands.

481
01:22:41,429 --> 01:22:46,696
I'll stay with you.
I'll stay here.

482
01:22:46,768 --> 01:22:48,702
Don't cry.

483
01:23:06,755 --> 01:23:09,918
You needn't be afraid.
I'll stay by her.

484
01:23:09,991 --> 01:23:12,516
There's my daughter
I must think about.

485
01:23:12,594 --> 01:23:16,030
She must realize that.
Also, my husband needs me.

486
01:23:16,097 --> 01:23:19,032
It's pure morbidity,
disgusting, meaningless.

487
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,034
She's already begun to rot.

488
01:23:21,102 --> 01:23:23,662
She has foul spots
on her hands.

489
01:23:23,738 --> 01:23:25,672
I'll take care of her.

490
01:24:14,422 --> 01:24:18,188
The funeral was tolerable.
No one wept or grew hysterical.

491
01:24:18,259 --> 01:24:20,523
Thank you.
Have you finished packing, Anna?

492
01:24:20,595 --> 01:24:22,563
I just have to bring
the last trunk down, ma'am.

493
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,564
Hurry up.
We are pressed for time.

494
01:24:24,632 --> 01:24:29,467
The music was fine. Thankfully,
the bishop's address was short.

495
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:32,836
Fortunate that he had a chill
so we could call off the dinner.

496
01:24:32,907 --> 01:24:36,035
Hadn't something
better be done for Anna?

497
01:24:36,111 --> 01:24:38,545
Sorry, but I don't understand
what you mean.

498
01:24:38,613 --> 01:24:40,706
She's looked after Agnes
for the last 12 years.

499
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:42,716
Shouldn't we offer her
a small sum...

500
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:44,718
or help her find a new place?

501
01:24:44,786 --> 01:24:47,220
Out of the question.
She's young and strong...

502
01:24:47,288 --> 01:24:49,552
and has had it very easy
up until now.

503
01:24:49,624 --> 01:24:51,751
Her future
is not our responsibility.

504
01:24:51,826 --> 01:24:54,056
I did promise her she could
take a memento with her.

505
01:24:54,129 --> 01:24:56,825
- Of her own choosing?
- I think she has that right.

506
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:59,389
I do detest
that sort of spontaneity...

507
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:02,027
but you can't renege.

508
01:25:02,103 --> 01:25:05,072
I think we should
speak to her right away.

509
01:25:12,981 --> 01:25:17,247
Anna, you may stay on here
for a time if it is necessary.

510
01:25:17,318 --> 01:25:21,755
You were promised
a memento of Agnes'.

511
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:31,924
Thank you.
I want nothing at all.

512
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,560
She's trying
to play a nice role.

513
01:25:34,636 --> 01:25:37,628
But she won't
get anything for it.

514
01:25:37,705 --> 01:25:41,937
- Stay 'til the month's end.
- Yes.

515
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:45,104
Well, if there's nothing left
for us to attend to.

516
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:49,913
Let's leave before the roads
to the station are snowed under.

517
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:54,120
Good-bye now, Anna.
Thank you.

518
01:25:56,858 --> 01:25:58,792
Thank you.

519
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:03,956
Thank you for all you did.

520
01:26:26,988 --> 01:26:29,422
Hurry now.

521
01:26:43,605 --> 01:26:46,836
- Could I speak to you a second?
- Of course.

522
01:26:48,877 --> 01:26:51,846
That evening we came close
to each other...

523
01:26:51,913 --> 01:26:53,847
have you thought
about what we discussed?

524
01:26:53,915 --> 01:26:56,247
Yes, of course,
I've thought a lot about it.

525
01:26:56,317 --> 01:26:58,877
Could we hold
to all of our resolutions?

526
01:26:58,953 --> 01:27:01,046
Dearest Karin, why on earth
shouldn't we do that?

527
01:27:01,122 --> 01:27:04,523
I have no idea.

528
01:27:04,592 --> 01:27:06,992
It's that everything seems
different since that evening.

529
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:10,861
I think we've become
very much closer.

530
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:17,863
What are you thinking about?

531
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:20,066
I'm thinking
about the conversation...

532
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:22,701
- No, you're not.
- I was thinking how Joakim...

533
01:27:22,777 --> 01:27:25,541
hates it
if I keep him waiting.

534
01:27:25,613 --> 01:27:27,706
I have no idea
why you call me to account...

535
01:27:27,782 --> 01:27:31,718
as if I were on trial
for my thoughts, Karin.

536
01:27:31,786 --> 01:27:34,721
What do you want?

537
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:41,888
- Nothing.
- No.

538
01:27:41,963 --> 01:27:43,897
If there's nothing you want,
don't be hurt...

539
01:27:43,965 --> 01:27:46,365
because I must say good-bye
to you now.

540
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:58,305
You touched me.
Don't you remember that?

541
01:27:58,379 --> 01:28:01,246
I don't recall
each stupid act...

542
01:28:01,316 --> 01:28:06,015
and never try forcing me
to answer for one.

543
01:28:09,657 --> 01:28:12,922
Dearest Karin, give the children
my love and keep well.

544
01:28:12,994 --> 01:28:16,259
'Til Twelfth Night.
As usual, we'll meet then.

545
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:21,965
How sad.

546
01:29:14,756 --> 01:29:19,193
"Wednesday,
the third of September.

547
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:22,696
"The tang of autumn
fills the clear, still air...

548
01:29:22,764 --> 01:29:26,530
"but it's mild and fine."

549
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:31,368
My sisters, Karin and Maria,
have come to see me.

550
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:33,999
It's wonderful
to be together again...

551
01:29:34,075 --> 01:29:39,206
like in the old days,
and I am feeling much better.

552
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,044
We were even able to go
for a little walk together...

553
01:29:42,116 --> 01:29:44,550
such an event for me...

554
01:29:44,619 --> 01:29:49,556
especially since I haven't
been out of doors for so long.

555
01:29:52,126 --> 01:29:55,562
Suddenly we began to laugh
and run toward the old swing...

556
01:29:55,630 --> 01:30:00,067
that we hadn't seen
since we were children.

557
01:30:00,134 --> 01:30:03,729
We sat in it like three
good little sisters...

558
01:30:03,805 --> 01:30:08,139
and Anna pushed us,
slowly and gently.

559
01:30:08,209 --> 01:30:12,407
All my aches and pains
were gone.

560
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:17,247
The people I am most fond of
in all the world were with me.

561
01:30:17,318 --> 01:30:20,412
I could hear their chatting
around me.

562
01:30:20,488 --> 01:30:22,922
I could feel the presence
of their bodies...

563
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:25,925
the warmth of their hands.

564
01:30:25,993 --> 01:30:29,429
I wanted to hold the moment fast
and thought:

565
01:30:29,497 --> 01:30:34,093
"Come what may,
this is happiness.

566
01:30:34,168 --> 01:30:37,433
"I cannot wish
for anything better.

567
01:30:37,505 --> 01:30:41,100
"Now, for a few minutes...

568
01:30:41,175 --> 01:30:44,611
"I can experience perfection.

569
01:30:44,679 --> 01:30:47,773
"And I feel profoundly grateful
to my life...

570
01:30:47,849 --> 01:30:50,283
"which gives me so much."
