1
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Jesus!

2
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,400
"To the city of San Francisco.
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

3
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,800
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

4
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

5
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,200
...at personal column,
San Francisco Chronicle...

6
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,700
...and I will set up meeting.
If I do not hear from you...

7
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,400
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a... . "

8
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,600
"Scorpio. "

9
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,300
What goes on in their minds?
Kooks.

10
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,300
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

11
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,100
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

12
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,100
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

13
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,400
Instead, we pay a police department.

14
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,700
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

15
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

16
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,300
Send Inspector Callahan in.

17
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,900
Callahan?

18
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,400
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.
All right.

19
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,200
Let's have it.

20
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,400
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

21
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,000
For the past 3/4 hour...
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

22
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,300
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

23
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,500
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

24
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,300
There's a madman loose.

25
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,600
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

26
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,700
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

27
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,500
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

28
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,500
...rifle nuts, peepers...
Mr. Mayor?

29
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,700
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

30
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,500
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

31
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,500
...and in the black area.
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

32
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,100
We're sure it's a 30-06.
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

33
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,900
We're running a computer check...

34
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,900
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

35
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,700
...October 23 and November 21.
Why?

36
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,200
Natives of Scorpio.

37
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,400
Thank you, Inspector.

38
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,400
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

39
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,200
How about you?

40
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,600
Nobody.

41
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?
Nobody.

42
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,900
All right. Give the message
to the Chronicle.

43
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,500
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

44
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,300
You'll play this creep's game?
It'll give us breathing space.

45
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,900
It might get somebody killed.

46
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

47
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,200
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

48
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

49
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,500
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

50
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,600
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

51
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,300
That's my policy.

52
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,400
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

53
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,900
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

54
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Intent?

55
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,900
How did you establish that?

56
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,800
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

57
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,600
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

58
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,900
I think he's got a point.

59
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,400
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

60
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,400
Usual.

61
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,300
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

62
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,600
What difference does it make?

63
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Not much.

64
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Hey, Jaffe...

65
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,300
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

66
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,900
Tan Ford?

67
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, tan Ford.
Engine running?

68
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,700
I don't know.
How can I tell?

69
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,600
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

70
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,700
Look at that pollution.

71
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Do me a favor, will you?

72
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,300
Call this telephone number.

73
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,000
Police Department?
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

74
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,400
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

75
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,400
Got it.

76
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,500
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

77
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,400
In progress.
Yes, sir.

78
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

79
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,200
Shit!

80
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Halt!

81
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,400
I know what you're thinking.

82
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,300
Did he fire six shots or only five?

83
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,500
To tell the truth, in all the excitement
I've kind of lost track myself.

84
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Since this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

85
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,300
...and would blow
your head clean off...

86
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,700
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

87
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
Well, do you, punk?

88
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,500
I got to know.

89
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Son of a bitch!

90
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,900
It looks like we can save that leg.

91
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,800
I've got a couple under my knee.
Ever consider
another line of work?

92
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,900
I really appreciate this, Steve.
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

93
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,900
Nothing fancy, now.

94
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,400
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

95
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,300
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

96
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,900
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

97
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,600
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a... .

98
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,900
Sorry, Harry.

99
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,700
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

100
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

101
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
For $29.50, let it hurt.

102
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

103
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,100
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Maria.

104
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,100
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

105
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,100
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?
Whenever you do.

106
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,500
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m.
checking the search patterns.

107
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,700
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

108
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,100
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

109
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,600
- He was?
- He wanted me to tell you: "Well done! "

110
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,700
I can't tell you how moved I am.
I pass along a compliment...

111
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,500
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

112
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,600
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

113
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,000
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

114
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

115
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,600
I'm putting somebody
with you.

116
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
What are you talking about?
You need a partner.

117
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

118
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,500
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

119
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,500
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.
I have no time to break in newcomers.

120
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,400
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

121
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,100
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

122
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,000
...and Fanduchi's dead.
So?

123
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,000
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.
What about De Georgio?

124
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,500
No way!

125
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

126
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,800
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

127
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,100
I got it.

128
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,500
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

129
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,100
You from around here?
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

130
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,600
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

131
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,700
Just what I need is a college boy.

132
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,700
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

133
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,200
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

134
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,000
- Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.
- I intend to.

135
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,400
Inspector Callahan.

136
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,200
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

137
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,100
I'll remember that.

138
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

139
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,600
You're a sweet man, Harry.

140
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,200
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

141
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,200
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?
That's one thing about our Harry.

142
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,600
Doesn't play favorites.

143
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,500
Harry hates everybody: limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

144
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,000
You name it.
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

145
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,600
Especially spics.

146
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,600
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

147
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,500
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

148
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,500
You, on the roof!

149
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,000
You, there!

150
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,800
Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.

151
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,000
Turn around
and put your hands in the air.

152
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
I don 't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!

153
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,500
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

154
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,200
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.
That's possible.

155
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,900
- Attention, all units.
- Turn that thing up louder.

156
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,300
Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.

157
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,300
He is an adult male.
Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.

158
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...

159
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,700
...pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.

160
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,500
He had a tan suitcase...
...which probably contains a
30-06 rifle. He's wanted...

161
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,100
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!
I know what you mean.

162
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
- There!
- What?

163
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,800
Tan suitcase.

164
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,300
- Where?
- I lost him.

165
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
There he goes, over there.
Does that bag look tan?

166
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.
Go to Filber and hang a left.

167
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,600
Look out for these people!
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

168
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,800
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

169
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,200
I saw him.

170
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
- There he is.
- I see him.

171
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,400
Car 2, the license number...
...at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.

172
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,200
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go in here.

173
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,400
Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?

174
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,800
Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.

175
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
10-4.

176
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,200
You can cancel that 10-25.
Three cars here.

177
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,800
Anybody home?

178
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,100
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

179
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,700
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

180
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,700
You getting an eyeful?
You goddamn pie hawker!

181
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,100
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

182
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

183
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

184
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,800
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

185
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,200
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

186
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Beat it. Get out of here.

187
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,900
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

188
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,600
I just had another thought.

189
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,300
Yeah? About what?

190
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,900
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

191
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,800
Inspector 71.

192
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,400
Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.

193
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,600
Inspector 71.
Do you read me?

194
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,700
- This is Inspector 71.
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.

195
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,600
California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.

196
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,500
10-4. We're on our way.

197
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,100
It's some idiot.

198
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,000
Where? I don't see him.

199
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,800
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

200
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,200
I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.

201
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,600
In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.

202
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,400
California license D-dog,
C-Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.

203
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,900
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

204
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,800
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here... .

205
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,900
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

206
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Don't you try to get me!

207
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

208
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,600
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

209
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,600
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

210
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Won't you try to grab me?

211
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,700
A friend of mine was up about 20 floors
with a jumper a few years ago.

212
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,300
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.
Mashed all over.

213
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,700
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which... .

214
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,900
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

215
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,600
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

216
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,900
It's such a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

217
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,800
Even if they find your driver's license!
All that blood!

218
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,400
I think I'm going to puke!

219
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,400
Don't do that, son.
All those people down there looking up.

220
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,500
The fire chief looking up.
With his face... .

221
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,400
You bastard!

222
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,500
Get the stretcher up here.

223
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,100
Now you know why I'm called Dirty Harry.
Every dirty job that comes along.

224
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,800
Inspector 71.

225
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,300
This is Inspector 71.

226
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,800
Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.

227
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,900
What about him?
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

228
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,000
Anybody know who the boy is?
His name was Charlie Russell.

229
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,900
I'm his mother.

230
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,400
He's only 10 years old.

231
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,600
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!
You'd better go check on the mother.

232
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,200
What do you have?

233
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,800
That 30-06 shell casing.

234
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
He was up here all right.

235
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,100
Welcome to Homicide.

236
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,500
The man who designed blue serge uniforms
for police departments...

237
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,300
...has to sell these for a living!

238
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,300
.458 Magnum?

239
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,200
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

240
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,900
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

241
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,900
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.
What have you got, Lieutenant?

242
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,400
The blue flags represent the units that
are going to be on duty by dark tonight.

243
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,800
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

244
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,700
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

245
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,900
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

246
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,400
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.
We're saving that for him.

247
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,100
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

248
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,800
It's a building that overlooks the roof
where they spotted him yesterday.

249
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Something bothering you?

250
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,400
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

251
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,500
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

252
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,800
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

253
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

254
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,300
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

255
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,400
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

256
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,400
Must appeal to their
superego or something.
Scorpio strikes again.

257
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,900
They like that feeling.

258
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,600
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

259
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,700
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

260
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,800
And they're having a novena tonight.
Go on.

261
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,000
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.
The Russell boy was black.

262
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,800
He may just figure
he owes himself a padre.

263
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,400
Inspector 71.

264
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,600
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

265
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,400
How about the priest?
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

266
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,100
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.
Who?

267
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,300
Never guess.

268
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

269
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,200
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

270
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,100
Son of a bitch took the bait!

271
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,300
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

272
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
Now!

273
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,900
- You all right?
- I think so.

274
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,700
Call an ambulance.

275
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
Collins never knew what hit him.

276
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,900
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

277
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

278
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,300
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

279
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,000
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

280
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,400
Ann Mary Deacon.
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

281
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,100
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

282
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,000
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive. "

283
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,200
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

284
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,500
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

285
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,300
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

286
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,200
One man with yellow bag.
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

287
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,800
9 p.m.

288
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,900
She has oxygen
till 3 a.m. tomorrow.
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

289
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,800
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

290
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,900
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio. "

291
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,500
Anything else?

292
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,000
The mother identified the bra...

293
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,000
...the hank of hair...

294
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,400
...and that.

295
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,600
The dentist identified that.

296
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,900
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

297
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,700
You know she's dead.
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

298
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,300
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

299
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,400
He's using up a lot of favors.

300
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,300
He wants to pay.

301
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,300
No tricks.

302
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,800
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

303
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,200
You got it.
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
- All right.

304
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,000
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

305
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,400
No cover?
Not even one man?

306
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,600
Sure that's how to do it?
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

307
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,800
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

308
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,200
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

309
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,000
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

310
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,000
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

311
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,400
Testing 1, 2, 3...

312
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,900
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

313
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,700
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow. "
Okay, that's better.

314
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,000
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

315
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,400
...forget it.

316
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,000
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?
Bring it back in one piece.

317
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,600
$200,000.

318
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,900
Count it and sign for it.

319
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,200
Did you count it out?

320
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Did you count it, chief?

321
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,200
It's not my responsibility.

322
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,600
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

323
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,400
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

324
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,200
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

325
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:35,000
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

326
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,900
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

327
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,200
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

328
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,300
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

329
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,400
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

330
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,500
- You got a yellow suitcase?
- Yeah, I got it right with me.

331
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,800
- What's your name?
- Callahan.

332
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,400
- What are you?
- Police officer.

333
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,200
Hello?

334
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,700
All right, police officer...

335
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,600
...this is how we play.

336
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,900
I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.

337
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,100
If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.

338
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,700
If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...

339
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,300
...the girl dies.

340
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,400
- Is the girl okay?
- Just shut up and listen.

341
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,700
No car.

342
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,900
I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.

343
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,400
I ring 4 times.
You don 't answer by the fourth ring...

344
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,000
...that's the end of the game.

345
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,600
The girl dies.

346
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,600
What time you got?

347
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,700
- 9:30. Now listen...
- You listen.

348
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm watching you.

349
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,000
Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.

350
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,200
Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?

351
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,600
- Yeah.
- I hope you're not stupid.

352
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,800
Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.

353
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,700
Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.

354
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,100
You sound like you had a good rest.

355
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,000
You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.

356
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,600
You better make it,
because if you don 't, dead girl!

357
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,800
Public phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.

358
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,900
Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.

359
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,000
What's in the bag, man?

360
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,400
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

361
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Just give us the wallet.

362
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,700
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

363
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,600
Don't answer that!

364
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,600
- Who picked it up?
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.

365
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,900
Chico, he hung up.

366
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,900
- You know Mt. Davidson Park?
- Yeah.
Go to the cross.

367
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,200
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

368
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,600
I'm going up.

369
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,400
I see a couple of people.

370
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,900
Just a couple of kids necking.
Boys or girls?

371
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,800
I'm Callahan.

372
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
My friends call me Alice.

373
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,200
And I will take a dare.

374
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,700
When was the last time
you were busted?

375
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,100
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

376
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,400
Well, do it at home.

377
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,100
Freeze!

378
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,700
Just like a statue.

379
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,100
That's right.

380
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,600
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

381
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,400
I'll kill you and the girl both.

382
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,400
Understand?

383
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,000
Yeah.

384
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,000
Drop the bag.

385
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,500
Left hand.

386
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,700
Let's see the gun.

387
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,100
My!

388
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,100
That's a big one.

389
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,400
Left hand. Throw it.

390
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,900
Easy.

391
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,300
Raise your hands.
Come on, get them up.

392
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,200
Now turn.

393
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,100
Face the cross.

394
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,800
Come on.

395
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,800
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

396
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,600
You lift that hand once more and
I won't let you know where the girl is!

397
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,100
Do we understand each other?

398
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,900
Do we understand each other?

399
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,000
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

400
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,300
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

401
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,800
Do we understand each other?

402
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,000
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

403
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,100
Listen to me carefully.

404
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,200
I've changed my mind.

405
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,600
I'm going to let her die.

406
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,400
I just wanted you to know that.

407
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:06,200
You understand? I ijust wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.

408
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,600
Goodbye, Callahan!

409
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,300
Chico, don't kill him!

410
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,700
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, Chief.

411
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,500
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

412
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,700
He's right here.
He's got two cracked ribs.

413
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,600
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

414
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,300
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.
I'm sending him home.

415
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,000
Right, Chief.

416
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,400
He says beat it! That's an order.

417
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,200
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

418
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,800
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

419
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,100
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

420
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,800
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.
What am I going to tell him?

421
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,500
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

422
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,100
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

423
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,900
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

424
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,100
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

425
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,000
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

426
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,000
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

427
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,700
- Put him on.
- What is it?

428
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,200
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

429
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,700
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

430
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,000
Long blond hair...

431
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,100
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

432
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:48,500
Pale complexion.
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

433
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,900
They usually give a phony name.

434
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,900
But I've seen him someplace.

435
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,100
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

436
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,200
I'm trying to think!

437
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,800
It was... .

438
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,300
I believe he works around here.
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

439
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,300
Yes, just a moment.

440
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,900
She'll be dead in an hour!
I'm trying to remember!

441
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,000
I've got who he is.

442
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,900
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

443
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,100
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

444
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,900
- Live where?
- There.

445
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,200
Kezar Stadium.

446
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,100
Illegal entry. No warrant.

447
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,100
Looks like we climb.

448
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,000
Too much linguine.

449
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,800
I'll find another way.

450
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
Stop!

451
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,800
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

452
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,800
You need any help?

453
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,600
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

454
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,400
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

455
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,000
Let me have a doctor!

456
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,000
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

457
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,000
The girl, where is she?
You tried to kill me!

458
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,300
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

459
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,700
I want a lawyer.
I said, where's the girl?

460
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,100
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

461
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,500
I have the right to a lawyer!

462
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,800
Don't! Please!

463
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,400
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

464
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,100
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

465
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,200
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

466
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,000
- It's Inspector Callahan.
- Have him come in, please.

467
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,700
Won't you come this way?

468
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,400
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

469
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,700
I'll be done in a minute.

470
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,500
Have a seat.

471
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,000
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

472
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,800
A very unusual piece of police work.

473
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,000
Really amazing.

474
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,100
I had some luck.

475
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,000
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

476
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,400
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

477
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,600
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

478
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,800
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

479
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,300
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

480
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,500
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

481
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,700
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

482
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,000
You should be.
I've got news for you.

483
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,700
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

484
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,800
What are you talking about?
He's free!

485
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,900
You're letting him go?
We have to.
We can't try him.

486
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,500
And why is that?
Because I'm not wasting
1 /2 million tax dollars...

487
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,300
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

488
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,800
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

489
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,100
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

490
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,400
Zero.

491
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:28,400
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

492
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,500
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

493
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:34,600
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

494
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,500
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?
It's the law.

495
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,200
Then the law is crazy!

496
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,500
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

497
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:50,400
He also holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

498
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,900
Your Honor?

499
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:57,500
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

500
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:01,900
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

501
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,800
...is inadmissible in court.
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

502
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,200
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

503
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,700
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!
But I didn't know that!

504
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:20,900
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

505
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:25,200
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

506
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:30,800
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...
...physical evidence...

507
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,200
...would have to be excluded.

508
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,800
There must be something
you can get him on!

509
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,100
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

510
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,000
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

511
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,300
Now, the suspect's rights...

512
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,200
...were violated...

513
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,600
...under the 4th and 5th...

514
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,500
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

515
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:01,200
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

516
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:06,100
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?
The district attorney's office!

517
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,700
If you'll let us.

518
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,200
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

519
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,500
He won't be out there long.
What is that supposed to mean?

520
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,800
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

521
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:25,000
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

522
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,400
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

523
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,300
How do you know?

524
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,200
Because he likes it.

525
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,800
You sure you weren't tailed?

526
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,900
Yeah.

527
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,700
You really want $200 worth.

528
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,600
Every penny of it.

529
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:45,000
Might as well be comfortable.
Go on, sit.

530
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,800
Relax.

531
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,900
Take it easy.

532
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,500
It's going to be all right.

533
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,500
You sure you want the rest of it?

534
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,800
Every penny's worth!

535
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,500
You black son of a bitch!

536
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,600
This one's on the house.

537
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,400
That's got to be him.

538
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,600
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

539
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,900
I swear it. As God is my judge.
Why are they harassing you?

540
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,100
They tried to frame me with the murder.

541
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,100
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

542
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,300
I'm supposed to be innocent until proven
guilty and look at what they did to me.

543
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,000
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

544
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:56,200
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.
Did you see who did this to you?

545
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:02,300
Can you identify him?
His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.

546
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,700
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

547
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:11,200
Since then he's given
a statement to The Chronicle.

548
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,600
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

549
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,100
What about it, Harry?

550
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,200
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.
Have you been following him?

551
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,100
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

552
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,700
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

553
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,100
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

554
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:39,100
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.
I don't want any more surveillance!

555
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,700
Neither does he.

556
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,400
What does that mean?

557
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,000
Good night, sir.

558
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,400
Go ahead. Try them.

559
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,300
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

560
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,600
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

561
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,100
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

562
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,200
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

563
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:13,300
Doing a lot of thinking about it and... .

564
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,300
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

565
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,900
...what for? You know?

566
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,200
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

567
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,000
See you tomorrow. Same time?

568
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,400
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

569
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,900
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.
No class.

570
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,000
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

571
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,200
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

572
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,000
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

573
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:17,800
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

574
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,300
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

575
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,200
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

576
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,800
And I think...

577
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,400
...what if it's the last time I see him?

578
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,700
Am I the only one?

579
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:36,100
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?
No.

580
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,400
You mean she got used to it?

581
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,000
No, she never did, really.
What, then?

582
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,100
She's dead.

583
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,600
Please, forgive me.

584
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,900
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.
No reason for it, really.

585
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,100
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

586
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,700
I want you to tell Chico...

587
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:04,500
...that I understand him quitting.
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

588
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:08,200
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

589
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,200
I really don't.

590
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,600
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

591
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,300
What the hell happened to you?
My wife's brother.

592
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,500
I hit her...
...so he hit me.

593
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,200
Several times.

594
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,000
$5.69.

595
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,500
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.
14 times the last 3 years.

596
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:15,300
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

597
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,100
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

598
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,700
Please, I scare easy.

599
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,400
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

600
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,600
Goodbye.

601
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,500
See you tomorrow.

602
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,600
Everybody out who gets out here?

603
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,200
School bus inspector.
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

604
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,900
I'm authorizing it, so go.
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

605
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,300
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

606
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,800
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

607
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,600
Let's have some fun now.
Who knows a song?

608
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:51,000
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.
Come on, sing for us.

609
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:54,100
Old MacDonald had a farm.

610
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,200
E-l-E-l-O

611
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,000
And on his farm, he had some ducks...

612
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:34,100
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

613
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,300
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

614
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:44,500
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

615
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,200
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

616
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,600
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

617
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,000
Tell them the man is dangerous.

618
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,900
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

619
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,200
"To the City of San Francisco.
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

620
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,000
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

621
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:12,300
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

622
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:17,500
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...
...exactly what I say. Scorpio. "

623
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,400
Better have somebody standing by!
I don't think it's a false alarm.

624
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:29,400
There's a call for you on line 2.
I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.

625
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:39,300
- It's the Mayor.
- I got 7 kids from Park Street School.

626
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:45,600
I got the bus and... .
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

627
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:49,400
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.
Just tell him.

628
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,300
Not my fault, he had a gun...
Just your name!

629
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,100
This is Marcella Platt.

630
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:03,500
You can check if you want.
But I don 't see any point.
I'm not bullshitting.

631
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:08,400
It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...
...the kids start dying.

632
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:12,300
- The plane ready?
- It's being fueled, and ready to go.

633
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:15,000
The money will be there
by the time you get there.

634
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,500
Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.

635
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,400
Just me and a busload of kids.

636
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:23,800
I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake
Blvd., on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.

637
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,100
I don 't want any police cars...
...helicopters, whatever.

638
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:31,400
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

639
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,400
Where are you going?

640
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,900
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

641
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,600
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.
I give you my word of honor.

642
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,000
Marcella Platt. It checks.

643
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,200
Willing to take the money to him?

644
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,200
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

645
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,400
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

646
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,600
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!
And that's a direct order!

647
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,800
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

648
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,300
Row, row, row your boat

649
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,600
Gently down the stream

650
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,900
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

651
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:42,500
Where are we going?

652
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:47,000
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

653
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:51,800
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.
I want to go home to my mother.

654
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,800
Go home to your what?

655
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,900
Now, sing! Sing again!

656
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:59,400
Row, row, row your boat
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

657
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,100
Are you sick?
What is it?

658
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,400
Sing or your mothers will die!

659
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:09,700
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

660
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,400
Get in the right-hand lane.

661
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:23,200
Not right to treat children that way.
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

662
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,800
And get in the right-hand lane!

663
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,100
I want my mother.

664
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:45,000
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.
Make a right there.

665
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,900
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

666
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,300
Not this one.

667
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,500
I want my mother.

668
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,700
Shut up!

669
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,400
Just get to the right!

670
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,800
Jesus!

671
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,100
What the hell is he doing up there?

672
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,900
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

673
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,600
Drop the gun, creep!

674
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I'll blow his brains out.

675
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,100
Drop the fucking gun!

676
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,700
I know what you're thinking.

677
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,700
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

678
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,500
To tell you the truth, I forgot myself,
in all this excitement.

679
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,400
But being this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

680
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,300
...and will blow your head clean off...

681
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,900
...you've got to ask yourself...

682
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,400
..."Do I feel lucky?"

683
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Well, do you, punk?
