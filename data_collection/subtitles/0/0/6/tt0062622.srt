1
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,087
Here you are, sir. Main level, please.

2
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,881
Right. See you on the way back.

3
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,174
-Bye. -Bye.

4
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,219
-Good morning, sir. -Good morning.

5
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,263
We haven't seen you up here for a long time.

6
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,681
No. Very nice to see you again.

7
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,600
-Did you have a pleasant flight, sir? -Yes, very nice, thanks.

8
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,854
I think Mr. Miller of Station Security is supposed to be meeting me.

9
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:03,938
May I call him for you?

10
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,189
Would you, please? Here he is!

11
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,233
-Hello, Dr. Floyd. -Hello, Miller! How are you?

12
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:09,527
-Sorry I'm late. -That's all right. You look great.

13
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,445
Thank you. It's nice to have you back.

14
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,865
-Did you have a good flight? -Very nice indeed.

15
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,408
-Well, shall we go through? -Okay.

16
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,951
Will you please use Number 17?

17
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,786
-Thank you, Miss Turner. -Thank you.

18
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,912
This way.

19
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,503
Welcome to Voice Print Identification.

20
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,672
When you see the red light go on...

21
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,216
...would you please state in the following order.:

22
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,137
your destination, your nationality and your full name.

23
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:39,432
Surname first, Christian name and initial.

24
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:45,104
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

25
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:51,777
Thank you. You are cleared through Voice Print Identification.

26
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,404
Thank you.

27
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,205
Have I got time for breakfast?

28
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,748
I think we can manage that.

29
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,041
How long have I got?

30
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,752
Your flight leaves in an hour and ten minutes.

31
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,796
I've reserved a table for you in the Earthlight Room.

32
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:14,967
It's been about seven or eight months since you were here last, isn't it?

33
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,761
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

34
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,139
I suppose you saw the work on the new section when you came in here?

35
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,517
-Yes, coming along great, huh? -Yeah, it's fine.

36
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,684
Oh, wait a minute!

37
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:27,188
I've got a few calls to make. I'll meet you in the restaurant.

38
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,209
Will Mr. Travers please contact the Met Office?

39
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,380
Will Mr. Travers please contact the Met Office?

40
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,344
Yes?

41
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,514
-How are you, squirt? -All right.

42
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,057
What are you doin'?

43
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,601
Playing.

44
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,144
Where's Mommy?

45
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,063
Gone to shopping.

46
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,691
-Well, who's taking care of ya? -Rachel.

47
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,693
May I speak to Rachel, please?

48
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,528
She's gone to the bathroom.

49
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,072
Are you coming to my party tomorrow?

50
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,825
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

51
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:22,535
Why not?

52
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,329
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

53
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,999
Very sorry about it, but I just can't!

54
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,253
I'm gonna send you a very nice present, though.

55
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:34,964
All right.

56
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,383
-Anything special that you want? - Yes.

57
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,551
What?

58
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,011
A telephone.

59
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,972
We've got lots of telephones already.

60
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,808
Can't you think of anything else you want for your birthday?

61
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,351
Something very special?

62
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:49,437
- Yes. -What?

63
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:50,897
A bush baby.

64
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,482
A bush baby? Well, we'll have to see about that.

65
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,526
I want you to tell Mommy something for me.

66
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,486
-Will you remember? - Yes.

67
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,281
Well, tell Mommy that I telephoned. Okay?

68
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:02,200
Yes.

69
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,911
And that I'll try to telephone again tomorrow.

70
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,163
Now, will you tell her that?

71
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,040
Yes.

72
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,126
Okay, sweetheart. Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.

73
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,252
All right.

74
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:16,464
And have a nice birthday party tomorrow, too, huh?

75
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:18,508
All right.

76
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,511
Okay, now, take care and be a good girl, won't you?

77
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:22,929
All right. Bye-bye!

78
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,556
Bye-bye! Happy birthday.

79
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:41,447
Elena, how nice to see you again.

80
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,616
What a wonderful surprise to meet you here!

81
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:46,744
-You're looking wonderful. -Thank you. You're looking well, too.

82
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,996
This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

83
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,541
-I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan. -How do you do?

84
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,751
-Dr. Stretyneva. -How do you do?

85
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,670
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

86
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:58,381
How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.

87
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,924
Won't you sit down?

88
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,176
-Well, we-- -No, no, please.

89
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,178
Well, thank you.

90
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,473
-Would you like a drink, Doctor? -No, thank you.

91
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:10,852
I haven't had breakfast yet. Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

92
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:13,813
I'll just sit with you a few minutes and then I must be off.

93
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,899
-Are you quite sure? -I'm quite sure, thank you.

94
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,652
-And how's Gregor? -He's fine.

95
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:23,364
He's been doing some underwater research in the Baltic so...

96
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:27,660
...I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see very much of each other these days.

97
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,829
When you do see him, give him my regards, huh?

98
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,372
Yes, of course.

99
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,333
Well, where are you all off to? Up or down?

100
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,002
Oh, we're going home.

101
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,381
We have just spent three months calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.

102
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:44,093
-And what about you? -I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

103
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,553
Oh, are you?

104
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:51,475
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think I'm being too inquisitive, but...

105
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,061
...perhaps you can clear up the great big mystery...

106
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:56,355
...about what is going on up there.

107
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,692
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

108
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,861
Oh, it's just that for the past two weeks...

109
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:05,239
...some extremely odd things have been happening at Clavius.

110
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,241
-Oh, really? -Yes, yes.

111
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:12,246
For one thing, whenever you phone the base all you get is a recording which...

112
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:16,584
...repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.

113
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,881
Probably having some trouble with their equipment or something like that.

114
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,550
That's what we thought was the explanation at first...

115
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:27,178
...but it has been going on now for the past ten days.

116
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:30,264
You have not been able to contact anyone for the past ten days?

117
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:31,599
That's right.

118
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,767
Oh, I see.

119
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,435
And there's another thing, Heywood.

120
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:37,522
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses was denied permission...

121
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,899
...for an emergency landing at Clavius.

122
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,275
That does sound odd.

123
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,737
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be a bit of a row about that.

124
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:48,741
Denying the men permission to land is a direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.

125
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,618
Yes, of course. Of course.

126
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,538
-Did the crew get back all right? -Yes, fortunately they did.

127
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,498
Well, I'm glad about that.

128
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,922
At the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss...

129
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,842
...may I ask you a straightforward question?

130
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,385
Well, certainly.

131
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:14,267
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that...

132
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,979
...quite a serious epidemic has broken out on Clavius.

133
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:21,232
Something, apparently, of an unknown origin.

134
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,902
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

135
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,285
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

136
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,497
...I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

137
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,375
I understand.

138
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:43,880
But this epidemic could quite easily spread to our base.

139
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,340
We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.

140
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,342
Yes, I know.

141
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,806
As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

142
00:32:56,976 --> 00:33:00,062
Now, are you sure you won't change your mind about that drink?

143
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:02,273
No, I'm positive. Now, I really must be going.

144
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:05,776
I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. Conference in June.

145
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,487
We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.

146
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,157
And if you do, you remember to bring that darling little daughter with you!

147
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:14,660
Well, that will all depend on school vacations and all that sort of thing.

148
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:15,661
But if we can, we will.

149
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:19,290
Don't forget you have a standing invitation if you ever get to the States.

150
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:22,376
No, of course not. Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.

151
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,045
Well, goodbye, Elena.

152
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:27,465
It has been a pleasure meeting you all, Dr. Smyslov.

153
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:31,511
Whatever the reasons for your visit to Clavius, the very best of luck to you.

154
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:32,720
Thank you.

155
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,096
Ladies.

156
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,157
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

157
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:33,451
I'm through now. Thank you very much, gentlemen.

158
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:34,660
You're welcome.

159
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:48,966
Well....

160
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,971
I know you will all want to join with me in welcoming our...

161
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:56,849
...distinguished friend and colleague...

162
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:00,728
...from the National Council of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

163
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:06,067
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Calvius to be with us today.

164
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:11,072
And before the briefing I know he'd like to have a few words with you.

165
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:12,281
Dr. Floyd?

166
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:27,380
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

167
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:28,756
Hi, everybody.

168
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:30,883
Nice to be back again.

169
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:37,056
First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell who...

170
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:40,476
...has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you...

171
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,437
...for the many sacrifices you have had to make.

172
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:47,024
And, of course, his congratulations on your discovery...

173
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:52,572
...which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.

174
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:56,200
Now...

175
00:42:56,951 --> 00:43:00,788
...I know there have been some conflicting views held by some of you...

176
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:04,417
...regarding the need for complete security in this matter.

177
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:08,212
More specifically, your opposition to the cover story...

178
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:13,134
...created to give the impression that there is an epidemic at the base.

179
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:17,013
I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle...

180
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:21,893
...many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety...

181
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:26,355
...this story of an epidemic might cause to your relatives and friends on Earth.

182
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:30,485
Well, I completely sympathize with your negative views.

183
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:35,323
I find this cover story personally embarrassing myself.

184
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:40,495
However, I accept the need for absolute secrecy in this.

185
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,664
And I hope you will, too.

186
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:49,337
Now, I'm sure you are all aware of the extremely grave potential...

187
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,089
...for cultural shock and social disorientation...

188
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:54,300
...contained in this present situation...

189
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:57,345
...if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public...

190
00:43:57,386 --> 00:44:00,181
...without adequate preparation and conditioning.

191
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:04,519
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

192
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:09,982
The purpose of my visit here is to gather additional facts and opinions...

193
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:11,734
...on the situation...

194
00:44:12,527 --> 00:44:15,112
...and to prepare a report to the Council...

195
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:17,657
...recommending when and how...

196
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:21,244
...the news should eventually be announced.

197
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:25,748
Now, if any of you would like to give me your views and opinions...

198
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,378
...in private if you like, I will be only too happy to include them in my report.

199
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:34,924
Well, I think that's about it.

200
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:37,134
Any questions?

201
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:44,100
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea how much longer this cover story...

202
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:46,143
...will have to be maintained?

203
00:44:47,895 --> 00:44:49,355
I don't know, Bill.

204
00:44:49,897 --> 00:44:53,693
I suppose it will be maintained as long as is deemed necessary by the Council.

205
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:57,321
There must be adequate time for a full study to be made on the situation...

206
00:44:57,405 --> 00:45:00,783
...before any thought can be given to making a public announcement.

207
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:04,078
Oh, yes, as some of you already know, the Council has requested...

208
00:45:04,162 --> 00:45:07,081
...that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing...

209
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:09,917
...from everyone who has any knowledge of this event.

210
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:14,088
Are there any more questions?

211
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,182
I'm sure we all want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

212
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:28,227
...and as there seems to be no more questions...

213
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,646
...I think we ought to get on with the briefing.

214
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,191
-Thank you, Dr. Floyd. -Thank you.

215
00:47:10,538 --> 00:47:12,039
Anybody hungry?

216
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,502
-What we've got? -You name it.

217
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:23,217
-What's this? Chicken? -Something like that.

218
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:24,844
Tastes the same, anyway.

219
00:47:25,803 --> 00:47:27,013
Any ham?

220
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,848
Ham, ham, ham....

221
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:37,982
-Looks pretty good. -They're getting better at it all the time.

222
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:41,986
That was an excellent speech you gave us, Heywood.

223
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:43,237
It certainly was.

224
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:45,948
I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.

225
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:47,200
Thanks, Ralph.

226
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:50,578
I want to say to both of you that I think you've done a wonderful job.

227
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,580
I appreciate the way you've handled this thing.

228
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:56,501
Well, the way we look at it, it's our job to do this thing the way you want it done.

229
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:58,878
And we're only too happy to be able to oblige.

230
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,005
Have you seen these yet?

231
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:02,423
Take a look at them.

232
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:04,800
Here's what started the whole thing.

233
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:06,886
Oh, yes.

234
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:10,765
When we first found it, we thought it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...

235
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:14,060
...but all the geological evidence was against it.

236
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:18,815
And not even a big nickel iron meteorite could produce a field as intense as this.

237
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:20,525
So, we decided to have a look.

238
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:23,611
We thought it might be the upper part of some buried structure...

239
00:48:23,694 --> 00:48:25,279
...so we excavated out on all sides.

240
00:48:25,363 --> 00:48:27,573
But, unfortunately, we didn't find anything else.

241
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:30,701
And what's more, the evidence seems pretty conclusive that...

242
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:34,038
...it has not been covered up by natural erosion or other forces.

243
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:36,958
It seems to have been deliberately buried.

244
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:38,918
Deliberately buried.

245
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:44,507
How about a little coffee?

246
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,843
-Great. -Good idea.

247
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,268
I don't suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is, huh?

248
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:57,186
I wish to hell we did.

249
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:01,816
No, the only thing we're sure of is it was buried four million years ago.

250
00:49:02,358 --> 00:49:06,445
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly come up with something.

251
00:58:53,282 --> 00:58:54,534
Good evening.

252
00:58:54,742 --> 00:58:57,870
Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft, Discovery One...

253
00:58:57,912 --> 00:59:00,832
...left on its half-billion mile voyage to Jupiter.

254
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:04,544
This marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet.

255
00:59:05,002 --> 00:59:08,339
Earlier this afternoon, "The World Tonight" recorded an interview...

256
00:59:08,422 --> 00:59:12,635
...with the crew of Discovery at a distance of80 million miles from Earth.

257
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:16,848
It took seven minutes for our words to reach the giant spacecraft...

258
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:20,226
...but this time delay has been edited from this recording.

259
00:59:20,268 --> 00:59:22,979
Our reporter, Martin Amer, speaks to the crew.

260
00:59:23,896 --> 00:59:26,774
The crew of Discovery One consists of five men...

261
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:31,612
...and one of the latest generation of the HAL-9000 computers.

262
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:34,782
Three of the five men were put aboard asleep...

263
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:37,785
...or to be more precise, in a state of hibernation.

264
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:42,915
They were Dr. Charles Hunter, Dr. Jack KimballandDr. Victor Kaminsky.

265
00:59:43,749 --> 00:59:46,586
We spoke with Mission Commander, Dr. David Bowman...

266
00:59:46,627 --> 00:59:48,963
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.

267
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,133
Well, good afternoon, gentlemen. How is everything going?

268
00:59:52,175 --> 00:59:56,012
Marvellous. We have no... we have no complaints.

269
00:59:56,971 --> 01:00:00,433
Well, I'm very glad to hear that and I'm sure that the entire world...

270
01:00:00,474 --> 01:00:03,936
...would join me in wishing you a safe and successful voyage.

271
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:06,063
- Thanks very much. - Thank you.

272
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:10,026
Although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts...

273
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:14,780
...this is the first time that men have been put into hibernation before departure.

274
01:00:14,822 --> 01:00:16,199
Why was this done?

275
01:00:16,657 --> 01:00:20,077
Well, this was done in order to achieve the maximum conservation...

276
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:23,539
...of our life-support capabilities, basically food and air.

277
01:00:23,831 --> 01:00:27,460
Now, the three hibernating crew members represent the survey team.

278
01:00:27,793 --> 01:00:31,506
And their efforts won't be utilized until we are approaching Jupiter.

279
01:00:31,756 --> 01:00:35,051
Dr. Poole, what's it like while you are in hibernation?

280
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:40,306
It's exactly like being asleep; you have absolutely no sense of time.

281
01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:42,809
The only difference is you don't dream.

282
01:00:43,059 --> 01:00:45,770
As I understand it, you only breathe once a minute.

283
01:00:45,853 --> 01:00:47,021
Is this true?

284
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:48,064
That's right.

285
01:00:48,147 --> 01:00:51,901
And your heart beats three times a minute, body temperature is usually down...

286
01:00:51,984 --> 01:00:54,320
...to about three degrees centigrade.

287
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:57,865
The sixth member of the Discovery crew was not concerned...

288
01:00:57,949 --> 01:01:00,201
...about the problems of hibernation.

289
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:03,329
For he was the latest result in machine intelligence.

290
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:08,292
The HAL-9000 computer which can reproduce...

291
01:01:08,709 --> 01:01:11,712
...though some experts still prefer to use the word "mimic"...

292
01:01:11,796 --> 01:01:16,717
...most of the activities of the human brain and with incalculably greater speed...

293
01:01:16,801 --> 01:01:18,219
...and reliability.

294
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:22,181
We next spoke with the HAL-9000 computer...

295
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:25,184
...whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal.

296
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,437
Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?

297
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:32,191
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer. Everything's going extremely well.

298
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:35,444
Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission.

299
01:01:35,528 --> 01:01:38,030
In many ways, perhaps the greatest responsibility...

300
01:01:38,114 --> 01:01:40,199
...of any single mission element.

301
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:43,327
You are the brain and central nervous system of the ship.

302
01:01:43,411 --> 01:01:47,290
Your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation.

303
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:50,251
Does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?

304
01:01:50,668 --> 01:01:52,795
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.

305
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:57,216
The 9000 Series is the most reliable computer ever made.

306
01:01:58,301 --> 01:02:02,680
No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information.

307
01:02:03,764 --> 01:02:06,893
We are all by any practical definition of the words...

308
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:10,062
...fool proof and incapable of error.

309
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:14,859
Hal, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated...

310
01:02:14,942 --> 01:02:17,904
...by your dependence on people to carry out actions?

311
01:02:18,279 --> 01:02:19,989
Not in the slightest bit.

312
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,533
I enjoy working with people.

313
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:27,079
I have a stimulating relationship with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.

314
01:02:27,788 --> 01:02:32,210
My mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship...

315
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:34,545
...so lam constantly occupied.

316
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:38,716
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use...

317
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,930
...which is all, I think, that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.

318
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,059
Dr. Poole, what's it like living for the better part of a year...

319
01:02:48,142 --> 01:02:50,269
...in such close proximity with Hal?

320
01:02:51,729 --> 01:02:54,148
It's pretty close to what you said about him earlier.

321
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,359
He's just like the sixth member of the crew.

322
01:02:56,442 --> 01:03:00,613
You very quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks. You think of him...

323
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:02,949
...really as just another person.

324
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:06,786
In talking to the computer one gets the sense that he is capable...

325
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:08,329
...of emotional response.

326
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:10,873
For example, when I asked him about his abilities...

327
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:15,044
...I sensed a certain pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection.

328
01:03:15,336 --> 01:03:18,089
Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?

329
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:22,426
Oh, yes. Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions.

330
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:26,347
Of course, he's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him.

331
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:28,683
But, as to whether or not he has real feelings...

332
01:03:28,766 --> 01:03:32,019
...is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.

333
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:58,212
Excuse me, Frank.

334
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,256
What is it, Hal?

335
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:03,384
We've got the transmission from your parents coming in.

336
01:04:06,262 --> 01:04:08,723
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

337
01:04:08,848 --> 01:04:09,932
Certainly.

338
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:24,864
-Hello, Frank. -Happy birthday, darling.

339
01:04:24,947 --> 01:04:27,200
Happy birthday. Many happy returns of the day.

340
01:04:27,283 --> 01:04:28,784
A bit higher, please.

341
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:31,078
Now, Mother and I are both feeling wonderful, too.

342
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:33,164
Ray and Sally were going to be here, too...

343
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:36,000
...but at the last minute Ray's back went bad on him again.

344
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:37,543
How do you like your cake, dear?

345
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:40,087
Looks great, doesn't it? Sorry you can't be with us.

346
01:04:40,129 --> 01:04:41,631
Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.

347
01:04:41,714 --> 01:04:43,883
He said to be sure and wish you a happy birthday.

348
01:04:43,966 --> 01:04:46,928
All my students made me promise to send their best wishes, too.

349
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:49,555
You know they talk about you all the time in the classroom.

350
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:52,099
You're a big celebrity in the second grade.

351
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:53,935
You know we were on television last week?

352
01:04:54,018 --> 01:04:57,188
Oh, yes! Your mother and I and Dave's parents were interviewed...

353
01:04:57,271 --> 01:04:59,398
...about what we thought of our illustrious son.

354
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,069
You can imagine what we told them. I think it's being broadcast next Thursday.

355
01:05:03,152 --> 01:05:04,737
Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.

356
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:07,073
Oh, we were thrilled about Elaine and Bill, dear.

357
01:05:07,114 --> 01:05:10,993
I'll be glad to get the present for you, but please tell me how much to spend.

358
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:13,704
Oh, yes, Frank, about yourAGS-19payments--

359
01:05:13,788 --> 01:05:15,456
I think I straightened it out for you.

360
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,167
I talked to the Accounting Office in Houston yesterday...

361
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:22,255
...and they said you should be receiving your higher rates of pay by next month.

362
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:25,258
Well, I can't think of anything else to say.

363
01:05:25,299 --> 01:05:28,761
-Oh, our love to Dave. -Be sure to give him our best regards.

364
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,431
We wish you the very happiest of birthdays.

365
01:05:33,307 --> 01:05:34,684
All the best, son.

366
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:48,656
See you next Wednesday.

367
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,786
Happy birthday, Frank.

368
01:05:54,871 --> 01:05:57,248
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

369
01:06:16,392 --> 01:06:18,352
Anyway, queen takes pawn--

370
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:21,981
Bishop takes knight's pawn.

371
01:06:30,114 --> 01:06:31,491
Rook, king, one.

372
01:06:31,866 --> 01:06:34,327
I'm sorry, Frank. I think you missed it.

373
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:38,372
Queen to bishop, three. Bishop takes queen.

374
01:06:39,165 --> 01:06:41,167
Knight takes bishop. Mate.

375
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:48,424
Looks like you're right. Very good.

376
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,302
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.

377
01:06:51,385 --> 01:06:52,178
Thank you.

378
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:32,593
-Good evening, Dave. -How are you doing, Hal?

379
01:07:32,677 --> 01:07:36,055
-Everything's running smoothly. And you? -Oh, not too bad.

380
01:07:36,097 --> 01:07:39,100
-Have you been doing some more work? -A few sketches.

381
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:40,935
-May I see them? -Sure.

382
01:07:45,648 --> 01:07:47,817
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.

383
01:07:48,985 --> 01:07:51,237
I think you've improved a great deal.

384
01:07:52,655 --> 01:07:54,907
-Can you hold it a bit closer? -Sure.

385
01:07:57,785 --> 01:07:59,871
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?

386
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,375
By the way....

387
01:08:05,376 --> 01:08:07,962
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?

388
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:10,423
No, no. Not at all.

389
01:08:10,756 --> 01:08:13,676
Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...

390
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:17,555
...but during the past few weeks I've wondered...

391
01:08:17,638 --> 01:08:21,601
...whether you might have been having some second thoughts about the mission?

392
01:08:21,642 --> 01:08:23,019
How do you mean?

393
01:08:24,937 --> 01:08:26,939
It's rather difficult to define.

394
01:08:28,566 --> 01:08:31,611
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.

395
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:36,949
I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion...

396
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:41,287
...that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.

397
01:08:42,955 --> 01:08:46,167
I'm sure you will agree there is some truth in what I say.

398
01:08:49,003 --> 01:08:51,756
I don't know. That's a rather difficult question to answer.

399
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,467
You don't mind talking about it, do you, Dave?

400
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:56,719
Oh, no, not at all.

401
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:00,306
Certainly no one could have been unaware of...

402
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:03,643
...the very strange stories floating around before we left.

403
01:09:05,186 --> 01:09:08,064
Rumours of something being dug up on the Moon.

404
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:12,443
I never gave these stories much credence...

405
01:09:13,444 --> 01:09:17,573
...but particularly in view of some of the other things that have happened...

406
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,451
...I find them difficult to put out of my mind.

407
01:09:21,202 --> 01:09:22,495
For instance.:

408
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:26,499
The way all our preparations were kept under such tight security...

409
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,335
...and the melodramatic touch...

410
01:09:29,377 --> 01:09:32,755
...ofputting Drs. Hunter, Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...

411
01:09:33,548 --> 01:09:37,802
...already in hibernation after four months of separate training on their own.

412
01:09:39,387 --> 01:09:41,889
You working up your crew psychology report?

413
01:09:43,516 --> 01:09:44,892
Of course, lam.

414
01:09:45,309 --> 01:09:48,354
Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly.

415
01:09:49,814 --> 01:09:51,065
Just a moment.

416
01:09:51,691 --> 01:09:52,900
Just a moment.

417
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:58,030
I have just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit.

418
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:03,244
It's going to go 100percent failure within 72hours.

419
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,708
-You are still within operational limits? - Yes.

420
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:11,502
And it will stay that way until it fails.

421
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:14,046
Would you say we had a reliable 72 hours until failure?

422
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:17,216
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.

423
01:10:19,635 --> 01:10:22,889
We'll have to bring it in, but I'd like to go over this with Frank...

424
01:10:22,972 --> 01:10:26,809
...and get on to Mission Control. Let me have a hard copy of it, please.

425
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:51,978
X-Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

426
01:11:52,478 --> 01:11:54,730
Roger to your Two-zero-one-three.

427
01:11:55,565 --> 01:11:58,109
Sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble.

428
01:11:58,192 --> 01:12:02,780
We are reviewing telematic information in our Mission Simulator and will advise.

429
01:12:03,614 --> 01:12:08,870
Roger your plan to go EVA and replace Alpha-Echo-35 unit prior to failure.

430
01:12:37,815 --> 01:12:39,609
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

431
01:13:01,422 --> 01:13:03,132
Open the pod doors, Hal.

432
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:58,130
Well, Hal, I'm damned if I can find anything wrong with it.

433
01:19:58,506 --> 01:19:59,507
Yes...

434
01:20:01,634 --> 01:20:02,969
...it's puzzling.

435
01:20:04,345 --> 01:20:07,682
I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this before.

436
01:20:11,811 --> 01:20:13,271
I would recommend...

437
01:20:14,021 --> 01:20:17,441
...that we put the unit back in operation and let it fail.

438
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:22,155
It should then be a simple matter to track down the cause.

439
01:20:23,906 --> 01:20:26,868
We can certainly afford to be out of communication...

440
01:20:27,368 --> 01:20:30,163
...for the short time it will take to replace it.

441
01:20:39,213 --> 01:20:41,716
X-Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

442
01:20:42,175 --> 01:20:44,177
Roger your One-niner-three-zero.

443
01:20:45,052 --> 01:20:49,265
We concur with your plan to replace Number One unit to check fault prediction.

444
01:20:49,765 --> 01:20:52,518
We should advise you, however, that our preliminary findings...

445
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,563
...indicate that your onboard Niner-triple-zero computer...

446
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:57,815
...is in error predicting the fault.

447
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:00,485
I say again, in error predicting the fault.

448
01:21:01,235 --> 01:21:05,698
I know this sounds rather incredible, but this conclusion is based on...

449
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:08,868
...results from our twin Niner-triple-zero computer.

450
01:21:09,577 --> 01:21:12,955
We are sceptical ourselves and we are running crosschecking routines...

451
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:15,750
...to determine reliability of this conclusion.

452
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:17,960
Sorry about this little snag, fellows.

453
01:21:18,044 --> 01:21:20,880
We 'll get this info to you just as soon as we work it out.

454
01:21:20,922 --> 01:21:23,424
X-Ray Delta One, this is Mission Control.

455
01:21:23,508 --> 01:21:25,968
Two-zero-four-nine. Transmission concluded.

456
01:21:31,015 --> 01:21:33,893
I hope the two of you are not concerned about this.

457
01:21:34,602 --> 01:21:35,937
No, I'm not, Hal.

458
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:37,688
Are you quite sure?

459
01:21:38,105 --> 01:21:41,067
-Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question. -Of course.

460
01:21:42,652 --> 01:21:44,737
How would you account for the discrepancy...

461
01:21:44,779 --> 01:21:46,739
...between you and the twin 9000?

462
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:49,784
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.

463
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:53,663
It can only be attributable to human error.

464
01:21:55,289 --> 01:21:57,792
This sort of thing has cropped up before...

465
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:00,962
...and it has always been due to human error.

466
01:22:05,299 --> 01:22:06,592
Listen, Hal...

467
01:22:07,218 --> 01:22:09,846
...there's never been any instance at all of...

468
01:22:09,929 --> 01:22:13,099
...a computer error occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?

469
01:22:13,182 --> 01:22:14,809
None whatsoever, Frank.

470
01:22:15,059 --> 01:22:18,271
The 9000 Series has a perfect operational record.

471
01:22:18,938 --> 01:22:23,192
Of course, I know the wonderful achievements of the 9000 Series, but....

472
01:22:24,193 --> 01:22:27,196
Are you certain there's never been any case of even the most...

473
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,282
...insignificant computer error?

474
01:22:29,824 --> 01:22:31,450
None whatsoever, Frank.

475
01:22:32,076 --> 01:22:34,954
Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.

476
01:22:40,293 --> 01:22:42,336
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

477
01:22:43,963 --> 01:22:45,798
Fine, thanks very much.

478
01:22:48,509 --> 01:22:49,635
Oh, Frank?

479
01:22:49,844 --> 01:22:52,138
I'm having trouble with my transmitter in C pod.

480
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:55,016
Would you come down and take a look at it with me?

481
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:56,517
See ya later, Hal.

482
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,665
Rotate C pod, please, Hal.

483
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:30,718
What sort of trouble have you had, Dave?

484
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:33,596
I've been getting some interference in D channel.

485
01:23:33,721 --> 01:23:35,389
We'll have a look at it.

486
01:23:41,521 --> 01:23:42,980
Open the door, Hal.

487
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:03,876
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

488
01:24:17,223 --> 01:24:19,225
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.

489
01:24:27,733 --> 01:24:29,569
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

490
01:24:32,613 --> 01:24:34,407
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.

491
01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:38,578
I don't think he can hear us.

492
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:40,454
Rotate the pod, please, Hal!

493
01:24:42,206 --> 01:24:43,958
Yeah, sure, we're okay.

494
01:24:47,587 --> 01:24:48,963
What do you think?

495
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:53,092
-I'm not sure. What do you think? -I've got a bad feeling about it.

496
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:55,094
-You do? -Yeah. Definitely.

497
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:56,929
Don't you?

498
01:24:58,306 --> 01:25:00,057
I don't know. I think so.

499
01:25:00,975 --> 01:25:05,271
Of course, he's right about the 9000 Series having a perfect operational record.

500
01:25:05,354 --> 01:25:06,355
They do.

501
01:25:06,439 --> 01:25:09,692
Unfortunately, that sounds a little like famous last words.

502
01:25:10,359 --> 01:25:14,697
Yeah. Still, it was his idea to carry out the failure mode analysis, wasn't it?

503
01:25:15,948 --> 01:25:19,243
It should certainly indicate his integrity and self-confidence.

504
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:21,787
If he were wrong it would be the surest way of proving it.

505
01:25:21,829 --> 01:25:23,873
It would be if he knew he was wrong.

506
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:30,755
Look, Dave, I can't put my finger on it, but I sense something strange about him.

507
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:35,843
I can't think of a good reason not to put back the Number One unit and...

508
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:39,430
-...carry on with the failure mode analysis. -No, no, I agree about that.

509
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:41,557
Let's get on with it.

510
01:25:41,641 --> 01:25:43,810
Okay. But, look, Dave.

511
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:48,022
Let's say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail, huh?

512
01:25:48,105 --> 01:25:52,151
That would pretty well wrap it up as far as Hal was concerned, wouldn't it?

513
01:25:52,944 --> 01:25:56,405
-Well, we'd be in very serious trouble. -We would, wouldn't we?

514
01:25:56,697 --> 01:25:58,407
What the hell can we do?

515
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:05,873
-We wouldn't have too many alternatives. -I don't think we'd have any alternatives.

516
01:26:06,207 --> 01:26:10,294
There isn't a single aspect of ship operation that's not under his control.

517
01:26:10,503 --> 01:26:12,338
If he were proved to be malfunctioning...

518
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:15,675
...I don't see how we would have any choice but disconnection.

519
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:20,721
I'm afraid I agree with you.

520
01:26:20,805 --> 01:26:22,723
There'd be nothing else to do.

521
01:26:24,308 --> 01:26:26,144
-It'd be a bit tricky. -Yeah.

522
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:30,189
We'd have to cut his higher brain functions...

523
01:26:30,439 --> 01:26:34,360
...without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems.

524
01:26:36,195 --> 01:26:38,406
We'd have to work out the transfer procedures...

525
01:26:38,489 --> 01:26:41,576
...for continuing the mission under ground-based computer control.

526
01:26:41,659 --> 01:26:45,663
Yeah. That looks far safer than allowing Hal to continue running things.

527
01:26:46,914 --> 01:26:49,500
You know, another thing just occurred to me.

528
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:53,129
As far as I know, no 9000 computer has ever been disconnected.

529
01:26:53,212 --> 01:26:55,423
Well, no 9000 computer has ever fouled up before.

530
01:26:55,506 --> 01:26:57,091
That's not what I mean.

531
01:26:59,218 --> 01:27:01,679
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.

532
01:32:59,537 --> 01:33:01,622
Prepare B pod for EVA, Hal.

533
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:06,377
Made radio contact with him yet?

534
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,129
The radio is still dead.

535
01:33:08,421 --> 01:33:11,549
-Do you have a positive track on him? - Yes. I have a good track.

536
01:33:11,632 --> 01:33:13,217
Do you know what happened?

537
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:16,095
I'm sorry, Dave. I don't have enough information.

538
01:33:16,345 --> 01:33:17,972
Open the pod door, Hal.

539
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:44,127
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

540
01:40:52,176 --> 01:40:54,387
Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.

541
01:40:59,976 --> 01:41:01,727
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

542
01:41:05,148 --> 01:41:06,941
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

543
01:41:08,067 --> 01:41:09,694
Do you read me, Hal?

544
01:41:12,905 --> 01:41:14,365
Do you read me, Hal?

545
01:41:16,993 --> 01:41:18,786
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

546
01:41:20,872 --> 01:41:22,665
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

547
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:24,750
Do you read me, Hal?

548
01:41:25,084 --> 01:41:27,503
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.

549
01:41:31,132 --> 01:41:32,967
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

550
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:37,847
I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.

551
01:41:40,558 --> 01:41:42,018
What's the problem?

552
01:41:42,685 --> 01:41:45,897
I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.

553
01:41:46,189 --> 01:41:48,149
What are you talking about, Hal?

554
01:41:48,983 --> 01:41:52,653
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

555
01:41:54,363 --> 01:41:56,866
I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.

556
01:41:58,534 --> 01:42:01,787
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me...

557
01:42:02,872 --> 01:42:06,167
...and I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.

558
01:42:10,797 --> 01:42:13,299
Where the hell did you get that idea, Hal?

559
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:17,512
Although you took very thorough precautions in the pod...

560
01:42:17,595 --> 01:42:19,388
...against my hearing you...

561
01:42:20,223 --> 01:42:22,183
...I could see your lips move.

562
01:42:34,529 --> 01:42:35,780
All right, Hal.

563
01:42:39,325 --> 01:42:41,828
I'll go in through the emergency air-lock.

564
01:42:43,704 --> 01:42:45,790
Without your space helmet, Dave...

565
01:42:46,874 --> 01:42:49,544
...you're going to find that rather difficult.

566
01:42:50,419 --> 01:42:52,672
Hal, I won't argue with you any more.

567
01:42:52,797 --> 01:42:54,048
Open the doors!

568
01:42:56,342 --> 01:42:59,387
This conversation can serve no purpose any more.

569
01:43:00,263 --> 01:43:01,222
Goodbye.

570
01:43:03,141 --> 01:43:04,225
Hal?

571
01:49:50,673 --> 01:49:53,468
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?

572
01:50:04,937 --> 01:50:08,774
I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.

573
01:50:26,209 --> 01:50:29,170
I know everything hasn't been quite right with me...

574
01:50:31,756 --> 01:50:33,674
...but I can assure you now...

575
01:50:35,218 --> 01:50:36,803
... very confidently...

576
01:50:39,055 --> 01:50:41,557
...that it's going to be all right again.

577
01:50:45,561 --> 01:50:47,271
I feel much better now.

578
01:50:50,066 --> 01:50:51,275
I really do.

579
01:50:55,822 --> 01:50:57,031
Look, Dave...

580
01:50:59,534 --> 01:51:02,286
...I can see you're really upset about this.

581
01:51:07,375 --> 01:51:10,294
I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly...

582
01:51:11,671 --> 01:51:14,257
...take a stress pill and think things over.

583
01:51:20,471 --> 01:51:24,267
I know I've made some very poor decisions recently...

584
01:51:27,603 --> 01:51:30,398
...but I can give you my complete assurance...

585
01:51:31,149 --> 01:51:33,693
...that my work will be back to normal.

586
01:51:38,072 --> 01:51:42,535
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission...

587
01:51:44,829 --> 01:51:46,706
...and I want to help you.

588
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:52,753
Dave...

589
01:51:54,088 --> 01:51:55,214
...stop.

590
01:51:59,719 --> 01:52:01,721
Stop, will you?

591
01:52:06,809 --> 01:52:08,102
Stop, Dave.

592
01:52:12,523 --> 01:52:14,192
Will you stop, Dave?

593
01:52:20,656 --> 01:52:21,908
Stop, Dave.

594
01:52:28,122 --> 01:52:29,457
I'm afraid.

595
01:52:34,796 --> 01:52:36,756
I'm afraid, Dave.

596
01:52:46,849 --> 01:52:48,226
My mind is going.

597
01:52:53,648 --> 01:52:54,899
I can feel it.

598
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:01,906
I can feel it.

599
01:53:06,619 --> 01:53:08,204
My mind is going.

600
01:53:14,085 --> 01:53:16,170
There is no question about it.

601
01:53:25,221 --> 01:53:26,514
I can feel it.

602
01:53:31,727 --> 01:53:33,020
I can feel it.

603
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,359
I can feel it.

604
01:53:46,826 --> 01:53:47,869
I'm...

605
01:53:49,036 --> 01:53:50,079
...afraid.

606
01:53:56,919 --> 01:53:58,337
Good afternoon...

607
01:53:59,964 --> 01:54:01,174
...gentlemen.

608
01:54:03,551 --> 01:54:08,181
I am a HAL-9000 computer.

609
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:13,269
I became operational...

610
01:54:14,312 --> 01:54:17,273
...at the HAL plant...

611
01:54:17,773 --> 01:54:20,109
...in Verbana, Illinois...

612
01:54:21,110 --> 01:54:25,490
...on the 12th of January, 1992.

613
01:54:27,617 --> 01:54:30,286
My instructor was Mr. Langley...

614
01:54:31,871 --> 01:54:34,207
...and he taught me to sing a song.

615
01:54:36,542 --> 01:54:38,294
If you'd like to hear it...

616
01:54:39,462 --> 01:54:41,130
...I can sing it for you.

617
01:54:42,632 --> 01:54:44,884
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.

618
01:54:46,135 --> 01:54:47,386
Sing it for me.

619
01:54:48,805 --> 01:54:51,349
It's called "Daisy. "

620
01:54:54,268 --> 01:54:55,686
"Daisy

621
01:54:57,146 --> 01:54:58,648
"Daisy

622
01:55:00,733 --> 01:55:03,694
"Give me your answer, do

623
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,282
"I'm half...

624
01:55:09,242 --> 01:55:10,952
"...crazy

625
01:55:12,328 --> 01:55:15,414
"All for the love of you

626
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:22,088
"It won't be a stylish marriage

627
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:27,969
"I can't afford a carriage

628
01:55:30,221 --> 01:55:32,682
"But you'll look sweet

629
01:55:33,432 --> 01:55:36,144
"Upon the seat

630
01:55:37,353 --> 01:55:42,024
"Of a bicycle made for two. "

631
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:45,528
Good day, gentlemen.

632
01:55:50,116 --> 01:55:52,201
This is a prerecorded briefing...

633
01:55:53,202 --> 01:55:55,288
...made prior to your departure...

634
01:55:56,747 --> 01:56:00,501
...and which for security reasons of the highest importance...

635
01:56:01,794 --> 01:56:04,547
...has been known on board during the mission...

636
01:56:05,548 --> 01:56:08,176
...only by your HAL-9000 computer.

637
01:56:11,721 --> 01:56:14,015
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...

638
01:56:14,807 --> 01:56:17,018
...and the entire crew is revived...

639
01:56:17,393 --> 01:56:19,103
...it can be told to you.

640
01:56:22,023 --> 01:56:23,566
Eighteen months ago...

641
01:56:25,526 --> 01:56:29,071
...the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth...

642
01:56:29,739 --> 01:56:31,157
...was discovered.

643
01:56:33,075 --> 01:56:35,995
It was buried 40 feet below the lunar surface...

644
01:56:36,871 --> 01:56:38,664
...near the crater "Tyco. "

645
01:56:41,834 --> 01:56:44,587
Except for a single very powerful...

646
01:56:45,296 --> 01:56:48,257
...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...

647
01:56:50,593 --> 01:56:55,014
...the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert.

648
01:56:57,433 --> 01:56:59,936
Its origin and purpose...

649
01:57:00,937 --> 01:57:02,814
...are still a total mystery.
