13
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,511

- Fill this out.

24
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,512
- Guess l'm going to Cleveland.
- lt's a nice town.

25
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,279
Yeah, but Detroit's where l live.

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,198
Sarge, what's the chances
of a ride to Boone City?

27
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,880
You got orders?

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,036
- Sure.
- OK.

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,870
l haven't got anything now, but fill this out
and l'll call you if anything comes up.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,956
OK. l guess l'll wait.

31
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,911
l need a couple of men to give me
a hand with this out to a plane.

32
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,598
- OK.
- Let's go.

33
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,676
Let's go, huh?

34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,074
- l bet this thing weighs a ton.
- What's the matter? Tired or something?

35
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,236
OK, let's go. Out this way.

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,915
Fellas, take it easy down the stairs.

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,110
Got it?

38
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,074
- Take it easy going down the stairs.
- Oh, my aching back.

39
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,751
Derry.

40
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,713
- Derry. Captain Fred Derry.
- Coming!

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,837
- Parrish. Homer Parrish.
- Here!

42
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,995
- You Derry?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,269
- Parrish?
- Right.

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,836
Got a call from Base Ops.
There's a B-1 7 taking off for Boone City.

45
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,873
She's making a lot of stops,
but you'll get there tomorrow afternoon.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,470
- That's swell.
- OK, sign here.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,592
Boy, it sure is great to be going home.

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,156
- Here you go, sailor.
- Sign on the dotted...

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,070
- l'll do it for you.
- Think l can't spell my own name?

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,316
No, l... l just thought that...

51
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,396
l know, sarge. Thanks.

52
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,557
You'd better hurry up out there,
cos she's taking off soon.

53
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,592
Right, thanks.
Come on, sailor.

54
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,190
Where's your stuff?
Excuse us, Corporal.

55
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,548
- Boone City your home, sailor?
- Yes, Captain.

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,910
Forget the rank, chum. l'm out.

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,112
- Whereabouts do you live in Boone?
- On West 1 7th Street.

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,196
- Know where Jackson High is?
- Sure.

59
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,276
lt's a couple of blocks past it.

60
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,836
- Hiya, sarge.
- How are ya?

61
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,239
- My name's Fred Derry.
- Al Stephenson.

62
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,432
- And this is Homer... What is it, Homer?
- Parrish.

63
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,233
- Glad to know you.
- You from Boone too?

64
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,033
- Yeah, sure am.
- How long since you've been home?

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,435
A couple of centuries!

66
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,676
Let's sit in the radio compartment
for takeoff.

67
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Then we'll get in the nose and
get a nice view of the good old USA.

68
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,311
Look at that. Look at those
automobiles down there.

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,908
You can see them so plain,
you can see the people.

70
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,838
Yeah, looks like we're flying by road map.

71
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,635
- ls this your first ride in one of these?
- This is my first plane ride.

72
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,993
l saw plenty of flying, all right.
l was on a CV. That's a flattop.

73
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,432
But l never knew things
looked so pretty from up here.

74
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,516
Sure is beautiful.

75
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,632
l never thought so.
This used to be my office.

76
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,435
- Bombardier, weren't you?
- Yeah. That's where the bombsight was.

77
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,120
l spent a lot of time on my knees up there.

78
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,277
- Praying?
- Yeah, that too.

79
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,476
- Cigarette, Homer?
- Thanks.

80
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,830
lt's all right, l can get it.

81
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,710
Here, l've got a match, Captain.

82
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,757
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

83
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,950
- Anybody superstitious?
- No, go ahead.

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,036
Well, l am.

85
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,238
Boy, you ought to see me
open a bottle of beer.

86
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,954
- You got nothing to worry about.
- Thanks.

87
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,709
- l guess you saw a lot of action.
- No, l didn't see much of the war.

88
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,071
- l mean, the way you fellas did.
- You trying to kid the army?

89
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,794
No, l was stationed in
the repair shop, below decks.

90
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,876
Oh, l was in plenty of battles.

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,117
But l never saw a Jap
or heard a shell coming at me.

92
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,199
When we were sunk, all l know is
there was a lot of fire and explosions.

93
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,518
l was ordered topsides and overboard,
and l was burned.

94
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,111
When l came to l was on a cruiser,
and my hands were off.

95
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,629
- After that l had it easy.
- Easy?!

96
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,036
That's what l said.
They took care of me fine.

97
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,116
They trained me to use these things.

98
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,314
l can dial telephones, l can drive a car.
l can even put nickels in a jukebox.

99
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,396
l'm all right. But...

100
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,475
- But what, sailor?
- Well...

101
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,354
Well, you see, l've got a girl.

102
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,517
- She knows what happened to you?
- Sure. They all know.

103
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,950
But they don't know
what these things look like.

104
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,594
- What's your girl's name, Homer?
- Wilma.

105
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,518
She and l went to high school together.

106
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,315
- l'll bet Wilma's a swell girl.
- She is.

107
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,432
And it'll be all right, sailor.
You wait and see.

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,358
Yeah. Wait and see.

109
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,713
Wilma's only a kid. She's never seen
anything like these hooks.

110
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,711
Say, wait till l get home
and tell the folks about this trip.

111
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,789
l'm the first one in my family
that ever rode in an aeroplane.

112
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,794
- Hey, Al.
- Yeah?

113
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,230
Remember what it felt like
when you went overseas?

114
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,510
As well as l remember my own name.

115
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,596
l feel the same way now.

116
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,596
Only more so.

117
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,556
l know what you mean.

118
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,557
Just nervous out of the service, l guess.

119
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,311
The thing that scares me most is that
everybody's gonna try to rehabilitate me.

120
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,673
All l want's a good job, a mild future, and
a house big enough for me and my wife.

121
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,237
Give me that much
and l'm rehabilitated like that.

122
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,079
l'd say that's not too much to ask.

123
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,351
- Are you married, Al?
- Yep.

124
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,710
How long?

125
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,796
20 years.

126
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,916
20 years?!

127
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,036
Holy smoke!

128
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,479
We didn't even have 20 days
before l went over.

129
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,275
l married a girl l met
when l was in training in Texas.

130
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,153
You and your wife will have
a chance to get acquainted.

131
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,236
Yeah.

132
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,032
l wonder how Homer will make out
with that girl of his.

133
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,116
Wilma.

134
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,190
l hope Wilma is a swell girl.

135
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,870
The old home town
hasn't changed much.

136
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,036
No.

137
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,356
There's the golf course.
People are playing golf.

138
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,438
Just as if nothing had ever happened.

139
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,589
Hey, there's Jackson High football field.

140
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,111
Boy, l sure would like to have a dollar
for every forward pass l threw down there.

141
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,275
Good old Jackson High.

142
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,589
- Hey, that must be the new airport.
- Yeah, we're turning into it now.

143
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,109
Holy smoke!

144
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,393
l never knew
there were so many planes.

145
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,353
- And they're junking them.
- What?

146
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,510
Boy, oh boy.

147
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,074
What we could have done
with those in '43.

148
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,873
Yeah, l'll bet.

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,629
Some of 'em look brand-new.
From the factory to the scrapheap.

150
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,716
That's all they're good for now.

151
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,799
We gotta get out of the nose
while he sets her down.

152
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,478
There's the ballpark.

153
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,873
- How are the Beavers doing this season?
- They're in sixth place.

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,719
Ah! Still in second division!

155
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,120
- Hey, there's Butch's Place.
- Butch's?

156
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,959
Gosh, Butch has got himself
a neon sign.

157
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,277
Been to Butch's Place?
Butch Engle that runs it is my uncle.

158
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,076
Swell guy. Only the family don't think
he's respectable because he sells liquor.

159
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,239
- Best joint in town.
- Let's get together there sometime.

160
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,915
This is my street.

161
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,192
- 1 51 7?
- lt's the fourth house from here.

162
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,756
l wonder if Wilma's home.

163
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,914
How about us
going back to Butch's Place?

164
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,793
We'll have a couple of drinks
and then we can go home.

165
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,876
You're home now, kid.

166
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,712
Well, so long.

167
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,512
- Bye.
- So long, Homer.

168
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,836
- Where next?
- Just a minute, bud.

169
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,759
lt's Homer!
Momma! Daddy! Homer's here!

170
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,348
Wilma! Wilma!

171
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,756
Wilma, come on over!

172
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,235
- My boy.
- Oh, darling!

173
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,510
lt's good to see you.

174
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,876
- lsn't this wonderful?
- There's Wilma!

175
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,436
OK, let's go.

176
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,599
- Well...
- Don't. l'll carry it.

177
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,199
What's the matter, Ma?

178
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,116
lt's... it's nothing.

179
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,312
lt's just that your ma's
so glad to see you home.

180
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,396
Yeah, l know.

181
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,397
You gotta hand it to the navy. They sure
trained that kid how to use those hooks.

182
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,072
They couldn't train him to put his arms
around his girl, to stroke her hair.

183
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,911
- ls it the next turn up here?
- Yeah, the next turn on the left.

184
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,191
Hey, Fred, why don't we drop you first?

185
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,836
No, you're next.

186
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,039
And we're not going back
to Butch's for a drink either.

187
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,913
Feel as if l were going in to hit a beach.

188
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,876
Some barracks you got here.
What are you, a retired bootlegger?

189
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,549
Nothing as dignified as that.
l'm a banker.

190
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,834
- How much?
- Take your hand out of your pocket.

191
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,555
- You're outranked.
- Yes, sir, Captain, sir.

192
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,910
- Good luck, chum.
- Thanks.

193
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,391
Yes, l will.

194
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,794
Yes, sir.

195
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,195
One moment, please.
One moment, please!

196
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,675
- Who do you wish to see?
- Mrs Stephenson.

197
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,519
Just a minute.
l'll have to announce you first.

198
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,108
Put that phone down.
l'm her husband.

199
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,471
- You're Mr Stephenson?
- Sergeant Stephenson.

200
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,036
What did you expect?
A four-star general?

201
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,393
l'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

202
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,830
- Fourth floor.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,076
l'll get it, Peg.

204
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,116
Where's Mom?

205
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,995
- Da...
- Sh.

206
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,271
Who's that at the door, Peggy?

207
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,271
Peggy!

208
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,356
Rob, who was...?

209
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,914
- l look terrible.
- Who says so?

210
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,669
- lt isn't fair of you to bust in on us.
- l phoned you from Portland.

211
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,519
- You said you wouldn't be home for...
- We were lucky.

212
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,155
We got a plane to Welburn. l thought
we were gonna get stuck there,

213
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,033
but we came right through.

214
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,469
- Al, are you all right?
- Sure.

215
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,239
- Are you all right?
- Course l am.

216
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,599
- Let me look at you.
- Don't look now, l need a shave.

217
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,156
lf you don't mind, Mom...

218
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,111
Dad... darling.

219
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,398
l'll call the Kenworthys
and tell them we won't be over.

220
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,476
- The Kenworthys?
- Yes.

221
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,475
My son.
And my daughter.

222
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,875
l don't recognise you.
What's happened?

223
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,197
Just a few years of normal growth.
Don't you approve?

224
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,030
l don't know yet. l've got to have
more time to get to know you.

225
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,229
Hello?

226
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,514
Alice, this is Milly.
l'm terribly sorry, but we can't be over.

227
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,678
l mean, l'm terribly happy.

228
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,716
You see, Al...

229
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,910
My husband!

230
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,429
Yes. He's home.

231
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,116
Yes.

232
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,753
Yes.

233
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,793
- Freddy!
- Hortense.

234
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,388
Well, say!

235
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,589
Pat!

236
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,833
Pat, it's Freddy.
He's home again!

237
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,559
- Hello, Pop.
- l wish we'd known you were coming.

238
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,399
We'd have had the place
kinda cleaned up.

239
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,551
Well? Haven't you got anything
to say to your own son?

240
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,592
- Glad to see you, my boy.
- Look at him, Pat.

241
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,872
Look at your hero son. And look at
all those beautiful ribbons on his chest.

242
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,913
Go on, Freddy, tell your father how you
got those ribbons and what they mean.

243
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,031
- Where's Marie?
- Marie?

244
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,038
- Yeah. ls she out?
- Marie isn't here, Freddy.

245
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,754
- Will she be back soon?
- She's not living with us.

246
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,759
- She took an apartment downtown.
- Why didn't anybody write me about it?

247
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,509
We were afraid it might worry you,
you being so far away.

248
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,474
lt was inconvenient for Marie,
living here, after she took that job.

249
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,797
But we forwarded all your letters
and the allotment cheques.

250
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,876
She took a job? Where?

251
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,197
Uh... some nightclub.
l don't know just which one.

252
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,709
The poor girl works till all hours.

253
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,039
- Where does she live?
- Uh... Grandview Arms on Pine Street.

254
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,879
But there's nothing to worry about.
Marie's fine.

255
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,993
We saw her last Christmas.
She brought us some beautiful presents.

256
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,590
- Marie's a good-hearted girl.
- You know what time she goes to work?

257
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,554
Uh... well, about supper time, l imagine.

258
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,152
Do you mind if l leave my stuff here?
l'll pick it up later.

259
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,113
Sure, but aren't you gonna stay
and have a bite to eat?

260
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,595
No, thank you, Hortense.

261
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,235
Well, uh... so long, Pop.
l'll be back.

262
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,999
Well, it's... l'm glad
to have you home, my boy.

263
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,554
lt's good to be home, Pop. Bye.

264
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,836
Here, a cap.

265
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,235
Here's a samurai sword, Rob.

266
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,516
Thanks very much, Dad.

267
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,395
And here's a flag l found
on a dead Jap soldier.

268
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,876
All that writing is good-luck messages
from his relatives.

269
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,915
Yes, l know. The Japanese attach a lot of
importance to their family relationship.

270
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,350
Yeah. Yeah, entirely different from us.

271
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,789
- You were at Hiroshima, weren't you?
- Mm-hm.

272
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,950
Did you notice any of the effects of
radioactivity on the people who survived?

273
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,389
No, l didn't. Should l have?

274
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,432
We've been having lectures
in atomic energy at school.

275
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,553
Mr McLaglen, our physics teacher,
he says that we've reached the point

276
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,312
where the whole human race has either
got to find a way to live together, or else...

277
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,830
- Or else.
- That's right. Or else.

278
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,796
When you combine atomic energy with jet
propulsion and radar and guided missiles,

279
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,990
just think of the...

280
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,680
Oh, you're just kidding me, Dad.

281
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,429
You've been to all these places
and you've seen everything.

282
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,516
l've seen nothing.

283
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,752
l should have stayed home
and found out what was really going on.

284
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,836
l finished the dishes.

285
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,350
Why do you have to do that?
ls this the maid's night out?

286
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,109
Our maid took a night out three years ago
and we haven't seen her since.

287
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,119
But everything's all right because
l took a course in Domestic Science.

288
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,360
What's happened to this family? All this
atomic energy and scientific efficiency...

289
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,836
- lt was the war! You heard about that.
- Yeah.

290
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,916
All those problems on the home front.

291
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,349
We used to read about 'em
in Stars and Stripes.

292
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,835
We felt awfully sorry for the civilians.

293
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,990
You don't have to worry about us, though.
We can handle the problems. We're tough.

294
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,680
Rob, haven't you any homework?

295
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,831
Oh, sure.

296
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,520
- Night, Dad.
- l don't see why you have to go now.

297
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,189
Rob, aren't you going to take
the souvenirs Father brought you?

298
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,117
Oh, yes.

299
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,074
Thanks an awful lot, Dad,
for these... things.

300
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,634
- Good night. See you in the morning.
- Night.

301
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,555
- Night, Mom.
- Good night, darling.

302
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,791
Nice to have you around, Dad.
You'll get us back to normal.

303
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,796
Or maybe go nuts myself.

304
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,117
What do you think of the children?

305
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,708
The children?

306
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,197
l don't recognise them.
They've grown so old.

307
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,676
l tried to stop them, to keep them
just as they were when you left,

308
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,836
but they got away from me.

309
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,596
l guess Peggy has a lot of boyfriends.

310
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,676
She's very popular.

311
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,635
- ls she concentrating on anyone?
- She hasn't told me of anyone.

312
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,595
But you've, uh... told her
all the things she ought to know?

313
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,756
What, for instance?

314
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,796
Well, have you?

315
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,677
She's worked two years in a hospital.
She knows more than you or l ever will.

316
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,554
- Want a cigarette?
- Have you forgotten? l don't smoke.

317
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,513
- Sorry.
- lt's all right, darling.

318
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,589
Yeah, it's frightening.

319
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,676
What is?

320
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,558
Youth.

321
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,875
Didn't you meet young people
in the army?

322
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,470
No, they were all old men, like me.

323
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,318
Yes...

324
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,193
lt's terrible to be old, isn't it?

325
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,233
- Why don't you sit down and relax?
- l'm perfectly relaxed standing up.

326
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,914
ls there such a thing
as a drink in this house?

327
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,996
l'll see.

328
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,677
We haven't got bacon for Dad's breakfast.
l'll go out first thing and try to get some.

329
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,030
ls this all the liquor we have left?

330
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,116
Gosh, l'm afraid so.

331
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,110
l wish he'd given us some warning
he was going to get here today.

332
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,435
Don't worry, Mom.

333
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,031
l mean, so that we could have
gotten in some supplies of things.

334
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,675
Oh, Mother.
l know it's a little difficult, but...

335
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,357
that's only because Dad's
so crazy about you,

336
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,189
and he's been away so long
and missed you so terribly.

337
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,788
He can't just walk in
and immediately pick up...

338
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,595
Hey, l got a wonderful idea.
Let's go out on the town, the three of us.

339
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,278
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

340
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,914
- To celebrate the old man's homecoming.
- Not me.

341
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,190
No, no, no. You too.
The three of us.

342
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,629
l want to do something, see something.

343
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,433
l've been in jungles
and around savages so long,

344
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,597
l gotta find out
l'm back in civilisation again.

345
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,431
Be-bop, be-bop

346
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,991
Be-bop a-ree-bop

347
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,395
Rupert, another one in here.

348
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,949
l'll tell you, as l see it, we're headed
for bad times in this country.

349
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,471
Of course, we're in the backwash of the
war boom, but the tide is running out fast.

350
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,593
Next year, we'll see widespread
depression and unemployment.

351
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,711
Oh, have a cigar?

352
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,400
No, thanks. l've got my pipe.

353
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,398
Homer? Didn't you contract
the tobacco habit in the navy?

354
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,671
Just cigarettes, Mr Cameron. Thanks.

355
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,149
Wilma tells us you were in the Philippines.

356
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,556
l was around there, Mrs Cameron,
but l never saw anything.

357
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,231
- Did you meet General MacArthur?
- No, l didn't get to meet him.

358
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,035
- l've got a light, Mr Cameron.
- No, that's all right.

359
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,116
Got it.

360
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,396
- Luella.
- Yes, Dad?

361
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,673
l've always thought
he's such a handsome man.

362
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,756
- Who?
- General MacArthur.

363
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,432
Oh...

364
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,790
- May l help you with that, Mrs Parrish?
- No, you sit right down.

365
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,639
- Lemonade, Mrs Cameron?
- Thank you very much.

366
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,797
- Thought about getting a job, Homer?
- Well, l...

367
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,356
Father, it's much too soon for Homer
to be thinking about a job.

368
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,436
He's just out of the hospital.

369
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,157
Yes, but a few months from now the same
opportunities won't exist that exist today.

370
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,193
You might think about my business -
insurance. We've taken on veterans.

371
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,838
They make good salesmen, men who
have suffered some kind of disability.

372
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,909
Come down to the office
one of these days, we'll talk it over.

373
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,230
- l'm sorry, Mom.
- That's quite all right, Homer.

374
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,876
lt won't hurt the carpet a bit.
Luella, go and get me a dishrag.

375
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,958
There's another one for you, Homer.

376
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,116
Wilma will hold it for you.

377
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,997
No, thanks. lf you don't mind,
l think l'll go out and walk around a bit.

378
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,956
Where's Homer?

379
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,634
He went out.

380
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,198
lt's home, boys, home,
home we ought to be

381
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,711
Home, boys, home,
back in God's country

382
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,515
Pick-Up Caf.
There it is, driver. Stop here.

383
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,950
Don't you think it's time to go home
to bed and get some sleep?

384
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,358
Absolutely. Sleep. But first we've got
to stop and have one last little drink.

385
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,675
No arguments. One drink.

386
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,234
Come on in, driver, and have one with us.

387
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,638
(  ''Toot, Toot, Tootsie, Goodbye'')

388
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,716
Hey, Homer!

389
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,035
lt's good to see you, kid.

390
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,391
Your friend told me you were home,
but l didn't expect you...

391
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,272
Hiya, Captain!

392
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,119
Hiya, Homer, my old shipmate! Sit down.

393
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,119
So you took my advice and came to
Butch's? Come on, let's have a drink.

394
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,832
- Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Steve!

395
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,996
Am l happy to see you back home again.

396
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,635
Go ahead, shake, pal.
lt won't bite you.

397
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,673
- What'll you have?
- l've dreamed of hearing that question.

398
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,031
Before l went in the navy
Butch would never let me drink liquor.

399
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,515
He'd read me lectures
on the curse of drink.

400
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,790
But it's different now. l'm a veteran.

401
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,115
Give me a whiskey, Steve. Straight.

402
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,232
- How about it, Butch?
- Draw a beer for the navy.

403
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,476
- Butch, l ordered whiskey.
- Beer.

404
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,555
Beer.

405
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,912
l'm gonna take my trade to some other
joint where l don't have relatives.

406
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,112
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you home with the folks?

407
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,312
Well, they... they went to bed
and l wasn't sleepy,

408
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,398
so l thought ''Why not
come down and see Butch?''

409
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,114
Glad you did, Homer.

410
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,470
Well, here's to you, Butch.

411
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,516
How am l doing?

412
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,399
- Kid, you're doing great.
- Thanks.

413
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,351
Where did you leave Al?

414
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,597
Al's home in the swankiest
apartment house in town.

415
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,109
We'll never see him again.

416
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,754
Say, this is the best place we've been yet!

417
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,269
Hey, that's Al.

418
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,678
Hey, where you been?
We were just talking about you.

419
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,997
Oh, my aching back.

420
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,680
Hey, Milly. Peggy.
Step up and meet the gang.

421
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,870
- This is Homer, this is Fred.
- How do you do?

422
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,358
Homer and l were together at the Battle
of Lingayen Gulf, only we didn't know it!

423
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,198
- Hiya, bud.
- How do you do?

424
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,834
- Al, this is my uncle Butch.
- Bu...?

425
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,555
Oh! l hear you got a new neon sign, huh?
Good for you.

426
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,355
- Now the party can really get started, eh?
- This way, please.

427
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,119
- Let's sit. Milly, come on.
- Here's a good booth.

428
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,471
Fred... Sit down. Fred, where's
your wife? l want to meet her.

429
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,752
l haven't been able to find her.
She works in some nightclub.

430
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,269
We'll find it, Fred, before this night is out.

431
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,994
We'll deploy our forces
and comb the town. Won't we?

432
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,792
By all means.

433
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,990
We got the navy to convoy us. Huh?

434
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,396
First, Homer lost his hands.
He's got those hooks instead.

435
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,796
They don't worry him, so they don't
need to worry anybody else.

436
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,195
- Right.
- Now let's get seriously to work.

437
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,198
- Telephone.
- Thanks. Give them anything they want.

438
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,675
- Any kind of beer.
- What'll it be, folks?

439
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,279
- How are you?
- Hiya.

440
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,789
- Nice to see you. Looking well.
- Hello.

441
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,717
A little grey...

442
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,072
- (British accent) Well, cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers!

443
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,077
Homer. Homer.

444
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,395
OK, Butch.

445
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,476
Aren't you drinking?

446
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,790
- Excuse me, folks.
- Sure, Homer.

447
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,951
Gee, Butch, it's swell
to hear you playing again.

448
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,311
How about ''Lazy River''?
Remember that?

449
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,994
Sit down, Homer.

(  ''Lazy River'')

451
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,039
- Wilma phoned.
- Wilma?

452
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,076
- What did she want?
- You.

453
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,192
Oh, why can't they leave a guy alone?

454
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,232
Because they're fond of you, that's why.

455
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,033
What made you leave the house
and get them worried?

456
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,357
Oh, they... they got me nervous.

457
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,553
- How?
- lt's nothing. l don't wanna talk about it.

458
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,240
How'd they get you nervous?

459
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,237
Well, they...

460
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,117
They keep staring at these hooks,
or else they keep staring away from 'em.

461
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,550
You mean whatever they do is wrong.

462
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,276
Why don't they understand that all l want
is to be treated like everybody else?

463
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,391
Take Pop, for instance.

464
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,638
He was cleaning his pipe,
like l've seen him do a million times.

465
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,355
All of a sudden he got conscious
that he had hands and l didn't,

466
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,917
and he... he stopped cleaning his pipe
and he tried to hide his hands,

467
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,679
like he was guilty or something.

468
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,519
Give 'em time, kid. They'll catch on.

469
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,679
You know, your folks'll get used to you
and you'll get used to them.

470
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,519
Then everything'll settle down nicely.

471
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,870
Unless we have another war.

472
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,388
Then none of us have to worry, because
we'll all be blown to bits the first day.

473
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,116
So cheer up, huh?

474
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,478
Hey, Butch.

475
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,910
You know ''Among My Souvenirs'', huh?

476
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,237
There's nothing left for me

477
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,316

Yes. l've been that
as long as l can remember.

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,432
Oh, yeah. l've got a little woman
and two kiddies back there in the States.

494
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,633
- But let's not think of them now.
- Oh, you're so right.

495
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,194
This night belongs only to us.

496
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,430
That's the type of thing
people ought to be thinking about.

497
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,313
All right, l promise
l'll get right to work on it.

498
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,477
And there's one thing
l've been wanting to ask you.

499
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,639
You ask it, Peggy.
You mustn't feel shy with me.

500
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,476
Why don't you call your wife?

501
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,557
l don't know her number.
l couldn't find it in the phone book.

502
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,877
Phone book?!
We don't need to do any telephoning.

503
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,956
We're all set.

504
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,753
What you need is a drink.

505
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,394
- Good night, everybody. l'm going home.
- Why?

506
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,718
- l've got to. Butch is gonna drive me.
- Oh, no, no.

507
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,717
- No, you can't...
- lt's quite all right.

508
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,274
- Don't leave. l'll be right back.
- Good night.

509
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,598
- Good night.
- Poor kid. He's got to go home.

510
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,790
Doesn't that put any ideas in your head?

511
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,876
Yes.

512
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,436
l'd love to.

513
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,276
Lights out, Steve.

514
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,679
Oh! Ho-ho-ho!

515
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,995
Where do we go next, old pal, old pal?

516
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,076
Just follow me, old pal.

517
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,630
Step.

518
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,149
- Good night, Al.
- Good night. Nice party.

519
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,195
This it, Fred?

520
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,276
lt looks like it.

521
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,592
Ooh, silly.

522
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,871
Good night, Milly. Many thanks
for a most enjoyable evening.

523
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,275
- Good night, Fred.
- Good night, Al.

524
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,356
Best of luck to you.

525
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,191
- l'll give him your message.
- You do that.

526
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,598
(British accent) And good night to you,
Peggy. lt has indeed been a pleasure.

527
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,473
- Yes, Fred. See you soon.
- By all means.

528
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,238
Ooh!

529
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,316
l beg your pardon.

530
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,276
Good night.

531
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,514
We'd better wait and see if he gets in.

532
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,311
l don't think he even knows
if this is the right place.

533
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,475
Come on.

534
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,956
Up...

535
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,952
- Where are we all going now?
- Don't ask. We want it to be a surprise.

536
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,237
- They make a lovely couple, don't they?
- (laughs) Yeah.

537
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,591
l think they'll be very happy together.

538
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,598
- Who are you?
- Don't you remember? l'm Peggy.

539
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,036
Oh, yes. Peggy.

540
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,396
l'm not that Peggy.

541
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,716
That's too bad.

542
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,677
As l remember, when you lie
flat on your back you snore.

543
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,954
Where's your hand?

544
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,596
Give me your hand.

545
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,951
..my souvenirs

546
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,276
..my souvenirs

547
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,756
..my souvenirs

548
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,995
- ls Fred all right?
- Yes. He's all right.

549
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,112
- You'll be comfortable here.
- Sure, Mom. Night.

550
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,196
Night, dear.

551
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,796
- Night.
- Night.

552
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,396
Bandits at four o'clock.

553
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,716
lt's all right, buddy.

554
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,196
You got him.

555
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,356
He's hit.

556
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,680
She's on fire. She's on fire!

557
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,109
The fire's spreading.
lt's Gadorsky.

558
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,357
There goes number four.
She's breaking formation.

559
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,357
Watch out for fighters.

560
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,631
lt's spread to the wing.
The wing's on fire!

561
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,548
She's out of control.
She's out of control!

562
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,556
She's going down!

563
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,432
Hey, you guys, jump!

564
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,516
Get outta there! Bail out!

565
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,438
Gadorsky!
Gadorsky, get out of that plane!

566
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,994
Two chutes open.

567
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,076
Three.

568
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,838
- The rest of you guys...
- Fred.

569
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,757
- ..get out!
- Fred, wake up!

570
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,871
- Gadorsky! Gadorsky!
- Wake up!

571
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,231
- She's burning up! Get out! Get out!
- Fred! Fred, wake up!

572
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,909
She's burning up!
She's gonna hit. Look out!

573
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,237
lt's all right, Fred. Go back to sleep.

574
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,831
Go back to sleep.

575
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,916
Go back to sleep, Fred.

576
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,116
There's nothing to be afraid of.

577
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,268
All you have to do is...
go to sleep and rest.

578
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,116
Go to sleep.

579
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,996
Go to sleep, Fred.

580
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,797
Go to sleep and rest.

581
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,079
Go to sleep, Fred.

582
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,156
Go to sleep.

583
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,235
All you have to do is rest.

584
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,476
Go to sleep.

585
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,716
Oh, l'm terribly sorry l woke you up.

586
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,035
Oh, that's all right. But...

587
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,913
l know. You're about to say ''Where am l?''

588
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,238
l'll tell you later, Fred.
You can sleep as long as you want.

589
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,715
Did he fly 1 7 s or 24s?

590
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,638
l don't know.

591
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,433
- What group was he with?
- He didn't say.

592
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,074
Well, what did you two talk about?

593
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,237
Rob, you'd better hurry up.
You'll be late for school.

594
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,237
Holy Moses!

595
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,157
l'll see you later. Bye.

596
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,792
Oh, excuse me, Captain.
l'm Rob Stephenson, Peggy's brother.

597
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,639
She's in there in the kitchen,
fixing your breakfast.

598
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,716
l've gotta run. Goodbye.

599
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,516
- Hello.
- Hello.

600
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,156
Sit down.

601
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,916
- Here, this may help.
- Thanks.

602
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,996
Sit down.

603
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,633
You're Peggy, aren't you?

604
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,716
For the last time, yes.

605
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,037
- Want some eggs?
- You think l can take 'em?

606
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,799
Sure, they'll be good for you.

607
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,639
- Like 'em scrambled?
- Any way you cook 'em.

608
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,716
Good.

609
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,236
Sleep all right?

610
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,396
Wonderful.

611
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,476
That's good.

612
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,515
Can l help you with any of that business?

613
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,871
You can pour the coffee
if you want some.

614
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,194
Do you mind if l ask you
a personal question?

615
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,629
No.

616
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,910
Where did you sleep last night?

617
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,634
On the couch.

618
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,911
- That's terrible.
- What's terrible?

619
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,433
l should have had enough sense to go to
a hotel and not come here, bothering you.

620
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,596
You didn't bother anybody, Fred.

621
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,314
We're very glad to have you here.

622
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,069
Besides, you couldn't have
gotten a room in a hotel.

623
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,315
Did l get out of line with you?

624
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,316
No. Not really.

625
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,676
That's good.
Cos, you see, l'm married.

626
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,756
Yes, l know.

627
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,430
l must have got pretty plastered last night.

628
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,790
You had nothing on my dad.

629
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,911
Your dad? Who's he?

630
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,188
Don't you remember Al?

631
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,916
Oh, Al. Yeah, good old Al.

632
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,077
- Where is he?
- Still asleep, l guess.

633
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,833
So you're Al's daughter.

634
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,520
You've got it all straight now.

635
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,430
- l feel a lot better.
- That's good.

636
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,432
- Are you married, Peggy?
- No.

637
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,677
You've hardly had time.
You must have been engaged, though.

638
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,552
No.

639
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,389
Why not? What's the matter
with the guys around here?

640
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,069
l guess the best of 'em
are already married.

641
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,639
- Good morning, Fred.
- Good morning, Mrs, uh...

642
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,911
- Milly's the name.
- Thanks, Milly.

643
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,110
When Al wakes up, tell him how much l...

644
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,471
You're not going? You haven't even
finished your breakfast.

645
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,515
l haven't got much of an appetite.
Besides, l've got to get downtown.

646
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,393
Maybe now l can get into
where my wife lives.

647
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,389
l'll drive you, Fred. l've got to get to work
at the hospital. l'll just be a minute.

648
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,910
- l must've acted disgracefully last night.
- No.

649
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,670
You just fell in with bad company
at Butch's and got stinking.

650
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,509
You see, the whole trouble was,
l couldn't find Marie - that's my wife.

651
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,790
l didn't know she had a job
in a nightclub.

652
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,789
Could happen to anyone. lf Al had come
home later, we wouldn't have been in.

653
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,071
- He wouldn't have known where we were.
- How is Al?

654
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,998
- We don't know yet.
- Ready, Fred.

655
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,749
Well, when he wakes up you can tell him
l think he's a pretty lucky guy.

656
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,156
- Thank you, Fred.
- Goodbye. Thanks a lot for everything.

657
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,633
Goodbye.

658
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,716
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, dear.

659
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,236
(thud)

660
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,396
(shower starts)

661
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,029
Among my souvenirs

662
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,116
Among my...

663
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,037
- What'd you do before the war, Fred?
- l was a fountain attendant.

664
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,116
- A what?
- Soda jerk.

665
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,076
- Oh.
- Surprised?

666
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,156
Yes, a little.

667
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,113
l'll bet you mixed up
a fine ice-cream soda.

668
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,391
You're darn right.
l was an expert behind that fountain.

669
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,274
l'd toss a scoop of ice cream in the air,
adjust for velocity, altitude,

670
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,233
and - wham! - in the cone every time.

671
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,670
l figure that's where
l really learned to drop bombs.

672
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,872
What do you think you'll do now?

673
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,231
l'm not going back to that drugstore.

674
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:05,639
Somehow or other, l can't figure myself
getting excited about a root-beer float.

675
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,035
l don't know just what l will do,

676
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,199
but l'm gonna take plenty of time
looking around.

677
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:18,917
l guess after all the places you've been,
Boone City looks pretty dreary to you.

678
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,077
Not from where l'm sitting right now.

679
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,476
That's not just a line. l really meant it.

680
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,194
- Who's that?
- lt's me, Milly.

681
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,270
- l brought your breakfast.
- Oh! Thanks.

682
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,713
- Didn't think you'd be up for hours.
- l had a dream. l dreamt l was home.

683
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,310
l've had that same dream
hundreds of times before.

684
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,513
This time l wanted to find out
if it's really true.

685
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,154
- Am l really home?
- Looks like it.

686
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:20,230
And you're going to be royally treated.
You're having breakfast in bed.

687
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,916
l seem to have a vague recollection that
we had a couple of children. ls that right?

688
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,430
- That's right.
- Whatever became of them?

689
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,996
Rob's gone to school
and Peggy's driving downtown with Fred.

690
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,156
Fred? Oh.

691
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,555
Oh, yeah, Fred.

692
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,636
He's a great guy.

693
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,956
All right?

694
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,156
There's your breakfast.
l have work to do.

695
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,273
Well, it was nice knowing you, Peggy.

696
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,312
That sounds like a permanent goodbye.

697
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,590
You never know.

698
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,951
You and your wife
must come up to dinner.

699
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,355
That'd be fine.

700
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,948
Oh, there's one thing more.

701
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,595
About that dream l had last night.
l've had it before.

702
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,551
- l'm sorry l bothered you with it.
- l...

703
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:37,674
But you were very kind, and you didn't
even mention it this morning.

704
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,270
As a matter of fact,
you've been swell about everything.

705
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,789
They ought to put you in mass production.

706
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,150
- Goodbye, Fred.
- Bye.

707
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,269
Maybe l'd better wait and see if you get in.

708
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,356
Maybe that's a good idea.

709
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,676
Bye.

710
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,911
All right! All right!

711
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,588
Say, what's the big i...?

712
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,915
- Freddy!
- Hiya, babe.

713
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,400
Freddy, darling,
why didn't you let me know?

714
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,671
- You didn't give me time to fix my face.
- You look all right.

715
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,588
Oh, Freddy, darling, l'm so excited!
l can't believe it's you!

716
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,315
Come on in, honey,
where l can look at you.

717
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,396
Oh, you're marvellous!

718
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,910
All those ribbons!
You gotta tell me what they all mean.

719
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,996
But not now.

720
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,957
Let me look at you.
But how did you know l was here?

721
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,914
- l got in yesterday, went to Pop's house...
- Yesterday?! Why didn't...?

722
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,828
l came here, but you'd gone to work.
l went from one nightclub to another.

723
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,155
- You were looking for me?
- For my wife.

724
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,510
Well, you've found her now.

725
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,155
l wonder how Fred's getting along.

726
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,316
Fred's able to take care of himself.

727
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,833
l'm not so sure. lt isn't easy for air force
glamour boys when they get grounded.

728
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,193
When you've been in the infantry, any
change is bound to be an improvement.

729
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,754
Stop fussing around
and sit down and talk to me.

730
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,553
All right, Sergeant.
Gosh, you've got tough.

731
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,750
- ls this all the cream?
- That's all.

732
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,350
Fine situation when a man can't
get enough to eat in his own home.

733
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,516
- Look at my pants.
- What about them?

734
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,871
Too big! Gives you an idea
of what the war did to my waistline.

735
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,753
- You holding your stomach in?
- No, it's disappeared.

736
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,713
l'll have to take
all my old clothes to be altered.

737
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,990
l wouldn't be in too much of a hurry.

738
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,749
A couple of weeks of heavy eating
and those pants will fit perfectly.

739
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,876
Don't answer it.

740
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,788
Hello?

741
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,990
Oh, yes. He's here.

742
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,634
For me?
lf it's the War Department, l'm out.

743
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,876
- lt's Mr Milton.
- Who?

744
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,230
- Mr Milton at the bank.
- Oh.

745
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,756
He'll be right on.

746
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,832
Hello?

747
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,516
Oh, yes, Mr Milton.

748
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,553
Yeah, it sounds good to hear yours.

749
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,996
Yes.

750
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,197
Yes, indeed, Mr Milton. Yeah...

751
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,276
Well, not too bad, no.

752
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,430
Yes. Why, of course.

753
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,630
lt's very kind of you to say that.

754
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,557
Mm-hm.

755
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,919
Mm-hm.

756
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,190
Yes.

757
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,471
Well, l'll... l'll certainly drop in.

758
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:38,277
Oh, she's fine, thank you.

759
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,192
Yes, they're fine too.

760
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,353
Well...

761
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,833
l...

762
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,155
That's...

763
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,919
Thank you, Mr Milton.

764
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,190
Yes, good...

765
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,072
Good...

766
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,872
Good... goodbye.

767
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,519
Mr Milton.

768
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:07,395
He calls every day to see if you're home.
l guess they want you back at the bank.

769
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,873
- He wants me to drop in and talk about it.
- You're not going to work right away?

770
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,514
You ought to rest awhile, take a vacation.

771
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,596
l've got to make money.

772
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,951
Last year it was kill Japs,
and this year it's make money.

773
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,958
- We're all right for the time being.
- Mm.

774
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,719
Why do they have to bother me
the first day l get home?

775
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:29,913
Why not give me time to get used to
my family? Come over here and sit down.

776
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,919
- Chair's liable to break.
- We can't be worrying about chairs.

777
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,794
Not when they want me back
in a nice fat job in a nice fat bank!

778
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,151
- You don't seem very happy about it.
- l'm not.

779
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,717
- Why not, darling?
- l keep thinking about the other guys.

780
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,638
All the ones who haven't got you.

781
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,548
- You're crazy.
- No, too sane for my own good.

782
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,360
- Yes, sir?
- Wasn't this Bullard's Drugstore?

783
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,914
Yes, but it was taken over
by the Midway chain.

784
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,828
- Oh.
- But old Mr Bullard's still here.

785
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,714
- He's right over there by the phone.
- Thanks.

786
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,470
Yes, sir?

787
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,989
- Oh, Fred!
- Hello, Mr Bullard.

788
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,590
- lt's good to see you again.
- lt's good to see you.

789
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,518
- Say, what happened here?
- Well, l sold out.

790
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,234
Midway had been after
this location for a long time.

791
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,318
- Didn't he used to work here?
- Yes, he did.

792
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,431
l'll bet he's back looking for a job.

793
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,872
And he'll get it, too,
with all those ribbons on his chest.

794
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,438
Well, nobody's job is safe
with all these servicemen crowding in.

795
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,191
- Meet our new manager, Mr Thorpe.
- Oh, no, l don't think so.

796
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,869
l just dropped in to say hello to you.
l don't want that old job back.

797
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,709
Yes, l know.
But Midway's a big, big outfit.

798
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,400
You never can tell. Come along.

799
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,638
- Thank you, Mr Bullard.
- l'll see you later.

800
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,514
- l see you had a splendid war record.
- Just average, Mr Thorpe.

801
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:52,998
Since this business changed hands, we're
not obliged to give you your old job back.

802
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,430
l wasn't thinking of my old job.
l'm looking for a better one.

803
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,632
What are your qualifications?
Your experience?

804
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,514
Two years behind a soda fountain,
three years behind a Norden bombsight.

805
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:07,599
Yeah. While in the army, did you have
any experience in procurement?

806
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,915
- No.
- Purchasing of supplies, materials?

807
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,996
No, l just dropped bombs.

808
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,076
- Did you do any personnel work?
- No.

809
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,829
But as an officer you surely
had to act in an executive capacity,

810
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,713
you had to command men,
be responsible for the morale?

811
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,037
l was only responsible for
getting the bombs on the target.

812
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,392
- l didn't command anybody.
- l'm sure that required great skill.

813
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,798
But, unfortunately, we've no
opportunities for that with Midway Drugs.

814
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,955
Yeah.

815
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,870
We may be able to provide an opening as
assistant to Mr Merkel, the floor manager.

816
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,150
- ''Sticky'' Merkel?
- Clarence Merkel.

817
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,556
That's the fella. He was
my assistant at the soda fountain.

818
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,875
He's a very good man.

819
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,028
lncidentally, your work would require
part-time duties at the soda fountain.

820
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,435
- At what salary?
- 32.50 per week.

821
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,189
32.50! l used to make
over $400 a month in the air force.

822
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,276
The war is over, Derry.

823
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,790
l think l'll look around, Mr Thorpe.
Thank you, very much.

824
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,876
And take care of that cold.

825
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,555
- l gotta run. l'll drop back later.
- All right, Fred. Bye.

826
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,636
Excuse me, girls.

827
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,352
No, conditions are none too good
right now, Al.

828
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,789
Considerable uncertainty in business.

829
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,559
Strikes. Taxes still ruinous.

830
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,917
- You like that cigar?
- Yes, Mr Milton. lt's fine.

831
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,635
Hard to get those in the war, but they
come in regularly from Havana now.

832
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,435
Things will readjust themselves in time.

833
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,074
We want you back here with us, Al.

834
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:28,230
That's very nice of you, Mr Milton,
but l noticed Steese sitting at my old desk.

835
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:33,034
- l wouldn't want to push him out.
- Steese'll stay right there.

836
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,355
You're moving up.

837
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:42,309
What do you say to being vice president in
charge of small loans, at $1 2,000 a year?

838
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,715
What do you say to that, huh?

839
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,559
l... l'd say it can't be true.

840
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:49,636
Job's there, Al.

841
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,275
- You're the man for it.
- What makes you think l am, Mr Milton?

842
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:57,075
Well, your war experience
would prove invaluable to us here.

843
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,193
See, we have many new problems.
This Gl Bill of Rights, for instance.

844
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,711
lt involves us in consideration
of all kinds of loans to ex-servicemen.

845
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,276
We need a man who understands
the soldiers' problems,

846
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:15,350
and who's well grounded in the
fundamental principles of sound banking.

847
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,755
ln other words, you.

848
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,916
Well? What do you say, Al?

849
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,037
Well, l'm... l'm overwhelmed.

850
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,116
Of course. Of course.

851
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,078
- Will you bring them in now, please?
- Yes, sir.

852
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,919
- l'd thought of taking it easy...
- Naturally.

853
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,953
After what you've been through,
you need a vacation. Thank you.

854
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,277
You're entitled to enjoy life
before you come back to work.

855
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,757
- lt's very kind of you to say that.
- When you get a chance...

856
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,749
This contains reports with all the figures
on our Small Loans Department.

857
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,678
Just in your spare time, of course.

858
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,076
Oh, the briefcase
is a slight gift from the bank.

859
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,476
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr Milton.

860
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,752
- Glad to have you back with us, Al.
- Thank you, sir.

861
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,554
Sweetheart, l knew you'd be heartbroken.

862
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,913
But listen, you can get another blonde.
What about Sylvia Mack?

863
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,349
Oh, you're crazy.
l think her legs are cute.

864
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,517
l'm sorry too, but he doesn't
want me to work nights.

865
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,870
He says it's inconvenient.

866
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,550
Oh, he's wonderful. And how!

867
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:34,956
Snappy uniform, a whole
ribbon counter on his chest.

868
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,878
- Sure, l'll bring him in sometime.
- (door bell)

869
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,595
Hey, the door bell's ringing.
l guess that's my Freddy.

870
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,676
Bye.

871
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,395
Hey, Marie, have you got an extra key?
l'd like to have it.

872
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,159
- What are you looking at?
- Holy smoke, honey!

873
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,750
That's the first time l've ever seen you
in civilian clothes.

874
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,589
Well, from now on, honey,
you're not gonna see me in anything else.

875
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,508
l just got it out of the mothballs
over at Pop's house.

876
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,070
l called up the Blue Devil.

877
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,998
- Who?
- The nightclub. l told 'em l'm through.

878
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,588
- Oh, swell.
- But let's go there for dinner.

879
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,553
l'd like to introduce you.
They've heard all about you.

880
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,117
Anything you say, honey.
Here's some perfume l bought in Paris.

881
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,356
Oh! Fleurette No. 5!

882
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,553
And this scarf's cute!
To think of having things from Paris!

883
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,559
Freddy, honey, you're just a big hunk
of heaven. What's that a picture of?

884
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,716
Bomb hits on Dsseldorf.

885
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,596
That's my B-1 7.

886
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,109
What are those?

887
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,199
- Little black flowers that grow in the sky.
- Huh?

888
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,836
- Hey, that's me!
- l had it pasted above my bombsight.

889
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,838
- lt took a lot of trips over Germany.
- That's sweet.

890
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,750
The guys'd kid me about it. They'd take
a look at it and ask ''Who's the dame?''

891
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,839
When l told 'em it was my wife they'd say
''Nobody's got a wife looks like that.''

892
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,110
''What's her telephone number?''

893
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,356
When we go out
will you wear your uniform?

894
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,913
- Oh, no.
- For my sake.

895
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,157
- l'm sorry, baby.
- l'd be so proud to be out with you.

896
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,236
Won't you, please?

897
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,555
Well, seeing as it's you and seeing as l
can't find any place to hang it, all right.

898
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,432
But it's the last time.

899
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,999
lf you don't like me in civilian clothes,
we'll just have to stay here all the time.

900
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,475
Would that be so bad?

901
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,189
You gotta get yourself some new clothes.
That suit's awful.

902
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:40,758
l know, it's terrible. But they tell me
you can't buy anything new now.

903
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,713
l know where you can get
snappy suits made to order.

904
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,879
- You mean there's a black market?
- lf you know the right people,

905
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,560
and don't care how much you spend...

906
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:55,037
We're not worrying about that, baby.
l got money, cash money.

907
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:58,914
Nearly 1 ,000 bucks,
from the good old US Treasury.

908
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,793
Oh, now you look wonderful!

909
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,876
You look like yourself.

910
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,560
lt's so wonderful,
l can hardly believe it.

911
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,036
Now we can have a real honeymoon,
without a care in the world.

912
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:14,392
Just as if nothing had ever happened.
Just as if you'd never gone away.

913
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,034
We're right back where we started.

914
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,038
- Don't say that, Marie.
- Don't say what?

915
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:24,153
That we're right back where we started.
We never wanna be back there.

916
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,589
But why not? What is it?
What's the matter?

917
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:33,478
Oh, never mind. Skip it. l went back to the
drugstore today and l just got reminded.

918
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,873
Come on, let's go out and have fun.

919
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,795
- Hello, Wilma.
- Good afternoon, Mr Parrish.

920
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,309
- Have you seen Homer?
- He's in the woodshed.

921
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,228
He wants to practise shooting.

922
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,079
So he can go hunting.

923
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,158
You'd have thought he'd seen
enough shooting in the war.

924
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,272
l guess he just wants to find
something to occupy himself.

925
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,436
l guess so.

926
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,994
l wish there was something
l knew to do for him.

927
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,317
His mother and l have tried
to make him feel at home,

928
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,115
but he just keeps to himself all the time.

929
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,433
Hello, Luella.
What are you kids doing?

930
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,994
Nothing. We're just playing.

931
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,516
That's his girl. They're engaged.

932
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,432
- Oh. Hello, Wilma.
- Hello.

933
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,314
- Looking for something?
- No. Go right ahead.

934
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,278
- How'd you do, Homer?
- Only fair.

935
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,880
Well, you did fine.

936
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,956
l'll do better.

937
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,075
l've been wanting to talk to you.

938
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:16,876
- What about?
- About everything. About us.

939
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,594
What about us?
We're all right, aren't we?

940
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,837
No. Listen to me, Homer.

941
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,916
l'm listening.

942
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,352
You wrote me that when you got home
you and l were going to be married.

943
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,553
lf you wrote that once, you wrote it
100 times. lsn't that true?

944
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,513
Yes, but things are different now.

945
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,271
Have you changed your mind?

946
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,312
Have l said anything
about changing my mind?

947
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,237
No.

948
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:53,195
That's just it.
You haven't said anything about anything.

949
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,479
- That's not loaded, is it?
- Of course it isn't.

950
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,909
Don't you think l know
how to handle a gun?

951
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,996
l don't know what to think, Homer.

952
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:10,194
All l know is, l was in love with you when
you left and l'm in love with you now.

953
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,279
Other things may have changed,
but that hasn't.

954
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,436
You wanna see how the hooks work?

955
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,630
You wanna see the freak?

956
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,508
All right, l'll show you!

957
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,673
Take a good look!

958
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,519
l didn't mean anything, Homer.

959
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,154
l was only...

960
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,314
l'm... l'm sorry, Luella.

961
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,908
lt isn't your fault.

962
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,679
Go on and play with your friends.

963
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,589
l know, Wilma. l was wrong.

964
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,029
l shouldn't have acted like that.

965
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,596
lt wasn't her that... burned my hands off.

966
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:20,277
l'll be all right.
l just gotta work it out myself.

967
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:25,394
- l could help you, Homer, if you'd let me.
- l've gotta work it out myself.

968
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,956
All l've wanted is for people
to treat me like anybody else,

969
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,036
instead of pitying me.

970
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,992
l guess it's hard for them to do that.

971
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,511
l've just gotta learn to get used to it
and pay no attention.

972
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,189
- Couldn't l...?
- No! l've gotta do it myself.

973
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,838
- Yes?
- OK, Pop, l'm going to bed now.

974
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,996
Be right with you, Homer.

975
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,429
- Night, son.
- Good night, Pop.

976
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,516
Thanks.

977
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,110
- Hello, babe.
- What you got there?

978
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:49,949
Our supper. Cream of corn soup,
potato salad, salami and liverwurst.

979
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,958
We're going to Jackie's Hot Spot.
l made a reservation.

980
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:56,470
- We're eating at home.
- Are you sick or something?

981
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,556
No, dear. Broke.

982
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,196
- Broke?
- You got it.

983
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,914
Well, what happened?
Where did it go to?

984
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,429
We spent it, babe.
That's what happened.

985
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,715
l didn't tell you
the money was almost gone

986
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,150
because l kept hoping
l was gonna land a good job.

987
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,158
But l'm not going to get one,

988
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:22,559
so we'll have to forget about Jackie's Hot
Spot and the Blue Devil and all the rest.

989
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,830
Why couldn't you get a job?
Have you tried?

990
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,112
Sure. l've been all over town -
all the employment offices and the USES.

991
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,630
They say l ought to spend
a couple of years as an apprentice,

992
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,593
or go to a trade school.

993
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,598
A couple of years,
with you going to kindergarten.

994
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,075
And what would l be doing
in the meantime?

995
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,431
You can always help me
with my homework.

996
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,950
- Fred.
- Yeah?

997
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,516
- Are you really all right?
- Of course l'm all right. Why?

998
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,438
l mean, in your mind. ls anything...?

999
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,189
My mind?! You mean
you think l'm going goofy?

1000
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:04,196
l've been wondering.

1001
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,993
What was Gadowsky?

1002
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,112
- Where did you hear about him?
- You talk in your sleep.

1003
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,630
Something's on fire
and you want somebody to get out.

1004
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,035
You keep saying ''Gadowsky! Gadowsky!''

1005
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,037
Gadorsky.

1006
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:21,357
He was a friend of mine, a B-1 7 pilot.
He got it over Berlin.

1007
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,278
- Can't you get it out of your system?
- Oh, sure

1008
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,791
The war's over. You won't get anyplace
till you stop thinking about it.

1009
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,152
- Come on, snap out of it!
- OK, honey, l'll do that

1010
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,554
l didn't tell you, Fred,
but l got a little money saved.

1011
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,636
Dinner's on me tonight.

1012
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,150
You'd better keep on saving it.
lt might come in handy sometime.

1013
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,714
l appreciate the offer,
but we're eating at home.

1014
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,912
Well, l'm hungry.
l'm going out by myself.

1015
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,715
- You're not going. You'll eat what l cook.
- Let go of me!

1016
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,595
When we married, the justice of the peace
said ''For better, for worse''. Remember?

1017
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:02,029
- This is the ''worse''.
- When do we get the ''better''?

1018
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,230
When l get wise to myself, l guess.

1019
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:07,397
When l realise l'm not an officer
and a gentleman any more,

1020
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,875
l'm just another soda jerk out of a job.

1021
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,677
Go and sit down and read a magazine or
listen to the radio while l cook the soup.

1022
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:20,119
l'll fix you a nice meal, honey.

1023
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,358
Just like l used to do behind
the fountain, before the war.

1024
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:41,359
Perfume and Cosmetics
is our outstanding feature.

1025
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:45,268
lt accounts for 34/. of gross intake
and an even higher proportion of profits.

1026
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,949
As you will surmise, our customers
in this department are women.

1027
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,389
Yes, l'd surmised that.

1028
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,435
You must familiarise yourself with the
correct pronunciation of all the perfumes.

1029
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,233
- Rve Romantique.
- That means Romantic Dream.

1030
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,399
- You speak French?
- Sticky, just enough to go to Paris bars.

1031
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:07,638
Let's get one thing straight, Derry.
The name ''Sticky'' is out.

1032
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,035
Yes, Mr Merkel. l understand.

1033
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:14,517
This week we're pushing the new
Champagne Bubble Bath. $1 .98.

1034
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,598
Down here are some special... Come here.

1035
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:21,395
Down here are some
specially made-up toilet sets...

1036
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,077
- Thank you.
- Morning, Mr Latham.

1037
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,636
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr Stephenson.

1038
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,952
What have we here?
The Bretton Woods Agreement?

1039
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,676
That's a Mr Novak, waiting over there.
He's applying for a Gl loan.

1040
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,951
- Oh, good. l'll see him.
- Mr Novak.

1041
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,117
- Sit down, Mr Novak.
- Thank you, sir.

1042
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,076
Don't ''sir'' me, Mr Novak.

1043
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,036
l'm a sergeant.

1044
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,716
- l see you were in the navy.
- Yes, sir.

1045
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,752
l mean, yes, l was. ln the Seabees.

1046
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,836
Where'd you operate?

1047
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,599
All over the Pacific.
One island after another.

1048
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,870
What'd you do, mostly?

1049
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,232
Go in before the landings and clear
the mines and underwater obstructions.

1050
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,397
When they'd taken enough ground
for an airstrip we'd build it.

1051
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,876
- Fairly interesting work, eh?
- No, it got monotonous.

1052
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,391
Those islands all look alike.
Until lwo Jima. That was different.

1053
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,159
So l've heard.

1054
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,397
l see you have quite a family.
A wife and four children.

1055
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:34,672
Yes. There'd have been more
if l hadn't been away three years.

1056
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,758
- And now you wanna buy a farm.
- Yes, sir.

1057
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,189
Got my eye on a fine piece of property.

1058
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,675
40 acres, out near Anton Corners.

1059
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,756
What about collateral?

1060
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:49,794
- Collateral? What's that?
- Security for your loan.

1061
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,115
What can you put up
in the way of property?

1062
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:57,109
Have you any stocks and bonds?
Real estate? Valuables of any kind?

1063
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:01,233
No, Mr Stephenson. You see, the point is,
l haven't got any property.

1064
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,750
That's why l want the loan,
so l can get the property.

1065
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,030
l see.

1066
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:10,038
No collateral.
That makes things difficult.

1067
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:12,276
l'm a good farmer, Mr Stephenson.

1068
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,789
Why, even during the war
l kept my hand in.

1069
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:18,754
l used to spend my spare time down on
those islands working truck gardens

1070
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,793
so my outfit could have fresh tomatoes
and green corn and all that.

1071
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,516
And before the war l was a sharecropper,
like my father before me.

1072
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:32,156
And now, l feel l'd like to have
a little piece of my own to work.

1073
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,272
- You like to grow things, eh?
- Yes, sir.

1074
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,789
And with the food shortage
all over the world,

1075
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,912
farming's about the most
important work there is.

1076
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:45,192
l mean... Well, don't you think so,
Mr Stephenson?

1077
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,436
Yes.

1078
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:54,633
You see, Mr Stephenson, l don't feel
this is asking the bank for a handout.

1079
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:59,595
l feel it's my right. At least, that's what
l've been told by other ex-servicemen:

1080
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,109
that the government
guarantees loans to us...

1081
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,789
Your loan would be administered
through this bank,

1082
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,674
which would put up
half of the $6,000 you require.

1083
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,759
Now, that involves risk
for this bank, Mr Novak.

1084
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:20,876
Excuse me.

1085
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:32,799
- Al!
- Homer!

1086
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,639
- Look at you!
- Look at you!

1087
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:39,355
- So this is where you work.
- Sort of. Are you sticking up the bank?

1088
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:44,235
Look, 200 leaves of cabbage. That's
what l get every month from now on.

1089
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,430
- Pretty soft, eh?
- Pretty soft.

1090
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:51,714
- You sure we haven't short-changed you?
- l kept my eye on the guy counting it out.

1091
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,673
Did you know Fred Derry
had a job at the Midway Drugstore?

1092
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,268
- No, l didn't.
- He introduced me to his wife.

1093
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,550
- Yeah?
- (whistles) Some dish.

1094
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,478
We'll all have to get together at Butch's.

1095
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,909
- Fine. That's where l'm going now.
- Yeah?

1096
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,271
- To take a piano lesson.
- You... Uh-huh?

1097
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,595
Take one for me.

1098
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:13,359
- See you later.
- So long, Homer.

1099
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:25,994
Well, as l was saying, Mr Novak,
there is an element of risk involved.

1100
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:31,558
We'll have to have the property appraised.
But you'll get your loan.

1101
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,309
Say, Mr Stephenson,
l don't know how to begin to thank you.

1102
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,079
Don't try. You look like
a good risk to me.

1103
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:41,397
When the tomato plants start producing,
l want free samples.

1104
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,038
- l'll tell you when the papers are ready.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1105
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,116
God bless you.

1106
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,956
l've seen advertisements about this.

1107
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,753
Night of Bliss.
ls it all that they say it is?

1108
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,031
What do they say it is?
''Haunting, provocative, languorous.''

1109
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:06,151
Oh, yes, l'm sure it's all of those.

1110
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,276
Dexter!

1111
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,073
- Don't play with those toys, bud.
- My name ain't Bud!

1112
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,237
- Dexter, stop that.
- l just wanted to see how it worked.

1113
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,511
Sorry.
You heard what Mommy said.

1114
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:28,915
Ooh, Seduction. How much is that?

1115
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:34,478
This is... lt's quite expensive.
lt's 16.50. But it's a nice size.

1116
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,316
You see what l mean?

1117
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:46,989
- But it's a good, safe bet.
- Just what do you mean by that?

1118
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:50,271
Well, l mean it's...
it's a perfume that fits any mood.

1119
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,152
Oh!

1120
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:56,114
- All right, l'll take it.
- Very good, madam.

1121
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:59,277
Mommy! Mommy, look!
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

1122
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,551
l shot it down! l shot it down in flames!

1123
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,954
l'm very sorry... Oh, hello.

1124
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,036
Hello.

1125
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:19,073
Thank you very much.
l'll be with you in just a moment, madam.

1126
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,191
Will you take this, please?

1127
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,675
This lady will have your package
in a moment.

1128
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:27,588
- Thank you very much. Come in again.
- Thank you.

1129
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:30,834
- You were wonderful.
- l wanted to smack him.

1130
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,679
lt's against the rules to chat,
unless it's a sale.

1131
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,075
Oh. All right, l'll buy something.

1132
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,954
- What's this?
- Youth Recaptured, a complexion cream.

1133
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,958
But you don't need
any of that phoney stuff.

1134
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:46,311
That's vanishing cream.
This is a vanishing-cream remover.

1135
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:52,788
l'll tell you how you can save money. lf
you don't put that on, you don't need this.

1136
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:56,799
How about some lotion?
Here's one at $2.98.

1137
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,151
And you'd be overcharged
at half the price.

1138
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:02,396
l didn't really come in to buy anything.

1139
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,910
Dad told me you were working here.
l just dropped in to say hello.

1140
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:08,349
Just a minute. l have...

1141
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:14,431
l have an hour off at one o'clock.
Are you doing anything for lunch?

1142
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,233
- Why, no.
- Thank you, madam.

1143
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,477
l'll meet you outside in 20 minutes.
Come in again.

1144
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,113
Thank you.

1145
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,679
- The apple pie, she's homemade.
- Good.

1146
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,756
Thank you.

1147
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:46,548
lt is a nice little place.
l never heard of it before.

1148
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:50,639
l used to come here now and then
in the old days, before the war.

1149
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,593
l used to think of this place
when l was overseas.

1150
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:58,794
l thought ''When l get back home l'm
never gonna eat in a dump like Lucia's.''

1151
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:01,150
What else did you think you wouldn't do?

1152
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,670
l never had any clear ideas,
but there were two things l was sure of.

1153
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,509
One, that l knew l'd never
go back to that drugstore.

1154
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,676
What was the other thing?

1155
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,268
That was even sillier.

1156
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,675
l dreamed l was gonna have
my own home.

1157
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,349
Just a nice little house for my wife
and me out in the country...

1158
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,710
ln the suburbs, anyway.

1159
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,196
That's the cockeyed kind of dream
you have when you're overseas.

1160
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,790
You don't have to be overseas
to have dreams like that.

1161
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,879
Yeah. You can get crazy ideas
right here at home.

1162
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,952
- You have to be back at work at two?
- Yeah.

1163
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,471
Well, hadn't you better...?

1164
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:49,318
- Yeah. Check, please.
- 85c apiece for lunch, plus tax, is $1 .76.

1165
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,396
OK.

1166
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,557
- Thank you very much. Goodbye.
- Bye.

1167
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:59,116
- Goodbye, signorina. Come again.
- We'll do that. So long.

1168
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,434
Arrivederci.

1169
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,836
Well...

1170
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,996
That shouldn't have happened.

1171
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,996
But l guess it had to.

1172
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,834
- Goodbye, Peggy.
- Goodbye.

1173
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,998
We were discussing this loan
to this man... What's his name?

1174
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,031
Novak.

1175
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,469
Yes. Yes, l approved it.

1176
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:07,239
May l ask, Al, on what basis?

1177
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,909
On the basis of my own judgment.
Novak looked to me like a good bet.

1178
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,395
But the man has no collateral, no security.

1179
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,069
- Evidently, you saw something in him.
- Yes, Mr Milton.

1180
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,509
- What was it?
- Security.

1181
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,154
Collateral.

1182
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,273
ln the army l was with men stripped
of everything in the way of property

1183
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,949
except what they carried around
with them and inside them.

1184
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:33,390
l saw them being tested.
Some of them stood up to it, some didn't.

1185
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,080
But you could tell
which ones you could count on.

1186
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,078
l tell you, this man Novak is OK.

1187
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:45,230
His ''collateral'' is in his hands, in his
heart, in his guts. ln his right as a citizen.

1188
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,955
- Nobody's denying him his rights.
- We are. lf we deny him his chance...

1189
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,833
Gentlemen, there's no need
to raise our voices.

1190
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:56,511
Of course, since you've approved
the loan, the incident is closed.

1191
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:00,918
- However, in the future, Al...
- Yes, l understand, Mr Milton.

1192
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,271
ln the future l must exercise more caution.

1193
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,356
Thank you, Mr Prew.

1194
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,276
Al, uh...

1195
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:16,110
Al, you know how l feel
about you and always have.

1196
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:20,677
Why, l've always considered you
one of the family, so to speak.

1197
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,439
Like my own s... younger brother.

1198
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:28,234
l picked you personally for this job,
and l know you'll make good.

1199
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:36,233
We do have a desire to extend a helping
hand to returning veterans when possible.

1200
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:40,319
But we must all remember that
this is not our money we're doling out.

1201
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:45,116
lt belongs to our depositors,
and we can't gamble with it.

1202
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,435
l'll remember, Mr Milton.

1203
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,835
We'll meet at the Union Club at 7.30.

1204
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:55,114
- And give my best to your charming wife.
- Thank you, Mr Milton.

1205
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,196
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

1206
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,760
Hurry and get dressed.
And wear your new suit.

1207
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,189
We're going to dinner
at the Embassy Club.

1208
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,993
Don't worry, it won't cost
a nickel. We got invited.

1209
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,680
- Who invited us?
- Miss Peggy Stephenson.

1210
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:37,476
She called up, said her father was a friend
of yours. She sounded like a nice kid.

1211
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:42,037
She's going out with some boyfriend
and asked us on a double date, as guests.

1212
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:45,152
- You told her we could go?
- You bet l did.

1213
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:51,389
Well, call her up and tell her we can't go.
Tell her l made another engagement.

1214
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:56,550
- Say, who is this Peggy Stephenson?
- She's a girl.

1215
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:59,433
l didn't think she was a kangaroo.
Where'd you meet her?

1216
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:03,235
The night l got back, Al Stephenson
and his wife took me home.

1217
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,954
She's their daughter.
l'd never seen her before.

1218
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,877
Or since?

1219
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,231
lf you wanna make anything out of this,
you'll be disappointed.

1220
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,669
l just don't like accepting handouts.

1221
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:19,750
You'd better get used to it, cos we won't
get much fun on your 32.50 a week!

1222
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,756
Hold still!

1223
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,275
You'll probably have to make a speech.

1224
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:45,235
lt's my plan to meet that situation
by getting well plastered.

1225
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,158
- Peggy's going out with Woody Merrill.
- Who's he?

1226
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,635
- You know, Bill Merrill's son.
- Oh, yeah.

1227
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,558
Fine people, the Merrills.
Strictly TCR.

1228
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,558
- What's that?
- Top credit rating.

1229
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,399
- Are his intentions honourable?
- l doubt it.

1230
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:03,717
But they're going to be chaperoned
by Fred Derry and his wife.

1231
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:06,308
Fred Derry? Ha! Some chaperone!

1232
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:10,033
- l think she's crazy about him.
- Who, Merrill?

1233
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,390
No, Fred.

1234
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,478
Have you got evidence
to support that amazing statement?

1235
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,716
- Just a hunch.
- Oh.

1236
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:22,840
But my hunches are pretty good.

1237
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,189
- Ah! Cocktails!
- No, you don't.

1238
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,595
l made this for Woody Merrill.

1239
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:41,429
Surely you wouldn't deny your father
a drop on a cold night like this.

1240
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:45,553
- l would if l could.
- l hear you're gonna see Fred, hm?

1241
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:48,752
- Yes.
- What's his wife like?

1242
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,235
l don't know. l'll tell you later.

1243
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,954
They'll have cocktails at the Union Club.

1244
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:57,789
l know the kind Mrs Milton serves:
pink, sweet and nauseating.

1245
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,071
l was just asking Peggy about Fred's wife.

1246
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,510
Never mind, Mom.
l know what you're both thinking.

1247
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,714
What are we thinking?

1248
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,718
You're afraid l may be in love with Fred.

1249
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:14,310
- Why, l never had any such idea!
- Shut up, Al.

1250
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,908
Are you in love with him?

1251
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,917
Yes.

1252
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,190
But l don't want to be.

1253
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:26,518
That's why l asked him and his wife
to go out with us this evening.

1254
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:30,713
l think it ought to have
a very healthy effect on me.

1255
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,990
Once l get to know her, l...

1256
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,798
l'm sure l'll stop being silly
about the whole thing.

1257
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:45,589
We don't need to worry about that child.
She can take care of herself.

1258
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,676
That's what she thinks.

1259
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,918
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1260
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,678
- You know my father.
- Mr Stephenson.

1261
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,758
- Nice to see you again. Have a drink?
- Thank you.

1262
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,996
l've played golf with your father.

1263
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:01,192
- Been to the club since you got back?
- l haven't had a chance.

1264
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,833
- Al, we'll be late.
- Right.

1265
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,712
- Good night.
- Night.

1266
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,308
- Have a good time, children.
- Thank you.

1267
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,635
Give my best to Fred.

1268
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,911
Al, come on!

1269
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,916
Yes, Mr Milton!

1270
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:27,110
- Hello, Peggy.
- Oh, Woody, don't be a bore.

1271
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:29,997
We'll be late.

1272
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:33,271
Our country must stand today
where it has always stood,

1273
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:36,597
the citadel of individual initiative,

1274
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:40,269
the land of unlimited opportunity for all.

1275
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,436
lt is peculiarly appropriate

1276
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:52,509
that we meet here tonight to honour one
who has valiantly fought for that freedom.

1277
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:57,953
Ladies and gentlemen, we greet
our friend, our co-worker, our hero,

1278
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,638
Al Stephenson.

1279
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,910
Come on, on your feet, Al.
On your feet.

1280
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:12,914
Ladies and gentlemen,
l'm very happy to be here.

1281
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,474
ln fact, l'm very happy to be anywhere.

1282
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,556
ln fact, l'm very happy!

1283
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,959
Perhaps it'd be a good idea if you just
put that bottle down right here.

1284
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:28,471
- Save yourself quite a number of trips.
- Good old Al! (polite laugh)

1285
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,119
l'm glad to see
you've all pulled through so well.

1286
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:40,789
As Mr Milton so perfectly expressed it,

1287
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:46,870
our country stands today...
where it stands today. Wherever that is.

1288
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,869
l'm sure you'd all agree with me if l said
that now's the time to stop this nonsense,

1289
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:57,313
face facts, get down to brass tacks,
forget about the war, and go fishing.

1290
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,670
But l'm not gonna say it.

1291
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:03,349
l'm just going to sum the
whole thing up in one word.

1292
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:10,798
My wife doesn't think l'd better
sum it up in that one word.

1293
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,593
The reason for my success as a sergeant

1294
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:19,555
is due primarily to my previous training
in the Cornbelt Loan and Trust Company.

1295
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,715
The knowledge l acquired
in the good old bank

1296
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:26,355
l applied to my problems in the infantry.

1297
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:30,109
For instance, one day in Okinawa,
a major says ''You see that hill?''

1298
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:33,118
l said ''Yes, sir. l see it.''
''All right,'' he said.

1299
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:36,471
''You and your platoon will attack
said hill and take it.''

1300
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:41,390
So l said ''But that operation
involves considerable risk.''

1301
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,909
''We haven't sufficient collateral.''

1302
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:49,717
''l'm aware of that'', said the major, ''but
you are the guys who are going to take it.''

1303
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,595
So l said to him ''l'm sorry, Major.
No collateral, no hill.''

1304
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:59,838
So we didn't take the hill,
and we lost the war.

1305
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,835
Uh, l think that little story
has considerable significance.

1306
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:11,111
But l've... l've forgotten what it is.

1307
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:14,710
Uh...

1308
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:18,435
And now, in conclusion,
l'd like to tell you a humorous anecdote.

1309
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:23,395
l know several humorous anecdotes, but
l can't think of any way to clean 'em up!

1310
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,195
- (ripple of laughter)
- So l'll only say this much.

1311
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:30,118
l love the Cornbelt
Loan and Trust Company.

1312
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:37,076
Some say that the bank is suffering from
hardening of the arteries and of the heart.

1313
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:40,476
l refuse to listen to such radical talk.

1314
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:45,469
l say that our bank is alive,
it's generous, it's... it's human!

1315
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,353
And we're going to have
such a line of customers

1316
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:51,517
seeking and getting small loans

1317
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:55,076
that people will think we're gambling
with the depositors' money.

1318
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,634
And we will be!

1319
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:01,389
We'll be gambling on
the future of this country.

1320
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,712
l thank you.

1321
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:27,794
Woody, l can't take it any more.
Let's sit down.

1322
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,876
We can't get out. l'm trapped.

1323
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,389
How do you do? Ow!

1324
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,556
Beg your pardon!

1325
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:37,433
Well, anyway, we can't fall down.

1326
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:42,996
- ls that table satisfactory?
- Everything's lovely.

1327
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,436
Thank you very much.
Would you care to order now?

1328
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,152
Sorry.

1329
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:04,188
- l can't understand it.
- What?

1330
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:08,199
Why you're not mad about me.
l think l'm attractive.

1331
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,470
You are, Woody. You're irresistible.

1332
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,795
Then why do you go on resisting me?

1333
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:15,514
All marriages don't have
to be like that one.

1334
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:19,315
- Which one?
- Your friends, Fred and Marie.

1335
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:24,036
- What's wrong with their marriage?
- Nothing, except one slight detail.

1336
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:26,799
They just don't like each other.

1337
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:33,194
lt's murder on the dance floor. lt's awful!

1338
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:37,108
- You don't wanna dance any more?
- Love to! You don't mind if l borrow him?

1339
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,356
No, not at all.

1340
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:48,874
- Why did you do this, Peggy?
- Do what? What do you mean?

1341
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,993
Calling up Marie
and going out like this. Together.

1342
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:55,793
- l did it deliberately.
- Why?

1343
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:03,875
To prove to myself that what happened
this afternoon didn't really happen.

1344
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,796
But it did happen.

1345
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,956
lt had to happen.

1346
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:15,789
And if we go on seeing each other, Peggy,
it'll happen again.

1347
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,596
Be-bop a-ree-bop

1348
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,995
Be-bop...

1349
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:33,076
Excuse us.

1350
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:38,155
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1351
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,474
We want to have a picture taken
in a few minutes.

1352
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,397
Fine. l'll be here.

1353
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,476
Excuse me.

1354
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,000
- Hello, Marie.
- Good evening.

1355
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:00,318
- You got to watch yourself. More wolves!
- l know.

1356
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:03,796
l'd pay no attention to the sign.
Go right in!

1357
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:11,029
- Gee, Woody's a cute boy.
- He's a lot of fun.

1358
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:13,799
He's got dough, too.
His family own half the city.

1359
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,876
He has a terrific yen for you.

1360
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,632
l don't want to butt into your affairs, but
if you take my advice, you'll grab Woody!

1361
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,513
Woody and l are good friends,
but there's no romance.

1362
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:29,794
Never mind the romantic part. That takes
care of itself. l speak from experience.

1363
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:34,835
They'll tell you money isn't everything.
Maybe it isn't but, boy, how it helps!

1364
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,316
While Fred was away
l was drawing over $500 a month.

1365
01:54:38,440 --> 01:54:40,795
l mean, from his army pay
and the job l had.

1366
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:46,950
Now the two of us gotta live on what Fred
gets from the drugstore. 32.50 a week!

1367
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,438
Poor Fred. Bet you think he's a sourpuss.
He didn't used to be that way, though.

1368
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:58,076
Army's had an awful effect on him.
Knocked all the life out of him!

1369
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:01,670
Fred isn't going to be satisfied
with that job at the drugstore.

1370
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:07,272
- He'll get something better.
- Maybe in five years he'll draw 50 bucks.

1371
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:11,757
You can't have happy marriages
on that kind of dough.

1372
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:18,876
You know, Peggy, you're cute.
But you could use a little more make-up.

1373
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,913
And get yourself a better hairdo.
l'll give you the name of my hairdresser.

1374
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:25,395
Oh, but you've got nothing to worry about.

1375
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:30,548
You'll get Woody and live
happily ever after. lt's in the bag!

1376
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,836
Thank you.

1377
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:45,152
Now, everybody get in close together,
put our arms around each other.

1378
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,669
Come on, Fred. l don't mind.

1379
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:53,308
Ooh! Wait, l'll tell you when.
Everybody, happy. Let's all be talking.

1380
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:56,193
What a marvellous party.
We'll have to do this again.

1381
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,276
OK, shoot the picture!

1382
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,070
We want four copies, honey.

1383
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,951
Mr Milton certainly acted enthusiastic
about your speech.

1384
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:10,958
Yeah, sure. That's how
he acted, the old hypocrite.

1385
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:15,756
- Suppose he'll fire you in the morning?
- No, he'll never do anything impetuous.

1386
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:19,759
He'll back me up, till the next time
l give a loan to some little guy.

1387
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:22,792
- Then l'll have to fight it out again.
- (knock at door)

1388
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:25,354
- Yes?
- lt's me, Peggy.

1389
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:27,436
Oh, come in, darling.

1390
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,349
- Did you have a good time?
- Not very.

1391
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,914
Ah, what's all this? Children's Hour?

1392
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,395
l beg your pardon.

1393
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,076
Well? What's she like?

1394
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:52,792
l'm glad l went out with them.

1395
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,593
Even though it was
a disagreeable experience.

1396
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:59,269
lt took guts, honey.
But you got plenty.

1397
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:02,472
l'll need them.
l've made up my mind.

1398
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,795
- Good girl.
- To do what?

1399
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,154
l'm going to break that marriage up.

1400
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:15,310
l can't stand seeing Fred tied
to a woman he doesn't love.

1401
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,795
And who doesn't love him.

1402
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:22,710
lt's horrible for him. lt's humiliating,
and it's killing his spirit.

1403
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,796
Somebody's got to help him.

1404
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:28,754
- Are you sure he doesn't love her?
- Of course l am.

1405
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,836
Did he tell you?

1406
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,789
- Did she?
- No.

1407
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,956
So you just jumped to conclusions!

1408
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:40,789
He doesn't love her, he hates her.
l know it.

1409
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:43,753
- l know it.
- Who are you, God?!

1410
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:46,792
How did you get this power
to interfere in people's lives?

1411
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,876
ls Fred in love with you?

1412
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,998
Yes.

1413
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:56,636
- You've been seeing him?
- Only once. Today.

1414
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:59,320
Oh, it was all perfectly respectable.

1415
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:02,477
But when we were saying goodbye, he...

1416
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:05,637
he took me in his arms
and kissed me and...

1417
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:08,437
and l knew.

1418
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:13,793
You think a kiss from a smooth operator
like Fred means anything?!

1419
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:18,710
You don't know him. You don't know
anything about what's inside him.

1420
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:21,673
Neither does she. His wife.

1421
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:24,553
That's probably what she thought -

1422
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:27,478
a smooth operator
with money in his pockets.

1423
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:30,910
But now he isn't smooth any longer,
and she's lost interest.

1424
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:34,271
Whereas you're possessed
of all the wisdom of the ages

1425
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:37,710
You can see into the secret recesses
of his innermost soul

1426
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:40,070
l can see because l love him.

1427
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:44,835
So you're gonna break this marriage up.
Have you decided how?

1428
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:46,916
Are you gonna do it with an axe?

1429
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,838
lt's none of your business
how l'm going to do it!

1430
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:53,157
You've forgotten
what it's like to be in love!

1431
01:58:54,200 --> 01:59:00,833
Hear that? l'm so old and decrepit, l've
forgotten how it feels to want somebody.

1432
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:05,316
Peggy didn't mean that.
Did you, darling?

1433
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:08,389
No.

1434
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:12,514
l don't know what l do mean.

1435
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:17,191
lt's just that everything has
always been so perfect for you.

1436
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:20,437
You loved each other
and you got married in a big church

1437
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,233
and you had a honeymoon
in the South of France.

1438
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:26,193
You never had any trouble of any kind.

1439
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:30,029
So how can you possibly understand
how it is with Fred and me?

1440
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,996
We never had any trouble?

1441
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,556
How many times have l told you
l hated you and believed it in my heart?

1442
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,835
How many times have you said you were
sick of me, that we were all washed up?

1443
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:52,757
How many times have we had to
fall in love all over again?

1444
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,356
l'm sorry, Mom.

1445
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:16,199
Never mind about that, darling.

1446
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:45,037
- Fred.
- Hiya, Butch.

1447
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:46,593
- Hello, Fred.
- Al here?

1448
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:50,872
- He's back there, waiting for you.
- See you later.

1449
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:56,638
- Hiya, Al.
- Sit down, Fred.

1450
02:00:56,760 --> 02:01:00,355
- What are you drinking?
- A cup of coffee. Gotta have a clear head.

1451
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:03,517
- A cup of coffee and a bourbon and soda.
- Yes, sir.

1452
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:08,475
What's on your mind, Al? Want to
borrow some money or something?

1453
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:11,751
l, uh... called you to ask you a question.

1454
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,756
OK. Shoot.

1455
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,913
Are you in love with Peggy?

1456
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:26,235
- ls there a law compelling me to answer?
- No.

1457
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:30,592
Nevertheless, l repeat:
are you in love with Peggy?

1458
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,388
Yes.

1459
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:39,713
l thank you for a short and honest answer.

1460
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,515
You're welcome.
Now what do we take up next?

1461
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:46,108
Your wife. What about her?

1462
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:50,396
Where does she fit
in this romantic situation?

1463
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:53,273
ls that any of your business?

1464
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:56,312
That's what Peggy said -
that it's none of my business.

1465
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,431
Oh, you've had her on the carpet, too.

1466
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:02,235
She volunteered some information
to her mother and me.

1467
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:06,353
You see, we have a rather unusual
relationship in our family.

1468
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:11,600
lt may seem corny and mid-Victorian,
but we tell each other things.

1469
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:13,870
l happen to be quite fond of Peggy, and l...

1470
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,116
You don't want her mixed up with a heel.

1471
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:18,595
l haven't called you a heel. Yet.

1472
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:23,394
l just don't want to see her
get into this mess.

1473
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:35,079
OK, chum, what do we do now?

1474
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,794
Step out and settle this thing in the alley?

1475
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,480
l wouldn't want to recommend
that as a solution.

1476
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:42,909
l've learned to fight dirty.

1477
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:46,510
lf l got tangled up with you,
l might break your neck.

1478
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:48,471
l wouldn't like that.

1479
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:52,752
- You see, l'm quite fond of you, too.
- Thanks.

1480
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:56,919
But l don't like the idea of you
sneaking around corners to see Peggy,

1481
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:00,112
taking her love on a bootleg basis.

1482
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:04,233
l give you fair warning, l'll do everything
l can to keep her away from you,

1483
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:09,150
to help her forget about you and get her
married to a guy who'll make her happy.

1484
02:03:22,840 --> 02:03:24,990
Then l guess that's it, Al.

1485
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:27,429
l don't see her any more.

1486
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:30,438
l'll put that in the form of a guarantee.

1487
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,028
l won't see her any more.

1488
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:35,310
l'll call her up and tell her so.

1489
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,590
- That satisfy you?
- Yeah.

1490
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:41,839
- Anything else on your mind?
- No.

1491
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:45,156
OK, chum. So long.

1492
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:48,116
So long, Fred.

1493
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:52,758
The drinks are on me.

1494
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:16,071
- Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Steve.

1495
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:18,191
Say, Al Stephenson's back there.

1496
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:20,276
- Al?
- Yeah.

1497
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:22,673
- Hi, Al.
- Hello, Homer.

1498
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,756
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

1499
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:26,996
- Hello, Homer.
- Hi, Butch.

1500
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:29,395
- Say, let's show Al that new routine.
- Sure.

1501
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:33,149
Got something to show you, Al.
Well, come on.

1502
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:37,994
- Boy, wait till you hear this.
- All set, kid?

1503
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:40,918
- l'm ready when you are.
- OK. One, two, three.

1504
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:42,996
(  ''Chopsticks'')

1505
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:30,273
That's fine!

1506
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,868
What's the matter?
Didn't you like it, Al?

1507
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,788
Sure, it was swell. l thought you were
kidding about the piano lessons.

1508
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:38,876
Fred! Hey, Fred!

1509
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:43,150
That was Fred.

1510
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:44,759
Yeah.

1511
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:48,190
- ls anything wrong?
- No, he had to go back to the drugstore.

1512
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,754
Come on, Homer, buy me a drink.

1513
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:08,314
Who was it?

1514
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:10,396
Fred.

1515
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:21,395
He said he's sorry for what happened,
but it was just one of those things.

1516
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:27,310
He said it wouldn't be fair to his wife for
us to see each other any more because...

1517
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:33,037
l'm obviously the kind of girl
that takes these things too seriously.

1518
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:37,199
Then he said goodbye,
very politely, and hung up.

1519
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:45,237
Well, l guess you and Dad
won't have to worry about me any more.

1520
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:50,034
That's the end of my career
as a home-wrecker.

1521
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:05,591
Mom, l know you feel sorry for me.
You think my poor little heart is broken.

1522
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:10,350
But you can save your sympathy.
l can see things clearer now.

1523
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,709
l made a fool of myself.

1524
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,469
l'm getting some sense
hammered into me now.

1525
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:20,353
l'm glad l'm out of that mess.

1526
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:23,631
l'm glad l'll never see him again! l...

1527
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:30,313
Two chocolate sundaes coming up.

1528
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,960
What about a ham and cheese
on whole-wheat?

1529
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:41,310
Ham and cheese coming up.

1530
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:07,192
Here you are.

1531
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:08,958
Thank you.

1532
02:08:10,640 --> 02:08:13,359
- Hello, Homer. How've you been?
- Hi, Fred.

1533
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:16,040
- Glad to see you.
- Say, Fred.

1534
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:18,720
- Yeah?
- What happened at Butch's?

1535
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:22,628
- What do you mean?
- You and Al. Was there any trouble?

1536
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:26,719
Oh, no. We were just having
a little friendly chat.

1537
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:29,193
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks.

1538
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:32,756
- What'll yours be, Homer?
- Oh, l don't care. A chocolate sundae.

1539
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,836
OK.

1540
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:37,594
Hi.

1541
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:39,915
- How are you, soldier?
- Sailor.

1542
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:41,996
Excuse me.

1543
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:47,838
Say, uh... do you mind if
l ask you a personal question?

1544
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:51,270
l know what it is. How did l get
these hooks, and how do they work?

1545
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:55,518
That's what everybody says when they
start off ''Mind if l ask you a question?''

1546
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:59,474
Well, l'll tell you. l got sick and tired
of that old pair of hands l had.

1547
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:03,115
An awful lot of trouble,
washing them and manicuring my nails.

1548
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:05,708
So l traded them in
for these latest models.

1549
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:08,115
They work by radar. Look.

1550
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:21,796
- Pretty cute, eh?
- You got plenty of guts.

1551
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:27,431
lt's terrible when you see a guy like you
that had to sacrifice himself. For what?

1552
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:31,873
- For what?! l don't get you, mister.
- Well...

1553
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,355
- Anything else for you?
- Check.

1554
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:38,870
We let ourselves get sold down the river.
We were pushed into war.

1555
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,956
Sure, by the Japs and the Nazis.

1556
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:43,594
The Germans and the Japs
had nothing against us.

1557
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:45,836
They wanted to fight
the limeys and the Reds.

1558
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:51,910
They would've whipped 'em, too, if we
didn't get deceived into it by Washington.

1559
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:54,554
What are you talking about?

1560
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:57,399
We fought the wrong people, that's all.

1561
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:01,877
Just read the facts, my friend. Find out for
yourself why you had to lose your hands.

1562
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,630
- Then go out and do something about it.
- You'd better pay your check and go.

1563
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:10,469
- Well, who do you think you are?
- Pay the cashier right over there.

1564
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:12,352
- Coffee, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

1565
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:19,431
There's another thing. Every soda jerk in
this country's got an idea he's somebody!

1566
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:28,156
What are you selling anyway?

1567
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:31,636
l'm not selling anything
but plain old-fashioned Americanism.

1568
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:34,957
Some Americanism!
So we're all a bunch of suckers?

1569
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,799
So we should've been on the side
of the Japs and the Nazis?

1570
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:41,356
Again l say, just look at the facts.

1571
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:45,951
l've seen facts. l've seen a ship go down,
and 400 of my shipmates went with it.

1572
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:48,036
Were those guys suckers?!

1573
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:52,199
That's the unpleasant truth,
and the sooner we get wise to it...

1574
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:56,279
- Ooh, if l only had my hands!
- You put those down!

1575
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:00,634
Take your hands off him!

1576
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:12,758
May l get through, please?

1577
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,791
- Go get the druggist.
- Yes, sir.

1578
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:17,150
Make way, please.
What happened?

1579
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:20,955
- lt was Fred Derry. He hit him.
- Bring some iodine and bandages.

1580
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:23,514
- Yes, sir.
- Don't say it, chum.

1581
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:27,792
The customer's always right, so l'm fired.
But this customer wasn't right.

1582
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:31,071
l'll meet you outside in a minute, kid.

1583
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:10,118
Gee, Fred, l'm sorry l lost you your job.
But that guy...

1584
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:16,475
Yeah, l know. You read about guys like
that, but you don't often see 'em, luckily.

1585
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:18,556
How about your girlfriend - Wilma?

1586
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:22,070
- You and she gonna get married?
- l don't know.

1587
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:25,112
Why don't you know?
Doesn't she want to get married?

1588
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:28,118
lt isn't Wilma's fault.
She's been swell about it.

1589
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:33,234
- So then it's your fault?
- Yeah, l... l guess it is.

1590
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:37,752
- Will you do me a favour, Homer?
- Sure, Fred. What is it?

1591
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:42,078
l'm a hot one to be giving advice
to the lovelorn, but go see Wilma - now.

1592
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:46,159
Take her in your arms, kiss her,
ask her to marry you, then marry her.

1593
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:48,430
Tomorrow, if you can get a licence.

1594
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:53,076
lf you want anybody to stand up for you at
your wedding... There's my bus. So long.

1595
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:55,156
So long, Fred.

1596
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:41,913
- You all right?
- l'm just going to get a glass of milk.

1597
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:44,110
Just knock on the door
when you want me.

1598
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:46,196
OK.

1599
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:18,595
Wilma! What are you doing out this hour?

1600
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:22,599
l saw you were up, Homer.
l saw you through the window.

1601
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:24,676
l've got to talk to you.

1602
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,756
All right, come in.

1603
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:36,830
- Want some chicken?
- No, thanks.

1604
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,996
- Sure?
- Yes.

1605
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:43,074
- Want a glass of milk?
- No, thanks, Homer.

1606
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:45,760
Sit down, Wilma.

1607
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:50,396
Homer, l... My family want me
to go away, tomorrow.

1608
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:56,319
- Where?
- Up to Silver Lake. My Aunt Vera's place.

1609
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:02,111
That ought to be nice.

1610
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:04,435
But l don't want to go.

1611
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,516
l want to stay here.

1612
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:12,433
You see, the reason they want me to go
is so that l'll forget about you.

1613
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:16,030
They figure you don't want me around,
you don't want to see me,

1614
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:20,551
and if l go away for a while,
maybe l'll get all this out of my mind.

1615
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:23,069
Maybe that's a good idea, Wilma.

1616
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:26,112
Maybe you ought to do that.

1617
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:28,390
Do you want to get rid of me?

1618
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:35,035
Tell me the truth, Homer.
Do you want me to forget about you?

1619
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:42,910
l want you to be free, Wilma.

1620
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,793
To live your own life.

1621
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:50,869
l don't want you tied down forever
just because you've got a kind heart.

1622
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:56,552
Homer, why can't you understand the way
things really are? The way l really feel?

1623
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:58,716
l keep trying to tell you.

1624
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,753
But... but you don't know, Wilma.

1625
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,709
You don't know what it'd be like
to have to live with me,

1626
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:14,119
to have to... face this
every day, every night.

1627
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:16,629
But l can only find out by trying.

1628
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:21,709
lf it turns out l haven't courage enough,
we'll soon know it.

1629
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:34,878
Wilma, you and l have been close
to each other for a long time, haven't we?

1630
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,956
Ever since we were kids.

1631
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:41,556
Yes, Homer.

1632
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:47,470
l'm going upstairs to bed.

1633
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:55,277
l want you to... l want you to come up
and see for yourself what happens.

1634
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:01,036
All right, Homer.

1635
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:53,396
l've learned how to take this harness off.

1636
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:04,280
l can wiggle into my pyjama top.

1637
02:19:12,480 --> 02:19:16,189
l'm lucky, l have my elbows.
Some of the boys don't.

1638
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:20,279
- But l can't button 'em up.
- l'll do that, Homer.

1639
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:44,791
This is when l know l'm helpless.

1640
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:47,195
My hands are down there on the bed.

1641
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:50,835
l can't put them on again
without calling to somebody for help.

1642
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:53,872
l can't smoke a cigarette or read a book.

1643
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,630
lf that door should blow shut,
l can't open it and get out of this room.

1644
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:05,029
As dependent as a baby that doesn't know
how to get anything except cry for it.

1645
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:08,719
Well, now you know, Wilma.

1646
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:11,229
Now you have an idea of what it is.

1647
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:13,555
l guess you don't know what to say.

1648
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:18,800
lt's all right. Go on home.
Go away, like your family said.

1649
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:22,270
l know what to say, Homer.

1650
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:26,279
l love you.
And l'm never going to leave you.

1651
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:28,356
Never.

1652
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:01,994
You mean, you... you didn't mind?

1653
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:05,476
Of course not.
l told you l loved you.

1654
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:12,957
l love you, Wilma.

1655
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:16,311
l always have, and... and l always will.

1656
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:54,993
Good night, darling. Sleep well.

1657
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:06,116
Good night, Wilma.

1658
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:05,955
Hey, sugar. You'd better step on it,
or your husband'll be home.

1659
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:09,311
He's job-hunting.
He won't come home for another hour.

1660
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:11,954
- And what if he does?
- l don't understand it.

1661
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:15,595
All this money around and he can't
get into it. What's wrong with him?

1662
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:19,315
l guess he just isn't very bright.

1663
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:26,429
How do you do?

1664
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:28,516
Fine, thanks. Who are you?

1665
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:31,837
Fred, l want you to meet Cliff Scully,
an old friend of mine.

1666
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:34,918
- Hiya, Freddy.
- Glad to know you, Scully. Get out.

1667
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,554
- A tough guy, huh?
- Now listen, Fred.

1668
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:41,275
You won't get anywhere with
that attitude. Cliff's an old friend.

1669
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:44,119
He's asked me out, and l'm going out.

1670
02:23:44,240 --> 02:23:47,550
- You heard me, chum. Get out.
- What do l do next? Smack him?

1671
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:50,240
Why ask her?
Can't you think for yourself?

1672
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:52,954
Go on. l can handle this.
Wait for me downstairs.

1673
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:55,036
OK.

1674
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:06,276
Another ex-serviceman, huh?

1675
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:09,676
Greetings. Have you had
any trouble getting readjusted?

1676
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:13,793
Not in particular. lt's easy if you
just take everything in your stride.

1677
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:16,639
That's what l've heard.

1678
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:21,830
- Be seeing you.
- l doubt it.

1679
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:26,398
- When did you pick him up?
- He's an old friend.

1680
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:29,751
He just dropped in for a friendly drink.

1681
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:34,352
- Did you know him while l was away?
- l knew lots of people.

1682
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:38,268
- What do you think l did all those years?
- l don't know, but l can guess.

1683
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:41,392
Go ahead, guess.
l could do some guessing myself.

1684
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:45,035
What were you up to in London
and Paris and all those places?

1685
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:49,870
l've given you every chance to make
something of yourself. l gave up my job.

1686
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:53,913
l gave up the best years of my life!
And what have you done? You've flopped.

1687
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:56,235
Couldn't even hold a job at the drugstore.

1688
02:24:56,360 --> 02:25:00,239
So l'm going back to work for myself.
And l'm going to live for myself, too.

1689
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:04,114
And in case you don't understand English,
l'm gonna get a divorce.

1690
02:25:04,240 --> 02:25:06,800
What have you got to say to that?

1691
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:13,393
Don't keep Cliff waiting.

1692
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:17,674
- What are you gonna do?
- l'm going away.

1693
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:21,759
- Where?
- As far away from Boone City as l can get.

1694
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:26,078
That's a good idea.
You'll get a good job someplace else.

1695
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:29,033
There are drugstores everywhere.

1696
02:26:03,880 --> 02:26:06,553
Here's an old sweater
l found. Remember?

1697
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:08,636
- Sure.
- You might need it sometime.

1698
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:11,832
- Thanks, Hortense.
- You forgot these, son.

1699
02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:15,111
- Oh, l don't want 'em, Pop.
- What are they?

1700
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:18,437
Fancy words that don't mean anything.
You can throw 'em away.

1701
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:22,030
Say, these are citations for your medals.

1702
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:24,310
Why, Freddy,
you never showed them to us.

1703
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:27,113
Those things came in
the packages with K rations.

1704
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,913
Well, we'll treasure them, my boy.

1705
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:32,873
l'll get the socks l washed for you.

1706
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:36,916
Think you're doing the right thing, son?

1707
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:41,909
Going? Who's to say in advance whether
it's the right thing or the wrong thing?

1708
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:44,554
lt just means a fresh start
in some other place.

1709
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:47,433
How do you know
it'll be different anyplace else?

1710
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:52,190
There's a need here for fellas like yourself
that fought and won the war.

1711
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:56,711
l know you haven't had the best of breaks
since you got back, but...

1712
02:26:56,840 --> 02:27:03,075
you ought to stick here and slug it out
a while longer on your own home ground.

1713
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:06,396
You're all right, Pop.

1714
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:09,557
But l know when it's time to bail out.

1715
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,636
l gotta get going.

1716
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:20,432
- Here are your clean socks, Fred.
- Just put 'em in here.

1717
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:23,518
- Take good care of the old man.
- l'll do my best.

1718
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:27,838
- But we'll miss you, Freddy.
- You ought to be used to that by now.

1719
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:29,916
So long, Pop.

1720
02:27:57,040 --> 02:28:01,238
We've got two flights going out of here
tonight. One eastbound, one westbound.

1721
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:04,272
You'll have to ask the pilot.
Which way you going?

1722
02:28:04,400 --> 02:28:06,356
Which one leaves first?

1723
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:09,431
Eastbound. Eight o'clock.

1724
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:13,075
That'll be fine. l'll just
hang around the field until then.

1725
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:15,350
You don't seem to care
where you're going.

1726
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,835
That's right, chum. l don't.

1727
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:32,676
Hortense.

1728
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:34,712
Hortense!

1729
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:37,638
Listen to this. Sit down.

1730
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:42,595
''Headquarters, 8th Air Force.
Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross.''

1731
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:44,676
Um... Here.

1732
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:49,156
''Despite intense pain,
shock and loss of blood,

1733
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:52,192
with complete disregard
of his personal safety,

1734
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:54,834
Captain Derry crawled
back to his bombsight,

1735
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:58,111
guided his formation
on a perfect run over the objective

1736
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:01,232
and released his bombs
with great accuracy.''

1737
02:29:01,360 --> 02:29:06,673
''The heroism, devotion to duty,
professional skill and coolness under fire

1738
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:10,156
displayed by Captain Derry,

1739
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,716
under the most difficult conditions,

1740
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:20,279
reflect highest credit on himself and
the Armed Forces of the United States.''

1741
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:25,719
''By command of
Lieutenant General Doolittle.''

1742
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:28,989
Hey, bud,
what are you doing up there?

1743
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:32,396
Hey, you!

1744
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:36,232
What are you doing in that airplane?

1745
02:32:56,360 --> 02:33:00,751
- l used to work in one of those.
- Reviving old memories, huh?

1746
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:03,348
Or maybe getting some of 'em
out of my system.

1747
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:06,313
Well, take your last look.
We're breaking 'em up.

1748
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:10,194
Yeah, l know. You're the junkman.
You get everything sooner or later.

1749
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:15,872
This is no junk. We're using this material
for building prefabricated houses.

1750
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,036
You don't need any help, do you?

1751
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:20,230
- Out of a job?
- That's it.

1752
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:23,511
l see. One of the fallen angels
of the air force.

1753
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:25,915
Well, pardon me if l show no sympathy.

1754
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:30,079
While you glamour boys were up in the
wild blue yonder, l was down in a tank.

1755
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:33,590
Sometime l'll be glad to hear
the story of your war experiences.

1756
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:37,508
What l asked you for was a job.
Have you got one?

1757
02:33:37,640 --> 02:33:41,713
- Do you know anything about building?
- No. But l know how to learn.

1758
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:44,513
Same as l learned that job up there.

1759
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:48,951
- Hey, Gus.
- Yes?

1760
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:51,514
See if you think this guy
can be of any use to us.

1761
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:53,596
Thanks.

1762
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:06,200
Now, children, let's remember the words.

1763
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:10,438
The bride will come down those stairs.
When l see her l'll hit the first note,

1764
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:13,393
then l'll nod my head
and then we'll sing, huh?

1765
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:15,476
All right, let's try it.

1766
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:18,039
- Here she comes.
-   Here...

1767
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,991
Wait for the note.

1768
02:34:20,120 --> 02:34:22,236
Here's comes the bri...

1769
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:23,998
That's fine.

1770
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:32,790
- Mrs Cameron?
- Yes. Mrs Stephenson?

1771
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:34,797
- Yes.
- Come right in, won't you?

1772
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:36,512
- My daughter.
- How do you do?

1773
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:38,835
- How do you do, Mrs Cameron?
- How do you do?

1774
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:40,996
- There you go.
- You shouldn't have.

1775
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:42,838
- My daughter.
- Miss Stephenson.

1776
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:44,996
- Hello.

Steady, boy!

1785
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:14,915
l heard you were leaving town. l was
afraid you wouldn't stand up for me.

1786
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:17,190
l'll stand up for you, kid, till l drop.

1787
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:20,232
Oh, Fred, here's the ring.

1788
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:22,316
Don't lose it.

1789
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:26,397
- Hiya, Homer. Big day, huh?
- Hi, Al.

1790
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:29,318

1791
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:32,910
l, uh... l hear you moved back
with your folks.

1792
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:35,349
Yeah.

1793
02:35:35,480 --> 02:35:38,711
l've sampled the punch.
l presume it was made for the kiddies.

1794
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:42,958
- Will you have some, Homer?
- l might give the wrong answers.

1795
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:46,470
- How about you, Fred?
- No, thanks. Maybe later.

1796
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:49,592
Well, if l must be a solitary drinker,
good luck, kid.

1797
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:52,598
- Thank you, Al.
- Al! You promised you wouldn't.

1798
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:55,712
- Take a sip of this.
- Hello, Fred. Homer.

1799
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:59,628
- There isn't a headache in a barrel of it.
- Al can take it.

1800
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:01,716
- He certainly can.
- Excuse me.

1801
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:03,796
See for yourself.

1802
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:39,235
Hello, Fred. Nice to see you again.

1803
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:42,158
Hello, Peggy. Nice to see you.

1804
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:46,916
Well, what have you been doing
with yourself lately?

1805
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:49,110
Working.

1806
02:36:50,960 --> 02:36:55,511
Yes... Dad told me he heard
you were in some kind of building work.

1807
02:36:56,880 --> 02:36:59,235
Well, it's a hopeful way of putting it.

1808
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:01,635
l'm really in the junk business.

1809
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:05,548
An occupation for which many people
feel l'm well qualified,

1810
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:07,830
by temperament and training.

1811
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:09,916
lt's fascinating work.

1812
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:14,476
- Where's Homer? Wilma's ready.
- l'll get him.

1813
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:16,556
Excuse me.

1814
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:21,717
Mary, Kay, go ahead.
Jackie. Jackie!

1815
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:25,196
Over here.

1816
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:42,913
Watch me.

1817
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:46,749
Here comes the bride

1818
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:50,998
All dressed in white

1819
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:59,277
Sweetly serene
in the soft, glowing light

1820
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:03,552
Lovely to see

1821
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:07,389
Marching to thee

1822
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:11,672
Sweet love united

1823
02:38:11,800 --> 02:38:17,113
For eternity

1824
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:25,030
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in the sight of God and this company

1825
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:29,278
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1826
02:38:29,400 --> 02:38:33,632
lf any man can show just cause why
they may not lawfully be joined together,

1827
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:38,436
let him now speak, or else hereafter
forever hold his peace.

1828
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,639
Homer, wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife?

1829
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:43,034
l will.

1830
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:46,118
Wilma, wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband?

1831
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:47,639
l will.

1832
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:50,149
Who gives this woman
to be married to this man?

1833
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:52,077
l do.

1834
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:58,150
Now, Homer, will you take Wilma's
right hand in yours and say after me:

1835
02:38:58,280 --> 02:39:00,874
l, Homer, take thee, Wilma,
to my wedded wife.

1836
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:03,873
l, Homer, take thee, Wilma,
to my wedded wife.

1837
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,309
To have and to hold from this day forward.

1838
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:09,029
To have and to hold from this day forward.

1839
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:12,072
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

1840
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:15,233
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

1841
02:39:15,360 --> 02:39:19,433
ln sickness and in health. To love
and to cherish till death us do part.

1842
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:25,995
ln sickness and in health. To love
and to cherish till death do... us do part.

1843
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:31,717
Now, Wilma, with your right hand, take
Homer by his right hand and say after me:

1844
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:36,599
l, Wilma, take thee, Homer,
to my wedded husband.

1845
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:39,673
l, Wilma, take thee, Homer,
to my wedded husband.

1846
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:42,030
To have and to hold from this day forward.

1847
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:44,999
To have and to hold from this day forward.

1848
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:48,078
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

1849
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:51,119
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

1850
02:39:51,240 --> 02:39:55,870
ln sickness and in health. To love
and to cherish till death us do part.

1851
02:39:56,400 --> 02:40:02,191
ln sickness and in health. To love
and to cherish till death us do part.

1852
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:04,276
The ring.

1853
02:40:09,720 --> 02:40:13,872
Place it on the fourth finger
of Wilma's left hand.

1854
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:37,155
Repeat after me:

1855
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:39,111
With this ring, l thee wed.

1856
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:41,590
With this ring, l thee wed.

1857
02:40:48,320 --> 02:40:52,757
Those whom God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.

1858
02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:56,714
For as much as Homer and Wilma
have consented together in holy wedlock

1859
02:40:56,840 --> 02:40:59,877
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company,

1860
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:03,834
and thereto have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other,

1861
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:08,829
and have declared the same by giving and
receiving a ring, and by joining hands,

1862
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:12,111
l pronounce that they are man and wife.

1863
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:14,196
God bless you both.

1864
02:41:48,440 --> 02:41:50,829
You know what it'll be, don't you, Peggy?

1865
02:41:50,960 --> 02:41:53,679
lt may take us years to get anywhere.

1866
02:41:53,800 --> 02:41:57,190
We'll have no money,
no decent place to live.

1867
02:41:57,320 --> 02:42:00,676
We'll have to work, get kicked around...
