as the other.

It's Muley Graves. You remember

They gone to your UncleJohn's...

'causeJohn's got his notice to get off.

Well, what happened?
How come they got to get off?

143

We lived here 50 years,

- Listen. That's some of what done it.
- [Wind Howling]

150

The dusters.
They started it, anyways.

can handle 12 or 14 of these places.

165
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,000
You just pay him a wage
and take all the crop.

166
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,300
Yeah, but we couldn't do on any less
than what our share is now.

167
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, the children ain't gettin'
enough to eat as it is.

168
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
And they're so ragged...
[Scoffs]

169
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,700
We'd be ashamed if everybody
else's children wasn't the same way.

170
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,100
I can't help that.
All I know is I got my orders.

171
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,700
They told me to tell you
to get off, and that's what I'm tellin' ya.

172
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
You mean get off
my own land?

173

Now, don't go to blamin' me.
It ain't my fault.

174
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,400
- Whose fault is it?
- You know who owns the land...

175
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,600
The Shawnee Land and Cattle
Company.

176
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,400
- And who's the Shawnee Land
and Cattle Company?
- It ain't nobody. It's a company.

177
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
They got a president,
ain't they?

178
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,900
They got somebody that knows
what a shotgun's for, ain't they?

179
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Oh, son, it ain't his fault,
because the bank tells him what to do.

180
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
All right,
where's the bank?

181
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,800

And what's the use of pickin' on him?

182
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,500

and he's half crazy hisself...

his orders from the East.

- Then who do we shoot?
- Brother, I don't know.

185
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,800
If I did, I'd tell you.
I just don't know who's to blame.

186
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, there
ain't nobody gonna push me off my land!

187
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,700
My grandpa took up this land
70 years ago!

My pa was born here!
We was all born on it!

was killed on it!

They come.
They come and pushed me off.

198
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,800
- They come with the Cats.
- The what?

oh, about a month ago.

I don't like for nobody
to draw a bead on me.

Then what are you doin' a thing like this for,
against your own people?

What was the use?

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,400
He was right, and there wasn't a thing
in the world I could do about it.

232
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,200
Just, it don't seem possible,
just gettin' throwed off like that.

The rest of my family
set out for the West.

So now I just wander around
and sleep wherever I am.

I used to tell myself that
I was lookin' out for things...

so that when the folks come back,
everything'd be all right.

But I knowed it wasn't true.

There ain't nothin'
to look out for...

to death with a live chicken.

she had in her other hand.

- [Girl] Tommy.!

324
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,000
- What'd you do, son, bust out?
- * Tommy's out of jail *

325
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,100
- * Tommy's out of jail, Tommy's out of... **
- l... I knowed it!

326
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,600
You couldn't keep him in!
You can't keep a Joad in jail!

327
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,100
I knowed it
from the first!

328
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,300
Get out of my way!
I told you so! I told you!

329
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,200
Tom'd come bustin' out of that jail
just like a bull through a corral fence!

330
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,400
- You can't keep a Joad in jail!
- I didn't bust out. They paroled me.

331
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
L-I was that way myself.

332
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
How are you,
UncleJohn?

333
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,600
- Hello, Tommy. I'm feelin' fine.
- You can't keep a Joad in jail.!

334
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,700
- How are you, Noah?
- Fine, Tommy.

335
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,300
- Bust out?
- No, paroled.

336
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
- Hello.
- Tommy!

337
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,300
- [Chuckles]

338
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,000
The jailbird's back!
The jailbird's back!

339
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,300
Tommy's back!
Tommy's back!

340
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,600
[Grandpa Shouting, Indistinct]
Jailbird's back!

341
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,200
- Hiya, Al.!
- Hello, Tom. Did you bust out of jail?

342
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,400
- Nah. They paroled me.
- Aw...

343
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Rosasharn!

344
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,100
Busted out!

345
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
That's Connie Rivers with her.
They're married now.

346
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,100
She's due now about
three, four months.

347
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,000
She wasn't any more than a kid
when I went up.

348
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,100
- Hi, Rosasharn.
- How are you, Tom?

349
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,500
Uh, this is Connie,
my husband.

350
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,100
- Did you...
- I'm on parole.

351
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,400
Eh, if this don't beat all.
I see I'm gonna be an uncle soon.

352
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,700
- Oh, you do not!
- [Laughing]

353
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,100
- Here you go!
- Look at the front!

354
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,900
[All Teasing]

355
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,500
[Horn Honks]

356
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,100
Hey, Joad! John Joad!

357
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,100
- You ain't forgot, have you?
- We ain't forgot.

358
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,500
We'll be comin' through here
tomorrow, you know.

359
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,800
I know.
We be out.

360
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
We be out by sunup.

361
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
How'd you get
all this money?

362
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,000
We sold things, chopped cotton...
even Grandpa.

363
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,000
Got us about $200,
all told.

364
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,500
Shucked out 75
for this here truck.

365
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,300
Still got nearly 150
to set out on.

366
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,700
I figure we ought to be able
make her on that.

367
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Easy. After all, they ain't but
about 12 of us, is they?

368
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,800
- She'll probably ride like
a bull calf, but she'll ride!
- Tom.!

369
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, I reckon we better
begin roustin' 'em out...

370
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
if we aim to get out of here
by daylight.

371
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400
- How about it, John?
How are you boys comin'?
- All right.

372
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,600
[Laughs]

373
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
[Tom]
Ma.!

374
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm ready.

375
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Rosasharn, honey, wake up the children!
We're fixin' to leave.

376
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,300
Ruthie, Winfield,
jump up, now.

377
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:27,500
Ruthie, Winfield,
jump up, now.

378
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,200
- [Indistinct]
- Where's Grandpa? Al, go get him.

379
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm gonna get up front.
Somebody help me.

380
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
- Wait a minute...
- Somebody help me.

381
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,600
- * We're going to California *
- Here kids. Kids, you climb up on top.

382
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,600
Al's gonna drive, Ma. You set up there with
him and Grandma, and we'll swap around later.

383
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,100
- Where we go, Pa?
- Connie, help Rosasharn
up there alongside the kids.

384
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,500
- * We're going to California
We're going to California
- Where's Grandpa?

385
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,400
- Grandpa!
- Where he always is, probably. [Laughs]

386
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,200
Oh!

387
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

388
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, save my place. John, you and Noah
climb up and find yourself a place.

389
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,300
Got to kind ofkeep her even
all around.

390
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,700
[Squeaks, Creaks]

391
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Think it'll hold?

392
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,000
If it does, it'll be a miracle
out of scripture.

393
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,300
- Ma.! Pa.!
- [Muttering]

00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,200
Darn ya! Let...

- You little...
- There's somethin' the matter
with Pa. [Indistinct]

396
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,700
- Stand still!
- There's somethin' wrong with him!

397
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,400
Chicken! You heard...
[Mumbling]

398
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,000
[Muttering]

399
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,000
Should've left me alone,
that's all. That's all wh...

400
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,100
- What's the matter, Grandpa?
- [Mumbles]

401
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,400
What's the matter?
There's nothin' the matter.

402
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,900
I just...
I just ain't goin', that's all.

403
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What do you mean, you ain't goin'?
We got to go.

404
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
We got no place to stay.

405
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,700
I ain't talkin' about you!
I'm-I'm talkin' about me!

406
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,700
I give her a good goin' over
all last night, and I'm a-stayin'.

407
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
But you can't do that,
Grandpa!

408
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,800
This here land's goin' under the tractor.
We all got to get out.

409
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,500
All except me,
and I'm stayin'.

410
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
- What about Grandma?
- Take her with ya!

411
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,900
- [Laughs]
- Who'd cook for you, Grandpa?
How you gonna live?

412
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Muley's livin', ain't he?

413
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,600
And I'm twice the man
that Muley is!

414
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,900
Now, listen to me, Grandpa.
Listen to me just a minute.

415
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,900
And I ain't listenin',
either!

416
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,100
I's told you
what I was gonna do...

417
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,600
and I don't give
a hoot and a holler...

418
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,600
if there's oranges and grapes
a-crowdin' a feller out of bed!

419
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,600
I ain't goin' to California!
[Muttering]

420
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,800
This is my country,
and I belong here! Yes, my...

421
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,800
my dirt.
[Chuckles]

422
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:01,100
It's no good, but it's...
it's mine, all mine.

423
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Either we gotta tie him up and throw him
in the truck or somethin'. He can't stay here.

424
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,500
No, can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him,
or he'll get so mad he'll hurt hisself.

425
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,900
- Reckon we could get him drunk?
- Ain't no whiskey, is there?

426
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,600
Now, wait. They's a half a bottle
of soothin' syrup here.

427
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,900
Here. Used to put
the children to sleep.

428
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,300
- Don't taste bad.
- There's some coffee left.
We can fix him a cup.

429
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
That's right,
and douse some in it.

430
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Better give him a good dose.
He's mighty muleheaded.

431
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,500
If Muley...

432
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,800
If Muley can
scrabble along, l...

433
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,100
I guess I can.

434
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
I smell spareribs.

435
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,300
Huh. Somebody's
been eatin' spareribs.

436
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
How come I ain't got none?

437
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,300
Well, I got some saved for you, Grandpa.
Got some a-warmin' now.

438
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,000
- Eh?
- But here's a cup of coffee for you first.

439
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,700
[Mumbles]
Uh, get me a mess of spareribs.

440
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,700
I want a great big
mess of spareribs!

441
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,900
I'm-I'm hungry.

442
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,300
Why, sure,
you're hungry.

443
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:29,200
[Chuckles]
I sure do like spareribs.

444
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Yeah.

445
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,700
- Get up there, Noah.
- Put his feet in there first, now.

446
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,600
- [Squealing, Laughing]
- Lend a hand. Easy, now. Easy!

447
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,400
Better throw somethin' over him
so he won't get sunstruck. [Indistinct]

448
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,400
Everything all set now?
All right! Let her go, Al!

449
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,000
- Here we go!
- [All Chattering]

450
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
- Get aboard, Ma!
- [Grandpa Mumbling]

451
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,100
- Well, good-bye and good luck.
- Hold it, Al!

452
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,900
- Ain't you goin' with us?
- I'd like to.

453
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,500
There's somethin' goin' on
out there in the West...

454
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,600
and I'd like to try
and learn what it is...

455
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
if you feel you got the room.

456
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,400
- Mmm.
- Plenty of room! Get on!

457
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,800
- Hop on, Casy!
- Let her go, Al!

458
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,100
- California, here we come!
- You kids...

[Wind Howling]

461
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,900
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?
Give the old place a last look?

462
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,100
We're goin' to California, ain't we?
All right, then, let's go to California.

463
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,200
That don't sound like you, Ma.
You never was like that before.

464
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,800
I never had my house
pushed over before.

465
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Never had my family
stuck out in the road...

466
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,700
never had to lose everything
I had in life.

[Horn Honking]

468
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,400
- [Sobbing] I ain't goin'.
- It's gonna be all right, Grandpa.

469
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,000
- That's good right there, Ma.
- I ain't goin'! I ain't goin'.

470
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:25,600
I ain't goin'. I ain't...
I ain't a-goin'.

471
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,500
It's all right, Grandpa.

472
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,900
You're just tired,
that's all.

473
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:38,900
That's it...
just tired.

474
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,400
Just... tired.

Just a stroke and he died."

Figure best we leave
something like this on him...

482
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,800
- unless somebody digs him up,
makes out he was killed.
- Hmm.

483
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,400
Looks like a lot of times
the government's got more interest...

484
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,400
in a dead man
than a live one.

485
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,300
Not be so lonesome,
knowin' his name's there with him.

486
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,100
Not just an old fella
lonesome underground.

488
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,000
Won't you say
a few words, Casy?

489
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,100
I ain't a preacher no more,
you know.

490
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,300
We know, but ain't none of our folks
ever been buried without a few words.

491
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,200
I'll say 'em,
make it short.

492
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,700
This here old man just lived a life
and just died out of it.

493
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,100
I don't know whether
he was good or bad.

494
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,300
It don't matter much.

495

496

and he says,
"All that lives is holy."

497
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Well, I wouldn't pray just for an old man
that's dead, 'cause he's all right.

498
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:05,200
If I was to pray, I'd pray for folks that's
alive and don't know which way to turn.

499
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,500

he ain't got no more trouble like that.

Well, you can't tell.

00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,500
I figure when we get out there
and get work...

527
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,600
and maybe get us a piece of growin' land
near water, it might not be so bad at that.

they're payin' good wages.

540
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,400

that they need pickers.

some jackassin'. You can't shut up now.

The handbill says
they need 800 pickers.

545
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,300
You laugh and say they don't.
Which one's the liar?

546
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,400
How many of you all
got them handbills?

547
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,000

- Come on. How many?

00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,900

There you are...

"700 pickers wanted."

552
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
All right.
The man wants 700 men...

553
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,900
so he prints 5,000 handbills,
and maybe 20,000 people see them...

554
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,800
and maybe two or three thousand people
start west on account of that handbill.

that are crazy with worry...

he said. He put it down on his paper.

00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,400
Well, Connie, maybe
it's nice on the other side.

644
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,600
Them little picture postcards,
they was real pretty.

645
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,600
There, Grandma.
There's California.

646
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
[Spits]

647
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,000
Let's get goin'. She don't
look so tough to me, eh, John?

648
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,700
Well,
I don't know.

649
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,800
[Engine Starts]

650
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,200
- [Women Screaming]
- [Tom] Hold on.

651
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,300
Ain't too cold
is she, Tom?

652
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,600
No. It's fine
when you get in, Pa!

653
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,500
Come on, John.
Let's give her a whirl.

654
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,700
You know, this is supposed
to be good for ya, John.

655
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,200
- Come on, Pa, before she floats away!
- Here we come!

656
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,200
[Laughing]

657
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,300
- You people got a lot of nerve.
- What you mean?

658
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,600
Crossin' the desert
in a jalopy like this.

659
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,100
- You been across?
- Sure, plenty, but...

660
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,400
never in no wreck
like that.

661
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,900
If we break down
maybe somebody'd give us a hand.

662
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,900
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it.
Takes more nerve than I got.

663
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,700
It don't take no nerve to do somethin'
ain't nothin' else you can do.

664
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
Hope she holds.

665
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,100
[Traffic Passing]

666
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,800
[Weakly]
Grandpa.

667
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,500
I want Grandpa.

668
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,500
I want Grandpa.

669
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,900
Oh, don't you fret now.

670
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,300
Oh, there.

671
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,100
- Don't you fret now, Grandma.
- [Engine Cranking]

672
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,300
- [Engine Revs]
- Everybody set back there?

673
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,100
- Yep.
- All right, here we go!

674
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,700
Thank ya very much.

675
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,800
Holy Moses,
what a hard-lookin' outfit.

676
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,100
All them Okies
is hard-lookin'.

677
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,500
Boy, but I'd hate to hit that
desert in a jalopy like that.

678
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,300
You and me got sense.
Them Okies got no sense or no feelin'.

679
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,500
They ain't human. No, a human being
wouldn't live way they do.

680
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,900
Human bein' couldn't stand
to be so miserable.

681
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,200
Just don't know
any better, I guess.

682
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,200
What a place!

683
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,500
How'd you like
to walk across her?

684
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,200
People done it.
If they could, we could.

685
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,600
Lots must a died too.

686
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,800
Well, we ain't outta it yet.

687
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,900
- This here's the desert, and we're right in it!
- I wish it was day.

688
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,700
Tom says if it was day, it'd cut
the gizzard right out a ya.

689
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,900
I seen a picture once,
and there was bones everywhere.

690
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,700
- Man bones?
- Uh, some, I guess, but mostly cow bones.

691
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,800
I sure would like to see some of them
man bones. [Clicks Tongue]

692

[Labored Breathing]
Grandpa.

693
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,500
- I want Grandpa.
- Yes.

694
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,300
Now, everything's
going to be all right.

695
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,600
We got to get across,
Grandma.

696
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,100
- The family's got to get across.
- [Moaning]

697
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,400
There.

698
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,200
It seems like we wasn't
never doin' nothin' but movin'.

699
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,900
- I'm tired.
- Women is always tired.

700
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,900
You ain't...
You ain't sorry, are you, honey?

701
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
No, but...

702
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,700
But you seen that advertisement in the
Spicy Western Story magazine.

703
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,800
Don't pay nothin'.
Just send 'em the coupon...

704
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,400
and you're a radio expert...
nice clean work.

705
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,100
- But we can still do it, honey.
- I ought to done it then...

706
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,800
not come on any trip
like this.

707
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,900
- What's this here?
- Agricultural inspection.

708
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,800
We got to go over your stuff.
Got any vegetables or seed?

709
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,800
- No.
- Well, we got to look over your stuff.

710
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,600
- You got to unload.
- Unload?

711
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,300
Holy Moses.

712
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,300
Sorry, folks, but you'll have to get out
while we unload for inspection.

713
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,700
Oh, look, mister.
We got a sick old lady.

714
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,000
We got to get her to a doctor.
We can't wait! You can't make us wait!

715
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:26,000
- Yeah? Well, we got to look you over.
- I swear we ain't got anything.

716
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,800
I swear it.
And Grandma's awful sick.

717
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,900
Look.

718
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,300
You wasn't foolin'.

719
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,900
- You swear you got no fruit or vegetables?
- No, I swear it.

720
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Then go ahead. You can
get a doctor at Barstow.
That's just eight miles.

721
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,300
But don't stop.
Don't get off. Understand?

722
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,500
- Thanks.
- Okay, cap. Much obliged.

723

Look how pretty

- Wonder if them's orange trees, John.
- Look like orange trees to me.

730
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,100
- Well, they sure are pretty, whatever they are.
- Oh, yes indeed. [Chuckles]

731
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:57,000
Look at them haystacks.! I bet we could
sure have fun playin'over there.

732

Pretty, ain't it? Mighty pretty.
[Chuckles]

733

737
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,400
And we're still together...
most of us.

738
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,800
Didn't you sleep none?

739
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,800
- Was Grandma bad?
- Grandma's dead.

740
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,200
When?

741
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,800
Since before they stopped us
last night.

742
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,500
That's why you didn't want 'em
to look, huh?

743
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,600
Well, I was afraid they'd stop us
and we wouldn't get across.

744
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,100
I told Grandma.
I told her when she was dyin'.

745
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,000
I told her the family
had to get across.

746
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:52,600
I told her we couldn't take
no chance on bein' stopped.

[Takes Deep Breath]

748
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,900
So it's all right.

749
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,200
She'll get buried
where it's nice and green...

750
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,900
and trees and flowers
all around and...

751
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,100
She got to lay her head down
in California after all.

Right here.
We run outta gas.

01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,200
Where's the best place
to get work around here?

- Well, ain't it no good?
- Not here. Not now.

760
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,300
There was some pickin'
around here about a month ago...

761
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,500
but it's all moved south.

762
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,700
Hey, what part of Oklahoma

01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,000
- Sallisaw.
- Sallisaw?

764

Why, I come out from Cherokee County

- Well, you don't say!
- [Excited Chatter]

768
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,700
All right! All right!
Let's don't go into it.

769
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,800
What I got to tell ya
is this.

770
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,600
Don't try to park in town tonight.
Just go right on out to that camp.

771
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,100
If I catch ya in town after dark,
I got to lock ya up.

772
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,200
- But-But what we gonna do?
- Well, Pop, that just ain't up to me.

773

I don't mind tellin' you,
the guy they ought to lock up...

774
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,500

them things out.

779
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,300
Sure don't look
none too prosperous.

780

Want to go
somewhere's else?

781
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,900
On a gallon of gas?

782
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,500
Let's set up the tent,
and maybe I can fix some stew.

783
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,700
I could break up some brush
if you want me, ma'am.

784
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,800
You want to be asked
to eat, don't ya?

- Yes, ma'am.
- Didn't ya have no breakfast?

No, ma'am.
There ain't no work hereabouts.

787
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,400
Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff
to get gas so's we can get along.

788
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,100
Didn't none of these
have no breakfast?

789
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,300
I did.
Me and my brother did.

790
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,700

Well, I'm glad
some of ya ain't hungry...

793

Aw, he was braggin'.

Well, sir, I looked in
whilst they was a-eatin'...

797
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,100
and it was fried dough
just like everybody else.

798
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,900
Ma, how 'bout it?

799
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Well, I don't know
what to do.

800
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,600
I've got to feed the family, and what
am I gonna do about all of these here?

801
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,300
Give this to Ruthie.

802
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,400
Yeah.

But I got a stomachache.

- Wouldn't be no use.

808
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,200

- You doin' the hirin'?

- About 30 cents, I guess.
- Why can't you tell?

831
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,600
- You took the contract, didn't you?
- That's true.

832
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:28,400
But it's keyed to the price. Might be
a little more, might be a little less.

833
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,000
All right, mister.
I'll go.

834
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,500
You just show us your
license to contract...

835
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,400
then you make out a order... where and
when and how much you gonna pay...

Maybe he needs
a thousand men.

842
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,200
So he get's 5,000 there,
and he'll pay 15 cents an hour.

843
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,300
And you guys'll have to take it,
because you'll be hungry.

844
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,300
If he wants to hire men, let him write it out
and say what he's gonna pay.

845
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,500
Ask to see his license.

846
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,000
He ain't allowed by law
to contract men without a license.

01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,900
Oh, it's all right, Tommy.

1122
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,900
I wished you didn't do it...

1123
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:46,700
but you done
what you had to do.

1124
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,400
And I can't read
no fault in you.

1125
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,500
I'm goin' away tonight, Ma.
I can't go puttin' this on you folks.

1126
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,600
Tom, there's a whole lot
I don't understand...

1127
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:04,200
but goin' away
ain't gonna ease us.

1128
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:09,800
There was a time
we was on the land.

1129
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:13,500
There was a boundary
to us then.

1130
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,300
Old folks died off
and little fellers come.

1131
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,000
We was always one thing.

1132
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:23,000
We was the family...

1133
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,600
kind of whole and clear.

1134
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,800
But now we ain't clear
no more.

1135
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,700
They ain't nothin'
that keeps us clear.

1136
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:37,000
Al, he's a-hankerin' and jibbetin'
to be off on his own.

1137
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:40,800
UncleJohn's just
draggin' around.

1138
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,300
Your pa has lost his place.
He ain't the head no more.

1139
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,400
We're crackin' up, Tom.

1140
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,200
They ain't no family now.

1141
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:59,200
And Rosasharn,
she's gonna have her baby...

1142
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:02,000
but it won't have
no family.

1143
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:04,700
I been a-tryin' to
keep her goin', but...

1144
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,400
[Sighs]

1145
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:12,100
And Winfield.
What's he gonna be this way?

1146
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:17,000
Growin' up wild.
And Ruthie too.

1147
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,200
Just like animals.

1148
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,200
Got nothing to trust.

1149
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,500
Don't go, Tom.

1150
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,900
Stay and help.

1151
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:36,500
Help me.

1152
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:42,900
Okay, Ma.

1153
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,100
I shouldn't,
I know I shouldn't, but okay.

1154
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,400
[Vehicle Approaching]

1155
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:52,500
Ma, here come
a lot of people.

1156
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,900
- [Man] How many?
- [Man #2] Ten of us.

1157
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,300
House 25.
The number's on the door.

1158
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,500
Okay, mister.
What you payin'?

1159
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,600
- 21/2 cents.
- 21/2?

1160
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:06,600
- Say, mister, a man can't
make his dinner on that.
- Take it or leave it.

1161
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:10,200
There are 200 men comin'in from
the south that'll be glad to get it.

1162
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:12,700
- But how are we gonna eat?
- Look...

1163
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,500
I didn't set the price.
If you want it, okay.

1164
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,600
If you don't,
turn around and beat it.

1165
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,700
- Which way to House 25?
- Straight up the street.

1166
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,600
- That Casy...
- [Truck Engine Starting]

1167
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,500
He might have been a preacher,
but he seen things clear.

1168
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,100
He was like a lantern.

1169
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,700
He helped me
to see things too.

1170
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:45,000
[Ma] Comes night, we'll...
we'll get out ofhere.

1171
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,700
Like a lantern.

1172
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,600
- I'll start the car.
- Yeah.

1173
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,900
All right, Tom.

1174
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,200
Jump up, jump up!

1175
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,500
It's just till we get some distance.
Then you can come out.

1176
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,200
Or maybe get
trapped in here.

1177
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:24,300
Go get in, Ma.

1178
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,900
- Come on, John.
- Hey.! Where you goin'?

1179
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,100
- We're goin' out.
- What for?

1180
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,200
We got a job offer,
a good job.

1181
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:36,000
- Yeah? Well, let's take a look at you.
- Yeah.

1182
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:58,500
- Wasn't there another fella with you?
- You mean that hitchhiker?

1183
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,500
Little short fella
with a pale face?

1184
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,700
I guess that's
what he looked like.

1185
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,100
We just picked him up
on the way in.

1186
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:07,200
He left this morning
when the rate dropped.

1187
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,400
What did you say
he looked like again?

1188
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,800
Short fella, pale face.

1189
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:14,100
Was he bruised about
the face this morning?

1190
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,300
I didn't see nothin'.

1191
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,500
Okay, go on.

1192
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,500
[Engine Starts]

1193
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,700
- Goin' out for good?
- Yeah. Goin' north. Got a job.

1194
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,800
Okay.

1195
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,200
You done good, Al.
You done real good.

1196
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:01,400
- Know where we're goin'?
- Oh, it don't matter.

1197
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:05,100
We gotta go and keep a-goin' till we get
plenty a-distance away from here.

1198
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,100
Ow! Geez!
Hot on the hand.

1199
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,300
The fan belt's shot.

1200
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:30,200
Sure picked a nice place
for it, too, didn't she?

1201
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:34,000
- Got any gas?
- About half a gallon.

1202
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:36,800
Well, Ma, sure looks like
we done her this time.

1203
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:39,900
Lights up ahead.
Might be a camp or somethin'.

1204
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,800
Looks like about a mile.
Reckon she'll coast her, Al?

1205
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:46,400
- Got to coast it.
- Well, let's give her a whirl, huh?

1206
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:49,000
Come on, kids.
Get in. John!

1207
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,900
Ah!

1208
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,700
Oh! What was that?

1209
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,200
Oh, hurt yourself, John?

1210
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,900
- You hit it too fast.
- What's the idea of that?

1211
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,900
Well, you see,
a lot of children play in here.

1212
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,500
You can tell people to drive slow
and they're liable to forget.

1213
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:44,900
- But once they hit that hump, they don't forget.
- Got any room here for us?

1214
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,200
Well, you're lucky.
Howdy do, ma'am. How are you?

1215
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:51,300
- How are you?
- How do?

1216
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,500
Down that line,
turn to the left.

1217
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:56,700
You'll see it.
You'll be in number four sanitary unit.

1218
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,700
- What's that?
- Mm, toilet, showers, washtubs.

1219
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,100
You mean we'll have washtubs
with running water?

1220
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:08,400
Yes, ma'am. Camp committee will call
on you in the morning, get you fixed.

1221
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:11,000
- Cops?
- No.!

1222
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:14,800
No cops. No, people here
elect their own cops.

1223
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
The ladies' committee
will call on you, ma'am.

1224
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:20,300
Tell you about the children,
the schools and sanitary unit...

1225
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,800
and who takes care of'em.

1226
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:25,000
Will you come inside
and sign up?

1227
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,300
Drive around down, Al.
I'll sign up.

1228
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,600
Right this way.
In here.

1229
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:54,100
Now, uh, I don't want to
seem inquisitive, you understand...

1230
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,900
but there's certain information
I have to have.

1231
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,700
Uh, what's your name?

1232
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:01,900
Joad.
Tom Joad.

1233
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,900
- J-O...
- A-D.

1234
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:08,700
And how many of you?

1235
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Eight... now.

1236
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,000
UncleJohn,
you don't look so good.

1237
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,500
I ain't so good,
but I'm comin'.

1238
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,200
Shove!

1239
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:26,100
Campsite costs $1.00 a week,
but you can work that out...

1240
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:30,000
carrying garbage, keeping
the camp clean, things like that.

1241
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:32,200
We'll work it out.

1242
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:35,100
Uh, what's the committee
you're talkin' about?

1243
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,300
We have five sanitary units.

1244
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:40,000
Each one elects
a central committeeman.

1245
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,200
They make the laws
and what they say goes.

1246
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:44,300
You aimin' to tell me...

1247
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:47,600
the fellas that are runnin' the camp
are just fellas campin' here?

1248
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:51,600
- That's the way it is.
- And you say no cops?

1249
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,900
No cop can come in here
without a warrant.

1250
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,400
Oh, I can't hardly believe it.

1251
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,400
The camp I was in before,
they burned it out...

1252
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,600
deputies and some of them
poolroom fellas.

1253
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,800
They don't get in here.

1254
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:08,900
Sometimes the boys patrol the fences,
especially on dance nights.

1255
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:11,400
You got dances too?

1256
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:14,900
We have the best dances in the county,
every Saturday night.

1257
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,800
- Who runs this place?
- The government.

1258
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:20,000
Well, why ain't
they more like it?

1259
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:22,200
You find out.
I can't.

1260
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:26,200
Well, is anything
like work around here?

1261
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,400
Well, I can't
promise you that.

1262
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,500
There'll be a licensed agent
here later if you want to talk to him.

1263
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:36,000
- Uh, that cut you have...
- A crate fell on me.

1264
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,100
Well, you'd better
take care of it.

1265

you something for it. See you later.

1266
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,200

like it here.

1267
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:50,000
She ain't been treated decent for...
a long while.

1268
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,900
See you later.

1270
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,900
- Winfield, Winfield, get up.
I got something to show you.
- What's the matter?

1271
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,900
It's some white things made out
of dish stuff like in the catalogs.

1272
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:44,000
Come on.
I'll show you.

1273
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,700
Come on. Ain't nobody
gonna say anything.

Here's where
you wash your hands.

1275
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,100
- What's these?
- Well, I reckon you stand in them little rooms...

1276
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,600
and water comes down out
of that little jigger up there.

1277
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:18,300
- You take a bath.
- Oh, look. Just like in the catalog.

1278

- Hey, don't you go a-monkeyin'!

1279
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,800
Now you done it.
You busted it.

1280
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:27,400
All I done
was pull that string.

1281

1443
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:36,300
Maybe I can just
find out somethin'...

1444
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,900
just scrounge around...

1445
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
and maybe find out
what it is that's wrong...

1446
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:45,500
and then see if there ain't somethin'
that can be done about it.

1447
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:50,300
I ain't thought it
all out clear, Ma.

1448
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,900
L... I can't.
I don't know enough.

1449
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:57,600
Well, how am I gonna
know about you, Tommy?

1450
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,400
Why, they could kill you
and I'd never know.

1451
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:04,000
They could hurt you.
How am I gonna know?

1452
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:10,800
Well, maybe it's like
Casy says...

1453
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:12,900
Fella ain't got a soul
of his own...

1454
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,400
just a little piece
of a big soul...

1455
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:20,900
the one big soul that
belongs to everybody.

1456
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,400
- Then...
- Then what, Tom?

1457
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:27,400
Then it don't matter.

1458
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:30,400
I'll be all around
in the dark.

1459
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:33,900
I'll be everywhere,
wherever you can look.

1460
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:39,300
Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat...

1461
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,900
I'll be there.

1462
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,800
Wherever there's a cop
beatin' up a guy...

1463
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:47,700
I'll be there.

1464
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:50,600
I'll be in the way guys
yell when they're mad.

1465
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:55,500
I'll be in the way kids
laugh when they're hungry...

1466
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:58,100
and they know supper's ready.

1467
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:02,200
And when the people are eatin'
the stuff they raise...

1468
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:07,200
and livin' in
the houses they build...

1469
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:09,900
I'll be there too.

1470
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,900
I don't understand it, Tom.

1471
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:20,100
Oh, me neither,
Ma, but...

1472
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:22,500
it's just somethin'
I been thinkin' about.

1473
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,500
Give me your hand, Ma.

1474
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:33,100
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Tommy.

1475
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,100
Later, when this
has blowed over...

1476
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:38,300
you'll come back?

1477
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,500
Sure, Ma.

1478
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:45,300
Tom, we... we ain't
the kissin' kind, but...

1479
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:55,500
Good-bye, Ma.

1480
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:57,800
Good-bye, Tommy.

1481
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,200
Tommy.

1482
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:46,000
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1483
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,100
Be good.

1484
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:51,900
Bye.

1485
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:56,300
Hurry that up now. Get her rolled up.
How you fixed, John?

1486
02:04:56,400 --> 02:05:00,000
- Ah, gettin' along fine.
- Here. Here.

1487
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:02,400
Winfield, you get up on top now.
Get out of the way.

1488
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:06,800
I don't see what you folks are hurryin' so for.
They tell me there's 20 days' work up there.

1489
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:09,700
Yes, sir.
And we aim to get in all 20 of them.

1490
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:13,200
- All ready, Ma?
- Yes. How you feelin', Rosasharn?

1491
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:16,700
All aboard, everybody.
All aboard for Fresno.

1492
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:19,200
Wait a minute
and I'll give you a hand.

1493
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:22,700
- Careful of her now.
- Easy, child.

1494
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,800
She'll be all right.

1495
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:37,100
- Watch her, John. Take care of her.
- I'll take care of her.

1496
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:40,900
- How you fixed, Al?
- All right, Pa.

1497
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:47,300
Now, Ma.

1498
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,600
- Bye.
- Good-bye, hon.

1499
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:57,800
Bye-bye.

1500
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:02,100
- Bye-bye!
- Good-bye.

1501
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:04,500
- Bye!
- Thanks a lot.

1502
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:08,000
- Bye. Bye.
- Thanks for everything.

1503
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:11,900
- Be careful now.
- Bye.

1504
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:14,100
- Be careful.
- Bye.

1505
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:18,800
Be good. Be good.

1506
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:36,200
Twenty days' work.
Oh, boy!

1507
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:39,000
I'll be glad to get my hands
on some cotton.

1508
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,300
That's the kind of pickin'
I understand.

1509
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:45,700
Maybe. Maybe 20 days' work
and maybe no days' work.

1510
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,900
We ain't got it
till we get it.

1511
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
What's the matter, Ma,
you gettin' scared?

1512
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:54,700
Scared, huh!
I ain't never gonna be scared no more.

1513
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,900
I was, though.

1514
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
For a while, it looked
as though we was beat, good and beat.

1515
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,300
Looked like we didn't have nobody
in the whole wide world but enemies...

1516
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:07,500
like nobody
was friendly no more.

1517
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:10,800
Made me feel kind
of bad and scared too...

1518
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:13,400
like we was lost
and nobody cared.

1519
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:18,800
You are the one
that keeps us goin', Ma.

1520
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:21,800
I ain't no good no more,
and I know it.

1521
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:25,800
Seems like I spend all my time these days
thinkin' how it used to be...

1522
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:29,600
- Mm-hmm.
- Thinkin' of home.

1523
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:32,100
I ain't never gonna
see it no more.

1524
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:37,100
Well, Pa, a woman can change
better than a man.

1525
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:40,900
A man lives sorta,
well, in jerks.

1526
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Baby's born or somebody dies
and that's a jerk.

1527
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:48,200
He gets a farm or loses it
and that's a jerk.

1528
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:51,900
With a woman, it's all in one flow
like a stream...

1529
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:54,600
little eddies
and waterfalls...

1530
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:58,000
but the river,
it goes right on.

1531
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:00,300
A woman looks
at it that way.

1532
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:06,700
Well, maybe,
but we sure takin' a beatin'.

1533
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:10,500
I know. That's what
makes us tough.

1534
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,500
Rich fellas come up
and they die.

1535
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:18,000
Their kids ain't no good and they die out,
but we keep a-comin'.

1536
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:20,100
We're the people
that live.

1537
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:23,500
They can't wipe us out.
They can't lick us.

1538
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:27,700
And we'll go on forever, Pa,
'cause we're the people.
