<i>of the Second World War...</i>

2
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,697
<i>... many eyes in imprisoned Europe</i>
<i>turned hopefully, or desperately...</i>

3
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,707
<i>... toward the freedom of the Americas.</i>

4
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,578
<i>Lisbon became</i>
<i>the great embarkation point.</i>

5
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,960
<i>But not everybody could get</i>
<i>to Lisbon directly.</i>

6
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,045
<i>And so a torturous, roundabout</i>
<i>refugee trail sprang up.</i>

8
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,395

13
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,952
<i>And from Lisbon to the New World.</i>

14

- Hello, Ferrari.

187
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,876
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

188
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,542
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your caf.
- It's not for sale.

189
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,966
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

190
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,723
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

191
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,053
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

192
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,187
In refugees alone
we could make a fortune...

193
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,308
...if you'd work with me
in the black market.

194
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,892
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

195
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,152
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

196
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,403
Suppose we do.

197
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,982
When will you realize
that in this world today...

198
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,575
...isolationism is no longer
a practical policy?

199
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,499
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

200
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,745
Oh, I like it fine here.

201
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,370
He'll double what I pay you.

202

I ain't got time to spend
what I make here.

203
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,297
Sorry.

204
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,469

205
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,093
...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

206
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:54,263
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

207
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,467
Uh-oh.

00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,679
Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.

209
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,610
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

210
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,110
Where were you last night?

211
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,572
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

212
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,244
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

213
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,785
Give me another.

214
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,710
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

215
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,085
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

216
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,788
- Rick, I'm tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

217
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,339
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

218
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,084
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

219
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,515
Hey, taxi.

220
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,391
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

221
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,306
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

222
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,521
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

223
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,361
- And come right back.
- Yes, boss.

224
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,824
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

225
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,288
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

226
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,162
Someday they may be scarce.

227
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,628
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

228
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,417
Maybe get her on the rebound.

229
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,714

You would like to be on it?

235
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,363
Why? What's in Lisbon?

236
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,579
The clipper to America.

237
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,495
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

238
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,624
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

239
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,717
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

240
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,544
It's a combination of all three.

241
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,216
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

242
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,844

I came to Casablanca for the waters.

243
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,308
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

244

A gentleman inside

247
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,235
...and the cashier
would like some money.

248
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,819
I'll get it from the safe.

249
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,570
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I...

250
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,365
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

251
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,324
EMIL:
I'm awfully sorry.

252
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,586
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your caf.

253
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,466
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

254
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:33,052
A murderer, no less.

255
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,261
If you're thinking of warning him, don't
put yourself out. He cannot escape.

256
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:41,258
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

262
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,817
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

263
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,526
Major Strasser
of the Third Reich, no less.

264
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,863
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

265
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,614
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

266
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,702
RICK: I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

267
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,788
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

268
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,122
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

269
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:14,424
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

270
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,471
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

271
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,133
How observant you are.

272
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,179
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

273
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,342
Yeah?

274
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,934
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

275
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,058
There are many exit visas
sold in this caf...

276
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,066
...but we know
that you've never sold one.

277
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,728
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

278
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,194
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

279
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,611
That is another reason.

280
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,578
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

281
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,658
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

282
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,323
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

283
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,121
Victor Laszlo?

284
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,868
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

285
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,040
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

286
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,668
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

287
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,846
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

288
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,097
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

289
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,432
- Manages what?
- His escape.

290
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,518
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

291
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,562
He escaped from a concentration camp.

292
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,683
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

293
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,649
- This is the end of the chase.
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

294
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,192
Is that a serious offer?

295
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,690
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

296
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,703
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

297
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:23,700
- Okay.
- Done.

298
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,912
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

299
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,416
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

300
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,334
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

301
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,253
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

302
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,878
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

303
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,219
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

304
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,681
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

305
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,893
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

306
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:52,439
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

307
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,353
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

308
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,904
Laugh if you will, but I happen
to be familiar with your record.

309
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,232
Let me point out just two items:

310
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,573
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

311
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:08,661
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

312
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,164
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

313
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,667
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

314
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,956
- Maybe.
- Uh-huh.

315
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,339
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

316
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,295
I have my orders.

317
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,923
I see. Gestapo spank.

318
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,927
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

319
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,476
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

320
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,764
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

321
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,099
- I am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

322
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,482
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

323
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,491
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

324
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,582
I have already given him the best...

325
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,283
...knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

326
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,541
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

327
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,549
Yes, sir.

328
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:06,594
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

329
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,639
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

330
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,809
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

331
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:21,651
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

332
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,528
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

333
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,364
- Thank you.
- Very well, sir.

00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,866
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

335
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,665
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

336
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,379
I expected no less, captain.

337
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,172
Monsieur Ugarte.

338
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,041
Oh. Yes?

339
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,590
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

340
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,845
May I first please cash my chips?

341
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,716
<i>Dealer Speaking in French</i>

342
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:56,608
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

343
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,781
Thank you.

344
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,999

345
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,414
Rick! Rick, help me!

346
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:24,719
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

347
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,722
Excellent, captain.

348
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:36,565
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

349
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,808
I stick my neck out for nobody.

350
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,851
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

351
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:46,072
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

352
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,658
Okay, boss.

00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:50,495
<i>Band Playing</i>

354
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,117
RENAULT:
Rick.

355
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,867
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

356
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,918
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

357
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,247
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

358
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,915
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

359
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,091
We are very honored tonight.

360
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:14,429
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

361
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:17,557
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

362
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:20,346
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

363
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,561
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

364
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,317
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

365
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,111
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

366
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,742
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

367
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,576
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

368
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,291
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

369
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,204
There seems to be no secret about that.

370
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,880
Are you one of those people...

371
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,841
...who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

372
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,960
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

373
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,052
Can you imagine us in London?

374
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,675
When you get there, ask me.

375
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,304
Diplomatist.

376
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,639
How about New York?

377
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,136
Well, there are
sections of New York, major...

378
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:00,098
...that I wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

379
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,311
Uh-huh.

380
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,111
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

381
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,566
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

382
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,938
And that takes in the field
of women too.

383
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,364
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

384
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,402
We have a complete dossier on you.

385
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:19,410
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

386
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:23,169
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

387
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,963
And also we know why you left Paris.

388
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,083
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

389
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:28,504
Are my eyes really brown?

390
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:31,880
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

391
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,297
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

392
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:37,475
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

393
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:41,684
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

394
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,644
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

395
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:49,312
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

396
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:52,490
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

397
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:54,237
...until the day we marched in.

398
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,740
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

399
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,627
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

400
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:05,045
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

401
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:09,128
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

402
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:12,752
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

403
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,798
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

404
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,965
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

405
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,717
Perhaps.

406
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:24,763
Yes, monsieur?

407
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:28,809
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

408
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,716
Two Cointreaux, please.

409
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,217
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

410
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,515
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

411
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:08,608
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

412
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,980
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the caf.

413
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,533
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

414
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:16,690
Well?

415
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,204
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

416
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:23,906
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

417
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,584
The ring is quite unique.

418
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:31,378
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

419
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:32,956
What is your name?

420
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:35,465
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

421
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:36,835
Victor.

422
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,214
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

423
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,971
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

424
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,302
BERGER: Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

425
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,146
I'm sorry, it is.

426
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,148
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

427
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,353
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

428
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:53,692
Yes, what is it you want?

429
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:56,990
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

430
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,905
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

431
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,528
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

432
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:06,247
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

433
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,333
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

434
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:13,006
I was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

435
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:14,966
That was a gross understatement.

436
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,458
You're very kind.

437
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,169
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

438
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,676
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

439
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,680
- Captain, please.
- It's a game we play.

440
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,897
They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

441
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,562
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

442
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:34,695
Somewhere I've seen him.

443
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:36,447
RENAULT: Sam?
- Yes.

444
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,358
He came from Paris with Rick.

445
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:39,992
Rick? Who is he?

446
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,781
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.
Rick is...

447
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,490
- Is what?
- Mademoiselle...

448
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,292
...he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

449
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,908
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

450
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:53,663
But what a fool I am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man.

451
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,123
Excuse me.

452
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,128
Major.

453
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,799
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

454
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,006
How do you do?

455
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:06,177
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

456
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,886
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

457
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,222
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

458
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:15,528
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you are a subject of the German Reich.

459
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:20,148
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

460
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:24,115
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

461
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:25,912
This is hardly the time or place.

462
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:28,329
Then we shall state
another time and place.

463
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,534
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

464
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:31,950
With mademoiselle.

465
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:36,673
Captain, I am under your authority.

466
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,918
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

467
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:42,961
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

468
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,008
- Very well.
- Mademoiselle.

469
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,099
Mademoiselle.

470
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:51,730
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

471
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,981
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

472
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:59,072
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

473
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,945

Y fueron besos, dulces caricias

477
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:34,313
I must find out what Berger knows.

478
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:37,686
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

479
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,787
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

480
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:58,954
- Yes.
- Monsieur?

481
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:00,371
Champagne cocktail, please.

482
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,970
I recognize you from the news
photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

483
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:07,091
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

484
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,266
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

485
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:13,312
As you see,
it was true every single time.

486
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,016
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

487
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,725
I'm looking for a man by the name of
Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

488
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,691
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

489
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:26,075
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

490
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:27,816
I see.

491
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:32,373
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

492
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,747
Underground, like everywhere else.

493
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,747
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

494
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,328
If you will come...

495
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,124

Monsieur.

496
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,595
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

497
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,895
MAN:
Very well, mademoiselle.

498
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:03,402
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

499
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:05,149
Too bad you weren't here earlier.

500
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:07,737
We had quite a bit of excitement,
didn't we, Berger?

501
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:09,452
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

502
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,071
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

503
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,041
ILSA: Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

504
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,746
I never expected to see you again.

505
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,050

506
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,261
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

507
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,099

I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

511
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:51,652
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

512
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,572
He went home.

513
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:57,958
- Does he always leave so early?
- Oh, he never...

514
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,499
Well, he's got a girl
up to the Blue Parrot.

515
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,788
Goes up there all the time.

516
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:07,052
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

517
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,220

You're bad luck to him.

518

A kiss is just a kiss

529

Well, you were asking about Rick,

- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:53,070
Oh, you've already met Rick,
mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also...

541
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,570
This is Mr. Laszlo.

542
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,160
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

543
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:58,618
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

544
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,789
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

545
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,122
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

546
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,167
RICK: Thanks, I will.
- Well...

547
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:08,254
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

548
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:12,590
- Interesting caf. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

549
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,255
- What for?
- Your work.

550
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,137
Thank you. I try.

551
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,931
We all try. You succeed.

552
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,473
She was asking about you earlier, Rick...

553
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,011
...in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

554
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,440
I wasn't sure you were the same.

555
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,021
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

556
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:33,522
How nice. You remembered.

557
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,486
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

558
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:39,453
- Not an easy day to forget.
ILSA: No.

559
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:43,370
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

560
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:47,366
Yes. I put that dress away.

561
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,913
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

562
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:54,212
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

563
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:57,839
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

564
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,761
So it is.
We have a curfew in Casablanca.

565
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:04,308
It would never do for the chief of police
to be found drinking after hours.

566
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,265
LASZLO: I hope we didn't
overstay our welcome.

567
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,429
RICK:
Not at all.

568
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,310
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

569
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:13,109
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

570
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:17,236
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

571
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:19,152
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

572
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:21,404
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

573
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:26,417
There's still nobody in the world who
can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

574
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,416
He hasn't played it in a long time.

575
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,880
- Good night.
- Good night.

577
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,050
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

578
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,473
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

579
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,228
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

580
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,109
- Good night.
- Good night.

582
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:39,071
- Boss?
- Yeah?

583
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:42,611
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

584
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,488
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

585
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:45,819
No.

586
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,079
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

587
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,744
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

588
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,082
Good, then have a drink.

589
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,253
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

590
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:55,965
Boss, let's get out of here.

591
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,712

Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

593
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,637
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

594
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,515
We'll take the car and drive all night.

595
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,561
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

596
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:13,106
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

597
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,105

00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:38,043
And getting closer every minute.

670
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,383
Here, here, drink up.

671
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:42,931
We'll never finish the other three.

672
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:46,557
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

673
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:48,887
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

674
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:52,065
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

675
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:53,896
It's strange.

676
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:58,479
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

677
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:01,029
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

678
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:05,198
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

679
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:06,528
No, we must leave.

680
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:08,916
Yes, of course. We.

681
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:12,744
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

682
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:16,083
No, no. Not at my hotel. I...

683
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:19,839
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

684
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,089
I'll meet you at the station.

685
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,470
All right, at a quarter to 5.

686
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:26,551
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

687
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,053
<i>Stammers</i>

688
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,939
That's too far ahead to plan.

689
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:34,899
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

690
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:39,030
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

691
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:40,187
Oh, darling...

692
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,942
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

693
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,078
Hey...

694
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:47,361
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

695
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:55,628
I love you so much.

696
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,791
And I hate this war so much.

697
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:05,473
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

698
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,058
If you shouldn't get away...

699
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:10,603
I mean if...

700
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:13,138
If something should keep us apart...

701
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:15,975
...wherever they put you...

702
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:19,401
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

703
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:23,815
<i>Rumbling</i>

704
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,238
Kiss me.

705
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:29,579
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

706
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:37,046
<i>Yelling in French</i>

707
00:46:54,564 --> 00:46:58,313
All aboard! The last train
leaving in three minutes.

708
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:07,034
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

709
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:09,740
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

710
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:12,031
But this note came just after you left.

711
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:27,006
<i>Whistle Blows</i>

712
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,888
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

713
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:31,135
Do you hear me?

714
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:34,769
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

715
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:44,062
<i>Train Whistle Blows</i>

716
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:59,911
<i>Piano Stops</i>

717
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:29,319
- Rick, I have to talk to you.
- Uh-huh.

718
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:32,951
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

719
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:36,243
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

720
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:41,244
Why did you have to come to
Casablanca? There are other places.

721
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,788
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

722
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:46,507
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

723
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:50,093
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

724
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:52,340
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

725
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:56,177
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

726
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:58,895
I can understand how you feel.

727
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,896
You understand how I feel.

728
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,359
How long was it we had, honey?

729
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,479
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

730
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:09,234
Every one of them.

731
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,817
Mostly I remember the last one.

732
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:16,576
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

733
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,492
...with a comical look on his face...

734
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,660
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

735
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:24,829
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

736
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:27,498
Does it got a wild finish?

737
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:29,834
I don't know the finish yet.

738
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:33,428
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

739
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:39,676
It's about a girl who had just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

740
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:41,563
At the house of some friends...

741
00:49:41,732 --> 00:49:44,602
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

742
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:47,980
A very great and courageous man.

743
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,652
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

744
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,397
...full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals.

745
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:57,694
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

746
00:49:57,873 --> 00:49:59,616
And she looked up to him...

747
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,369
...and worshiped him...

748
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:04,378
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

749
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:06,669
Yes, that's very pretty.

750
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,541
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

751
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,506
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

752
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,006
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

753
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:21,516
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

754
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:27,564
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

755
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:28,851
Tell me...

756
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,903
...who was it you left me for?

757
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:34,909
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

758
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:37,944
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

759
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,587
<i>Door Closes</i>

760
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:06,854
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

761
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:09,397
I would suggest you search
the caf immediately.

762
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:12,606
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

763
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,904
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

764
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:17,648
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

765
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:19,904
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

766
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,994
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

767
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:27,085
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

768
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:31,086
It may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.

769
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:38,807
There is nothing we can do.

770
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:42,477
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

771
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:43,634
I slept very well.

772
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:46,433
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

773
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:50,016
- May we proceed?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

774
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:52,061
Thank you.

775
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,149
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

776
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:59,651
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

777
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,662
You have reached Casablanca.

778
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:04,577
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

779
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,909
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

780
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:09,837
Not at all. Renaults signature
is necessary on every visa.

781
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:12,710
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

782
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:15,208
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

783
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,508
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

784
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,804
STRASSER:
And mademoiselle?

785
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:23,508
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

786
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:26,603
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

787
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:29,441
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

788
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,517
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

789
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,900
- On one condition.
- And that is?

790
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:37,362
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

791
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:38,903
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

792
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:41,359
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

793
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:44,152
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

794
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,952
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

795
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:48,869
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

796
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,838
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

797
00:52:52,547 --> 00:52:54,706
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

798
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:58,668
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

799
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:02,713
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

800
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:05,850
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

801
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:08,634
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.

802
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:11,478
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

803
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:13,234
What if you murdered all of us?

804
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:17,731
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

805
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:20,231
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

806
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:23,943
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

807
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:25,745
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

808
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,452
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

809
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,167
But there is one exception.

810
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,950
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

811
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,047
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

812
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:38,750
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

813
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,469
This is still unoccupied France.

814
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,764
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

815
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:46,637
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

816
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:50,938
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

817
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:55,436
- Yes?
- I believe you have a message for him?

818
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:57,852
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

819
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:01,441
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

820
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,443
Signor Ugarte is dead.

821
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,578
I'm making out the report now.

822
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:14,325
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

823
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,879
...or died trying to escape.

824
00:54:18,508 --> 00:54:21,213
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

825
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:22,922
Good day.

826
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:29,978
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

827
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:31,135
Excuse me, captain.

828
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:34,356
Another visa problem has come up.

829
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:37,734
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

830
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:49,448
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

831
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:52,375
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

832
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:54,749
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

833
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,541
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

834
00:54:57,756 --> 00:54:59,832
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

835
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:02,169
MAN:
Thanks.

836
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,398
FERRARI:
Don't be too downhearted.

837
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,683
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

838
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:19,188
Thank you very much, signor.

839
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,769
RICK: Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

840
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:24,105
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

841
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:26,364
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

842
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:27,863
I never drink in the morning.

843
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:30,746
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

844
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:32,871
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

845
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,370
Here, sit down.

846
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:37,212
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

847
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:39,004
Bourbon.

848
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:41,213
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

849
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:44,550
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

850
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,757
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

851
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:49,971
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

852
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:51,422
Practically no one.

853
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,885
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

854
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:56,227
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

855
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,765
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

856
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,478
I'll handle the entire transaction.

857
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:03,315
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

858
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,024
And the carrying charges?

859
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:07,950
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

860
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,068
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

861
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:12,788
I'll tell him when he comes in.

862
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:15,578
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

863
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:19,079
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

864
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,796
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

865
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:31,305
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

866
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,432
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

867
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,053
LASZLO:
Morning.

868
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,763
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

869
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:48,068
MAN: You will not find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

870
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:49,564
Only 700 francs.

871
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,951
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

872
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:56,241
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

873
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,949
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

874
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:02,793
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

875
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:03,954
Doesn't matter.

876
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:08,082
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

877
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:11,298
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

878
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:13,098
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

879
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,971
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

880
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:19,763
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

881
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,971
Yes.

882
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:23,475
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

883
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:25,277
I don't think I will, Rick.

884
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:28,019
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

885
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:29,734
I think I'm entitled to know.

886
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:32,115
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

887
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:35,989
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

888
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,738
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

889
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:43,330
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

890
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:48,509
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

891
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,005
If we leave it that way...

892
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:53,506
...maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

893
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:55,089
Not last night.

894
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:59,017
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

895
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:02,058
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

896
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:03,940
You can believe that if you want to.

897
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:06,856
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

898
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:08,855
Above a saloon, it's true...

899
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:10,489
...but walk up a flight...

900
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:12,365
...I'll be expecting you.

901
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:17,240
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

902
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:19,157
You'll be there.

903
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:21,698
No, Rick.

904
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,370
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

905
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:30,006
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

906
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:39,135
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

907
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:41,220
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

908
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:44,183
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

909
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:45,976
...I am influential and respected.

910
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:49,567
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

911
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:51,565
You, however, are a different matter.

912
00:58:52,032 --> 00:58:56,409
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

913
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,948
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

914
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:03,415
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

915
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:05,412
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

916
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:09,039
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

917
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:11,631
We are only interested in two visas.

918
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:14,090
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

919
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,505
You two will want to discuss this.

920
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:18,639
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

921
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:24,312
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

922
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:27,850
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

923
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,901
But if the situation were different...

924
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:32,608
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

925
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:34,109
...would you take it?

926
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:36,398
Yes, I would.

927
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:38,782
Yes, I see.

928
00:59:39,955 --> 00:59:43,869
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

929
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:46,249
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

930
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:50,079
...and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

931
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:53,874
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

932
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,805
I love you very much, Ilsa.

933
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:01,139
Your secret will be safe with me.

934
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:04,308
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

935
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,805
Not more than 50 francs.

936
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:13,319
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

937
01:00:13,488 --> 01:00:16,857
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

938
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:18,991
Well, good luck, but be careful.

939
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:21,996
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

940
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:25,367
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

941
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:28,289
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

942
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:30,335
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

943
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:33,714
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

944
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:34,873
Yes, something.

945
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:38,255
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

946
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,423
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

947
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,677
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

948
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:45,384
Rick?

949
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,765
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

950
01:00:48,982 --> 01:00:50,607
But it is worth a chance.

951
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:53,980
Thank you very much.
Good day.

952
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:56,438
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

953
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,447
I shall miss that
when we leave Casablanca.

954
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:00,947
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

955
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,527
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

956
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:12,287
<i>Piano Playing</i>

957
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:14,589
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

958
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:16,919
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

959
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:20,884
I have to warn you, sir. This is
a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

960
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,381
Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything.

961
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:25,723
- Goodbye.
- It has been a pleasure to meet you.

962
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,554
I'm sorry.

963
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:47,077
Monsieur Rick, you are getting
to be your best customer.

964
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:51,498
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

965
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,579
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

966
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:56,081
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

967
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:58,250
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

968
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:00,715
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

969
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:03,010
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

970
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:05,091
You know how
that impresses Germans.

971
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:08,760
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

972
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,227
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

973
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:16,317
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

974
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:19,108
- It looks like you're a little late.
- Huh?

975
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,073
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

976
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:31,997
Who knows? In her own way, she
may constitute an entire second front.

977
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:35,918
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

978
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,167
Sascha!

979
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:39,373
French 75s.

980
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:43,258
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

981
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,758
We will begin with two.

982
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:47,381
<i>SPEAKING IN FRENCH</i>

983
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:56,022
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

984
01:02:56,234 --> 01:02:59,603
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

985
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:09,451
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

986
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:15,378
You see, captain?

987
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:18,001
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

988
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:20,089
We try to cooperate
with your government.

989
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,542
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

990
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:24,878
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

991
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,339
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

992
01:03:27,557 --> 01:03:28,838
I blow with the wind...

993
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:31,425
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

994
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:33,353
And if it should change?

995
01:03:33,605 --> 01:03:35,764
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

996
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:38,017
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

997
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:41,651
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

998
01:03:42,155 --> 01:03:44,860
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

999
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,278
A leader? Like Laszlo?

1000

Mm-hm. I have been thinking.

...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:03,292
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

1050
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:08,127
And then Captain Renault sees us,
and he is so kind, he wants to help us.

01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,635
Yes, I'll bet.

- Does he know that?
- Yes.

1055
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:18,551
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

...so that your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in the world...

1063

...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

1064
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:45,420
...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

1065
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:49,421
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

1066
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:51,384
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

Yes, I found that

But then I never was
much of a businessman.

- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

a million francs or three.

01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:34,844
How can you close me up?

1168
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:38,510
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1169
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:40,596
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1170
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:42,017
Everybody out at once.

1171
01:14:46,486 --> 01:14:50,401
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1172
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:53,361
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1173
01:14:53,535 --> 01:14:56,489
That is also true, except for one
destination: Occupied France.

1174
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:59,576
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1175
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:00,823
Of what value is that?

1176
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:04,037
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1177
01:15:04,212 --> 01:15:07,463
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1178
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:09,625
The French authorities
may find a reason...

1179
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,918
...to put him
in the concentration camp here.

1180
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:13,210
The other alternative?

1181
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:15,714
My dear,
perhaps you have already observed...

1182
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:18,138
...that in Casablanca
human life is cheap.

1183
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:19,638
Good night, mademoiselle.

1184
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:33,863
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1185
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,758
Our faithful friend is still there.

1186
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:01,847
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1187
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:03,183
I must.

1188
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:06,806
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1189
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:10,317
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1190
01:16:10,529 --> 01:16:12,356
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1191
01:16:12,531 --> 01:16:14,938
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1192
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:16,783
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1193
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:19,871
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1194
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:23,665
Victor, why don't you tell me
about Rick? What did you find out?

1195
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:26,206
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1196
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:27,956
But no intention of selling them.

1197
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:31,795
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1198
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:33,545
Did he give any reason?

1199
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,010
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1200
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:39,381
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1201
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,142
I don't know why he said that.

1202
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:57,408
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1203
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:00,612
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1204
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:05,155
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1205
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,702
When I was in the concentration camp...

1206
01:17:09,296 --> 01:17:11,834
...were you lonely in Paris?

1207
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,293
Yes, Victor, I was.

1208
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:19,215
I know how it is to be lonely.

1209
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:22,632
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1210
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:26,637
No, Victor, there isn't.

1211
01:17:31,276 --> 01:17:33,814
I love you very much, my dear.

1212
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:36,649
Yes.

1213
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:39,150
Yes, I know.

1214
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:42,401
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I..?

1215
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:45,284
You don't even have to say it.

1216
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:47,200
I'll believe.

1217
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:50,664
Good night, dear.

1218
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:54,001
Good night.

1219
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:03,725
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1220
01:18:09,022 --> 01:18:10,398
Be careful.

1221
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:13,561
Of course I'll be careful.

1222
01:18:56,903 --> 01:19:00,107
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1223
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:02,073
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1224
01:19:02,743 --> 01:19:04,023
Two weeks, maybe three.

1225
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,451
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1226
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:08,905
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1227
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:10,458
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1228
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:13,959
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1229
01:19:14,546 --> 01:19:17,381
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1230
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:20,669
- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1231
01:19:20,844 --> 01:19:22,042
I won't.

1232
01:19:23,221 --> 01:19:24,301
Good night.

1233
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:27,010
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1234
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:47,074
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1235
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:50,579
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

1236
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:51,994
Well, won't you sit down?

1237
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:56,081
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1238
01:19:56,255 --> 01:19:59,540
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1239
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:02,463
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1240
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:05,257
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1241
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,004
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1242
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:10,302
I know how you feel about me...

1243
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:13,229
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1244
01:20:13,397 --> 01:20:15,852
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1245
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:18,017
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1246
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:19,522
It was your cause too.

1247
01:20:19,736 --> 01:20:22,192
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1248
01:20:22,656 --> 01:20:25,361
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1249
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:27,568
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1250
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:33,946
Richard.

1251
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:37,702
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you...

1252
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:40,797
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1253
01:20:40,966 --> 01:20:44,417
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

1254
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:46,671
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1255
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:49,883
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1256
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,856
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1257
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:59,775
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1258
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:01,647
One woman has hurt you...

1259
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:04,530
...and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1260
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:07,236
You're a coward and a weakling.

1261
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:13,491
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1262
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:17,537
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1263
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:20,416
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1264
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:21,620
What of it?

1265
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:24,468
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1266
01:21:31,308 --> 01:21:33,135
Now, if you'll...

1267
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,801
All right.

1268
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,020
I tried to reason with you.

1269
01:21:39,191 --> 01:21:41,433
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1270
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:44,938
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1271
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:48,405
Put them on the table.

1272
01:21:50,243 --> 01:21:51,275
No.

1273
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:54,488
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1274
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:59,788
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1275
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:03,205
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1276
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:09,334
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1277
01:22:14,268 --> 01:22:16,141
Richard...

1278
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:18,683
...I tried to stay away.

1279
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:21,733
I thought I would never see you again.

1280
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:25,315
That you were out of my life.

1281
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:47,630
The day you left Paris...

1282
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:51,170
...if you knew what I went through.

1283
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:55,517
If you knew how much I loved you.

1284
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:59,353
How much I still love you.

1285
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:14,274
And then?

1286
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:20,659
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1287
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:24,369
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1288
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:26,254
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1289
01:23:26,423 --> 01:23:29,044
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1290
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:32,544
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1291
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:34,044
Then it came.

1292
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:36,423
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1293
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:40,217
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1294
01:23:41,647 --> 01:23:43,057
Then I met you.

1295
01:23:43,398 --> 01:23:46,732
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1296
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:50,028
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1297
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:52,730
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1298
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,154
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1299
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:59,655
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1300
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:01,374
...and for those working with us.

1301
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,325
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1302
01:24:05,379 --> 01:24:07,917
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1303
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:10,497
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1304
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:13,795
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1305
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:16,130
He was sick. He needed me.

1306
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:20,346
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1307
01:24:20,519 --> 01:24:24,469
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1308
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:27,267
Well...

1309
01:24:27,609 --> 01:24:29,269
...well, you know the rest.

1310
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,275
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1311
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:36,613
What about now?

1312
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:38,817
Now?

1313
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:41,163
I don't know.

1314
01:24:41,832 --> 01:24:44,868
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1315
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:47,117
And Laszlo?

1316
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:50,754
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1317
01:24:50,924 --> 01:24:54,258
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1318
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:55,922
All except one.

1319
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:58,800
He won't have you.

1320
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:02,719
I can't fight it anymore.

1321
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,805
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1322
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:12,854
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1323
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:15,106
You have to think for both of us.

1324
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:17,491
For all of us.

1325
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:23,790
All right. I will.

1326
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,627
Here's looking at you, kid.

1327
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:34,507
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1328
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:48,973
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1329
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:51,142
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1330
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:52,307
Come inside.

1331
01:25:56,615 --> 01:26:01,491
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1332
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,495
LASZLO:
Thank you.

1333
01:26:20,931 --> 01:26:23,089
RICK:
Carl, what happened?

1334
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:25,306
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1335
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:26,894
We escaped at the last moment.

1336
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:29,392
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1337
01:26:29,564 --> 01:26:32,898
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1338
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:35,773
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1339
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:38,730
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1340
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:49,914
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1341
01:27:00,887 --> 01:27:04,007
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1342
01:27:04,182 --> 01:27:05,926
This might come in handy.

1343
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:07,257
Thank you.

1344
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:10,099
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1345
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:14,859
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1346
01:27:15,027 --> 01:27:16,936
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1347
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:20,069
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1348
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,782
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1349
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,406
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1350
01:27:24,578 --> 01:27:26,820
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1351
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:29,155
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1352
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:31,574
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself...

1353
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:33,999
...of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1354
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:37,296
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1355
01:27:37,799 --> 01:27:40,337
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1356
01:27:40,677 --> 01:27:43,797
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1357
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:45,550
...and that you'll never succeed.

1358
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:47,966
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1359
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,343
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1360
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,937
I know that you're in love
with a woman.

1361
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:56,893
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1362
01:27:57,069 --> 01:27:59,986
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1363
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,313
The first evening I came into this caf...

1364
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:04,816
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1365
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:07,321
Since no one is to blame...

1366
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:09,739
...I demand no explanation.

1367
01:28:09,915 --> 01:28:13,200
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1368
01:28:13,377 --> 01:28:14,954
All right.

1369
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:17,038
But I want my wife to be safe.

1370
01:28:17,339 --> 01:28:18,750
I ask you as a favor...

1371
01:28:18,924 --> 01:28:21,841
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1372
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,125
You love her that much?

1373
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:26,097
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1374
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:29,261
Well, I am also a human being.

1375
01:28:30,102 --> 01:28:31,596
Yes, I love her that much.

1376
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:33,229
<i>Clattering</i>

1377
01:28:39,403 --> 01:28:40,683
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1378
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:43,400
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1379
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:44,563
On what charge?

1380
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:46,948
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1381
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:49,870
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1382
01:29:01,633 --> 01:29:05,797
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1383
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:08,296
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1384
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:10,056
You might as well let him go now.

1385
01:29:10,225 --> 01:29:13,226
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1386
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:14,889
If you were to help him escape...

1387
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:17,471
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1388
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:20,105
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1389
01:29:20,277 --> 01:29:23,397
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1390
01:29:23,572 --> 01:29:26,656
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1391
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:28,699
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1392
01:29:28,869 --> 01:29:30,244
They're all excellent reasons.

1393
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:32,369
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1394
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:35,990
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1395
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:40,913
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1396
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:42,584
Yes, I have the letters.

1397
01:29:42,758 --> 01:29:44,585
But I intend using them myself.

1398
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:48,503
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1399
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,765
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1400
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:53,891
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1401
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:57,643
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1402
01:29:57,814 --> 01:29:59,854
The last man I want to see in America.

1403
01:30:00,108 --> 01:30:03,275
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1404
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:06,612
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1405
01:30:06,782 --> 01:30:09,451
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1406
01:30:09,618 --> 01:30:13,829
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1407
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:16,038
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1408
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,331
...but people have been held
in Casablanca...

1409
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,120
...in spite of their legal rights.

1410
01:30:20,254 --> 01:30:22,127
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1411
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:23,287
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1412
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:26,134
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1413
01:30:26,301 --> 01:30:27,843
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1414
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:31,546
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1415
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:34,973
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1416
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:37,765
- Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
- Certainly.

1417
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:40,096
Germany...
Vichy would be very grateful.

1418
01:30:40,274 --> 01:30:41,305
Then release him.

1419
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:44,152
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1420
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:46,810
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1421
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:49,652
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1422
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:52,197
You get him, and we get away.

1423
01:30:52,369 --> 01:30:55,286
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1424
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:58,284
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1425
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,169
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1426
01:31:01,336 --> 01:31:03,661
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1427
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:06,508
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1428
01:31:07,092 --> 01:31:09,500
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1429
01:31:09,678 --> 01:31:12,513
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1430
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:13,926
I'm gonna miss you.

1431
01:31:14,057 --> 01:31:17,177
You're the only one in Casablanca
who has less scruples than I.

1432
01:31:17,436 --> 01:31:18,681
Oh, thanks.

1433
01:31:19,354 --> 01:31:20,433
Go ahead, Ricky.

1434
01:31:20,647 --> 01:31:23,352
Call off your watchdogs
when you let him go.

1435
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:25,393
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1436
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,520
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1437
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,693
FERRARI: Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1438
01:31:37,873 --> 01:31:41,123
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1439
01:31:41,418 --> 01:31:44,752
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1440
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:50,384
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1441
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:53,339
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1442
01:31:53,513 --> 01:31:56,467
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1443
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:59,091
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1444
01:31:59,269 --> 01:32:00,598
Well, so long.

1445
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:03,807
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1446
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:06,473
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1447
01:32:16,328 --> 01:32:17,359
<i>Stepping</i>

1448
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:28,706
<i>Knocking</i>

1449
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:42,342
RICK:
You're late.

1450
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:45,646
I was informed when Laszlo
left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.

1451
01:32:45,816 --> 01:32:48,852
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1452
01:32:49,027 --> 01:32:51,103
This place will never be
the same without you.

1453
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:54,856
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1454
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:57,785
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1455
01:32:57,953 --> 01:33:00,111
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1456
01:33:00,289 --> 01:33:01,451
Sam's piano.

1457
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:04,116
Serves me right for not being musical.
<i>Tires Squealing</i>

1458
01:33:04,418 --> 01:33:05,449
Here they are.

1459
01:33:05,961 --> 01:33:07,669
You better wait in my office.

1460
01:33:15,887 --> 01:33:17,216
Here.

1461
01:33:17,389 --> 01:33:19,962
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1462
01:33:20,142 --> 01:33:21,173
Not yet.

1463
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,934
But you were able to
arrange everything?

1464
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:24,141
Everything is quite all right.

1465
01:33:24,313 --> 01:33:27,313
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1466
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:29,309
Please trust me.

1467
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:32,606
Yes, I will.

1468
01:33:37,826 --> 01:33:41,906
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1469
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:46,827
LASZLO: I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1470
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:49,120
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1471
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:52,581
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1472
01:33:52,758 --> 01:33:55,083
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1473
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,668
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1474
01:33:57,846 --> 01:33:59,257
RENAULT:
Victor Laszlo.

1475
01:33:59,806 --> 01:34:02,511
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1476
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:06,888
The charge of accessory to the murder...

1477
01:34:07,022 --> 01:34:09,145
...of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen.

1478
01:34:09,733 --> 01:34:12,983
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1479
01:34:13,195 --> 01:34:16,149
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1480
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:21,361
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1481
01:34:21,536 --> 01:34:23,529
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1482
01:34:23,705 --> 01:34:25,864
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1483
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,868
...but I will if you take one more step.

1484
01:34:28,585 --> 01:34:30,827
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1485
01:34:34,049 --> 01:34:37,548
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1486
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:39,878
I do. We've got time
to discuss that later.

1487
01:34:40,055 --> 01:34:41,633
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1488
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:44,428
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1489
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:47,009
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1490
01:34:47,187 --> 01:34:49,263
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1491
01:34:56,822 --> 01:34:59,776
- Hello? Is that the airport?
- Huh?

1492
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,860
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1493
01:35:02,077 --> 01:35:04,615
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1494
01:35:04,788 --> 01:35:06,579
There's to be no trouble about them.

1495
01:35:06,999 --> 01:35:08,030
Good.

1496
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:10,949
Hello? Hello?

1497
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:13,790
<i>Buzzing</i>

1498
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:15,836
My car, quickly!

1499
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:17,377
<i>Speaks in German</i>

1500
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:18,916
This is Major Strasser.

1501
01:35:19,094 --> 01:35:21,550
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1502
01:35:21,722 --> 01:35:23,002
At once, do you hear?

1503
01:35:30,147 --> 01:35:32,186
MAN:
Hello, radio tower?

1504
01:35:32,357 --> 01:35:35,442
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1505
01:35:35,736 --> 01:35:38,191
Visibility, 11/2 miles.

1506
01:35:38,363 --> 01:35:42,278
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1507
01:35:42,451 --> 01:35:45,202
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1508
01:35:57,716 --> 01:36:00,468
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1509
01:36:00,636 --> 01:36:02,379
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1510
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:04,754
Find Laszlo's luggage.
Put it on the plane.

1511
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:05,969
Yes, sir.

1512
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:07,131
This way, please.

1513
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:12,139
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1514
01:36:12,314 --> 01:36:14,353
You think of everything, don't you?

1515
01:36:14,524 --> 01:36:16,980
And the names are
Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1516
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:20,735
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1517
01:36:20,906 --> 01:36:22,483
I don't understand.
What about you?

1518
01:36:22,658 --> 01:36:24,781
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1519
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:26,944
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

1520
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,912
Last night we said a great many things.

1521
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:30,990
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1522
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:33,835
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1523
01:36:34,002 --> 01:36:35,995
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1524
01:36:36,129 --> 01:36:38,667
- Richard, no...
- Now, you've got to listen to me.

1525
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,711
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1526
01:36:41,885 --> 01:36:45,171
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1527
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:47,636
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1528
01:36:47,808 --> 01:36:51,224
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1529
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:53,678
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1530
01:36:53,855 --> 01:36:56,181
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1531
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:59,229
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1532
01:36:59,444 --> 01:37:02,944
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1533
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:05,900
But what about us?

1534
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:07,487
We'll always have Paris.

1535
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:10,662
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1536
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:12,699
We got it back last night.

1537
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:17,374
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1538
01:37:17,879 --> 01:37:19,374
But I've got a job to do too.

1539
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:21,084
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

1540
01:37:21,216 --> 01:37:23,339
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

1541
01:37:23,927 --> 01:37:25,469
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1542
01:37:25,637 --> 01:37:29,089
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1543
01:37:29,266 --> 01:37:31,971
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1544
01:37:32,144 --> 01:37:34,682
Someday you'll understand that.

1545
01:37:35,856 --> 01:37:37,599
Now, now.

1546
01:37:39,234 --> 01:37:41,559
Here's looking at you, kid.

1547
01:37:50,537 --> 01:37:52,197
<i>Horn Honks</i>

1548
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:59,201
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1549
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:01,579
There's something you should know.

1550
01:38:01,798 --> 01:38:03,590
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1551
01:38:03,759 --> 01:38:06,878
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1552
01:38:07,054 --> 01:38:08,927
- You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
- Yes.

1553
01:38:09,097 --> 01:38:11,932
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1554
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:15,552
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

1555
01:38:15,979 --> 01:38:17,224
Yes.

1556
01:38:17,397 --> 01:38:19,437
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1557
01:38:19,608 --> 01:38:23,107
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1558
01:38:23,278 --> 01:38:25,816
But that was all over long ago.

1559
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:29,275
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1560
01:38:29,785 --> 01:38:31,409
I understand.

1561
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:33,785
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1562
01:38:34,456 --> 01:38:36,283
I appreciate it.

1563
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,917
Welcome back to the fight.

1564
01:38:39,127 --> 01:38:41,618
This time I know our side will win.

1565
01:38:55,352 --> 01:38:57,510
Are you ready, Ilsa?

1566
01:38:59,398 --> 01:39:00,773
Yes, I'm ready.

1567
01:39:03,902 --> 01:39:05,277
Goodbye, Rick.

1568
01:39:06,154 --> 01:39:08,028
God bless you.

1569
01:39:09,366 --> 01:39:12,071
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1570
01:39:30,137 --> 01:39:32,046
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1571
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:35,057
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1572
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:36,554
What you just did for Laszlo.

1573
01:39:36,727 --> 01:39:39,134
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1574
01:39:39,313 --> 01:39:41,638
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1575
01:39:41,857 --> 01:39:43,849
But she knew you were lying.

1576
01:39:44,026 --> 01:39:45,983
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1577
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:49,438
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

1578
01:39:49,573 --> 01:39:50,771
Especially for you.

1579
01:39:50,907 --> 01:39:54,111
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1580
01:40:01,168 --> 01:40:03,077
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1581
01:40:03,211 --> 01:40:05,500
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1582
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:10,173
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1583
01:40:10,344 --> 01:40:12,383
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1584
01:40:14,681 --> 01:40:17,516
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1585
01:40:17,726 --> 01:40:20,976
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1586
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:24,517
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1587
01:40:24,691 --> 01:40:26,565
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1588
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:43,161
Major Strasser has been shot.

1589
01:40:47,923 --> 01:40:50,592
Round up the usual suspects.

1590
01:40:58,290 --> 01:41:01,418
Allez. Cette voiture.
Vous allez l.

1591
01:41:14,283 --> 01:41:16,441
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

1592
01:41:16,576 --> 01:41:18,236
...but you've become a patriot.

1593
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,576
RICK: Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1594
01:41:20,706 --> 01:41:22,698
I think perhaps you're right.

1595
01:41:47,482 --> 01:41:51,183
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1596
01:41:51,361 --> 01:41:53,817
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1597
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:57,773
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1598
01:41:57,993 --> 01:41:59,238
I could use a trip.

1599
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:02,703
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1600
01:42:02,956 --> 01:42:05,827
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1601
01:42:06,001 --> 01:42:07,910
RICK: "Our" expenses?
- Mm-hm.

1602
01:42:08,086 --> 01:42:12,298
RICK: Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
