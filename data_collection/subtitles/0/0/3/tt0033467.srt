1
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,600
Rosebud.

2
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
News on the March.

3
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,960
Legendary was the Xanadu...

4
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,440
...where Kubla Khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome.

5
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
Today almost as legendary
as Florida's Xanadu...

6
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,240
...the world's largest
private pleasure ground.

7
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,160
Here on the deserts of the Gulf Coast,
a private mountain...

8
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,920
...was commissioned and successfully built.

9
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,440
One hundred thousand trees,
twenty thousand tons of marble...

10
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,480
...are the ingredients
of Xanadu's mountain.

11
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,320
Contents of Xanadu's palace:

12
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Paintings, pictures, statues,
various stones of other palaces.

13
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
A collection of everything.

14
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
So big it can never
be catalogued or appraised.

15
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,680
Enough for 10 museums,
the loot of the world.

16
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,880
Xanadu's livestock...

17
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,280
...the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea,
the beast of the field and jungle...

18
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,080
...two of each,
the biggest private zoo since Noah.

19
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,720
Like the Pharaohs...

20
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,760
...Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave.

21
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,480
Since the Pyramids...

22
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,600
...Xanadu is the costliest monument...

23
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,360
...a man has built to himself.

24
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,520
Here in Xanadu last week...

25
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,760
...Xanadu's landlord was laid to rest.

26
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,640
A potent figure of our century...

27
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,080
...America's Kubla Khan:

28
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,760
Charles Foster Kane.

29
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Its humble beginnings,
in this ramshackle building, a dying daily.

30
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,480
Kane's empire, in its glory...

31
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,800
...held dominion over 37 newspapers,
two syndicates...

32
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,360
...a radio network,
an empire upon an empire.

33
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,720
The first of grocery stores, paper mills...

34
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,440
...apartment buildings,
factories, forests, ocean liners.

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,240
An empire through which for 50 years...

36
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,320
...flowed in an unending stream...

37
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,080
...the wealth of the Earth's
third richest gold mine.

38
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,080
Famed in American legend
is the origin of the Kane fortune.

39
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,400
How, to boarding housekeeper Mary Kane,
by a defaulting boarder, in 1868...

40
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,720
...was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft:

41
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The Colorado Lode.

42
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Fifty-seven years later,
before a congressional investigation...

43
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,320
... Walter P. Thatcher,
grand old man of Wall Street...

44
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
...for years chief target
of Kane papers' attacks on trusts...

45
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,320
...recalls a journey he made as a youth.

46
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,280
My firm had been appointed trustee
by Mrs. Kane...

47
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,240
...for a large fortune she recently acquired.

48
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,920
It was her wish that I take charge
of this boy, Charles Foster Kane.

49
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,560
Chief, is it not, that on this occasion,
Charles Foster Kane...

50
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,640
...personally attacked you after striking you
in the stomach with a sled?

51
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,800
I shall read to the committee
a prepared statement...

52
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,240
...which I have brought with me,
and then refuse to answer questions.

53
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,240
Mr. Charles Foster Kane,
in every essence of his social beliefs...

54
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,840
...and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked...

55
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
...American traditions of private property...

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,280
...initiative and opportunity
for advancement...

57
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,720
...is, in fact, nothing more or less
than a communist.

58
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,360
That same month in Union Square....

59
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,560
The words "Charles Foster Kane"...

60
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,360
...are a menace
to every workingman in this land.

61
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,160
He is today what he has always been
and always will be: a fascist.

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,840
And still another opinion....

63
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,320
Kane urged his country's entry
into one war...

64
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,520
...opposed participation in another.

65
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,640
Won the election
to one American president at least.

66
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,520
Spoke for millions of Americans.

67
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,480
Was hated by as many more.

68
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,400
For 40 years appeared in Kane newsprint...

69
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,160
...no public issue
on which Kane papers took no stand.

70
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,160
No public man whom Kane himself
did not support or denounce.

71
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,880
Often support, then denounce.

72
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,280
Twice married, twice divorced.

73
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
First to a president's niece...

74
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,960
...Emily Norton, who left him in 1916.

75
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,400
Died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son.

76
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
Sixteen years after his first marriage...

77
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
...two weeks after his first divorce...

78
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,080
...Kane married Susan Alexander...

79
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,160
...singer, at the Town Hall
in Trenton, New Jersey.

80
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,040
For wife two,
one-time opera-singing Susan Alexander...

81
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,160
...Kane built
Chicago's Municipal Opera House.

82
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,280
Cost: $3 million.

83
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,880
Conceived for Susan Alexander Kane,
half-finished before she divorced him...

84
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,920
...the still unfinished...

85
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,320
...Xanadu.

86
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,080
Cost: No man can say.

87
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,160
Kane, molder of mass opinion
though he was...

88
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,560
...in all his life
was never granted elective office...

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,640
...by the voters of his country.

90
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,640
But Kane papers were once strong indeed...

91
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
...and once the prize seemed almost his.

92
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,320
In 1916, as independent candidate
for governor...

93
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,360
...the best elements of the state
behind him...

94
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,680
...the White House seemingly the next
easy step in a lightning political career...

95
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,720
...then suddenly, less than one week
before election...

96
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,400
...defeat.

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,120
Shameful, ignominious.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,360
Defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the U.S...

99
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,600
...forever cancelled political chances
for Charles Foster Kane.

100
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,880
Then, in the first year
of the Great Depression...

101
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,080
...a Kane paper closes.

102
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,560
For Kane, in four short years, collapse.

103
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,960
Eleven Kane papers merged,
more sold, scrapped.

104
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,040
Is that correct?

105
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
Don't believe everything you hear
on the radio.

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,800
-Read the Inquirer.
-How were business conditions in Europe?

107
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,800
How did I find business conditions
in Europe, Mr. Bones?

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,640
With great difficulty.

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,600
Are you glad to be back?

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,440
I'm always glad to be back.
I'm an American.

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,440
Always been an American. Anything else?

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,960
When I was a reporter,
we asked them quicker than that.

113
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,400
What do you think
of the chances for war in Europe?

114
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,120
I talked with the responsible leaders
of England, France, Germany and Italy.

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,360
They're too intelligent
to embark on a project...

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,400
...that would mean the end of civilization.

117
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,360
You can take my word for it,
there will be no war.

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,520
Kane helped to change the world...

119
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,560
...but Kane's world now is history...

120
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,280
...and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history...

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,240
...outlived his power to make it.

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Alone in his never-finished,
already decaying pleasure palace...

123
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,280
...aloof, seldom visited,
never photographed...

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,840
...an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire.

125
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
Vainly attempted to sway, as he once did...

126
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,280
...the destinies of a nation
that had ceased to listen to him...

127
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
...ceased to trust him.

128
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,880
Then last week, as it must to all men...

129
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,480
...death came to Charles Foster Kane.

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
News on the March.

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,160
That's it.

132
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Stand by.
I'll tell you if we want to run it again.

133
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,560
-How about it, Mr. Rawlston?
-How do you like it, boys?

134
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,720
-Seventy years in a man's life.
-That's a lot to try to get into a newsreel.

135
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,360
It's a good short,
but what it needs is an angle.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,160
All we saw on that screen
was that Charles Foster Kane is dead.

137
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,040
I know that. I read the papers.

138
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
It isn't enough to tell us what a man did...

139
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,040
...you've got to tell us who he was.

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,160
Wait a minute.
What were Kane's last words?

141
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,880
Do you remember, boys?

142
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,360
What were the last words
he said on Earth?

143
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed.

144
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,960
-Maybe he didn't.
-All we saw was a big American.

145
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,880
How did he differ from Ford,
Hearst or John Doe?

146
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,120
I tell you, a man's dying words--

147
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,840
What were they?
You don't read the papers.

148
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,400
When Charles Foster Kane died,
he said one word:

149
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,960
"Rosebud."

150
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,680
That's all he said? Tough guy.

151
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Yes, "Rosebud." Just that one word.

152
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,640
-But who is she?
-What was it?

153
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,080
Here's a man
who could've been president...

154
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,200
...who was as loved,
hated and talked about...

155
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,440
...as any man in our time,
but when he dies...

156
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
...something is on his mind called Rosebud.

157
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,360
-What does that mean?
-A racehorse he bet on once.

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,240
-That didn't come in.
-But what was the race?

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,120
Rosebud.

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,800
-Thompson.
-Yes.

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,880
Hold this up a week, two if you must.

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,720
Don't you think right after he's dead--

163
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Find out about Rosebud. Get in touch
with anybody who knew him...

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
...or knew him well.

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,560
That manager of his....

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,360
Bernstein. His second wife.
She's still living.

167
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,240
Susan Alexander Kane.

168
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,760
-She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.
-That's right.

169
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,280
See them all. Get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him...

170
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,760
...whoever loved him,
whoever hated his guts.

171
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,880
I don't mean go through
the city directory of course.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,520
I'll get on it right away.

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.

174
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,480
It will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing.

175
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,440
Miss Alexander.

176
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,160
This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.

177
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
I want another drink, John.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,840
Right away.
Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?

179
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,400
-I'll have a highball, please.
-Who told you you could sit down?

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,840
I thought maybe we could have a talk.

181
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,400
Think again.

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,200
Can't you people leave me alone?

183
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm minding my own business,
you mind yours.

184
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,840
If I could just have a talk with you,
Miss Alexander. I'd--

185
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,480
Get out of here.

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
Get out!

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
-Sorry.
-Get out.

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,360
-Maybe some other time.
-Get out.

189
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,080
Gino.

190
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,680
Get her another highball.

191
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,440
She just won't talk to nobody,
Mr. Thompson.

192
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,040
Okay.

193
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,600
-Another double?
-Yeah.

194
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,680
Hello, I want New York City.

195
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,320
Courtland 79970.
This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,480
She's....

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,560
She'll snap out of it.

198
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,160
Why, until he died, she'd just as soon
talk about Mr. Kane as any--

199
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,320
-Hello.
-Sooner.

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,520
This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.

201
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,720
The second Mrs. Kane.
About Rosebud or anything else.

203
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,680
I'm calling from Atlantic City.

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,480
Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,
to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.

205
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,320
They're expecting me.

206
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,400
Then I've a meeting with his
general manager in New York. Bernstein.

207
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
Then I'm coming back here.

208
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,840
Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.
Goodbye.

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
-Hey....
-John.

210
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,760
You just might be able to help me.

211
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,560
When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,
did she ever mention Rosebud?

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,280
"Rosebud"?

213
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,960
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.

214
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,840
As a matter of fact, just the other day,
when the papers were full of it...

215
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,040
...l asked her.

216
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,040
She never heard of Rosebud.

217
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,400
The directors of the Thatcher Memorial
Library have asked me to remind you...

218
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,560
...about the conditions
under which you may...

219
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,040
...inspect certain portions
of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.

220
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,520
-l remember them.
-Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.

221
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,440
-All I want is an hour--
-Under no circumstances...

222
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
...are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you. You may follow me.

223
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,120
That's all right. I'm just looking for--

224
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,560
Jennings.

225
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
Thank you, Jennings.

226
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,080
You will be required to leave this room
at 4:30 promptly.

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,440
You will confine yourself,
it is our understanding...

228
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,360
...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's
manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
That's all I'm interested in.

230
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,320
Thank you.

231
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,840
Pages 83 to 142.

232
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,720
Come on, boys.

233
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,280
Be careful, Charles.

234
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Mrs. Kane.

235
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,120
Pull your muffler around your neck,
Charles.

236
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,160
Mrs. Kane,
I think we'll have to tell him now.

237
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,360
Yes, I'll sign those papers now,
Mr. Thatcher.

238
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,720
You people seem to forget
that I'm the boy's father.

239
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,800
It's going to be done
exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.

240
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,560
There's nothing wrong with Colorado.
I don't see why we can't raise our son...

241
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,720
...just 'cause we came into money.

242
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,840
If I want to, I can go to court.
A father has a right to.

243
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
A boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind....

244
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,840
That property is as much my property
as anybody's...

245
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,840
...now that it's valuable.
And if Fred Graves had any idea...

246
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,440
...this would happen, he'd have made out
the certificates in both our names.

247
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,320
-But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.
-He owed the money to both of us.

248
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,640
-"The bank's decision in all matters--"
-l don't hold with giving Charles to a bank--

249
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,160
-Stop this nonsense.
-We're a bit uneducated--

250
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,040
"The bank's decision
concerning his education...

251
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,400
"...his places of residence, is to be final."

252
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,400
-The idea of a bank being the guardian--
-Stop this nonsense, Jim.

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,800
"We will assume full management
of the Colorado Lode"...

254
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,560
...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,
you are the sole owner.

255
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,080
-Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
-Right here.

256
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,320
Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.

257
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,560
You'd think I hadn't been
a good husband or father--

258
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,480
The sum of $50,000 a year...

259
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,080
...is to be paid to you
and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...

260
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,040
...and thereafter to the survivor.

261
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,800
-Let's hope it's all for the best.
-It is.

262
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,200
Why I can't raise my own boy
is more than I can understand.

263
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

264
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Everything else, the principal,
as well as all monies earned...

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,880
...is to be administered by the bank in trust
for your son, Charles Foster Kane...

266
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,640
...until he reaches his 25th birthday,
at which time...

267
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,160
...he is to come into complete possession.

268
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,240
Charles!

269
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,520
Go on, Mr. Thatcher.

270
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,480
It's almost 5:00.
Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?

271
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,880
I've got his trunk all packed.

272
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,080
I've had it packed for a week now.

273
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,280
I've arranged for a tutor
to meet us in Chicago.

274
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
I'd have brought him here with me, but....

275
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,640
-Charles.
-Look, Mom.

276
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
You'd better come inside.

277
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,880
-That's quite a snowman.
-l took the pipe out of his mouth.

278
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,480
Did you make it yourself?.

279
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,440
Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.

280
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,960
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

281
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
-Hello.
-How do you do, Charles?

282
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,480
He comes from the East.

283
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,440
-Pa.
-Hello, Charlie.

284
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,160
Charles.

285
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,280
Yes, Mommy.

286
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,920
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you
on a trip with him tonight.

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,680
You'll be leaving on number 10.

288
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,120
That's the train with all the lights on it.

289
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,960
You going, Mom?

290
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,120
No. Your mother won't be going
right away, but she'll....

291
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,640
Where am I going?

292
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,640
You're going to see Chicago and New York
and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?

293
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,080
He certainly is.

294
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
I wish I were a boy going on a trip
like that for the first time.

295
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,160
-Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?
-We have to stay here, Charles.

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,800
You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher
from now on, Charlie.

297
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,280
You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures,
well, that is...

298
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,040
...me and her decided this ain't the place
for you to grow up in.

299
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,320
You'll probably be
the richest man someday...

300
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,400
-...and you ought to get--
-You won't be lonely.

301
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,320
Lonely, of course not. We're going to have
fine times together, we are.

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,760
Let's shake hands. Come.
I'm not that frightening, am l?

303
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,280
-What do you say? Let's shake.
-Why, Charles.

304
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,720
-Why, you almost hurt me.
-Charlie!

305
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,400
Sleds aren't to hit people,
but to sleigh with.

306
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,920
Mom!

307
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,080
-You got to go.
-Jim!

308
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.

309
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,760
What the kid needs is a good thrashing.

310
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,760
-That's what you think, is it?
-Yes.

311
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,120
That's why he's going to be brought up
where you can't get at him.

312
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,200
Well, Charles...

313
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,760
-...Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

314
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,360
And a happy New Year.

315
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,200
In closing...

316
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,680
...may I remind you your 25th birthday,
which is now approaching...

317
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,600
...marks your complete independence
from the firm...

318
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,400
...of Thatcher & Company,
as well as acquiring the full responsibility...

319
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,320
...for the world's sixth largest
private fortune.

320
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,960
-Got that?
-"The world's sixth largest private fortune."

321
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,920
I don't think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy.

322
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,120
I am therefore enclosing
for your consideration...

323
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,600
...a list of your holdings,
extensively cross-indexed.

324
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,120
-"Dear Mr. Thatcher."
-It's from Mr. Kane.

325
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,320
-Go on.
-"Sorry, I'm not interested in gold mines...

326
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,960
"...oil wells, shipping or real estate."

327
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,040
Not interested?

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
"One item on your list intrigues me:
The New York Inquirer.

329
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,760
"A little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding.

330
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,280
"Don't sell it.
I am coming back to take charge.

331
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,360
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper.

332
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,960
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

333
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,080
"Traction Trust exposed."

334
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,560
"Traction Trust bleeds public white."

335
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,200
"Traction Trust smashed by Inquirer."

336
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,320
"Landlords refuse to clear slums."

337
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,560
"Inquirer wins slum fight."

338
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,760
"Wall Street backs copper swindle."

339
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,040
"Copper robbers indicted."

340
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,800
"Galleons of Spain off Jersey Coast."

341
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,520
Is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper?

342
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,240
I don't know how to run a newspaper.
I try everything I can think of.

343
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,840
You know there's not
the slightest proof this...

344
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,800
-...Armada's off the Jersey Coast.
-Hello, Mr. Bernstein.

345
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Can you prove it isn't?

346
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,640
Mr. Bernstein,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Thatcher.

347
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,120
-Mr. Leland.
-Hello.

348
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Mr. Thatcher, my ex-guardian.

349
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
We have no secrets from our readers.
Thatcher is one of our devoted readers.

350
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,680
He knows what's wrong with every copy
of the Inquirer since I took over. Read.

351
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,960
"Girls delightful in Cuba. Stop.
Could send you prose poems...

352
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,680
"...about scenery but don't feel right
spending your money. Stop.

353
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,720
"There is no war in Cuba."
Signed "Wheeler." Any answer?

354
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,320
Yes. Dear Wheeler: You provide
the prose poems, I'll provide the war.

355
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,640
-That's fine.
-l like it myself. Send it right away.

356
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,280
I came to see you
about this campaign of yours.

357
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,720
The Inquirer's campaign against
the Public Transit Company.

358
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,160
Do you know anything
we can use against them?

359
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
You're still the college boy, eh?

360
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,560
I was expelled from college, a lot
of colleges, you remember? I remember.

361
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,720
I think I should remind you of a fact
you have forgotten.

362
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,720
You're one of the largest stockholders
in the Public Transit Company.

363
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,920
The trouble is, you don't realize
you're talking to two people.

364
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,040
As Charles Foster Kane
who owns 82,364 shares...

365
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,680
...of Public Transit Preferred. See,
I do have a general idea of my holdings.

366
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
I sympathize with you.
Kane is a scoundrel...

367
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
...his paper should be closed,
a committee formed to boycott him.

368
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,680
If you can form such a committee,
put me down for a contribution of $1,000.

369
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,760
On the other hand,
I am the publisher of the Inquirer.

370
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,920
As such it's my duty, I'll let you in
on a little secret. It is also my pleasure...

371
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,040
...to see that the working people of this
community aren't robbed by a pack...

372
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,480
...of money-mad pirates, just because...

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,040
...they have no one
to look after their interests.

374
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,880
I'll let you in on another little secret,
Mr. Thatcher:

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,680
I think I'm the man to do it.
You see, I have money and property.

376
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,840
If I don't look after the interests
of the underprivileged, somebody else will.

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,960
Maybe somebody
without money or property.

378
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,280
That would be too bad.

379
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,040
I saw your financial statement today.

380
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,840
-Oh, did you?
-Tell me, honestly...

381
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,120
...don't you think it's rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise...

382
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,960
...this Inquirer, that is costing you
$1 million a year?

383
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,640
Yes. I did lose $1 million last year.
I expect to lose $1 million this year.

384
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,600
I expect to lose $1 million next year.

385
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,160
At the rate of $1 million a year...

386
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,440
...I'll have to close this place in 60 years.

387
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,320
"With respect to the said newspapers...

388
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,360
"...the said Charles Foster Kane...

389
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,440
"...hereby relinquishes all control thereof...

390
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,680
"...and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto...

391
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,840
"...and any and all other newspaper, press
and publishing properties of any kind...

392
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,280
"...and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto--"

393
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,240
-Which means we're bust all right.
-Well, out of cash.

394
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,480
All right, Mr. Bernstein.

395
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,360
I've read it, Mr. Thatcher,
just let me sign it and go home.

396
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,240
You're too old
to call me Mr. Thatcher, Charles.

397
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,880
You're too old to be called anything else.

398
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,120
You were always too old.

399
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,560
"In consideration thereof,
Thatcher & Company agrees...

400
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,720
"...to pay to Charles Foster Kane,
as long as he lives--"

401
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,560
My allowance.

402
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,720
"You will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large...

403
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,560
"...measure of control.
Measure of control."

404
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,080
And we shall seek your advice.

405
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,720
This depression is temporary.

406
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,680
There's always the chance
that you'll die richer than I will.

407
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,360
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born.

408
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,360
We never lost as much as we made.

409
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,320
Yes, yes, but your methods.
You know, Charles...

410
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,040
...you never made a single investment.
You always used money to....

411
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,920
To buy things.

412
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,200
To buy things.

413
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,800
My mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker.

414
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,600
I always gagged on that silver spoon.

415
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,400
You know, Mr. Bernstein...

416
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,600
...if I hadn't been very rich...

417
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,240
...l might have been a really great man.

418
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,120
Don't you think you are?

419
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,080
I think I did pretty well
under the circumstances.

420
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,320
What would you like to have been?

421
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,240
Everything you hate.

422
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,040
I beg your pardon, sir? What did you say?

423
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,680
-It's 4:30. Isn't it, Jennings?
-Yes, ma'am.

424
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,440
You have enjoyed a very rare privilege,
young man.

425
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,920
-Did you find what you were looking for?
-No.

426
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,960
-You're not Rosebud, are you?
-What?

427
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,880
Rosebud, and your name is Jennings,
isn't it?

428
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,240
Goodbye, everybody.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

429
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,400
Who's a busy man, me?
I'm chairman of the board.

430
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,320
I got nothing but time.
What do you want to know?

431
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,040
We thought maybe.... If we could
find out what he meant by his last words...

432
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,440
-...as he was dying.
-That "Rosebud"?

433
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,400
Maybe some girl?

434
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,160
There were a lot of them in the early days.

435
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,120
It's hardly likely that Mr. Kane
could have met someone casually...

436
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,200
...and then 50 years later, on his deathbed--

437
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,640
Well, you're pretty young, Mr. Thompson.

438
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,480
A fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn't think he'd remember.

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,680
You take me.

440
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,880
One day, back in 1896,
I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry...

441
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,080
...and as we pulled out,
there was another ferry pulling in...

442
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,680
...and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off.

443
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,720
A white dress she had on.

444
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
She was carrying a white parasol.

445
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,360
I only saw her for one second.

446
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,240
She didn't see me at all,
but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since...

447
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,480
...that I haven't thought of that girl.

448
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,040
-Who else have you been to see?
-Well, I went down to Atlantic City.

449
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,880
Susie?

450
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,280
Thank you.

451
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,760
I called her myself the day after he died.

452
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,320
I thought maybe somebody ought to.

453
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,120
-She couldn't even come to the phone.
-I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days.

454
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,920
About Rosebud, Mr. Bernstein.

455
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,480
If you'd talk about anything connected
with Mr. Kane that you can remember.

456
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,880
You were with him from the beginning.

457
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,200
From before the beginning, young fellow.
And now it's after the end.

458
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,240
Have you tried to see anybody
except Susie?

459
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,160
I haven't seen anybody else, but I've
been through Walter Thatcher's journal.

460
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,280
-That man was the biggest fool I ever met.
-He made an awful lot of money.

461
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,680
Well, it's no trick to make a lot of money...

462
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,040
...if all you want is to make a lot of money.

463
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,120
You take Mr. Kane.
It wasn't money he wanted.

464
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,040
Thatcher never did figure him out.
Sometimes even I couldn't.

465
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,280
You know who you ought to see?
Mr. Leland.

466
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960
He was Mr. Kane's closest friend.
They went to school together.

467
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,120
Harvard?

468
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,520
Oh, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Cornell, Switzerland.

469
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,520
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges.

470
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,520
Mr. Leland never had a nickel.

471
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,880
One of those families
where the father is worth $10 million...

472
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,120
...then one day he shoots himself,
and it turns out there's nothing but debts.

473
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,160
He was with Mr. Kane and me...

474
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,800
...the first day Mr. Kane took over
the Inquirer.

475
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,400
Take a good look at it, Jedediah.

476
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,720
It's going to look a lot different
one of these days. Come on.

477
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,160
There ain't no bedrooms in this joint.
That's a newspaper building.

478
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,600
You're getting paid, mister,
for opinions or for hauling?

479
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,800
-Jedediah.
-After you, Mr. Kane.

480
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,120
Excuse me, sir, but l....

481
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,280
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

482
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,640
Welcome to the Inquirer, Mr. Kane.

483
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,200
I am Herbert Carter, the editor-in-chief.

484
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,760
-Thank you, Mr. Carter. This is Mr. Leland--
-How do you do, Mr. Leland?

485
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,840
Our new dramatic critic.
I hope I haven't made a mistake.

486
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,160
-It is dramatic critic, right?
-That's right.

487
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,480
-Are they standing for me?
-You? Oh, Mr. Kane.

488
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,840
Standing?

489
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,560
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

490
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,280
I thought it would be a nice little gesture.

491
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
-Ask them to sit down, will you, please.
-The new publisher.

492
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,720
-You may resume your duties, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

493
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
-l didn't know your plans.
-l don't know my plans myself.

494
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,240
-Matter of fact, I haven't got any plans.
-No?

495
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,920
Except to get out a newspaper.

496
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,240
-Mr. Bernstein.
-Yes, Mr. Kane.

497
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,280
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein.

498
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,800
-Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
-How do you do, Mr. Carter?

499
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,800
-Mr. Carter.
-How do you do?

500
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,240
-Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
-Stein.

501
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,520
-Kane.
-Mr. Carter, is this your office?

502
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,960
My little private sanctum
is at your disposal.

503
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,280
-Excuse me.
-But I don't think I understand.

504
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,840
Mr. Carter, I'm going to live right here
in your office as long as I have to.

505
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,880
Live here? Yes?

506
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,840
-Excuse me.
-But a morning newspaper, after all--

507
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,800
Excuse me.

508
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,720
We're practically closed for 12 hours a day.

509
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's one of the things
that's going to have to be changed here.

510
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,400
-The news goes on for 24 hours a day.
-24?

511
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,200
-That's right.
-Excuse me.

512
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,640
It's impossible....

513
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,840
I've drawn that cartoon.
I'm no good as a cartoonist.

514
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,520
You certainly aren't.

515
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,760
You're the dramatic critic, Leland.

516
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,920
-You still eating?
-I'm still hungry.

517
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Here's a front-page story in the Chronicle...

518
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
...about a Mrs. Harry Silverstone
in Brooklyn who's missing.

519
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,440
She's probably murdered. Why isn't
there something about it in the Inquirer?

520
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,760
We're running a newspaper...

521
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,840
-I'm absolutely starving to death.
-...not a scandal sheet.

522
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,200
That's all right.

523
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,840
Mr. Carter, here is a three-column headline
in the Chronicle.

524
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,440
Why hasn't the Inquirer
a three-column headline?

525
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,400
The news wasn't big enough.

526
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,560
Mr. Carter, if the headline is big enough,
it makes the news big enough.

527
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,520
-That's right!
-The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone--

528
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,120
There's no proof
that she was murdered, or dead.

529
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,760
It says she's missing.
The neighbors are getting suspicious.

530
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,760
It's not our function
to report the gossip of housewives.

531
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,080
If we were interested in that kind of thing,
we could fill the paper twice over, daily.

532
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,240
That's the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on.

533
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,840
I want you to send your best man
to see Mr. Silverstone.

534
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,720
Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't
produce his wife, Mrs. Silverstone...

535
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
...the Inquirer will have him arrested.

536
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,360
Tell Mr. Silverstone
he's a detective from....

537
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,360
-Central Office.
-The Central Office.

538
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,320
If Mr. Silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man's badge...

539
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,680
...your man is to get indignant
and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist.

540
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,080
Loudly, so the neighbors can hear.
You ready for dinner, Jedediah?

541
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,120
I can't see that the function
of a respectable newspaper--

542
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Thank you so much, Mr. Carter. Goodbye.

543
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,200
Goodbye.

544
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,720
Paper! Read all about it!

545
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,800
Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.

546
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,360
The mystery of the lady
that vanished in Brooklyn.

547
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
Read all about it
in the early morning Chronicle.

548
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,480
We'll be on the street soon,
Charlie, another 10 minutes.

549
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,600
Three hours and 50 minutes late,
but we did it.

550
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,480
-Tired?
-A tough day.

551
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,560
-A wasted day.
-Wasted?

552
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,800
You only made the paper over
four times tonight, that's all.

553
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,320
I've changed the front page a little,
Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough.

554
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,080
There's something I've got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print.

555
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I've got to make the New York Inquirer
as important to New York...

556
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,840
...as the gas in that light.

557
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,720
What are you going to do, Charlie?

558
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
My Declaration of Principles.
Don't smile, Jedediah.

559
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,360
I've got it all written out here.

560
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,920
You don't want to make any promises
you don't want to keep.

561
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,600
These'll be kept.

562
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,400
"I'll provide the people of this city...

563
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,440
"...with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly.

564
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,200
-"l will also provide--"
-That's two sentences starting with "l."

565
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,480
People will know who's responsible...

566
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,880
...and they'll get the truth in the Inquirer,
quickly, simply and entertainingly.

567
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,240
No special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth.

568
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,720
"l will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights...

569
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,520
"...as citizens and as human beings."

570
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,240
Signed:

571
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,480
"Charles Foster Kane."

572
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,560
-Can I have that, Charlie?
-I'm going to print it.

573
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Solly!

574
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,040
Yes, Mr. Kane?

575
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,720
I want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page.

576
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,440
This morning's front page?

577
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,920
That's right, Solly,
that means we'll have to remake again.

578
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,760
-Yes.
-Go down and tell them.

579
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,280
All right.

580
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,520
When you're through with that,
I'd like to have it back.

581
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,200
I'd like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself.

582
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,920
I have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important.

583
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,120
-A document...
-Sure.

584
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,280
...like the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution...

585
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,480
...and my first report card at school.

586
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,200
I know you're tired, gentlemen,
but I brought you here for a reason.

587
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,520
-This little pilgrimage will do us good.
-The Chronicle's a good newspaper.

588
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,960
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper.
Notice the circulation.

589
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,680
495,000.
But look who's working for the Chronicle.

590
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,080
-With them, it's no trick to get circulation.
-You're right.

591
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,160
You know how long it took the Chronicle
to get that staff together?

592
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,680
-Twenty years.
-Twenty years?

593
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,880
Six years ago, I looked at a picture
of the world's greatest newspaper men.

594
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,120
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store.

595
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,840
Tonight, six years later,
I got my candy, all of it.

596
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,880
Welcome, gentlemen, to the Inquirer.

597
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Make an extra copy of that picture
and mail it to the Chronicle.

598
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,240
It'll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning...

599
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,720
...was the greatest in New York: 684,000.

600
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,880
684,132.

601
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,120
Right.

602
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,520
I hope you'll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you.

603
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation.

604
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,400
I've promised my doctor for sometime
that I would leave when I could.

605
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,880
I now realize I can't.

606
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,520
Say, Mr. Kane,
as long as you're promising...

607
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,760
...there's a lot of pictures and statues
in Europe you ain't bought yet.

608
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,840
You can't blame me, Mr. Bernstein.

609
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,560
They've been making statues
for 2,000 years.

610
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And I've only been buying for five.

611
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,440
-Promise me, Mr. Kane.
-l promise, Mr. Bernstein.

612
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,720
-Thank you.
-Mr. Bernstein?

613
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,120
You don't expect me to keep
any of those promises, do you?

614
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,040
And now, gentlemen!

615
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,120
Your complete attention, if you please.

616
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,960
Are we going to declare war on Spain?

617
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,400
Oh, mama, here they come.
Shoot me while I'm happy.

618
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,080
I said, "Are we going to declare
war on Spain, or are we not?"

619
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,760
The Inquirer already has.

620
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,680
You long-faced, overdressed anarchist.

621
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,720
I'm not overdressed.

622
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,040
You are, too.
Mr. Bernstein, look at his necktie.

623
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,080
Let's have the song about Charlie.

624
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,240
-Is there a song about Charlie?
-Is there a song about you, Mr. Kane?

625
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,160
You buy a bag of peanuts in this town,
you get a song written about you.

626
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,240
I've seen that fellow. He's good.

627
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,320
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

628
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,840
"There is a man, a certain man

629
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,200
"And for the poor you may be sure
that he'll do all he can

630
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,320
"Who is this one? This favorite son

631
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,840
"Just by his action
has the traction magnates on the run

632
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,160
"Who loves to smoke, enjoys a joke

633
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,920
"Who wouldn't get a bit upset
if he were really broke

634
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,040
"With wealth and fame he's still the same

635
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,400
"I'll bet you $5 you're not alive
if you don't know his name

636
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,400
"What is his name?

637
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,440
"It's Charlie Kane, it's Mister Kane!

638
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,680
"He doesn't like that Mister
He likes good old Charlie Kane"

639
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,920
-isn't it wonderful? Such a party.
-Yes.

640
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,720
What's the matter?

641
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,160
"Who says a miss was made to kiss

642
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,120
"And when he meets one
always tries to do exactly this

643
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,920
"Who buys the food, who buys the drinks

644
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,240
"Who thinks that dough was made
to spend and acts the way he thinks

645
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,640
"Now is it, Joe, no, no, no"

646
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,560
Bernstein, these men
who are now with the Inquirer...

647
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,600
...who were with the Chronicle
until yesterday--

648
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,520
Oh, mama, please.

649
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,440
-Give me that.
-What? The blonde?

650
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,520
-No, the brunette.
-Where did you learn that, Charlie?

651
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,040
Bernstein, these men
who were with the Chronicle...

652
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,960
...weren't they just as devoted
to the Chronicle policy...

653
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,120
...as they are now to our policies?

654
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,640
Sure, they're just like anybody else.

655
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
They got work to do, they do it.

656
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,840
Only they happen to be
the best men in the business.

657
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,160
Do we stand for the same things
the Chronicle stands for?

658
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,720
Certainly not.

659
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,840
Listen, Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

660
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,680
There's always a chance, of course,
that they'll change Mr. Kane.

661
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,360
Without his knowing it.

662
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,440
Mr. Leland, I got a cable from Mr. Kane!

663
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,600
-l got a cable here from Mr. Kane.
-What?

664
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,840
-From Paris, France.
-What?

665
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,880
-From Paris, France.
-Come on in.

666
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,720
"Who by his action
has the traction magnates on the run"

667
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,920
It's a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues.

668
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,600
Look, he wants to buy
the world's biggest diamond.

669
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,400
Why didn't you go to Europe with him?
He wanted you to.

670
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,640
I wanted Charlie to have fun,
with me along....

671
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,080
Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt?

672
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,520
Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?
Am I a New England schoolmarm?

673
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,280
Yes.

674
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,360
If you thought I'd answer you different
from what Mr. Kane tells you, I wouldn't.

675
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,400
"World's biggest diamond."

676
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,280
I didn't know Charlie
was collecting diamonds.

677
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,440
He ain't.

678
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,080
He's collecting somebody
that's collecting diamonds.

679
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,960
Anyway, he ain't only collecting statues.

680
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane...

681
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,600
"...from 467 employees
of the New York Inquirer."

682
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,480
Here he comes!

683
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,720
Welcome, Mr. Kane.

684
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,760
-l know I've a moustache.
-It looks awful.

685
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,440
Have we got a society editor?

686
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,800
-Right here, Mr. Kane.
-Miss Townsend is the society editor.

687
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,560
Miss Townsend,
this is Mr. Charles Foster Kane.

688
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,960
Miss Townsend, I've been away so long.
I don't know your routine.

689
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I got a little social announcement.

690
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,800
I wish you wouldn't treat this
any differently than you would any other...

691
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,560
...social announcement.

692
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,920
Mr. Kane, on behalf of all the employees
of the Inquirer--

693
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,400
Mr. Bernstein,
thank you very much, everybody, l....

694
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,960
I'm sorry, I can't accept it now.

695
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,400
Goodbye.

696
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,120
Say, he was in an awful hurry.

697
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,040
Hey, everybody, look out here.

698
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,880
Let's go to the window.

699
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,800
-Mr. Leland! Mr. Bernstein!
-Yes, Ms. Townsend?

700
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,720
This announcement:
"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Monroe Norton...

701
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,400
"...announce the engagement
of their daughter, Emily Monroe Norton...

702
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,680
"...to Mr. Charles Foster Kane."

703
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,480
Come on.

704
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,680
Emily Monroe Norton, she's the niece
of the President of the United States.

705
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,800
President's niece?

706
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,200
Before he's through,
she'll be a president's wife.

707
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,280
The way things turned out,
I don't need to tell you.

708
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,600
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud.

709
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It didn't end very well, did it?

710
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,240
It ended.

711
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,360
Then there was Susie. That ended, too.

712
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,520
You know, Mr. Thompson, I was thinking...

713
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,800
...this Rosebud
you're trying to find out about....

714
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,280
Yes?

715
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,320
Maybe that was something he lost.

716
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,240
Mr. Kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had.

717
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,160
You ought to see Jed Leland.

718
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,040
Of course, he and Mr. Kane
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

719
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,920
You take the Spanish-American war.

720
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,240
I guess Mr. Leland was right.
That was Mr. Kane's war.

721
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,880
We didn't really have anything
to fight about.

722
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,440
Do you think if it hadn't been for that war
of Mr. Kane's...

723
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,640
...we'd have the Panama Canal?

724
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,400
I wish I knew where Mr. Leland was.

725
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,040
A lot of the time now
they don't tell me these things.

726
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,760
Maybe even he's dead.

727
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,640
In case you'd like to know...

728
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,840
...he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital
on 180th Street.

729
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,440
You don't say. I had--

730
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,800
Nothing particular the matter with him,
they tell me, just....

731
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,480
Just old age.

732
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,720
It's the only disease that you don't
look forward to being cured of.

733
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,760
I can remember absolutely everything,
young man.

734
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,240
That's my curse.

735
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,400
That's one of the greatest curses
ever inflicted on the human race: memory.

736
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,640
I was his oldest friend, and as far as
I was concerned, he behaved like a swine.

737
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,920
Not that Charlie was ever brutal.
He just did brutal things.

738
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,080
Maybe I wasn't his friend,
but if I wasn't, he never had one.

739
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,480
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

740
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,280
You were about to say something
about Rosebud.

741
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,120
Do you happen to have a good cigar?

742
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,720
I've got a young physician here
who thinks I'm going to give up smoking.

743
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,240
No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sorry.

744
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,600
I changed the subject, didn't l?

745
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,360
What a disagreeable old man
I have become.

746
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,640
You're a reporter and you want to know
what I think about Charlie Kane.

747
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,440
I suppose he had some private sort
of greatness.

748
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,680
But he kept it to himself.

749
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,840
He never gave himself away.
He never gave anything away.

750
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,880
He just left you a tip.

751
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,320
He had a generous mind.

752
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,040
I don't suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions.

753
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,600
But he never believed in anything
except Charlie Kane.

754
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,480
He never had a conviction
except Charlie Kane in his life.

755
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,120
I suppose he died without one.

756
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,480
That must have been pretty unpleasant.

757
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,480
Of course, a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death.

758
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,120
But we do know what we're leaving.
We do believe in something.

759
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,920
Are you absolutely sure
you haven't got a cigar?

760
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,920
-Sorry, Mr. Leland.
-Never mind.

761
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,480
-What do you know about Rosebud?
-"Rosebud"?

762
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,080
His dying words: "Rosebud."

763
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,040
I saw that in the Inquirer.

764
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,880
I never believed anything
I saw in the Inquirer.

765
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,400
Anything else?

766
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,560
I can tell you about Emily.
I went to dancing school with Emily.

767
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,680
I was very graceful.

768
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,240
-We were talking about the first Mrs. Kane.
-What was she like?

769
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,400
She was like all the girls I knew
in dancing school.

770
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,920
Very nice girl. Emily was a little nicer.

771
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
After the first couple of months...

772
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,160
...she and Charlie didn't see much
of each other except at breakfast.

773
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,520
It was a marriage
just like any other marriage.

774
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,640
-You're beautiful.
-l can't be.

775
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,680
Yes, you are. You're very beautiful.

776
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,440
I've never been to six parties
in one night before.

777
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,640
-I've never been up this late.
-It's a matter of habit.

778
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,840
-What will the servants think?
-That we enjoyed ourselves.

779
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,400
Why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper?

780
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,560
You never should've married a
newspaperman, they're worse than sailors.

781
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,840
I absolutely adore you.

782
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,800
Charles, even newspapermen
have to sleep.

783
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,280
I'll call Mr. Bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon.

784
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,040
What time is it?

785
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,560
I don't know. It's late.

786
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,880
It's early.

787
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,640
Charles....

788
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,880
Do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night...

789
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,720
...when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes?

790
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,040
What do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night?

791
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,800
My dear, your only correspondent
is the Inquirer.

792
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,720
Sometimes I think I'd prefer a rival
of flesh and blood.

793
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,480
I don't spend that much time
on the newspaper.

794
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,960
It isn't just the time.
It's what you print, attacking the President.

795
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,120
-You mean Uncle John.
-l mean the President of the United States.

796
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,360
He's still Uncle John
and a well-meaning fathead...

797
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,280
...who's letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration.

798
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,640
-This whole oil scandal--
-He happens to be the President, not you.

799
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,720
That's a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days.

800
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,040
Your Mr. Bernstein sent Junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday.

801
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,560
I simply can't have it in the nursery.

802
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,160
Mr. Bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then.

803
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,520
Does he have to?

804
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Yes.

805
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,240
-Really, Charles, people will think--
-What I tell them to think.

806
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,960
Wasn't he ever in love with her?

807
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,680
He married for love.

808
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,320
Love.

809
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,640
That is why he did everything.

810
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,840
That's why he went into politics.
It seems we weren't enough.

811
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,920
He wanted all the voters to love him, too.

812
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,400
All he wanted out of life was love.

813
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,080
That's Charlie's story. How he lost it.

814
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,080
You see, he just didn't have any to give.

815
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,680
He loved Charlie Kane, of course.

816
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,360
Very dearly.

817
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,120
And his mother,
I guess he always loved her.

818
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,920
-How about his second wife?
-Susan Alexander?

819
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,080
You know what Charlie called her?

820
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,640
The day after he'd met her,
he told me about her.

821
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,720
He said she was
"a cross-section of the American public."

822
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,480
I guess he couldn't help it.
She must have had something for him.

823
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,640
That first night, according to Charlie...

824
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,240
...all she had was a toothache.

825
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,440
What are you laughing at, young lady?

826
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,640
-What's the matter with you?
-Toothache.

827
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,680
-What?
-Toothache.

828
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,280
Toothache?

829
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,960
You mean you've got a toothache.

830
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,760
-What's funny about that?
-You're funny, mister.

831
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,480
-You've got dirt on your face.
-Not dirt, it's mud.

832
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,200
Do you want some hot water?
I live right here.

833
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,880
What's that, young lady?

834
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,360
I said, if you wanted some hot water...

835
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
...l could get you some...hot water.

836
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,240
All right, thank you very much.

837
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,880
Do I look any better now?

838
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,560
-This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.
-What you need is to get your mind off it.

839
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Excuse me, but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open...

840
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,880
-...when I have a gentleman caller.
-All right.

841
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,040
You have got a toothache, haven't you?

842
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,960
-l surely have.
-Why don't you try laughing at me again?

843
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,880
-What?
-I'm still pretty funny.

844
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,520
I know, but you don't want me
to laugh at you.

845
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.

846
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,240
Look at me.

847
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,080
See that?

848
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,280
What are you doing?

849
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,360
I'm wiggling both my ears
at the same time.

850
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,720
That's it, smile.

851
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,680
It took me two solid years at the best
boys' school in the world to learn that.

852
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,080
The fellow who taught me
is now president of Venezuela.

853
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,360
That's it!

854
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,480
-Is it a giraffe?
-No, not a giraffe.

855
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,800
-l bet it is.
-What?

856
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,040
Well, then it's an elephant.

857
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,560
-It's supposed to be a rooster.
-A rooster!

858
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,680
You know an awful lot of tricks.
Are you a professional magician?

859
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,480
-No, I'm not a magician.
-l was just joking.

860
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,600
You really don't know who I am?

861
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You told me your name, Mr. Kane,
but I'm awfully ignorant.

862
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,320
I guess you caught on to that.
I bet I've heard your name a million times.

863
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You really like me, though,
even though you don't know who I am?

864
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,320
I surely do. You've been wonderful.

865
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,640
Without you I don't know
what I would have done.

866
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,200
I had a toothache,
and I don't know many people.

867
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,800
I know too many people.

868
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,920
I guess we're both lonely.

869
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,800
Want to know what I was going to do
before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?

870
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,160
I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.
You probably have more.

871
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,160
I was just joking.

872
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,760
I was on my way
to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...

873
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,920
...in search of my youth.

874
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,440
You see, my mother died a long time ago.
Her things were put in storage out West.

875
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,360
There wasn't any other place to put them.

876
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,880
I thought I'd send for them now.
Tonight I was going to take a look at them.

877
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,120
A sort of sentimental journey.

878
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,240
I run a couple of newspapers.
What do you do?

879
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,960
Me?

880
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,120
-How old did you say you were?
-l didn't say.

881
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,600
If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.

882
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,200
-How old?
-Pretty old.

883
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
-How old?
-Twenty-two in August.

884
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,920
That's a ripe old age. What do you do?

885
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,320
I work at Seligman's.
I'm in charge of the sheet music.

886
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,400
-Is that what you want to do?
-No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.

887
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,440
-That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.
-What happened to the singing?

888
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,840
Mother always thought, she always talked
about grand opera for me.

889
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,160
Imagine.

890
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,040
But my voice isn't that kind.
It's just, you know what mothers are like.

891
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,160
Yes.

892
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,680
-Have you got a piano?
-A piano?

893
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,720
Yes, there's one in the parlor.

894
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,920
-Would you sing for me?
-You wouldn't want to hear me sing.

895
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,320
Yes, I would.

896
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,160
Don't tell me
your toothache is bothering you.

897
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,640
No, that's all gone.

898
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,880
All right.

899
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,720
Let's go to the parlor.

900
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,600
"Yes, Lindor shall be mine

901
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,400
"l have sworn it

902
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,720
"For weal or woe

903
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,640
"Yes, Lindor

904
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,160
"Lo giurai

905
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,760
"La vincer"

906
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,400
There is only one man
who can rid the politics...

907
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,160
...of this state of the evil domination
of Boss Jim Gettys.

908
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,760
I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,
the fighting liberal...

909
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,440
...the friend of the workingman,
the next governor of this state...

910
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,200
...who entered upon this campaign....

911
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,920
...with one purpose only:

912
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,200
To point out
and make public the dishonesty...

913
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,600
...the downright villainy
of Boss Jim W. Gettys' political machine...

914
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,160
...now in complete control
of the government of this state.

915
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,640
I made no campaign promises...

916
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,440
...because, until a few weeks ago,
I had no hope of being elected.

917
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Now, however, l have something more
than a hope.

918
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,400
Jim Gettys has something less
than a chance.

919
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,840
Every straw vote...

920
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,640
...every independent poll shows
that l will be elected.

921
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,640
Very well.

922
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,640
Now l can afford to make some promises.

923
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,080
The workingman and the slum child...

924
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,960
...know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests.

925
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,360
The decent, ordinary citizens know
that I'll do everything in my power...

926
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
...to protect the underprivileged,
the underpaid, and the underfed.

927
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,200
-Mother, is Pop governor yet?
-Not yet, Junior.

928
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,240
I'd make my promises now...

929
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,320
...if I weren't too busy
arranging to keep them.

930
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,880
But here's one promise I'll make...

931
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,920
...and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.

932
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,720
My first official act
as governor of this state...

933
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,680
...will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment...

934
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,480
...prosecution and conviction
of Boss Jim W. Gettys.

935
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,080
If the election were held today,
you'd be in by 100,000 votes.

936
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,800
-Gettys isn't even pretending.
-Pop.

937
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,040
-Hello, son.
-He isn't just scared, he's sick.

938
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,720
It's beginning to dawn on Jim Gettys
I mean what I say.

939
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,240
-Did you like your old man's speech?
-l could hear every word.

940
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,600
-Hello, Emily.
-Hold it.

941
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,560
-Great speech, Mr. Kane.
-Wonderful.

942
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,240
Will you get us a taxi?

943
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,800
I'm sending Junior home
in the car with Oliver.

944
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,560
Good night, Father.

945
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,800
Goodbye, son.

946
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,320
Why did you send Junior home in the car?
What are you doing in a taxi?

947
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,080
There's a call I want you to make with me.

948
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,840
-It can wait.
-No, it can't.

949
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,600
What's this all about, Emily?

950
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,120
It may not be about anything at all.
I intend to find out.

951
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,920
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to "185 West 74th Street."

952
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,800
If you wish, you may come with me.

953
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,480
I'll come with you.

954
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,320
I had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama, Emily.

955
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,920
Come right in, Mr. Kane.

956
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,320
Charlie.

957
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,960
He forced me to send your wife that letter.
I didn't want to.

958
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,680
He's been saying the most terrible....

959
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,600
Mrs. Kane.

960
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,400
I don't suppose
anybody would introduce us.

961
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,520
I'm Jim Gettys.

962
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,120
Yes?

963
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,600
I made Miss Alexander send you the note,
Mrs. Kane.

964
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,200
She didn't want to at first. But she did it.

965
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,720
Charlie, the things he said to me....
He threatened to--

966
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,680
I won't wait until I'm elected.
To start with, I think I'll break your neck.

967
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,640
Maybe you can do it, and maybe you can't.

968
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,960
Your breaking this man's neck
would scarcely explain this note:

969
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,680
"Serious consequences for Mr. Kane,
for yourself and for your son."

970
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,920
-He wanted to get her to come here--
-What does this note mean?

971
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,520
I'm Susan Alexander.
I know what you're thinking--

972
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,720
-What does this note mean, Ms. Alexander?
-She don't know.

973
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,720
She sent it because I told her
it wouldn't be smart not to.

974
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,160
-Emily, this gentleman--
-I'm not a gentleman.

975
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,760
Your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one.

976
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,480
I don't even know what a gentleman is.

977
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,120
You see, my idea of a gentleman....

978
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,320
If I owned a paper and didn't like
the way somebody was doing things...

979
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,360
...some politician,
I'd fight him with all I had.

980
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,760
I wouldn't show him in a convict suit...

981
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,280
...so his family could see his picture
in the paper.

982
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,800
-You're a cheap, crooked grafter--
-We're talking now about what you are.

983
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,720
I'm fighting for my life,
not just my political life.

984
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,080
-He said unless you--
-That's what I said.

985
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,840
Here's the chance I'm willing to give him.
It's more of a chance than he'd give me.

986
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,560
Unless he decides by tomorrow that
he's so sick he has to go away for a year...

987
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,120
...Monday morning, all papers in the state,
except his, will carry the story I'll give.

988
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,320
What story?

989
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,040
-The story about him and Ms. Alexander.
-There isn't any story!

990
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,160
Shut up.

991
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,720
We've got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines.

992
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,560
Do you want me to give you the evidence?

993
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,720
I'd rather he withdrew
without having the story published.

994
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,960
Not that I care about him,
but I'd be better off that way.

995
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So would you, Mrs. Kane.

996
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
What about me?

997
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,680
He said my name would be dragged
through the mud. That everywhere I went--

998
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,760
There seems to be only one decision
you can make, Charles.

999
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,080
I'd say that it'd been made for you.

1000
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You can't tell me the voters of this state--

1001
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,680
I'm not interested in the voters
of this state right now.

1002
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,440
I am interested in our son.

1003
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,040
-Charlie, if they publish this story--
-They won't.

1004
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,040
Good night, Mr. Gettys.

1005
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Are you coming, Charles?

1006
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,280
No.

1007
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,560
I'm staying here.

1008
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I can fight this all alone.

1009
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,400
If you don't listen to reason,
it may be too late.

1010
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,800
Too late? For what?

1011
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,160
For you and this public thief...

1012
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,240
...to take the love of the people
away from me?

1013
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,680
You got other things to think about.
Your little boy.

1014
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,360
You don't want him to read about you
in the papers.

1015
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,320
There's only one person in the world
to decide what I'll do. And that's me.

1016
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,400
You decided what you were going to do,
Charles, some time ago.

1017
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,560
You're making a bigger fool of yourself
than I thought.

1018
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,280
-I've got nothing to say to you.
-You're licked--

1019
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,240
Get out. If you want to see me,
have the warden write me a letter.

1020
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,480
If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you.

1021
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,600
Only you're going to need
more than one lesson.

1022
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,880
-And you'll get more than one lesson.
-Don't worry about me, Gettys.

1023
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,960
Don't worry about me!

1024
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,480
I'm Charles Foster Kane!

1025
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,120
I'm no cheap, crooked politician
trying to save himself...

1026
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,920
...from the consequences of his crimes!

1027
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,840
Gettys! I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing.

1028
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,040
Sing Sing, Gettys.

1029
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,960
-Have you a car, Mrs. Kane?
-Yes, thank you.

1030
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,640
-Good night.
-Good night.

1031
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,800
Paper. Read all about it. Extra, extra.

1032
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
-Paper?
-No, thanks.

1033
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,720
With a million majority
already against him...

1034
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,200
...and the church counties
still to be heard from...

1035
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,320
...I'm afraid we got no choice.

1036
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,360
This one?

1037
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,680
That one.

1038
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,760
Good night again.

1039
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,320
-Is there anything I can--
-No, thanks, Mr. Bernstein.

1040
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,200
You better go home and get some sleep.

1041
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,400
You, too.

1042
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,720
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1043
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,440
-Hello, Jedediah.
-I'm drunk.

1044
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,920
If you've got drunk to talk to me about...

1045
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,440
...Ms. Alexander, don't bother.

1046
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,720
I'm not interested.

1047
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,720
I've set back the sacred cause of reform,
is that it?

1048
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,360
All right.

1049
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,160
If that's the way they want it,
the people have made their choice.

1050
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,680
It's obvious the people prefer
Jim Gettys to me.

1051
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,520
You talk about the people
as though you owned them.

1052
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,200
As though they belong to you. Goodness.

1053
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,600
As long as I can remember, you've talked
about giving the people their rights...

1054
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,120
...as if you could make them
a present of liberty...

1055
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,440
...as a reward for services rendered.

1056
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,320
-Jed.
-You remember the workingman?

1057
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,520
I'll get drunk, too, Jedediah...

1058
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,200
...if it'll do any good.

1059
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,280
It won't do any good.
Besides you never get drunk.

1060
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,720
You used to write an awful lot
about the workingman--

1061
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,880
Go on home.

1062
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,760
He's turning into something called
"organized labor."

1063
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,200
You won't like that one little bit
when you find out...

1064
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,920
...it means your workingman expects
something as his right, and not your gift.

1065
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,320
When your precious underprivileged
really get together....

1066
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,760
Oh, boy....

1067
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,840
That'll add up to something
bigger than your privilege...

1068
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,840
...then I don't know what you'll do.

1069
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,080
Sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys.

1070
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,080
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1071
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,680
There'll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when I do something wrong.

1072
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
You may not always be so lucky.

1073
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,400
You're not very drunk.

1074
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,960
Drunk, what do you care?

1075
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,760
You don't care about anything except you.

1076
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,600
You persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back.

1077
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,520
Only you want love on your own terms.

1078
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,320
It's something to be played your way,
according to your rules.

1079
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,080
-Let me work on the Chicago paper.
-What?

1080
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,600
You said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic "crimitism," criticism.

1081
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,640
I am drunk.

1082
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,920
I want to go to Chicago.

1083
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,680
You're too valuable here.

1084
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,800
-There's nothing left for me to do--
-All right, you can go to Chicago.

1085
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,200
Thank you.

1086
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,440
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway.

1087
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,400
I warn you, Jedediah,
you won't like Chicago.

1088
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,440
The wind comes off the lake, and they've
probably never heard of Lobster Newburg.

1089
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,120
Will Saturday after next be all right?

1090
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,880
-Anytime you say.
-Thank you.

1091
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,760
A toast to love on my terms.
Those are the only terms anybody knows:

1092
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,160
His own.

1093
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,440
Mr. Kane, I'm from the Inquirer.

1094
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,800
-What's that, young man?
-Are you through with politics?

1095
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,600
Am I through with politics?
I would say vice versa.

1096
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,640
We're going to be an opera star.

1097
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,800
Are you singing at the Metropolitan?

1098
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,320
We certainly are.

1099
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,760
Charlie said if I didn't,
he'd build me an opera house.

1100
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,440
That won't be necessary.

1101
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,160
No, no, no!

1102
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,440
Places, please!

1103
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,680
Mr. Leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle?

1104
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,320
-And we've covered it from the news end.
-And the social.

1105
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,120
How about the music notice?

1106
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,920
Yes, it's already made up.

1107
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,560
Mr. Mowan wrote a swell review.

1108
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
-Enthusiastic?
-Yes, sir.

1109
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,520
Mr. Kane. This is a surprise.

1110
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,920
We've got two spreads of pictures.

1111
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,800
The music notice on the front page?

1112
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,520
But there's still one notice to come.
The dramatic.

1113
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,480
The dramatic notice.

1114
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,360
-Mr. Bernstein, that's Mr. Leland, isn't it?
-Yes, we're waiting for it.

1115
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,960
-Where is he?
-Right in there, Mr. Kane.

1116
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,440
Mr. Kane.

1117
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,560
Mr. Leland and Mr. Kane...

1118
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,120
...haven't spoken together for years.

1119
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,560
-You don't suppose--
-There's nothing to suppose.

1120
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,240
Excuse me.

1121
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,440
Close the door.

1122
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,440
He ain't been drinking before.

1123
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Never. We would have heard.

1124
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,880
What does it say there?

1125
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,560
The notice, what's he written?

1126
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,760
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur...

1127
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,680
"...last night opened
the new Chicago Opera House...

1128
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,680
"...in a performance of...."

1129
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,400
I still can't pronounce that name.

1130
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,800
"Her singing, happily,
is no concern of this department.

1131
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,760
"Of her acting,
it is absolutely impossible to...."

1132
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,120
Go on.

1133
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,920
That's all there is.

1134
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,400
Of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except...

1135
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,440
...that, in the opinion of this reviewer,
it represents a new low.

1136
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,800
-In the opinion of this reviewer.
-l didn't see that.

1137
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,240
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein, I'm dictating it.

1138
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,800
-Mr. Kane, l--
-Get me a typewriter.

1139
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,280
I'm going to finish Mr. Leland's notice.

1140
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,840
Hello, Bernstein.

1141
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,200
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Leland.

1142
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,080
Where's my notice, Bernstein?
I've got to finish my notice.

1143
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,120
-Mr. Kane is finishing it for you.
-Charlie?

1144
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,240
Charlie out there?

1145
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,360
I guess he's fixing it up.

1146
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,320
I knew I'd never get that through.

1147
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,840
Mr. Kane's finishing your review
just the way you started it.

1148
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,560
He's writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be.

1149
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,920
I guess that'll show you.

1150
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,840
Hello, Jedediah.

1151
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,400
Hello, Charlie.

1152
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,720
I didn't know we were speaking.

1153
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,160
Sure we're speaking, Jedediah.

1154
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,080
You're fired.

1155
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,360
Everybody knows that story, Mr. Leland,
but why did he do it?

1156
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,040
-How could a man write a notice--
-You just don't know Charlie.

1157
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,760
He thought that by finishing that notice
he'd show me he was an honest man.

1158
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,160
He was always trying to prove something.

1159
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
That whole thing about Susie
being an opera singer.

1160
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,160
That was trying to prove something.

1161
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,200
You know what the headline was
the day before the election?

1162
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,760
"Candidate Kane found
in love nest with 'singer."'

1163
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,040
He was going to take
the quotes off the singer.

1164
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,080
Hey, nurse!

1165
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,840
Five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the South.

1166
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:15,360
What's it called, Shangri-la? EI Dorado?
Sloppy Joe's? What's the name?

1167
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,160
All right, Xanadu, I knew it all the time.

1168
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,960
You caught on, didn't you?
I'm not that hard to see through.

1169
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,280
Well, I never even answered his letter.

1170
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,320
Maybe I should have.

1171
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,880
I guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years.

1172
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,960
He hadn't finished it when she left him.
He never finished it.

1173
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,080
He never finished anything
except my notice.

1174
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,040
-Of course, he built the joint for her.
-That must have been love.

1175
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,920
I don't know.

1176
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,320
He was disappointed in the world
so he built his own, an absolute monarchy.

1177
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,480
It was something bigger
than an opera house anyway.

1178
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,320
-Nurse.
-Yes, Mr. Leland.

1179
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,320
I'm coming.

1180
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,360
-There's one thing you can do for me.
-Sure.

1181
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,440
Stop at the cigar store on your way out,
and get me a couple of good cigars.

1182
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
-Be glad to.
-Thank you.

1183
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,360
One is enough.

1184
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,240
When I was a young man, there was
an impression that nurses were pretty.

1185
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Well, it was no truer then than it is today.

1186
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,040
-I'll take your arm.
-All right.

1187
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,600
-You won't forget about those cigars?
-l won't.

1188
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,760
Have them wrapped like toothpaste,
or they'll stop them at the desk.

1189
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,800
You know that young doctor
I was telling you about, well...

1190
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,720
...he's got an idea
he wants to keep me alive.

1191
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,840
I'd rather you'd just talk.
Anything that comes into your mind...

1192
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,120
...about yourself and Mr. Kane.

1193
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:11,120
You don't want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and Charlie Kane.

1194
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,600
You know, maybe I shouldn't have sung
for Charlie that first time I met him.

1195
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,800
But I did an awful lot of singing after that.

1196
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,720
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour.

1197
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,480
-The teachers got that, I didn't.
-What did you get?

1198
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,440
I didn't get a thing, except music lessons.
That's all there was in it.

1199
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,440
He married you, didn't he?

1200
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,320
He didn't mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and...

1201
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,240
...until it got in the papers about us...

1202
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,680
...and he lost the election,
and that Norton woman divorced him.

1203
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,960
He was really interested in my voice.

1204
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,520
Why did he build that opera house?

1205
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,680
I didn't want it. I didn't want a thing.
It was his idea.

1206
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Everything was his idea...

1207
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,920
...except my leaving him.

1208
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,480
"Don't forget"

1209
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,440
Don't get nervous.

1210
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,560
Please. Let's come back.

1211
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,080
Look at me, Mrs. Kane, darling.

1212
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:30,560
"Get the voice out of the throat
Place the tone right in the mask

1213
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,280
"Diaphragm"

1214
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,200
You're out of pitch.

1215
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,960
Some people can sing. Some can't.

1216
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,480
Impossible.

1217
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,960
It's not your job to give your opinion
of Mrs. Kane's talents.

1218
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,440
You're supposed to train her voice,
Signor Matiste. Nothing more.

1219
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,720
Please continue with the lesson.

1220
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,360
-But, Mr. Kane.
-Please.

1221
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,720
I'll be the laughingstock
of the musical world. People will think--

1222
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,840
You're concerned what people will think?

1223
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,400
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit.
I'm an authority on what people will think.

1224
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,720
The newspapers for example.

1225
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,640
I run several newspapers
between here and San Francisco.

1226
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,400
It's all right, darling.

1227
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,160
Signor Matiste is going to listen to reason.

1228
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,640
-How can I persuade you--
-You can't.

1229
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,040
It's all right, darling, go ahead.

1230
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,640
I thought you'd see it my way.

1231
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,760
No, no, no.

1232
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,360
"Ah, cruel

1233
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,320
"Tu m'as trop entendue

1234
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,360
"Les Dieux m'en sont tmoins

1235
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,240
"Ces Dieux qui dans mon flanc

1236
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,200
"Ont allum

1237
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,600

01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,920
"A tout mon sang

01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,760

"Oh Dieux, arrachez-moi

1244
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,320
"Ces feux fatals"

1245
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,040
I think it's dreadful.

1246
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,360
"Allument ma mort

1247
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,520

01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,640

1253
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,280
"Frappe"

1254
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,320
Stop telling me he's your friend.

1255
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,320
A friend don't write that kind of review.

1256
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,280
All these other papers panning me,
I could expect that.

1257
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,640
But for the Inquirer to run a thing like that,
spoiling my whole debut.

1258
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,760
Come in.

1259
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,920
I'll get it.

1260
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,720
Friend. Not the kind of friends I know...

1261
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,920
...but I'm not high class like you.

1262
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,960
And I never went to any swell schools.

1263
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,400
That'll be enough, Susan.

1264
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,200
From Mr. Leland, sir.

1265
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
He wanted me to make sure
you got this personally.

1266
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,520
Is that something from him?

1267
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,160
Charlie!

1268
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,680
As for you,
you ought to have your head examined.

1269
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,480
Sending him a letter telling him he's fired...

1270
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,400
...with a $25,000 check in it.

1271
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,440
What kind of firing do you call that?

1272
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,080
You did send him a check for $25,000,
didn't you?

1273
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,960
Yes.

1274
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,080
I sent him a check for $25,000.

1275
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,400
What's that?

1276
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,440
Declaration of Principles.

1277
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,040
What?

1278
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,040
What is it?

1279
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:57,960
An antique.

1280
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,640
You're awful funny, aren't you?

1281
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,120
I'll tell you one thing you're not going
to be funny about, and that's my singing.

1282
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,080
I'm through.

1283
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,400
I never wanted to do it in the first place.

1284
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,400
You'll continue with your singing, Susan.

1285
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,680
I don't propose
to have myself made ridiculous.

1286
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,160
You don't propose
to have yourself made ridiculous!

1287
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,200
What about me?
I'm the one that has to sing.

1288
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,880
I'm the one that gets the raspberries.

1289
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,760
Why don't you leave me alone?

1290
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,640
My reasons satisfy me, Susan.

1291
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,040
You seem unable to understand them.

1292
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,160
I will not tell them to you again.

1293
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,080
You'll continue with your singing.

1294
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,760
Get Dr. Corey.

1295
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,040
Susan.

1296
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,480
She'll be perfectly all right
in a day or two, Mr. Kane.

1297
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,880
I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane
came to make such a foolish mistake.

1298
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,400
The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle.

1299
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,280
The strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her.

1300
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,160
Yes, I'm sure that was it.

1301
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,640
No objections to my staying
with her are there?

1302
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,920
No, not at all.
I'd like the nurse to be here, too.

1303
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,040
Good night, Mr. Kane.

1304
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,560
Charlie.

1305
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,560
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.

1306
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,640
But I couldn't go through
with the singing again.

1307
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,080
You don't know what it means
to know that people....

1308
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,680
That the whole audience doesn't want you.

1309
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
That's when you got to fight them.

1310
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,480
All right.

1311
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,320
You won't have to fight them anymore.

1312
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,040
It's their loss.

1313
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,680
What are you doing?

1314
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,920
Jigsaw puzzles?

1315
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,920
Charlie, what time is it?

1316
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,440
11:30

1317
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,360
In New York?

1318
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,720
I said what time is it in New York?

1319
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
-1 1 :30.
-Night?

1320
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,760
The Bulldog's just gone to press.

1321
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,080
Well, hurray for the Bulldog.

1322
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,640
Gee, 11:30. Shows are just getting up.

1323
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,640
People are going to nightclubs
and restaurants.

1324
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,240
Of course, we're different
because we live in a palace.

1325
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,520
You always said you wanted
to live in a palace.

1326
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,280
A person could go crazy in this dump.

1327
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,680
Nobody to talk to,
nobody to have any fun with.

1328
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,720
49,000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues.

1329
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,440
I'm lonesome.

1330
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,800
Until yesterday, we've had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time.

1331
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,640
I think if you look in the west wing...

1332
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
...you'll probably find a dozen vacationists
still in residence.

1333
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,520
You make a joke out of everything.

1334
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,440
Charlie, I want to go to New York.
I'm tired of being a hostess.

1335
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,680
I want to have fun. Please, Charlie.

1336
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,720
Charlie, please.

1337
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,520
Our home is here, Susan.

1338
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,160
I don't care to visit New York.

1339
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,720
What are you doing?

1340
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,160
One thing I can never understand:

1341
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,080
How do you know
you haven't done it before?

1342
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,840
It makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues.

1343
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,520
You may be right.

1344
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I sometimes wonder...

1345
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,320
...but you get into the habit.

1346
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,760
It's not a habit, I do it because I like it.

1347
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,480
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1348
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,920
Invite everybody to spend the night
at the Everglades.

1349
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,200
Invite everybody. Order everybody,
you mean, and make them sleep in tents.

1350
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,880
Who wants to sleep in tents
when they've got their own room...

1351
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,520
...with a bath, where they know
where everything is?

1352
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,280
I thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow.

1353
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,160
You never give me anything
I really care about.

1354
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,800
"It can't be love

1355
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,440
"For there is no true love

1356
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,400
"l know I've played at the game

1357
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,760
"Like a moth in a blue flame

1358
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,680
"Lost in the end, just the same

1359
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,400
"All these years

1360
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,680
"My heart's been floating around
in a puddle of tears

1361
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,880
"l wonder what it is"

1362
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,880
Sure, you give me things,
but that don't mean anything to you.

1363
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,960
You're in a tent, darling,
you're not at home.

1364
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,240
I can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice.

1365
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,800
What's the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $100,000...

1366
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,920
...for a statue you'll keep crated up
and never look at?

1367
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,280
It's just money. It doesn't mean anything.

1368
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,080
You never really gave me anything
that you care about.

1369
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,720
I want you to stop this.

1370
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,360
I'm not going to stop it.

1371
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,200
You never gave me anything in your life.

1372
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,160
You just tried to buy me
into giving you something.

1373
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,760
"It can't be love"

1374
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,480
Whatever I do, I do because I love you.

1375
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,880
You don't love me.

1376
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,880
You want me to love you.

1377
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,840
Sure. "I'm Charles Foster Kane.

1378
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,520
"Whatever you want,
just name it and it's yours.

1379
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,160
"But you gotta love me."

1380
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,600
Don't tell me you're sorry.

1381
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,680
I'm not sorry.

1382
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,520
Mr. Kane?

1383
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,640
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, sir.

1384
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,040
Marie has been packing for her
since morning.

1385
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,560
Tell Arnold I'm ready, Marie.
Tell him he can get the bags.

1386
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,200
Yes, madame.

1387
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,280
Have you gone completely crazy?

1388
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,120
Don't you know that our guests,
that everyone will know about this?

1389
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,760
Packed your bag, sent for the car--

1390
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And left you?

1391
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,840
Of course they'll hear.

1392
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,560
I'm not saying goodbye, except to you.

1393
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,720
But I never imagined
people wouldn't know.

1394
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,800
I won't let you go.

1395
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,560
Goodbye, Charlie.

1396
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,360
Susan.

1397
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,560
Please don't go.

1398
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,720
Please, Susan.

1399
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,320
From now on, everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be.

1400
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,040
Not the way I think you want it, but...

1401
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,440
...your way.

1402
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,280
You mustn't go.

1403
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,040
You can't do this to me.

1404
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,600
I see.

1405
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,440
It's you that this is being done to.

1406
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,720
It's not me at all.

1407
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,840
Not what it means to me.

1408
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,080
I can't do this to you?

1409
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,880
Oh, yes, I can.

1410
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
In case you haven't heard,
I lost all my money and it was plenty.

1411
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,200
The last 10 years
have been difficult for many.

1412
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,840
They haven't been tough on me.
I just lost all my money.

1413
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,040
-You're going down to Xanadu?
-Monday, with boys from the office.

1414
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,680
Mr. Rawlston wants
the whole place photographed.

1415
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,560
We run a picture magazine.

1416
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,600
If you're smart, you'll get in touch
with Raymond. He's the butler.

1417
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,880
You'll learn a lot from him.

1418
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,400
He knows where all the bodies are buried.

1419
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,080
You know, all the same,
I feel kind of sorry for Mr. Kane.

1420
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,600
Don't you think I do?

1421
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,840
What do you know, it's morning already.

1422
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,480
Come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime.

1423
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,520
Rosebud?

1424
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I'll tell you about Rosebud.

1425
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,840
How much is it worth to you?

1426
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,720
$1,000?

1427
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,600
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Thompson.

1428
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,280
-He acted funny sometimes, you know?
-No, I didn't.

1429
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,320
Yes, he did crazy things sometimes.

1430
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,320
I've been working for him 11 years now...

1431
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,640
...in charge of the whole place,
so I ought to know.

1432
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,240
-Rosebud.
-Yes.

1433
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,800
Like I tell you, the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes...

1434
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,560
-...but I knew how to handle him--
-Need a lot of service?

1435
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,920
But I knew how to handle him.

1436
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,640
Like that time his wife left.

1437
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,200
Rosebud.

1438
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,480
I see.

1439
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,360
And that's what you know about Rosebud?

1440
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,280
I heard him say it that other time, too.

1441
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,840
He just said:

1442
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,760
"Rosebud."

1443
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,160
Then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor.

1444
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,040
He didn't say anything after that,
and I knew he was dead.

1445
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,600
He said all kinds of things
that didn't mean anything.

1446
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,920
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1447
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,560
-Yes and no.
-That isn't worth $1,000.

1448
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,880
You can keep on asking questions
if you want to.

1449
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,600
We're leaving tonight...

1450
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,880
...when we're through taking pictures.

1451
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,880
Allow yourself plenty of time.

1452
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,720
The train stops at the junction on signal,
but they don't like to wait.

1453
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,840
I can remember when they'd wait all day...

1454
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,640
...if Mr. Kane said so.

1455
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,480
Better get going.

1456
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,760
-Can we come down?
-Yes, hurry up. We're leaving.

1457
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,320
How much do you think
this is all worth, Mr. Thompson?

1458
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,480
Millions.

1459
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,160
If anybody wants it.

1460
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,560
Well, at least he brought all this stuff
to America.

1461
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,680
-What's that?
-Another Venus.

1462
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,280
$25,000.

1463
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,480
A lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head.

1464
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,080
The banks are out of luck?

1465
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,640
-They'll clear all right.
-He never threw anything away.

1466
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,960
"Welcome home, Mr. Kane, from 467
employees of the New York Inquirer."

1467
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,160
"One stove from the estate of Mary Kane,
Little Salem, Colorado. Value: $2."

1468
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,640
A regular crow, eh?

1469
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,600
-Hey, look, a jigsaw puzzle.
-We got a lot of those.

1470
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,920
A Burmese temple and three
Spanish ceilings down the hall.

1471
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,400
Part of a Scotch castle...

1472
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,720
...that needs to be unwrapped.

1473
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,400
Put all this stuff together:

1474
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
The palaces and the paintings,
and the toys and everything.

1475
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,920
What would it spell?

1476
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,680
-Charles Foster Kane?
-Or Rosebud.

1477
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,120
-How about it, Jerry?
-What's Rosebud?

1478
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,160
That's what he said when he died.

1479
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,080
Did you ever find out what it means?

1480
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,160
-No, I didn't.
-What did you find out about him?

1481
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,400
Not much, really.

1482
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,640
We'd better get started.

1483
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,320
What have you been doing all this time?

1484
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,560
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle.

1485
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,640
If you'd discovered what Rosebud meant,
I bet it would've explained everything.

1486
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,520
No, I don't think so.

1487
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,360
No.

1488
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,400
He was a man who got
everything he wanted, and then lost it.

1489
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,560
Maybe Rosebud was something
he couldn't get or something he lost.

1490
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,200
It wouldn't have explained anything.

1491
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.

1492
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,040
No. I guess Rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle.

1493
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,640
A missing piece.

1494
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,080
Come on, everybody...

1495
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,160
...we'll miss the train.

1496
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,160
Throw that junk in.

1497
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,840
Maybe I was what you nowadays
call a stooge.

1498
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,920
Everything was his idea...

1499
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,920
...except my leaving him.

1500
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,920
I've got his trunk all packed.

1501
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,080
I've had it packed for a week now.

1502
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,320
Sometimes I think I'd prefer
a rival of flesh and blood.

1503
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,400
You're gonna need more than one lesson.

1504
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,360
And you'll get more than one lesson.

1505
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,440
Who's a busy man, me?

1506
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,160
I'm chairman of the board.
I got nothing but time.

1507
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,360
What do you want to know?

1508
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,440
We thought.... If we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying....

1509
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,080
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?

1510
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,080
Yes and no.

1511
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,680
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."

1512
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,360
"l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper."
