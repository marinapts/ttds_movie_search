1
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,004
I owe everything to George Bailey.

2
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,298
Help him, dear Father.

3
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,718
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

4
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,429
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

5
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,515
Help my son George tonight.

6
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,226
He never thinks about himself, God.

7
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,061
That's why he's in trouble.

8
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,313
George is a good guy.

9
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,732
Give him a break, God.

10
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,942
I love him, dear Lord.

11
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,903
Watch over him tonight.

12
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,696
Please, God.

13
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,073
Something's the matter with Daddy.

14
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,451
Please bring Daddy back.

15
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,578
Please bring Daddy home.

16
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,872
Watch over him tonight.

17
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,541
Please bring Daddy back.

18
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,464
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

19
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,133
Looks like we'll have
to send someone down.

20
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,303
A lot of people asking for help
for a man named George Bailey.

21
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,930
George Bailey?

22
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,474
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.

23
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,435
We'll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?

24
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,854
That's why I came to see you, sir.

25
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,524
It's that clockmaker's turn again.

26
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,860
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

27
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,821
We've passed him up right along.

28
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,366
Because, you know, sir,
he's got the IQ of a rabbit.

29
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,911
Yes, but he's got
the faith of a child. Simple.

30
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,038
Joseph, send for Clarence.

31
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,709
You sent for me, sir?

32
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,838
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.

33
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,506
Splendid. Is he sick?

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,800
No, worse. He's discouraged.

35
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,469
At exactly 10:45 p. M. Earth time,

36
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,596
that man will be thinking seriously

37
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,640
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

38
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,352
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.

39
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,645
What are they wearing now?

40
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,857
You will spend that hour
getting acquainted with George Bailey.

41
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,943
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,

42
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,488
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

43
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,032
I've been waiting
for over 200 years now, sir,

44
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,659
and people are beginning to talk.

45
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,202
What's that book you've got there?

46
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,454
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

47
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,915
Clarence, you do a good job
with George Bailey

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,333
and you'll get your wings.

49
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,168
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

50
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,005
Poor George. Sit down.

51
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,214
Sit down? What are we...

52
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,008
If you're going to help a man,

53
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,427
you want to know something about him,
don't you?

54
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,012
Well, naturally, of course. I...

55
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,388
Now, keep your eyes open.

56
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,390
See the town?

57
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,143
Where? I don't see a thing.

58
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,062
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.

59
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,107
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.

60
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,568
Begin to see something?

61
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,362
Why, yes. This is amazing.

62
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,032
If you ever get your wings,
you'll see all by yourself.

63
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,867
Oh, wonderful.

64
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,661
Yay! Yippee!

65
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,747
Okay, boys, let's go.

66
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,498
Hey, who's that?

67
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,417
That's your problem. George Bailey.

68
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,585
A boy?

69
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,713
That's him when he was 12
back in 1919.

70
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,175
Something happens here
you'll have to remember later on.

71
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,594
Come on, Marty.

72
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,512
Let's go, Marty!

73
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,848
Attaboy, Marty.

74
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,351
Hee-haw!

75
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,394
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!

76
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:35,608
Here comes the scare-baby,
my kid brother Harry Bailey.

77
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,401
I'm not scared.

78
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,904
Come on, Harry.

79
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,948
Let's go, Harry!

80
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,617
Come on, Harry!

81
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,702
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!

82
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,788
Help, George, help!

83
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,997
Help!

84
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,584
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!

85
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,962
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

86
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,506
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.

87
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,092
George saved his brother's life that day,

88
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,887
but he caught a bad cold
which infected his left ear.

89
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,515
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

90
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,892
It was weeks
before he was able to go back

91
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,354
to his after-school job
at old man Gower's drugstore.

92
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,231
Mr. Potter.

93
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,608
Who's that, a king?

94
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,610
That's Henry F. Potter,

95
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:23,072
the richest and meanest man
in the county.

96
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,578
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

97
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,998
Go to work, slave.

98
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,209
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

99
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,629
Wish I had a million dollars.

100
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,506
Hot dog!

101
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,303
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

102
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,346
You're late.

103
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,764
Yes, sir.

104
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,399
Hello, George.

105
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,026
Hello, Mary.

106
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,694
Hello, Violet.

107
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,362
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?

108
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,780
She was here first.

109
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,699
I'm still thinking.

110
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,867
Shoelaces?

111
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,535
Please, Georgie.

112
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,203
I like him.

113
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,039
You like every boy.

114
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,749
What's wrong with that?

115
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,333
Here you are.

116
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,377
Help me down?

117
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,337
Help you down?

118
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,888
Made up your mind yet?

119
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,723
I'll take chocolate.

120
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,517
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.

121
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,561
You don't like coconuts?

122
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,065
Say, brainless, don't you know
where coconuts come from?

123
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,067
Lookit here.

124
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,361
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands,
the Coral Sea.

125
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,907
A new magazine. I never saw it before.

126
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,493
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.

127
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,997
I've been nominated for membership
in the National Geographic Society.

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,417
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

129
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:02,254
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.

130
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,257
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.

131
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,594
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems
and maybe three or four wives.

132
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,929
Wait and see.

133
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,310
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?

134
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,854
You're not paid to be a canary.

135
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,481
No, sir.

136
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,845
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?

137
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,054
No.

138
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,391
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.

139
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,309
I'll get them, sir.

140
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,187
Quick, take those capsules
over to Mrs. Blaine.

141
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,606
She's waiting for them.

142
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,024
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,716
They have the diphtheria there,
haven't they, sir?

144
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,884
Yeah.

145
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,760
Is it a charge, sir?

146
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,429
Yes, George.

147
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,097
Mr. Gower, I...

148
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,600
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,295
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?

150
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,839
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.

151
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,716
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.

152
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,301
It's shaping up into a storm.

153
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,511
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?

154
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,847
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?

155
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,141
I should have called him yesterday.

156
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,851
Switch it inside.

157
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,563
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

158
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,482
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.

159
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,359
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.

160
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,735
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.

161
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,488
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.

162
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,989
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.

163
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,908
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure

164
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,410
on these people of yours
to pay those mortgages?

165
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,829
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.

166
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:41,997
Well, then, foreclose.

167
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,749
I can't do that.
These families have children.

168
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,376
- Pop.
- They're not my children.

169
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,378
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.

170
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,005
Are you running a business
or a charity ward?

171
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,216
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

172
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,885
Mr. Potter, what makes you
such a hard-skulled character?

173
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,804
You have no family, no children.

174
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,764
You can't begin
to spend all the money you've got.

175
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,101
I suppose I should give it
to miserable failures

176
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,396
like you and that idiot brother of yours
to spend for me.

177
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,689
He's not a failure!

178
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,608
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.

179
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,026
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...

180
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,611
- Run along, run along.
...bigger than him,

181
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,863
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

182
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,699
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.

183
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,450
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.

184
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,286
I'll talk to you tonight.

185
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,627
What?

186
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,047
Why, that medicine should have
been there an hour ago.

187
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,092
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.

188
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,307
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

189
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,017
I... You...

190
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,185
Didn't you hear what I said?

191
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,353
Yes, sir. I...

192
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,939
What kind of tricks
are you playing anyway?

193
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,694
Why didn't you deliver them right away?

194
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,321
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

195
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,864
You're hurting my sore ear.

196
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,532
You lazy loafer.

197
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,534
Mr. Gower,
you don't know what you're doing.

198
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,494
You put something wrong
in those capsules.

199
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,829
I know you're unhappy.

200
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,622
You got the telegram, and you're upset.

201
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,541
You put something bad
in those capsules.

202
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,960
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

203
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,421
Just look and see what you did.

204
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,090
The bottle you took the powder from,
it's poison.

205
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,884
I tell you, it's poison.

206
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,802
I know you feel bad.

207
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,893
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!

208
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:30,022
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.

209
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,941
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

210
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,401
I know how you're feeling.

211
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,154
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.

212
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,114
Oh, George. George.

213
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,034
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.

214
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,285
Combination lock.

215
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,705
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

216
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,791
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.

217
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,418
I want a big one.

218
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,253
What did you stop it for?

219
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,590
I want you to take a good look
at that face.

220
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,716
Who is it?

221
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,884
George Bailey.

222
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,929
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears
slapped back by the druggist?

223
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,305
That's the kid.

224
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,393
It's a good face. I like it.

225
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,311
I like George Bailey.

226
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,398
Tell me,
did he ever tell anyone about the pills?

227
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,649
Not a soul.

228
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,735
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?

229
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,570
Well, wait and see.

230
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,407
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.

231
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,492
I want something for 1,001 nights

232
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,080
with plenty of room here for labels
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.

233
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,289
Great big thing, about...

234
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,542
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

235
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,044
I don't suppose you'd like
this old secondhand job, would you?

236
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,337
Now you're talking.

237
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,298
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft
in case the boat sunk.

238
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,634
- How much this cost?
- No charge.

239
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,429
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."

240
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,513
That's right.

241
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,391
Well, what's my name doing on it?

242
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,519
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.

243
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,981
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?

244
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,315
What boat are you sailing on?

245
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,942
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

246
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,194
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

247
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,407
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?

248
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,951
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.

249
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,077
Forget it.

250
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,746
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.

251
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,623
I wish I had a million dollars.

252
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,958
Hot dog!

253
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,294
Avast there, Captain Cook!

254
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,629
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous francais, mister?

255
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,965
Hey, send us some of those
picture postcards, will you, George?

256
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,800
Hey, George,
don't take any plug nickels.

257
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,552
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

258
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,845
Hey, Ernie!

259
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,389
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.

260
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,266
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.

261
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,809
How about driving me home in style?

262
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,561
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.

263
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,564
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.

264
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,359
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

265
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,652
Hello, Violet.

266
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,030
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.

267
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,615
This old thing?

268
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,576
Why, I only wear it
when I don't care how I look.

269
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,135
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.

270
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,222
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.

271
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,389
No, thanks.

272
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,768
I think I'll go home
and see what the wife's doing.

273
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,938
Family man.

274
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,192
George, Harry,
you're shaking the house down.

275
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,360
Stop it.

276
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,071
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.

277
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,115
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!

278
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,117
That's why all children should be girls.

279
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,871
Well, if they were all girls
there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.

280
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,541
George, Harry,
come down to dinner this minute.

281
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,627
Everything's getting cold, and you know
how long we've been waiting for you.

282
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,462
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.

283
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,799
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

284
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,887
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.

285
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,766
Oh, you two idiots.

286
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,810
George, sit down and have dinner.

287
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,894
- Fine.
- I've eaten.

288
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,730
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing
for your graduating party? Look at you!

289
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,232
I don't care. It's George's tux.

290
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,109
Annie, my sweet,
have you got those pies?

291
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,403
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!

292
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,698
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.

293
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,743
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal
in the old Bailey boarding house.

294
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,745
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.

295
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,206
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta
take over a lot of plates and things.

296
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,249
What plates?

297
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,709
Mom, I'm chairman
of the Eats Committee.

298
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,960
We only need a couple of dozen.

299
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,422
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.

300
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,507
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

301
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,594
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

302
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,178
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

303
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,597
What's the matter? You look tired.

304
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,890
I had another tussle with Potter today.

305
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,976
I thought when we put him
on the board of directors,

306
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,394
he'd ease up on us a little bit.

307
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,355
What's eating that old
money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

308
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,358
He's a sick man, frustrated,
sick in his mind.

309
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,277
Sick in his soul, if he has one.

310
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,113
He hates everybody
that has anything that he can't have.

311
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,865
He hates us mostly, I guess.

312
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,283
Gangway. Gangway.

313
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,826
- So long, Pop.
- So long.

314
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,911
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.

315
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:55,954
Put those things in the car,

316
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,290
and I'll get your tie and studs ready
for you. Now, hurry up.

317
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,625
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.

318
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,917
You coming later, George?

319
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,294
What do you mean,
and be bored to death?

320
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,962
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls,

321
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,464
and we're gonna use
that new floor tonight, too.

322
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,215
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.

323
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,508
Oh, Pop, just a little?

324
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,427
No, Son. Not one drop.

325
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,138
Boys and girls and music.

326
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,098
Why do they need gin?

327
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,226
Did I act like that
when I graduated from high school?

328
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,478
Pretty much.

329
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,648
You know, George, I wish
we could send Harry to college with you.

330
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,317
Your mother and I talked it over
half the night.

331
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,277
We have that all figured out.

332
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,488
You see, Harry will take my job
at the Building and Loan,

333
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,324
work there for four years, then he'll go.

334
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,076
Pretty young for that job.

335
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,869
Well, no younger than I was.

336
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,288
Well, you were born older, George.

337
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,832
How's that?

338
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,626
I said you were born older.

339
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,086
I suppose you've decided
what you want to do

340
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,462
when you get out of college.

341
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,506
Well, you know
what I've always talked about,

342
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,009
build things, design new buildings,
plan modern cities.

343
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,427
All that stuff I've been talking about.

344
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,304
Still after that first million
before you're 30?

345
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,848
I'll settle for half that in cash.

346
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,559
Of course, it's just a hope.

347
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,853
But you wouldn't consider coming back

348
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,147
to the Building and Loan, would you?

349
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,401
Well, I... I...

350
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,864
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable,

351
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,783
and you could hear everything
that's going on.

352
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,327
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.

353
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,954
You would, eh?

354
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,248
I know it's soon to talk about it.

355
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,917
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.

356
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,920
I couldn't face being cooped up
for the rest of my life

357
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,797
in a shabby little office.

358
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,260
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...

359
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,971
It's this business of nickels and dimes

360
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,223
and spending all your life
trying to figure out

361
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,225
how to save three cents
on a length of pipe.

362
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,395
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big
and something important.

363
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,398
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way,

364
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,400
we're doing something important,

365
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,736
satisfying a fundamental urge.

366
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,073
It's deep in the race for a man to want
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

367
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,117
And we're helping him get those things

368
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,869
in our shabby little office.

369
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,622
I know, Pop. I know that.

370
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,750
I wish I felt that...

371
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:09,254
I've been hoarding pennies
like a miser here in order to...

372
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,466
Most of my friends
have already finished college.

373
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,969
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.

374
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,682
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.

375
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,476
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

376
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,102
This town is no place for any man

377
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,480
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

378
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,107
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.

379
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,069
You get yourself an education
and get out of here.

380
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,449
Pop, you want a shock?

381
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,077
I think you're a great guy.

382
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,917
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.

383
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,920
It's about time
one of you lunkheads said it.

384
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,173
I'm gonna miss old Annie.

385
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,805
Pop, I think I'll get dressed
and go over to Harry's party.

386
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,515
Have a good time, Son.

387
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,729
Excuse me.

388
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,314
There you are.

389
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,482
George, hello.

390
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,775
You know my kid brother George.

391
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,819
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.

392
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,195
Hee-haw!

393
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,655
Sam Wainwright.

394
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,323
How are you? When did you get here?

395
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,492
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

396
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,952
Old college graduate now.

397
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,120
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright
they call me.

398
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,998
Well, freshman, looks like
you're gonna make it after all, huh?

399
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,501
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.

400
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,628
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

401
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,547
Yeah, he's followed every game,
and his mouth's watering.

402
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,799
He wants me to find out
if you're gonna come along with us.

403
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,425
Well, I got to make some dough first.

404
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,053
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.

405
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,805
Not broken down old guys like this one.

406
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,014
Hee-haw!

407
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,475
George, welcome back.

408
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,185
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

409
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,479
Putting a pool under this floor was
a great idea.

410
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,856
Saved us another building.

411
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,816
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

412
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,694
There's lots of stuff here to eat
and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.

413
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,654
A third dance... A third...

414
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,866
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?

415
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,117
George.

416
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,035
Marty! Well, it's old home week.

417
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,204
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?

418
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,164
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

419
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,667
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

420
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,044
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?

421
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,462
Dance with her, will you?

422
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,674
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough
already with all these kids.

423
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,800
Come on, be a sport.

424
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,220
Just dance with her one time, and you'll
give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!

425
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,805
Don't be long, Marty.

426
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,599
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...

427
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,684
The next thing I knew,
some guy came up and tripped me.

428
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,686
That's the reason why I came in fourth.

429
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,480
If it hadn't been for that,
that race'd have been a cinch.

430
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,525
I tried to find out who it was later,
but I couldn't find out.

431
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,279
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was,
because they'd be scared.

432
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,822
'Cause they know
what kind of a guy I am.

433
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,033
You remember George. This is Mary.

434
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,743
Well, I'll be seeing you.

435
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,911
Well, well, well.

436
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,705
Now to get back to my story, see?

437
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,168
Hey, this is my dance.

438
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,836
Why don't you stop annoying people?

439
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,047
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

440
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,886
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

441
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,555
You look at me as if you didn't know me.

442
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,848
Well, I don't.

443
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,267
You've passed me on the street
almost every day.

444
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,435
Me?

445
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,688
No. That was a little girl
named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

446
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,525
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!

447
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,572
The prize, a genuine loving cup.

448
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,450
Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor.

449
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,660
Let's go!

450
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,421
I'm not very good at this.

451
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,090
Neither am I.

452
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,050
Okay. What can we lose?

453
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,397
Hey, you're wonderful.

454
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,135
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?

455
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,015
Did you know there's a swimming pool
under this floor?

456
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,269
And did you know that button behind you
causes this floor to open up?

457
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,690
And did you further know
that George Bailey

458
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,109
is dancing right over that crack?

459
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,279
And I've got the key.

460
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,554
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

461
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,436
They're cheering us. We must be good.

462
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,809
Get out of there!

463
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,435
What... Oh, well.

464
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,195
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

465
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,073
Can't you come out tonight?

466
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,659
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

467
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,538
And dance

468
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,624
By the light

469
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:24,254
Of the moon?

470
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,632
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

471
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,884
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.

472
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,220
You should have seen
the commotion in that locker room.

473
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,056
I had to knock down three people
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

474
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,016
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.

475
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,768
Do I look as funny as you do?

476
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,687
I guess I'm not quite the football type.

477
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,522
You look wonderful!

478
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,274
You know, if it wasn't me talking,

479
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,943
I'd say you were
the prettiest girl in town.

480
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,988
Well, why don't you say it?

481
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,408
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?

482
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,535
Eighteen.

483
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,122
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year
you were seventeen.

484
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,166
Too young or too old?

485
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,960
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.

486
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,505
Yes, sir, you look a little older
without your clothes on.

487
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,967
I mean, without a dress you look older.

488
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,970
I mean younger. You look... You just...

489
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,015
I'm on the thing here.

490
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,017
Sir, my train, please.

491
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,811
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

492
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,148
Your caboose, milady.

493
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,151
You may kiss my hand.

494
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,071
Hey.

495
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,450
Hey, Mary.

496
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,537
As I was lumberin' down the street

497
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,040
Down the street, down the street

498
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,709
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock
at the old Granville house.

499
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,961
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

500
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,963
No, you see, you make a wish
and then try and break some glass.

501
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,673
And you got to be
a pretty good shot nowadays, too.

502
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,635
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.

503
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,929
I'd like to live in it.

504
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,138
In that place?

505
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,557
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.

506
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,268
Right in the second floor, there. See?

507
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,149
What did you wish, George?

508
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,652
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.

509
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,820
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

510
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,531
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

511
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,451
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

512
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,286
and I'm gonna see the world!

513
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,456
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon,
the Coliseum.

514
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,209
Then I'm coming back here and go
to college to see what they know.

515
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,919
And then I'm gonna build things.

516
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,420
I'm gonna build airfields.

517
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,881
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

518
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,342
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

519
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,844
What, are you gonna throw a rock?

520
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,642
Hey, that's pretty good.

521
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,311
What did you wish, Mary?

522
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,275
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

523
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,278
Can't you come out tonight?

524
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,364
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

525
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,450
And

526
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:03,579
Dance by the light of the moon?

527
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,623
What did you wish
when you threw that rock?

528
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,125
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

529
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,793
If I told you, it might not come true.

530
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,628
What is it you want, Mary?

531
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,506
What do you want? You want the moon?

532
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,135
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso
around it and pull it down.

533
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:21,014
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

534
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,598
I'll take it.

535
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,100
Then what?

536
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,062
Well, then you could swallow it,
and it would all dissolve, see?

537
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,941
And the moonbeams would shoot out
of your fingers and your toes

538
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,068
and the ends of your hair.

539
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,114
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!

540
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,409
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

541
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,535
How's that?

542
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,080
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

543
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,334
You want me to kiss her, huh?

544
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,795
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.

545
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,216
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!

546
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:01,554
I'll show you some kissing that'll put
hair back on your head. What are you...

547
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:09,979
Mary?

548
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,117
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

549
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,329
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

550
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,915
Here you are. Catch.

551
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,418
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

552
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,133
This is a very interesting situation.

553
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,052
Please give me my robe.

554
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,640
A man doesn't get in a situation
like this every day.

555
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,725
I'd like to have my robe.

556
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,352
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

557
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,646
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

558
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,399
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

559
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,150
Give me my robe.

560
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,653
I've read about things like this,
but I've never...

561
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,906
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

562
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,575
My mother's way up on the corner there.

563
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,619
I'll call the police.

564
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,497
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.

565
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,457
Then I'm going to scream!

566
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,960
Maybe I could sell tickets.

567
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,172
Let's see. No, the point is

568
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,967
in order to get this robe... I've got it.

569
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,927
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.

570
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,346
George! George!

571
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,101
George, come on home! Quick!

572
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,603
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?

573
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,857
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- Come on, George, let's hurry.

574
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,024
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.

575
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,943
Campbell's there now.

576
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,164
I think that's all
we'll need you for, George.

577
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:54,125
- I know you're anxious to make a train.
- I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

578
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,003
I want the board to know
that George gave up his trip to Europe

579
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,839
to help straighten things out here
these past few months.

580
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,799
Good luck to you at school, George.

581
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,843
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.

582
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,554
And now we come to the real purpose
of this meeting,

583
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,307
to appoint a successor
to our dear friend Peter Bailey.

584
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,559
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.

585
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,853
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

586
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,315
I claim this institution
is not necessary to this town.

587
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,235
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make
a motion to dissolve this institution

588
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,614
and turn its assets and liabilities
over to the receiver.

589
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,657
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.

590
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:27,742
George, did you hear
what that buzzard...

591
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,868
Mr. Chairman.

592
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,745
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death

593
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,164
to talk about chloroforming
the Building and Loan.

594
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,666
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

595
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,543
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

596
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,045
Very well. In that case,

597
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:43,007
I'll ask the two executive officers
to withdraw. But before you go,

598
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,219
I'm sure the whole board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

599
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,513
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

600
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,515
It was his faith and devotion

601
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,183
that are responsible
for this organization.

602
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,185
I'll go further than that.

603
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,689
I'll say that to the public
Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.

604
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,983
That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

605
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,027
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave.

606
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,947
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

607
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,490
That's what killed him.

608
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,284
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.

609
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,829
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.

610
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,167
But ideals without common sense
can ruin this town.

611
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,754
Now, you take this loan here
to Ernie Bishop,

612
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,174
you know,
that fellow that sits around all day

613
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,052
on his brains in his taxi, you know.

614
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,931
I happen to know
the bank turned down this loan.

615
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,724
But he comes here,

616
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:38,563
and we're building him
a house worth $5,000.

617
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,732
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

618
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,694
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.

619
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,112
I can personally vouch for his character.

620
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,114
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

621
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,451
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

622
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,787
you can come and borrow money.

623
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,956
What does that get us?

624
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,917
A discontented, lazy rabble

625
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,919
instead of a thrifty working class.

626
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:05,798
And all because
a few starry-eyed dreamers

627
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,093
like Peter Bailey stir them up
and fill their heads

628
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,429
with a lot of impossible ideas.

629
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,306
Now, I say...

630
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,267
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

631
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,604
You're right when you say my father
was no businessman. I know that.

632
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,315
Why he ever started this cheap
penny-ante Building and Loan

633
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,482
I'll never know.

634
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,444
But neither you nor anybody else
can say anything against his character,

635
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,237
because his whole life was...

636
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,948
Why, in the 25 years since he
and Uncle Billy started this thing,

637
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,326
he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

638
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,287
He didn't save enough money
to send Harry to school, let alone me.

639
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,123
But he did help a few people
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

640
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,294
And what's wrong with that?
Why, here, you're all businessmen here.

641
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,631
Don't it make them better citizens, and
doesn't it make them better customers?

642
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,924
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?

643
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,801
They had to wait and save their money

644
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,345
before they even thought
of a decent home.

645
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,138
Wait? Wait for what?

646
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,890
Until their children grow up
and leave them?

647
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,142
Until they're so old
and broken-down that they...

648
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,853
Do you know how long it takes
a working man to save $5,000?

649
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,315
Just remember this, Mr. Potter,
that this rabble you're talking about,

650
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,319
they do most of the working and paying
and living and dying in this community.

651
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,863
Well, is it too much to have them work
and pay and live and die

652
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,740
in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?

653
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,909
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

654
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,870
People were human beings to him,
but to you,

655
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,915
a warped, frustrated old man,
they're cattle.

656
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,501
Well, in my book, he died
a much richer man than you'll ever be.

657
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,503
I'm not interested in your book.

658
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,339
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

659
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,132
I know very well
what you're talking about.

660
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,510
You're talking about something
you can't get your fingers on,

661
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,429
and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.

662
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,807
Well, I've said too much. I...

663
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,185
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.

664
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,853
There's just one thing more, though.

665
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,564
This town needs
this measly one-horse institution

666
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:49,235
if only to have someplace where people
can come without crawling to Potter.

667
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,444
Come on, Uncle Billy.

668
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,829
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

669
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,542
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.

670
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,419
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

671
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,212
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.

672
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,923
Well, we're being voted
out of business after 25 years.

673
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,510
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."

674
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,554
You still want me
to hang around, George?

675
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,181
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.

676
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,058
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.

677
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,936
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.

678
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,064
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.

679
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,899
- I'm only 55.
- 56.

680
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,318
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip,

681
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,987
now you don't want to miss college,
too, do you?

682
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,531
George! George!
They voted Potter down.

683
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,408
They want to keep it going.

684
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,952
You did it, George. You did it.

685
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,246
They got one condition,
only one condition.

686
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,914
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.

687
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,000
They've appointed George here
as Executive Secretary

688
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,376
to take his father's place.

689
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:50,296
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
- You can keep him on. That's all right.

690
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,298
As Secretary,
you can hire anyone you like.

691
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,009
Dr. Campbell, now let's get
this thing straight. I'm leaving.

692
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,719
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.

693
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,263
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

694
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,183
But, George,
they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

695
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,021
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.

696
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,441
Not only that, but he gave
his school money to his brother, Harry,

697
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,026
and sent him to college.

698
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,986
Harry became a football star.

699
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,362
Made second team all-American.

700
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,073
Yeah, but what happened to George?

701
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,368
George got four years older,
waiting for Harry to come back

702
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,537
and take over the Building and Loans.

703
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,956
There are plenty of jobs around
for somebody that likes to travel.

704
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,041
Look at this. Here.

705
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,462
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted,
man with construction experience."

706
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,547
Here's the Yukon, right here.

707
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,008
"Wanted,
man with engineering experience."

708
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,969
There she blows.

709
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,931
You know what the three most exciting
sounds in the world are?

710
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,266
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...

711
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:48,062
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains,
plane motors and train whistles.

712
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,314
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.

713
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,691
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa
all-American Bailey.

714
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,819
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.

715
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,488
What? No husky dogs? No sled?
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

716
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,114
Nobody ever changes here,
you know that.

717
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,866
Oh, am I glad to see you.

718
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:03,160
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

719
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,079
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.

720
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,123
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.

721
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,542
- Hello.
- How do you do?

722
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,378
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

723
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,839
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.

724
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,549
Here she is. Meet the wife.

725
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,468
Well, what do you know? A wife.

726
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,347
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?

727
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,141
What am I doing? Congratulations!

728
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,977
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!

729
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,187
Why don't you tell somebody?

730
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,857
Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.

731
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,358
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.

732
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,151
What's a pretty girl like you doing

733
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,195
marrying this two-headed brother
of mine?

734
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,990
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.
My father offered him a job.

735
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:45,202
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

736
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:49,874
George, about that job. Ruth spoke
out of turn. I never said I'd take it.

737
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,793
You've been holding the bag here
for four years, and,

738
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,671
well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...

739
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,883
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.

740
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,175
It was a surprise to me.

741
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,219
This is the new Mrs. Bailey,
my nephew's wife.

742
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:06,098
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.

743
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,310
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...

744
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,313
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.

745
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,773
And I want to tell you,
we're gonna give the biggest party

746
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,317
this town ever saw.

747
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,821
Here, have some popcorn.

748
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,492
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.

749
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,828
Ruth, this...

750
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,079
What about this job?

751
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,582
Well, my father owns a glass factory
in Buffalo.

752
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,418
He wants to get Harry started
in the research business.

753
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,670
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

754
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,423
Not much money,
but good future, you know.

755
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,842
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.

756
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:45,346
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

757
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:00,986
Hey, Joe.

758
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:04,657
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.

759
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:09,411
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think I will.

760
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,997
What did you say? Huh?

761
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,792
Maybe I'd better go home.

762
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,211
Where's my hat? Where's my...

763
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,131
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.

764
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,301
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look,

765
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,721
if you'll point me in the right direction...
Would you do that, George?

766
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,973
Right down here.

767
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,767
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?

768
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,144
Now you just turn this way
and then right straight down there.

769
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,312
Oh, that way, huh?

770
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:40,693
My wild Irish rose

771
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,323
I'm all right. I'm all right.

772
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:51,245
The sweetest flower I know

773
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,908
Hello, Ma.

774
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,704
That's for nothing.

775
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,666
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?

776
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,544
Looks like
she can keep Harry on his toes.

777
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,963
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

778
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,885
Did you know that Mary Hatch
is back from school?

779
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,637
Came back three days ago.

780
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,807
Nice girl, Mary.

781
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,479
Kind that'll help you
find the answers, George.

782
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,023
Stop that grunting.

783
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,487
Can you give me one good reason
why you shouldn't call on Mary?

784
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,988
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

785
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,032
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

786
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,409
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?

787
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,244
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.

788
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,081
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?

789
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:20,501
Why, she lights up like a firefly
whenever you're around.

790
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,088
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,

791
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:28,175
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.

792
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,511
I don't know about war.

793
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,601
Mother of mine, I can see right through
you right to your back-collar button.

794
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,686
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

795
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,775
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?

796
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,737
All right, Mother,
old Building and Loan pal,

797
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:52,074
I think I'll go out and find a girl
and do a little passionate necking.

798
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,367
Oh, George.

799
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,495
Now, if you'll just point me
in the right direction...

800
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,164
This direction.

801
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,048
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

802
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,104
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.

803
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,314
I think I got a date.

804
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,151
But stick around, fellows,
just in case, huh?

805
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,237
We'll wait for you, baby.

806
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,408
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.

807
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,661
- What gives?
- Nothing.

808
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,997
Where are you going?

809
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,916
Oh, I'll probably end up
down at the library.

810
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:47,379
Georgie, don't you ever get tired
of just reading about things?

811
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,506
Yes.

812
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,843
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

813
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,220
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.

814
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,514
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?

815
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,516
Let's go out in the fields
and take off our shoes

816
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,019
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?

817
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,022
Then we can go up to the falls.
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

818
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:09,276
and there's a green pool up there,
and we can swim in it.

819
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,113
Then we can climb Mount Bedford
and smell the pines

820
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,865
and watch the sunrise
against the peaks,

821
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,366
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

822
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,702
and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.

823
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,581
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?

824
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,667
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.

825
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:30,130
- If you think...
- Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

826
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:51,193
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.

827
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,363
I just happened to be passing by here.

828
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,281
Yes, so I noticed.

829
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,201
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

830
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,912
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?

831
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,372
About coming in.

832
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,041
Your mother just phoned
and said you were on your way over

833
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,919
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?

834
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,379
Well, how did she know?

835
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,422
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

836
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,342
I just went for a walk
and happened to be passing by here.

837
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,969
What do you...

838
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,639
Went for a walk. That's all.

839
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,893
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.

840
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,042
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

841
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,628
Well, I'll come in for a minute.

842
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,048
But I...

843
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,230
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.

844
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,526
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

845
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,571
Where did you get that dress?

846
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,240
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

847
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:26,496
I thought you would go back
to New York,

848
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,915
like Sam and Angie
and the rest of them.

849
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,920
I worked there a couple of vacations,
but I don't know.

850
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,380
I guess I was homesick.

851
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,467
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

852
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,762
Yes, and my family and...

853
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,139
Everything.

854
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,184
Would you like to sit down?

855
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,102
All right, for a minute.

856
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,855
I still can't understand it, though.

857
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,066
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.

858
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,525
Would you rather leave?

859
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,444
No. I don't want to be rude.

860
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,071
Well, then, sit down.

861
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,447
What's that?

862
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,035
Some joke, huh?

863
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,333
Well...

864
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,587
I see it still smells like pine needles
around here.

865
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,464
Thank you.

866
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,473
And dance by the

867
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,308
What's the matter?

868
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,228
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

869
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,232
Well...

870
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,692
Nice about your brother Harry
and Ruth, isn't it?

871
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,861
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

872
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,279
Don't you like her?

873
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,824
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.

874
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,912
Oh, just marriage in general
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

875
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:53,542
No. Marriage is all right
for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

876
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,335
Mary! Mary!

877
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,795
Who's down there with you?

878
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,755
It's George Bailey, Mother.

879
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:01,550
George Bailey? What's he want?

880
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,176
I don't know.

881
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,970
What do you want?

882
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,473
Me? Not a thing.

883
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,600
I just came in to get warm.

884
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,730
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

885
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,526
You tell him to go right back home,
and don't you leave the house, either!

886
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,737
Sam Wainwright promised to call you
from New York tonight.

887
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:25,824
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...

888
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,452
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.

889
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,121
You're supposed to be the one
that has all the answers. You tell me.

890
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,081
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.

891
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,791
I don't know why I came here
in the first place.

892
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,334
- Good night.
- Good night!

893
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,463
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.

894
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,755
I'll get it.

895
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,633
Whatever were you doing
that you couldn't hear?

896
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,978
Mary, he's waiting.

897
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,524
Hello?

898
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,819
Forgot my hat.

899
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,033
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

900
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:11,161
I'm great.
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.

901
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,080
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.

902
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,293
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.

903
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,295
You mean old mossback George?

904
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,006
Yes, old mossback George.

905
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,008
Hee-haw! Put him on.

906
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,385
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!

907
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,679
He doesn't want to speak to George,
you idiot.

908
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,598
He does so. He asked for him.

909
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,143
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

910
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,565
Hi, Sam.

911
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,486
Well, George Baileyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.

912
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,404
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?

913
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,489
What do you mean?

914
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,366
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.

915
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,368
Here... Here's Mary.

916
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,828
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.

917
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:55,372
Tell Mary to get on the extension.

918
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,792
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!

919
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,919
We can both hear. Come here.

920
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,713
We're listening, Sam.

921
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:07,342
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up
that's gonna make us all rich.

922
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,011
George, do you remember
that night in Martini's bar

923
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:13,765
when you told me you'd read someplace
about making plastics out of soybeans?

924
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,017
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?

925
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,812
You remember, out of chili...
Out of soybeans.

926
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,066
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.

927
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,485
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea,

928
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,071
and he's gonna build
a factory outside of Rochester.

929
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,698
How do you like that?

930
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,619
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

931
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:37,455
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?

932
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,167
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?

933
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,963
You remember that old tool
and machinery works?

934
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,090
You tell your father
he can get that for a song.

935
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,425
And all the labor he wants, too.

936
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,969
Half the town was thrown out of work
when they closed down.

937
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,346
That so? Well, I'll tell him.

938
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,764
Hey, that sounds great.

939
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,725
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

940
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,853
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.

941
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,355
Now listen. Have you got any money?

942
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,068
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.

943
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,111
Well, now, listen.

944
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,406
I want you to put every cent you've got
into our stock, do you hear?

945
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,200
And, George, I may have a job for you,

946
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:18,246
that is unless you're still married
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

947
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,540
Well, this is the biggest thing
since radio,

948
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,751
and I'm letting you in
on the ground floor.

949
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:24,878
Oh, Mary. Mary?

950
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:28,798
I'm here.

951
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,134
Would you tell that guy

952
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,303
I'm giving him the chance
of a lifetime, do you hear?

953
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,221
The chance of a lifetime!

954
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,144
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

955
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,191
Now you listen to me.

956
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,402
I don't want any plastics,
and I don't want any ground floors.

957
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,446
And I don't want to get married,
ever, to anyone.

958
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,947
You understand that?

959
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,991
I want to do what I want to do.

960
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:58,119
And you're... And you're...

961
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,706
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.

962
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,710
Oh, Mary.

963
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:10,840
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

964
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,677
Mary...

965
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,179
Here they come! Here they come!

966
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,289
Goodbye, George!

967
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,961
Goodbye!

968
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,887
First Harry, now George.

969
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,181
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

970
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,392
You speak for yourself, Miss B.

971
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,440
If either of you two
see a stranger around here, it's me.

972
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:13,069
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.

973
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:14,988
Bert the cop sent this over.

974
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,449
He said to float away
to Happyland on the bubbles.

975
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,743
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!

976
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,996
By the way, where are you two going
on this here now honeymoon?

977
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,206
Where are we going? Look at this.

978
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,667
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

979
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:29,836
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.

980
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,297
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.

981
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:34,632
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.

982
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,177
The highest hotels,
the oldest champagne,

983
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:41,765
the richest caviar, the hottest music
and the prettiest wife.

984
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,100
That does it! Then what?

985
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:47,187
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?

986
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,647
That does it, come here. Come here.

987
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,360
Don't look now,
but there's something funny

988
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,654
going on over there
at the bank, George.

989
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:00,784
I've never really seen one, but that's got
all the earmarks of being a run.

990
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,294
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money
in the bank, you better hurry.

991
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,129
George, let's not stop. Let's go!

992
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,714
Just a minute, dear.

993
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:21,304
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

994
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,365
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

995
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,284
Charlie? What's the matter here,
can't you get in?

996
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,887
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

997
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,305
George.

998
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:09,018
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.

999
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,520
Look out, you.

1000
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,357
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?

1001
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,609
There are a lot of seats over there.

1002
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,487
Just make yourselves at home.

1003
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,491
George, can I see you a minute?

1004
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,327
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

1005
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,996
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.

1006
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,622
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?

1007
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,832
How does a thing like this ever start?

1008
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,584
- All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When?

1009
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,878
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.

1010
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,296
- All of it?
- Every cent of it,

1011
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,756
- and still it was less than we owe them.
- Holy mackerel!

1012
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,967
And then I got scared, George,
and closed the doors.

1013
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,719
I... I...

1014
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,514
The whole town's gone crazy.

1015
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:47,932
Yeah, hello?

1016
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,143
George, it's Potter.

1017
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:54,772
Hello?

1018
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:59,235
George, there is a rumor around town
that you've closed your doors.

1019
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,778
Is that true?

1020
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,406
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

1021
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,826
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?

1022
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,286
Police? What for?

1023
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,332
Well, mobs get pretty ugly
sometimes, you know.

1024
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:17,128
George, I'm going all out
to help in this crisis.

1025
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:22,383
I've just guaranteed the bank
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

1026
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,095
They'll close up for a week
and then reopen.

1027
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,765
He just took over the bank.

1028
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,642
I may lose a fortune,

1029
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,604
but I'm willing
to guarantee your people, too.

1030
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,148
Just tell them
to bring their shares over here,

1031
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,817
and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.

1032
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,028
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?

1033
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,279
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

1034
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:47,075
If you close your doors before 6:00 p. M.,
you will never reopen.

1035
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,335
George, was it a nice wedding?

1036
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,420
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

1037
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,880
Yeah.

1038
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,717
You can take this one off now.

1039
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,898
Now, just remember that this thing
isn't as black as it appeared.

1040
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,493
I have some news for you, folks.

1041
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,995
I was just talking to old man Potter,

1042
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,705
and he's guaranteed cash payments
at the bank.

1043
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,331
The bank's gonna reopen next week.

1044
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,333
But, George, I got my money here.

1045
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,002
Did he guarantee this place?

1046
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:42,130
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.
We don't need Potter over here.

1047
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,923
Then, I'll take mine now.

1048
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,925
No, but you're...

1049
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,845
You're thinking of this place all wrong,

1050
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:52,515
as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.

1051
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,143
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.

1052
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,478
And in the Kennedy house
and Mrs. Macklin's house

1053
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,063
and 100 others.

1054
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,732
Why, you're lending them
the money to build,

1055
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,859
and then, they're gonna pay it back
to you as best they can.

1056
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,610
Now, what are you gonna do,
foreclose on them?

1057
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:10,742
I got $242 in here,
and $242 isn't going to break anybody.

1058
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,203
Okay, Tom. All right.

1059
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:17,040
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.

1060
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,249
Sixty days?

1061
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,376
Now, that's what you agreed to
when you bought your shares.

1062
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,587
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.

1063
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:23,713
Well, I did.

1064
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,424
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents
on the dollar for every share you've got.

1065
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,093
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

1066
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,762
Well, what do you say?

1067
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,473
Now, Tom, you have to stick
to your original agreement.

1068
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:34,891
Now, give us 60 days on this.

1069
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,060
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?

1070
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,228
Better to get half than nothing.

1071
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,397
Tom! Tom!

1072
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,649
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.

1073
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:47,820
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.

1074
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,989
If Potter gets a hold
of this Building and Loan,

1075
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,033
there'll never be
another decent house built in this town.

1076
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,618
He's already got charge of the bank.

1077
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,745
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.

1078
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,581
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.

1079
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,917
Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

1080
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,086
And because he wants
to keep you living in his slums

1081
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,088
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

1082
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,090
Joe, you had one
of those Potter houses, didn't you?

1083
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,174
Well, have you forgotten?

1084
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,635
Have you forgotten what he charged you
for that broken-down shack?

1085
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,846
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last
year when things weren't going so well

1086
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,098
and you couldn't make your payments.

1087
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,641
Well, you didn't lose your house,
did you?

1088
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,476
You think Potter would've
let you keep it?

1089
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,270
Can't you understand
what's happening here?

1090
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,939
Don't you see what's happening?

1091
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:25,733
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?

1092
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:27,985
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.

1093
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,278
He's picking up some bargain.

1094
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,739
Now we can get through
this thing all right.

1095
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,616
We've got to stick together, though.

1096
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,201
We've got to have faith in each other.

1097
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,496
But my husband hasn't worked
in over a year, and I need money.

1098
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,289
How am going to live
until the bank opens?

1099
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,708
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.

1100
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,710
I can't feed my kids on faith.

1101
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,462
How much do you need?

1102
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:50,049
Hey! I got $2,000.

1103
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,136
Here's $2,000.
This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.

1104
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,013
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
- $242.

1105
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,641
Tom, just enough to tide you over
until the bank reopens.

1106
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,893
I'll take $242.

1107
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,481
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1108
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,859
Your account's still here. That's a loan.

1109
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:11,320
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.

1110
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,991
Now, Ed, what'll it take
till the bank opens? What do you need?

1111
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,410
Well, I suppose $20.

1112
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,329
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.

1113
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,998
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson,
how much do you want?

1114
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,374
But it's your own money, George.

1115
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,168
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?

1116
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,336
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.

1117
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,547
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.

1118
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,757
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.

1119
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:35,261
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.50?

1120
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,474
Bless your heart. Of course
you can have it. You got 50 cents?

1121
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,934
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.

1122
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,519
...six...
- They'll never close us up today!

1123
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:48,107
...five, four, three, two,

1124
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,359
one, bingo!

1125
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,069
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.

1126
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:55,072
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.

1127
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,991
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!

1128
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,492
Get some glasses, Tilly.

1129
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:01,829
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.

1130
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:04,415
Get a tray for these two
great big important simoleons here.

1131
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,042
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1132
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,587
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar
and to Papa Dollar,

1133
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,797
and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business,

1134
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,382
you better have a family real quick.

1135
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,302
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.

1136
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,430
Okay, let's put them in the safe
and see what happens.

1137
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,022
Close the door.

1138
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,024
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.

1139
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,527
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.

1140
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:36,239
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...

1141
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,491
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.

1142
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,952
I wonder if Ernie's still here
with his taxicab.

1143
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,454
George, there's a call for you.

1144
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,872
Look, will you get my wife
on the phone?

1145
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,332
She's probably over at her mother's.

1146
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,959
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

1147
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,086
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.

1148
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,714
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.

1149
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,176
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.

1150
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,305
Huh? Come home? What home?

1151
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,810
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?

1152
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,854
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1153
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:22,451
Hey, this is the company's posters,
and the company won't like this.

1154
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,537
How would you like
to get a ticket next week?

1155
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,955
You got any romance in you?

1156
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,624
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.

1157
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,210
Who wants to see liver pills
on their honeymoon?

1158
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,713
What we want is romantic places,
beautiful places,

1159
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,631
places George wants to go.

1160
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,718
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.

1161
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,052
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.

1162
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,013
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1163
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,973
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.

1164
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,599
What are they, ducks?

1165
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,646
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1166
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:53,566
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1167
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,286
Hiya... Good evening, sir.

1168
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,207
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1169
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,755
Well, I'll be...

1170
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,638
Mary. Mary, where did you...

1171
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,411
Oh, Mary.

1172
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:16,333
Remember the night we broke
some windows in this old house?

1173
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,795
This is what I wished for.

1174
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:30,639
You're wonderful.

1175
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:53,746
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

1176
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,458
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1177
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,251
I own the house.

1178
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:02,838
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.

1179
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:06,258
No more we live like a pigs
in this Potter's Field.

1180
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:09,428
- Mary, Mary!
- Mary, come on, bring the baby.

1181
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,889
I feel like a queen.

1182
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:15,059
- I'll take the kids in the car.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.

1183
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:18,062
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.

1184
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,314
Now, one at a time.
Get right up on the seat there.

1185
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,528
- Sit down, there.
- Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.

1186
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,948
- Goat, too.
- Everybody!

1187
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:30,616
All in!

1188
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,703
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1189
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,499
All in?

1190
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,937
Mr. And Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1191
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,982
Good old George,
he's always making a speech.

1192
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,359
Hee-haw!

1193
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:09,196
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.

1194
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,908
Bread. That this house
may never know hunger.

1195
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,996
Salt. That life may always have flavor.

1196
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,874
And wine. That joy and prosperity
may reign forever.

1197
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,710
Enter the Martini castle.

1198
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,006
Look, Mr. Potter,
it's no skin off my nose.

1199
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,924
I'm just your little rent collector.

1200
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:31,802
But you can't laugh off
this Bailey Park anymore.

1201
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,012
Look at it.

1202
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,931
Congressman Black is here
to see you, sir.

1203
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,976
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.

1204
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,854
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen
houses stuck here and there.

1205
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,189
There's the old cemetery, squirrels,
buttercups, daisies.

1206
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,483
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1207
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,694
Look at it today.

1208
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,655
Dozens of the prettiest little homes
you ever saw,

1209
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:55,034
90% owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you.

1210
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,454
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

1211
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:01,957
And are the local yokels making with
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1212
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,792
Oh, they are, are they?

1213
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,795
Even though they know
the Baileys never made a dime out of it.

1214
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,381
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.

1215
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,425
Every one of these homes is worth

1216
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,636
twice what it cost
the Building and Loan to build.

1217
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,138
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.

1218
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,725
As I say, it's no skin off my nose,

1219
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,813
but one of these days
this bright young man

1220
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,524
is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.

1221
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:33,030
The Bailey family has been
a boil on my neck long enough.

1222
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,240
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1223
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,743
We just stopped in town
to take a look at the new factory,

1224
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,828
and then we're gonna
drive on down to Florida.

1225
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,538
Why don't you
have your friends join us?

1226
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:45,042
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids
drive down with us, huh?

1227
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,170
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.

1228
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,339
Still got the nose
to the old grindstone, eh?

1229
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:54,009
Jane, I offered to let George in
on the ground floor in plastics,

1230
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:55,260
and he turned me down cold.

1231
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,138
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1232
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,848
Well, I guess we better run along.

1233
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,975
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1234
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,435
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.

1235
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,978
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.

1236
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,147
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.

1237
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,233
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!

1238
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,026
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.

1239
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,640
Thank you, sir.

1240
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,184
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?

1241
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:45,811
I'll send you a box.

1242
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:55,946
Well, I...

1243
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,991
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later,

1244
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,952
but just what exactly
did you want to see me about?

1245
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,666
George, now that's just what I like
so much about you.

1246
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:11,795
George, I am an old man,
and most people hate me.

1247
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,882
But I don't like them, either,
so that makes it all even.

1248
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,134
You know just as well as I do

1249
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,762
that I run practically everything
in this town

1250
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,431
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1251
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:26,977
You know, also, that for a number of
years I've been trying to get control of it.

1252
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,688
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.

1253
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:31,857
You have been stopping me.

1254
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:36,111
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1255
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:40,699
and as anyone in this county
can tell you, that takes some doing.

1256
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,495
Take during the Depression,
for instance.

1257
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:47,664
You and I were the only ones
that kept our heads.

1258
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:51,710
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.

1259
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:54,463
Yes. Well, most people say
you stole all the rest.

1260
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,841
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.

1261
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:02,888
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.

1262
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,390
Now let's look at your side.

1263
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:13,232
Young man, 27-28, married,
making, say, $40 a week.

1264
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:15,275
- $45.
- $45.

1265
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,485
$45.

1266
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,739
Out of which, after supporting
your mother and paying your bills,

1267
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:23,909
you're able to keep, say, $10,
if you skimp.

1268
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:28,330
A child or two comes along, and you
won't even be able to save the $10.

1269
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:33,961
Now, if this young man of 28
was a common, ordinary yokel,

1270
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:35,629
I'd say he was doing fine.

1271
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:40,008
But George Bailey is not a common,
ordinary yokel.

1272
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:43,762
He is an intelligent, smart,
ambitious young man,

1273
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:47,057
who hates his job,
who hates the Building and Loan

1274
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,809
almost as much as I do.

1275
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:54,106
A young man who's been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born.

1276
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,359
A young man... The smartest one
of the crowd, mind you.

1277
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,027
A young man who has to sit by

1278
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,573
and watch his friends go places
because he's trapped.

1279
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:06,326
Yes, sir,
trapped into frittering his life away,

1280
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,996
playing nursemaid
to a lot of garlic eaters.

1281
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,792
Do I paint a correct picture,
or do I exaggerate?

1282
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,797
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?

1283
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,466
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1284
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,803
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs,
run my properties.

1285
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:30,142
George, I'll start you out
at $20,000 a year.

1286
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,940
$20,000 a year?

1287
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:40,402
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1288
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,196
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1289
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:46,074
a couple of business trips
to New York a year,

1290
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,993
maybe once in a while Europe.

1291
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,411
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, George?

1292
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:50,829
Would I?

1293
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,168
You're not talking to somebody else
around here, are you?

1294
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,961
You know, this is me.
You remember me?

1295
01:10:58,046 --> 01:10:59,838
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.

1296
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:03,008
Yeah, George Bailey,
whose ship has just come in.

1297
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:07,512
Provided he has enough brains
to climb aboard.

1298
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,272
Holy mackerel.

1299
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,903
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1300
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,406
Oh, confound it, man,
are you afraid of success?

1301
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:31,453
I'm offering you a three-years contract
at $20,000 a year, starting today.

1302
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,246
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1303
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,541
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1304
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:40,545
I know I ought to jump
at the chance but I... I just...

1305
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:45,717
I wonder if it would be possible for you
to give me 24 hours to think it over?

1306
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,469
Sure, sure, sure.

1307
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,138
You go on home
and talk about it to your wife.

1308
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,765
I'd like to do that.

1309
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,184
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.

1310
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,186
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1311
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,231
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1312
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:11,702
No. No. No, no,
now wait a minute, here.

1313
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,414
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.

1314
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:19,251
I know right now, and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!

1315
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,795
You sit around here,
and you spin your little webs,

1316
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,339
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money.

1317
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:26,008
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1318
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,261
In the whole vast configuration of things,

1319
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,139
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

1320
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,223
You...

1321
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,810
And that goes for you, too!

1322
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,983
And it goes for you, too!

1323
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,993
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1324
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:56,038
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1325
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,791
going to New York on a business trip
a couple of times a year,

1326
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,127
maybe Europe once in a while.

1327
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,213
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

1328
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:08,508
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

1329
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,720
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

1330
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,638
and I'm gonna see the world.

1331
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,475
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.

1332
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:19,144
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

1333
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,646
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.

1334
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:26,068
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?

1335
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,071
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

1336
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:30,906
and pull her down for you.

1337
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:33,617
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?

1338
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:36,578
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?

1339
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,623
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight

1340
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,416
And

1341
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

1342
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,556
Mary Hatch,

1343
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,853
why in the world
did you ever marry a guy like me?

1344
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,524
To keep from being an old maid.

1345
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,442
You could have
married Sam Wainwright

1346
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,236
and anybody else in town.

1347
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,322
I didn't want
to marry anybody else in town.

1348
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,367
I want my baby to look like you.

1349
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,536
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1350
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,995
I promised you...

1351
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:22,124
- Your what?
- My baby.

1352
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,378
Your... Your...

1353
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:28,964
Mary, you on the nest?

1354
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:33,135
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!

1355
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:41,059
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?

1356
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:49,192
Now, you've probably already guessed
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1357
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:53,029
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.

1358
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,824
Then she had another one, a girl.

1359
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,118
Day after day she worked away,

1360
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,121
remaking the old Granville house
into a home.

1361
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,916
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.

1362
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,881
Potter was bearing down hard.

1363
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,721
Then came a war.

1364
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:22,100
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch
joined the Red Cross and sewed.

1365
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,688
Mary had two more babies
but still found time to run the USO.

1366
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:30,442
Sam Wainwright made a fortune
in plastic hoods for planes.

1367
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,153
Potter became head of the draft board.

1368
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:41,328
One-A.

1369
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:44,122
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1370
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:48,585
Bert the cop was wounded
in North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1371
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:52,422
Ernie the taxi driver
parachuted into France.

1372
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,926
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

1373
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,385
Harry...

1374
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,804
Harry Bailey topped them all.

1375
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:03,808
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes,

1376
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:08,230
two of them as they were about
to crash into a transport full of soldiers.

1377
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,234
- Yes, but George.
- George?

1378
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:14,402
Four-F on account of his ear,

1379
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,988
George fought the battle
of Bedford Falls.

1380
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,824
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!

1381
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,451
Don't you know there's a war on?

1382
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:23,328
Air raid warden.

1383
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,546
Paper drives.

1384
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:34,965
Scrap drives.

1385
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,466
Rubber drives.

1386
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:41,596
Like everybody else on VE Day,
he wept and prayed.

1387
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,726
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.

1388
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,979
Joseph, now show him
what happened today.

1389
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:50,021
Yes, sir.

1390
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,942
This morning, day before Christmas,
about 10:00 a.m.

1391
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,610
Bedford Falls time...

1392
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:57,988
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.

1393
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:04,494
It's gonna snow again.

1394
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:07,872
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines. The President...

1395
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,417
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.

1396
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,002
Commander Harry Bailey!

1397
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,629
Mr. Gower, look at this,
the second page.

1398
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:15,964
Now, look, this is for you.

1399
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,465
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.

1400
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,384
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.

1401
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,179
Be sure you spell the name right.

1402
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:35,817
Extra! Read all about it!

1403
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,361
George, George! It's Harry now
on long-distance from Washington.

1404
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:39,988
Harry! What do you know about that!

1405
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,573
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?

1406
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,950
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.

1407
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:45,410
Harry!

1408
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:49,581
You old seven times
a son of a gun. Congratulations.

1409
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:52,250
How's Mother standing it? She did?

1410
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:53,835
What do you know?

1411
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,628
Mother had lunch
with the President's wife.

1412
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:56,796
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1413
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,007
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?

1414
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,133
Harry,

1415
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,345
you should see what they're cooking up
in the town for you.

1416
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:04,512
Oh, they are?

1417
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:06,473
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home
this afternoon.

1418
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:07,682
In a plane?

1419
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:10,185
What? Uncle Billy?

1420
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,645
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.

1421
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:16,191
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.

1422
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,317
- George. George, George.
- What?

1423
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:18,526
- That man is here again.
- What man?

1424
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,195
Bank examiner.

1425
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,406
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute,
will you?

1426
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:24,699
I'll be right back.

1427
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,242
- Well...
- Harry.

1428
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,828
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.

1429
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:31,039
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1430
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,874
We're all excited around here.

1431
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,043
My brother just got
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1432
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,879
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.

1433
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,799
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?

1434
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:44,135
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1435
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,012
Yeah, very funny.

1436
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,975
Well, now,
come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1437
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,311
Although I shouldn't wonder
when you okay reverse charges

1438
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:55,146
on personal long-distance calls.

1439
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,815
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.

1440
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,566
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.

1441
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,403
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.

1442
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,364
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

1443
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:05,698
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1444
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,075
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.

1445
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:11,162
December 24.

1446
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,337
$8,000.

1447
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,049
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.

1448
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:26,553
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?

1449
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:30,390
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey
wins Congressional Medal."

1450
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,559
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.

1451
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:36,229
You just can't keep those Baileys down,
now can you, Mr. Potter?

1452
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:38,731
How does slacker George
feel about that?

1453
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:40,066
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1454
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:42,360
He only lost three buttons off his vest.

1455
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,487
Of course,
slacker George would've gotten

1456
01:19:44,572 --> 01:19:46,448
two of these medals if he had gone.

1457
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,074
- Bad ear.
- Yes.

1458
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:51,703
After all, Potter, some people
like George had to stay at home.

1459
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:55,832
Not every heel was
in Germany and Japan.

1460
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:06,843
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1461
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:10,638
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1462
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,557
- You forgot something.
- What?

1463
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,142
Well, aren't you going
to make a deposit?

1464
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,226
Oh, sure, sure I am.

1465
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:18,730
Well, then, it's usually customary
to bring the money with you.

1466
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:23,485
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

1467
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,405
How about that finger there?

1468
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,573
Well, I...

1469
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,658
Bailey.

1470
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,584
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1471
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,922
Come on, look sharp.

1472
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,107
Take me back.

1473
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:16,287
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.
I got those books for you here.

1474
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,789
Oh, hello, Vi.

1475
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,457
George, can I see you for a second?

1476
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:22,418
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.

1477
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,421
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

1478
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:29,008
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.

1479
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,218
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1480
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,053
You know, your nephew,
remember? Harry.

1481
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,388
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.

1482
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,642
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.

1483
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,353
I ought to have my head examined.

1484
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,314
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.

1485
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,738
Here you are.

1486
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,407
Character?

1487
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,325
If I had any character, I'd...

1488
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:57,829
It takes a lot of character to leave
your hometown and start all over again.

1489
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,414
No, George, don't.

1490
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,499
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?

1491
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,209
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do,

1492
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:05,086
hock your furs and that hat?

1493
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,922
You want to walk to New York?

1494
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,799
You know, they charge
for meals and rent up there,

1495
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,301
just the same as they do
in Bedford Falls.

1496
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,177
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.

1497
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,763
That's my business, Building and Loan.

1498
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,975
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.

1499
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,227
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1500
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,193
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.

1501
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,195
Now, let's hear from you
once in a while.

1502
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:38,453
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1503
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:41,831
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.

1504
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:43,416
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?

1505
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,001
Yeah, he's in his office.

1506
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,295
What's going on?

1507
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,505
The bank examiner's here.

1508
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:53,217
- He's here?
- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...

1509
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:54,927
What's the matter with you?

1510
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,429
Come here.

1511
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,659
Eustace.

1512
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,494
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.

1513
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:23,498
Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

1514
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:26,084
He had it on his desk counting it
before he closed up.

1515
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,836
Now, look, did you buy anything?

1516
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,214
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1517
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,925
Now, we'll go over every step you took
since you left the house.

1518
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,009
- Right. This way.
- Come on.

1519
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,938
And did you put the envelope
in your pocket?

1520
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,149
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1521
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:53,027
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!

1522
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:54,654
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look,

1523
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,323
do you realize what's going
to happen if we don't find it?

1524
01:23:57,408 --> 01:23:58,449
Listen to me.

1525
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,326
Do you have any secret hiding place
here in the house?

1526
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:02,453
Someplace you would have...
Someplace you hide the money?

1527
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,163
I've gone over the whole house,

1528
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:08,167
even in rooms that have been locked
since I lost Laura.

1529
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:11,379
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!

1530
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:15,550
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.

1531
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:18,553
Where's that money,
you silly, stupid old fool?

1532
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,389
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?

1533
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,475
It means bankruptcy and scandal
and prison!

1534
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:26,894
That's what it means.

1535
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:30,231
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.

1536
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:54,088
Hello, darling.

1537
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:55,965
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.

1538
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:57,925
How do you like it?

1539
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,677
- Bless you!
- Bless you!

1540
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:02,597
Did you bring the wreath?

1541
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,515
Yes, Daddy, did you bring
the Christmas wreath?

1542
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,600
What wreath?

1543
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,144
The Merry Christmas wreath
for the window.

1544
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:09,562
No. I left it at the office.

1545
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:11,606
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.

1546
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,776
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1547
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,027
What's the matter?

1548
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,696
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.

1549
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:29,665
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.

1550
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,752
Way up at the top. There. That's it.

1551
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:37,173
All right, fill in that little bare spot
right there. Right there.

1552
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:42,887
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.

1553
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:46,724
Bet I had 50 calls today
about the parade, the banquet.

1554
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,976
Your mother's so excited. She...

1555
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:12,083
Must she keep playing that?

1556
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,002
I have to practice it
for the party tonight, Daddy.

1557
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,172
Mama said we could stay up
till midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1558
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:19,757
Can you sing, Daddy?

1559
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,717
Better hurry and shave.

1560
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:24,762
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.

1561
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:27,306
I don't want the families over here.

1562
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:32,144
Come on out in the kitchen with me
while I finish dinner.

1563
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:35,314
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1564
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,567
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.

1565
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,570
Another big red-letter day
for the Baileys.

1566
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,865
Daddy, the Browns next door
have a new car. You should see it.

1567
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,200
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?

1568
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,368
Yes, Daddy.

1569
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,037
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1570
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,373
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.

1571
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:54,876
All right, darling, you're excused.

1572
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,712
Now, go on upstairs
and see if little Zuzu wants anything.

1573
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:02,550
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?
- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.

1574
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,093
Caught it coming home from school.

1575
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:06,721
They gave her a flower for a prize,
and she didn't want to crush it,

1576
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:08,055
so she didn't button up her coat.

1577
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,308
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.

1578
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,684
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1579
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,519
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1580
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:14,854
He says it's nothing to worry about.

1581
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:16,230
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?

1582
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,399
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.

1583
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:19,942
Of course, it's this old house.

1584
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:22,236
I don't know why
we don't all have pneumonia.

1585
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:26,657
Drafty old barn.
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.

1586
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,618
Why did we have
to live here in the first place

1587
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:31,829
and stay around this measly,
crummy old town?

1588
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:35,207
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.

1589
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,586
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?

1590
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,340
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.

1591
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,175
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zuzu.

1592
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,677
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

1593
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:01,275
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

1594
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:02,860
Hi, Daddy!

1595
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:07,198
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1596
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,325
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?

1597
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,077
I want to give my flower a drink.

1598
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,371
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.

1599
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,789
I'll give it a drink.

1600
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,207
Now, here.

1601
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,794
Look, Daddy!

1602
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,295
Paste it!

1603
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,923
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.

1604
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,928
Now, we'll paste this together here.

1605
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,309
There. There it is. Good as new.

1606
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:37,478
Now, give the flower a drink.

1607
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,021
Now, will you do something for me?

1608
01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:41,857
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?

1609
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:44,986
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.

1610
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:49,490
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep
and then you can dream about it,

1611
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:51,951
and it'll be a whole garden.

1612
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,285
It will?

1613
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:03,504
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

1614
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,006
I'll get it.

1615
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,092
Hello?

1616
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:11,053
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1617
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:14,306
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1618
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,017
The doctor said
that she ought to be out of bed

1619
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,309
in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1620
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:18,936
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1621
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:20,354
Let me speak to her.

1622
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,898
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1623
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,735
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.

1624
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,528
Say, what kind of a teacher
are you, anyway?

1625
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:29,905
What do you mean
sending her home like that, half naked?

1626
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:32,533
Do you realize she'll probably end up
with pneumonia on account of you?

1627
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,577
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for

1628
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,787
to have teachers like you?

1629
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:40,124
Stupid, silly, careless people who send
our kids home without any clothes on?

1630
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,043
You know, maybe my kids
aren't the best-dressed kids.

1631
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,878
And maybe they don't have
any decent clothes...

1632
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,755
That stupid...

1633
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:49,383
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...

1634
01:29:49,468 --> 01:29:51,594
Hello? Hello.

1635
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,765
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!

1636
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:59,060
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?

1637
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,936
Hello! Who's this?

1638
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:02,563
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1639
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,398
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1640
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,567
Give me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.

1641
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:07,693
George, stop it.

1642
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:09,487
Will you get out and let me handle this?

1643
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,114
Hello? Hello? What?

1644
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,409
Oh, you will, huh?

1645
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,412
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time
you think you're man enough, you...

1646
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:19,997
Hello! Any...

1647
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:25,127
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?

1648
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:27,254
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?

1649
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:28,589
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1650
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,549
Janie, haven't you learned
that silly tune yet?

1651
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:34,345
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!

1652
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,082
I'm sorry, Mary.

1653
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,254
Janie, I'm sorry.

1654
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:13,092
I didn't mean that. I...
You go on and practice.

1655
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,016
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1656
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:23,644
I'm sorry.

1657
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,898
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.

1658
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,657
What's the matter with everybody?

1659
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,285
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!

1660
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:40,703
Oh, Daddy!

1661
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:49,545
George, why must you
torture the children? Why don't you...

1662
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:51,547
Mary...

1663
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:07,521
Bedford 247, please.

1664
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:09,648
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1665
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:12,818
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1666
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:14,945
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1667
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:17,907
Hello? Uncle Billy?

1668
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,242
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1669
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,203
I need help.

1670
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:26,165
Through some sort of an accident,
my company's short in their accounts.

1671
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:28,042
The bank examiner got there today.

1672
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:30,377
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.

1673
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,922
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted
to talk to you about?

1674
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,340
- The reporters?
- Yes.

1675
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:37,801
They called me up
from your Building and Loan.

1676
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:41,472
Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1677
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,765
He's looking for you.

1678
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:46,477
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?

1679
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,395
Can't you see what it means
to my family?

1680
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,315
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan,
any interest,

1681
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,983
if you still want the Building and Loan...

1682
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:56,570
George, could it possibly be there's
a slight discrepancy in the books?

1683
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:58,197
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.

1684
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:01,283
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.

1685
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:05,329
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.

1686
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,044
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.

1687
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:16,215
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.

1688
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,592
What've you been doing, George?

1689
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:20,386
Playing the market
with the company's money?

1690
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,595
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.

1691
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,681
Is it a woman, then?

1692
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:27,351
You know, it's all over town that
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1693
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,477
What?

1694
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:31,272
Not that it makes any difference to me,
but why did you come to me?

1695
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:34,108
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright
and ask him for the money?

1696
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,776
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.

1697
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,278
Well, what about all your other friends?

1698
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:39,697
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.

1699
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,699
You're the only one in town
that can help me.

1700
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:46,203
I've suddenly become quite important.

1701
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,707
What kind of security
would I have, George?

1702
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:53,127
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1703
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:56,046
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?

1704
01:33:56,548 --> 01:34:00,759
I have some life insurance,
a $15,000 policy.

1705
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:04,555
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.

1706
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:06,557
Five hundred dollars?

1707
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:09,601
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?

1708
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:14,273
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.

1709
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:17,693
You were going to go out
and conquer the world.

1710
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:23,032
You once called me a warped,
frustrated old man.

1711
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:27,077
What are you but a warped,
frustrated young man?

1712
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,246
A miserable little clerk,

1713
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:30,998
crawling in here
on your hands and knees

1714
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:32,958
and begging for help.

1715
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:35,085
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.

1716
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:38,839
Nothing but a miserable
little $500 equity

1717
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,091
in a life insurance policy.

1718
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:44,345
You're worth more dead than alive.

1719
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:47,806
Why don't you go to the riffraff
you love so much

1720
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,434
and ask them to let you have $8,000?

1721
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:52,061
You know why?

1722
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:54,855
Because they'd run you
out of town on a rail.

1723
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:58,150
But I tell you
what I'm going to do for you, George.

1724
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:01,403
Since the state examiner is still here,

1725
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:04,031
as a stockholder
of the Building and Loan,

1726
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:07,076
I'm going to swear out
a warrant for your arrest.

1727
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:11,497
Misappropriation of funds,
manipulation, malfeasance.

1728
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,501
All right, George, go ahead.

1729
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:18,462
You can't hide in a little town like this.

1730
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,923
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.

1731
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:37,981
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!

1732
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:40,192
How about some of that good spaghetti?

1733
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,985
We got everything.

1734
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:58,919
Oh, God.

1735
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,843
Dear Father in Heaven,

1736
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,973
I'm not a praying man,

1737
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:15,060
but if you're up there
and you can hear me,

1738
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,313
show me the way.

1739
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,108
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

1740
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,987
Show me the way, O God.

1741
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:33,537
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?

1742
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,584
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1743
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:42,045
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.

1744
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:45,048
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1745
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:47,718
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1746
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:54,808
The next time you talk to my wife
like that, you'll get worse!

1747
01:36:54,893 --> 01:36:56,226
She cried for an hour!

1748
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:59,480
It isn't enough she slaves teaching
your stupid kids how to read and write,

1749
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:02,107
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1750
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,650
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.

1751
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:05,402
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!

1752
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:08,447
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!

1753
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:16,413
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?

1754
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,917
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.

1755
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:22,794
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.

1756
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,796
That's what I get for praying.

1757
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,924
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?

1758
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:28,133
Yes, you bet.

1759
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:31,637
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.

1760
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,430
Oh, no, please,
don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.

1761
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:35,182
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.

1762
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,642
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.

1763
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,810
Please no go away, please!

1764
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:59,623
What do you think you're doing?

1765
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:05,587
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree!

1766
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,465
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1767
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:12,970
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!

1768
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:24,481
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.

1769
01:39:11,321 --> 01:39:12,446
Help!

1770
01:39:14,032 --> 01:39:22,039
Help! Help!

1771
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,293
Help!

1772
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:33,133
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1773
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:41,600
Help! Help!

1774
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,827
I didn't have time
to get some stylish underwear.

1775
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:03,705
Wife gave me this
on my last birthday.

1776
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:06,124
I passed away in it.

1777
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:12,589
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1778
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,221
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

1779
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:21,765
How did you happen to fall in?

1780
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:25,018
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.

1781
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:28,230
You what? To save me?

1782
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:31,525
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?

1783
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:33,735
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1784
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,905
It's against the law
to commit suicide around here.

1785
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,825
Yeah, it's against the law
where I come from, too.

1786
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:42,285
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1787
01:40:47,417 --> 01:40:50,419
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.

1788
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:52,921
I knew if I were drowning,
you'd try to save me.

1789
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:55,966
You see, you did,
and that's how I saved you.

1790
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,093
Very funny.

1791
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:00,387
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1792
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:04,558
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw
in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1793
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:08,478
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.

1794
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:10,897
That's why I was sent down here.

1795
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:14,651
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.

1796
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:16,570
I've watched you grow up
from a little boy.

1797
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,071
What are you,
a mind reader or something?

1798
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:19,281
No.

1799
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:23,326
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.

1800
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:25,328
Oddbody?

1801
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:28,498
AS2? What's that, AS2?

1802
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,500
Angel Second Class.

1803
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:42,679
Cheerio, my good man.

1804
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:48,268
Oh, brother.

1805
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:51,855
Gee whiz.

1806
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:55,692
I wonder what Martini
put in those drinks.

1807
01:41:57,737 --> 01:42:02,282
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?

1808
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,201
Why'd you want to save me?

1809
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:07,871
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.

1810
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:10,415
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1811
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:14,836
Ridiculous of you to think
of killing yourself for money, $8,000.

1812
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:17,964
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?

1813
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:22,093
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.

1814
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:26,223
Well, you look about
like the kind of an angel I'd get.

1815
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:29,267
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?

1816
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:33,396
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.

1817
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:39,236
I don't know whether I'd like it very much

1818
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,279
being seen around
with an angel without any wings.

1819
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:44,991
Oh, I've got to earn them,
and you'll help me, won't you?

1820
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:46,451
Sure, sure.

1821
01:42:46,953 --> 01:42:49,579
- How?
- By letting me help you.

1822
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:52,582
Yes. Only one way you can help me.

1823
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:54,626
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?

1824
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,170
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.

1825
01:42:57,255 --> 01:42:59,798
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1826
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:04,135
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1827
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,430
I found it out a little late.

1828
01:43:07,807 --> 01:43:09,850
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1829
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:14,104
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1830
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:17,858
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...

1831
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,652
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1832
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,946
My wife and my kids and my friends.

1833
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:26,283
I mean, look, little fellow, go off
and haunt somebody else, will you?

1834
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:29,035
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...

1835
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,954
Oh, shut up, will you?

1836
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:37,544
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1837
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:46,970
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1838
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:51,558
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.

1839
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:55,729
I suppose it would have been better
if I'd never been born at all.

1840
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:59,149
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1841
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:01,860
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1842
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:06,907
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.

1843
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:09,534
What do you think?

1844
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,953
Yeah, that'll do it.

1845
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:13,955
All right.

1846
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,878
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.

1847
01:44:25,468 --> 01:44:28,511
You don't have
to make all that fuss about it!

1848
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:30,805
What did you say?

1849
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:34,768
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.

1850
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:38,104
No worries, no obligations,
no $8,000 to get,

1851
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:40,065
no Potter looking for you
with the Sheriff.

1852
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:43,610
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.

1853
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:45,820
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1854
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:48,448
I haven't heard anything out of that ear
since I was a kid.

1855
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:50,700
Must have been that jump
in that cold water.

1856
01:44:50,785 --> 01:44:53,536
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.

1857
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:01,920
What do you know about that?
What's happening?

1858
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:05,674
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?

1859
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:07,550
What's happened here?

1860
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,178
What I need
is a couple of good stiff drinks.

1861
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:12,555
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?

1862
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:16,309
Come on,
soon as these clothes of ours are dry...

1863
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:18,353
The clothes are dry.

1864
01:45:18,437 --> 01:45:21,606
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1865
01:45:21,691 --> 01:45:25,819
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...

1866
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:28,071
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

1867
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:29,698
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

1868
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:32,492
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.

1869
01:45:38,124 --> 01:45:39,499
What's the matter?

1870
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,293
Well, this is where I left my car,
and it isn't here.

1871
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:45,672
- You have no car.
- Well, I had a car, and it was right here.

1872
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,298
I guess somebody moved it.

1873
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:51,469
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?

1874
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:53,847
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1875
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,182
I'm the fellow that owns the car
that ran into your tree.

1876
01:45:56,267 --> 01:45:58,309
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?

1877
01:45:58,394 --> 01:46:00,478
This tree. Here, I ran into it.

1878
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:03,773
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.

1879
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:11,573
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.

1880
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:13,867
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.

1881
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:15,118
Pottersville?

1882
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:16,828
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1883
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:20,457
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?

1884
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,709
What's the matter with you?

1885
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:26,004
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...

1886
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:32,886
Oh, I don't know.
Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.

1887
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:35,221
It isn't me.

1888
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,348
Well, maybe I left the car
up at Martini's.

1889
01:46:37,433 --> 01:46:39,768
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.

1890
01:46:39,852 --> 01:46:41,644
Clarence. Clarence.

1891
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:50,945
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.

1892
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:53,990
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.

1893
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:03,875
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
- Want a martini?

1894
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:06,002
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?

1895
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:08,505
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?

1896
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:10,799
Okay, all right. Double bourbon,
will you, and quick, huh?

1897
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:12,133
Okay.

1898
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:18,348
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.

1899
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:21,935
It's been so long since I...

1900
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:25,688
Look, mister, I'm standing here
waiting for you to make up your mind.

1901
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:27,398
That's a good man.

1902
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:29,651
I was just thinking

1903
01:47:30,528 --> 01:47:33,696
of a flaming rum punch.

1904
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:36,574
No, it's not cold enough for that,
not nearly cold enough.

1905
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:39,619
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.

1906
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:43,289
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon
and light on the cloves.

1907
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:45,291
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1908
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:48,419
Hey, look, mister,
we serve hard drinks in here

1909
01:47:48,504 --> 01:47:50,296
for men who want to get drunk fast.

1910
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:53,925
And we don't need any characters
around to give the joint atmosphere.

1911
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,637
Is that clear, or do I have
to slip you my left for a convincer?

1912
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,097
What's he talking about?

1913
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:03,059
Nick, Nick,
just give him the same as mine.

1914
01:48:03,144 --> 01:48:05,478
- He's okay.
- Okay.

1915
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:10,483
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1916
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:13,695
You'll see a lot of strange things
from now on.

1917
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:15,738
Oh, yeah.

1918
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:22,537
Hey, little fellow,
you worry me, you know.

1919
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:25,582
- You got someplace to sleep?
- No.

1920
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:27,208
You don't, huh?

1921
01:48:27,293 --> 01:48:29,919
- Well, you got any money?
- No.

1922
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,505
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1923
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:36,259
I jumped in the river to save you
so I could get my wings.

1924
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:42,223
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1925
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:47,103
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means
that some angel's just got his wings.

1926
01:48:54,987 --> 01:48:57,739
Look, I think maybe you
better not mention

1927
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:59,199
getting your wings around here.

1928
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:01,701
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1929
01:49:04,288 --> 01:49:06,122
Yeah, they believe in them.

1930
01:49:06,207 --> 01:49:09,500
Oh, why should they be surprised
when they see one?

1931
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:14,547
Oh, he never grew up. He's...

1932
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:18,968
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three,

1933
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,472
next May.

1934
01:49:23,057 --> 01:49:25,683
That does it. Out, you two pixies!

1935
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:27,727
Go through the door or out the window.

1936
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,896
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.

1937
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,940
Where do you come off
calling me Nick?

1938
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:33,524
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1939
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:37,737
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1940
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:40,698
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.

1941
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:47,747
Didn't I tell you never to come
panhandling around here, huh?

1942
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:58,758
Mr. Gower.

1943
01:50:00,386 --> 01:50:02,136
What... What did...

1944
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,931
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.

1945
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:08,434
- Don't you know me?
- No.

1946
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,229
No.

1947
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:12,772
Throw him out. Throw him out.

1948
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:14,857
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...

1949
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:18,278
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1950
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,613
You know, that's another reason
for me not to like you.

1951
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:24,117
That rum head spent 20 years in jail
for poisoning a kid.

1952
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:27,078
If you know him,
you must be a jailbird yourself.

1953
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:29,205
Would you show these gentlemen
to the door?

1954
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:31,332
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1955
01:50:36,755 --> 01:50:38,047
Stay out.

1956
01:50:39,216 --> 01:50:41,801
Get me! I'm giving out wings!

1957
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:46,973
You see, George,
you were not there to stop Gower

1958
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,766
from putting that poison
into the capsules.

1959
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:52,520
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...

1960
01:50:54,732 --> 01:50:57,150
Hey, what's going on around here?

1961
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:58,776
What...

1962
01:50:59,903 --> 01:51:02,572
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1963
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:10,121
Look, who are you?

1964
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:12,915
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.

1965
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,251
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

1966
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:24,093
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?

1967
01:51:24,178 --> 01:51:25,345
No. Of course not.

1968
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:28,014
Well, then, why am I seeing
all these strange things here?

1969
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:32,518
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.

1970
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:36,898
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.

1971
01:51:36,982 --> 01:51:39,650
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.

1972
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:41,778
There is no George Bailey.

1973
01:51:42,905 --> 01:51:47,241
You have no papers, no cards,
no driver's license,

1974
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:50,411
no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1975
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:53,414
They're not there, either.

1976
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,959
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

1977
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:05,176
You've been given a great gift, George,

1978
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:08,971
a chance to see what the world
would be like without you.

1979
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:13,935
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.

1980
01:52:15,813 --> 01:52:19,148
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.

1981
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:21,109
So long, mister. I'm going home.

1982
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:24,070
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!

1983
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:28,616
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.

1984
01:52:29,034 --> 01:52:31,744
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.

1985
01:52:31,829 --> 01:52:33,746
I'm going home
and see my wife and family.

1986
01:52:33,831 --> 01:52:36,999
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.

1987
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:41,295
How am I doing, Joseph?

1988
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,214
Thanks.

1989
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:45,633
No, I didn't have a drink.

1990
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:39,395
Hey, hey, where did
the Building and Loan move to?

1991
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,480
Building and what?

1992
01:53:40,564 --> 01:53:42,315
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.

1993
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:44,275
They went out of business years ago.

1994
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:45,735
That sailor's a liar!

1995
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:48,112
I know every big shot in this town!

1996
01:53:48,197 --> 01:53:50,740
I know Potter,
and I'll have you kicked off the beat.

1997
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:52,283
Hey, Violet!

1998
01:53:53,494 --> 01:53:56,078
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.

1999
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:58,289
- I know.
- I know that girl!

2000
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:00,166
Take a walk. Beat it.

2001
01:54:02,169 --> 01:54:03,920
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.

2002
01:54:06,089 --> 01:54:08,007
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.

2003
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:09,091
Where do you live?

2004
01:54:09,176 --> 01:54:11,260
Now, doggone it, Ernie,
don't you start pulling that stuff.

2005
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:13,846
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.

2006
01:54:13,931 --> 01:54:17,391
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

2007
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:19,310
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

2008
01:54:19,937 --> 01:54:21,979
Come on, Ernie,
now straighten me out here.

2009
01:54:22,064 --> 01:54:25,066
Look, I've got some bad liquor
or something. Listen to me.

2010
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:26,359
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

2011
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:28,194
and you live in Bailey Park
with your wife and kid?

2012
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:30,321
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?

2013
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:33,658
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.

2014
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:36,536
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field,

2015
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,663
my wife ran away three years ago
and took the kid,

2016
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:41,207
and I ain't never seen you
before in my life, see?

2017
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,085
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!

2018
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:03,896
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.

2019
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:07,191
Well, this house ain't been lived in
for 20 years.

2020
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,241
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.

2021
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:18,494
But we better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.

2022
01:55:35,971 --> 01:55:38,180
Mary. Mary!

2023
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:44,020
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
Where are you?

2024
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:47,106
They're not here, George.
You have no children.

2025
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,608
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

2026
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:50,860
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.

2027
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:52,528
Come on out here, both of you.

2028
01:55:52,613 --> 01:55:54,947
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.

2029
01:55:55,032 --> 01:55:58,284
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

2030
01:55:58,368 --> 01:56:00,036
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.

2031
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,163
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?

2032
01:56:02,247 --> 01:56:03,748
You were here on my wedding night.

2033
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:05,458
You, both of you,
stood out there on the porch

2034
01:56:05,542 --> 01:56:07,835
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.

2035
01:56:07,919 --> 01:56:09,253
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid,

2036
01:56:09,338 --> 01:56:10,463
and we'll take you in to a doctor?

2037
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:12,506
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.

2038
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:14,467
Ernie, will you take me over
to my mother's house?

2039
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:17,011
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.

2040
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:20,556
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...

2041
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:24,602
Run, George! Run, George! Run!

2042
01:56:26,313 --> 01:56:29,106
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.

2043
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:32,068
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!

2044
01:56:37,866 --> 01:56:41,160
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.

2045
01:56:43,914 --> 01:56:45,456
I need a drink.

2046
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:48,584
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.

2047
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:59,595
Well?

2048
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:04,058
Mother.

2049
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:08,104
Mother? What do you want?

2050
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:11,941
Mother, this is George.

2051
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:14,068
I thought sure you'd remember me.

2052
01:57:14,152 --> 01:57:15,569
George who?

2053
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:17,530
If you're looking for a room,
there's no vacancy.

2054
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:20,950
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.

2055
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:23,452
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.

2056
01:57:23,537 --> 01:57:26,497
Please let me come in,
and keep me here until I get over it.

2057
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:28,916
Get over what? I don't take in strangers

2058
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,544
unless they're sent here
by somebody I know.

2059
01:57:31,878 --> 01:57:36,882
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2060
01:57:36,967 --> 01:57:38,676
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2061
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,886
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2062
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:42,096
It's a lie.

2063
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:45,057
He's been in the insane asylum
ever since he lost his business.

2064
01:57:45,142 --> 01:57:48,018
And if you ask me,
that's where you belong.

2065
01:57:59,948 --> 01:58:01,615
Strange, isn't it?

2066
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:04,994
Each man's life
touches so many other lives.

2067
01:58:05,454 --> 01:58:08,414
And when he isn't around,
he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2068
01:58:08,498 --> 01:58:09,665
I've heard of things like this.

2069
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,500
You got me in some kind of a spell
or something.

2070
01:58:11,585 --> 01:58:13,669
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.

2071
01:58:13,754 --> 01:58:15,546
I know how, too. I...

2072
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,089
The last man I talked to,

2073
01:58:17,174 --> 01:58:19,341
before all this stuff
started happening to me, was Martini.

2074
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:20,634
You know where he lives?

2075
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:23,637
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.

2076
01:58:27,225 --> 01:58:31,687
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2077
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:35,399
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.

2078
01:58:36,193 --> 01:58:39,945
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.

2079
01:58:44,534 --> 01:58:47,536
Your brother Harry Bailey
broke through the ice

2080
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:49,497
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2081
01:58:49,581 --> 01:58:51,665
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.

2082
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:53,209
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

2083
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:55,252
He saved the lives
of every man on that transport.

2084
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:57,379
Every man on that transport died.

2085
01:58:57,464 --> 01:58:58,798
Harry wasn't there to save them,

2086
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:01,592
because you weren't there
to save Harry.

2087
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:16,315
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.

2088
01:59:16,775 --> 01:59:20,861
Don't you see what a mistake
it would be to throw it away?

2089
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:23,447
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?

2090
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:27,660
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...

2091
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:30,287
I don't know how you know these things,
but tell me, where is she?

2092
01:59:30,372 --> 01:59:32,331
If you know where she is,
tell me where my wife is.

2093
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:35,417
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.

2094
01:59:35,502 --> 01:59:37,837
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?

2095
01:59:37,921 --> 01:59:40,256
She's an old maid. She never married.

2096
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:42,675
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?

2097
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:45,678
She's just about to close up the library!

2098
01:59:49,558 --> 01:59:52,935
There must be some easier way
for me to get my wings.

2099
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:15,833
Mary!

2100
02:00:17,252 --> 02:00:18,794
Mary! Mary!

2101
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:21,714
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?

2102
02:00:21,798 --> 02:00:23,132
I don't know you. Let me go!

2103
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:26,260
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.

2104
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:28,512
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.

2105
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:30,973
Help me, Mary!

2106
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:32,850
Mary! Let me go!

2107
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:34,852
Help! It's a wild man!

2108
02:00:36,104 --> 02:00:38,772
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!

2109
02:00:38,857 --> 02:00:41,442
Tom! Ed! Charlie!

2110
02:00:42,152 --> 02:00:43,485
That's my wife!

2111
02:00:46,031 --> 02:00:47,573
- Mary!
- No, you don't.

2112
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:48,741
Somebody call the police.

2113
02:00:48,825 --> 02:00:50,159
Somebody hit him on the head
with a bottle.

2114
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,369
You need a straightjacket.

2115
02:00:53,496 --> 02:00:54,788
Clarence!

2116
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:56,832
Get out of here!

2117
02:00:56,917 --> 02:00:58,167
Clarence!

2118
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:02,338
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!

2119
02:01:05,467 --> 02:01:06,842
Stand back!

2120
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:22,316
Clarence!

2121
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:29,490
Clarence! Clarence!

2122
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:32,826
Help me, Clarence!

2123
02:01:33,954 --> 02:01:35,371
Get me back!

2124
02:01:36,206 --> 02:01:39,166
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.

2125
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:41,877
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2126
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:44,129
Help me, Clarence, please.

2127
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:49,259
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.

2128
02:01:51,012 --> 02:01:55,015
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.

2129
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,484
Hey, George!

2130
02:02:06,903 --> 02:02:08,070
George!

2131
02:02:09,114 --> 02:02:11,156
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2132
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:13,659
Now get out of here, Bert,
or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!

2133
02:02:13,743 --> 02:02:15,494
What the sam hill
are you yelling for, George?

2134
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:17,079
You...

2135
02:02:18,415 --> 02:02:21,291
George? Bert, do you know me?

2136
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:23,627
Know you? You kidding?

2137
02:02:23,712 --> 02:02:25,838
I've been looking all over town
trying to find you.

2138
02:02:25,922 --> 02:02:28,882
I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe you...

2139
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:31,218
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?

2140
02:02:31,302 --> 02:02:32,803
What did...

2141
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:39,852
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...

2142
02:02:40,103 --> 02:02:43,188
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!

2143
02:02:43,273 --> 02:02:46,191
Bert! What do you know about that?

2144
02:02:46,276 --> 02:02:50,029
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.

2145
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:53,574
Mary! Mary!

2146
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:04,209
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2147
02:03:07,213 --> 02:03:08,589
Merry Christmas!

2148
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:10,507
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!

2149
02:03:10,592 --> 02:03:12,468
Merry Christmas, George.

2150
02:03:12,552 --> 02:03:14,970
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2151
02:03:15,513 --> 02:03:17,806
Merry Christmas, emporium!

2152
02:03:19,059 --> 02:03:22,770
Merry Christmas,
you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2153
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:30,569
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2154
02:03:30,653 --> 02:03:33,363
Happy New Year to you in jail!

2155
02:03:33,448 --> 02:03:35,491
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2156
02:03:37,077 --> 02:03:40,079
Mary! Mary!

2157
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:42,873
Mary!

2158
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:46,627
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?

2159
02:03:46,711 --> 02:03:48,921
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.

2160
02:03:49,005 --> 02:03:50,464
George, I've got a little paper here.

2161
02:03:50,548 --> 02:03:51,840
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

2162
02:03:51,925 --> 02:03:53,592
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!

2163
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:56,053
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?

2164
02:03:56,137 --> 02:03:58,931
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful,
old drafty house.

2165
02:03:59,015 --> 02:04:01,308
Mary! Mary!

2166
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:03,685
Mary.

2167
02:04:04,437 --> 02:04:06,105
Have you seen my wife?

2168
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:09,066
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

2169
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:11,193
Kids! Pete!

2170
02:04:15,865 --> 02:04:17,116
Kids! Janie!

2171
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:18,700
Janie! Tommy!

2172
02:04:20,829 --> 02:04:23,705
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.

2173
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:25,541
Where's your mother?

2174
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:27,417
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.

2175
02:04:27,502 --> 02:04:29,211
- Daddy!
- Zuzu!

2176
02:04:29,295 --> 02:04:31,839
Zuzu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?

2177
02:04:31,923 --> 02:04:35,217
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...

2178
02:04:35,885 --> 02:04:37,886
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.

2179
02:04:38,596 --> 02:04:41,765
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!

2180
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:44,059
George, darling. Where have you been?

2181
02:04:44,144 --> 02:04:47,479
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.

2182
02:04:47,564 --> 02:04:50,774
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?

2183
02:04:52,235 --> 02:04:54,361
George, George.

2184
02:04:54,445 --> 02:04:56,363
You have no idea
what's happened to me.

2185
02:04:56,447 --> 02:04:58,448
You've no idea what happened...

2186
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:01,451
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.

2187
02:05:01,536 --> 02:05:02,870
- They're on their way.
- All right.

2188
02:05:02,954 --> 02:05:04,204
Come on.

2189
02:05:06,583 --> 02:05:08,375
Come on in here now.

2190
02:05:09,544 --> 02:05:11,170
Now, you stand right over here
by the tree.

2191
02:05:11,254 --> 02:05:13,505
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.

2192
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:15,174
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?

2193
02:05:15,592 --> 02:05:16,925
I hear them coming now.

2194
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:19,428
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.

2195
02:05:19,512 --> 02:05:21,722
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

2196
02:05:21,806 --> 02:05:23,807
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?

2197
02:05:23,892 --> 02:05:27,519
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.

2198
02:05:27,604 --> 02:05:28,854
George.

2199
02:05:30,315 --> 02:05:32,566
Here's everything right here.

2200
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:37,487
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2201
02:05:37,572 --> 02:05:39,156
She told some people
you were in trouble,

2202
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,200
and they scattered all over town
collecting money.

2203
02:05:41,284 --> 02:05:42,367
Didn't ask any questions.

2204
02:05:42,452 --> 02:05:44,161
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."

2205
02:05:44,245 --> 02:05:45,954
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.

2206
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:48,165
...another run on the bank?

2207
02:05:48,249 --> 02:05:50,709
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

2208
02:05:50,793 --> 02:05:52,794
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.

2209
02:05:52,879 --> 02:05:55,047
The line forms on the right.

2210
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:57,049
More coming, George.

2211
02:05:57,133 --> 02:05:59,635
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.

2212
02:06:00,678 --> 02:06:02,304
Merry Christmas.

2213
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:05,057
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.

2214
02:06:05,141 --> 02:06:07,643
Martini! Step right up here.

2215
02:06:08,353 --> 02:06:10,812
I busted the jukebox, too.

2216
02:06:13,983 --> 02:06:15,484
Oh, Mr. Gower!

2217
02:06:17,737 --> 02:06:20,489
I made the rounds
of my charge accounts.

2218
02:06:28,331 --> 02:06:31,375
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.

2219
02:06:31,668 --> 02:06:33,126
Violet Bick.

2220
02:06:33,878 --> 02:06:35,587
Oh, Annie! Annie!

2221
02:06:36,798 --> 02:06:39,091
I've been saving this money
for a divorce,

2222
02:06:39,175 --> 02:06:41,176
if ever I get a husband.

2223
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:43,637
Merry Christmas.

2224
02:06:45,848 --> 02:06:49,184
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up and out of bed.

2225
02:06:49,269 --> 02:06:51,561
Here's something for you to play with.

2226
02:06:53,064 --> 02:06:56,233
I wouldn't have a roof over my head
if it wasn't for you, George.

2227
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:59,820
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

2228
02:06:59,904 --> 02:07:02,114
Now, get this, it's from London.

2229
02:07:03,032 --> 02:07:05,617
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2230
02:07:05,827 --> 02:07:10,122
"My office instructed
to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.

2231
02:07:10,206 --> 02:07:13,208
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."

2232
02:07:23,428 --> 02:07:25,887
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

2233
02:07:31,853 --> 02:07:35,564
Hark the herald angels sing

2234
02:07:35,648 --> 02:07:39,943
Glory to the newborn king

2235
02:07:40,028 --> 02:07:44,364
Peace on earth and mercy mild

2236
02:07:44,449 --> 02:07:48,535
God and sinners reconciled

2237
02:07:48,619 --> 02:07:52,956
Joyful, all ye nations rise

2238
02:07:53,041 --> 02:07:57,127
Join the triumph of the skies

2239
02:07:57,211 --> 02:08:01,340
With angelic host proclaim

2240
02:08:01,424 --> 02:08:05,010
Christ is born in Bethlehem

2241
02:08:05,094 --> 02:08:06,595
Harry Bailey!

2242
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:14,353
George, you old son of a gun.

2243
02:08:14,604 --> 02:08:16,855
Harry. Harry.

2244
02:08:17,106 --> 02:08:18,273
Looks like I got here too late.

2245
02:08:18,358 --> 02:08:20,984
Mary, I got him here from the airport
just as quick as I could.

2246
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:22,861
The fool flew all the way up here
in a blizzard.

2247
02:08:22,945 --> 02:08:24,696
Harry, how about your banquet
in New York?

2248
02:08:24,781 --> 02:08:27,407
Oh, I left right in the middle of it
as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2249
02:08:27,492 --> 02:08:29,493
Good idea, Ernie. A toast

2250
02:08:29,577 --> 02:08:32,871
to my big brother, George,
the richest man in town!

2251
02:08:34,999 --> 02:08:40,462
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2252
02:08:40,546 --> 02:08:46,051
And never brought to mind?

2253
02:08:46,135 --> 02:08:47,803
Should auld acquaintance

2254
02:08:50,807 --> 02:08:51,890
Be forgot

2255
02:08:51,974 --> 02:08:56,395
And days of auld lang syne

2256
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:57,896
Who's that?

2257
02:08:58,981 --> 02:09:02,609
That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.

2258
02:09:03,403 --> 02:09:04,569
Look, Daddy!

2259
02:09:04,654 --> 02:09:10,033
Teacher says every time a bell rings,
an angel gets his wings.

2260
02:09:10,827 --> 02:09:14,329
That's right.

2261
02:09:15,832 --> 02:09:16,998
Attaboy, Clarence.

2262
02:09:17,083 --> 02:09:19,751
Auld lang syne

2263
02:09:19,836 --> 02:09:25,215
For auld lang syne, my dear

2264
02:09:25,299 --> 02:09:30,512
For auld lang syne

2265
02:09:30,596 --> 02:09:36,101
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

2266
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:41,940
For auld lang syne

2267
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:47,779
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

2268
02:09:47,864 --> 02:09:53,368
For auld lang syne
