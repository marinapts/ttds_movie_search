1
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:12,034
Maycomb was a tired old town...

2
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:15,037
even in 1932, when I first knew it.

3
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,582
Some how it was hotter then.

4
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:23,295
Men's stiff collars
wilted by 9:00 in the morning.

5
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,300
Ladies bathed before noon,
after their 3:00 naps...

6
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,844
and by nightfall
were like soft tea cakes...

7
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,639
with frostin 's of sweat
and sweet talcum.

8
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:39,269
A day was 24 hours long,
but it seemed longer.

9
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,233
There was no hurry, for there was
nowhere to go and nothing to buy...

10
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:46,026
no money to buy it with...

11
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,153
although Maycomb County
had recently been told...

12
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,698
that it had nothing to fear
but fear itself.

13
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,327
That summer I was sixyears old.

14
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:59,039
- Good morning, Mr Cunningham.
- Mornin', miss.

15
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:03,043
My daddy's getting dressed.
Would you like me to call him for you?

16
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:06,964
- No, miss. I don't care to bother.
- Why, it's no bother, Mr Cunningham.

17
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,508
He'll be happy to see you!
Atticus!

18
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,265
Here's Mr Cunningham.

19
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:21,228
- Good morning, Walter.
- Mornin', Mr Finch.

20
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:23,772
I didn't want to bother you none.

21
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,900
I brung you these here hickory nuts
as part of my entailment.

22
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:30,904
Well, I thank you. The collards
we had last week were delicious.

23
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,324
- Well, mornin'.
- Morning.

24
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,914
Scout, I think maybe...

25
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:45,085
next time Mr Cunningham comes,
you better not call me.

26
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,589
- I thought you'd wanna thank him.
- I do.

27
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:51,091
I think it embarrasses him
to be thanked.

28
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:58,891
Why does he bring you
all this stuff?

29
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,477
He's payin' me
for some legal work I did for him.

30
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,647
- Why does he pay you like this?
- That's the only way he can.

31
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,148
He has no money.

32
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,233
- Is he poor?
- Yes.

33
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:15,324
- Are we poor?
- We are indeed.

34
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:18,160
Are we as poor
as the Cunninghams?

35
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:22,247
No, not exactly. Cunninghams
are country folks, farmers.

36
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:25,709
Crash hit them the hardest.

37
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:32,466
- Scout, call your brother.
- Atticus. Jem's up in the tree.

38
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,468
He says he won't come down
until you agree...

39
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,221
to play football
for the Methodists.

40
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,018
Jem.

41
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,816
Son, why don't you come on down out
ofthere now and have your breakfast?

42
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:51,527
Calpurnia has a good one.
Hot biscuits.

43
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:55,489
No, sir! Not until you agree
to play football for the Methodists.

44
00:05:55,572 --> 00:06:00,369
Oh, son, I can't do that. I explained
to you I'm too old to get out there.

45
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:03,038
After all,
I'm the only fatheryou have.

46
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:05,916
Wouldn't want me to go out there
and get my head knocked off, would you?

47
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,501
I ain't comin' down!

48
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,796
Suit yourself.

49
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,594
Mornin'.

50
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:21,307
- Morning, Miss Maudie.
- What's goin' on over there?

51
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:25,227
I'm havin' a terrible time.
Jem's stayin' up in the tree...

52
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,272
until Atticus agrees
to play football for the Methodists.

53
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,817
And Atticus says he's too old.

54
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,903
Every time I'm wantin'
to do somethin', he's too old!

55
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:39,867
- He's too old for anything!
- He can do plenty of things.

56
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,037
You be good, children.
Mind Cal.

57
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,832
- Mornin', Maudie.
- Mornin', Atticus.

58
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:49,251
He won't let me have a gun...

59
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:52,921
and he'll only play touch football
with me-- never tackle.

60
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:58,719
He can make somebody's will
so airtight, you can't break it.

61
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:02,181
You count your blessin's
and stop complainin'. Both ofyou.

62
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:05,351
Thankyour stars
he has the sense to act his age.

63
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:09,104
-Jem, he is pretty old.
- I can't help that.

64
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:15,694
Hey.

65
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:23,786
- Hey yourself.
- I'm Charles Baker Harris. I can read.

66
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,373
You got anything needs readin',
l can do it.

67
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:30,292
How old are you?
Four and a half?

68
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:33,712
- Goin' on seven.
- No wonder then.

69
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:35,923
Scout's been readin'
since she was born...

70
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:39,093
and she don't start school
till next month.

71
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:41,553
You look right puny
for goin' on seven.

72
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,514
I'm little, but I'm old.

73
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:48,978
Folks call me Dill.
I'm from Meridian, Mississippi...

74
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:53,065
and I'm spendin' two weeks next door
with my Aunt Stephanie.

75
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:55,609
My mama works
for a photographer in Meridian.

76
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:58,404
She entered my picture
in the "Beautiful Child" contest...

77
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,906
and won five dollars on me.

78
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:05,077
She give the money to me, and I went
to the picture show 20 times with it.

79
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:10,082
Our mama's dead, but we got a daddy.
Where's your daddy?

80
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:12,876
I haven't got one.

81
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,337
- Is he dead?
- No.

82
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:21,802
If he's not dead,
you've got one. Haven't you?

83
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,640
Hush, Scout.

84
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,643
What did I do?

85
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,318
- Dill, this is Calpurnia.
- Pleased to know you, Dill.

86
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,361
Pleased to know you.

87
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:41,572
My daddy owns the L&N railroad.

88
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:45,159
He's gonna let me run the engine
all the way to New Orleans.

89
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:47,202
Is that so?

90
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:51,707
He says I can invite anybody--

91
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:59,882
There goes the meanest man
that ever took a breath of life.

92
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,096
Why is he the meanest man?

93
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,682
Well, for one thing...

94
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:12,102
he has a boy named Boo...

95
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:15,272
that he keeps chained to a bed
in the house over yonder.

96
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:20,527
Come on.

97
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,951
See? He lives over there.

98
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:32,790
Boo only comes out at night
when you're asleep and it's pitch-dark.

99
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,167
When you wake up at night,
you can hear him.

100
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,045
Once I heard him scratchin'
on our screen door...

101
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:41,423
but he was gone
by the time Atticus got there.

102
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,760
Wonder what he does in there.

103
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:49,056
- Wonder what he looks like.
- Well...

104
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,311
judgin' from his tracks,
he's about six and a halffeet tall.

105
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:58,649
He eats raw squirrels
and all the cats he can catch.

106
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:03,278
There's a long, jagged scar
that runs all the way across his face.

107
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:06,615
His teeth are yellow and rotten,
his eyes are popped...

108
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,617
and he drools most ofthe time.

109
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,913
I don't believe you.

110
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:16,458
- Dill, what are you doin' here?
- My Lord, Aunt Stephanie!

111
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,629
- You almost gave me a heart attack!
- I don't want you playing there.

112
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,840
There's a maniac lives there,
and he's dangerous.

113
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,383
See?

114
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:27,428
I wasjust tryin' to warn him about Boo,
but he wouldn't believe me.

115
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,722
You just better believe him,
Mr Dill Harris.

116
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,890
Tell him how Boo
tried to kill his papa.

117
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:35,102
I was standin' in my yard one day
when his mama come out yellin'...

118
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:36,603
"He's killin' us all!"

119
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:40,190
Turned out that Boo was cuttin' up
the paper for his scrapbook...

120
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:43,027
and when his daddy come by,
he reached over with his scissors...

121
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,280
stabbed him in his leg, pulled them out
and went right on cuttin' the paper.

122
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:49,325
They wanted to send him to an asylum,
but his daddy said...

123
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:51,660
"No Radley's goin' to any asylum."

124
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:54,163
So they locked him up
in the basement ofthe courthouse...

125
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:57,875
till he nearly died ofthe damp,
and his daddy brought him back home.

126
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,879
There he is to this day,
sittin' over there with his scissors.

127
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,298
Lord knows what
he's doin' or thinkin'.

128
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:11,764
Six, seven, eight...

129
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,433
nine, ten!

130
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:20,522
Come on, Scout! lt's 5:00!

131
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,572
- Where you goin'?
- Time to meet Atticus.

132
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:31,784
- Why do you call your daddy Atticus?
- 'Cause Jem does.

133
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,911
- Why does he?
- I don't know.

134
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,955
Hejust started to
ever since he began talking.

135
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:45,339
Wait. Stop.
Miss Dubose is on her porch.

136
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:48,968
Listen, no matter what she says to you,
don't answer her back.

137
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:51,804
There's a Confederate pistol
in her lap under her shawl...

138
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:54,306
and she'll kill you
quick as look at you.

139
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:56,392
Come on.

140
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:07,695
- Hey, Miss Dubose.
- Don't say "Hey" to me, you ugly girl!

141
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:11,073
You say,
"Good afternoon, Miss Dubose."

142
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,701
You come over here
when I'm talkin' to you!

143
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:16,870
You come over here, I said!

144
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,831
- You listen to me when I'm talkin'!
- Atticus, this is Dill.

145
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:21,917
- How do you do, Dill?
- Don't your daddy teach you respect?

146
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:25,462
You come back here,
Jean Louise Finch!

147
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:29,425
Good afternoon, Miss Dubose.

148
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:33,178
My, you look like a picture
this afternoon.

149
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:35,681
He don't say a picture ofwhat.

150
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:38,600
My goodness gracious,
look at your flowers.

151
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:41,687
Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful?

152
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,816
Miss Dubose, the gardens at Bellingrath
have nothing to compare...

153
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,277
with your flowers.

154
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,946
Well, I don't think
they're as nice as last year.

155
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,616
He gets her interested in something nice
so she forgets bein' mean.

156
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,078
I think that youryard is gonna be
the showplace ofthis town.

157
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:01,832
Well, grand seein' you,
Miss Dubose.

158
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:20,225
"l had two cats
which I brought ashore...

159
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:23,687
on my first raft.

160
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:27,566
And I had a dog."

161
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:32,029
Do you think Boo Radley
ever really comes...

162
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,907
and looks in my window at night?

163
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,285
Jem says he does. This afternoon
when we were over by their house--

164
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:44,083
Scout, I told you and Jem
to leave those poor people alone.

165
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:48,921
I want you to stay away from their house
and stop tormentin' them.

166
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:52,174
- Yes, sir.
- That's all the readin' for tonight.

167
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:55,052
- It's gettin' late.
- What time is it?

168
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:59,098
- 8:30.
- May I see your watch?

169
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:21,120
"To Atticus,
my beloved husband."

170
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,458
Jem says this watch
is gonna belong to him someday.

171
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:29,378
- That's right.
- Why?

172
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:35,843
Well, it's customary for the boy
to have his father's watch.

173
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:39,388
What are you gonna give me?

174
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,267
Well...

175
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,645
I don't know that I have much else
ofvalue that belongs to me.

176
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,152
But there's a pearl necklace.

177
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:56,280
There's a ring
that belonged to your mother.

178
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,282
And I put them away...

179
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,035
and they're to be yours.

180
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,087
- Good night, Scout.
- Good night.

181
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,308
- Good night,Jem.
- Good night.

182
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:41,075
Yes?

183
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:48,082
- How old was I when Mama died?
- Two.

184
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:51,835
- How old were you?
- Six.

185
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,631
Old as I am now?

186
00:15:58,342 --> 00:16:01,136
Was Mama pretty?

187
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:05,015
Was Mama nice?

188
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:12,564
- Did you love her?
- Yes.

189
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:16,402
- Did I love her?
- Yes.

190
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:22,157
Do you miss her?

191
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,462
- Evenin', Atticus.
- Good evening,Judge.

192
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,218
Rather warm, isn't it?

193
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:43,679
Yes, indeed.

194
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:52,438
- How's Mrs Taylor?
- She's fine. Fine, thankyou.

195
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:59,987
Atticus, you heard
about Tom Robinson.

196
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:03,032
Yes, sir.

197
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:06,410
Grand jury will get around
to chargin' him tomorrow.

198
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:16,587
I was thinking about appointing you
to take his case.

199
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:23,927
Now, I realize you're very busy
these days with your practice.

200
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,474
And your children
need a great deal ofyour time.

201
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,312
Yes, sir.

202
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,027
I'll take the case.

203
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:45,282
I'll send a boy over foryou tomorrow
when his hearing comes up.

204
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:52,956
- Well, l'll see you tomorrow, Atticus.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:17:56,543 --> 00:18:00,297
- And thankyou.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,226
Hey,Jem...

207
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:16,063
I bet you a "Grey Ghost"
against two "Tom Swifts"...

208
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:19,233
you wouldn't go any farther
than Boo Radley's gate.

209
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,991
- Scared to, ain't you?
- I ain't scared.

210
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:30,619
I go past Boo Radley's house
nearly every day of my life.

211
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,664
- Always running.
- You hush up, Scout.

212
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,504
- Come on, Dill!
- Me first!

213
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:44,967
- You gotta let Dill be first.
- No, me!

214
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,011
Let her be first.

215
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:49,054
All right. Get in!

216
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:52,099
- Hurry up!
- All right.

217
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,519
- You ready?
- Uh-huh. Let her go.

218
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,669
Get away from there!
Scout, come on!

219
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,131
Don'tjust lie there! Get up!

220
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:30,137
Come on!

221
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:40,481
Run foryour life!
Come on, Dill!

222
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:51,909
Now who's the coward?
You tell them about this...

223
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:55,371
back in Meridian County,
Mr Dill Harris.

224
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,666
I'll tell you what let's do.

225
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:02,670
Let's go down to the courthouse, and
see the room that they locked Boo up in.

226
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:06,423
My aunt says it's bat-infested,
and he nearly died from the mildew.

227
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:10,052
Come on! I bet they got chains
and instruments oftorture down there.

228
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,389
Come on!

229
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:18,352
-Jem Finch?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:21,814
If you're lookin' foryour daddy,
he's inside the courthouse.

231
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:25,025
- Thank you, sir, but we're not look--
- Thank you, Mr Townsend, sir.

232
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,738
What's your daddy doin'
in the courthouse?

233
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:32,574
He's a lawyer,
and he has a case.

234
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,077
The grand jury's chargin'
his client today.

235
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,205
I heard somethin' about it last night
when Judge Taylor came over.

236
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:41,375
- Let's go watch!
- No, Dill!

237
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,419
He wouldn't like that.

238
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,591
Wait a minute!

239
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,307
- Is that the courtroom?
- Yeah.

240
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,897
I can't see anything.

241
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,444
You all lift me up
so I can see what's goin' on.

242
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,988
All right. Make a saddle.

243
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,078
Not much is happenin'.

244
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:22,249
Thejudge looks like he's asleep.

245
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:28,172
I see your daddy
and a coloured man.

246
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,591
The coloured man--

247
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:33,385
The coloured man looks to me
like he's cryin'.

248
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:37,097
- I seen him with my Mayella.
- I wonder what he's done to cry about?

249
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,932
What's goin' on?

250
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:44,063
There's a whole lot of men
sittin' together on one side...

251
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:47,900
and one man keeps pointin'
at the coloured man and yellin'.

252
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:52,488
- They're takin' the coloured man away.
- Where's Atticus?

253
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,242
I can't see your daddy now either.

254
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,956
- I wonder where in the world--
- Scout,Jem.

255
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,294
What in the world
are you doin' here?

256
00:22:07,378 --> 00:22:09,880
Hello, Atticus.

257
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:12,299
What are you doin' here?

258
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:16,011
We came down to find out
where Boo Radley was locked up.

259
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:18,389
We wanted to see the bats.

260
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:22,017
I want you all back home
right away.

261
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:24,269
- Yes, sir.
- Run along now.

262
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:27,773
I'll see you there for dinner.

263
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:41,161
Hey, howdy, Cap'n.

264
00:22:42,204 --> 00:22:44,957
- Mr Ewell.
- Cap'n, l--

265
00:22:45,082 --> 00:22:49,461
I'm real sorry they picked you to defend
that nigger that raped my Mayella.

266
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:53,090
I don't know why I didn't kill him
myself instead of goin' to the sheriff.

267
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:56,468
I'd have saved you and the sheriff
and the taxpayers lots oftrouble.

268
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:59,430
- Excuse me, Mr Ewell. I'm very busy.
- Hey, Captain...

269
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:02,891
somebody told mejust now...

270
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:07,313
they thought that you believed
Tom Robinson's story agin ours.

271
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:11,025
You know what I said?

272
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,945
I said, "You wrong, man.
You dead wrong!

273
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,948
Mr Finch ain't takin'
his story against ours."

274
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:23,454
- They was wrong, wasn't they?
- I'm appointed to defend Tom Robinson.

275
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:27,499
Now that he's been charged,
that's what I intend to do.

276
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,544
- You takin' his story--
- If you'll excuse me.

277
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,135
What kind of man are you?

278
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,220
You got children ofyour own.

279
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,993
I think we ought to stay right here
in Miss Stephanie's yard.

280
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:06,121
You don't have to come along,
Angel May.

281
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:23,097
What are you gonna do?

282
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:27,059
Gonna look in a window
at the Radley house...

283
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:29,603
and see ifwe can
get a look at Boo Radley!

284
00:24:30,646 --> 00:24:32,481
Come on.

285
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,488
- Please. I'm scared.
- Then go home ifyou're scared!

286
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,824
I swear, you act more
like a girl all the time.

287
00:24:41,907 --> 00:24:43,993
- Come on.
- Wait for me. I'm coming.

288
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,960
We'll go around back...

289
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:56,005
and crawl under the high wire fence
at the rear ofthe Radley lot.

290
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,717
I don't believe
we can be seen from there.

291
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:12,062
Come on.

292
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:27,911
Come on.

293
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,999
Come on.

294
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:38,422
Hold it up for me.

295
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:57,274
Don't make a sound.

296
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:06,867
Spit on it.

297
00:26:10,996 --> 00:26:12,915
All right.

298
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,006
Spit some more.

299
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,013
All right.

300
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:52,204
Come on.

301
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,235
Come on. Hurry!

302
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:50,114
Hurry!

303
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:35,367
Quick! Come on!

304
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,917
Quiet!

305
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:51,342
- What are you gonna do for pants?
- I don't know.

306
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:00,809
You come on in now.

307
00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:04,855
I better go.

308
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,651
Coming, Aunt Stephanie!

309
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:10,944
So long.
I'll see you next summer.

310
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:12,905
So long!

311
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:16,033
I'm comin'!

312
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:20,829
- I'm goin' back after my pants.
- Please,Jem. Come on in the house.

313
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:23,666
I can't go in without my pants.

314
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:26,669
- Then I'm goin' to call Atticus.
- No, you're not.

315
00:30:26,752 --> 00:30:29,838
Now listen. Atticus ain't never
whipped me since I can remember...

316
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:32,675
and I plan to keep it that way.

317
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:36,762
- Then I'm goin' with you.
- You ain't! Now you stay right here.

318
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:39,223
I'll be back
before you can count to ten.

319
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:52,611
One, two...

320
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:56,991
three, four--

321
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:02,997
Come on in.

322
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:05,457
Five...

323
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:10,587
six, seven, eight...

324
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:14,008
nine, ten...

325
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:20,889
1 1 , 1 2...

326
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:25,185
1 3, 1 4--

327
00:31:44,538 --> 00:31:47,666
What was that? What is it?

328
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,710
What happened?

329
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,465
What's goin' on? What is it?

330
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,134
What is it?

331
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:59,970
Will somebody please tell me
what's goin' on?

332
00:32:01,805 --> 00:32:06,143
Mr Radley shot at a prowler
out in his collard patch.

333
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:08,395
A prowler? Oh, Maudie!

334
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:11,190
Whoever it was
won't be back anytime soon.

335
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:13,275
Mr Radley must have scared them
out oftheir wits.

336
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,277
Well, good night.

337
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:18,322
Scared the livin' daylights
out of me.

338
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:26,705
Come on now. The excitement's over.
Time for bed.

339
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:52,022
Mornin'.

340
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:56,068
- Good morning, Miss Maudie.
- Good morning, Calpurnia.

341
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:58,570
Came to see if Jean Louise
is ready for her first day at school.

342
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:01,323
- Hey,Jem. Y'all ready?
- Yes, ma'am.

343
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:07,454
What are you gonna do with yourself
with both children at school?

344
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:10,374
I don't know,
and that's the truth.

345
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:12,918
I was thinkin' about thatjust now.

346
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:23,470
Did you hear me? Now hurry!

347
00:33:34,898 --> 00:33:37,568
Hey, everybody.
Look at Scout!

348
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:45,409
Come on in here.

349
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:50,706
Have your breakfast.

350
00:33:59,548 --> 00:34:01,800
I thinkyour dress
is mighty becomin', honey.

351
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:04,720
Now don't go tuggin' at that dress.

352
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:07,765
You wanna have it all wrinkled
before you even get to school?

353
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:13,354
I still don't see why
l have to wear a darn old dress.

354
00:34:13,437 --> 00:34:15,606
- You'll get used to it.
- I'm ready!

355
00:34:19,735 --> 00:34:22,946
It's half an hour
before school starts.

356
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:26,367
Sit back down
and wait for your sister.

357
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:35,000
- Hurry up!
- I'm tryin' to.

358
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:38,671
Come on! lt's your first day.
You wanna be late?

359
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:44,009
- I'm ready.
- Let's go!

360
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:50,015
Bye!

361
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:11,245
Darn you, Walter Cunningham!

362
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:23,507
Cut that out!

363
00:35:23,632 --> 00:35:26,051
What do you think you're doin'?

364
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:31,265
He made me start off
on the wrong foot!

365
00:35:31,348 --> 00:35:33,642
I was tryin' to explain
to that darn lady teacher...

366
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:37,646
why he didn't have no money
for his lunch, and she got sore at me!

367
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:41,025
Stop it!

368
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:53,412
Your daddy Mr Walter Cunningham
from Old Sarum?

369
00:35:56,332 --> 00:35:59,543
Come home and have dinner with us.
We'd be glad to have you.

370
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:04,631
Our daddy is a friend
ofyour daddy's.

371
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:10,095
Scout here is crazy.
She won't fight you no more.

372
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:16,977
I hope that's a dinner
that you enjoy.

373
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:20,481
Yes, sir. I don't know when
l've had a roast.

374
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:24,151
We've been having squirrels
and rabbits lately.

375
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:29,740
My pa and I go hunting
in our spare time.

376
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:32,409
You got a gun ofyour own?

377
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:37,122
- How long you had a gun?
- Ayear or so.

378
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,461
- Can I have the syrup, please?
- Certainly, son.

379
00:36:43,796 --> 00:36:45,798
Will you bring in
the syrup dish, please?

380
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:48,008
Yes, sir.

381
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,594
How old were you
when you got your first gun?

382
00:36:51,637 --> 00:36:53,597
Thirteen or fourteen.

383
00:36:56,016 --> 00:36:59,269
I remember when my daddy
gave me that gun.

384
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,023
He told me that I should never
point at anything in the house...

385
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:06,944
and that he'd rather
l shoot at tin cans in the backyard.

386
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:13,200
But he said that soon the temptation
to go after birds would be too much...

387
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:18,706
and that I could shoot
all the bluejays I wanted...

388
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:20,874
if I could hit 'em.

389
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:24,211
But to remember it was a sin
to kill a mockingbird.

390
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,922
Why?

391
00:37:27,006 --> 00:37:30,342
I reckon 'cause mockingbirds
don't do anything...

392
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:32,845
but make music for us to enjoy.

393
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:39,935
Don't eat people's gardens.
Don't nest in the corn cribs.

394
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,690
They don't do one thing
butjust sing their hearts out for us.

395
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:48,819
How'd you like school?

396
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:51,822
All right.

397
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:55,034
Thankyou, Cal.
That's for Walter.

398
00:38:16,055 --> 00:38:20,059
What in the sam hill
are you doin'--

399
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:23,395
But Atticus, he's gone
and drowned his dinner in syrup...

400
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:26,231
and now he's pourin' it
all over.

401
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:30,778
- What?
- Come out here. I wanna talk to you.

402
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,747
That boy is your company...

403
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,501
and if he wants to eat up
that tablecloth, you let him, you hear?

404
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:47,503
And ifyou can't act fit
to eat like folks...

405
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:50,047
you can just sit here
and eat in the kitchen.

406
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:10,401
What in the world
has got into you?

407
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,529
- Now, now.
- I'm not goin' back.

408
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:20,202
I'm not goin' back
to school anymore.

409
00:39:20,285 --> 00:39:22,871
Now, Scout.
It's just the first day.

410
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:26,125
I don't care.
Everything went wrong.

411
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,794
The teacher got mad
as the devil at me...

412
00:39:28,877 --> 00:39:31,714
and said you were teaching me
to read all wrong...

413
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,382
and to stop it.

414
00:39:33,465 --> 00:39:37,094
and then acted like a fool and tried
to give Walter Cunningham a quarter...

415
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:41,807
when everybody knows Cunninghams
won't take nothin' from nobody.

416
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,059
Any fool
could have told her that.

417
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:46,603
Maybe she'sjust nervous.

418
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:50,899
After all, it's her first day
teachin' school and bein' new here.

419
00:39:52,192 --> 00:39:55,154
Now wait a minute.

420
00:39:57,406 --> 00:39:59,783
Ifyou learn this single trick...

421
00:39:59,908 --> 00:40:02,911
you'll get along a lot better
with all kinds of folks.

422
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:04,997
You never really
understand a person...

423
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,292
until you consider things
from his point ofview.

424
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,002
Sir?

425
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:14,506
Till you climb inside of his skin
and walk around in it.

426
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:18,636
But if I keep goin' to school,
we can't ever read anymore.

427
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:28,854
Do you know
what a compromise is?

428
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,857
Bendin' the law?

429
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:40,199
No, it's an agreement
reached by mutual consent.

430
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:47,623
Now here's the way it works.

431
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:51,168
You concede the necessity
of goin' to school...

432
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:56,882
we'll keep right on readin'
the same every night...

433
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:58,884
just as we always have.

434
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:03,222
Is that a bargain?

435
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:09,311
Therejust didn 'tseem to be...

436
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:12,731
anyone oranything
Atticus couldn 't explain.

437
00:41:13,857 --> 00:41:17,653
Though it wasn 't a talent that would
arouse the admiration of ourfriends...

438
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:20,239
Jem and I had to admit
he was very good at that.

439
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:23,784
But that was all he was good at...

440
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:25,786
we thought.

441
00:41:26,203 --> 00:41:28,122
See? There he is.

442
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:42,386
Come on inside.

443
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:44,388
Come on. Get in.

444
00:41:52,938 --> 00:41:54,773
Mr Finch? This is Cal.

445
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:57,776
I swear to God, there's a mad dog
down the street a piece.

446
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,820
He's comin' this way!

447
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:10,205
There he is.

448
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,210
He's got it, all right, Mr Finch.

449
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:21,467
Stay inside, son.
Keep him in there, Cal.

450
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:25,054
He's within range, Heck.

451
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:29,642
- Take him, Mr Finch.
- No, Mr Tate.

452
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:31,935
- He can't shoot!
- Don't waste time.

453
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:35,439
For God's sake,
he's got to be killed right away.

454
00:42:35,522 --> 00:42:38,525
Look where he is. I can't shoot
that well, and you know it.

455
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:41,320
- I haven't shot a gun in years.
- I'd feel mighty comfortable...

456
00:42:41,403 --> 00:42:43,364
ifyou did now.

457
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:40,045
Don't go near that dog.
He'sjust as dangerous dead as alive.

458
00:43:40,129 --> 00:43:42,047
Yes, sir.

459
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,510
Yes, son.

460
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,141
- Nothin'.
- What's the matter, boy?

461
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:55,602
Can't you talk? Didn't you know your
daddy's the best shot in this county?

462
00:43:55,686 --> 00:43:58,939
Hush, Heck.
Let's get back to town.

463
00:43:59,023 --> 00:44:01,984
- Remember, now. Don't go near that dog.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,280
I'll send Zeebo out right away
to pick him up.

465
00:44:27,217 --> 00:44:30,054
Can we go with you?

466
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:32,222
- Can we? Please?
- Huh? Can we?

467
00:44:32,306 --> 00:44:35,601
No. I have to go to the country
on business, and you'll just get tired.

468
00:44:35,684 --> 00:44:38,395
No, not me!
l won't get tired.

469
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:42,775
Well, promise to stay in the car
while I talk to Helen Robinson.

470
00:44:43,692 --> 00:44:45,944
And not nag me about leavin'
ifyou do get tired.

471
00:44:46,236 --> 00:44:47,988
All right. Climb in.

472
00:44:56,747 --> 00:45:00,793
- Who's Helen Robinson?
- The wife ofthe man I'm defending.

473
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:23,273
- Good evening, David.
- Good evening.

474
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:25,943
- Good evening, Helen.
- Evening, Mr Finch.

475
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:28,112
I came over to tell you
about my visit with Tom.

476
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:29,780
- Yes, sir.
- And to let you know...

477
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:32,032
that I got a postponement
ofthe trial.

478
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:08,694
Would you tell my daddy
to come out here, please?

479
00:46:58,577 --> 00:47:01,455
You nigger lover.

480
00:47:18,973 --> 00:47:22,309
There's no need to be afraid of him,
son. He's all bluff.

481
00:47:37,074 --> 00:47:39,201
Nigger lover!

482
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:54,216
There's a lot of ugly things
in this world, son.

483
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:58,429
I wish I could keep 'em all
away from you.

484
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:03,392
That's never possible.

485
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,981
Ifyou wait till I get Scout in bed,
l'll drive you home.

486
00:48:09,064 --> 00:48:11,025
Yes, sir.

487
00:48:25,789 --> 00:48:28,917
Do you mind stayin' here with Scout
till I get Cal home?

488
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:31,670
- No, sir.
- Night,Jem.

489
00:48:31,754 --> 00:48:33,672
Night, Cal.

490
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:07,534
Atticus had promised me
he would wear me out...

491
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:10,496
ifhe ever heard
ofme fightin' anymore.

492
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:14,041
I was far too old and too big
for such childish things.

493
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:16,377
And the sooner
I learned to holdin...

494
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,254
the better off
everybody would be.

495
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,256
I soon forgot.

496
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:24,927
Cecil Jacobs made me forget.

497
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:30,849
What is it?

498
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:37,523
Atticus, do you defend niggers?

499
00:51:40,818 --> 00:51:43,737
- Don't say "nigger."
- I didn't say it.

500
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:47,157
Cecil Jacobs did.
That's why I had to fight him.

501
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:50,160
Scout, I don't want you fightin'.

502
00:51:51,161 --> 00:51:55,708
- I had to. He--
- I don't care what the reasons are.

503
00:51:55,833 --> 00:52:00,045
- I forbid you to fight.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:52:06,218 --> 00:52:10,889
Anyway, I'm simply defending
a Negro. Tom Robinson.

505
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:16,020
There are some things...

506
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:18,480
that you're not old enough
to understand just yet.

507
00:52:20,941 --> 00:52:25,863
There's been some high talk
around town...

508
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:29,033
to the effect that I shouldn't do much
about defending this man.

509
00:52:32,494 --> 00:52:36,623
Ifyou shouldn't be defending him,
then why are you doing it?

510
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:43,922
For a number of reasons.

511
00:52:46,175 --> 00:52:48,636
The main one is,
that if I didn't...

512
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:51,138
I couldn't hold my head up in town.

513
00:52:52,598 --> 00:52:55,559
I couldn't even
tell you orJem...

514
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:57,561
not to do somethin' again.

515
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,447
You're gonna hear some ugly talk
about this in school.

516
00:53:10,115 --> 00:53:14,578
But I want you
to promise me one thing:

517
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:17,790
that you won't get
into fights over it...

518
00:53:17,873 --> 00:53:20,334
no matter what they say to you.

519
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:28,968
Yes, sir.

520
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:44,525
What are you doing?

521
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:46,902
Walkin' like an Egyptian.

522
00:53:47,069 --> 00:53:49,279
We were studyin'
about 'em in school.

523
00:53:49,363 --> 00:53:51,657
Teacher says we wouldn't be
no place without 'em.

524
00:53:52,324 --> 00:53:53,993
Is that so?

525
00:53:54,118 --> 00:53:58,163
Cradle ofcivilization. They invented
embalming and toilet paper.

526
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:03,127
That's wrong.

527
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,340
You do your feet this way.

528
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:11,135
Look.

529
00:54:26,442 --> 00:54:30,571
Look. The boy wears hair in front
of his eyebrows like you do.

530
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:34,575
Yeah, and the girl
wears bangs like you.

531
00:54:34,658 --> 00:54:36,577
These are of us.

532
00:55:32,257 --> 00:55:34,009
You awake?

533
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:37,721
- Go back to bed.
- I can't go to sleep.

534
00:55:37,805 --> 00:55:42,226
- Go back to bed.
- What you got in the box?

535
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:44,436
Nothin'. Go back to bed.

536
00:55:52,569 --> 00:55:54,530
Come on.

537
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:05,040
If I show you, will you swear
never to tell anybody?

538
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:09,670
- I swear.
- Cross your heart.

539
00:56:31,442 --> 00:56:33,944
I found all ofthese...

540
00:56:34,028 --> 00:56:37,114
in the knothole ofthat old tree
at different times.

541
00:56:39,283 --> 00:56:42,202
This is a spelling medal.

542
00:56:44,413 --> 00:56:47,291
You know they used to award these
in school to spelling winners...

543
00:56:47,374 --> 00:56:49,793
before we were born.

544
00:56:50,878 --> 00:56:54,381
And another time I found this.

545
00:57:08,812 --> 00:57:10,731
This.

546
00:57:24,536 --> 00:57:27,831
And Scout...

547
00:57:27,915 --> 00:57:29,833
you know somethin' else
l never told you...

548
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:32,294
about that night I went back
to the Radley house?

549
00:57:32,378 --> 00:57:36,173
Somethin' else? You never told me
anything about that night.

550
00:57:37,132 --> 00:57:39,468
Well...

551
00:57:39,551 --> 00:57:42,137
you know the first time when I was
gettin' out of my britches?

552
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,849
They was all in a tangle...

553
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,893
and I couldn't get 'em loose.

554
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:53,524
Well, when I went back, though...

555
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:57,069
they were folded
across the fence...

556
00:57:57,152 --> 00:57:59,488
sort of like
they was expectin' me.

557
00:58:06,996 --> 00:58:09,665
It was to be a long time...

558
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:13,002
beforeJem andl
talkedabout Boo again.

559
00:58:15,587 --> 00:58:18,716
Schoolfinallyended
andsummercame...

560
00:58:19,717 --> 00:58:21,218
andso didDill.

561
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,512
- Good mornin'!
- Good mornin'.

562
00:58:23,595 --> 00:58:26,432
My, you're up
mighty bright and early.

563
00:58:26,515 --> 00:58:30,060
- I been up since 4:00.
- 4:00?

564
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:34,064
Yes. I always get up at 4:00.
It's in my blood.

565
00:58:34,148 --> 00:58:37,693
You see, my daddy was a railroad man
till he got rich.

566
00:58:37,776 --> 00:58:40,904
Now he flies aeroplanes.
One ofthese days...

567
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:43,073
he'sjust gonna swoop
down here at Maycomb...

568
00:58:43,157 --> 00:58:45,784
pick me up
and take me for a ride.

569
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,923
-Who's that in the car with the sheriff?
-Tom Robinson, son.

570
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:04,178
- Where's he been?
- In the Abbottsville Jail.

571
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:09,141
- Why?
- Sheriffthought he'd be safer there.

572
00:59:09,224 --> 00:59:11,852
They're bringin' him
back here tonight...

573
00:59:11,977 --> 00:59:13,854
because his trial is tomorrow.

574
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:34,792
- Good evenin', Heck.
- Good evenin', Mr Finch.

575
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:38,170
Come in.

576
00:59:42,758 --> 00:59:47,262
News has gotten around that I brought
Tom Robinson back to the jail.

577
00:59:47,346 --> 00:59:51,892
I heard there might be trouble
from that bunch out at Old Sarum.

578
01:00:02,611 --> 01:00:05,489
If I need you to stay here tonight,
can you do it?

579
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:07,700
- Yes, sir, I can.
- Thankyou.

580
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:19,294
- I thinkyou better count on stayin'.
- Yes, sir.

581
01:00:53,787 --> 01:00:56,457
- What's goin' on?
- Go back to sleep.

582
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,500
What's goin' on?

583
01:01:08,552 --> 01:01:10,512
There's his car.

584
01:01:23,942 --> 01:01:26,445
See? There he is over there!

585
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,077
No, Scout. Don't go to him.
He might not like it.

586
01:01:34,453 --> 01:01:37,706
I just wanted to see where he was
and what he was up to.

587
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,168
He's all right.
Let's go back home.

588
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:43,170
Come on.

589
01:02:40,978 --> 01:02:45,107
- He in there, Mr Finch?
- He is.

590
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:48,902
He's asleep. Don't wake him.

591
01:02:48,986 --> 01:02:51,447
You know what we want.

592
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:56,618
Get aside from that door, Mr Finch.

593
01:02:58,704 --> 01:03:00,622
Walter...

594
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:05,210
I thinkyou ought to turn
right around and go back home.

595
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:09,965
- Heck Tate's around here somewhere.
- No, he ain't.

596
01:03:10,049 --> 01:03:13,135
Heck and his bunch
is out in Old Sarum lookin' for us.

597
01:03:13,218 --> 01:03:15,804
We knowed he was,
so we come in this other way.

598
01:03:15,888 --> 01:03:18,432
You ain't thought about that,
had you, Mr Finch?

599
01:03:18,557 --> 01:03:21,352
- I thought about it.
- I can't see Atticus.

600
01:03:21,435 --> 01:03:24,730
That changes things some.

601
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:35,240
Jem, go home,
and take Scout and Dill with you.

602
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:40,829
- Son, I said go home.
- No, sir.

603
01:03:42,998 --> 01:03:47,127
- I'll send him home.
- Don't you touch him! Let him go!

604
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,588
That'll do!

605
01:03:52,007 --> 01:03:54,301
Ain't nobody
gonna do Jem that way!

606
01:03:56,887 --> 01:03:59,264
Now you get them out of here.

607
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:06,563
- I want you to please leave.
- No, sir.

608
01:04:08,857 --> 01:04:13,862
- I tell you I ain't goin'.
- Hey, Mr Cunningham.

609
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:20,953
I said, "Hey, Mr Cunningham."
How's your entailment getting along?

610
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:28,127
Don't you remember me,
Mr Cunningham?

611
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,504
I'mJean Louise Finch.

612
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:36,719
You brought us some hickory nuts
one early morning. Remember?

613
01:04:37,845 --> 01:04:40,055
We had a talk.

614
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:44,268
I went and got my daddy
to come out and thank you.

615
01:04:44,935 --> 01:04:48,564
I go to school with your boy.
I go to school with Walter.

616
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:53,485
He's a nice boy.
Tell him "hey" for me, won't you?

617
01:04:54,486 --> 01:04:56,613
You know somethin',
Mr Cunningham?

618
01:04:56,697 --> 01:05:00,075
Entailments are bad.
Entailments--

619
01:05:09,168 --> 01:05:13,297
I wasjust sayin' to Mr Cunningham
that entailments were bad...

620
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,549
but not to worry.

621
01:05:15,632 --> 01:05:18,260
Takes a long time sometimes.

622
01:05:20,596 --> 01:05:22,890
What's the matter?

623
01:05:30,105 --> 01:05:33,776
I sure meant no harm,
Mr Cunningham.

624
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:40,032
No harm taken, young lady.

625
01:05:43,452 --> 01:05:46,372
I'll tell Walteryou said "hey."

626
01:05:46,497 --> 01:05:48,624
Let's clear out of here.

627
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:51,960
Let's go, boys.

628
01:06:17,653 --> 01:06:20,447
Now you can go home.

629
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:23,200
All ofyou.

630
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:25,202
I'll be there later.

631
01:06:27,162 --> 01:06:29,039
Come on.

632
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:59,778
Mr Finch, they gone?

633
01:07:00,904 --> 01:07:04,950
They've gone.
They won't botheryou anymore.

634
01:07:25,763 --> 01:07:27,681
Morning, Mr Strikes.

635
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:30,517
- How do you do?
- Ever seen so many people?

636
01:07:30,601 --> 01:07:33,062
Just like on Saturday.

637
01:07:35,648 --> 01:07:38,442
- Where you goin'?
- I can't stand it any longer.

638
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:41,403
- I'm goin' to the courthouse and watch.
- Better not.

639
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:44,198
- You know what Atticus said.
- I don't care if he did.

640
01:07:44,323 --> 01:07:47,868
I'm not gonna miss the most exciting
thing that ever happened in this town.

641
01:08:07,596 --> 01:08:11,558
It's packed solid.
They're standin' all along the back.

642
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:15,604
- Reverend.
- Yes?

643
01:08:15,688 --> 01:08:19,817
-Reverend Sykes, are you going upstairs?
-Yes, I am.

644
01:08:29,576 --> 01:08:32,913
Thankyou, BrotherJoe,
for holding my seat.

645
01:08:32,997 --> 01:08:35,374
Come on, children.
Come on, come on.

646
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:12,953
This court's now in session.
Everybody rise.

647
01:09:24,965 --> 01:09:27,426
On the night ofAugust 2 1 ...

648
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:31,388
I wasjust leaving my office
to go home when Bob--

649
01:09:31,472 --> 01:09:33,849
Mr Ewell-- came in.

650
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,810
Very excited he was,
and he said...

651
01:09:36,894 --> 01:09:39,772
to get to his house
as quick as I could...

652
01:09:39,855 --> 01:09:42,232
that his girl had been raped.

653
01:09:42,316 --> 01:09:46,904
I got in my car and went out there
as fast as I could.

654
01:09:46,987 --> 01:09:48,864
She was pretty well beat up.

655
01:09:50,032 --> 01:09:53,827
I asked her ifTom Robinson
beat her like that.

656
01:09:53,911 --> 01:09:56,038
She said yes, he had.

657
01:09:57,414 --> 01:10:00,793
I asked if he'd
taken advantage of her.

658
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:03,879
She said yes, he did.

659
01:10:03,962 --> 01:10:06,382
That's all there was to it.

660
01:10:08,092 --> 01:10:09,718
Thankyou.

661
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:16,141
Did anybody call
a doctor, Sheriff?

662
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:18,978
- No, sir.
- Why not?

663
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:21,313
Well, I didn't think
it was necessary.

664
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:23,649
She was pretty well beat up.

665
01:10:23,774 --> 01:10:25,943
Somethin' sure happened.
It was obvious.

666
01:10:28,278 --> 01:10:33,367
Now, Sheriff, you say that she
was mighty beat up. In what way?

667
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:36,328
Well, she was beaten
around the head.

668
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:39,498
There were bruises
already comin' on her arms.

669
01:10:39,581 --> 01:10:42,710
She had a black eye startin'.

670
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:46,213
- Which eye?
- Let's see.

671
01:10:46,296 --> 01:10:48,215
It was her left.

672
01:10:49,383 --> 01:10:52,386
Well, now, was that--

673
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:55,180
That was her left,
facing you...

674
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:57,224
or looking the way
that you were?

675
01:10:57,308 --> 01:11:01,437
Yes, that would make it
her right eye.

676
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:05,941
It was her right eye, Mr Finch.
Now I remember.

677
01:11:06,025 --> 01:11:09,486
She was beaten up
on that side of her face.

678
01:11:15,326 --> 01:11:17,745
Which side again, Heck?

679
01:11:17,828 --> 01:11:19,580
The right side.

680
01:11:20,748 --> 01:11:23,208
She had bruises on her arms.

681
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:29,173
She showed me her neck. There were
definite finger marks on her gullet.

682
01:11:33,052 --> 01:11:38,140
All around her neck,
at the back of her throat?

683
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,102
I'd say they were all around.

684
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,446
The witness may be seated.

685
01:11:54,573 --> 01:11:56,033
Robert E. Lee Ewell.

686
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:03,415
Place your hand
on the Bible, please.

687
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,585
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

688
01:12:06,669 --> 01:12:08,754
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

689
01:12:12,257 --> 01:12:14,176
Now, Mr Ewell...

690
01:12:14,259 --> 01:12:17,262
you tell us,
just in your own words...

691
01:12:17,346 --> 01:12:20,391
what happened on August 2 1 .

692
01:12:20,474 --> 01:12:22,101
That night...

693
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:25,020
I was comin' from the woods
with a load of kindlin'...

694
01:12:25,145 --> 01:12:28,399
and I heard Mayella screaming
as I got to the fence.

695
01:12:28,482 --> 01:12:33,028
I dropped my kindlin', and I run as fast
as I could, but I run into the fence.

696
01:12:33,153 --> 01:12:37,616
But when I got loose,
l run up to the window...

697
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,327
and I seen him with my Mayella!

698
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:47,084
What did you do...

699
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:49,753
afteryou saw the defendant?

700
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:51,755
I run around the house
tryin' to get in...

701
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:55,050
but he done run through
the front doorjust ahead of me!

702
01:12:55,175 --> 01:12:57,177
But I seen who it was,
all right!

703
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,389
I seen him.

704
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:06,395
And I run in the house and...

705
01:13:06,478 --> 01:13:09,023
poor Mayella was layin'
on the floor squallin'.

706
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:13,652
Then I run for Mr Tate
just as quick as I could.

707
01:13:16,613 --> 01:13:17,865
Thankyou.

708
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:32,004
Would you mind if I just
askyou a few questions, Mr Ewell?

709
01:13:32,087 --> 01:13:34,548
No, sir, Mr Finch,
l sure wouldn't.

710
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,556
Folks were doin'
a lot of running that night.

711
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,394
You say that you ran to the house,
you ran to the window...

712
01:13:47,478 --> 01:13:51,857
you ran inside, you ran to Mayella
and you ran to SheriffTate.

713
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:56,445
Did you, during all this running,
run for a doctor?

714
01:13:56,528 --> 01:13:59,406
There wasn't no need to.
I seen who done it.

715
01:14:01,825 --> 01:14:05,079
Now, Mr Ewell, you've heard
the sheriff's testimony.

716
01:14:05,162 --> 01:14:07,665
Do you agree with his description
of Mayella's injuries?

717
01:14:08,457 --> 01:14:12,044
I agree with everything
Mr Tate said.

718
01:14:12,127 --> 01:14:14,046
Her eye was blacked.

719
01:14:14,129 --> 01:14:17,758
She was mighty beat up,
mighty beat up.

720
01:14:20,052 --> 01:14:25,307
Now, Mr Ewell, can you--
Can you read and write?

721
01:14:27,685 --> 01:14:31,522
Yes, sir, Mr Finch,
l can read and I can write.

722
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,692
Good.

723
01:14:35,818 --> 01:14:38,988
Then will you write
your name, please?

724
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:41,907
Right there.
Show us.

725
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:15,607
What's so interesting?

726
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:17,609
You're left-handed, Mr Ewell.

727
01:15:17,693 --> 01:15:21,864
What's that got to do with it,Judge?
I'm a God-fearin' man.

728
01:15:21,947 --> 01:15:24,491
That Atticus Finch,
he's tryin' to take advantage of me!

729
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:27,161
You got to watch tricky lawyers
like Atticus Finch!

730
01:15:27,286 --> 01:15:29,705
Quiet! Quiet, sir.

731
01:15:29,788 --> 01:15:32,708
Now the witness
may take his seat.

732
01:15:43,177 --> 01:15:44,928
Mayella Violet Ewell.

733
01:15:57,483 --> 01:15:59,693
Put your hand
on the Bible, please.

734
01:16:01,862 --> 01:16:05,783
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

735
01:16:05,908 --> 01:16:07,868
Sit down, please.

736
01:16:12,247 --> 01:16:14,249
Now, Mayella...

737
01:16:15,626 --> 01:16:20,339
suppose you tell us
just what happened, huh?

738
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:31,684
I was sittin' on the porch
and he come along.

739
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:38,565
There's this old chifforobe
in the yard...

740
01:16:39,525 --> 01:16:42,111
and I said...

741
01:16:42,194 --> 01:16:44,863
"You come in here, boy,
and bust up this chifforobe...

742
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:47,199
and l'll give you a nickel."

743
01:16:48,575 --> 01:16:51,203
So he come on in the yard...

744
01:16:51,286 --> 01:16:54,123
and I go in the house
to get him the nickel...

745
01:16:55,457 --> 01:16:58,419
and I turn around
and before I know it, he's on me.

746
01:17:00,629 --> 01:17:02,089
I fought and hollered...

747
01:17:02,172 --> 01:17:04,758
but he had me around the neck...

748
01:17:04,883 --> 01:17:08,512
and he hit me,
again and again.

749
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:15,602
And the next thing I knew,
Papa was in the room...

750
01:17:15,686 --> 01:17:17,938
standin' over me, hollerin'...

751
01:17:18,022 --> 01:17:21,400
"Who done it? Who done it?"

752
01:17:22,526 --> 01:17:24,403
Thankyou, Mayella.

753
01:17:26,113 --> 01:17:28,157
Your witness, Atticus.

754
01:17:31,368 --> 01:17:33,162
Miss Mayella...

755
01:17:34,204 --> 01:17:38,125
is your father good to you?

756
01:17:38,208 --> 01:17:41,378
I mean, is he easy
to get along with?

757
01:17:43,255 --> 01:17:44,673
Does tolerable.

758
01:17:44,757 --> 01:17:47,092
Except when he's drinking.

759
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:53,223
When he's riled,
has he ever beaten you?

760
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,567
My pa's never touched
a hair on my head in my life.

761
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:13,577
You say that you asked Tom to come in
and chop up a-- What was it?

762
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,622
A chifforobe.

763
01:18:16,705 --> 01:18:19,500
Was that the first time...

764
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:21,960
that you ever asked him
to come inside the fence?

765
01:18:23,045 --> 01:18:24,421
Yes.

766
01:18:26,131 --> 01:18:28,175
Didn't you ever ask him...

767
01:18:28,258 --> 01:18:30,636
to come inside the fence before?

768
01:18:34,932 --> 01:18:36,892
I might have.

769
01:18:38,102 --> 01:18:40,437
Can you remember
any other occasion?

770
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,359
You say...

771
01:18:45,442 --> 01:18:49,196
"He caught me, he choked me,
and he took advantage of me."

772
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:50,698
Is that right?

773
01:18:54,576 --> 01:18:56,954
Do you remember him
beating you about the face?

774
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:01,166
No.

775
01:19:01,291 --> 01:19:02,835
I don't...

776
01:19:04,837 --> 01:19:07,172
recollect if he hit me.

777
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:14,763
I mean, yes!
He hit me!

778
01:19:14,847 --> 01:19:16,515
He hit me!

779
01:19:22,646 --> 01:19:24,023
Thankyou.

780
01:19:24,106 --> 01:19:26,859
Now, will you identify
the man who beat you?

781
01:19:26,942 --> 01:19:30,029
I most certainly will.
Sittin' right yonder.

782
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:35,492
Tom, will you stand up, please?

783
01:19:35,576 --> 01:19:38,996
Let Miss Mayella have
a good long look at you.

784
01:19:48,714 --> 01:19:50,966
Will you catch this, please?

785
01:19:55,429 --> 01:19:56,472
Thankyou.

786
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,646
Now, then, this time will you
please catch it with your left hand.

787
01:20:04,855 --> 01:20:06,357
I can't, sir.

788
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:08,192
Why can't you?

789
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:10,694
I can't use my left hand at all.

790
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:15,658
I got it caught in a cotton gin
when I was 12 years old.

791
01:20:15,741 --> 01:20:18,285
All my muscles were tore loose.

792
01:20:35,511 --> 01:20:37,888
Is this the man who raped you?

793
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:42,142
It most certainly is.

794
01:20:43,227 --> 01:20:44,812
How?

795
01:20:47,815 --> 01:20:51,318
I don't know how he done it.

796
01:20:51,443 --> 01:20:53,696
Hejust done it.

797
01:20:53,779 --> 01:20:56,699
You have testified...

798
01:20:56,782 --> 01:21:00,869
that he choked you
and he beat you.

799
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:06,208
You didn't say that he sneaked up
behind you and knocked you out cold...

800
01:21:07,251 --> 01:21:10,629
but that you turned around...

801
01:21:10,713 --> 01:21:13,424
and there he was.

802
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:17,636
Do you want to tell us
what really happened?

803
01:21:19,888 --> 01:21:22,182
I got somethin' to say...

804
01:21:24,351 --> 01:21:26,937
and then I ain't
gonna say no more!

805
01:21:30,983 --> 01:21:33,986
He took advantage of me!

806
01:21:36,989 --> 01:21:39,366
And ifyou fine...

807
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:41,452
fancy gentlemen...

808
01:21:41,577 --> 01:21:43,787
ain't gonna do
nothin' about it...

809
01:21:43,871 --> 01:21:46,332
then you'rejust
a bunch of lousy...

810
01:21:46,415 --> 01:21:49,001
yellow, stinkin' cowards...

811
01:21:49,084 --> 01:21:51,378
the whole bunch ofya!

812
01:21:51,462 --> 01:21:54,757
And your fancy airs
don't come to nothin'!

813
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,010
Your "ma'am"-ing
and your "Miss Mayella"-ing...

814
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:01,138
it don't come to nothin',
Mr Finch!

815
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,979
You sit down now.

816
01:22:25,996 --> 01:22:27,623
Atticus.

817
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:32,127
Mr Gilmer.

818
01:22:36,548 --> 01:22:38,926
The State rests,Judge.

819
01:22:47,184 --> 01:22:49,520
Tom Robinson, take the stand.

820
01:23:04,827 --> 01:23:06,704
Put your hand on the Bible.

821
01:23:07,871 --> 01:23:11,166
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

822
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,168
- I do.
- Sit down.

823
01:23:27,891 --> 01:23:31,353
Were you acquainted
with Mayella Violet Ewell?

824
01:23:31,437 --> 01:23:32,646
Yes, sir.

825
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:36,275
I had to pass her place
going to and from the field every day.

826
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:39,903
Is there any other way to go?

827
01:23:39,987 --> 01:23:43,407
No, sir.
None's I know of.

828
01:23:43,532 --> 01:23:45,743
And did she ever speak to you?

829
01:23:45,826 --> 01:23:48,078
Why, yes, sir.

830
01:23:48,162 --> 01:23:50,539
I'd tip my hat when l'd go by.

831
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:55,169
And one day she asked me
to come inside the fence...

832
01:23:55,252 --> 01:23:58,339
and bust up a chifforobe for her.

833
01:23:58,422 --> 01:24:01,050
She give me the hatchet,
and I broke it up.

834
01:24:01,133 --> 01:24:03,594
And then she said...

835
01:24:03,677 --> 01:24:05,971
"I reckon I'll have
to give you a nickel, won't I?"

836
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:09,892
And I said, "No, ma'am.
There ain't no charge."

837
01:24:10,059 --> 01:24:11,894
And I went home.

838
01:24:13,062 --> 01:24:17,483
Mr Finch, that was way last spring,
way over a year ago.

839
01:24:18,859 --> 01:24:21,028
Did you ever go
on the place again?

840
01:24:24,573 --> 01:24:26,075
Yes, sir.

841
01:24:27,034 --> 01:24:28,577
When?

842
01:24:30,954 --> 01:24:34,625
I went lots oftimes.

843
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:37,419
Seemed like every time
l passed by yonder...

844
01:24:37,503 --> 01:24:39,963
she'd have some little
somethin' for me to do:

845
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:42,841
chopping kindlin'
and totin' water for her.

846
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:56,689
What happened to you...

847
01:24:56,772 --> 01:25:00,275
on the evening
ofAugust 2 1 of last year?

848
01:25:10,577 --> 01:25:13,664
I was goin' home
as usual that evenin'.

849
01:25:15,624 --> 01:25:18,544
When I passed the Ewell place...

850
01:25:18,627 --> 01:25:22,506
Miss Mayella were on the porch,
like she said she were.

851
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:26,427
She said for me to come there
and help her a minute.

852
01:25:27,386 --> 01:25:30,014
I went inside the fence...

853
01:25:30,097 --> 01:25:35,227
and I looked around for some kindlin'
to work on, but I didn't see none.

854
01:25:37,146 --> 01:25:40,107
Then she said
to come in the house...

855
01:25:40,232 --> 01:25:42,526
she has a door needs fixin'.

856
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,571
So I follows her inside...

857
01:25:45,696 --> 01:25:49,533
and I looked at the door,
and it looked all right.

858
01:25:50,951 --> 01:25:52,411
Then she shut the door.

859
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:59,084
All the time I was wonderin'
why it was so quiet like.

860
01:26:01,086 --> 01:26:03,756
And then it come to me.

861
01:26:03,839 --> 01:26:06,759
There was not a child
on the place.

862
01:26:06,842 --> 01:26:11,639
And I said, "Miss Mayella,
where are the children?"

863
01:26:13,349 --> 01:26:16,435
She said, "They all gone
to get ice cream."

864
01:26:16,518 --> 01:26:21,565
She said it took her a year to save
seven nickels, but she'd done it.

865
01:26:21,649 --> 01:26:23,901
And they'd all gone to town.

866
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:27,071
What did you say then?

867
01:26:30,407 --> 01:26:32,951
I said somethin' like...

868
01:26:33,035 --> 01:26:37,122
"Why, Miss Mayella,
that's right nice ofyou to treat 'em."

869
01:26:38,207 --> 01:26:40,584
She said, "You think so?"

870
01:26:40,668 --> 01:26:44,004
"Well," I said, "l best be goin'."

871
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:48,592
I couldn't do nothin' for her.
And she said yes, I could.

872
01:26:48,676 --> 01:26:50,636
And I asked her what.

873
01:26:52,096 --> 01:26:55,891
And she said tojust step
on the chairyonder...

874
01:26:56,016 --> 01:26:59,937
and get that box down
from on top ofthe chifforobe.

875
01:27:01,897 --> 01:27:05,192
So I done like she told me...

876
01:27:05,275 --> 01:27:08,362
and I was reachin'...

877
01:27:08,487 --> 01:27:13,283
when the next thing I know,
she grabbed me around the legs.

878
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:24,586
She scared me so bad, I hopped down
and turned the chair over.

879
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:27,256
That was the only thing--

880
01:27:27,339 --> 01:27:30,217
only furniture--
disturbed in the room, Mr Finch...

881
01:27:30,301 --> 01:27:32,636
I swear, when I left it.

882
01:27:35,431 --> 01:27:38,392
And what happened
afteryou turned the chair over?

883
01:27:52,698 --> 01:27:57,536
You've sworn to tell the whole truth.
Will you do it?

884
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:03,375
What happened after that?

885
01:28:11,216 --> 01:28:13,927
I got down offthe chair...

886
01:28:14,011 --> 01:28:17,264
and I turned around...

887
01:28:17,348 --> 01:28:20,142
and she sort ofjumped on me.

888
01:28:21,268 --> 01:28:24,313
She hugged me around the waist.

889
01:28:24,396 --> 01:28:27,316
She reached up
and kissed me on the face.

890
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:33,572
She said she'd never kissed
a grown man before...

891
01:28:33,697 --> 01:28:36,116
and she might as well kiss me.

892
01:28:37,326 --> 01:28:39,953
She says for me
to kiss her back...

893
01:28:41,538 --> 01:28:45,542
and I said, "Miss Mayella,
let me out of here"...

894
01:28:45,626 --> 01:28:47,544
and I tried to run.

895
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,300
Mr Ewell cussed at her
from the window.

896
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,887
He said he's gonna kill her.

897
01:29:05,604 --> 01:29:07,356
What happened after that?

898
01:29:11,026 --> 01:29:15,614
I was runnin' so fast,
l don't know what happened.

899
01:29:23,747 --> 01:29:27,418
Tom, did you rape Mayella Ewell?

900
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:33,716
I did not, sir.

901
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:37,511
Did you harm her in any way?

902
01:29:44,601 --> 01:29:47,187
I did not, sir.

903
01:30:06,623 --> 01:30:08,208
Robinson...

904
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:14,465
you're good at bustin' up chifforobes
and kindlin' with one hand, aren't ya?

905
01:30:14,548 --> 01:30:16,842
Strong enough to choke the breath
out ofa woman...

906
01:30:16,967 --> 01:30:18,969
and sling her to the floor?

907
01:30:20,054 --> 01:30:23,349
- I never done that, sir.
- But you're strong enough to.

908
01:30:25,142 --> 01:30:27,061
I reckon so, sir.

909
01:30:33,859 --> 01:30:37,613
How come you so all-fired anxious
to do that woman's chores?

910
01:30:41,325 --> 01:30:44,787
Looks like she--
she didn't have nobody to help her.

911
01:30:45,829 --> 01:30:47,122
Like I said--

912
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:50,417
With Mr Ewell and seven children
on the place?

913
01:30:50,501 --> 01:30:54,463
You did all this choppin' and work
out ofsheer goodness, boy?

914
01:30:56,173 --> 01:30:58,550
You're a mighty good fella,
it seems.

915
01:30:58,634 --> 01:31:01,011
Did all that for not one penny?

916
01:31:02,429 --> 01:31:06,725
Yes, sir.
I felt right sorry for her.

917
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:08,268
She seemed--

918
01:31:24,743 --> 01:31:26,912
You felt sorry for her?

919
01:31:27,997 --> 01:31:29,915
A white woman?

920
01:31:31,959 --> 01:31:35,087
You felt sorry for her.

921
01:32:07,953 --> 01:32:10,622
To begin with...

922
01:32:10,706 --> 01:32:13,334
this case should never
have come to trial.

923
01:32:13,417 --> 01:32:16,503
The State has not produced
one iota...

924
01:32:16,587 --> 01:32:18,589
of medical evidence...

925
01:32:18,672 --> 01:32:22,384
that the crime Tom Robinson
is charged with...

926
01:32:22,468 --> 01:32:24,845
ever took place.

927
01:32:25,888 --> 01:32:28,223
It has relied, instead...

928
01:32:28,349 --> 01:32:31,602
upon the testimony
oftwo witnesses...

929
01:32:31,685 --> 01:32:35,064
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question...

930
01:32:35,147 --> 01:32:37,691
on cross-examination...

931
01:32:37,775 --> 01:32:41,695
but has been flatly contradicted
by the defendant.

932
01:32:43,947 --> 01:32:47,409
There is circumstantial evidence
to indicate that...

933
01:32:47,493 --> 01:32:50,120
Mayella Ewell was beaten...

934
01:32:50,204 --> 01:32:52,289
savagely...

935
01:32:52,414 --> 01:32:57,044
by someone who led,
almost exclusively, with his left.

936
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:03,926
Tom Robinson now sits before you,
having taken the oath...

937
01:33:03,968 --> 01:33:07,680
with the only good hand
he possesses...

938
01:33:07,763 --> 01:33:09,723
his right.

939
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:24,363
I have nothing but pity
in my heart...

940
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:29,243
for the chiefwitness
for the State.

941
01:33:32,037 --> 01:33:34,039
She is the victim...

942
01:33:34,123 --> 01:33:37,501
ofcruel poverty and ignorance.

943
01:33:41,130 --> 01:33:44,591
But my pity...

944
01:33:44,675 --> 01:33:47,803
does not extend so far...

945
01:33:47,886 --> 01:33:51,015
as to her putting
a man's life at stake...

946
01:33:52,474 --> 01:33:56,645
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt.

947
01:33:57,855 --> 01:34:01,025
I say "guilt," gentlemen...

948
01:34:01,108 --> 01:34:04,903
because it was guilt...

949
01:34:05,029 --> 01:34:07,156
that motivated her.

950
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,492
She's committed no crime.

951
01:34:12,036 --> 01:34:14,913
She has merely broken
a rigid and time-honoured...

952
01:34:14,997 --> 01:34:17,207
code of our society.

953
01:34:18,751 --> 01:34:23,088
A code so severe that whoever breaks it
is hounded from our midst...

954
01:34:23,172 --> 01:34:25,299
as unfit to live with.

955
01:34:25,424 --> 01:34:28,594
She must destroy the evidence...

956
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:30,596
of her offence.

957
01:34:31,722 --> 01:34:36,101
But what was the evidence
of her offence?

958
01:34:36,185 --> 01:34:40,064
Tom Robinson, a human being.

959
01:34:42,733 --> 01:34:46,236
She must put Tom Robinson
away from her.

960
01:34:49,073 --> 01:34:52,868
Tom Robinson was to her
a daily reminder...

961
01:34:52,993 --> 01:34:55,829
ofwhat she did.

962
01:34:55,913 --> 01:34:58,082
Now, what did she do?

963
01:34:59,249 --> 01:35:01,335
She tempted a Negro.

964
01:35:01,418 --> 01:35:04,296
She was white,
and she tempted a Negro.

965
01:35:05,923 --> 01:35:09,635
She did something that,
in our society, is unspeakable.

966
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:13,180
She kissed a black man.

967
01:35:13,305 --> 01:35:15,766
Not an old uncle...

968
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:20,813
but a strong, young Negro man.

969
01:35:23,816 --> 01:35:27,569
No code mattered to her
before she broke it...

970
01:35:27,653 --> 01:35:30,990
but it came crashing down
on her afterwards.

971
01:35:38,747 --> 01:35:40,624
The witnesses for the State...

972
01:35:40,749 --> 01:35:43,043
with the exception
ofthe sheriff of Maycomb County...

973
01:35:43,127 --> 01:35:46,505
have presented themselves
to you gentlemen, to this court...

974
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:52,428
in the cynical confidence...

975
01:35:52,511 --> 01:35:55,514
that their testimony
would not be doubted.

976
01:35:56,557 --> 01:35:59,768
Confident that you gentlemen...

977
01:35:59,893 --> 01:36:03,022
would go along with them
on the assumption--

978
01:36:05,941 --> 01:36:07,776
the evil assumption--

979
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:10,279
that all Negroes lie...

980
01:36:10,404 --> 01:36:13,615
all Negroes are basically
immoral beings...

981
01:36:13,699 --> 01:36:18,078
all Negro men are not
to be trusted around our women.

982
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:26,628
An assumption that one associates
with minds oftheir calibre...

983
01:36:26,712 --> 01:36:31,091
and which is, in itself,
gentlemen, a lie.

984
01:36:33,886 --> 01:36:37,473
Which I do not need
to point out to you.

985
01:36:43,437 --> 01:36:45,147
And so...

986
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:49,943
a quiet, humble,
respectable Negro...

987
01:36:50,069 --> 01:36:53,864
who has had
the unmitigated temerity...

988
01:36:53,947 --> 01:36:56,909
to feel sorry
for a white woman...

989
01:36:58,452 --> 01:37:02,956
has had to put his word
against two white people's.

990
01:37:08,796 --> 01:37:11,507
The defendant is not guilty...

991
01:37:12,591 --> 01:37:15,761
but somebody
in this courtroom is.

992
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,473
Now, gentlemen...

993
01:37:20,849 --> 01:37:22,935
in this country...

994
01:37:23,018 --> 01:37:27,022
our courts are
the great levellers.

995
01:37:27,147 --> 01:37:29,441
In our courts...

996
01:37:29,525 --> 01:37:33,779
all men are created...

997
01:37:33,862 --> 01:37:35,489
equal.

998
01:37:36,532 --> 01:37:40,577
I'm no idealist
to believe firmly...

999
01:37:40,661 --> 01:37:43,789
in the integrity of our courts
and of our jury system.

1000
01:37:43,872 --> 01:37:48,544
That's no ideal to me.
That is a living, working reality!

1001
01:37:52,798 --> 01:37:57,344
I am confident that
you gentlemen will review...

1002
01:37:58,429 --> 01:38:01,598
without passion...

1003
01:38:01,682 --> 01:38:04,601
the evidence
that you have heard...

1004
01:38:05,978 --> 01:38:08,314
come to a decision...

1005
01:38:09,648 --> 01:38:12,443
and restore this man
to his family.

1006
01:38:22,286 --> 01:38:24,163
In the name of God...

1007
01:38:27,207 --> 01:38:29,126
do your duty.

1008
01:38:35,674 --> 01:38:38,135
In the name of God...

1009
01:38:38,218 --> 01:38:40,137
believe...

1010
01:38:41,388 --> 01:38:43,265
Tom Robinson.

1011
01:39:18,217 --> 01:39:21,178
How long has the jury
been out now, Reverend?

1012
01:39:22,179 --> 01:39:24,348
Let's see.

1013
01:39:24,473 --> 01:39:27,726
Almost two hours now.

1014
01:39:29,186 --> 01:39:32,982
I think that's an awful
good sign, don't you?

1015
01:40:19,278 --> 01:40:21,947
Court's now in session.
Everybody rise.

1016
01:40:42,343 --> 01:40:45,888
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1017
01:40:45,971 --> 01:40:47,681
We have, Your Honour.

1018
01:40:52,436 --> 01:40:55,189
Will the defendant please rise
and face the jury.

1019
01:41:04,114 --> 01:41:06,617
What is your verdict?

1020
01:41:06,742 --> 01:41:09,620
We find the defendant
guilty as charged.

1021
01:41:29,181 --> 01:41:32,226
Gentlemen,
this jury is dismissed.

1022
01:41:37,523 --> 01:41:39,441
Court is adjourned.

1023
01:41:50,744 --> 01:41:53,247
I'll go to see Helen
first thing tomorrow morning.

1024
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:56,625
I told her not to be disappointed,
we'd probably lose this one.

1025
01:43:01,857 --> 01:43:03,275
Miss Jean Louise.

1026
01:43:04,818 --> 01:43:07,655
Miss Jean Louise, stand up.

1027
01:43:11,575 --> 01:43:13,661
Your father's passin'.

1028
01:43:49,238 --> 01:43:52,282
I'm sorry, Atticus.

1029
01:43:52,366 --> 01:43:54,493
Thank you, Maudie.

1030
01:44:03,335 --> 01:44:05,754
Atticus, can I see you
for a minute?

1031
01:44:08,507 --> 01:44:10,426
Will you excuse me?

1032
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:39,872
Yes, ma'am?

1033
01:44:43,584 --> 01:44:46,628
I don't know if it'll help...

1034
01:44:46,712 --> 01:44:49,131
but I want to say this to you.

1035
01:44:53,344 --> 01:44:57,181
There's some men
in this world...

1036
01:44:57,264 --> 01:45:01,226
who are born to do
our unpleasant jobs for us.

1037
01:45:05,230 --> 01:45:07,441
Your father's one ofthem.

1038
01:45:11,904 --> 01:45:13,489
Oh, well.

1039
01:45:39,306 --> 01:45:41,934
What's the matter, Atticus?

1040
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:46,689
Tom Robinson's dead.

1041
01:45:57,116 --> 01:46:00,953
They were taking him
to Abbottsville...

1042
01:46:01,036 --> 01:46:03,455
for safekeeping.

1043
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:06,041
Tom broke loose and ran.

1044
01:46:07,626 --> 01:46:10,212
The deputy...

1045
01:46:10,295 --> 01:46:13,257
called out to him to stop...

1046
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:15,467
and Tom didn't stop.

1047
01:46:16,969 --> 01:46:19,680
He shot at him to wound him...

1048
01:46:19,763 --> 01:46:21,890
and missed his aim.

1049
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:27,396
Killed him.

1050
01:46:31,692 --> 01:46:33,610
The deputy says...

1051
01:46:37,197 --> 01:46:40,159
Tom just ran like a crazy man.

1052
01:46:50,127 --> 01:46:52,504
The last thing I told him
was not to lose heart...

1053
01:46:52,588 --> 01:46:54,882
that we'd ask for an appeal.

1054
01:47:04,016 --> 01:47:06,560
We had such a good chance.

1055
01:47:10,939 --> 01:47:13,901
We had more than a good chance.

1056
01:47:28,957 --> 01:47:31,335
I have to go out
and tell his family.

1057
01:47:32,503 --> 01:47:35,005
You look after
the children, Maudie.

1058
01:47:40,594 --> 01:47:43,430
Atticus, you want me
to go with you?

1059
01:47:43,514 --> 01:47:46,934
No, son. I think l'd better
go out there alone.

1060
01:47:50,396 --> 01:47:52,356
I'm goin' with you.

1061
01:47:54,274 --> 01:47:56,235
All right, son.

1062
01:48:19,591 --> 01:48:23,012
Hello, Mr Finch.
I'm Spence, Tom's father.

1063
01:48:24,096 --> 01:48:26,015
Hello, Spence.

1064
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,019
- Is Helen here?
- Yes, sir.

1065
01:48:30,144 --> 01:48:33,439
She's inside lyin' down,
tryin' to get a little sleep.

1066
01:48:33,522 --> 01:48:36,025
We been talkin'
about the appeal, Mr Finch.

1067
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:38,360
How long do you think it'll take?

1068
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:45,993
There isn't going
to be any appeal.

1069
01:48:47,328 --> 01:48:50,539
Not now. Tom is dead.

1070
01:48:50,622 --> 01:48:52,291
Dead?

1071
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:32,915
Boy.

1072
01:49:34,667 --> 01:49:38,587
Go inside and tell Atticus Finch
l said to come out here.

1073
01:49:39,713 --> 01:49:41,382
Go on, boy.

1074
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,441
By October, things
had settled down again.

1075
01:51:23,901 --> 01:51:28,405
I still looked for Boo everytime
I went bythe Radley place.

1076
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:36,413
This night my mind
was filled with Halloween.

1077
01:51:36,497 --> 01:51:40,501
There was to be a pageant representing
our county's agricultural products.

1078
01:51:41,543 --> 01:51:43,462
I was to be a ham.

1079
01:51:45,464 --> 01:51:48,842
Jem saidhe would escort me
to the school auditorium.

1080
01:51:50,469 --> 01:51:54,390
Thus began our longest
journey together.

1081
01:52:13,158 --> 01:52:15,202
- Scout.
- Yeah?

1082
01:52:16,328 --> 01:52:20,249
Will you come on?
Everybody's gone.

1083
01:52:20,332 --> 01:52:24,211
- I can't go home like this.
- Well, I'm going.

1084
01:52:24,294 --> 01:52:27,464
It's almost 1 0:00,
and Atticus will be waitin' for us.

1085
01:52:27,631 --> 01:52:30,259
All right, I'm comin'.

1086
01:52:30,342 --> 01:52:34,013
But I feel like a fool
walkin' home like this.

1087
01:52:34,096 --> 01:52:36,473
It's not my fault
you lost your dress.

1088
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:39,643
I didn't lose it.
Just can't find it.

1089
01:52:39,727 --> 01:52:43,439
- Where are your shoes?
- I can't find them either.

1090
01:52:43,522 --> 01:52:45,983
- You can get 'em tomorrow.
- But tomorrow's Sunday.

1091
01:52:46,066 --> 01:52:49,361
You can get the janitor
to let you in. Come on.

1092
01:53:17,014 --> 01:53:20,517
Here, Scout. Let me hold onto you
before you break your neck.

1093
01:53:24,521 --> 01:53:27,107
Jem, you don't have
to hold me.

1094
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:32,571
- What's the matter?
- Hush a minute, Scout.

1095
01:53:40,996 --> 01:53:43,415
I thought I heard somethin'.

1096
01:53:46,627 --> 01:53:47,670
Come on.

1097
01:53:59,431 --> 01:54:01,517
Wait.

1098
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:05,104
Are you trying to scare me?
You know I'm too old.

1099
01:54:05,187 --> 01:54:06,855
Be quiet.

1100
01:54:09,608 --> 01:54:12,111
- I hear an old dog bayin'.
- It's not that.

1101
01:54:12,194 --> 01:54:14,947
I hear it when
we're walkin' along.

1102
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:17,366
When we stop,
l don't hear it anymore.

1103
01:54:18,409 --> 01:54:21,912
Oh, yeah, my costume rustlin'.

1104
01:54:21,996 --> 01:54:24,373
Halloween's got ya.

1105
01:54:31,005 --> 01:54:33,007
I hear it now.

1106
01:54:33,090 --> 01:54:36,593
I'll bet it's just old
Cecil Jacobs tryin' to scare me.

1107
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:40,556
Cecil Jacobs is a big, wet hen!

1108
01:54:48,105 --> 01:54:49,606
Come on.

1109
01:55:29,688 --> 01:55:30,898
Run, Scout!

1110
01:55:30,981 --> 01:55:33,651
Run, Scout! Run! Run!

1111
01:57:27,514 --> 01:57:29,141
What happened?

1112
01:57:29,224 --> 01:57:31,685
I don't know.
I just don't know.

1113
01:57:33,437 --> 01:57:36,190
- Tell Dr Reynolds to come over.
- Yes, sir.

1114
01:57:38,609 --> 01:57:40,944
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:57:41,028 --> 01:57:43,238
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1116
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:53,999
Sheriff Tate, please.

1117
01:57:54,083 --> 01:57:56,502
Atticus, isJem dead?

1118
01:57:56,585 --> 01:57:59,213
No. He's unconscious.

1119
01:57:59,296 --> 01:58:02,341
We won't know how badly he's hurt
until the doctor gets here.

1120
01:58:02,466 --> 01:58:05,177
Heck? Atticus Finch.

1121
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:07,471
Someone's been after my children.

1122
01:58:10,641 --> 01:58:13,102
He's got a bad break,
as far as I can tell.

1123
01:58:13,185 --> 01:58:16,188
Like somebody tried
to wring his arm off.

1124
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:24,989
I'll be right back, Atticus.

1125
01:58:26,532 --> 01:58:29,618
- How's the boy, Doc?
- He'll be all right.

1126
01:58:32,413 --> 01:58:34,373
SheriffTate.

1127
01:58:53,976 --> 01:58:56,270
What is it, Heck?

1128
01:59:00,065 --> 01:59:02,943
Bob Ewell's lyin' on the ground
under that tree down yonder...

1129
01:59:02,985 --> 01:59:05,487
with a kitchen knife
stuck up under his ribs.

1130
01:59:09,158 --> 01:59:10,659
He's dead.

1131
01:59:25,758 --> 01:59:28,218
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1132
01:59:32,139 --> 01:59:34,725
He's not gonna bother
these children anymore.

1133
01:59:36,894 --> 01:59:39,355
Miss Scout, you think
you could tell us what happened?

1134
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,400
I don't know.

1135
01:59:43,484 --> 01:59:47,529
All ofa sudden somebody grabbed me,
knocked me down on the ground.

1136
01:59:47,613 --> 01:59:50,324
Jem found me then.

1137
01:59:50,407 --> 01:59:54,703
Then Mr Ewell, I reckon,
grabbed him again, and Jem hollered.

1138
01:59:54,828 --> 01:59:59,208
Then somebody grabbed me.
Mr Ewell, I guess.

1139
02:00:00,501 --> 02:00:02,419
Somebody grabbed him...

1140
02:00:02,503 --> 02:00:05,964
and then I heard someone
pantin' and coughin'.

1141
02:00:10,427 --> 02:00:12,346
Then I saw someone carryingJem.

1142
02:00:12,429 --> 02:00:14,640
Who was it?

1143
02:00:19,311 --> 02:00:20,938
There he is, Mr Tate.

1144
02:00:21,772 --> 02:00:24,733
He can tell you his name.

1145
02:00:51,427 --> 02:00:52,803
Hey, Boo.

1146
02:00:55,347 --> 02:00:59,018
MissJean Louise,
Mr Arthur Radley.

1147
02:01:01,353 --> 02:01:04,356
I believe he already knows you.

1148
02:01:13,991 --> 02:01:16,368
Heck, let's go out
on the front porch.

1149
02:01:28,422 --> 02:01:31,884
Would you like to say good night
toJem, Mr Arthur?

1150
02:01:55,157 --> 02:01:59,203
You can pet him, Mr Arthur.
He's asleep.

1151
02:01:59,244 --> 02:02:02,289
You couldn't if he was awake, though.
He wouldn't let you.

1152
02:02:06,502 --> 02:02:08,379
Go ahead.

1153
02:02:46,583 --> 02:02:49,086
Let's go sit in the swing,
Mr Arthur.

1154
02:02:56,427 --> 02:03:00,347
I guess the thing to do is--

1155
02:03:04,768 --> 02:03:08,605
Good Lord.
I must be losin' my memory.

1156
02:03:11,108 --> 02:03:15,738
I can't remember
whether Jem is 1 2 or 1 3.

1157
02:03:19,825 --> 02:03:22,703
Anyway, it'll have to...

1158
02:03:22,786 --> 02:03:25,247
come before the county court.

1159
02:03:28,459 --> 02:03:32,212
Of course, it's a clear-cut
case ofself-defence.

1160
02:03:33,714 --> 02:03:35,591
I'll run down to the office--

1161
02:03:35,674 --> 02:03:37,301
Mr Finch...

1162
02:03:38,427 --> 02:03:40,804
do you think Jem
killed Bob Ewell?

1163
02:03:40,888 --> 02:03:43,098
Is that what you think?

1164
02:03:45,059 --> 02:03:47,269
Your boy never stabbed him.

1165
02:04:04,662 --> 02:04:07,206
Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1166
02:04:08,624 --> 02:04:10,668
He killed himself.

1167
02:04:15,172 --> 02:04:18,092
There's a black man
dead for no reason.

1168
02:04:18,175 --> 02:04:21,804
Now the man responsible
for it is dead.

1169
02:04:21,887 --> 02:04:25,099
Let the dead bury the dead
this time, Mr Finch.

1170
02:04:25,182 --> 02:04:27,643
I never heard tell it was
against the law for any citizen...

1171
02:04:27,726 --> 02:04:30,396
to do his utmost to prevent
a crime from being committed...

1172
02:04:30,521 --> 02:04:32,773
which is exactly what he did.

1173
02:04:32,856 --> 02:04:35,818
Maybe you'll tell me it's my duty
to tell the town all about it...

1174
02:04:35,901 --> 02:04:38,112
not to hush it up.

1175
02:04:38,195 --> 02:04:40,781
You know what'll happen then.

1176
02:04:40,864 --> 02:04:44,994
All the ladies in Maycomb, includin'
my wife, will be knockin' on his door...

1177
02:04:45,077 --> 02:04:47,454
bringin' angel food cakes.

1178
02:04:47,579 --> 02:04:50,666
To my way of thinkin',
takin' one man...

1179
02:04:50,749 --> 02:04:53,585
who done you and this town
a big service...

1180
02:04:53,669 --> 02:04:57,423
and draggin' him
with his shy ways into the lime light--

1181
02:04:58,590 --> 02:05:01,427
To me, that's a sin.

1182
02:05:01,510 --> 02:05:03,721
It's a sin.

1183
02:05:03,804 --> 02:05:06,598
And I'm not about
to have it on my head.

1184
02:05:07,975 --> 02:05:10,769
I may not be much, Mr Finch...

1185
02:05:10,853 --> 02:05:14,356
but I'm still sheriff
of Maycomb County...

1186
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:17,526
and Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1187
02:05:18,819 --> 02:05:20,738
Good night, sir.

1188
02:05:59,526 --> 02:06:02,029
Mr Tate was right.

1189
02:06:06,617 --> 02:06:09,370
What do you mean?

1190
02:06:09,453 --> 02:06:12,665
Well, it would be...

1191
02:06:12,790 --> 02:06:16,543
sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it?

1192
02:06:45,447 --> 02:06:47,366
Thank you, Arthur.

1193
02:06:55,290 --> 02:06:57,584
Thank you for my children.

1194
02:07:12,641 --> 02:07:15,769
Neighbours bring food
with death...

1195
02:07:15,853 --> 02:07:18,731
and flowers with sickness...

1196
02:07:18,814 --> 02:07:21,650
and little things in between.

1197
02:07:21,734 --> 02:07:24,361
Boo was our neighbour.

1198
02:07:24,445 --> 02:07:27,197
He gave us two soap dolls...

1199
02:07:27,281 --> 02:07:30,117
a broken watch and chain...

1200
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,745
a knife...

1201
02:07:32,828 --> 02:07:34,788
and our lives.

1202
02:07:40,127 --> 02:07:43,839
One time Atticus said
you never really knew a man...

1203
02:07:43,922 --> 02:07:47,051
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them.

1204
02:07:52,848 --> 02:07:56,393
Just standin'
on the Radley porch was enough.

1205
02:08:03,734 --> 02:08:07,196
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended...

1206
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:09,948
and another summer
had taken its place...

1207
02:08:10,115 --> 02:08:11,950
anda fall.

1208
02:08:12,117 --> 02:08:14,620
And Boo Radley had come out.

1209
02:08:18,749 --> 02:08:22,002
I was to think
of these days many times...

1210
02:08:22,127 --> 02:08:24,171
of Jem and Dill...

1211
02:08:24,296 --> 02:08:26,924
and Boo Radley and Tom Robinson.

1212
02:08:29,343 --> 02:08:31,303
And Atticus.

1213
02:08:39,645 --> 02:08:42,481
He would be in Jem's room
all night...

1214
02:08:43,649 --> 02:08:47,945
and he would be there
when Jem waked up in the morning.
