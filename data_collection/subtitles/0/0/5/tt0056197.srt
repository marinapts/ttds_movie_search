1
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:31,289
London calling... with Frenchmen
speaking to their countrymen.

2
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:49,172


3
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,767
Take a look at that! What
a handsome sight...

4
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:34,325
...the pride of the Third Reich!

5
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:38,324
The brave sergeant taking
coffee to the beachgunners.

6
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:43,650
So that's a sample of the
master race! In a pig's eye!

7
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:16,605


8
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:46,893


9
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:28,528
In this darkest hour, in
the gloom of night...

10
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:30,566
...we must not despair.

11
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,093
For each of us...

12
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:42,974
...deliverance is coming!

13
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:13,292
We need mines and obstacles
along the whole coast.

14
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:16,373
At every beach, on every dune...

15
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,765
...on every rock.

16
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,966
How many have been installed?

17
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:23,643
Four million, Herr Field Marshal.

18
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:33,526
The work has completely
exhausted our troops.

19
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,006
Which would your troops rather be...

20
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:40,171
...exhausted or dead?

21
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,331
Just look at it, gentlemen.

22
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,771
How calm... how peaceful it is.

23
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:48,690
A strip of water between
England and the Continent...

24
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:50,806
...between the Allies and us.

25
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:56,570
But beyond that peaceful
horizon... a monster waits!

26
00:04:56,895 --> 00:05:00,444
A coiled spring of men,
ships and planes...

27
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:03,653
...straining to be released against us.

28
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,808
But not a single Allied soldier
shall reach the shore.

29
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:17,687
Whenever or wherever this invasion
may come, gentlemen...

30
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:23,006
...I shall destroy the enemy
there... at the water's edge!

31
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:25,694
Believe me, gentlemen.

32
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:29,205
The first 24 hours of the
invasion will be decisive.

33
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:34,171
For the Allies as well as the Germans,
it will be the longest day...

34
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,370
...the longest day!

35
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,534
The poem by Verlaine?

36
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,134
Play it back!

37
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:28,167
Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.

38
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:32,970
Here are some personal messages.

39
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:39,564
"The long sobs of the violins of autumn. "

40
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,010
I repeat:

41
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:44,890
"The long sobs of the violins of autumn. "

42
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,845
Have you notified all commands?

43
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:03,205
If Berlin is right,
when we intercept the second verse...

44
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:07,528
...it will mean the invasion
will come within 24 hours.

45
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:10,007
Give me the text of the second verse.

46
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,404


47
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:28,925
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

48
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:35,493
We've intercepted hundreds of messages
in the last year... hundreds!

49
00:07:35,695 --> 00:07:38,767
I've ordered alerts again and again.

50
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:42,854
Why should this poem mean more
than other messages?

51
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:44,454
Tell me this:

52
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:49,126
Does it give us any clue as to
where they will land and when?

53
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,610
Of course it doesn't.

54
00:07:54,535 --> 00:08:00,246
How can I maintain discipline if
I keep my troops on the alert...

55
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:04,973
...just because a pair of nitwits
in Berlin intercept a poem?

56
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:08,969
No, Blumentritt... no alert!

57
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:13,205
And especially not in this weather!

58
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,690
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

59
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:35,688
Good morning, Field Marshal.

60
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,726
- Any news?
- Nothing important.

61
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,608
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-
Calais yesterday afternoon.

62
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:44,012
Nothing much happened
last night... the storm.

63
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:47,890
That's all I'm interested in
this morning... the storm.

64
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:53,374
It came from nowhere...
blew my roses to bits.

65
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,089
There are five-foot waves
in the Channel...

66
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:00,765
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour.

67
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,325
For the month of June...

68
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,964
...it's the worst Channel
storm in 20 years.

69
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:08,484
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?

70
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,087
General Jodl will see the Fhrer today...

71
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:14,934
...and confirm the appointment for you.

72
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
Will you still go to Germany as planned?

73
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,329
Can you think of a better time?

74
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:27,726
The weather is expected to continue
like this for another week.

75
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:14,733
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

76
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:17,094
Snap it up.

77
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:18,967
Jerk the lead.

78
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:20,733
Snap it up.

79
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:21,890
Jerk the lead.

80
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:24,325
You expect us to eat this slop again?

81
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,327
I don't care what you do with it, mac.

82
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,247
Eat it, throw it out.

83
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,968
I get paid for cooking it.

84
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,847
Come on. Put it on.

85
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:35,568
Snap it up.

86
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:37,094
Jerk the lead.

87
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,047
Didn't you get any sleep?

88
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:42,088
Are you kidding? I haven't slept
since we got here.

89
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:46,523
I got the absolute lowdown.

90
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:49,654
It's on for tonight. For sure.

91
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:51,129
Yeah.

92
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:54,567
I got in this crap game
with this guy from F Company.

93
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:58,450
- He's an orderly for some general.
- Move it. Move it.

94
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,694
Hey, Hutchy!

95
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,886
Hutchy, I want to ask you something.

96
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:08,213
Hey, Hutchinson...

97
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:11,970
...do you think they'd let me write
home? If it was really important?

98
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:15,087
Not likely, mate. Security.

99
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:17,445
I don't think old Churchill trusts us.

100
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:20,215
It's the wife, you see.
She's going to have a baby.

101
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:21,524
Your first, is it?

102
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:24,852
Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead
worried about her.

103
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,171
She's not too strong, you see.

104
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:54,209
Man, that stink.

105
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:58,689
Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit.

106
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:02,003
And there ain't no place left
to get sick in.

107
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,453
The puke bags is full.

108
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,850
The fire buckets is full.

109
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:10,689
All we got left is our helmets.

110
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,374
June.

111
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:20,965
Every June my old man
used to take me camping...

112
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,523
...up in the Blue Mountains.

113
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:29,574
We'd hunt and fish all day long.

114
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:32,933
And at night...

115
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:36,768
...we'd sleep out under the stars.

116
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,365
Didn't even need a blanket.

117
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,288
June.

118
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:54,815
Wind and rain. Wind and rain.

119
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,334
Don't it ever stop?

120
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,567
Look, Dad, all I want
to do is get going.

121
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,768
Wind or no wind. Even if we land
in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.

122
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:06,370
- Come to think of it...
- Colonel wants us.

123
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:08,247
All of us.

124
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,209
All troops will participate
in ground tactics and deployment.

125
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,446
In this weather, sir?

126
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,931
Of course, Harding, if you can ensure
that we'll land in France...

127
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:34,649
...in sunshine and dry weather.
- Didn't mean that.

128
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,130
- What did you mean?
- It isn't the weather.

129
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,247
It's the waiting.
These men are itching to go.

130
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:42,810
I don't think I have to remind you...

131
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:46,212
...that this war has been going on
for almost five years.

132
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:48,730
Half of Europe has been
overrun and occupied.

133
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:51,290
We're comparative newcomers.

134
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:55,613
England's gone through a blitz with
a knife at her throat since 1940.

135
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:59,888
I am quite sure that they too
are impatient and itching to go.

136
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:01,847
Do I make myself clear?

137
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:03,608
Yes, sir. Quite clear.

138
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:07,447
Three million men penned up
on this island.

139
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:11,204
All over England,
in staging areas like this.

140
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,448
We're on the threshold
of the most crucial day of our times.

141
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,771
Three million men out there...

142
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:22,651
...keyed up, and waiting for
that big step-off.

143
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:27,011
They aren't exactly alone.

144
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:31,373
Notify the men. Full packs
and equipment, 14:00 hours.

145
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:32,684
Yes, sir.

146
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:38,645


147
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:40,447
This allows you more freedom.

148
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:43,692
Quicker to get rid of
when we hit the beach.

149
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,252
- Well?
- It's on.

150
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,126
Tonight, as scheduled.

151
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:52,004
- providing the weather isn't worse.
- How worse can it get?

152
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:55,287
Ike has called a high-level
conference for 9:30.

153
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:59,568
I am not Eisenhower. I am
an assistant division commander.

154
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:04,291
I don't know from nothing,
but he can't call it off again.

155
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:09,568
Frank, turn that thing off.

156
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,084
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.

157
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:13,808
Troops ready to go.

158
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,767
Eleven thousand planes on the line.

159
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:19,445
Eighteen thousand paratroopers.
God only knows how many gliders.

160
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,646
Norm, relax.

161
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:26,129
RAF says the gale can stop
as suddenly as it began.

162
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,565
So they told us yesterday
and the day before.

163
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:30,208
Look, Norm.

164
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,326
We're all of us just as...

165
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,931
...dedicated to this thing as you are,
just as anxious to get going.

166
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,046
And that includes Ike.

167
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:42,088
Now if he calls it off again,
he knows what he's doing.

168
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,889
Of course he does. I know that.

169
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:48,724
I'm just thinking about those
assault troops. 200,000 of them...

170
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:52,166
...out there on those ships.
They're probably seasick as hell.

171
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,004
Some of those men have been
on those tubs for almost three days.

172
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,367
I say go.

173
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:01,083
Go. Weather or no weather.

174
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,808


175
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:04,204
No!

176
00:16:05,735 --> 00:16:07,532
A hundred on the bone! Let's go.

177
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:11,523
- Hey, give me $50. I'm busted.
- I'm not doing so good myself.

178
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,013
Hey, lend me $50?

179
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,483
- Lend me 20 bucks?
- Drop dead.

180
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:36,654
Lend me $ 10?

181
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,688
Let's go, let's go. Six!

182
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,174
- Fifty on a bet.
- I got it.

183
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,331
One, two, three, four, five.

184
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,167
Fifty!

185
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:53,046
Let me hear it, let me hear it.

186
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:56,565
- Five and two, four and three.
- Six! That's the way we go!

187
00:16:56,775 --> 00:17:00,085
Seven points in a row. It ain't
logical, it just ain't logical.

188
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:05,005
- There's a hundred out there.
- $ 100 dollars, $20 dollars.

189
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:06,694
Anything open?

190
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,772
- Forty more.
- Forty more.

191
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:10,567
You got a bet.

192
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:14,731
- Okay, you mother-Ioving...
- Just a minute. Wait a minute.

193
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,167
Here you are. Use this.

194
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,730
- You don't think I'd...
- I don't think anything.

195
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:23,132
I just like to hear the sound
when it comes out of the cup.

196
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:26,812
That's it. Shake it.

197
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:31,485
Okay. Let me see what you do
with it now. Go ahead. Shoot.

198
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,208
- What is it?
- Nothing.

199
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,203
- Seven!
- That's what I wanted!

200
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,605
Who put this cup in the game?

201
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:40,494
- Next shooter. Who's coming up?
I'll go $ 100.

202
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:43,163
He's shooting a hundred.
Who's got it?

203
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,650
- Watch your side bets.
- $ 100.

204
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:49,809
You got a letter for me.
Schultz, huh?

205
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:53,054
Yeah, that's it.

206
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,804
Thanks, buddy.

207
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,090
Mama mia!

208
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:07,368
- How much did you take him for?
- Not much. Just a hair over $2500.

209
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:09,852
- $2500?
- Yeah.

210
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,330
Oh, man, $2500?

211
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:15,486
It's too bad you had to win it now.

212
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,169
What do you mean, now?

213
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,333
Suppose we take off tonight.
What will you do with it?

214
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:25,646
Five I take with me to Paris
to blow on the broads and wine.

215
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,210
A thou I leave here for seed
when I get back.

216
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,491
And the rest I send to my mother.

217
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:55,205
Oh, man, $2500. And in Paris.

218
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:57,013
You always was lucky.

219
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:59,046
Hey, remember that night
in Fort Bragg?

220
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,289
I remember it.

221
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:08,007
You know, I think I sneak over there
and give it a big whang myself.

222
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:10,086
Why not? What's to lose?

223
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:15,014
Damn it.

224
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,533
Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?

225
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:24,807
I was lucky, all right,
in that crap game.

226
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:29,529
Next day I break my leg in a jump.

227
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:32,211
And two months in traction.

228
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,771
$2500.

229
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,767
That's more money I ever had
in my whole life.

230
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:57,814
I know.

231
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:01,855
Man, I just know.

232
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:17,892
I wonder how long it takes
to lose $2500?

233
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,767
Pint of sludge, Ted.

234
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:41,494
Oh, hello, Dave.
Hey, you seen Johnny?

235
00:20:41,695 --> 00:20:42,889
Yes.

236
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,372
Well, where is he?

237
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:48,654
Come on, Dave.

238
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:51,325
I need my boots.
Johnny's borrowed them.

239
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,453
Where is he?

240
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,414
At the bottom...

241
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,173
...of the Channel.

242
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:08,090
You mean...

243
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:10,969
...he's bought it?

244
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,370
Ack-ack over Calais.

245
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:17,454
He jumped clean,
but his parachute didn't open.

246
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:28,130
That leaves just you
in the squadron, Dave.

247
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:32,605
I mean, of the old 1940 mob.

248
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:35,534
What's always worried me
about being one of the few...

249
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:38,203
...is the way we keep on
getting fewer.

250
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:41,003
Yeah.

251
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,013
Poor old Johnny.

252
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:45,884
Bad luck, it happening now.

253
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:50,327
- Now, then. What's the difference?
- He went through the Battle of Britain!

254
00:21:52,055 --> 00:21:54,728
And now if the big show
starts tonight...

255
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,766
...he won't be in it.

256
00:21:57,575 --> 00:21:59,611
Look, will you please
shut up about him?

257
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:02,045
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

258
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:04,447
You heard something about tonight?

259
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:07,484
No, no. I haven't heard anything.

260
00:22:07,735 --> 00:22:10,807
- What are you talking about then?
- Well, it's just...

261
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:14,372
- Go on, go on.
- I have a feeling it's on for tonight.

262
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:16,924
- That's all.
- A feeling.

263
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:19,332
Take your feeling somewhere else.

264
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:22,167
I've got a letter to write.

265
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,935
I've had this feeling since I woke up.

266
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,206
I've had it with me all day long.

267
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:29,573
I can't shake it off.

268
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:33,292
It's tonight. I know it is.

269
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:35,213
All right, it's tonight.

270
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,729
Suits me fine.

271
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:39,654
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!

272
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:42,974
I mean...

273
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:46,685
...as soon as I finish this beer.

274
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,974
- General, can you spare me a minute?
- Come in.

275
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,813
- Thank you.
- Can I get you coffee?

276
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:07,165
- No, thanks.
- I'll get some for myself.

277
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:18,970
Is it still raining?

278
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,688
On and off, off and on.

279
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:23,409
Sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

280
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:24,604
What?

281
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:29,050
I say, sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

282
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,452
Good question.

283
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:33,088
What's on your mind, Van?

284
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:36,253
I'm concerned about the placement
of our drop zones.

285
00:23:36,455 --> 00:23:37,649
Go on.

286
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:41,291
I know this is a hell of a late date
to bring up something new...

287
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,725
...but you've given me
a tough nut to crack.

288
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:47,325
- It gets tougher every time I try.
- I know, Van.

289
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:50,965
Sainte-Mre-Eglise straddles
the only road the Germans can use...

290
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:54,531
...to drive into our northern flank.
But it has to be taken.

291
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:56,772
And it has to be held.

292
00:23:58,095 --> 00:24:00,450
That's why I gave you the job, Van.

293
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,011
- Can I use your board?
- Of course.

294
00:24:10,695 --> 00:24:13,687
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.

295
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:17,171
Down here is the swamp area
that the Germans have flooded.

296
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:21,163
And in between, four miles
from the town, is our drop zone.

297
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,684
Now if anything goes wrong
and we undershoot...

298
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,648
...we land in this flooded area
and are bogged down.

299
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:29,972
If we overshoot, we come down
like clay pigeons...

300
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:33,008
...smack dab in the center
of Sainte-Mre-Eglise.

301
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:37,572
That's why I gave the men training
in low-level jumps near the villages.

302
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,288
So I've heard.

303
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:44,965
Got a complaint from
the city council at Bexhall.

304
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:49,612
Some of your men overshot
the drop zone and landed in the town.

305
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:53,490
- Tied up traffic for an hour.
- That's true, sir. I was with them.

306
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:56,454
Sudden crosswind hit us,
swept us over the treetops...

307
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:58,646
...scattered us all over the place.

308
00:25:00,255 --> 00:25:04,965
- Where did you end up?
- In the courtyard of a convent.

309
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:07,846
Relax, Van. Sit down.

310
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,963
The last few months have been
a tough grind on all of us.

311
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:16,692
I hear you've been working yourself
and your battalion hard.

312
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,851
Almost without a stop.

313
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,935
Now that we're almost
at the end of the line...

314
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:26,286
...why don't you try easing up
on yourself and on the men?

315
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,165
Sometimes a battalion can be
sharpened to too fine a point.

316
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:33,333
Sometimes a commander can too.

317
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:36,770
Well...

318
00:25:38,055 --> 00:25:41,445
...if there's any further delay...

319
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:45,250
...I request permission to submit
a new placement for our drop zones.

320
00:25:45,495 --> 00:25:47,531
All right. Put it in writing.

321
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:50,010
Make it official.
That's your prerogative.

322
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:55,490
But Ike has called a final meeting
for tonight at Southwick House.

323
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:58,495
If it's on, we'll get
the green light by 9:30.

324
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:01,368
- What are the chances?
- Better than 50-50.

325
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:05,648
Forget everything I said. I got
the best battalion in this division...

326
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,810
...and they're ready.

327
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:24,085
Here it is. The latest report.

328
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:35,886


329
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:44,808
- It's Southwick House, sir.
- Stagg here.

330
00:26:45,215 --> 00:26:48,685
Yes, sir. The new front's moving in
much faster than we thought.

331
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:51,890
Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.

332
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:55,530
I'll be there, sir. 9:30.

333
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:05,370
- Would you like some more tea, sir?
- Coffee, and make it black.

334
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:06,530
Please.

335
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:08,732
One moment, Colonel Priller.

336
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:11,491
Why wasn't he court-martialed?

337
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,572
He shot down 132 planes.

338
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:20,253
Don't call me "Pips, old boy. "

339
00:27:20,495 --> 00:27:23,771
You were a rotten pilot
when we flew in Russia.

340
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,365
You're flying a desk now, but
you're still a rotten pilot!

341
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:30,525
What's that you're saying?

342
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:34,853
I'm squatting here on this
God-forsaken airfield...

343
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:39,367
...with only two planes...
two stinking crates!

344
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:44,172
Oh, sure, sure... your
orders were followed!

345
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,570
Now my squadrons are God-knows-where!

346
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:51,970
My supplies are all gone. What
am I supposed to do now?

347
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:57,169
But Pips, we had to disperse our
fighter squadrons... we had to!

348
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:01,527
Look what happened to our airstrips
around the Pas-de-Calais!

349
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:04,454
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!

350
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:08,689
You move us back instead of forward!

351
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:13,605
Sure, I know the weather's lousy
and they probably won't invade...

352
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:16,807
...but what would happen if they did?

353
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:21,014
But you know I can't get there
with my equipment for two days.

354
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:24,730
I tell you, you're all crazy!

355
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,529
Priller has always been a hothead...

356
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:47,374
...but let's not underestimate him.

357
00:28:48,255 --> 00:28:50,974
What he says is not entirely illogical.

358
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:53,613
What's the weather report?

359
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,045
Slightly better over the Channel.

360
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,085
I wouldn't be surprised if...

361
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:04,450
- When's the next weather report?
- Tonight at 8, General.

362
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,809
Keep me posted on the weather.

363
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:10,811
You made my dinner reservations?

364
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,733
Yes, I did, General.

365
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:14,527
Cancel everything.

366
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,967


367
00:29:28,175 --> 00:29:33,533
Shoes for my wife, I had them
specially made in Paris...

368
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:38,445
...for her birthday... tomorrow,
the sixth of June.

369
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:40,964
Please wish her a happy birthday.

370
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,574
Thank you, Speidel.

371
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,885
Why didn't they attack in May?
The weather was perfect...

372
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,725
An attack now would be embarrassing.

373
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:59,053
But I don't think we need worry.

374
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,048
Is the plan ready, sir?

375
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:25,726
Yes, yes, quite finished.

376
00:30:27,295 --> 00:30:28,774
War games...

377
00:30:30,255 --> 00:30:32,485
...theoretical invasions.

378
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:39,206
Rush to Rennes just to push
little flags around a table.

379
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:43,926
Playing at war!

380
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:48,165
Do you win or lose, sir?

381
00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:50,888
Have I ever lost?

382
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:59,290
But General, this time you play
the role of Eisenhower.

383
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:03,132
I win because I go against the rules.

384
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:07,730
We expect them to cross at the
narrowest part of the Channel...

385
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:12,611
...and in good weather. But that's
too simple... too obvious.

386
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:17,730
I choose the widest part, in the
worst weather... and attack here.

387
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:20,174
In Normandy.

388
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:22,167
And in bad weather!

389
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:27,489
Like now...

390
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:29,483
...bad weather!

391
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,892
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.

392
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:38,086
From a meteorological standpoint,
conditions almost resemble mid-winter.

393
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:39,444
And Normandy?

394
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:43,091
High winds, clouds,
and some fog over the beaches.

395
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:47,254
However, I can say with a certain
degree of safety...

396
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,612
...that we can expect a brief period
of fair conditions.

397
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:52,726
Let me summarize, then.

398
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:57,891
What you're promising us is a barely
tolerable period of fair conditions.

399
00:31:58,175 --> 00:31:59,164
Am I right?

400
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,444
Yes.

401
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:04,125
Conditions that are far below
the minimum requirements.

402
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:06,644
That's all I can promise.

403
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:10,131
You've done your best, Stagg.
Thank you, gentlemen.

404
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:15,810
Well...

405
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,568
...there it is.

406
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:21,213
We've postponed the attack
once already.

407
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:25,688
Now, either we go on the 6th,
with only marginal conditions...

408
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,327
...or postpone again...

409
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:31,164
...in the hope of getting
perfect conditions.

410
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,967
What do you think, Monty?

411
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:35,166
I say, go. Go.

412
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,570
I must remind everybody...

413
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:41,529
...that the American convoy
for the Omaha and Utah beaches...

414
00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:43,532
...they've farthest to go...

415
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:46,886
...must be given the order
within the next half-hour...

416
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:50,132
...if the assault is to take place
on the 6th.

417
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:57,011
We can't keep almost a quarter
of a million men on ships...

418
00:32:57,215 --> 00:33:00,093
...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.

419
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:04,211
The longer we wait, the more
acute our security problem.

420
00:33:04,535 --> 00:33:06,093
The next time...

421
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:08,729
...the tides and the moon
will be right...

422
00:33:11,855 --> 00:33:13,368
Not before July.

423
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:18,124
Gentlemen...

424
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:21,926
...such a postponement...

425
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:26,169
...is too bitter to contemplate.

426
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:32,812
A brilliant plan, General.
Unorthodox, but brilliant.

427
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:37,774
Fortunately, it's only a game.

428
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:42,013
I don't think we have
much to worry about.

429
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:46,814
Eisenhower would never
take the gamble.

430
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:48,894
Never.

431
00:33:53,175 --> 00:33:56,724
I'm quite positive
we must give the order.

432
00:33:58,055 --> 00:33:59,568
I don't like it...

433
00:33:59,975 --> 00:34:01,567
...but there it is.

434
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:03,289
Gentlemen...

435
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:08,054
...I don't see how we can possibly
do anything else but go.

436
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:22,769


437
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,808
Wilson speaking.

438
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:27,808
Yes, sir.

439
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:34,970
It's on, sir. Ike's made the
decision. Tonight, as scheduled!

440
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:37,325


441
00:34:40,055 --> 00:34:42,250


442
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:50,972
Colonel Tomson speaking.

443
00:34:54,855 --> 00:34:55,890
Thank you.

444
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:02,009
Next stop...

445
00:35:02,255 --> 00:35:03,688
...Normandy.

446
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:07,523
God help us now.

447
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,293


448
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,649
Gentlemen...

449
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:28,164
...the day we've been
waiting for has arrived.

450
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:31,169
Invasion! We're on our way.

451
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:38,524
General.

452
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:43,128
The orders have been given.
It's on.

453
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:48,209
Have the battalion commanders
join me in the wardroom.

454
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:00,248
All right, Sergeant.

455
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:05,128
You men are the eyes
of our airborne army.

456
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:10,086
You, the pathfinders, will have
one job, and one job only:

457
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,888
To light the drop zones
for our paratroops.

458
00:36:14,535 --> 00:36:17,686
Along with the British and Canadians
you'll be the first men...

459
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:20,614
...to land in France.
And remember this:

460
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:22,533
When you get to Normandy...

461
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:25,045
...you'll only have one friend:

462
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:26,890
God.

463
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:31,653
And this.

464
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:35,050
This...

465
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:38,374
...is Rupert.

466
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:42,005
Now, we are going to drop Rupert...

467
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:43,967
...and a lot more like him...

468
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:46,166
...behind the invasion area.

469
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:49,650
He's...

470
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:52,723
...a very extraordinary
fellow, Rupert.

471
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:55,487
He's sort of a...

472
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:58,050
...one-man army, all by himself.

473
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:00,249
Let me show you.

474
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:04,364
Let me show you what happens
when Rupert...

475
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:06,048
...hits the ground.

476
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:08,207
Sergeant, switch off
the lights, please.

477
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:17,608
All right, Sergeant, that's all.

478
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,206
All right, come on. Simmer down.

479
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:21,570
Come on, up.

480
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:23,731


481
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:30,645
It's possible that Rupert and his men
will do the same thing to the Germans.

482
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:33,688
Confuse them, make them look
over their shoulders...

483
00:37:33,895 --> 00:37:36,363
...and launch an attack
in the wrong direction.

484
00:37:36,575 --> 00:37:38,691


485
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:47,014
Ten-hut!

486
00:37:48,615 --> 00:37:51,368
- The crickets have been distributed.
- So I heard.

487
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:54,563
At ease!

488
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:59,614
You're as ready as we can make you.

489
00:38:00,975 --> 00:38:03,045
This five-cent toy...

490
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:05,969
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.

491
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:08,052
It may save your life.

492
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:10,730
You're gonna be landing in the dark.

493
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:13,930
On the other side of that hedgerow...

494
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:18,492
...the fellow may not be wearing
the same uniform you are. So...

495
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,253
...one click...

496
00:38:20,495 --> 00:38:22,963
...is to be answered by two clicks.

497
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,374
And if you don't
get that answering click...

498
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,851
...hit the dirt and open fire.

499
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:31,044
I repeat:

500
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:33,009
One click...

501
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:35,365
...must be answered by two clicks.

502
00:38:36,495 --> 00:38:40,124
Now, hang on to this gimmick.
It's as important as your weapon.

503
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:42,010
Do you read me?

504
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:44,092
Loud and clear, sir.

505
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:46,445
All right. One more thing.

506
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:49,169
Your assignment tonight is strategic.

507
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:52,209
You can't give the enemy a break.

508
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,172
Send them to hell.

509
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:02,047
That is all.

510
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:13,370
London calling
with messages for our friends.

511
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:22,889
"Molasses tomorrow will
bring forth cognac. "

512
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:30,128
"John has a long mustache. "

513
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:31,370
I repeat:

514
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:34,368
"John has a long mustache. "

515
00:39:35,815 --> 00:39:37,885
"John has a long mustache! "

516
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:41,571
"John has a long mustache! "

517
00:39:46,655 --> 00:39:49,169
"John has a long mustache! "

518
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:54,726
No, not yet...

519
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,294
Oh, my Lord!

520
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:20,090
"John has a long mustache. "

521
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,174
Shh.

522
00:40:28,735 --> 00:40:30,805


523
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:47,409


524
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:51,612
Make any sense to you, mac?

525
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:56,088
As I said last night, they're code
messages to the Resistance chaps.

526
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:59,133
Obviously, one message means
something to one group...

527
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:01,565
...and another means something
to another group.

528
00:41:02,455 --> 00:41:07,575
"There is a fire at the travel agency. "

529
00:41:07,855 --> 00:41:09,573
I repeat:

530
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:16,406
"There is a fire at the travel agency. "

531
00:41:17,695 --> 00:41:21,005
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

532
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:22,330
I repeat:

533
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:26,494
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

534
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:41,364
The bridge... in forty-five minutes.

535
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,651


536
00:41:49,895 --> 00:41:52,170
We'll be back.

537
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:03,651
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

538
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,654
I repeat:

539
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:09,530
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

540
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,848
"There is a fire at the travel agency. "

541
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:28,323
The best hand I've had all night.

542
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:30,691
Let me see here...

543
00:42:34,695 --> 00:42:35,969
Pardon me.

544
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:40,045
Pardon me, General... it's come!

545
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,530
Wait. Give that to me.

546
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:44,204
What's come?

547
00:42:44,455 --> 00:42:46,127
It's the second part of the message.

548
00:42:47,055 --> 00:42:48,693
The second verse.

549
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:51,489
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

550
00:42:52,815 --> 00:42:55,329
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

551
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,494
We can expect the invasion
within 24 hours!

552
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:04,485
Put the Fifteenth Army on full alert.

553
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:08,174
Thank you.

554
00:43:15,455 --> 00:43:20,483
You know, I'm too old a bunny to
get very excited about all this.

555
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:25,052
Now... where was I...?
Oh yes, two spades!

556
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,372
It's almost impossible to believe.

557
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:56,365
Every dot represents a ship.

558
00:43:57,015 --> 00:44:00,451
You got battlewagons, cruisers,
destroyers, minesweepers.

559
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:03,692
You got assault craft of every size
and every type.

560
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:08,295
The biggest armada
the world's ever known.

561
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:14,494
Here.

562
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,013
You remember it.

563
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:21,453
Remember every bit of it.

564
00:44:22,015 --> 00:44:23,573
We're on the eve of a day...

565
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:27,370
...that people will talk about
long after we're dead and gone.

566
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,133
You wanna know something?

567
00:44:40,975 --> 00:44:43,853
It gives me goose pimples
just to be part of it.

568
00:44:54,935 --> 00:44:56,766
You could call it one of them...

569
00:44:56,975 --> 00:44:59,887
...crazy, quickie wartime marriages,
you know?

570
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:03,167
Met at a dance at the USO
and all that...

571
00:45:03,455 --> 00:45:05,332
...but, I mean, I took it serious.

572
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:08,647
And so did she.
We didn't do it just for kicks.

573
00:45:08,935 --> 00:45:11,574
- When did you get the letter?
- Week ago.

574
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:12,844
Two weeks.

575
00:45:14,535 --> 00:45:17,572
Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her.

576
00:45:17,855 --> 00:45:21,484
You know, I mean, she's a high-class
model and all, and I...

577
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:27,085
I'm not the kind of guy
to get married that easy.

578
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,286
I mean, it wasn't no joke to me.

579
00:45:34,175 --> 00:45:38,726
But oh, man, we really had some
wonderful times together.

580
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:42,454
And you think she's got a boyfriend?

581
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:47,168
Well, she never actually said so...

582
00:45:47,775 --> 00:45:49,049
I mean...

583
00:45:50,855 --> 00:45:53,927
You think I was right?
I mean, was I fair?

584
00:45:54,135 --> 00:45:55,363
You, uh...

585
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:57,970
She can't get one
without your permission, right?

586
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,927
You gotta give your okay.

587
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:01,688
I know it's the law.

588
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:04,614
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.

589
00:46:11,175 --> 00:46:14,884
Well, I guess I better be
getting back to the outfit.

590
00:46:18,215 --> 00:46:19,648
Good luck.

591
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:22,568
You too.

592
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:36,207
Who was that guy?
The one you was talking to so long?

593
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,092
I don't know, Sparrow.

594
00:46:40,975 --> 00:46:43,489
I never saw him before in my life.

595
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:47,330


596
00:46:53,295 --> 00:46:55,763


597
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:09,449
Happy birthday, General...
from your staff!

598
00:47:10,415 --> 00:47:13,134


599
00:47:13,775 --> 00:47:14,969
Thank you.

600
00:47:17,695 --> 00:47:19,287
Will you cut the cake, sir?

601
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:23,287
I trust you don't
expect me to eat it, too!

602
00:47:23,495 --> 00:47:24,848


603
00:47:49,135 --> 00:47:50,250
What's that?

604
00:47:50,895 --> 00:47:54,968
Dummkopf, that's the "V for
victory" sign. Three dots and a dash.

605
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:57,166


606
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,014
Ain't you never heard
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?

607
00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:11,409


608
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:18,125
You'll find them all

609
00:48:18,335 --> 00:48:21,372
Doing the Lambeth Walk

610
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:38,804
Release point coming up, Major Howard.

611
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:41,171
Right, prepare for landing.

612
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:42,808
Cutting loose now.

613
00:48:43,015 --> 00:48:44,004
Roger and out.

614
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:01,494


615
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:07,130
Doing the Lambeth Walk.

616
00:49:09,975 --> 00:49:13,012
Major, I cannot overestimate
the importance of your task.

617
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:17,288
The Orne River Bridge must be captured
before the enemy can destroy it.

618
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:22,165
It's a vital military artery, and the
enemy has prepared it for demolition.

619
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:26,568
It must be taken by surprise
and captured intact.

620
00:49:27,095 --> 00:49:31,008
Your gliders will land at night,
without the benefit of ground support.

621
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:33,809
You will assault the garrison,
overwhelm it...

622
00:49:34,015 --> 00:49:36,085
...and hold until relieved.

623
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:38,611
Hold until relieved.

624
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,964
Major Howard!

625
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:41,813
There's the bridge coming up.

626
00:49:43,175 --> 00:49:44,847
Just on our left.

627
00:49:54,455 --> 00:49:56,093
Right, link your arms.

628
00:49:56,695 --> 00:49:57,844
Brace yourselves.

629
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:21,050
Feet up!

630
00:50:22,935 --> 00:50:24,084
Hang on!

631
00:51:21,695 --> 00:51:23,606


632
00:51:27,095 --> 00:51:28,164
Smoke screen. Smoke.

633
00:51:31,615 --> 00:51:34,607
Up the action, bucks!
Up the action, bucks!

634
00:51:44,455 --> 00:51:46,605
Right, Tom.
Over the bridge.

635
00:52:11,055 --> 00:52:12,886
Check for demolition charges!

636
00:52:48,895 --> 00:52:50,692
Hello! Hello!

637
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:54,566
Hello! Damn it! Hello!

638
00:52:54,855 --> 00:52:56,652
Hello! Hello!

639
00:52:58,015 --> 00:53:00,006


640
00:53:11,735 --> 00:53:12,724
Clear.

641
00:53:27,655 --> 00:53:29,327
It's working!

642
00:53:30,055 --> 00:53:32,330
Hello! Hello!

643
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:36,765
Where's the doc?

644
00:53:36,975 --> 00:53:39,284
On the third glider.
There's no report from them.

645
00:53:39,855 --> 00:53:40,685
Walsh.

646
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:41,850
Sir?

647
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:44,615
Tom, Ruskin and Royal have had it.
Take over.

648
00:53:44,815 --> 00:53:46,567
- On the other end of the bridge.
- All right.

649
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:49,050
- What happened to you?
- Broke it on landing.

650
00:53:49,255 --> 00:53:51,485
- Isn't the doc with you?
- No, he's missing.

651
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,971
We crashed in the river.
Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.

652
00:53:55,615 --> 00:53:57,492
I'm all right, sir.
So are the boys.

653
00:53:57,695 --> 00:54:00,892
- Okay, carry on.
- Right, sir. Come on!

654
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:24,653
Well, I'll be...

655
00:54:25,215 --> 00:54:26,694
Hey, doc! Doc!

656
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:29,925
What are you doing there?
That's the German side.

657
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:32,968
Sir, anybody can make a mistake.

658
00:54:43,335 --> 00:54:44,370
Sir?

659
00:54:44,575 --> 00:54:47,647
The demolition charges have
been removed. It's all clear.

660
00:54:47,855 --> 00:54:49,573
Good. Corporal Smith.

661
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:54,930
Send out the success code words.
Keep sending until acknowledged.

662
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,804
- John, set up HQ in that pillbox.
- Right, sir.

663
00:55:04,255 --> 00:55:06,689
All in less than 15 minutes.

664
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,971
Only a matter of time before
they counterattack.

665
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:16,168
- What about the paratroopers?
- 7th Para might not get here for hours.

666
00:55:16,535 --> 00:55:18,526
And Lovat and his commandos...

667
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,684
It could be midday
before they get here.

668
00:55:22,975 --> 00:55:25,284
The question is,
how long can we hold?

669
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:27,773
Hold until relieved.

670
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:30,527
Hold until relieved.

671
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:42,567
It's raining again.

672
00:55:42,775 --> 00:55:43,924
Thank you.

673
00:55:44,535 --> 00:55:46,127
Did you get the list?

674
00:55:50,175 --> 00:55:54,851
Gen. Schlieben of the 709th has
already left for the war games.

675
00:55:55,495 --> 00:56:01,092
The Commander of the 243rd
left for Rennes at 18:00 hours.

676
00:56:01,935 --> 00:56:05,610
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd...
twelve officers in all.

677
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:08,606
Yes, I know.

678
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:13,493
The weather is bad, so everyone
enjoys an extra night in Rennes.

679
00:56:14,695 --> 00:56:16,208
I don't like it.

680
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:17,729
Any of it.

681
00:56:17,935 --> 00:56:21,007
So many key officers are
away at the same time.

682
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,285
I don't know why, but I don't like it.

683
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,452
But the war games have been
scheduled for a week...

684
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:31,284
Yes, for tomorrow... not tonight.

685
00:56:33,575 --> 00:56:37,090
Advise all officers who have
not yet left for Rennes...

686
00:56:37,295 --> 00:56:40,173
...to postpone their
departure until tomorrow.

687
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,094
May I remind you, General...

688
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:46,890
...that the Allies have always landed
in perfect weather conditions.

689
00:56:47,095 --> 00:56:51,008
North Africa... Sicily... Italy...

690
00:56:51,735 --> 00:56:53,168
Yes, and always at dawn!

691
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:04,128
We're 11 minutes from the green light.

692
00:57:04,335 --> 00:57:06,451
Now, once more, I repeat:

693
00:57:06,975 --> 00:57:10,285
If, for any reason, we fail
to hit our drop zones...

694
00:57:10,535 --> 00:57:12,287
...move north by east.

695
00:57:12,655 --> 00:57:14,327
North by east.

696
00:57:14,815 --> 00:57:18,205
The Germans have flooded large
swamp areas behind the coast.

697
00:57:18,455 --> 00:57:20,525
Avoid them if possible.

698
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:23,488
We came here to fight, not to swim.

699
00:57:23,895 --> 00:57:25,214
Do you read me?

700
00:57:25,455 --> 00:57:26,683
Loud and clear, sir.

701
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:49,651
- How'd you make out?
- Huh?

702
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:51,892
How did you make out at the game?

703
00:57:52,655 --> 00:57:53,531
Oh.

704
00:57:53,735 --> 00:57:54,690
I lost.

705
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,245
Now we're both jumping clean.

706
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:20,810
I understand. And when will
the Field Marshal return?

707
00:58:22,695 --> 00:58:24,413
I see. Oh, well.

708
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:25,968
Just a moment.

709
00:58:27,655 --> 00:58:29,213
The radar report.

710
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:35,931
We are getting reports of
strong radar interference...

711
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:38,650
...and radio reception is jammed.

712
00:58:40,655 --> 00:58:44,887
I realize this has happened before,
but never this effectively!

713
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:46,010
And the...

714
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:50,174
Call the OB West? Very well.

715
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:54,131
Give my respects to the Field
Marshal when he returns.

716
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:26,850
Bye, Rupert.

717
00:59:27,055 --> 00:59:30,172
Do your duty for God, king,
and your country.

718
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:34,492
Call for reinforcements!
We're under attack!

719
01:00:41,735 --> 01:00:44,044


720
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:56,206
- Are we late?
- No, but...

721
01:01:56,415 --> 01:01:57,894
...we must hurry!

722
01:02:07,695 --> 01:02:09,287


723
01:03:06,855 --> 01:03:08,004
What is it?

724
01:03:12,975 --> 01:03:14,090
No, no.

725
01:03:15,055 --> 01:03:16,534
I'll go.

726
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:36,530
Stop!

727
01:03:37,695 --> 01:03:38,810
We said, stop!

728
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,126
Stop, or I'll shoot!

729
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:47,009
What are you doing here?

730
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:49,811
I live in that farm.

731
01:03:50,415 --> 01:03:53,248
Nobody lives in that farm.

732
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:57,049
- It's abandoned.
- Show me your papers.

733
01:03:58,535 --> 01:03:59,934
Hurry up!

734
01:04:04,895 --> 01:04:06,487
Come with me.

735
01:04:06,935 --> 01:04:08,084
Go on!

736
01:04:34,175 --> 01:04:36,450


737
01:04:46,095 --> 01:04:48,006
Put your bicycle there.

738
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,044
Hans!

739
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,892
Hans, where are you?

740
01:04:54,175 --> 01:04:57,212
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!

741
01:04:57,775 --> 01:05:00,084
Who is with you? I want to know!

742
01:05:09,055 --> 01:05:10,283
Stop!

743
01:05:10,735 --> 01:05:11,963
Stop!

744
01:05:24,215 --> 01:05:25,534
Stop!

745
01:05:25,735 --> 01:05:27,646


746
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,090
Stop!

747
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:32,933
Stop!

748
01:05:40,655 --> 01:05:41,849


749
01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:21,685
Good luck at the war games, General.

750
01:06:24,335 --> 01:06:26,007
Anything important?

751
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:29,924
Communications reports difficulty
in contacting our forward posts.

752
01:06:31,215 --> 01:06:33,092
The Underground again!

753
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:38,172
Some sort of rubber dummies have
been dropped by parachute.

754
01:06:38,735 --> 01:06:40,134
Rubber dummies!

755
01:06:41,935 --> 01:06:43,766
Connect me with General Richter!

756
01:06:43,975 --> 01:06:48,810
We can expect commando raids
and other diversionary tactics...

757
01:06:50,695 --> 01:06:54,085
...but I don't like this idea
of dummy parachutists.

758
01:07:00,415 --> 01:07:01,530
Are you certain?

759
01:07:02,855 --> 01:07:03,924
How many?

760
01:07:05,415 --> 01:07:06,973
What do you think of it?

761
01:07:11,455 --> 01:07:12,888
Paratroopers...

762
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:20,408
Put it over there.

763
01:07:27,095 --> 01:07:30,724
This is what they dropped, they
explode on contact with the earth.

764
01:07:30,935 --> 01:07:33,369
In the dark, they look like soldiers.

765
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:38,609
Perhaps these are what General
Richter saw, not real paratroopers.

766
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:52,249
When you create a diversion,
it's for a reason.

767
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:55,128
Connect me with General Pemsel!

768
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:00,450
Dummies...?!

769
01:08:00,935 --> 01:08:02,493
Rubber dummies!

770
01:08:04,335 --> 01:08:09,090
I agree with you, General.
I'll call you back.

771
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,126
What about my call to von Rundstedt?

772
01:08:13,335 --> 01:08:16,645
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.

773
01:08:20,415 --> 01:08:22,326
They wouldn't drop dummies...

774
01:08:22,535 --> 01:08:25,174
...unless it was to divert our
attention from something else.

775
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:26,808
In this weather?

776
01:08:27,015 --> 01:08:28,528
In any kind of weather!

777
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:31,608
I must get in touch with OB West.

778
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:05,688
Shh.

779
01:09:23,455 --> 01:09:26,447
They're enemy paratroopers!

780
01:09:38,535 --> 01:09:39,888


781
01:09:40,095 --> 01:09:41,926
Blimey, mate...

782
01:09:42,135 --> 01:09:45,093
...you'll wake up the whole blooming
German Army!

783
01:09:48,335 --> 01:09:49,814


784
01:10:20,495 --> 01:10:21,769
Fellas!

785
01:10:21,975 --> 01:10:23,647
I'm hung up!

786
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,324
Fellas!

787
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,605
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

788
01:10:38,815 --> 01:10:40,134
Okay.

789
01:10:41,015 --> 01:10:42,926


790
01:11:28,135 --> 01:11:30,365


791
01:11:46,255 --> 01:11:48,723


792
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,293


793
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:14,693
Where have you come from?

794
01:12:16,775 --> 01:12:18,413
Awfully sorry, old man.

795
01:12:18,655 --> 01:12:20,725
Simply landed here by accident.

796
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:24,413


797
01:12:27,015 --> 01:12:28,448
What's that?

798
01:12:29,255 --> 01:12:32,133
Sorry I startled you.
I'm trying to find my communion set.

799
01:12:32,335 --> 01:12:33,245
Your what?

800
01:12:33,455 --> 01:12:35,605
My communion set. I've lost it.

801
01:12:35,895 --> 01:12:38,614
Now listen, padre.
We've got no time to look for...

802
01:12:44,935 --> 01:12:47,210
I'm sure that it was here
that I lost it.

803
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:09,531
We're under fire, padre.
Don't you think we ought to...

804
01:13:09,735 --> 01:13:13,250
You go on, my boy. Go on.
I'm sure I shall only be a minute.

805
01:13:15,295 --> 01:13:17,411
Cor! Stuff a grouse.

806
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:23,447
I've got it! I've got it!

807
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,367
Glory be.

808
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:29,244
Now, my son, let's go
about God's work this night.

809
01:13:31,455 --> 01:13:32,774


810
01:13:40,975 --> 01:13:41,930
Pluskat.

811
01:13:46,015 --> 01:13:48,210
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?

812
01:13:48,775 --> 01:13:50,049


813
01:13:50,255 --> 01:13:51,688


814
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:53,294
Nothing that I've heard...

815
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:59,004
The usual bombing, but quite distant.

816
01:14:01,055 --> 01:14:03,250
Oh, yes, I can hear it.

817
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:06,128
Well, wait a minute.

818
01:14:06,335 --> 01:14:08,132
Yes, just a moment.

819
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:25,533
Flares... but a long way up the coast.

820
01:14:26,055 --> 01:14:28,967
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.

821
01:14:29,415 --> 01:14:31,883
There's probably nothing to it...

822
01:14:32,655 --> 01:14:36,967
...but we have had reports
of paratrooper landings.

823
01:14:37,175 --> 01:14:40,053
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.

824
01:14:40,615 --> 01:14:42,412
Thank you, sir.

825
01:14:43,255 --> 01:14:44,734


826
01:15:00,015 --> 01:15:02,131
Higher! Higher!

827
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:09,973
Louis, open your store.
We need more buckets!

828
01:15:14,975 --> 01:15:17,535
Mayor Renaud, you must
come with me immediately.

829
01:15:17,735 --> 01:15:21,011
- Is it important?
- Very important, Mayor Renaud.

830
01:15:30,695 --> 01:15:32,174
What's wrong, madam?

831
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:35,253
I was on my way to the
little house outside...

832
01:15:35,695 --> 01:15:38,448
Suddenly, I saw a man
fall from the sky.

833
01:15:38,695 --> 01:15:40,651
- A parachutist?
- Yes, that's right.

834
01:15:40,855 --> 01:15:42,254
He looked like a big white bird!

835
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,491
- British or German?
- What?

836
01:15:44,735 --> 01:15:46,965
The parachutist... was he
a friend or an enemy?

837
01:15:47,215 --> 01:15:50,685
I don't know. He disappeared
without a word. Just "Shh! "

838
01:15:51,015 --> 01:15:53,131
- Without a word?
- Just "Shh! "

839
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,607
Bonjour, madame...

840
01:16:03,015 --> 01:16:04,846
...je suis amricain.

841
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:07,252
Bonjour, mademoiselle...

842
01:16:07,815 --> 01:16:09,168
...je suis amricain.

843
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:13,206
We seem to be circling.

844
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:17,052
Maybe they're having difficulty
finding the drop zone.

845
01:16:18,135 --> 01:16:19,454
Je suis...

846
01:16:19,695 --> 01:16:21,014
...amricain.

847
01:16:21,215 --> 01:16:23,683
Je suis amricain.

848
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,210
Voulez-vous...

849
01:16:26,655 --> 01:16:27,610
...mademoiselle?

850
01:16:29,255 --> 01:16:30,210
Okay.

851
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:32,649
Go!

852
01:16:33,495 --> 01:16:34,723
Go!

853
01:16:36,135 --> 01:16:38,126
Go! Go!

854
01:16:40,015 --> 01:16:41,573


855
01:17:06,415 --> 01:17:08,007
Paratroopers!

856
01:17:08,655 --> 01:17:10,611


857
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:42,494


858
01:17:44,135 --> 01:17:45,807


859
01:19:38,175 --> 01:19:40,086


860
01:20:21,495 --> 01:20:22,689
Anything new?

861
01:20:22,895 --> 01:20:26,729
Heavy bombing over
Cherbourg as usual, sir...

862
01:20:27,135 --> 01:20:29,285
...and now near Caen.

863
01:20:29,495 --> 01:20:32,089
The lines to Stations 6
and 8 have been cut...

864
01:20:32,295 --> 01:20:34,331
...but the direct line is open.

865
01:20:51,895 --> 01:20:53,726
I'll stay for a while.

866
01:20:55,175 --> 01:20:58,292
- Would you like coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

867
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:09,164


868
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:37,966


869
01:21:38,175 --> 01:21:40,689
For God's sakes, padre,
stop that damn noise.

870
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:43,409
I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost.

871
01:21:43,655 --> 01:21:45,213
Well, who ain't? Now, come on.

872
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:01,333


873
01:22:24,975 --> 01:22:28,411


874
01:22:34,415 --> 01:22:36,167


875
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:38,530
Two clicks.

876
01:22:38,775 --> 01:22:40,811
I heard two clicks.

877
01:22:49,135 --> 01:22:51,091


878
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:26,567


879
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,214


880
01:24:02,695 --> 01:24:04,811


881
01:24:08,255 --> 01:24:09,483


882
01:24:09,695 --> 01:24:12,129


883
01:24:17,815 --> 01:24:18,930
Man...

884
01:24:19,135 --> 01:24:20,966
...am I glad to see you.

885
01:24:21,735 --> 01:24:24,647
- You guys the 82nd?
- No. This is the 101.

886
01:24:24,855 --> 01:24:26,129
101?

887
01:24:26,335 --> 01:24:27,563
Where's the 82nd?

888
01:24:27,775 --> 01:24:30,573
Look, bud, we don't even know
where our own outfit is.

889
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:31,924


890
01:24:32,135 --> 01:24:34,569
Well, somebody's shooting at somebody.

891
01:24:34,775 --> 01:24:36,208
Let's us go find this war.

892
01:24:36,415 --> 01:24:37,689
Come on.

893
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:00,969


894
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:09,408
Maybe they're Limeys
and ain't got no cricket.

895
01:25:12,015 --> 01:25:13,926
They must be our guys.

896
01:25:17,335 --> 01:25:18,734
Okay.

897
01:25:23,575 --> 01:25:25,884


898
01:25:39,975 --> 01:25:41,488
No.

899
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:57,603
Hey.

900
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:00,213
Hey, they were Germans.

901
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:14,288
Hundreds of planes have been
flying to my left and right.

902
01:26:14,495 --> 01:26:16,087
Toward Caen.

903
01:26:18,935 --> 01:26:23,929
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula...
something must be happening!

904
01:26:24,175 --> 01:26:29,124
But what, Pluskat, what?
I haven't the faintest idea.

905
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:34,484
Has anything been
observed on the beaches?

906
01:26:36,015 --> 01:26:38,654
No... nothing.

907
01:26:39,655 --> 01:26:41,885
Yes, I'll let you know right away.

908
01:26:42,095 --> 01:26:43,414
Of course.

909
01:26:50,655 --> 01:26:53,010
Are you positive that ankle's broken?

910
01:26:53,215 --> 01:26:54,853
Compound fracture, sir.

911
01:26:55,055 --> 01:26:57,888
Well, put the boot back on
and lace it up...

912
01:26:58,095 --> 01:26:59,050
...tight.

913
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:00,927
Don't get mad, I didn't break it.

914
01:27:01,135 --> 01:27:02,853
And you're not walking on it.

915
01:27:03,055 --> 01:27:07,207
- You're not going to try...
- Knock it off and do as you're told.

916
01:27:12,655 --> 01:27:13,974


917
01:27:18,015 --> 01:27:19,004
Yes?

918
01:27:19,215 --> 01:27:22,287
A, B and C Company are scattered
all over like we are.

919
01:27:22,495 --> 01:27:23,769
Go on.

920
01:27:23,975 --> 01:27:27,934
Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke
his shoulder. I left him with a medic.

921
01:27:28,135 --> 01:27:29,693
Any contact with F Company?

922
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:33,410
No, but they must be up ahead
in the direction of Sainte-Mre-Eglise.

923
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:34,570
Ow!

924
01:27:34,775 --> 01:27:38,131
Well, go ahead. Tie it off.
Tie it off.

925
01:27:38,335 --> 01:27:40,371


926
01:27:42,335 --> 01:27:43,893
Well, here's where we are.

927
01:27:44,095 --> 01:27:45,926
The northern edge of the swamp area...

928
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:47,932
...five miles from our drop zone.

929
01:27:48,135 --> 01:27:49,887
Five miles.

930
01:27:50,655 --> 01:27:51,690
- F Company?
- No, sir.

931
01:27:51,895 --> 01:27:53,965
And we've got scouts
all over the place.

932
01:27:54,175 --> 01:27:56,131
We even picked up a group
from the 101.

933
01:27:56,335 --> 01:28:00,123
F Company were the first
of the lead planes.

934
01:28:01,135 --> 01:28:02,853
Well, give me a hand.

935
01:28:11,935 --> 01:28:13,607
Can I have my rifle?

936
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:25,530
Well, we'll head out this way.

937
01:28:25,935 --> 01:28:30,372
We ought to reach high ground
and open country by daybreak.

938
01:28:30,855 --> 01:28:33,005
All right. Have the men spread out...

939
01:28:33,215 --> 01:28:35,092
...pick up any stragglers
they can find.

940
01:28:35,295 --> 01:28:36,648
- Pass the word.
- Right, sir.

941
01:28:36,855 --> 01:28:39,688
All right, men, spread out.
Pick up stragglers you see.

942
01:28:39,895 --> 01:28:41,487
Pass the word down.

943
01:28:43,135 --> 01:28:44,454
All right...

944
01:28:44,775 --> 01:28:45,969
...let's go.

945
01:28:47,615 --> 01:28:51,005
From the latest reports,
this is how I see it:

946
01:28:51,215 --> 01:28:54,173
American paratroopers have landed...

947
01:28:55,575 --> 01:28:56,894
Here.

948
01:28:57,775 --> 01:28:59,333
British paratroopers...

949
01:28:59,535 --> 01:29:00,490
Here.

950
01:29:01,535 --> 01:29:03,127
The invasion...

951
01:29:04,535 --> 01:29:05,684
Here.

952
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,127
Yes. Thank you, Pemsel.

953
01:29:12,935 --> 01:29:16,484
General Pemsel is convinced
that this is the invasion!

954
01:29:16,735 --> 01:29:21,411
I do not agree with him.
This is my conclusion:

955
01:29:21,655 --> 01:29:24,886
Normandy is the objective
of a diversionary attack.

956
01:29:25,095 --> 01:29:27,290
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.

957
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:31,374
It's not the main attack. That will
come at the Pas-de-Calais...

958
01:29:32,135 --> 01:29:33,853
...where it was always expected.

959
01:29:37,335 --> 01:29:39,087
Where we always expected it!

960
01:29:39,815 --> 01:29:42,204
But we can't take any chances.

961
01:29:42,415 --> 01:29:45,487
I want the reserve panzers
moved up at once!

962
01:29:45,735 --> 01:29:48,533
We need approval from the
Fhrer's headquarters.

963
01:29:48,775 --> 01:29:51,448
They wouldn't dare refuse me!

964
01:29:51,735 --> 01:29:56,570
Call the Fhrer's headquarters
and insist.

965
01:29:56,775 --> 01:30:01,087
Insist that the panzers be
released to me immediately!

966
01:30:05,735 --> 01:30:11,207
An invasion of Normandy would
be against all military logic.

967
01:30:12,335 --> 01:30:15,168
It would really be against all logic...

968
01:30:25,935 --> 01:30:27,812
Well, that about covers it, gentlemen.

969
01:30:31,415 --> 01:30:33,849
Most of you have had
your feet wet before:

970
01:30:34,335 --> 01:30:36,803
Dunkirk, Dieppe, Norway.

971
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:39,768
And we know what it means
to be driven into the sea.

972
01:30:40,855 --> 01:30:42,811
In a few hours
we're going back from the sea.

973
01:30:44,415 --> 01:30:46,485
And this time we're going to stay.

974
01:30:47,855 --> 01:30:49,811
There's no time
for any sob stuff about...

975
01:30:50,015 --> 01:30:52,210
...England, home and beauty.

976
01:30:53,775 --> 01:30:57,370
Remember, our people have had a
rough time for four and a half years.

977
01:30:58,655 --> 01:31:00,725
They've earned the final victory.

978
01:31:02,855 --> 01:31:04,413
Let's give it to them.

979
01:31:05,615 --> 01:31:08,493
And to our French comrades in arms,
I say:

980
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:10,248
Good luck.

981
01:31:10,455 --> 01:31:12,366
Tomorrow morning, we'll take them.

982
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:17,808


983
01:31:20,255 --> 01:31:21,210
Oh.

984
01:31:21,415 --> 01:31:22,848
Come in, Teddy.

985
01:31:32,775 --> 01:31:34,493
Did you have to put it in writing?

986
01:31:34,735 --> 01:31:37,044
I knew you wouldn't let me go
unless I did.

987
01:31:37,255 --> 01:31:39,211
You're putting me on the spot.

988
01:31:39,415 --> 01:31:41,929
- I didn't mean to, Tubby.
- The hell you didn't.

989
01:31:42,135 --> 01:31:44,808
You put that request in writing,
made it official.

990
01:31:45,015 --> 01:31:47,483
You're the assistant division
commander.

991
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:50,852
And that's why I'm supposed to go
ashore in the first wave.

992
01:31:51,055 --> 01:31:53,728
That's where I'm supposed to be.
You know that.

993
01:31:53,935 --> 01:31:55,527
You're important
to this operation.

994
01:31:55,735 --> 01:31:58,295
We can't have you knocked off
on the first day.

995
01:31:58,495 --> 01:32:00,725
But that's not the real reason.

996
01:32:00,935 --> 01:32:04,405
Isn't it because my father was
president of the United States?

997
01:32:04,655 --> 01:32:06,008
And a great president.

998
01:32:06,215 --> 01:32:07,933
And a great soldier.

999
01:32:08,135 --> 01:32:11,252
He led the charge of the Rough Riders
up San Juan Hill.

1000
01:32:12,255 --> 01:32:15,691
So now you've got to be
the first man ashore on Utah Beach.

1001
01:32:15,895 --> 01:32:19,490
But that's where I'm supposed to be,
Tubby. That's my job.

1002
01:32:25,335 --> 01:32:29,214
Also, I've been there side by side
with the men all through training.

1003
01:32:29,415 --> 01:32:33,374
They're used to seeing where I belong.
They have a right to expect me there.

1004
01:32:33,975 --> 01:32:36,091
President's son or not.

1005
01:32:38,655 --> 01:32:40,407
Is my request denied?

1006
01:32:52,295 --> 01:32:54,092
No, you know it's not.

1007
01:32:55,775 --> 01:32:58,926
Request reluctantly approved.

1008
01:33:00,935 --> 01:33:02,414
Thanks, Tubby.

1009
01:33:04,055 --> 01:33:05,283
Thanks a lot.

1010
01:33:06,735 --> 01:33:07,770
Say...

1011
01:33:07,975 --> 01:33:09,966
...how's that arthritis of yours?

1012
01:33:10,495 --> 01:33:12,087
Arthritis?

1013
01:33:12,735 --> 01:33:15,124
Haven't had a touch in months.

1014
01:33:15,335 --> 01:33:16,609
Glad to hear it.

1015
01:33:34,815 --> 01:33:35,964
The street...

1016
01:33:37,175 --> 01:33:38,449
...the bridge...

1017
01:33:39,295 --> 01:33:40,648
...the hotel...

1018
01:33:42,495 --> 01:33:43,928
...the casino.

1019
01:33:57,775 --> 01:33:59,094
One more thing...

1020
01:34:00,895 --> 01:34:03,773
You have been fighting
everywhere for four years...

1021
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:09,123
...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete...

1022
01:34:11,095 --> 01:34:14,053
But this time you are going
to fight on French soil...

1023
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:16,128
...in our fields...

1024
01:34:17,175 --> 01:34:18,608
...in our villages...

1025
01:34:20,615 --> 01:34:22,367
...under the eyes of our own people.

1026
01:34:31,455 --> 01:34:35,767
The Fhrer took a sedative, I won't
wake him for these reports.

1027
01:34:36,015 --> 01:34:40,725
First we hear that the paratroopers
are shot down plane crews.

1028
01:34:40,935 --> 01:34:43,927
Next they are identified
as mechanical dummies.

1029
01:34:44,135 --> 01:34:47,844
If paratroopers have landed...

1030
01:34:48,055 --> 01:34:51,604
...it can only be a commando raid.

1031
01:34:51,815 --> 01:34:56,206
Is that a sufficient reason to send
the panzers to the coast?

1032
01:34:56,535 --> 01:35:01,450
I will submit all reports to the
Fhrer as soon as he awakens.

1033
01:35:02,415 --> 01:35:04,087
I understand.

1034
01:35:06,015 --> 01:35:07,767
Jodl has turned us down.

1035
01:35:10,255 --> 01:35:14,771
He will not release the panzers
without the Fhrer's approval...

1036
01:35:17,215 --> 01:35:20,048
...and the Fhrer is still asleep!

1037
01:35:21,535 --> 01:35:23,651
Will you tell von Rundstedt?

1038
01:35:26,895 --> 01:35:28,408
No, not now...

1039
01:35:30,695 --> 01:35:32,413
Not now.

1040
01:35:33,855 --> 01:35:35,527
Thank you, gentlemen.

1041
01:35:51,295 --> 01:35:53,604
Sit down.

1042
01:35:55,535 --> 01:35:57,685
This is history!

1043
01:35:59,455 --> 01:36:02,970
We are living an historical moment.

1044
01:36:04,415 --> 01:36:05,689
We are going to lose the war...

1045
01:36:06,055 --> 01:36:10,685
...because the glorious Fhrer
has taken a sleeping pill...

1046
01:36:12,295 --> 01:36:14,604
...and is not to be awakened.

1047
01:36:15,655 --> 01:36:17,646
It's unbelievable.

1048
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:19,413
Think of it, Kurt.

1049
01:36:21,055 --> 01:36:23,125
Don't ever forget it.

1050
01:36:24,255 --> 01:36:27,088
We are witnessing something...

1051
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:31,288
...which historians will always
say is completely improbable...

1052
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:33,133
...and yet it is true.

1053
01:36:36,535 --> 01:36:39,413
The Fhrer is not to be awakened!

1054
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:44,414
I sometimes wonder
whose side God is on.

1055
01:36:45,695 --> 01:36:46,844
Can I...

1056
01:36:48,095 --> 01:36:50,086
...bring you anything, sir?

1057
01:36:53,775 --> 01:36:57,211
In my room there is a bottle
of excellent cognac...

1058
01:36:57,415 --> 01:36:59,929
...Napoleon, unopened.

1059
01:37:00,775 --> 01:37:03,767
I was even saving it for
a fitting occasion.

1060
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:09,365
This isn't exactly the right
occasion, but get it anyway.

1061
01:37:33,893 --> 01:37:35,531
Daylight at last.

1062
01:37:37,973 --> 01:37:40,692
A whole night wasted again!

1063
01:37:43,493 --> 01:37:45,211


1064
01:37:48,293 --> 01:37:49,248
Where's my dog?

1065
01:37:49,453 --> 01:37:51,444
He was here a minute ago.

1066
01:37:56,973 --> 01:37:58,691
Let's have one last look.

1067
01:38:04,533 --> 01:38:06,125
Not even a seagull...

1068
01:38:15,493 --> 01:38:16,721
My God!

1069
01:38:23,133 --> 01:38:24,532
The invasion.

1070
01:38:25,973 --> 01:38:27,292
They're coming!

1071
01:38:31,213 --> 01:38:35,809
It's the invasion! There must be
five thousand ships out there!

1072
01:38:36,373 --> 01:38:38,762
Get hold of yourself, Pluskat.

1073
01:38:40,533 --> 01:38:43,764
The enemy doesn't have
even half that many.

1074
01:38:44,133 --> 01:38:48,012
Well dammit! Come and see
for yourself, you fool!

1075
01:38:48,973 --> 01:38:50,531
It's amazing.

1076
01:38:50,773 --> 01:38:53,082
It's beyond belief.

1077
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:57,882
My dear Pluskat, where are
these ships heading?

1078
01:38:58,093 --> 01:38:59,685
Straight for me!

1079
01:39:14,973 --> 01:39:17,567
General, in exactly two minutes...

1080
01:39:17,773 --> 01:39:19,889
...the fleet will open fire.

1081
01:39:20,653 --> 01:39:24,248
Your attention, please.
The Admiral has an announcement.

1082
01:39:28,693 --> 01:39:31,287
Soon we shall be engaged in battle.

1083
01:39:32,253 --> 01:39:37,008
To drive the enemy out, we must
fire on our homeland.

1084
01:39:37,813 --> 01:39:39,929
This is the price of liberty.

1085
01:39:41,013 --> 01:39:42,287
Long live France!

1086
01:40:09,893 --> 01:40:13,363
There he goes, right on time... as usual.

1087
01:40:51,653 --> 01:40:53,928


1088
01:41:02,093 --> 01:41:06,132
They're landing!
They're coming! They're coming!

1089
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:16,403
I'm not crazy.
Look, they're landing!

1090
01:41:16,653 --> 01:41:18,883
The Americans, the English
and the French!

1091
01:41:53,253 --> 01:41:57,565
Do you hear me? What's the matter
with you? What's going on?

1092
01:41:57,893 --> 01:42:00,453
You must be deaf! Can't you...?

1093
01:42:01,533 --> 01:42:04,969
Dammit can't you hear
it for yourself?

1094
01:42:08,293 --> 01:42:12,286
We're under fire. Yes, under fire!

1095
01:42:17,413 --> 01:42:21,884
Those five thousand ships you
say the Allies haven't got...

1096
01:42:22,213 --> 01:42:25,091
...well, they've got them!

1097
01:42:36,173 --> 01:42:37,811
It's wonderful!

1098
01:42:47,813 --> 01:42:49,610


1099
01:42:56,453 --> 01:42:58,364
Yes? What is it now?

1100
01:42:58,573 --> 01:43:00,006
Listen to me, Pips.

1101
01:43:00,213 --> 01:43:04,445
The invasion has started!
Put yourself on alert at once!

1102
01:43:04,693 --> 01:43:08,288
What the hell can I do
with only two planes?

1103
01:43:08,573 --> 01:43:10,882
Where are the others, you idiots?!

1104
01:43:11,293 --> 01:43:15,650
Priller, that's an order! Get
ready at once! Understand?

1105
01:43:15,853 --> 01:43:18,651
If it isn't too much trouble...

1106
01:43:18,853 --> 01:43:23,005
...would you tell me where
the invasion is?

1107
01:43:24,133 --> 01:43:27,011
Normandy! How delightful!

1108
01:43:27,213 --> 01:43:31,411
Thanks my faithful Hans.
That's the end for us! So long!

1109
01:43:32,053 --> 01:43:35,489
It's getting very difficult to
get any sleep around here.

1110
01:43:38,093 --> 01:43:43,167
Your prospects for a long sleep are
excellent. The invasion has begun.

1111
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:47,449
We're flying there, the two of us.

1112
01:43:48,573 --> 01:43:50,245
Nobody else is left.

1113
01:43:52,133 --> 01:43:53,885
I don't think we're coming back.

1114
01:44:48,853 --> 01:44:51,845


1115
01:45:03,133 --> 01:45:04,805
The shelling has stopped.

1116
01:45:08,493 --> 01:45:09,528
Landing craft approaching.

1117
01:45:09,773 --> 01:45:13,971
Return to headquarters. Direct
your troops from there!

1118
01:45:14,373 --> 01:45:16,443
Landing craft approaching the coast!

1119
01:45:21,453 --> 01:45:23,728
Those French bastards!

1120
01:45:23,933 --> 01:45:25,764
Sergeant!

1121
01:45:25,973 --> 01:45:29,124
Send this to headquarters by courier.

1122
01:45:30,693 --> 01:45:34,766
No! Take it yourself. Tell
them our lines are cut!

1123
01:45:34,973 --> 01:45:36,850
Gentlemen, come here please.

1124
01:46:15,813 --> 01:46:19,442
There it is, men.
Omaha Beach, dead ahead.

1125
01:46:20,373 --> 01:46:21,567
Lock on the target!

1126
01:46:24,333 --> 01:46:26,005
Stand by!

1127
01:46:28,773 --> 01:46:30,206
Fire!

1128
01:47:28,373 --> 01:47:30,523
Get off of the beach!

1129
01:47:30,773 --> 01:47:32,491
Let's go!

1130
01:48:15,413 --> 01:48:16,528
Come on, move up!

1131
01:48:34,733 --> 01:48:35,722
Hello, General, sir.

1132
01:48:35,933 --> 01:48:37,730
Are you all right, boy?

1133
01:48:37,933 --> 01:48:38,843
Yes, sir.

1134
01:48:39,053 --> 01:48:42,045
Don't you think you better go
back and get your rifle?

1135
01:48:42,773 --> 01:48:43,523
Out there, sir?

1136
01:48:43,733 --> 01:48:46,531
You're almost sure to need it
before this day is over.

1137
01:48:47,893 --> 01:48:48,769
Yes, sir.

1138
01:49:02,373 --> 01:49:03,806


1139
01:49:04,013 --> 01:49:06,732
Come on! Move on up! Let's go.

1140
01:49:13,773 --> 01:49:14,888
Medic!

1141
01:49:15,093 --> 01:49:16,003
Medic!

1142
01:49:36,013 --> 01:49:38,766
General, first reports
from Omaha, sir.

1143
01:49:38,973 --> 01:49:40,247
"Assault teams have landed.

1144
01:49:40,453 --> 01:49:43,172
No direct radio contact,
but destroyers report...

1145
01:49:43,373 --> 01:49:46,365
...first and second waves
appear pinned down on the beach.

1146
01:49:46,573 --> 01:49:49,371
Concentrated artillery
and mortar fire.

1147
01:49:49,573 --> 01:49:53,168
Third wave floundering. "
Heavy casualties, sir.

1148
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:18,052


1149
01:50:49,813 --> 01:50:51,849
When the mortars and machine guns
are silenced...

1150
01:50:52,053 --> 01:50:54,123
...have the battalion commanders
join me...

1151
01:50:54,813 --> 01:50:55,563
...over there.

1152
01:50:55,813 --> 01:50:56,928
Okay.

1153
01:50:57,133 --> 01:50:59,408
Hang on to that map case, Eddie.

1154
01:51:28,293 --> 01:51:29,567
I made it.

1155
01:51:32,013 --> 01:51:33,241
Hey, I made it.

1156
01:51:33,573 --> 01:51:35,404
Did you see me get those two guys?

1157
01:51:37,053 --> 01:51:38,452
Hey, Sergeant?

1158
01:51:42,373 --> 01:51:43,692
Sergeant?

1159
01:51:45,773 --> 01:51:49,322
As best as I can figure it,
this is the wrong beach.

1160
01:51:49,533 --> 01:51:53,128
We're a mile and a quarter south
of where we were supposed to land.

1161
01:51:53,333 --> 01:51:54,971
We should be up there.

1162
01:51:55,253 --> 01:51:58,211
Control boat must've been confused
by the naval bombardment smoke.

1163
01:51:58,653 --> 01:52:00,769
I agree with you,
but what will we do now?

1164
01:52:00,973 --> 01:52:03,965
Our reinforcements and heavy equipment
will approach in a very few minutes.

1165
01:52:04,173 --> 01:52:07,245
- I know, I know.
- What if they land at the right beach?

1166
01:52:16,293 --> 01:52:19,524
The reinforcements will have to
follow us wherever we are.

1167
01:52:21,173 --> 01:52:22,970
We're starting the war from right here.

1168
01:52:24,053 --> 01:52:26,965
- Head inland. We're going inland.
- Okay, let's go.

1169
01:52:44,253 --> 01:52:46,687
Follow me. Do everything I do!

1170
01:52:50,253 --> 01:52:52,562
All right. Let's go!

1171
01:53:07,413 --> 01:53:09,210


1172
01:53:36,733 --> 01:53:38,963
Head for home!

1173
01:53:40,493 --> 01:53:43,724
The Luftwaffe has had its great moment!

1174
01:53:53,533 --> 01:53:54,852
Stand by to beach.

1175
01:53:55,053 --> 01:53:57,009
Duncan, take care of that strongpoint.

1176
01:53:57,573 --> 01:54:00,451
Any minute now. Stand by!

1177
01:54:00,693 --> 01:54:02,763
Let's give it them back for Dunkirk!

1178
01:54:03,253 --> 01:54:05,847
You hear that? Dunkirk.
Do you hear it, Clough?

1179
01:54:06,053 --> 01:54:08,009
Sure he was at school at the time.

1180
01:54:10,373 --> 01:54:12,364
Come on, you bums!

1181
01:54:13,133 --> 01:54:16,921
Come out, you dirty slobs!
Flannagan's back!

1182
01:54:20,013 --> 01:54:23,130
The evil of it all. Drowning a man
before he fights.

1183
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:24,243
Oh, come on!

1184
01:54:58,453 --> 01:55:00,842
Keep those vehicles moving!

1185
01:55:01,053 --> 01:55:04,443
MP, chase out those cyclists.

1186
01:55:07,053 --> 01:55:09,283
Get off the beach! Move inland!

1187
01:55:11,013 --> 01:55:12,332
Come on, you lot!

1188
01:55:12,533 --> 01:55:13,932
Hurry it up.

1189
01:55:17,253 --> 01:55:18,891
Never mind the blathering!

1190
01:55:19,093 --> 01:55:20,970
We must put these down somewhere.

1191
01:55:21,173 --> 01:55:22,925
The sooner you get off the beach...

1192
01:55:23,133 --> 01:55:25,852
...the sooner they'll stop
this blasted shelling.

1193
01:55:26,053 --> 01:55:28,009
It's very bad for the dog!

1194
01:55:30,733 --> 01:55:32,485
Down, Winston, down!

1195
01:55:33,493 --> 01:55:36,007
Beach Master Sword, Section 2-A.

1196
01:55:36,213 --> 01:55:39,364
Third wave ashore on time.
No obstruction to follow-up.

1197
01:55:39,573 --> 01:55:41,086
Standing by.

1198
01:55:42,453 --> 01:55:43,932
Get going!

1199
01:55:44,293 --> 01:55:46,853
For heaven's sake,
get that carrier off the beach!

1200
01:55:47,053 --> 01:55:50,090
I was told I could transmit
a newsflash on your radio.

1201
01:55:50,293 --> 01:55:52,648
If you can't drive it, carry it!

1202
01:55:53,453 --> 01:55:54,408
You were saying?

1203
01:55:54,613 --> 01:55:57,173
I was told I could transmit
a newsflash on your...

1204
01:55:57,373 --> 01:56:00,649
My dear fellow, I don't want
to appear uncooperative...

1205
01:56:00,893 --> 01:56:03,361
Yes, I know all about
the power of the press.

1206
01:56:03,573 --> 01:56:07,043
But this line happens
to be rather busy! Come on!

1207
01:56:10,973 --> 01:56:12,645
Down, Winston. Down, Winston.

1208
01:56:15,493 --> 01:56:16,642
What did he say?

1209
01:56:16,893 --> 01:56:18,485
The answer is no.

1210
01:56:18,733 --> 01:56:20,451
We have to use the damn pigeons.

1211
01:56:20,653 --> 01:56:22,291
I've got these ready.

1212
01:56:22,813 --> 01:56:24,371
Here, clip this on.

1213
01:56:38,453 --> 01:56:39,932
They're going the wrong way.

1214
01:56:40,133 --> 01:56:42,044
Not toward the Germans, you idiots!

1215
01:56:42,253 --> 01:56:45,245
The other way! The other way!

1216
01:56:45,453 --> 01:56:47,091
Damned traitors!

1217
01:56:47,293 --> 01:56:49,887
- Hold it.
- Can't you get your finger out?

1218
01:56:50,093 --> 01:56:51,003
What's the matter?

1219
01:56:51,213 --> 01:56:54,444
Engine won't start, sir.
Full of seawater, I think.

1220
01:56:55,853 --> 01:56:57,366
My old grandmother used to say...

1221
01:56:57,573 --> 01:57:00,167
...anything mechanical,
give it a good bash.

1222
01:57:00,733 --> 01:57:01,643
Try it now.

1223
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:04,764


1224
01:57:04,973 --> 01:57:05,962
Thank you, sir.

1225
01:57:06,173 --> 01:57:07,606
Off you go. Good luck.

1226
01:57:12,333 --> 01:57:13,652
I'm sure that got it out.

1227
01:57:15,533 --> 01:57:17,603
That's what I call a hell of a man!

1228
01:57:17,813 --> 01:57:19,929
Aye, I like his dog too.

1229
01:57:20,933 --> 01:57:22,651
Don't stand there yapping!

1230
01:57:22,853 --> 01:57:25,492
This isn't Hyde Park Corner!
The war's over there!

1231
01:57:27,973 --> 01:57:28,962
Come along!

1232
01:57:29,173 --> 01:57:30,367
Come on!

1233
01:57:31,093 --> 01:57:34,005
Thank you.
- Everything's going according to plan.

1234
01:57:34,213 --> 01:57:37,364
Stand by to move.
Millin, "Blue Bonnet. "

1235
01:57:41,573 --> 01:57:44,087


1236
01:57:44,653 --> 01:57:46,132


1237
01:57:48,093 --> 01:57:50,209
What in God's name...?

1238
01:57:54,213 --> 01:57:57,842
Oh, my friends. What a day!
What a day!

1239
01:57:58,133 --> 01:58:00,328
Welcome to France.
Welcome to Colleville!

1240
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:02,603
Most kind of you.
Very nice to meet you...

1241
01:58:02,853 --> 01:58:04,889
Look at this. I kept it for you all.

1242
01:58:05,093 --> 01:58:07,812
But I don't think there
will be enough for everyone.

1243
01:58:08,013 --> 01:58:11,926
Perhaps next time. We have
a previous engagement: the war!

1244
01:58:12,893 --> 01:58:14,485
Mustn't lose that champagne!

1245
01:58:14,733 --> 01:58:17,725
All right, men, fall in!
Millin, "Blue Bonnet. "

1246
01:58:19,293 --> 01:58:20,567
Goodbye.

1247
01:58:22,133 --> 01:58:24,886
Thank you, boys! Thank you!

1248
01:58:25,133 --> 01:58:27,249


1249
01:58:30,413 --> 01:58:33,052
Long live France!
Long live the Allies!

1250
01:58:34,213 --> 01:58:35,441
If you ask me, Flanagan...

1251
01:58:35,653 --> 01:58:38,963
...there's a lot of very
peculiar blokes on this beach.

1252
01:58:40,293 --> 01:58:41,772
Welcome!

1253
01:58:42,613 --> 01:58:44,285
Welcome to you all!

1254
02:00:31,293 --> 02:00:34,410
Thank you, dear, they're lovely!

1255
02:00:36,413 --> 02:00:38,324
Better try them on first.

1256
02:00:38,533 --> 02:00:40,683


1257
02:00:43,293 --> 02:00:44,692
Rommel speaking.

1258
02:00:44,893 --> 02:00:46,292
Good morning.

1259
02:00:47,173 --> 02:00:48,492
What?

1260
02:00:49,093 --> 02:00:50,412
What!

1261
02:00:51,053 --> 02:00:52,372
Where?

1262
02:00:52,813 --> 02:00:53,802
Normandy!

1263
02:00:54,813 --> 02:00:56,963
Have they a foothold already?

1264
02:00:57,413 --> 02:00:59,973
They must be thrown back!

1265
02:01:00,533 --> 02:01:02,569
What about the panzer reserves?

1266
02:01:03,613 --> 02:01:06,844
Did von Rundstedt obtain
their release from the Fhrer?

1267
02:01:17,853 --> 02:01:19,252
Normandy!

1268
02:01:23,253 --> 02:01:24,845
How stupid of me!

1269
02:01:40,253 --> 02:01:41,606
There it is.

1270
02:01:52,533 --> 02:01:55,093
You mean to tell me
that's all we gotta climb?

1271
02:01:55,293 --> 02:01:57,443
They're not as high
as the practice ones.

1272
02:01:57,653 --> 02:01:59,371
They wasn't shooting at us then.

1273
02:02:00,893 --> 02:02:03,202
Why can't the Air Force
or Navy do this job?

1274
02:02:03,413 --> 02:02:07,042
The big guns in bunkers behind the
cliff can't be seen from the air.

1275
02:02:07,253 --> 02:02:10,370
We knock them out or they'll
murder our guys on the beach.

1276
02:02:10,573 --> 02:02:12,245
Yeah, well if you ask me...

1277
02:02:12,453 --> 02:02:15,286
...three grandmothers with brooms
could sweep us off there...

1278
02:02:15,493 --> 02:02:17,370
...like flies off of a sugar cake.

1279
02:08:36,533 --> 02:08:38,330
That's it, the one we're after.

1280
02:09:32,933 --> 02:09:34,286
It's empty.

1281
02:09:34,733 --> 02:09:38,009
The Air Force and Navy
really plastered this baby.

1282
02:09:38,213 --> 02:09:39,566
But I don't get...

1283
02:09:40,453 --> 02:09:41,772
The guns.

1284
02:09:42,453 --> 02:09:43,966
There ain't no mounts.

1285
02:09:44,773 --> 02:09:46,843
They've never even been installed.

1286
02:09:48,173 --> 02:09:49,322
You mean...

1287
02:09:50,173 --> 02:09:53,006
...we come up all this way...

1288
02:09:53,213 --> 02:09:54,726
...for nothing?

1289
02:09:59,573 --> 02:10:01,643
Don't worry, sarge,
you'll be all right.

1290
02:10:01,853 --> 02:10:04,048
Medic! Medic!

1291
02:10:05,173 --> 02:10:07,050


1292
02:10:12,653 --> 02:10:14,962
I wonder what "bitte, bitte" means?

1293
02:10:25,013 --> 02:10:28,608
What the hell are you
wearing a life preserver for?

1294
02:10:29,173 --> 02:10:30,891
I can't swim.

1295
02:10:38,653 --> 02:10:43,010
Normandy. It really is Normandy.

1296
02:10:43,773 --> 02:10:47,561
This is madness... madness...
sheer madness!

1297
02:10:50,973 --> 02:10:55,046
I just talked to General Jodl...
the Fhrer is awake.

1298
02:10:55,253 --> 02:11:00,611
I don't care if he's awake or not!
What about the reserve panzers?

1299
02:11:01,413 --> 02:11:05,725
The Fhrer went into
one of his tantrums...

1300
02:11:06,293 --> 02:11:08,966
...and no one dared
bring up the subject.

1301
02:11:09,493 --> 02:11:11,563
They're still held in reserve!

1302
02:11:12,173 --> 02:11:14,209
Yes, Field Marshal.

1303
02:11:17,613 --> 02:11:19,968
Sir, if you would call
the Fhrer yourself...

1304
02:11:20,373 --> 02:11:23,570
...I am convinced he would
respect your views.

1305
02:11:23,853 --> 02:11:25,332
Call him?

1306
02:11:25,533 --> 02:11:28,286
Call that Bohemian corporal?!

1307
02:11:29,173 --> 02:11:32,404
Crawl on my knees to him?!

1308
02:11:33,013 --> 02:11:35,573
No! It is out of the question!

1309
02:11:38,933 --> 02:11:44,326
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

1310
02:11:44,733 --> 02:11:45,768
What's that?

1311
02:11:46,013 --> 02:11:49,164
Nothing... nothing of importance.

1312
02:11:50,973 --> 02:11:52,611
Here, let me help you.

1313
02:11:53,773 --> 02:11:56,810
You all right, Tom?
Come on, they're up there.

1314
02:11:57,733 --> 02:11:59,485


1315
02:12:00,933 --> 02:12:02,764
- Sir.
- Well?

1316
02:12:03,053 --> 02:12:06,250
Mr. Smith says to tell you
he's stood his men too.

1317
02:12:06,453 --> 02:12:08,523
The Jerries are moving up
into the woods...

1318
02:12:08,773 --> 02:12:10,604
...with machine guns and mortars.

1319
02:12:11,453 --> 02:12:14,365
Tell the men to stand firm!
- Tell the chaps...

1320
02:12:14,573 --> 02:12:17,531
Tell them to expect another
counterattack, a heavy one.

1321
02:12:21,773 --> 02:12:23,729
- Here you are, mate.
- Ta.

1322
02:12:24,893 --> 02:12:27,168


1323
02:12:27,573 --> 02:12:28,528
What's the matter?

1324
02:12:28,733 --> 02:12:31,201
Listen. I thought I heard bagpipes.

1325
02:12:31,413 --> 02:12:33,165
Don't be daft!

1326
02:12:41,533 --> 02:12:44,570
I told you I heard bagpipes!
It's the reinforcements.

1327
02:12:58,133 --> 02:12:59,168
It's Lovat!

1328
02:13:06,813 --> 02:13:08,087
Come on!

1329
02:13:08,613 --> 02:13:10,046
Come on!

1330
02:13:35,933 --> 02:13:37,969
- Sorry I'm late.
- Better than never, sir.

1331
02:13:38,173 --> 02:13:39,526
Glad to see you, Shimmy.

1332
02:13:44,053 --> 02:13:47,090
You boys are right on target.
What's the situation?

1333
02:13:47,293 --> 02:13:50,126
Jerry's regrouping in the woods,
about a mile.

1334
02:13:50,453 --> 02:13:52,171
With mortars and machine guns.

1335
02:13:52,373 --> 02:13:53,283
Numbers?

1336
02:13:53,493 --> 02:13:57,168
No idea, Shimmy, but they seem
to be moving forward in force.

1337
02:13:58,973 --> 02:14:00,531
In that case, we won't wait.

1338
02:14:01,293 --> 02:14:02,646
We'd better get moving.

1339
02:14:03,293 --> 02:14:05,124
All right, we're going across.

1340
02:14:05,333 --> 02:14:06,482
- Millin!
- Sir?

1341
02:14:07,293 --> 02:14:08,851
"Black Bear," sir.

1342
02:14:09,293 --> 02:14:11,443
All right, come on.

1343
02:14:11,653 --> 02:14:13,052
Everybody up!

1344
02:14:13,533 --> 02:14:14,932
On your feet!

1345
02:14:21,053 --> 02:14:24,045
There he goes. He's at it again.

1346
02:14:24,413 --> 02:14:27,052
Ever hear such a bleeding racket
in all your life?

1347
02:14:27,253 --> 02:14:29,892
Yeah, it takes an Irishman
to play the pipes.

1348
02:14:44,853 --> 02:14:46,923
Hold until relieved.

1349
02:14:47,133 --> 02:14:48,805
Hold until relieved.

1350
02:14:51,133 --> 02:14:55,763
North by east, north by east.
Sainte-Mre-Eglise is that way.

1351
02:14:56,213 --> 02:14:58,044
Somebody turned that sign around.

1352
02:14:58,253 --> 02:15:01,802
Doesn't anybody in this outfit
look at a compass besides me?

1353
02:15:02,213 --> 02:15:03,487
Hey, you guys!

1354
02:15:03,733 --> 02:15:07,248
Over here! Over here!

1355
02:15:08,373 --> 02:15:10,329
Over here, on the double.

1356
02:15:12,893 --> 02:15:15,123
- Where you taking that?
- We don't know, sir.

1357
02:15:15,333 --> 02:15:17,130
We took the wrong road.

1358
02:15:17,973 --> 02:15:19,645
What do you got in here, ammo?

1359
02:15:19,893 --> 02:15:21,121
Yes, sir.

1360
02:15:21,493 --> 02:15:22,403
You 82nd?

1361
02:15:22,613 --> 02:15:24,092
No, sir, 101.

1362
02:15:24,293 --> 02:15:26,853
Well, you're in the 82nd now.

1363
02:15:27,933 --> 02:15:29,969
- But, sir, we're...
- But what?

1364
02:15:30,173 --> 02:15:31,492
Nothing, sir.

1365
02:15:32,373 --> 02:15:34,125
All right, move out.

1366
02:15:37,653 --> 02:15:39,803
- Knock that sign down!
- Yes, sir.

1367
02:15:45,893 --> 02:15:49,568
- Something's moving up there, colonel.
- Hit the dirt! Take cover.

1368
02:15:52,653 --> 02:15:54,530
Lieutenant Sheen, sir, A Company.

1369
02:15:56,773 --> 02:15:58,968
Colonel, it's me!

1370
02:16:01,333 --> 02:16:03,642
- Where did you come from?
- Sainte-Mre-Eglise.

1371
02:16:03,893 --> 02:16:06,487
We hold the main road
and north side of the square.

1372
02:16:06,733 --> 02:16:09,725
The Germans have a battery
on the other side of the town...

1373
02:16:09,933 --> 02:16:12,367
...and command the countryside.
- And Major Lance?

1374
02:16:12,573 --> 02:16:16,122
- Holed up in a building in the square.
- F Company?

1375
02:16:16,813 --> 02:16:20,328
They overshot the drop zone
and landed in the middle of the town.

1376
02:16:20,533 --> 02:16:21,522
Go on.

1377
02:16:21,773 --> 02:16:24,492
It was a nightmare, sir. A slaughter.

1378
02:16:24,733 --> 02:16:27,247
They were mowed down
before they hit the ground.

1379
02:16:29,093 --> 02:16:30,845


1380
02:16:31,413 --> 02:16:33,973
Major Lance sent me to try
and contact you, sir.

1381
02:16:34,173 --> 02:16:37,609
He wants your permission to pull back
and regroup outside of town.

1382
02:16:40,333 --> 02:16:44,884
No, damn it. We came here
to take Sainte-Mre-Eglise.

1383
02:16:45,093 --> 02:16:46,924
We're gonna take it and hold it.

1384
02:16:48,213 --> 02:16:50,568
Follow the lieutenant, gentlemen.

1385
02:17:01,093 --> 02:17:03,368
- Sir.
- Thank you.

1386
02:17:04,653 --> 02:17:08,362
British and Canadians advancing
steadily from Sword, Gold, and Juno.

1387
02:17:11,573 --> 02:17:13,370
Anything from Omaha?

1388
02:17:13,613 --> 02:17:17,652
Nothing since the first message:
heavy fighting, heavy casualties.

1389
02:17:17,853 --> 02:17:19,002
Sir.

1390
02:17:22,213 --> 02:17:23,407
Omaha?

1391
02:17:25,173 --> 02:17:26,162
No.

1392
02:17:29,653 --> 02:17:33,328
I can't understand why Jerry hasn't
brought his heavy armor into play.

1393
02:17:34,133 --> 02:17:36,647
All the panzer divisions
except the 21 st...

1394
02:17:36,893 --> 02:17:39,327
...seem to be sitting it out
in the rear.

1395
02:17:39,893 --> 02:17:40,882
Sir.

1396
02:17:43,973 --> 02:17:47,522
French commandos driving inland
from Sword...

1397
02:17:47,773 --> 02:17:49,968
...have reached the outskirts
of Ouistreham.

1398
02:17:50,613 --> 02:17:52,092
Ouistreham.

1399
02:18:17,093 --> 02:18:18,890


1400
02:20:35,813 --> 02:20:37,485
Fall back!

1401
02:20:40,173 --> 02:20:41,731
Take cover!

1402
02:20:56,813 --> 02:21:00,726
Tank support!
We must have tank support!

1403
02:21:04,213 --> 02:21:05,851


1404
02:21:19,733 --> 02:21:21,644


1405
02:21:24,973 --> 02:21:26,292
Fire!

1406
02:21:36,133 --> 02:21:37,452
Fire!

1407
02:21:42,133 --> 02:21:44,408


1408
02:21:45,373 --> 02:21:47,011
I can't get them!

1409
02:21:47,333 --> 02:21:49,369
Keep trying! We must have support!

1410
02:21:49,973 --> 02:21:54,171
Hold your positions...
I'm going for a tank!

1411
02:21:55,413 --> 02:21:57,768
Give us as much cover as you can!

1412
02:22:43,893 --> 02:22:45,212
Fire!

1413
02:22:50,053 --> 02:22:51,372
Try for the cannon!

1414
02:22:56,733 --> 02:22:59,088
Get the wounded out of here!

1415
02:23:25,973 --> 02:23:26,962
Go back!

1416
02:23:27,773 --> 02:23:29,092
Get out of here!

1417
02:23:30,733 --> 02:23:32,769
No! No!

1418
02:23:47,373 --> 02:23:49,443
You can't stay here!

1419
02:23:49,653 --> 02:23:52,326
I am Mother Superior of the convent.

1420
02:23:52,533 --> 02:23:54,922
The sisters are qualified nurses.

1421
02:23:55,133 --> 02:24:00,127
But Madame... I mean, Mother,
we're in the middle of a battle!

1422
02:24:03,013 --> 02:24:04,890
Take care of the wounded.

1423
02:24:17,733 --> 02:24:19,132
Fire!

1424
02:24:28,293 --> 02:24:30,249


1425
02:24:38,973 --> 02:24:39,962
It's a tank!

1426
02:24:42,613 --> 02:24:43,966
It's Kieffer!

1427
02:24:53,853 --> 02:24:55,889
In the other direction!

1428
02:25:06,293 --> 02:25:09,569
Clear away the debris! Hurry!

1429
02:25:25,333 --> 02:25:27,130


1430
02:25:45,053 --> 02:25:47,362
But where is the Luftwaffe?!

1431
02:25:47,573 --> 02:25:48,528
I'm trying...

1432
02:25:48,773 --> 02:25:50,604
Yeah, yeah, you're trying.

1433
02:25:58,373 --> 02:26:02,889
The British troops have a beachhead
here. They are moving inland.

1434
02:26:03,093 --> 02:26:08,725
The Americans hold Ste-Mre-Eglise
and have cut the highway.

1435
02:26:08,933 --> 02:26:11,925
We control this center section.

1436
02:26:12,453 --> 02:26:17,573
The Americans have landed but
their attack has bogged down.

1437
02:26:18,213 --> 02:26:20,966
Rommel is right...

1438
02:26:21,213 --> 02:26:24,523
If we can hold them on the beaches...

1439
02:26:24,773 --> 02:26:26,684
...the invasion will collapse.

1440
02:27:02,053 --> 02:27:03,122
That thing still work?

1441
02:27:03,333 --> 02:27:05,403
Yes, sir, now and then.

1442
02:27:05,613 --> 02:27:08,047
- Anything from the other beaches?
- Not directly.

1443
02:27:08,253 --> 02:27:11,643
A while ago the sergeant picked up
some flashes from the destroyers.

1444
02:27:12,493 --> 02:27:16,532
The 4th Division is off Utah Beach
and moving inland.

1445
02:27:16,733 --> 02:27:18,052
Inland?

1446
02:27:20,373 --> 02:27:23,365
- What about the 1 st Division?
- They're hung up, sir.

1447
02:27:23,573 --> 02:27:24,972
Like we are.

1448
02:27:29,213 --> 02:27:30,532
Move out.

1449
02:27:49,013 --> 02:27:51,288
- What do you think?
- Think?

1450
02:27:52,173 --> 02:27:55,324
We must have close to a thousand
casualties up to now.

1451
02:27:55,533 --> 02:27:58,093
Do you want me to have the ships
start picking us up?

1452
02:27:58,853 --> 02:28:01,367
- You think it's that bad?
- I don't see what else to do.

1453
02:28:01,573 --> 02:28:03,404
We can't get up this hill.

1454
02:28:03,613 --> 02:28:06,207
If we don't get off this beach,
we won't have any division left.

1455
02:28:06,413 --> 02:28:07,368
What?

1456
02:28:08,413 --> 02:28:10,131
These are our men, Tom.

1457
02:28:10,333 --> 02:28:14,246
You think we brought them in so some
die and ask the rest to turn tail?

1458
02:28:14,453 --> 02:28:17,126
Hell, no.
We're gonna get up that hill.

1459
02:28:17,333 --> 02:28:19,801
Find me somebody to speak
for the Rangers.

1460
02:28:20,013 --> 02:28:22,652
Back down the beach
on the right there's a gully.

1461
02:28:22,973 --> 02:28:27,728
With a heavily defended roadblock
and machine gun nests on both sides.

1462
02:28:27,933 --> 02:28:30,925
- Lf we can blow our way through...
- We've hit it three times.

1463
02:28:31,133 --> 02:28:33,488
- We didn't get close.
- Three times isn't enough.

1464
02:28:33,733 --> 02:28:36,964
We're gonna hit it again.
Can you find me some engineers?

1465
02:28:37,173 --> 02:28:38,083
They're all around you!

1466
02:28:38,293 --> 02:28:40,523
I mean engineers
with equipment still working.

1467
02:28:42,253 --> 02:28:44,005
Then I shouldn't radio the ships?

1468
02:28:44,213 --> 02:28:45,407
No, damn it!

1469
02:28:45,613 --> 02:28:49,526
We need bangalore torpedoes,
bazookas, mortars, wire cutters...

1470
02:28:49,773 --> 02:28:52,333
...and every man that can stand.
Pass the word, will you?

1471
02:28:54,053 --> 02:28:55,406
Okay, Norm.

1472
02:29:11,333 --> 02:29:13,642
Now listen to me, all of you.

1473
02:29:14,333 --> 02:29:16,528
You guys got to snap out of it.

1474
02:29:16,773 --> 02:29:19,526
We're getting off of here,
and we're going inland.

1475
02:29:19,773 --> 02:29:22,606
What about weapons, General?
My men lost everything.

1476
02:29:22,813 --> 02:29:25,122
They gotta have something
to fight with.

1477
02:29:25,333 --> 02:29:27,085
Strip the dead and the wounded.

1478
02:29:27,293 --> 02:29:29,204
Pick up anything that'll shoot.

1479
02:29:29,413 --> 02:29:32,007
I don't have to tell you the score,
you all know it.

1480
02:29:32,213 --> 02:29:35,046
Only two kinds of people
are gonna stay on this beach:

1481
02:29:35,253 --> 02:29:39,041
Those that are already dead and those
that will die. Get off your butts!

1482
02:29:39,253 --> 02:29:41,847
You guys are the fighting 29th!

1483
02:29:58,653 --> 02:30:00,325
I've looked at the naval reports.

1484
02:30:00,533 --> 02:30:01,602
Yes?

1485
02:30:02,413 --> 02:30:06,372
According to reports from the offshore
destroyers, Omaha is a shambles.

1486
02:30:06,813 --> 02:30:09,452
There's no evidence...
To quote the report exactly:

1487
02:30:09,653 --> 02:30:13,805
"There is no evidence of any movement
that can be observed off the beach. "

1488
02:30:15,733 --> 02:30:17,405
I'd better have a look through these.

1489
02:30:20,853 --> 02:30:22,252
How is Ike taking it?

1490
02:30:22,453 --> 02:30:26,082
Like everybody else, sir.
Hanging on by his fingernails.

1491
02:30:28,373 --> 02:30:31,968
No, no! We must regroup
according to Plan Six!

1492
02:30:33,453 --> 02:30:34,772
Hello?

1493
02:30:36,213 --> 02:30:38,363
Hello? Hello?

1494
02:30:38,573 --> 02:30:39,801
Can you hear me?

1495
02:30:40,013 --> 02:30:43,369
I said we must regroup
according to Plan Six.

1496
02:30:44,333 --> 02:30:46,085
Nonsense!

1497
02:30:46,293 --> 02:30:49,444
If the panzers arrive, we still
have time to use them.

1498
02:30:52,933 --> 02:30:54,969
We'll drive to the coast!

1499
02:30:55,333 --> 02:30:57,164
Shall we remove the files?

1500
02:30:57,573 --> 02:31:01,964
I don't care! I want to get to the
front at once... to Normandy!

1501
02:31:02,173 --> 02:31:03,242
Yes, General.

1502
02:31:06,093 --> 02:31:07,765


1503
02:31:29,493 --> 02:31:31,723
- Where is everybody?
- What?

1504
02:31:34,053 --> 02:31:36,169
I said, where is everybody?

1505
02:31:38,533 --> 02:31:40,410
I can't hear you.

1506
02:31:41,613 --> 02:31:43,410
It's them bells.

1507
02:31:43,613 --> 02:31:46,366
I've had them in my ears
for 10 hours.

1508
02:31:46,573 --> 02:31:49,451
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

1509
02:31:49,653 --> 02:31:50,972


1510
02:31:51,173 --> 02:31:53,368
Hey, Sergeant, where's Major Lance?

1511
02:31:53,573 --> 02:31:55,803
We moved the CP to that
building. The major's there.

1512
02:31:56,013 --> 02:31:57,810
Get him, the colonel's here.

1513
02:31:59,253 --> 02:32:00,368
What?

1514
02:32:02,293 --> 02:32:03,442
Hold it!

1515
02:32:13,653 --> 02:32:15,803
Colonel, am I glad to see you!

1516
02:32:16,893 --> 02:32:19,885
Those bodies. Get those bodies down.

1517
02:32:20,093 --> 02:32:22,402
Why are you leaving them up there?
Get them down!

1518
02:32:22,613 --> 02:32:24,331
But we've been under fire, sir.

1519
02:32:24,533 --> 02:32:26,444
I know you have, but I don't care!

1520
02:32:26,653 --> 02:32:28,769
Get them down! Down!

1521
02:32:29,133 --> 02:32:32,921
- I don't want those boys left there.
Take a detail and cut them down.

1522
02:32:33,133 --> 02:32:34,930
- At once!
- Yes, sir.

1523
02:32:38,973 --> 02:32:43,444
Has there been a linkup between our
forces and the troops from the sea?

1524
02:32:43,653 --> 02:32:47,726
I don't know, Major. I don't even
know if the landings took place.

1525
02:32:47,933 --> 02:32:52,529
But I am sure we're gonna hold
this town until the linkup does come.

1526
02:32:52,733 --> 02:32:57,090
Whenever that is, today, tomorrow,
till hell freezes over.

1527
02:32:58,613 --> 02:33:00,444
For their sake,
if for no other reason.

1528
02:33:00,653 --> 02:33:03,042
Show me the enemy positions.

1529
02:33:03,253 --> 02:33:06,006
Well, sir, the Germans' strong point
is right there.

1530
02:33:06,213 --> 02:33:08,932
That's over there on the hill.
They've got no tanks yet.

1531
02:33:09,133 --> 02:33:13,046
They've got heavy guns and machine
gun positions at the top of that road.

1532
02:33:13,253 --> 02:33:15,005
How many men have you got?

1533
02:33:15,733 --> 02:33:16,643
Not enough.

1534
02:33:16,893 --> 02:33:20,602
Lt. Wilson will take A Company
and reinforce Major Lance.

1535
02:33:21,253 --> 02:33:25,804
The rest of the command will follow us
straight up that road.

1536
02:33:27,013 --> 02:33:28,048
Good luck, Major.

1537
02:33:28,253 --> 02:33:30,721
All right, A Company, fall out.

1538
02:33:30,933 --> 02:33:32,924
- Private.
- Yes, sir.

1539
02:33:33,373 --> 02:33:34,249
It's a helluva war.

1540
02:33:34,453 --> 02:33:36,887
It's a privilege to serve
with you, colonel.

1541
02:33:37,093 --> 02:33:40,972
Well, God willing, we'll do
what we came here to do.

1542
02:33:41,173 --> 02:33:42,970
Ready, sir.

1543
02:33:43,253 --> 02:33:44,891
Move out!

1544
02:33:54,733 --> 02:33:58,123
The old man sure has changed
since yesterday.

1545
02:34:03,773 --> 02:34:05,968
Or maybe it's just
that we've changed...

1546
02:34:07,013 --> 02:34:08,571
...since yesterday.

1547
02:34:16,013 --> 02:34:18,527
Lovat and his commandos
have reached the bridge.

1548
02:34:19,613 --> 02:34:21,012
Bob, did you hear?

1549
02:34:21,653 --> 02:34:23,166
Yes, I heard.

1550
02:34:24,493 --> 02:34:28,850
"Sainte-Mre-Eglise captured
by units of the 82nd Airborne. "

1551
02:34:30,613 --> 02:34:33,332
" 101 Airborne driving on Utah. "

1552
02:34:33,533 --> 02:34:36,127
That's good. Good.

1553
02:34:36,533 --> 02:34:41,243
Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha
it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.

1554
02:34:41,453 --> 02:34:44,763
We'll have two cut-off beachheads,
one in British zone and one at Utah.

1555
02:34:44,973 --> 02:34:45,962
Yes...

1556
02:34:46,293 --> 02:34:48,363
...and the Germans in between.

1557
02:35:03,213 --> 02:35:04,965
You guys engineers?

1558
02:35:06,333 --> 02:35:08,005
Yes, sir. 299th.

1559
02:35:08,213 --> 02:35:11,011
Where are your officers?
Who's in charge here?

1560
02:35:11,573 --> 02:35:13,962
I guess I am, sir.
None of our officers made it in.

1561
02:35:14,173 --> 02:35:16,129
What about your equipment?
Those torpedoes work?

1562
02:35:16,333 --> 02:35:18,244
Yes, sir, we'll make them work!

1563
02:35:19,573 --> 02:35:22,133
- What's your name, Sergeant?
- It's Fuller, sir, John H.

1564
02:35:22,453 --> 02:35:25,809
You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on,
whether you like it or not.

1565
02:35:28,253 --> 02:35:31,643
You send some men down to the foot
of that gully with those torpedoes.

1566
02:35:31,893 --> 02:35:33,531
You and the rest of the men follow me.

1567
02:35:33,773 --> 02:35:35,491
Yes, sir!

1568
02:35:35,733 --> 02:35:39,123
All right, men!
Let's move that equipment down here.

1569
02:35:45,253 --> 02:35:48,529
- I got a rifle, sir.
- Well, good for you, son!

1570
02:35:49,173 --> 02:35:50,447
The Rangers are ready, General.

1571
02:35:50,653 --> 02:35:53,042
Okay, Major, move them out.

1572
02:35:53,253 --> 02:35:55,892
Captain, move them up.

1573
02:35:56,093 --> 02:35:58,209
Move them up!

1574
02:36:00,333 --> 02:36:02,130
- Well, Tom?
- We're ready.

1575
02:36:02,333 --> 02:36:03,891
As ready as we'll ever be.

1576
02:36:04,093 --> 02:36:06,812
It'll work. It's got to work.

1577
02:36:08,533 --> 02:36:12,731
We're getting murdered here! We might
as well move inland and get murdered!

1578
02:36:16,573 --> 02:36:18,086
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

1579
02:36:18,293 --> 02:36:20,853
- You're gonna blow that roadblock.
- Okay.

1580
02:36:21,053 --> 02:36:23,487
When I give the word
everything pops at once. Okay?

1581
02:36:23,733 --> 02:36:24,563
Yes, sir.

1582
02:36:51,053 --> 02:36:54,523
First, we gotta blow a hole
through that wire with bangalores.

1583
02:36:54,773 --> 02:36:57,492
If that works, we'll pack
everything we've got into that wall.

1584
02:36:59,653 --> 02:37:01,166
All right, let's go!

1585
02:39:53,493 --> 02:39:57,884
All right, let's go! Go! Go!

1586
02:40:00,893 --> 02:40:01,928


1587
02:40:03,053 --> 02:40:05,089


1588
02:40:54,773 --> 02:40:58,243
We must leave. The main highway
is under aerial attack.

1589
02:40:58,453 --> 02:41:00,045
You don't say!

1590
02:41:28,813 --> 02:41:31,043


1591
02:41:37,333 --> 02:41:39,449


1592
02:42:33,573 --> 02:42:34,972
Don't worry, Yank.

1593
02:42:39,933 --> 02:42:40,968
He's dead.

1594
02:43:01,613 --> 02:43:05,322
Give me a cigarette.
I'm dying for a cigarette.

1595
02:43:12,893 --> 02:43:14,292
You hurt bad?

1596
02:43:15,453 --> 02:43:16,772
Ack-ack.

1597
02:43:18,053 --> 02:43:19,964
Shot down during the night.

1598
02:43:23,773 --> 02:43:27,766
He was gonna make sure of me,
but I got him...

1599
02:43:28,173 --> 02:43:29,572
...with this.

1600
02:43:39,773 --> 02:43:43,561
You ever killed a man?
I mean, face to face?

1601
02:43:45,333 --> 02:43:46,288
No.

1602
02:43:47,453 --> 02:43:50,968
Neither had I, face to face.

1603
02:43:54,373 --> 02:43:56,728
I've been sitting here looking at him.

1604
02:43:58,293 --> 02:44:00,887
Have you noticed anything peculiar
about him?

1605
02:44:02,453 --> 02:44:03,568
Huh?

1606
02:44:10,373 --> 02:44:11,442
No.

1607
02:44:13,093 --> 02:44:14,765
He's got his boots...

1608
02:44:15,093 --> 02:44:17,163
...on the wrong feet.

1609
02:44:21,453 --> 02:44:22,568
Yeah.

1610
02:44:24,413 --> 02:44:26,290
He must have been
in a big hurry, huh?

1611
02:44:28,413 --> 02:44:29,607
Is it bad?

1612
02:44:32,373 --> 02:44:34,170
Split wide open...

1613
02:44:35,333 --> 02:44:37,449
...from the crotch to the knee.

1614
02:44:38,133 --> 02:44:41,967
A medic came along and gave me
a shot of morphine.

1615
02:44:44,573 --> 02:44:47,041
I hope he'll be back
before it wears off.

1616
02:44:48,173 --> 02:44:49,492
He said he would.

1617
02:44:52,333 --> 02:44:53,971
Did he sew you up?

1618
02:44:57,653 --> 02:45:01,248
Well, when he came to shore
he lost most of his equipment.

1619
02:45:04,093 --> 02:45:05,845
So he pinned it together...

1620
02:45:06,853 --> 02:45:08,844
...with safety pins.

1621
02:45:19,973 --> 02:45:21,486
Getting on toward night.

1622
02:45:29,333 --> 02:45:30,561
You know something?

1623
02:45:32,053 --> 02:45:33,964
I haven't fired my gun all day.

1624
02:45:34,453 --> 02:45:38,082
I keep hearing shooting, but every
time I get there, everybody's gone.

1625
02:45:41,813 --> 02:45:43,212
Funny, isn't it?

1626
02:45:44,533 --> 02:45:45,727
He's dead.

1627
02:45:46,933 --> 02:45:48,491
I'm crippled.

1628
02:45:49,613 --> 02:45:51,205
You're lost.

1629
02:45:53,653 --> 02:45:55,450
I suppose it's always like that.

1630
02:45:57,333 --> 02:45:58,812
I mean war.

1631
02:46:06,013 --> 02:46:07,765
I wonder who won.

1632
02:46:48,893 --> 02:46:51,453
Okay, run me up the hill, son.

1633
02:50:56,293 --> 02:50:57,282
