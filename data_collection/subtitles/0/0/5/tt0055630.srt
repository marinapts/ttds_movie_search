Stop, you brat!

Let me go, Father!

22
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,839
This battle
is the chance of a lifetime!

23
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,943
Crazy fool!
The chance to get killed!

24
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,806
Why do you want
to be a gambler?

25
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,074
A farmer's place
is in the fields.

26
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,811
A long life eating gruel -
to hell with that!

27
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,482
I want good food
and nice clothes.

28
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,885
I'm gonna live it up
and die young!

29
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,068
Old man.

30
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,328
I'd like some water.

31
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,866
Why the hell didn't you stop him?

32
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,874
How could I?

33
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:47,153
Kids these days are all mad.

34
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,051
It's not just the kids.

35
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,523
Everyone wants easy money.

36
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,420
It's all thanks to gambling.

37
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,996
A roll of the dice and you're rich.

38
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,362
Can't tell whose money
is whose anymore.

39
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,308
Have you heard
the sake brewer's trading silk now?

40
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,177
Says he'll pay more
than the silk merchant.

41
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,840
Yes, but...

42
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,983
what difference does it make...

43
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,089
with the town the way it is?

44
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:30,362
We don't even know
when the next silk fair will open.

45
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,395
Hungry dogs come running
when they smell blood.

46
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,974
Let 'em rip each other apart
and dye the silk in their blood.

47
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,609
Then they can have
their stinkin' fair!

48
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,244
SILK MERCHANT

49
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,976
Samurai, wanna make
some dough as a bodyguard?

50
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,480
The going rate has hit the roof.

51
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,519
My commission's one ryo.

52
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,416
Which side will you take?

53
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,992
Seibei Manome runs a brothel.
All the women you want.

54
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,855
But he's going downhill.

55
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,222
I'd bet on Ushitora Shinden.

56
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,923
Look.

57
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,763
The inn at the corner.
That's his place.

58
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,803
Tell him Constable Hansuke
sent you.

59
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:35,203
I'd take you myself,
but I'm the law around here.

60
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,379
Don't forget, now.
I get one ryo.

61
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,372
Go ahead.

62
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,413
It's a public road.
Even dogs pass freely!

63
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,027
You won't get hired like that.

64
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,798
You gotta act big,
show 'em who's boss.

65
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,835
They only look tough.

66
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:16,272
Chop off one of their arms
and they'll behave.

67
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,817
Then you'll get hired.

68
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,042
Mind your own business,
you bastard!

69
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,454
Come in.

70
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,916
RESTAURANT

71
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,997
- Sake?
- Food.

72
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,335
There's no business these days,
so I don't have anything.

73
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,135
Even the rice is cold.

74
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,878
I don't mind.

75
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,146
Actually, old man -

76
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,287
I know.
You can't pay.

77
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,594
I'll bust some heads first.

78
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,263
No!

79
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,660
I've seen enough fighting!

80
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,997
The food's on me,
but then get the hell out of town!

81
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,141
Thanks.

82
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,309
There he goes again!

83
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,142
The casket maker.

84
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,482
Only guy in town
making any money.

85
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,319
Can't make coffins fast enough.

86
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,497
It's best not to have
any gamblers at all.

87
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:42,256
One boss to a town
we can tolerate,

88
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,232
but two is a disaster.

89
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,406
Only the casket maker
profits from that.

90
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,574
Knock it off, you bastard!

91
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,508
Gamblers are
so cold-blooded and greedy,

92
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,181
you wouldn't think
they'd have paternal feelings.

93
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:06,088
But all this trouble started
when Seibei decided

94
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,591
to give all his territory
to his son.

95
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,663
His right-hand man
wouldn't stand for it.

96
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,097
Ushitora's his name, a real -

97
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,736
Strange name.

98
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,736
His ma began labor
in the year of the cow, Ushi,

99
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,399
but he bounced out
in the new year of the tiger, Tora.

100
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,239
Talk about ringing in
the New Year with a plague.

101
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:34,044
He left Seibei to start a rival gang,
taking half of Seibei's men with him.

102
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,279
Only swords can settle things now.

103
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,951
They're both fuming, rounding up
drifters and criminals for their gangs.

104
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:49,330
Instead of buying silk,
they're buying thugs.

105
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,911
How's business, casket man?

106
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,313
How many coffins did you sell
while I was away last night?

107
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,950
Two to your side.

108
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,143
What?

109
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,889
And four to the other side.

110
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,722
Not too bad.

111
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,514
Ushitora's brother, Inokichi.
A wild boar, befitting his name.

112
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,685
He's a half-wit,
but dangerous when mad.

113
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,014
He's returned
with three new recruits.

114
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:05,368
What a disgrace!
That's our constable.

115
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,843
He's supposed to arrest the riffraff,
but just look at him.

116
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,539
He's not the only one, though.

117
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,977
Have a look.

118
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,817
An imposing facade, but the owner
Tazaemon is worthless.

119
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,959
He's our cowardly mayor,
a silk merchant by trade.

120
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,131
He'd managed to survive
by siding with Seibei,

121
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,030
but when Ushitora rebelled...

122
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,140
Tokuemon, the sake brewer,
sided with Ushitora.

123
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,972
Tokuemon says
he's the new mayor,

124
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,742
and he even started selling silk.
Tazaemon is finished.

125
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:50,285
He bangs his prayer drum all day,
hoping for Seibei's victory.

126
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,891
Hear that?

127
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,431
Damn them all!

128
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,541
This town is doomed.

129
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,776
Now do you see?

130
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:20,140
You'll gain nothing
by getting sucked into this evil.

131
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,883
Eat quickly and leave.

132
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,225
I've had enough rice.
Give me some sake.

133
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,464
I like it here.
I'll stay awhile.

134
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,332
Why?

135
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,798
Don't you get it yet?

136
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,698
Yes, I do.

137
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,007
That's why I'm staying.

138
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,569
Listen, old man.

139
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,973
I'll get paid for killing.

140
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,082
And this town is full of men
who deserve to die.

141
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,210
Think about it.

142
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,155
Seibei, Ushitora,
the gamblers and drifters -

143
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,724
with them gone,
the town could have a fresh start.

144
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,953
You're nuts!
Not if you had nine lives!

145
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,458
I won't do it alone.

146
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,334
How then?

147
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,372
Sake.
I'll think while I drink.

148
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,710
Everyone in this town is crazy!

149
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,715
But you're even crazier!

150
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,868
I want to talk to Seibei.

151
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,043
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

152
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,790
Wanna hire me?

153
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,934
I'll be your bodyguard.

154
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,995
I'll show you what I'm worth.

155
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,456
The two-bit samurai again?

156
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,297
What do you want this time?

157
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,583
- You guys have such cute faces.
- What?

158
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:46,016
You talk tough but couldn't hurt a fly.
Adorable.

159
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,456
Don't take us for fools.
See this tattoo?

160
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,028
I wasn't in prison for nothing!

161
00:18:56,235 --> 00:19:01,263
I'm a wanted fugitive.
They'll crucify me if I'm caught.

162
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,264
Same here.

163
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,042
They'll stick my head on a pike.

164
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,012
Not to brag, but I've committed
every crime in the book.

165
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,184
So you won't mind
if I kill you?

166
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,513
- What?
- Kill us if you can!

167
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:18,917
It'll hurt.

168
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,285
We're gamblers.
We ain't afraid of the sword.

169
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,227
There's no cure for fools.

170
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,456
What?

171
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,478
Casket maker. Two coffins.

172
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,749
No, better make that three.

173
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,872
All right, make me an offer.

174
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,237
What'll you pay me
to finish them off?

175
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:16,346
How about three <i>ryo?</i>

176
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,747
I'm going to Ushitora.
I bet he'll pay more.

177
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,754
Four then!

178
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:24,923
Five!

179
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,658
Six!

180
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,258
Add a zero to the end.

181
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,759
Ten! I'll pay you ten!

182
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,403
Twenty!

183
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,797
Twenty-five!

184
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,779
Thirty!

185
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,649
All right!

186
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,642
Fifty!

187
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,288
Very well.

188
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,592
Twenty-five in advance,
with room and board.

189
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,243
My men wish
to welcome you.

190
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,274
But first, a drink.

191
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,441
We gotta talk.

192
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,114
Stupid wench has no manners.

193
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:11,118
<i>You're mad to pay 25 in advance</i>
<i>to a complete stranger.</i>

194
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,097
<i>What if he runs off in the night?</i>

195
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:16,358
Leave it to me.
He won't have time.

196
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,694
I plan to attack today.

197
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:23,398
Ushitora's men must be terrified
after he killed three of their gang.

198
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:27,100
We'll win for sure
with him leading us.

199
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,711
I see.

200
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,016
But then we'll have
to pay him 25 more.

201
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:38,183
What if we kill him afterwards?
We'd get the whole 50 back.

202
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,824
- That's going too far!
- Quiet!

203
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,927
If you can't even do that,
forget about being the heir.

204
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,824
Honor means nothing
to gamblers.

205
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,828
Your mother's right.

206
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,901
You can't build a fortune unless
you're known as a killer and a thief.

207
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,263
You kill that two-bit samurai.

208
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:03,412
Treat him nice and he'll let down
his guard. It'll be easy.

209
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,779
The men won't respect you
unless you show you can kill.

210
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,581
But I killed
one of Ushitora's men!

211
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,815
One man!
Don't flatter yourself!

212
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:17,927
Some son you are.
What are you so afraid of?

213
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:22,827
Whether you kill one or one hundred,
you only hang once!

214
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,639
Twenty-five ryo exactly.

215
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,092
Master, let's drink
and get acquainted.

216
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,195
My son, Yoichiro.

217
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,560
My wife, Orin.

218
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,636
My four strongest men:
Magotaro, Yahachi,

219
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,500
Matsukichi and Sukeju.

220
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,240
Where's Master Homma?

221
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,777
By the way,
may I ask your name?

222
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,851
Me?

223
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:28,098
Sanjuro Kuwabatake...
(30-year-old Mulberry Field)

224
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,268
But I'm almost 40.

225
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,959
You must be joking!

226
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,965
As names go,
it's good enough.

227
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,733
I'm a complete stranger, anyway.

228
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:54,386
Master, why sit over there?
Come sit here.

229
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,060
Here will do.

230
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,721
He gets 50 ryo, and I only get two.
He's in a different class.

231
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,796
Someday I'll show you
my true worth.

232
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,098
Maybe sooner than you think.
How about today?

233
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,773
We raid today at noon!

234
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,972
In plain daylight, boss?

235
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,916
We haven't won until we kill
Ushitora and Inokichi.

236
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,154
They could run away at night.

237
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,089
Don't be afraid!

238
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:35,322
With Homma and this master leading us,
we're stronger than ever.

239
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:08,492
Twelve o'clock noon!

240
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,011
Hurry up!
What are you doing?

241
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,958
You're not gonna sneak away
that easily! Get in there!

242
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,763
We paid a lot for you!

243
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,267
Get in!

244
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,616
Master, please come!

245
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,832
Master, please hurry!
Ushitora's men have come out!

246
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,894
All right, follow the master!

247
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,837
You wanna fight?
Do it yourself.

248
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,810
I'm not interested.

249
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,948
Sorry, missus,

250
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,018
but I don't intend
to be killed after your victory.

251
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,984
Here's your 25 ryo.

252
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,290
Son of a bitch!
Chickening out at the last minute!

253
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,960
Where's Homma?

254
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,358
Find him!
- He ran away in broad daylight.

255
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,337
Which one of you is Ushitora?

256
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,776
I am.

257
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,411
What do you want?

258
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,382
Seibei has offended me.
I've cut my ties with him.

259
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,124
That's all.

260
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,387
Why, you -

261
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,441
Watch out!
This fight's gonna be bad!

262
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,746
It's gonna be bad!

263
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,828
What're you waiting for?
You can't back down now!

264
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,229
All right!

265
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:50,200
An inspector from Edo is coming!

266
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,151
You got lucky this time,
you swine.

267
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:10,224
You're the lucky one!
Your head is mine when he leaves!

268
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,988
All you fugitives hurry up and hide!

269
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,957
The same goes for all of you!

270
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,829
Tell everyone
to open their doors!

271
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,601
All's quiet around here, got it?
Not even the dogs are fighting.

272
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,407
Open up!

273
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,377
Open shop!
Act as if everything's normal!

274
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,115
Got that?

275
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,415
Old man...

276
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:15,149
that inspector's a nobody,
but he sure has a swank palanquin.

277
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,899
What's so funny?

278
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,908
His men are drinking tea.

279
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,510
So?

280
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,504
Take a look.

281
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,519
Spiked tea.

282
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,693
Don't be so angry.

283
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:05,898
If I could've had them
massacre each other,

284
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,045
it would've spared me
a big housecleaning.

285
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,248
Too bad they were interrupted.
- Get out!

286
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,142
You're out of your mind!

287
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,478
You think so?

288
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:20,089
It's obvious. You think they'll
just overlook what you did?

289
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,555
Ushitora and Seibei
won't stand quietly by.

290
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,160
Sure, they'll come
talk to me eventually.

291
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,990
Question is, who'll show up
with a pile of money first?

292
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:37,405
All they care about is winning,
so they both want me.

293
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,778
Just wait and see.

294
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:52,384
Hey, is that your nitwit mayor?

295
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,839
Is that Tokuemon?

296
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,382
Now it makes sense.

297
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,955
No wonder the inspector
has such a nice palanquin.

298
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,754
By the way,
I'd like a drink too.

299
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,764
You've got nerve!
You're stone broke!

300
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,228
You want something?

301
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,034
You're tough.

302
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,936
I like you.

303
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,240
Aren't you angry
I killed three of your men?

304
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,574
They were worthless.

305
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,213
I'm Ushitora's brother -

306
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,320
- Inokichi.
- You know me?

307
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,091
I hear you're strong.

308
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,287
Not that strong.

309
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,359
Master!

310
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,030
Don't be a stranger.
Have a drink with us.

311
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,100
Or are you still angry?

312
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,568
- I should ask that of you.
- Don't be mean.

313
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,401
You took my joking
too seriously, silly man.

314
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,076
Come on, let's go.

315
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,440
No, you don't.
We were gonna have a drink.

316
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,613
Right? Start the sake flowing!

317
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,808
Make it your best.
It's on me.

318
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:45,386
Never!
My brother'd beat me to a pulp!

319
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,319
And I'd be kicked out of the house!

320
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,327
- Bitch!
- Yeah, what?

321
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,415
Hey, casket maker.

322
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,189
Drowning your sorrows?

323
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,299
The inspector's long visit
must have killed your business.

324
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,168
You've stayed ten days
already yourself.

325
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,962
Don't be like that.

326
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,867
Your shop has flourished
because of me.

327
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,872
Shut up!
This isn't a brothel.

328
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,568
If you want a place to stay,
go to Seibei's.

329
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,047
Bad idea.
Both sides are fighting for me.

330
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,751
I'll stay here
and let them keep hoping.

331
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,935
Everyone but him out.

332
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,702
Come to my place. Now.

333
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,670
What's the rush?

334
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,468
The inspector's leaving tomorrow.

335
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:54,608
A magistrate was killed
in a town 24 miles from here.

336
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,818
He doesn't seem too concerned.

337
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,958
He won't learn of it until tonight.

338
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,195
You seem to know everything.

339
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,500
Was the magistrate's murder
your doing?

340
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,405
Possibly.

341
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,503
The inspector's presence
is costing me a lot.

342
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,338
So are my hired men.

343
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,747
I see.

344
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,047
Speaking of which,
here's 30 in advance.

345
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,050
Thirty more if we win.
Come right away.

346
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:37,421
I'd feel bad not giving Seibei
a chance to better your offer.

347
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:40,825
Ready to exploit any weakness,
aren't you?

348
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,589
Tough luck.

349
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,398
I'll decide my price
after the inspector leaves.

350
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,285
Cheer up.
The inspector's leaving.

351
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,116
Really?

352
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,015
Fantastic!

353
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,803
What did Ushitora want?

354
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,045
Son of a bitch!
The slaughter's gonna start again?

355
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,407
Looks like it.

356
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,933
What's taking them so long?

357
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,937
It's about time one of them
made me an offer.

358
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,643
Some samurai.
All you talk about is money.

359
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,310
This is dangerous and dirty work.

360
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,643
It's only worth it
if the price is right.

361
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,411
You'd only be a bodyguard.

362
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,819
With some bodyguards,

363
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:17,983
the employers
have to watch their backs.

364
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:49,016
What's that fool up to?
He's been running back and forth all day.

365
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,803
Gonji, a bottle of sake.

366
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,942
Forget it. I'm not gonna
let you celebrate the butchery!

367
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,737
I'm not! I'm miserable!

368
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,204
They're making peace.

369
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,940
They are?

370
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,314
And I bought
a lot of lumber for coffins.

371
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,489
What do I do now?

372
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,158
I'm sorry for you guys,
but now the town will quiet down.

373
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,589
You idiot!

374
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,698
Gamblers only make peace
to prepare for a bigger fight.

375
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,829
They can't have the silk fair
if they're fighting.

376
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,369
No silk fair means
no gambling rooms

377
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:39,099
and no income from their territory,
so they make up for a while.

378
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,870
A truce is merely the seed
for an even bloodier battle.

379
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,570
You got that?

380
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,045
There's nothing more dangerous.

381
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:56,116
Still, they were so determined
to destroy each other.

382
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,491
How'd they manage
to calm down?

383
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,291
I think Unosuke suggested it.

384
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:03,466
Unosuke?

385
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:08,195
Ushitora's youngest brother.
He returned last night from his travels.

386
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,739
Evil bastard came back, did he?

387
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:15,168
He looks as gentle
as the zodiac Rabbit he's named after,

388
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,109
but he's a wolf inside.

389
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:26,217
<i>A whole year you've been gone.</i>
<i>Even the winds welcome you!</i>

390
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,351
Want to see
something interesting?

391
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,249
What's going on?

392
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,817
Same thing at your place?

393
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,121
Makin' fools of us!

394
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:43,197
They end their feud, then send us away
with crumbs in our pockets!

395
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,360
Sons of bitches!

396
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,571
We'll show 'em!

397
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,707
Bastards!

398
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,683
What are they moaning about?

399
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,319
Ushitora made us
risk our lives,

400
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:17,330
and that was just yesterday!

401
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,024
Hachi, quiet!

402
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,233
I'll tell ya, Kuma,

403
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,907
I can't take it anymore!

404
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:35,451
Let's go report it to the law.

405
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,879
Then that Ushitora's gonna -

406
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,655
That hurt!

407
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,260
Get up!

408
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,195
Let's go!

409
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,766
Why'd you do that?

410
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,383
- Come on!
- No!

411
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,901
Ushitora's a real bastard.

412
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,173
Where the hell
did you come from?

413
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:34,743
What'd he pay you to kill
that magistrate? One <i>ryo?</i>

414
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:38,847
Don't we wish!
Just two silver pieces.

415
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,448
That's a raw deal.

416
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,117
But the information
will come in handy.

417
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,593
You're a gold mine.

418
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:56,461
Now I can blackmail Ushitora,
or even sell you to Seibei.

419
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:12,146
Get up.

420
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,017
Get up!

421
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,471
It's a bargain.

422
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,915
If you take them and report it,

423
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,784
Ushitora's done for.

424
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,720
But boss,
what about our truce?

425
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:01,295
Your son and Unosuke are negotiating
at the mayor's place now.

426
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,125
So what?

427
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:07,335
It'd be perfect if Ushitora
got arrested during the talks.

428
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,807
Ready, ladies?

429
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,409
Haven't had a woman in a while,
have you?

430
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:58,246
Take your pick and have fun.

431
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,349
It's dangerous around here.

432
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,192
Wait!

433
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,058
Take care of your purchase.

434
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,894
It would be a total loss
if Ushitora got them back.

435
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,593
Lock them up
in the storehouse.

436
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,584
Get me Ushitora.

437
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,949
Who the hell -

438
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,525
Get me Ushitora!

439
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,498
Boss!

440
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:52,197
<i>What is it?</i>

441
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,077
So it's you, is it?

442
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,747
I don't need a bodyguard
at the moment.

443
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,786
Too bad you turned down
my earlier offer.

444
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,658
Hachi talks too much.

445
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:16,627
If you're too cheap,
you pay more in the long run.

446
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,868
Two silver pieces -
what an insult.

447
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:25,501
He and Kuma got drunk
and blurted out everything.

448
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,803
Those bastards!
Where the hell are they?

449
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:33,182
One of Seibei's men overheard them
and captured them.

450
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:37,178
I followed. They're locked up
in Seibei's storehouse.

451
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,955
Sons of bitches!

452
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,659
You don't get
information like this for free.

453
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,296
Take as much as you want.

454
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,860
You're my bodyguard
from now on.

455
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:03,071
This is enough for now.
I'll consider the bodyguard part.

456
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:13,815
Uno, you don't know him, do you?
This guy's tough as hell.

457
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:25,826
<i>Ino! Uno! What are you doing?</i>
<i>Get in here now!</i>

458
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,561
What is it?

459
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,562
Don't kill Yoichiro!

460
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,899
Get his sword
and take him to Brother!

461
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,911
Get going!

462
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,265
Seibei!

463
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,738
We have Yoichiro!

464
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,340
Did you hear me?

465
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,443
Listen carefully,
and don't try anything funny.

466
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:46,871
If you want him back,
bring us Kuma and Hachi!

467
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,017
We'll trade!

468
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,210
Each side will send
three unarmed men

469
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,390
to the guard tower at 2:00 a.m.!

470
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,218
Got that?

471
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,333
- Pretty good.
- It'll get better. Just watch.

472
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,140
Don't forget
to call the hour at 2:00!

473
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,089
Old man,
give me something to eat.

474
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,417
Take what you want
from the pot.

475
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:35,288
I won't get any business
with all this trouble brewing.

476
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,603
You know, old man,

477
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:46,168
this town is starting to boil again,
just like this pot.

478
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,143
What have you done?

479
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,806
Did you write
this new little drama?

480
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,507
Half of it.

481
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,483
Unosuke just rewrote
the other half.

482
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,600
It's 2:00 a.m.!

483
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,316
Ready, Ushitora?

484
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,155
We're coming, Seibei!

485
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,328
I'll push them forward,

486
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,057
and you let go of your rope.

487
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,768
Seibei!

488
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,844
That was a dirty trick.

489
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,241
We're even now.

490
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,579
If you love Yoichiro,

491
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:12,015
shave your head and ask
my brother to take over as heir.

492
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:14,315
Just as I thought!

493
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:17,651
Uno, look here!

494
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,346
Hey, Ushitora,
you see this?

495
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,847
I'll be keeping her!

496
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:45,245
Ask the horny old sake brewer
what he says to that!

497
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,797
That was amusing.

498
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,231
<i>Mommy!</i>

499
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,004
Where's my mommy?

500
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,683
I'll show you.

501
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,839
Don't you want to look?

502
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,611
I can't see her!

503
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:34,221
You will soon.

504
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,929
Mommy!

505
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,836
Kenbo!

506
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,282
Nui!

507
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,660
Hansuke, hurry up!

508
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,262
Mommy!

509
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:27,642
Coward! Why didn't you
bite your tongue off and die?

510
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,745
You caused us so much trouble!
Ungrateful bastard!

511
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,481
Hurry up!

512
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,246
Come on!

513
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:56,868
Seibei!

514
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,872
You'll be hearing from me!

515
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,808
I can't wait!
I've got a few things planned myself!

516
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,186
Don't come any closer.

517
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,201
He cried himself to sleep.

518
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:44,753
Poor fellow.
His wife was too beautiful.

519
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:49,680
It all started when he lost
to Ushitora at gambling.

520
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:54,495
If she were ugly,
he'd only have lost his house.

521
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:59,327
But old Tokuemon
was drooling all over her.

522
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:03,062
Ushitora saw a chance
to draw Tokuemon to his side.

523
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:09,209
He took the wife and house
and dangled them in front of Tokuemon.

524
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:13,747
This poor fool built a hut
right next to his former house

525
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:19,477
just so he could watch helplessly
as Tokuemon ravishes his wife every day.

526
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:23,447
I don't want her anymore!
I gave her up for good!

527
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,923
Then why the heartbroken look?

528
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,662
Going home?

529
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:43,339
Won't you get beaten up?
Weren't you told not to see her?

530
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,514
I'm used to it.

531
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,811
I don't mind.

532
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:02,361
Ushitora has his men
watching over her.

533
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,624
She can't even see her son.

534
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:09,532
Good-bye.

535
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:16,639
Guys like that make me sick!

536
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,854
I've decided
to be your bodyguard.

537
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,719
You have my gratitude.

538
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:07,852
I want 30 in advance.

539
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,564
That's a steep price.
I'd refuse if I were you.

540
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:15,498
But he's so tough!

541
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,373
Tougher than this?

542
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:24,910
Don't say that, Uno.
If I refuse, he'll go to Seibei.

543
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:26,741
That would be bad!

544
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,712
Buy him then.

545
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,625
Here. Thirty ryo.

546
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,854
Thirty more when we win.

547
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,965
Of course.
You have my word.

548
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,297
If that's settled, let's drink to it.
To our partnership!

549
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:52,972
Fine, but is the woman safe?

550
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:54,539
What woman?

551
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,644
Tokuemon's woman.

552
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,974
If they get her again,
you'll lose for sure.

553
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,242
Don't worry.
I've got six roughnecks on watch.

554
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:05,545
That's not enough.

555
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,315
You need at least one
as tough as this guy.

556
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,224
Brother, should I go?

557
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,330
I'll go along
and see how they're doing.

558
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,795
Thanks.

559
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,269
It ain't a fun job.

560
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:28,165
You gotta stand in the cold
when Tokuemon comes around.

561
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,547
He doesn't seem
to be here now.

562
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,683
Is that where the jackass
who lost his wife lives?

563
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,949
I almost forgot!
I gotta beat him up!

564
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,530
Hey, you!

565
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,996
Hanging around
Tokuemon's woman, huh?

566
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:55,795
How many times
we gotta tell you not to see her?

567
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,241
Ino, there's trouble!
Everyone's dead!

568
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:05,044
All six men have been killed!
Tell Ushitora, quick!

569
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:13,052
Who's there?

570
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,966
Get your husband and run!

571
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,078
Idiot!

572
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:44,651
Mommy!

573
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,254
Nui!

574
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,755
Run for it!

575
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,394
Here's 30 ryo.
I stole it from Ushitora.

576
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,259
Take it.

577
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:25,987
You idiots!

578
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,587
What are you waiting for?

579
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,660
Stop that!

580
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:38,759
I hate pathetic weaklings!
Start crying and I'll kill you!

581
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,762
Ushitora's coming!

582
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,109
Get lost!

583
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:49,942
We'll thank you later.

584
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,409
Idiot! Don't ever come back here!

585
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,776
Thank you.

586
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:57,176
Thank you.

587
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,159
- What happened?
- Take a look.

588
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,403
What a mess.

589
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,940
Didn't I tell you?

590
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,648
Six men weren't enough.

591
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,489
Must have been
15 or 16 men.

592
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:47,532
Where's the wench?

593
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,135
Gone, of course.

594
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,340
Seibei's pretty clever.

595
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,136
Brother!

596
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:03,041
Son of a bitch!

597
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:12,421
My silk's burning!
Please put out the fire!

598
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,687
I'll give you anything!

599
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,965
Don't move!

600
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,671
Hand over the wench
and we'll save the shop!

601
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,038
What wench?

602
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,876
Don't play dumb!
Give her back or else!

603
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,615
- What are you talking about?
- Shut up!

604
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:04,102
My sake's pouring out!

605
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,941
Do something!

606
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,881
Stop up the holes!

607
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:21,529
I'll give you anything!

608
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,973
Help!

609
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:41,112
This is Seibei's doing!

610
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,244
Come with me, men!

611
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:43,234
What happened?
Why so glum?

612
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,447
Your business should be booming.

613
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:48,843
No.

614
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:53,351
When the fighting gets this bad,
they don't bother with coffins.

615
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,136
Another bottle.

616
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:13,740
Comin' right up.

617
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,910
You're unusually friendly today.
What's going on?

618
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,846
Gives me the creeps.

619
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,583
Aren't you angry that I became
Ushitora's bodyguard?

620
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,449
Not at all.

621
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,690
You're not a bad guy
after all.

622
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:37,831
What?

623
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,694
You're not really bad.
You just pretend to be.

624
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:46,407
He came by last night.

625
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:47,632
Who?

626
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,869
The man who makes you sick.

627
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:55,381
He told me everything.
Oh, and another thing.

628
01:15:56,818 --> 01:16:00,584
He said to give you this.

629
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:06,526
Aren't you going to read it?

630
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:11,094
Sure, it's just a long,
tedious thank-you note.

631
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,463
But read it.
He risked his life to bring it.

632
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,571
Shut up!
I'm busy drinking!

633
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,717
We need to talk.

634
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:34,954
About what?

635
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:43,921
Ino just got back
from a recruiting expedition.

636
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,494
- Get any men?
- No.

637
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,329
No wonder.

638
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:54,268
None of your former hires
are exactly singing your praises.

639
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:59,846
But Ino heard an interesting story
from one man.

640
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:06,285
He saw Tokuemon's woman crossing
the ridge with her husband and little brat.

641
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:11,216
That was the morning
after our six men were killed.

642
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:18,492
Which means that
Seibei didn't kidnap her.

643
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,865
It would seem that way.

644
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,529
Then who killed our men?

645
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:32,536
Ino, before you came running
to tell Brother,

646
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,945
did you see those men dead
with your own eyes?

647
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,779
No. He told me -

648
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:56,696
By the way, those six
were sliced up real good.

649
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:02,038
You're the only one around here
that skilled with a sword.

650
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,369
So?

651
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,439
It occurred to me...

652
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:12,811
that maybe you killed them.

653
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:17,253
But Uno, he's our bodyguard.

654
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:19,560
Why would he do that?

655
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:26,499
That's what I don't get either.

656
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,726
Hold it.

657
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,663
What's this?

658
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,142
"To the honorable samurai

659
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:41,171
from Kohei and Nui."

660
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,832
You sure it's okay
to leave him untied?

661
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:39,768
Sure. He's nothing
without his sword.

662
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,638
Where am I?

663
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,014
This is the brewery.

664
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:50,546
This is the gate to hell.

665
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,419
Watch it!

666
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,352
A pat from you is like
a beating from a normal man.

667
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,572
You want another thrashing?

668
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,891
Where are you going?

669
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:42,535
That's the shortcut to hell.

670
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:50,906
You're not supposed to kill him.

671
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:53,774
Don't worry.
He's still groaning.

672
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,243
Do you know who I am?

673
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,447
Then listen.

674
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:30,743
Master Tokuemon
wants to talk to you personally.

675
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:41,658
You must know
where the woman is.

676
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:50,527
You can't trust him.
He's out to save his own skin.

677
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,572
The master's talking.
You keep quiet.

678
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:03,141
I dislike long-winded talk.

679
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:07,420
The quicker we settle this,
the better.

680
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:12,454
Tell me where the woman is.

681
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:17,824
In return, I'll let you live.

682
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:24,666
What's the matter?
It's a generous offer.

683
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,807
You're not going to refuse,
are you?

684
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,307
I won't talk!

685
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:32,908
What?

686
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,781
- Wait! Don't kill him!
- Don't worry.

687
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,821
Kannuki, teach him a lesson.

688
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:56,426
How about it?
You gonna talk?

689
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,072
Hell no, you half-wit!

690
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,986
Don't kill him.

691
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:21,159
Don't get blood
on that storage chest.

692
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,137
Thanks to him,
we have to sleep here now.

693
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:56,317
I'm gonna beat him up again.
He's getting on my nerves.

694
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:06,358
Huh? I could've sworn
I locked this door.

695
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:08,991
The bastard's gone.

696
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,324
What?
Don't scare me like that!

697
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:21,334
Brother, this isn't funny!

698
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:08,849
Morons!

699
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,451
No point looking where it's light!
Search where it's dark!

700
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,839
Old man, open up!

701
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,804
It's me.

702
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:05,924
I know I'm quite a sight,
but could you do your staring later?

703
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,117
Didn't I warn you?
You're too damn reckless.

704
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:36,557
Save your lecture!
They'll be here soon!

705
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:43,266
Tell them I went to Seibei's place.
Got that?

706
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:03,445
Did that two-bit samurai come here?
Lie and you'll be sorry!

707
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:06,684
Yes, but he went
to Seibei's place.

708
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:11,698
Don't believe the old fool.
He and Two-Bit are in cahoots.

709
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:15,494
But Seibei would gladly hide him
to find out where the slut is.

710
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:17,395
That guy's really something.

711
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:20,005
He wouldn't stay put
with his head cut off.

712
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:23,234
Fine. We'll kill
Seibei's entire gang.

713
01:31:23,444 --> 01:31:25,969
I only held back
because of the woman.

714
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:29,479
Gather some straw
and smoke them out.

715
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:33,585
Smoke 'em out like raccoons
and kill 'em? Fun!

716
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:06,382
Pull yourself together.

717
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:10,520
But what'll you do now?

718
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:13,626
Go next door
and buy a coffin.

719
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:17,562
How can you give up like that?

720
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:19,398
You idiot!

721
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:22,566
I'm not dying yet.

722
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:25,203
There's a bunch of guys
I have to kill first.

723
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:57,195
Is this safe?
What if Ushitora's men check?

724
01:32:57,405 --> 01:33:00,306
They don't have time.
Take a look.

725
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:02,165
<i>What's Ushitora doing?</i>

726
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:06,210
Smoking out Seibei
and his men.

727
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,111
<i>Sounds interesting.</i>
<i>Set me down. I wanna watch.</i>

728
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:11,510
That's crazy!

729
01:33:11,719 --> 01:33:13,277
<i>Set me down!</i>

730
01:33:20,962 --> 01:33:23,863
<i>I can't see from here.</i>
<i>Move further out.</i>

731
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:38,335
<i>Uno, it's me! Don't shoot!</i>

732
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,473
Idiot!
Don't leave your post!

733
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,612
Kannuki's guarding the back.

734
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:51,547
Listen, I killed those two guys
who killed three of ours.

735
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:54,550
You came out to tell me that?
Get back in there!

736
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:10,697
You won't get away,
you wench!

737
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:13,738
Come here, you greedy bitch!

738
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:15,407
Where are Seibei and Yoichiro?

739
01:35:15,609 --> 01:35:18,009
- I don't know!
- Tell us or we'll kill you!

740
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:26,319
Mommy!

741
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:36,261
Seibei, come out!
Yoichiro's begging for mercy!

742
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:39,496
Seibei!

743
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:44,330
<i>You win! I'm coming out!</i>
<i>Don't kill me</i> or <i>my son!</i>

744
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:45,903
All right!

745
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:55,137
All my territory is yours!

746
01:35:55,349 --> 01:35:57,317
You can take over!

747
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:06,086
You filthy scum!

748
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:24,977
Only the samurai is left.

749
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:26,471
Where is he?

750
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,740
- There's nobody in there.
- That can't be.

751
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:34,643
- See for yourself.
- He can't just vanish.

752
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:38,188
He's all beaten up.
He can't go far.

753
01:36:41,862 --> 01:36:45,320
Old man, let's get going.

754
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:50,601
Son of a bitch!

755
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:52,836
The casket maker ran away!

756
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:56,334
That's not good.
Anyone else around?

757
01:36:58,345 --> 01:37:00,006
It gets worse.

758
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:03,415
Inokichi's coming this way!

759
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:06,585
We have no choice.
Talk him into helping you.

760
01:37:06,787 --> 01:37:09,950
- But -
- Just try it!

761
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:16,529
- Just in case.
- Thanks.

762
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,243
Hey, whaddaya doin'?

763
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:36,072
The casket maker and I
were gonna bury this body,

764
01:37:36,283 --> 01:37:38,774
but the bastard got scared
and ran off.

765
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:40,817
Would you give me a hand?

766
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:43,387
Are you kidding?
Hell, no!

767
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:48,252
- Afraid of a dead man?
- What did you say?

768
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:50,521
You talk big, but fear's
written all over your face.

769
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:53,529
What?
I'm not afraid of nothin'!

770
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:55,565
Then hurry up and help.

771
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:57,464
Couldn't be easier.

772
01:37:57,671 --> 01:38:02,233
You sure? We're going to the cemetery.
I saw ghosts there a while back.

773
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:03,910
Ghosts?

774
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:06,412
Hell, I see ghosts
and I feel relieved!

775
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:08,980
Good. Let's go then.

776
01:38:25,966 --> 01:38:29,060
- Is this far enough?
- Yes, thanks.

777
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:36,238
Where are the ghosts?

778
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:40,174
They only appear
to scaredy-cats like me,

779
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:42,246
not to brave guys like you.

780
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:48,678
I'd feel bad leaving you here alone.
I'll help you bury him.

781
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:52,818
That's all right.
Weren't you looking for someone?

782
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,628
You're right!
Brother's gonna beat me!

783
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:16,075
Are you all right?

784
01:39:17,217 --> 01:39:19,014
That was all very amusing.

785
01:39:19,219 --> 01:39:23,918
Can you walk?
There's a small temple nearby.

786
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:26,091
I can walk.

787
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:38,969
You don't look like
one of the living.

788
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:45,277
I'll come back to life
with a few days' sleep.

789
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:50,515
It's even worse
when you smile.

790
01:40:36,797 --> 01:40:38,731
You're late, old man.

791
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,830
I'm hungry.

792
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:44,829
It's me!
Gonji's in trouble!

793
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:48,408
What happened?

794
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:50,440
He got caught
on the way here.

795
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:54,045
The rice and ointment for you
gave him away.

796
01:40:56,116 --> 01:40:57,879
Where'd they take him?

797
01:40:58,085 --> 01:41:01,612
Seibei's place.
Ushitora has moved in there.

798
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:06,416
You plan to fight with that?

799
01:41:06,693 --> 01:41:08,923
- I'll make sashimi outta them!
- Wait.

800
01:41:10,664 --> 01:41:14,532
Use this. Being a coffin maker
has its advantages.

801
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:19,172
It's wrong to use a dead man's sword,
but it's the best I had.

802
01:43:02,943 --> 01:43:08,074
Get away while he's fighting
Ushitora and his men.

803
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:13,385
You told him I got caught?
You stupid meddler!

804
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:14,986
Hurry!

805
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:10,108
Don't come any closer!

806
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:39,800
Mommy!

807
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:42,237
Children shouldn't play
with swords.

808
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:47,208
Go home to your mother
and live a long life eating gruel.

809
01:44:55,689 --> 01:44:58,658
You're a nice guy.

810
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:06,791
I've got a favor to ask.

811
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:09,200
What?

812
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:23,210
Without my pistol...

813
01:45:26,553 --> 01:45:28,487
I feel sort of naked.

814
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:35,394
I can't go
to the other world without it.

815
01:45:38,565 --> 01:45:40,032
Please...

816
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:43,526
let me hold it.

817
01:46:11,098 --> 01:46:12,588
Don't worry.

818
01:46:13,633 --> 01:46:15,965
I fired it twice.

819
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:18,938
There's no more bullets.

820
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:26,638
Thanks.

821
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:52,262
I can't.

822
01:46:52,873 --> 01:46:55,034
Everything's going dark.

823
01:46:56,743 --> 01:46:58,142
Damn it!

824
01:47:56,436 --> 01:48:01,305
Who's banging
the prayer drum?

825
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:08,673
I don't need any prayers.

826
01:49:09,943 --> 01:49:11,604
Hey!

827
01:49:12,746 --> 01:49:15,715
Two-Bit! Are you there?

828
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:18,783
I'm here.

829
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:28,591
I'll be waiting for you...

830
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:34,829
at the gates of hell.

831
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:40,199
Look at him.

832
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:45,705
He died as recklessly
as he lived.

833
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:54,379
Hansuke!

834
01:49:56,957 --> 01:49:58,219
What is it?

835
01:49:58,425 --> 01:49:59,983
Go hang yourself.

836
01:50:11,571 --> 01:50:15,735
It'll be quiet in this town now.

837
01:50:18,378 --> 01:50:19,777
Old man.

838
01:50:31,257 --> 01:50:32,656
See ya around.

839
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:47,037
THE END
