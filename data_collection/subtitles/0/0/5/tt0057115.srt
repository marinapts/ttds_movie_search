1
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,500
Go inside.

2
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,798
Hurry up.

3
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,898
This way.

4
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,696
Hurry up.

5
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:22,692
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?

6
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,991
- I...
- No, that's mine.

7
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,390
Allez hup!

8
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,980
How far are the trees, Danny?

9
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,579
Over 200 feet.

10
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,478
Yeah, I'd say 300.

11
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:13,778
Long ways to dig.

12
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,877
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.

13
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,976
Willie, you think X got away?

14
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:23,275
He'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

15
00:06:23,475 --> 00:06:26,474
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

16
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,969
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

17
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:49,268
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

18
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,167
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

19
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:06,363
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

20
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:09,263
Good morning, Group Captain.

21
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:14,961
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer,

22
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:19,160
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

23
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,359
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of...

24
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,558
the word is "policy"?

25
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:26,958
Yes.

26
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:29,057
Thank you.

27
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,653
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

28
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:48,452
I am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.

29
00:07:57,549 --> 00:08:00,748
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years

30
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,148
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

31
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,147
energy, manpower and equipment

32
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:10,046
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers.

33
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:13,245
At least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

34
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:18,444
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.

35
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:22,742
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

36
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,342
If they can't, it is their duty
to cause the enemy

37
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,241
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them

38
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,240
and their sworn duty to harass
the enemy to the best of their ability.

39
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,439
Yes, I know.

40
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:38,338
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

41
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:41,337
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

42
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:45,336
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

43
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:49,335
Archibald "Archie" Ives:
11 escape attempts.

44
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:52,734
Even tried to jump
out of the truck coming here.

45
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:54,934
Dickes, William.

46
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,233
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

47
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,732
Flight Lieutenant Willinski: four escapes.

48
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,431
MacDonald: nine.
Hendley, the American: five.

49
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:07,530
Haynes: four. Sedgwick: seven.
The list is almost endless.

50
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,529
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

51
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:14,128
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.

52
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,228
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

53
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,427
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

54
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:26,125
No.

55
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,524
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

56
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:34,023
This is a new camp.

57
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:37,822
It has been built
to hold you and your men.

58
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:42,521
It is organised to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

59
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:46,920
And in me, you will not be
dealing with a common jailer,

60
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,219
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

61
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,418
by the Luftwaffe high command.

62
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:58,416
We have in effect put
all our rotten eggs in one basket,

63
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:01,815
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

64
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,115
Very wise.

65
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:11,213
You will not be denied the usual facilities.

66
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:15,712
Sports, a library, a recreation hall,

67
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:19,711
and for gardening we will give you tools.

68
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,710
We trust you to use them for gardening.

69
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,809
Devote your energies to these things.

70
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,508
Give up your hopeless
attempts to escape.

71
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:31,907
And, with intelligent cooperation,

72
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:35,206
we may all sit out the war

73
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:39,405
as comfortably as possible.

74
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,900
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

75
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,299
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

76
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:05,898
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

77
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,797
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

78
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:12,796
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

79
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:16,595
- In 181 2 they burned your capital.
- That's propaganda.

80
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:19,694
It's in the history books. I read it.

81
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:23,093
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

82
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:25,293
Yeah. No tools.

83
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,391
Hey, Virgil.

84
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,190
Hey, did you see the cooler?

85
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,189
Boy, is it ever a big one!

86
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:39,589
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

87
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,088
Those two guys who were with us in
the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.

88
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:47,487
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.

89
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:51,286
What were their names?
It was Jackson and...

90
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:53,585
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

91
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:56,784
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

92
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:23,677
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

93
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,676
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

94
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:29,775
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

95
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,374
Willie, cigarettes.

96
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:58,267
Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

97
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,267
Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?

98
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,866
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

99
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,065
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

100
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:11,764
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!

101
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:13,963
Are you pushing me?

102
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:16,063
That's mine, you son of a...

103
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:48,754
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

104
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,353
It's all right, mate. We're just
having a friendly little argument.

105
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:55,352
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

106
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,251
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:13:57,451 --> 00:13:59,351
You, too!

108
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,850
Get away! Get back in your huts!

109
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:06,649
Go on!

110
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,439
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only
one other American in the whole camp.

111
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,138
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

112
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:47,937
Hey, you got something goin' already?

113
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,437
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

114
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:54,536
- There's a blind spot through the middle.
- A blind spot?

115
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:57,535
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

116
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:00,734
They'd never see me, especially at night.

117
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:04,733
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

118
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:24,627
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

119
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,726
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

120
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:33,425
I think I'll take a little walk.

121
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:18,113
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.

122
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:20,212
Let me have it, mate.

123
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,009
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

124
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,509
I love you? What bloody good is that?

125
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,408
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

126
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:03,101
Out. Out!

127
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,299
- Your friend, yes?
- Huh?

128
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:11,798
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

129
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,898
Get out, Sedgwick.

130
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,887
Hold it, hold it!

131
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:58,885
- Your name?
- Ives.

132
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,585
Ives.

133
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:05,684
Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.

134
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,383
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

135
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,882
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

136
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,474
I will not take action against you now.

137
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:44,473
This is the first day here and there has
been much stupidity and carelessness...

138
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:46,772
on both sides.

139
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,367
Hey! Get out!

140
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,165
Don't shoot!

141
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,364
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

142
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,263
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

143
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:24,062
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

144
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:27,761
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

145
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:30,760
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.

146
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,759
- Gettin' my baseball.
- Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!

147
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,858
- OK.
- You stay there!

148
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:41,258
Out of the way. Out.

149
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:47,856
What are you doing
over here by the wire?

150
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,355
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...

151
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:05,751
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

152
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:10,350
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire, because I wanna get out.

153
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,147
Do you speak German?

154
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:23,046
Wire cutters.

155
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:28,945
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war.

156
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:32,344
And I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

157
00:20:38,542 --> 00:20:41,641
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

158
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,740
Captain Hilts, actually.

159
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,740
- 17 escape attempts.
- 18, sir.

160
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,839
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

161
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:53,238
I suppose what's called
in the American army a "hotshot pilot".

162
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:55,837
Unfortunately,
you were shot down anyway.

163
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,736
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

164
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,336
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

165
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:09,134
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.

166
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:12,233
I plan on doing so before the war's over.

167
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,832
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

168
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:18,731
About 99 per cent.

169
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:22,130
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

170
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,929
10 days isolation, Hilts.

171
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:27,729
- Captain Hilts.
- 20 days.

172
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:29,228
Right.

173
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:33,827
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

174
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,226
Cooler.

175
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:46,723
- Name?
- Ives.

176
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:48,723
Flying Officer Ives.

177
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,822
Cooler. 20 days.

178
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:56,321
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

179
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:37,493
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

180
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:40,792
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

181
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:42,992
No, I was in college.

182
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:45,991
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?

183
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:50,190
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

184
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:55,488
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

185
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:59,787
How tall are you, Ives?

186
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:01,787
Five feet four. Why?

187
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:04,586
Oh, just wondering.

188
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:09,584
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

189
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,183
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

190
00:24:13,383 --> 00:24:14,383
Bicycles?

191
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:20,281
Motorcycles. Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

192
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:24,080
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.

193
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,080
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

194
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,679
No, horse racing. Jockey.

195
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:33,778
Jockey.

196
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:37,977
Jockey.

197
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,775
Hilts?

198
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:47,074
Are you there, Hilts?

199
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:50,473
Yeah, I'm here.

200
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,272
Don't you have them in the States?
Jockeys?

201
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:56,072
Sure.

202
00:24:56,272 --> 00:25:01,670
They were the days. Saturday nights
in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

203
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,769
You had to fight off the birds.

204
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:06,869
You know, birds.

205
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:08,968
Girls, man. Girls.

206
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:11,967
Do you not have them in the States?

207
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:16,366
Hilts?

208
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:18,466
Are you there, Hilts?

209
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:20,965
Ives.

210
00:25:23,864 --> 00:25:25,664
What?

211
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:30,362
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we got here in the compound?

212
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,561
How many feet do you think
you could get through in eight hours?

213
00:25:33,761 --> 00:25:38,060
I could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

214
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,959
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

215
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,558
and getting the dirt out -
that's what you've to worry about.

216
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:48,657
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

217
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:51,057
How are you going to get the dirt out?

218
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:55,056
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

219
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,255
Aye.

220
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:02,554
Well, what do you think?

221
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:06,153
I must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

222
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:08,152
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

223
00:26:08,452 --> 00:26:11,951
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

224
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:31,146
Eric.

225
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:35,445
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

226
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:38,344
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

227
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:42,743
He has arrived.

228
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:54,539
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

229
00:27:04,637 --> 00:27:06,436
I suggest this prisoner be kept

230
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:10,035
under the strictest
security confinement permanently.

231
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:13,934
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

232
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,433
We have reason to believe
he is the leader

233
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:19,533
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

234
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:24,631
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

235
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,230
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

236
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,329
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

237
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:37,028
Air-force officer prisoners are
the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

238
00:27:37,228 --> 00:27:39,027
not the SS,

239
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,726
or the Gestapo.

240
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:45,526
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

241
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:49,225
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

242
00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:52,124
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

243
00:27:52,424 --> 00:27:55,423
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

244
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:59,422
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

245
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:06,120
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

246
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,219
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

247
00:28:25,915 --> 00:28:27,814
Herr Kuhn.

248
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:11,902
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

249
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,301
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?

250
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,401
Well, it's new.

251
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,400
Here. Let's find you a bed.

252
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,499
Thanks.

253
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,594
Come in.

254
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:44,193
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

255
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:48,792
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

256
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:51,791
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

257
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,390
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

258
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,889
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

259
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:02,888
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

260
00:30:03,188 --> 00:30:05,587
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

261
00:30:06,887 --> 00:30:08,786
You met the commandant?

262
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:11,786
Yes, I did.

263
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:14,985
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

264
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:17,784
They wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

265
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,783
Who else is here? Cavendish?

266
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:22,683
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

267
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:24,782
- Blythe?
- Yes.

268
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:28,081
Almost the whole X organisation.

269
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:33,080
Almost. They cleaned out all the other
camps and dumped us in this one.

270
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,779
As Von Luger put it:
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."

271
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:40,178
There's madness in their method.

272
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:42,677
What about Tommy Bristol?

273
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,177
No, but there's an American - Hendley.

274
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:48,676
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?

275
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:52,375
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

276
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:56,873
Last of the tea until
the Red Cross gets through again.

277
00:30:57,073 --> 00:30:59,273
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

278
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,470
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

279
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,470
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

280
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:15,968
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

281
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:18,467
Too many lives are at stake.

282
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:24,666
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

283
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:28,865
You appointed me Big X,
and it's my duty to harass,

284
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:31,764
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

285
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:35,063
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

286
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:40,661
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

287
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:44,860
that thousands of troops'll be
tied up here looking after us.

288
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,460
How?

289
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,559
By putting more men out of this

290
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,558
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

291
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:57,457
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

292
00:31:57,757 --> 00:32:00,056
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

293
00:32:00,356 --> 00:32:04,755
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany here. You said so yourself.

294
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:07,654
Have you thought of what it might cost?

295
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:14,352
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

296
00:32:14,652 --> 00:32:16,852
knuckle under and crawl.

297
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:20,051
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

298
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:22,950
I have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

299
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,149
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

300
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:29,248
the high command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

301
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,448
not the Gestapo and the SS.

302
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:37,346
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command of the Luftwaffe,

303
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:39,046
then the SS and the Gestapo.

304
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:43,044
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

305
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:45,244
There's only one way to put it, sir.

306
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:48,943
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

307
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:52,042
If they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

308
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:54,941
I have no argument with you, Roger.

309
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:58,940
As senior officer, I'm merely
pointing out a pertinent fact.

310
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:04,938
When are you calling a meeting, X?

311
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:15,036
Tonight.

312
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:32,331
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the
immortal words of our new commandant.

313
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:35,030
"Devote your energies
to things other than escape

314
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,430
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible."

315
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:42,928
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

316
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:46,227
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

317
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,226
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

318
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:52,326
In fact, we're going to
put the goons to sleep.

319
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:55,925
Meanwhile, we dig.

320
00:33:57,624 --> 00:34:00,523
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

321
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:03,922
shows us that huts 104 and 5
are closest to the woods.

322
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:06,322
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

323
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:09,521
directly east
under the cooler and the wire.

324
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:11,820
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

325
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,819
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

326
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:18,518
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.

327
00:34:18,818 --> 00:34:22,617
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

328
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:26,116
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

329
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:29,515
All right, Roger,
but did you say the first tunnel?

330
00:34:29,815 --> 00:34:32,615
I did. There'll be three.

331
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:38,013
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

332
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:43,212
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and
Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

333
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:48,110
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

334
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,009
How many men do you
plan to take out, Roger?

335
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:53,409
250.

336
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:59,407
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.

337
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:02,806
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

338
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:05,406
- 250?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

339
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,505
Yes, but...

340
00:35:09,305 --> 00:35:10,804
OK, Roger.

341
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:15,503
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

342
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:18,002
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

343
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,900
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.

344
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,999
We're going to tunnel.

345
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,398
Splendid.

346
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:38,197
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

347
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:41,596
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

348
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:46,494
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac,
of course, will take care of intelligence.

349
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:49,094
Hendley. We haven't met.

350
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:51,193
- Scrounger?
- Right.

351
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:54,592
Dennis, maps and surveys.

352
00:35:54,892 --> 00:35:59,191
Colin, you'll take your usual job. Eric,
how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

353
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:04,290
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated
three tunnels, but we'll manage.

354
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:07,789
Roger, who's going to handle
security for all this?

355
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:12,087
You are. I want a system of stooges
covering this compound

356
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:16,086
from front to back,
checking every goon in and out.

357
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:20,485
I want a signal system so perfect
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet

358
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:25,084
of any of the huts in which we're working,
we can shut down without a sign.

359
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:29,983
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

360
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:34,981
I'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit, and we'll pound out the details.

361
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,580
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

362
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,979
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

363
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,872
Oh, hello.

364
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:11,571
My name's Blythe.

365
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:13,971
Hendley.

366
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,369
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

367
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:24,268
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

368
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:27,967
Oh, a bird watcher?

369
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:31,866
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

370
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:37,164
I suppose you have
bird watchers in the States?

371
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:39,464
Yes, we have some.

372
00:37:40,863 --> 00:37:42,163
Tea?

373
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,762
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

374
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:49,461
Where's your kit?

375
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:53,760
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

376
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,958
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

377
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,157
Such as.

378
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,756
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

379
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:10,555
I'll need a camera.

380
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:14,254
- What kind?
- A good one.

381
00:38:14,454 --> 00:38:19,553
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

382
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:23,752
All right.

383
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:26,151
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

384
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,549
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.

385
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:34,149
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

386
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:41,047
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

387
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:45,146
I must have used these
wretched leaves about 20 times.

388
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:47,845
It's not that I mind so much.

389
00:38:48,045 --> 00:38:50,644
Tea without milk is so uncivilised.

390
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:53,443
Yeah.

391
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:55,343
I'll get our wood.

392
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,040
Close up! Close up!

393
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:15,138
Close up!

394
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,237
Close up!

395
00:39:18,437 --> 00:39:19,636
Close up!

396
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:22,735
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!

397
00:39:47,729 --> 00:39:49,628
Splendid.

398
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,924
Blythe, what are you doing here?

399
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:09,523
I'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance lnterpretation.

400
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:13,522
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

401
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:18,420
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.

402
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,519
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

403
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:27,818
I'm the forger.

404
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:50,412
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

405
00:40:50,711 --> 00:40:51,911
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 1 10.

406
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:55,710
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

407
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,010
109? Right.

408
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:02,508
I'll work in 107. For now, Danny, Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

409
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:06,907
I want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

410
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:10,306
We will need timber for the shafts
and the entrance chambers.

411
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:13,205
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

412
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:16,904
We can tear up 1 5 and move the men
around so the goons won't miss them.

413
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:19,104
The rest will come
from strips off the wall.

414
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:22,203
- Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

415
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:25,202
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

416
00:41:43,297 --> 00:41:45,697
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

417
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:49,096
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

418
00:41:50,495 --> 00:41:51,595
Get away!

419
00:41:52,695 --> 00:41:55,594
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

420
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:58,393
Stop this nonsense!

421
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:02,692
Get away!

422
00:42:02,992 --> 00:42:04,491
Turn the water off!

423
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:05,591
Somewhere!

424
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:50,679
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.

425
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:55,078
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.

426
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:58,477
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 1 1 3's washroom.

427
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,476
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

428
00:43:09,574 --> 00:43:12,273
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

429
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:15,672
Not when you're organised, Mac.

430
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:22,570
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

431
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,569
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

432
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,167
Good luck to us, Danny.

433
00:43:53,162 --> 00:43:55,361
Why 17?

434
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:58,460
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

435
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:32,251
All right?

436
00:44:47,347 --> 00:44:49,246
It's good.

437
00:44:58,244 --> 00:45:00,044
It's very good.

438
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,333
Get out! Get out!

439
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:07,425
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

440
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:08,525
Mopping up.

441
00:46:13,024 --> 00:46:15,823
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

442
00:46:20,122 --> 00:46:22,721
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

443
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,719
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

444
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:23,504
No. I vote no. Look, we've put
the goons to sleep exactly like you said.

445
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:28,003
But just one little thing like this
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

446
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,502
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

447
00:47:31,902 --> 00:47:34,501
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

448
00:47:34,801 --> 00:47:37,201
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

449
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:40,900
I understand you two
are contemplating a blitz-out.

450
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,299
Where'd you hear that... sir?

451
00:47:43,399 --> 00:47:47,098
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

452
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:50,097
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.

453
00:47:50,397 --> 00:47:52,596
Why? It's only a two-man job.

454
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:56,395
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

455
00:47:56,695 --> 00:47:58,995
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

456
00:47:59,195 --> 00:48:01,594
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

457
00:48:01,794 --> 00:48:06,793
It's just that... well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

458
00:48:07,592 --> 00:48:10,692
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire - a blind spot.

459
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:14,391
Then we dig down, take the dirt,
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

460
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,290
and then straight out.

461
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:20,289
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs
in front, pushes the dirt behind him.

462
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:24,188
I stash it behind me, then we burrow
through the dirt like a couple of moles.

463
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:29,187
By dawn we're under the wire, across
the open space, into the woods and gone.

464
00:48:35,785 --> 00:48:36,884
Well...

465
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,183
When do you intend to try this?

466
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:44,982
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

467
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:50,381
Hilts, this may not be quite
the right time for this sort of thing.

468
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:53,880
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

469
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,279
bloody close to being wire-happy.

470
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:59,378
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

471
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:02,477
It'll work. I know it will.

472
00:49:10,575 --> 00:49:11,975
Good luck.

473
00:49:12,175 --> 00:49:14,074
Thank you.

474
00:49:15,974 --> 00:49:20,073
- Hilts, um... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

475
00:49:20,373 --> 00:49:22,872
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

476
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:24,971
Good night, sir.

477
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:33,669
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

478
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:37,268
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

479
00:49:37,468 --> 00:49:40,367
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

480
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:42,866
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

481
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:44,966
If we stop all the breakouts,

482
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:48,665
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling.

483
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:54,363
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going
to be in the cooler for an awful long time.

484
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:43,150
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

485
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:53,347
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

486
00:50:59,745 --> 00:51:02,845
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

487
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:06,044
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

488
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:09,743
It's the first place the ferrets would look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.

489
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:12,242
Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.

490
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:16,241
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

491
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,740
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

492
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,939
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

493
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:27,738
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

494
00:51:27,938 --> 00:51:31,037
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

495
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:33,936
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

496
00:51:35,236 --> 00:51:37,535
Didn't they teach you
promptness in the RN?

497
00:51:37,735 --> 00:51:40,634
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

498
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:44,933
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

499
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,133
Well, of course.

500
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:49,732
Would you mind?

501
00:51:59,629 --> 00:52:01,529
Now...

502
00:52:03,228 --> 00:52:06,727
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

503
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:10,126
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

504
00:52:10,426 --> 00:52:12,626
you wander out into the compound

505
00:52:12,826 --> 00:52:16,724
where you pull these
strings in your pockets.

506
00:52:17,824 --> 00:52:20,024
Out come the pins.

507
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:27,722
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.

508
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:30,621
Unless you're a fool,
the ferrets won't see a thing.

509
00:52:30,821 --> 00:52:33,720
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

510
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,019
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

511
00:52:39,918 --> 00:52:42,417
Mac, this is what we'll do.

512
00:52:57,313 --> 00:53:00,313
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

513
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,010
Nice garden you've got, sir.

514
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:46,100
All right. Let's look sharp.

515
00:53:53,498 --> 00:53:54,398
That looks sharp.

516
00:53:58,997 --> 00:54:00,496
Sir.

517
00:54:03,995 --> 00:54:07,994
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

518
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,789
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

519
00:54:26,089 --> 00:54:29,988
I am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.

520
00:54:30,288 --> 00:54:32,188
We'll manage, sir.

521
00:54:41,685 --> 00:54:45,784
I must say I am surprised with
the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

522
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:49,783
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

523
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:55,481
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants
to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.

524
00:54:55,981 --> 00:54:57,981
The English are keen on gardening.

525
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,079
Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

526
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:05,279
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

527
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:09,377
Good point.

528
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,572
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

529
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:32,871
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

530
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:35,570
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

531
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:49,367
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

532
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:52,766
Here we are. Now, let's see.

533
00:55:52,966 --> 00:55:55,365
Biscuits, two packets.

534
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,764
Coffee, two tins.

535
00:55:57,964 --> 00:56:00,164
Bovril, one jar.

536
00:56:00,364 --> 00:56:02,863
Cigarettes, six packets.

537
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:07,262
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

538
00:56:07,562 --> 00:56:09,561
And marmalade, mine.

539
00:56:09,761 --> 00:56:13,960
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

540
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,759
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

541
00:56:20,258 --> 00:56:23,157
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organisation.

542
00:56:23,457 --> 00:56:26,456
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

543
00:56:26,856 --> 00:56:29,556
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.

544
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:31,055
I'll see what I can do.

545
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:34,754
And, of course, any other
identity cards, personal papers,

546
00:56:34,954 --> 00:56:37,054
documents you can put your hands on.

547
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:39,353
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

548
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:41,452
Good luck.

549
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:53,449
O come all ye faithful

550
00:56:53,749 --> 00:56:56,848
Joyful and triumphant

551
00:56:57,048 --> 00:56:58,948
O come ye

552
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:04,546
O come ye to Bethlehem

553
00:57:04,946 --> 00:57:08,145
Come and behold Him

554
00:57:08,545 --> 00:57:11,444
Born the King of Angels

555
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:15,143
O come let us adore Him

556
00:57:15,443 --> 00:57:18,742
O come let us adore Him

557
00:57:18,942 --> 00:57:23,441
O come let us adore Him

558
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,140
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

559
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,240
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

560
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,139
Yes, I know, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open,

561
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:34,738
and this is holding us up very badly.

562
00:57:36,937 --> 00:57:38,737
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

563
00:57:38,937 --> 00:57:41,636
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

564
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:45,135
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

565
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:47,734
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

566
00:57:48,934 --> 00:57:51,933
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

567
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:54,233
Mac.

568
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:56,332
Excellent.

569
00:57:57,332 --> 00:57:59,631
Have it in by tomorrow night.

570
00:58:01,031 --> 00:58:04,030
Christ the Lord

571
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,727
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

572
00:58:16,127 --> 00:58:17,626
Thanks.

573
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:19,925
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

574
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:30,723
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

575
00:58:33,322 --> 00:58:36,321
I'll smoke it later when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

576
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:39,420
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

577
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,319
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.

578
00:58:45,618 --> 00:58:47,018
No, no.

579
00:58:47,218 --> 00:58:50,117
Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

580
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:52,417
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

581
00:58:52,617 --> 00:58:54,616
It was a red sky last night.

582
00:58:54,716 --> 00:58:56,516
I never heard that before.

583
00:58:56,715 --> 00:58:58,915
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

584
00:58:59,215 --> 00:59:01,614
- You were a Boy Scout? So was l.
- Really?

585
00:59:01,814 --> 00:59:04,613
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

586
00:59:05,713 --> 00:59:09,312
I was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting

587
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:13,111
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

588
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:20,309
Werner, you think you'll stay
in the army after the war?

589
00:59:20,609 --> 00:59:23,308
No. I'm not a well man.

590
00:59:23,508 --> 00:59:25,308
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

591
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:28,107
Yes. I could tell you
stories about my teeth

592
00:59:28,307 --> 00:59:30,506
that would make your hair stand on end.

593
00:59:30,706 --> 00:59:33,006
Our dentist here is a butcher.

594
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:37,004
But don't tell anyone I said so.

595
00:59:37,904 --> 00:59:40,204
It's a soldier's right to complain.

596
00:59:40,404 --> 00:59:42,803
Maybe in your army, but here?

597
00:59:43,503 --> 00:59:47,702
One little criticism,
and... to the Russian front.

598
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:51,401
Is that so? Terrible.

599
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,300
That's terrible.

600
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:01,698
Werner.

601
01:00:04,497 --> 01:00:06,596
Why don't we go into my room?

602
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:09,696
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...

603
01:00:12,495 --> 01:00:14,994
I was just gonna make some coffee.

604
01:00:17,693 --> 01:00:19,593
Real coffee.

605
01:00:47,985 --> 01:00:50,584
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

606
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:52,684
Where is it?

607
01:00:58,882 --> 01:01:01,981
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

608
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,979
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

609
01:01:18,377 --> 01:01:20,276
Yeah. Keep it.

610
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,376
Nein. I must go.

611
01:01:23,176 --> 01:01:25,775
It's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.

612
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:28,974
With you in the cooler,
will we be friends? I must report this.

613
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:34,372
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?

614
01:01:34,672 --> 01:01:37,372
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.

615
01:01:37,572 --> 01:01:41,071
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

616
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:43,870
I'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.

617
01:02:16,661 --> 01:02:20,760
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

618
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,359
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman -
the masked shrike.

619
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,958
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.

620
01:02:27,258 --> 01:02:30,557
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

621
01:02:30,957 --> 01:02:34,556
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the colouring.

622
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:38,155
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

623
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:43,554
A black rump, a black crown with a bold
white flash, and a white line over the eye.

624
01:02:43,854 --> 01:02:46,553
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

625
01:02:46,753 --> 01:02:50,652
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

626
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:55,350
The shrike lives in lightly wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

627
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,050
Well, Hendley, have you
taken to birds too now?

628
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,749
Yeah. Stick around.
You might learn something.

629
01:03:01,049 --> 01:03:03,548
I have better things to do than draw birds.

630
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:09,647
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

631
01:03:10,046 --> 01:03:13,346
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

632
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:37,839
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to
cross a frontier. Here's another one.

633
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:40,338
Which one's the forgery?

634
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:43,937
- That one.
- That's right.

635
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,837
They both are.

636
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:49,436
What's holding us up now is
the new form of this travel permit.

637
01:03:49,736 --> 01:03:52,435
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

638
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:56,634
And a military identity card.

639
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:58,933
And a...

640
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:00,733
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.

641
01:04:00,933 --> 01:04:04,732
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.

642
01:04:04,931 --> 01:04:08,830
What appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week.

643
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,830
You get 10 out of 10 for this, old boy.

644
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:15,828
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

645
01:04:17,028 --> 01:04:18,928
It's on loan.

646
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:23,226
In order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

647
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,825
I suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

648
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:30,824
I can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds,

649
01:04:31,024 --> 01:04:33,824
and rather nice lounge suits.

650
01:04:34,024 --> 01:04:36,523
Lapels. I can do quite a lot
of things with those.

651
01:04:36,723 --> 01:04:41,222
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

652
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:45,620
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

653
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,320
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

654
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:54,118
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

655
01:04:56,417 --> 01:05:02,616
And here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

656
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:07,314
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?

657
01:05:07,614 --> 01:05:10,414
The goons'd have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

658
01:05:10,714 --> 01:05:14,812
That's Sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.

659
01:05:15,112 --> 01:05:17,012
This blanket.

660
01:05:17,312 --> 01:05:20,211
Particularly the stripes. Marvellous.

661
01:05:20,411 --> 01:05:21,511
- Coats.
- Yes.

662
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:24,510
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

663
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:27,509
Those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

664
01:05:27,809 --> 01:05:32,408
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

665
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:34,907
Blanket ticking.

666
01:05:35,107 --> 01:05:39,606
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

667
01:05:40,006 --> 01:05:43,305
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

668
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:46,004
Just take a look at this, Roger.

669
01:05:46,304 --> 01:05:51,202
Now, this blanket material, we scrape
this down until it's really smooth,

670
01:05:51,602 --> 01:05:53,702
and then dye it with boot polish.

671
01:05:53,902 --> 01:05:57,701
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

672
01:05:58,101 --> 01:06:00,800
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

673
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,199
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

674
01:06:03,499 --> 01:06:05,998
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."

675
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:09,198
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

676
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:41,189
Good morning, Hilts.

677
01:06:42,888 --> 01:06:45,888
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

678
01:06:46,287 --> 01:06:48,187
- When?
- 17 days. 7th of July.

679
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:50,086
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

680
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:52,686
Is Ives going with you?

681
01:06:52,886 --> 01:06:55,485
Yeah, if he wants to.

682
01:06:55,785 --> 01:06:58,984
You know that Ives is close to cracking?

683
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:02,183
Yeah.

684
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:06,882
- Better for him to go out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

685
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,780
Right.

686
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:19,678
It's possible for one man to get out
through the wire, even get away,

687
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:25,277
but there are in fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself

688
01:07:25,677 --> 01:07:27,876
in this camp who are trying to escape.

689
01:07:28,976 --> 01:07:30,875
I appreciate that.

690
01:07:33,575 --> 01:07:35,374
Something's coming - I can feel it -

691
01:07:35,674 --> 01:07:39,073
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

692
01:07:39,273 --> 01:07:41,472
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

693
01:07:41,672 --> 01:07:43,972
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

694
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:47,871
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

695
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:53,069
Yes, well, as I was saying, Hilts,

696
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:57,268
we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

697
01:07:57,568 --> 01:08:01,567
We have all the information we need
for the escape routes out of Germany.

698
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:03,866
But what we do not have...

699
01:08:04,066 --> 01:08:07,365
Is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

700
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:10,465
We've tried every goon in the camp.
No go.

701
01:08:10,664 --> 01:08:14,263
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

702
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:17,363
We want to know where
we hit the main roads.

703
01:08:17,663 --> 01:08:21,062
Where the police stations are,
where they've got their roadblocks.

704
01:08:21,262 --> 01:08:25,560
And most important of all,
we've got to know how to get from here

705
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,260
to the railway station.

706
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:31,759
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,

707
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:34,658
I'm not gonna be
making maps for you guys.

708
01:08:34,858 --> 01:08:40,256
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

709
01:08:40,556 --> 01:08:43,256
- Understandable.
- Completely.

710
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:48,054
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

711
01:08:51,853 --> 01:08:54,153
Interesting idea.

712
01:08:54,353 --> 01:08:57,452
- How many you taking out?
- 250.

713
01:09:00,251 --> 01:09:02,250
250?

714
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,250
Yeah.

715
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:06,849
You're crazy. You too.

716
01:09:07,049 --> 01:09:10,448
250 guys just walking down the road,
just like that.

717
01:09:10,748 --> 01:09:14,447
Well, some on the road, some by train,
some cross-country.

718
01:09:14,747 --> 01:09:16,946
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

719
01:09:17,146 --> 01:09:18,946
maps, compasses, rations.

720
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:21,945
You're gonna alert
every goon in the country.

721
01:09:22,145 --> 01:09:25,144
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

722
01:09:25,444 --> 01:09:30,243
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

723
01:09:33,242 --> 01:09:35,041
Yes, well, thanks, anyway.

724
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:38,341
- If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.

725
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,440
Any time.

726
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:47,038
Wait a minute. You aren't seriously
suggesting that if I get through the wire

727
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:50,337
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

728
01:09:50,537 --> 01:09:53,237
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler

729
01:09:53,536 --> 01:09:55,836
so you can get the information you need?

730
01:09:56,036 --> 01:10:00,535
Yes. One has to ask some very
strange things in the job I have.

731
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:03,834
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.

732
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:05,933
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.

733
01:10:06,033 --> 01:10:08,832
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.

734
01:10:11,532 --> 01:10:13,431
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

735
01:10:20,829 --> 01:10:22,728
Check.

736
01:10:25,828 --> 01:10:27,527
Herr Hendley, l...

737
01:10:27,727 --> 01:10:30,026
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

738
01:10:33,126 --> 01:10:36,825
- What's the matter, Werner?
- My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

739
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:40,224
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

740
01:10:41,223 --> 01:10:43,123
He lost his wallet.

741
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:46,622
Do you realise what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

742
01:10:46,822 --> 01:10:48,821
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

743
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,620
I've looked every place, every place.

744
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:59,019
I must have lost them while I was in here.

745
01:10:59,219 --> 01:11:01,518
- No.
- Yes.

746
01:11:01,818 --> 01:11:05,417
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

747
01:11:05,717 --> 01:11:08,016
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

748
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,115
Werner.

749
01:11:11,315 --> 01:11:14,314
Not now. It might look a little peculiar

750
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:17,913
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

751
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:24,112
Look, I'll find them. I promise you I'll
find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.

752
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,509
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

753
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:35,109
- Werner.
- Yes?

754
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:37,608
There is one small favour.

755
01:11:38,008 --> 01:11:40,307
A camera.

756
01:11:41,807 --> 01:11:45,106
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

757
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:50,505
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

758
01:11:50,904 --> 01:11:52,804
Focal-plane shutter.

759
01:11:54,503 --> 01:11:57,903
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

760
01:11:59,302 --> 01:12:01,102
Let me know when you got it.

761
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:10,399
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner, but I like him.

762
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:12,599
Checkmate.

763
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:38,891
How soon's our air pump
going to be ready?

764
01:12:39,191 --> 01:12:42,390
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

765
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,890
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

766
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:47,589
- No good?
- Today, three times.

767
01:13:05,384 --> 01:13:06,684
Willie, you all right?

768
01:13:06,784 --> 01:13:08,683
Pull!

769
01:13:37,575 --> 01:13:42,374
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger. All 335 feet of it.

770
01:13:42,674 --> 01:13:44,573
Four times today.

771
01:13:45,773 --> 01:13:49,472
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

772
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:53,871
It's a lot of timber, Roger. Can you get it?

773
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,769
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

774
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:04,568
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

775
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:06,667
OK, Willie.

776
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:10,566
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

777
01:14:10,866 --> 01:14:13,266
A partridge in a pear tree

778
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:16,765
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

779
01:14:17,065 --> 01:14:20,364
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

780
01:14:21,064 --> 01:14:24,063
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

781
01:14:24,263 --> 01:14:26,462
Four calling birds, three French hens

782
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:30,361
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

783
01:14:30,661 --> 01:14:33,960
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

784
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,059
Five gold rings

785
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:42,358
- How's it going with the rafters up there?
- Taking out one in four.

786
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:49,456
Stay with it.

787
01:14:49,556 --> 01:14:52,555
Five gold rings

788
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:54,754
Four calling birds, three French hens

789
01:14:54,954 --> 01:14:58,553
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

790
01:14:58,753 --> 01:15:02,052
On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

791
01:15:02,352 --> 01:15:04,852
Seven swans a-swimming,
six geese a-laying

792
01:15:05,052 --> 01:15:08,051
Five gold rings

793
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:10,250
Four calling birds, three French hens

794
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:14,549
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

795
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:30,844
Five gold rings, four calling birds...

796
01:15:31,244 --> 01:15:34,444
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

797
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:35,643
Say, Cavendish...

798
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:37,743
Three French hens, two turtle doves

799
01:15:37,943 --> 01:15:39,842
And a partridge in a pear...

800
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:41,941
Allez hup!

801
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,439
Never mind.

802
01:16:00,536 --> 01:16:03,136
Here's a present from our friend Werner.

803
01:16:03,436 --> 01:16:04,935
Splendid.

804
01:16:05,135 --> 01:16:07,035
Simply splendid.

805
01:16:08,234 --> 01:16:10,334
This should do very nicely.

806
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:15,732
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

807
01:16:15,932 --> 01:16:19,931
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

808
01:17:28,113 --> 01:17:32,211
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

809
01:17:32,511 --> 01:17:36,610
- Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?

810
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:38,910
We make it 50 feet, sir.

811
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:42,309
- Dark of the moon is the 7th...
- 8th and 9th.

812
01:17:42,509 --> 01:17:44,408
A day earlier in August.

813
01:17:50,706 --> 01:17:52,506
Morning.

814
01:17:53,706 --> 01:17:55,705
There he goes again.

815
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:58,304
Why is he buying up all
the potatoes in the camp?

816
01:17:58,604 --> 01:18:01,303
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

817
01:18:01,503 --> 01:18:03,903
Hilts and Hendley
lock themselves in every night.

818
01:18:04,203 --> 01:18:07,302
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

819
01:18:07,702 --> 01:18:11,501
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

820
01:18:11,701 --> 01:18:14,400
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press on into the trees.

821
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,099
Right, Roger.

822
01:19:04,186 --> 01:19:05,586
Wow.

823
01:19:07,685 --> 01:19:09,185
Wow.

824
01:19:11,284 --> 01:19:12,684
Wow.

825
01:19:39,177 --> 01:19:40,776
Wow.

826
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:48,874
Wow.

827
01:19:57,672 --> 01:19:58,971
Wow.

828
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:50,757
About face!

829
01:20:52,957 --> 01:20:54,856
Forward march!

830
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:05,853
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.

831
01:21:06,053 --> 01:21:07,953
It's the 4th of July.

832
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,349
What the devil's this?

833
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,447
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.

834
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:31,246
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.

835
01:21:31,546 --> 01:21:33,946
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

836
01:21:34,245 --> 01:21:36,245
And to getting home.

837
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:37,944
Very well. We accept.

838
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:39,844
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

839
01:21:40,044 --> 01:21:41,443
Gentlemen, follow us.

840
01:21:41,643 --> 01:21:43,543
About face!

841
01:22:03,338 --> 01:22:05,237
Company, halt!

842
01:22:09,236 --> 01:22:11,535
All right, let's line up down here!

843
01:22:12,835 --> 01:22:15,034
All right, grab a cup!

844
01:22:15,334 --> 01:22:17,134
Line it up! Here we go.

845
01:22:24,332 --> 01:22:26,831
That explains what happened
to the potatoes.

846
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:29,930
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

847
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:32,929
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

848
01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:36,928
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you
can feel it throughout the whole camp.

849
01:22:37,228 --> 01:22:40,028
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

850
01:22:40,227 --> 01:22:42,427
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

851
01:22:42,627 --> 01:22:45,726
Moonshine.
American moonshine. Moonshine.

852
01:22:45,926 --> 01:22:48,425
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

853
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:50,825
Keep it moving.

854
01:22:51,025 --> 01:22:53,124
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

855
01:22:53,424 --> 01:22:55,623
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

856
01:22:56,023 --> 01:22:59,022
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...

857
01:22:59,922 --> 01:23:02,921
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!

858
01:23:04,121 --> 01:23:07,020
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

859
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,320
Keep it moving.

860
01:23:09,619 --> 01:23:11,519
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

861
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:15,018
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

862
01:23:15,218 --> 01:23:18,117
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

863
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:35,212
Get good and stoned, my friend.

864
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:39,911
Keep it going. Keep it...

865
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:44,010
No taxation without representation.

866
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:46,709
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

867
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:50,508
Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.

868
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:53,008
Well, let's drink to Tom.

869
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:55,107
To Tom.

870
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:06,204
In the three years, seven months
and two weeks that I've been in the bag,

871
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:09,303
that's the most extraordinary
stuff I've ever tasted.

872
01:24:09,603 --> 01:24:12,802
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.

873
01:24:15,701 --> 01:24:19,100
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.

874
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,600
Call on Ives.

875
01:24:32,297 --> 01:24:34,096
Cheers, Hendley!

876
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:44,294
You know what that is?

877
01:24:44,494 --> 01:24:46,593
I'll tell you what it isn't.

878
01:24:46,893 --> 01:24:49,092
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

879
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:52,691
How do you like it, sir?

880
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:55,591
Well, it's...

881
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,690
To the colonies.

882
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:59,789
Independence.

883
01:25:05,488 --> 01:25:09,687
How are you managing over there without
us? Getting along all right, are you?

884
01:25:10,087 --> 01:25:12,986
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir... sir.

885
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:23,583
Yes, well, it's...

886
01:25:24,983 --> 01:25:26,882
It's good stuff, Hilts.

887
01:25:29,181 --> 01:25:31,081
Thank you, sir.

888
01:25:51,575 --> 01:25:53,375
Danny! Here's to...

889
01:26:00,973 --> 01:26:03,472
Roger, goons in 105.

890
01:26:04,272 --> 01:26:06,271
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

891
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:14,269
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons'll know the hut's important.

892
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:17,468
Here's to going home.

893
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:35,663
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

894
01:26:35,863 --> 01:26:37,763
Home!

895
01:26:50,459 --> 01:26:54,258
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?

896
01:26:57,057 --> 01:27:00,856
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.

897
01:27:01,056 --> 01:27:05,655
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realise that myself.

898
01:27:05,955 --> 01:27:08,754
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

899
01:27:09,154 --> 01:27:11,054
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

900
01:27:58,441 --> 01:28:00,340
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

901
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,340
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

902
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:43,328
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.

903
01:28:57,525 --> 01:28:59,424
It's the tunnel.

904
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:18,219
Success.

905
01:29:42,212 --> 01:29:43,512
Ives!

906
01:30:54,693 --> 01:30:58,492
Sir, let me know
the exact information you need.

907
01:30:59,891 --> 01:31:02,091
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

908
01:31:04,690 --> 01:31:06,689
Open up Harry.

909
01:31:06,789 --> 01:31:09,289
We dig. Around the clock.

910
01:32:44,463 --> 01:32:46,662
- Cooler.
- Right.

911
01:32:50,161 --> 01:32:52,860
Well, I didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

912
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:56,859
He wasn't caught.

913
01:33:10,556 --> 01:33:12,655
Hilts, welcome home.

914
01:34:05,841 --> 01:34:06,840
Danny?

915
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:11,039
Danny?

916
01:34:14,138 --> 01:34:15,938
Danny?

917
01:34:22,536 --> 01:34:24,435
Are you all right, Danny?

918
01:34:26,435 --> 01:34:28,234
Yes.

919
01:34:28,434 --> 01:34:30,234
All right.

920
01:34:32,533 --> 01:34:35,432
All right. Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

921
01:34:38,132 --> 01:34:40,531
For God's sake,
you've left out a whole eagle.

922
01:34:40,731 --> 01:34:42,631
That's impossible.

923
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:45,830
Yes.

924
01:34:46,629 --> 01:34:49,429
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

925
01:34:50,728 --> 01:34:52,828
I'm sorry, Colin.

926
01:34:53,028 --> 01:34:54,927
It's all right, Smithy.

927
01:34:56,027 --> 01:34:59,826
It's getting late.
You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

928
01:35:00,026 --> 01:35:01,825
All right.

929
01:35:02,025 --> 01:35:04,625
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.

930
01:35:45,014 --> 01:35:47,213
I can't see a bloody thing.

931
01:36:15,405 --> 01:36:19,204
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

932
01:36:19,604 --> 01:36:23,803
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

933
01:36:24,103 --> 01:36:26,702
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.

934
01:36:40,398 --> 01:36:44,197
One, two, three, four, five.

935
01:37:03,692 --> 01:37:04,692
Roger.

936
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:11,290
No, it's me.

937
01:37:13,689 --> 01:37:15,589
How do you like the old escape suit?

938
01:37:15,889 --> 01:37:17,688
Fine, fine.

939
01:37:20,188 --> 01:37:22,087
Colin.

940
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:26,686
How do you like mine?

941
01:37:26,886 --> 01:37:29,085
It looks splendid.

942
01:37:55,678 --> 01:37:57,877
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

943
01:37:58,077 --> 01:38:02,076
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

944
01:38:03,876 --> 01:38:07,275
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

945
01:38:07,575 --> 01:38:10,274
Please, Willie, let me alone.

946
01:38:10,574 --> 01:38:12,973
I can't go in that tunnel any more.

947
01:38:13,173 --> 01:38:15,473
So I'm going out through the wire.

948
01:38:19,072 --> 01:38:22,671
Danny, think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

949
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:25,870
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

950
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:28,369
- I go out now.
- No.

951
01:38:29,569 --> 01:38:32,768
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

952
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:41,965
Don't do that.

953
01:38:44,365 --> 01:38:46,164
Willie...

954
01:38:47,964 --> 01:38:50,063
Since I was a boy,

955
01:38:50,263 --> 01:38:54,462
I hate and feared little rooms,

956
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:56,861
closets, caves.

957
01:38:57,161 --> 01:38:59,461
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.

958
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:01,860
Because I must get out.

959
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:05,059
I hide the fear, and I dig.

960
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:10,158
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men,

961
01:39:10,358 --> 01:39:12,857
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head

962
01:39:13,157 --> 01:39:15,956
and ruin the escape for everybody.

963
01:39:18,755 --> 01:39:20,655
So I go now.

964
01:39:25,553 --> 01:39:28,353
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

965
01:39:29,952 --> 01:39:33,451
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

966
01:39:34,951 --> 01:39:36,750
All right.

967
01:39:45,148 --> 01:39:46,948
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

968
01:39:47,947 --> 01:39:50,247
Well, how do you think we look?

969
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:55,745
It's as bad as all that?

970
01:39:55,945 --> 01:40:02,243
Colin, I want first of all to say that without
you, we would not have been ready.

971
01:40:02,643 --> 01:40:06,142
That's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

972
01:40:08,042 --> 01:40:09,941
What's the matter, Roger?

973
01:40:11,241 --> 01:40:13,440
You can't go.

974
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,440
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

975
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:17,139
Why?

976
01:40:17,239 --> 01:40:19,939
You can't see your hand
in front of your face.

977
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,638
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.

978
01:40:22,938 --> 01:40:24,737
That's ridiculous.

979
01:40:26,037 --> 01:40:29,236
That's ridiculous. Never heard
anything so absurd in my life.

980
01:40:29,436 --> 01:40:32,635
I can see perfectly. I can see perfectly!

981
01:40:33,535 --> 01:40:36,934
I can see... that pin down there.

982
01:40:37,134 --> 01:40:39,733
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

983
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:54,729
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?

984
01:40:56,129 --> 01:40:57,428
Yes, of course.

985
01:40:59,628 --> 01:41:02,527
Put the pin down there, will you?

986
01:41:02,827 --> 01:41:04,227
All right.

987
01:41:08,725 --> 01:41:10,125
All right. Come on.

988
01:41:11,025 --> 01:41:12,924
Come on. Sit down.

989
01:41:14,724 --> 01:41:17,123
Sit down. It was a good try.

990
01:41:18,423 --> 01:41:22,322
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

991
01:41:22,622 --> 01:41:26,021
- It's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

992
01:41:26,221 --> 01:41:28,520
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

993
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:34,018
We all know the score here.
Well, at least, most of us do.

994
01:41:34,418 --> 01:41:37,417
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

995
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:41,816
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.

996
01:41:42,116 --> 01:41:46,415
But once we get past that wire and have
them looking all over Germany for us,

997
01:41:46,715 --> 01:41:49,014
that mission is accomplished.

998
01:41:49,314 --> 01:41:52,413
Afterwards, we have
some ideas of our own.

999
01:41:53,713 --> 01:41:55,513
You mean getting home?

1000
01:41:55,712 --> 01:41:58,012
- Back to your family?
- That's right.

1001
01:41:58,212 --> 01:42:01,411
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

1002
01:42:01,611 --> 01:42:03,510
I'm sure you have.

1003
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:06,610
I know Colin has.

1004
01:42:07,709 --> 01:42:09,809
And, Roger, I have too.

1005
01:42:10,009 --> 01:42:11,908
We think we can make it all the way.

1006
01:42:12,108 --> 01:42:16,607
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the escape. That must be my decision.

1007
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:20,906
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.

1008
01:42:21,206 --> 01:42:25,004
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1009
01:42:26,804 --> 01:42:29,003
No one has said you can't go.

1010
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:33,002
That's true.

1011
01:42:33,302 --> 01:42:35,502
I have thought about the Gestapo.

1012
01:42:37,701 --> 01:42:41,600
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1013
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:43,799
or dare go,

1014
01:42:44,899 --> 01:42:47,198
or should be permitted to play God,

1015
01:42:48,698 --> 01:42:50,498
I can't answer you.

1016
01:42:51,997 --> 01:42:53,697
But I can tell you

1017
01:42:54,197 --> 01:42:57,796
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
to himself and the whole plan,

1018
01:42:57,996 --> 01:43:00,795
and must therefore be
eliminated from the operation.

1019
01:43:11,992 --> 01:43:16,990
Colin's not a blind man as long
as he's with me, and he's going with me.

1020
01:43:23,289 --> 01:43:25,488
It's all right with you, Colin?

1021
01:43:27,487 --> 01:43:30,087
Oh, yes. Quite.

1022
01:43:37,885 --> 01:43:43,383
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape
numbers to be altered accordingly.

1023
01:43:44,483 --> 01:43:46,382
Good night, gentlemen.

1024
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:55,180
Actually...

1025
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,579
he's quite right.

1026
01:43:58,779 --> 01:44:00,678
He's completely right.

1027
01:44:01,378 --> 01:44:03,278
I really shouldn't go at all.

1028
01:44:03,578 --> 01:44:06,777
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1029
01:44:07,077 --> 01:44:10,376
I think they call it progressive myopia.

1030
01:44:10,976 --> 01:44:13,875
I can see things up here. Close to.

1031
01:44:14,275 --> 01:44:16,574
I can see to work, but...

1032
01:44:19,573 --> 01:44:21,873
you're just a blur.

1033
01:44:22,073 --> 01:44:23,972
I know.

1034
01:44:24,772 --> 01:44:27,071
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1035
01:44:27,371 --> 01:44:29,471
Colin, do you have any tea?

1036
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:33,170
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1037
01:44:34,969 --> 01:44:36,769
Splendid.

1038
01:45:22,856 --> 01:45:24,855
Hi, Hilts.

1039
01:45:25,055 --> 01:45:26,955
Hey, Mac.

1040
01:45:29,254 --> 01:45:30,654
When?

1041
01:45:30,854 --> 01:45:33,353
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.

1042
01:45:33,553 --> 01:45:35,952
Me, too. Let's get at it.

1043
01:45:36,152 --> 01:45:38,852
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1044
01:46:50,132 --> 01:46:51,332
What time?

1045
01:46:53,631 --> 01:46:55,531
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1046
01:46:59,930 --> 01:47:01,729
You OK?

1047
01:47:12,026 --> 01:47:13,726
Cavendish.

1048
01:47:14,026 --> 01:47:15,425
Griff, down there.

1049
01:47:15,525 --> 01:47:17,425
Goff, there.

1050
01:47:37,419 --> 01:47:40,319
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1051
01:47:41,318 --> 01:47:44,417
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

1052
01:48:14,209 --> 01:48:15,609
There are the lights.

1053
01:48:17,508 --> 01:48:19,708
Right on the tick, Danny.

1054
01:48:29,305 --> 01:48:32,204
Look down the tunnel, Danny. It's lovely.

1055
01:48:34,904 --> 01:48:38,203
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

1056
01:48:40,202 --> 01:48:42,602
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1057
01:48:42,802 --> 01:48:44,501
Yes.

1058
01:48:44,701 --> 01:48:46,600
No.

1059
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:49,300
I don't know.

1060
01:48:52,799 --> 01:48:54,698
It's time, Roger.

1061
01:49:07,095 --> 01:49:10,494
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1062
01:49:14,293 --> 01:49:15,693
It's all clear, sir.

1063
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:26,490
All set, Roger.

1064
01:49:39,186 --> 01:49:40,886
Roger.

1065
01:49:41,086 --> 01:49:42,985
Good luck.

1066
01:50:13,977 --> 01:50:16,376
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny.

1067
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:19,875
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1068
01:50:26,273 --> 01:50:28,173
Willie...

1069
01:50:28,473 --> 01:50:31,372
I can't wait. I must get out.

1070
01:50:31,872 --> 01:50:35,271
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

1071
01:51:03,363 --> 01:51:06,662
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!

1072
01:51:07,562 --> 01:51:10,461
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1073
01:51:10,661 --> 01:51:13,560
Danny, tell me what this is
and tell me quickly!

1074
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,659
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

1075
01:51:17,959 --> 01:51:20,159
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.

1076
01:51:20,359 --> 01:51:22,258
Let me out. Let me out.

1077
01:51:25,757 --> 01:51:27,857
Take him out, Willie. Take him out.

1078
01:51:43,052 --> 01:51:44,952
Danny? What is it?

1079
01:51:45,452 --> 01:51:47,451
Danny, what's going on?

1080
01:51:47,651 --> 01:51:50,750
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.

1081
01:51:57,448 --> 01:52:00,048
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.

1082
01:52:00,248 --> 01:52:03,947
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

1083
01:52:04,846 --> 01:52:06,646
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1084
01:52:07,446 --> 01:52:11,945
Sit down. Feel the top rung of
the ladder with your right foot. Got it?

1085
01:52:12,344 --> 01:52:14,144
Down you go.

1086
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:31,539
Danny cut out, huh?

1087
01:52:31,739 --> 01:52:34,238
Willie took him up top. Hilts, l...

1088
01:52:47,535 --> 01:52:50,034
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1089
01:53:07,229 --> 01:53:09,129
Right.

1090
01:53:16,227 --> 01:53:17,927
Bartlett.

1091
01:53:56,216 --> 01:53:58,316
All right?

1092
01:53:58,515 --> 01:54:02,114
- Hold on to yourself. You're 20 feet short.
- What do you mean?

1093
01:54:02,414 --> 01:54:05,114
20 feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1094
01:54:05,314 --> 01:54:07,613
The guard is between us and the lights.

1095
01:54:07,913 --> 01:54:09,612
How could that happen?

1096
01:54:09,812 --> 01:54:13,211
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

1097
01:54:27,408 --> 01:54:30,107
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1098
01:54:31,007 --> 01:54:32,906
We could postpone it.

1099
01:54:33,106 --> 01:54:36,205
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1100
01:54:40,404 --> 01:54:45,003
One chance. When the guard goes to the
far end, you might be able to move out.

1101
01:54:45,403 --> 01:54:49,302
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1102
01:54:49,602 --> 01:54:50,701
What about the towers?

1103
01:54:50,901 --> 01:54:54,200
They're gonna be watching
the compound, not the woods.

1104
01:54:58,699 --> 01:55:01,198
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1105
01:55:01,998 --> 01:55:03,698
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1106
01:55:05,597 --> 01:55:08,096
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1107
01:55:09,796 --> 01:55:11,795
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1108
01:55:11,995 --> 01:55:13,495
- What?
- 30 feet of rope!

1109
01:55:13,795 --> 01:55:17,294
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1110
01:55:32,390 --> 01:55:36,689
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1111
01:55:36,989 --> 01:55:40,788
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

1112
01:56:03,281 --> 01:56:05,181
He's over there.

1113
01:56:11,379 --> 01:56:13,279
Right. You go first, Eric.

1114
01:56:14,578 --> 01:56:16,878
I'm staying here till we get moving.

1115
01:56:28,275 --> 01:56:30,474
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1116
01:56:30,774 --> 01:56:32,274
Right.

1117
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:46,470
Thank you.

1118
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:48,469
- Good luck.
- Right.

1119
01:57:13,362 --> 01:57:15,262
We're moving.

1120
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:26,059
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1121
01:57:28,858 --> 01:57:34,057
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and
came to England because you're a flier.

1122
01:57:34,357 --> 01:57:38,555
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1123
01:57:38,855 --> 01:57:41,755
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1124
01:57:43,654 --> 01:57:45,754
If you don't go through that tunnel,

1125
01:57:45,953 --> 01:57:49,852
everything you've done
will have been for nothing - nothing!

1126
01:58:18,445 --> 01:58:20,344
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1127
01:58:23,143 --> 01:58:24,943
In here, Colin.

1128
01:58:25,543 --> 01:58:27,442
Sit down.

1129
01:58:32,441 --> 01:58:34,540
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

1130
01:58:38,139 --> 01:58:41,338
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1131
01:58:41,638 --> 01:58:44,338
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.

1132
01:58:48,137 --> 01:58:51,136
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?

1133
01:58:51,436 --> 01:58:53,535
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1134
01:59:00,433 --> 01:59:03,532
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?

1135
01:59:03,832 --> 01:59:06,232
Hilts is on the other end
of that rope in the woods.

1136
01:59:06,432 --> 01:59:10,830
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go, but keep Colin low.

1137
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:13,929
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1138
01:59:24,127 --> 01:59:26,026
What's that?

1139
01:59:26,926 --> 01:59:29,525
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!

1140
01:59:29,725 --> 01:59:33,124
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1141
01:59:33,424 --> 01:59:36,623
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1142
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:50,719
Willie.

1143
01:59:51,519 --> 01:59:52,519
Willie!

1144
01:59:54,718 --> 01:59:57,518
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1145
02:00:03,916 --> 02:00:05,815
Get 'em out.

1146
02:00:11,414 --> 02:00:13,213
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

1147
02:00:13,313 --> 02:00:16,612
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.

1148
02:00:18,812 --> 02:00:22,011
Light the lamps down there!

1149
02:00:22,611 --> 02:00:25,210
There's been an air raid
and they've cut the lights.

1150
02:00:25,410 --> 02:00:28,209
Danny, it's all right. Listen to me!

1151
02:00:29,709 --> 02:00:31,608
Danny, look.

1152
02:00:35,007 --> 02:00:39,506
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1153
02:00:46,404 --> 02:00:48,504
What the hell's going on?

1154
02:00:48,704 --> 02:00:51,403
- You go.
- No. Danny.

1155
02:00:53,502 --> 02:00:55,302
Go.

1156
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:04,899
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.

1157
02:01:05,099 --> 02:01:07,199
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.

1158
02:01:07,399 --> 02:01:09,398
Get him out fast.

1159
02:01:11,897 --> 02:01:13,797
Come on.

1160
02:01:16,296 --> 02:01:18,196
Come on, Danny, move.

1161
02:01:34,491 --> 02:01:36,391
Up you go.

1162
02:01:42,389 --> 02:01:44,288
Give me your bag.

1163
02:01:51,087 --> 02:01:52,986
We're on the rope!

1164
02:02:38,374 --> 02:02:41,773
You and I had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

1165
02:02:42,073 --> 02:02:46,172
It's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

1166
02:02:47,171 --> 02:02:48,971
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1167
02:03:35,858 --> 02:03:37,958
Come on, come on.

1168
02:03:56,952 --> 02:03:57,952
Come on.

1169
02:04:16,447 --> 02:04:17,947
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1170
02:04:18,946 --> 02:04:20,746
Don't shoot!

1171
02:04:21,746 --> 02:04:23,445
Don't shoot!

1172
02:04:27,644 --> 02:04:29,643
Get off! We're coming back!

1173
02:04:52,937 --> 02:04:55,936
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1174
02:04:56,236 --> 02:04:58,935
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

1175
02:04:59,135 --> 02:05:01,335
We would've heard the shots before.

1176
02:05:04,034 --> 02:05:05,034
Pull!

1177
02:05:05,134 --> 02:05:07,033
Wait for me.

1178
02:05:12,732 --> 02:05:14,531
Out.

1179
02:05:35,525 --> 02:05:36,625
Out.

1180
02:06:11,216 --> 02:06:13,215
- How many did he say?
- 76.

1181
02:06:13,415 --> 02:06:14,715
76.

1182
02:06:14,815 --> 02:06:16,414
- 76.
- 76.

1183
02:06:30,910 --> 02:06:32,710
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!

1184
02:07:29,794 --> 02:07:32,794
Half the guys who missed
their trains are piled up here.

1185
02:07:32,993 --> 02:07:36,093
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.

1186
02:07:36,393 --> 02:07:38,192
Makes quite a group.

1187
02:07:38,392 --> 02:07:41,991
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.

1188
02:13:46,792 --> 02:13:48,691
Tallyho.

1189
02:14:31,779 --> 02:14:33,679
Tallyho.

1190
02:15:06,570 --> 02:15:10,269
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.

1191
02:15:10,569 --> 02:15:12,468
All right.

1192
02:15:17,067 --> 02:15:21,166
- I'll tell you when.
- I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.

1193
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:43,660
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1194
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:46,159
That's quite exciting.

1195
02:15:47,759 --> 02:15:50,558
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.

1196
02:16:46,643 --> 02:16:48,542
Switzerland.

1197
02:17:21,733 --> 02:17:22,833
Hey!

1198
02:21:31,265 --> 02:21:32,165
Bartlett.

1199
02:22:31,549 --> 02:22:36,147
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I... I hadn't quite decided.

1200
02:22:36,447 --> 02:22:39,146
What information were you
to collect on the way?

1201
02:22:39,346 --> 02:22:40,146
None.

1202
02:22:40,346 --> 02:22:42,945
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

1203
02:22:43,245 --> 02:22:45,445
What have you done with your papers?

1204
02:22:47,344 --> 02:22:50,543
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1205
02:22:50,743 --> 02:22:53,942
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1206
02:22:54,242 --> 02:22:56,242
All I did was escape from a prison camp.

1207
02:22:56,342 --> 02:22:59,841
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

1208
02:23:00,541 --> 02:23:04,140
- I wanted to get home.
- I don't think you'll see your wife again.

1209
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:06,839
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1210
02:23:07,039 --> 02:23:09,238
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1211
02:23:10,638 --> 02:23:13,937
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1212
02:23:14,337 --> 02:23:18,136
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

1213
02:23:19,835 --> 02:23:22,535
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover some oil smears

1214
02:23:22,735 --> 02:23:24,834
I picked up when I was shot down.

1215
02:23:35,631 --> 02:23:38,430
And you lost your insignia
over the years?

1216
02:23:38,730 --> 02:23:40,530
That's right.

1217
02:23:45,728 --> 02:23:48,028
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

1218
02:24:12,721 --> 02:24:14,620
Hello, boys.

1219
02:24:18,619 --> 02:24:20,419
Hello.

1220
02:24:22,818 --> 02:24:25,018
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1221
02:24:26,717 --> 02:24:29,116
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1222
02:24:29,416 --> 02:24:31,916
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1223
02:24:49,711 --> 02:24:52,110
There's a trainer out there I can fly.

1224
02:24:52,310 --> 02:24:54,909
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1225
02:26:02,991 --> 02:26:07,490
Colin, when I say go,
crank this clockwise.

1226
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:12,888
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.

1227
02:26:26,584 --> 02:26:27,584
Go!

1228
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:19,870
Next stop, Switzerland!

1229
02:28:42,347 --> 02:28:44,347
The Alps.

1230
02:28:44,647 --> 02:28:45,846
Splendid.

1231
02:28:57,643 --> 02:29:01,842
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1232
02:29:28,935 --> 02:29:32,634
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.

1233
02:29:58,227 --> 02:30:00,626
Go that way! I'll follow.

1234
02:30:25,319 --> 02:30:26,319
Hendley?

1235
02:30:31,318 --> 02:30:33,217
Colin!

1236
02:30:37,216 --> 02:30:39,316
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

1237
02:30:43,514 --> 02:30:47,813
Colin, I'm sorry I fouled things up.

1238
02:30:49,213 --> 02:30:51,012
That's all right.

1239
02:30:52,112 --> 02:30:54,012
Thank you for...

1240
02:30:54,911 --> 02:30:57,811
getting me out.

1241
02:34:00,361 --> 02:34:02,260
Caf Suzette.

1242
02:34:35,751 --> 02:34:37,551
Hello?

1243
02:34:38,250 --> 02:34:40,150
Hello?

1244
02:35:17,440 --> 02:35:18,839
Resistance.

1245
02:35:19,039 --> 02:35:20,939
Resistance?

1246
02:35:21,539 --> 02:35:23,438
You are English?

1247
02:35:24,138 --> 02:35:26,037
I'm Australian.

1248
02:35:27,037 --> 02:35:31,436
- You can speak English. I understand.
- Bloody good. I'm a British officer.

1249
02:35:31,736 --> 02:35:35,035
I've just escaped from
a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1250
02:35:35,335 --> 02:35:39,034
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?

1251
02:35:39,334 --> 02:35:41,133
Can you help me?

1252
02:35:44,932 --> 02:35:47,232
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1253
02:36:31,919 --> 02:36:33,019
Good luck.

1254
02:36:33,319 --> 02:36:34,819
Thank you.

1255
02:38:27,888 --> 02:38:29,487
You are English.

1256
02:39:10,976 --> 02:39:12,876
Herr Bartlett?

1257
02:39:20,374 --> 02:39:22,273
Your German is good.

1258
02:39:22,973 --> 02:39:25,172
And I hear also your French.

1259
02:39:27,072 --> 02:39:29,971
Your arms... up!

1260
02:40:06,361 --> 02:40:08,260
Herr Bartlett.

1261
02:40:08,860 --> 02:40:11,160
And Herr MacDonald.

1262
02:40:14,159 --> 02:40:16,258
We are together again.

1263
02:40:16,958 --> 02:40:20,757
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1264
02:40:36,853 --> 02:40:40,352
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.

1265
02:40:40,552 --> 02:40:43,851
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1266
02:40:44,251 --> 02:40:46,050
Yes.

1267
02:40:46,250 --> 02:40:48,649
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.

1268
02:40:48,849 --> 02:40:51,349
I hope to God I haven't
blotted 70-odd ledgers.

1269
02:40:51,549 --> 02:40:53,748
Och, no, no.

1270
02:40:53,948 --> 02:40:57,447
We're all over 21 ,
footloose and fancy-free.

1271
02:40:57,747 --> 02:41:00,546
We'd never have got as far
as we did without you, Roger.

1272
02:41:00,746 --> 02:41:04,545
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1273
02:41:04,845 --> 02:41:07,344
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1274
02:41:47,234 --> 02:41:50,833
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1275
02:41:51,132 --> 02:41:54,432
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1276
02:42:15,626 --> 02:42:21,324
You know, Mac, all this - the organisation,
tunnelling, Tom and Harry -

1277
02:42:21,624 --> 02:42:24,023
kept me alive.

1278
02:42:24,223 --> 02:42:26,123
And even though we...

1279
02:42:27,622 --> 02:42:29,822
I've never been happier.

1280
02:42:30,922 --> 02:42:32,721
You know, Mac...

1281
02:43:13,110 --> 02:43:16,109
1 1 of your men are being returned today.

1282
02:43:16,409 --> 02:43:17,909
Oh, who?

1283
02:43:18,009 --> 02:43:20,108
I do not have that information.

1284
02:43:20,508 --> 02:43:22,408
I...

1285
02:43:23,107 --> 02:43:27,506
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that...

1286
02:43:28,906 --> 02:43:32,405
50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1287
02:43:34,004 --> 02:43:35,104
Shot?

1288
02:43:36,304 --> 02:43:39,903
Their... personal effects will be returned.

1289
02:43:43,502 --> 02:43:46,001
How many of them were wounded?

1290
02:43:46,901 --> 02:43:49,800
Here are the names... of the dead.

1291
02:43:53,799 --> 02:43:56,398
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1292
02:43:57,698 --> 02:43:59,597
None.

1293
02:44:00,097 --> 02:44:02,497
They - the higher authority -

1294
02:44:03,496 --> 02:44:05,996
only directs me to inform you that...

1295
02:44:08,995 --> 02:44:10,894
that 50 men were...

1296
02:44:17,093 --> 02:44:18,192
I see.

1297
02:44:20,392 --> 02:44:22,291
Addison, John.

1298
02:44:22,591 --> 02:44:24,391
Alladale, Peter.

1299
02:44:24,591 --> 02:44:26,490
Bancroft, Edward.

1300
02:44:26,790 --> 02:44:28,789
Bartlett, Roger.

1301
02:44:29,089 --> 02:44:30,889
Cavendish, Dennis.

1302
02:44:31,189 --> 02:44:33,088
Eldridge, David.

1303
02:44:33,988 --> 02:44:35,888
Felton, William.

1304
02:44:36,887 --> 02:44:38,787
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1305
02:46:02,964 --> 02:46:04,863
I am your guide, se?or.

1306
02:46:05,163 --> 02:46:07,163
Spain?

1307
02:46:28,757 --> 02:46:31,156
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1308
02:46:31,456 --> 02:46:33,855
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.

1309
02:46:34,055 --> 02:46:37,154
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.

1310
02:46:37,354 --> 02:46:39,854
What happened to Blythe?

1311
02:46:40,054 --> 02:46:42,353
He didn't make it, sir.

1312
02:46:42,653 --> 02:46:44,752
Roger was right about that.

1313
02:46:45,652 --> 02:46:48,451
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.

1314
02:46:50,851 --> 02:46:54,750
I've just posted the list. They shot... 50.

1315
02:46:55,449 --> 02:46:57,349
The Gestapo murdered them.

1316
02:46:58,749 --> 02:47:00,148
50?

1317
02:47:00,448 --> 02:47:02,248
MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1318
02:47:02,847 --> 02:47:03,847
Yes.

1319
02:47:03,947 --> 02:47:05,347
Danny and Willie?

1320
02:47:05,547 --> 02:47:07,346
No, they're not on the list.

1321
02:47:07,946 --> 02:47:09,746
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1322
02:47:12,145 --> 02:47:13,345
I'm sorry.

1323
02:47:15,444 --> 02:47:18,743
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

1324
02:47:18,943 --> 02:47:21,142
Mess up the works.

1325
02:47:21,542 --> 02:47:24,542
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1326
02:47:25,141 --> 02:47:27,141
Do you think it was worth the price?

1327
02:47:28,341 --> 02:47:30,840
That depends on your
point of view, Hendley.

1328
02:47:34,039 --> 02:47:35,938
Yes, sir.

1329
02:48:25,425 --> 02:48:29,224
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1330
02:48:37,122 --> 02:48:39,421
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1331
02:48:39,621 --> 02:48:43,020
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...

1332
02:48:45,519 --> 02:48:47,219
How many?

1333
02:48:47,419 --> 02:48:49,318
50.

1334
02:48:50,518 --> 02:48:55,517
It looks, after all, as if
you will see Berlin before I do.

1335
02:49:48,302 --> 02:49:50,202
Sir.

1336
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:58,400
Hey, Hilts!
