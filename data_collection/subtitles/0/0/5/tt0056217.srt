1
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:17,078
- Thank you, Jason. On time.
- You bet!

2
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:22,361
Link. Link Appleyard!

3
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,965
- Miss Hallie.
- Hello, Marshal.

4
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:29,522
- Howdy, Mr Senator.
- No, no. Rance. Rance.

5
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,843
Rance. Sure glad you could come.

6
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,799
Your wire caught us in St Louis.
Thank you.

7
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:40,204
My buckboard's right over there.
Jason, give me that box.

8
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,078
You knew they were coming!

9
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:46,166
That's the first time you ever
kept a secret! Blabbermouth!

10
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,675
Was that anybody
worth a line in the paper?

11
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:53,005
A line? You blasted young fool,
that's Senator Stoddard and his wife.

12
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,005
You can fill your newspaper
with them!

13
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:02,240
Hi, Lydia. Charlie Hasbrouck.
Emergency!

14
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:06,565
Tell the office Senator Stoddard
and his wife just got here!

15
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:10,441
- That's right! Thanks!
- Hey, that's a nickel!

16
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,603
Charge the "Shinbone Star"!

17
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:27,678
Senator! Senator Stoddard, ma'am.

18
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:32,243
Could you give me an interview?
Exclusive-like. A scoop!

19
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:38,044
"Shinbone Star"...
Well, now, son... all right.

20
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:41,363
I'll give the interview,
but only for one reason.

21
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:43,398
One reason. Dutton Peabody, founder,

22
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:48,999
publisher, editor in chief
of the "Shinbone Star" once fired me.

23
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:52,198
I'll be fired
if I don't get this interview.

24
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:55,922
Is it true you're going to...
Here he comes now.

25
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:03,196
Senator Stoddard, this is a surprise
and an honour, sir!

26
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:06,523
- Maxwell Scott, editor.
- How do you do, Mr Scott?

27
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:09,445
- This is Mrs Stoddard.
- A pleasure, ma'am.

28
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:12,684
What brings you back to town, sir?
Is it true?

29
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,763
Oh, no. Hold on, Mr Scott.

30
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:18,880
Who am I giving this interview to,
you or this young fellow?

31
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,885
- Who asked first, by the way.
- I sure did.

32
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:26,955
If you're a good reporter invite
them in, out of the sun and dust.

33
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,477
He's right. To make a man talk,
make him comfortable.

34
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:34,566
It's back in business again.
Politics.

35
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,680
Link, why don't you take Hallie
for a little ride around town?

36
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,797
Lot of changes, huh?

37
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,726
I'll go with these fellows
and mend a few political fences.

38
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:56,083
I notice
you're not wearing the star.

39
00:04:56,127 --> 00:05:01,565
Shucks, Miss Hallie. They haven't
elected me Town Marshal for ages.

40
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:07,364
The only one of us from the old days
still working steady is the senator.

41
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:16,159
Place has sure changed.
Churches, high school, shops.

42
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:23,364
Well, the railroad done that.
Desert's still the same.

43
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:32,035
- The cactus rose is in blossom.
- Maybe...

44
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:41,319
Maybe you'd like to take a ride out
desert way, and maybe look around.

45
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,803
Maybe.

46
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,919
You knew where I wanted to go,
didn't you?

47
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:30,404
Well, you said you wanted
to see the cactus blossoms.

48
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:33,598
There's his house down there,
what's left of it.

49
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:35,603
Blossoms all around it.

50
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:44,075
He never did finish that room
he started to build on, did he?

51
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:48,757
No...
Well, you know all about that.

52
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,603
There's a lovely one there.

53
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:40,602
Gentlemen, I promised myself
this trip I would not talk politics,

54
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:44,925
and look here,
that's about all I've been doing.

55
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,721
Surely you're going to Capitol City
and talk to the assembly?

56
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:51,406
Not this trip. It's purely personal.

57
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:55,201
Purely personal? That isn't good
enough for my readers.

58
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:58,239
Why did you come to Shinbone?
No mystery, is there?

59
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:04,886
No. No, there's no mystery.
I'm here to go to a funeral.

60
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:09,155
- Funeral?
- Who's dead, sir?

61
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:14,042
- No, sir. I...
- A man by the name of Tom Doniphon.

62
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:20,681
There's my good wife. I'll...
I've enjoyed the visit, gentlemen.

63
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,524
Tom Doniphon?

64
00:08:57,327 --> 00:09:02,845
- Hello, Clute.
- Ransom Stoddard! And Miss Hallie!

65
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:07,915
Senator, I didn't think... Why didn't
you let me know they was coming?

66
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:10,640
I'd have had a real bang-up funeral.

67
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:13,997
Folks from all over everywhere
would have come.

68
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:37,082
The county's gonna bury him.
I won't make a nickel out of it.

69
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:01,684
Pompey?

70
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:20,436
- Miss Hallie.
- Pompey, I'm sorry.

71
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,922
Maybe you'd like to...

72
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,718
Where are his boots?

73
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:52,803
They was an awful nice pair of boots,
almost brand-new, and I thought...

74
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:56,999
Put his boots on, Clute,
and his gun belt and his spurs.

75
00:10:57,047 --> 00:11:01,120
He didn't carry no handgun, Rance.
He didn't for years.

76
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,044
Yeah, sure.

77
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:37,237
Sir, I don't wish to intrude,
but a United States senator is news.

78
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:42,557
I'm the editor of a newspaper
with a statewide circulation.

79
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,563
I've got a responsibility to know

80
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:48,486
why you came all the way down here
to bury a man.

81
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:52,679
You can't say his name was
Tom Doniphon and leave it at that.

82
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:54,922
Who was Tom Doniphon?

83
00:11:54,967 --> 00:12:00,246
He was a friend, Mr Scott,
and we'd like to be left alone.

84
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,039
Scott, let's go.

85
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:06,956
I'm sorry. That's not enough.
I have a right to have the story.

86
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,440
Yes, I guess maybe you have.

87
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:43,159
This story not only concerns me.

88
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,196
Old Pompey in there, Link...
they were part of it.

89
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,796
But I suppose I'm the only one
who can tell it through.

90
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:55,204
I read of the old days in the paper's
files. There was no mention...

91
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:58,603
You're a young man! A young man.

92
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,400
You only know it
since the railroad came.

93
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:06,567
A lot different then. A lot different
before, Mr Scott. A lot different.

94
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:10,395
First time I came to Shinbone,
I came by stagecoach.

95
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,642
A lot like that one right there.

96
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:24,323
Could be the same one.
Could be the same one.

97
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:29,397
"Overland"?
Say, I think it is the same one!

98
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,358
Well, I declare.

99
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,642
Well, I declare.

100
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:39,885
I was just a youngster,
fresh out of law school,

101
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:45,843
bag full of law books and my
father's gold watch, $14.80 in cash.

102
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:52,639
I had taken
Horace Greeley's advice literally:

103
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:59,600
Go west, young man, go west,
and seek fame, fortune, adventure.

104
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,477
Stand and deliver!

105
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,037
Shotgun, shuck your shells.

106
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:34,198
Throw down the cash box. Now!

107
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,637
All right.
Get the passengers out of the coach.

108
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:08,366
Looks like slim pickings,
but lift their wallets anyway.

109
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:20,483
- I'll take that pin, too.
- No. My dead husband gave it to me.

110
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:23,758
- Please!
- A widow? I'll take it...

111
00:15:23,807 --> 00:15:27,595
Take your hands off!
What kind of men are you?

112
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:29,638
This kind, dude.

113
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,445
Now, what kind of man are you, dude?

114
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:43,880
I am an attorney at law, and I'm
duly licensed by the territory.

115
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:47,602
You may have us now,
but I'll see you in jail for this!

116
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,399
Jail?

117
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,999
Stop it!

118
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:57,722
Get him out of here!
Get in that coach! Go on, move!

119
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:01,726
Get in there! You, too!
Come on, inside!

120
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:04,839
- He could die!
- We'll send him flowers!

121
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:07,764
Chico, cut the leaders!

122
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:24,605
Get going!

123
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:36,084
Put that in here
and get to your horses. Hurry!

124
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,322
A book?

125
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:40,844
Law?

126
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,197
Lawyer, huh?

127
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:10,684
I'll teach you law... Western law.

128
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:21,123
Let's get out of here.
Come on! Come on!

129
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,640
Hallie! Wake up, gal!

130
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:19,806
Tom Doniphon! 5:30am.
What's the matter with you?

131
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:23,044
We've got a man down here ambushed.
Ambushed!

132
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,760
Like to die
if we don't get care for him.

133
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:39,602
- It's the man from the hold up.
- That's right.

134
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,998
How did you know?

135
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,800
Stagecoach stopped by last night
to notify the marshal.

136
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,724
Link Appleyard?

137
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:51,601
Don't stand there gossiping.
Get him inside. Pompey!

138
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:55,606
Think you can make it, pilgrim?
Pick him up, Pompey.

139
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,638
Put him on the couch.

140
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:29,635
Tom, he's hurt real bad.

141
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:55,158
Thanks, Pompey.

142
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:04,886
Poor man. Beaten, whipped and kicked,
just for trying to protect a woman.

143
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:09,643
- How's that again?
- Stage driver told us all about it.

144
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:16,041
Well, Pompey, looks like
we got ourselves a ladies' man.

145
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:22,604
Hallie, we...

146
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,683
- Get some bandage.
- But...

147
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:27,036
I'll take care of him.

148
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:37,598
Pilgrim, you'll need
a couple of stitches.

149
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:41,959
Pompey, go find Doc Willoughby.
If he's sober, bring him back.

150
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:54,321
Nora, sorry to bust in on you
like this. He's in trouble.

151
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:58,679
- Such a beating.
- This is just simply terrible.

152
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:01,605
By golly,
I'm going to get the marshal.

153
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:05,640
You want coffee?
I make some breakfast. Hallie?

154
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:13,844
Take her easy there, pilgrim.

155
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,843
You all right?

156
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:42,926
Here we are. Drink this.

157
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:56,204
Is that coffee?

158
00:21:56,247 --> 00:22:00,240
Yah, coffee, and aquavit.
Swedish brandy. Good for you.

159
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:02,960
No, I don't care for that.

160
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,959
Here, you must drink.
That make you feel better.

161
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:12,638
It ain't mannerly out west
to let a fellow drink by himself.

162
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:26,685
- All right if I smoke, ain't it?
- Sure. Go right ahead.

163
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:49,646
- Good. Now you will feel stronger.
- Thank you, ma'am.

164
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:56,247
Took my watch. My money's gone,
every cent I had in the world.

165
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:58,801
Don't fret about that, pilgrim.

166
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:02,840
You can eat here
until you get back on your feet.

167
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:06,675
- My credit's still good, Nora?
- Yah, Tom.

168
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:13,842
- Lie down. Please lie down.
- No. No, not now.

169
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:19,726
Not now.
I've got something to do.

170
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:24,040
Got something to do.

171
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,877
What did you say his name was?

172
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:32,363
The man with the silver-knobbed whip?

173
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:37,037
I said Liberty Valance,
but if that's what you got to do,

174
00:23:37,087 --> 00:23:39,442
you better start packing a handgun.

175
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:42,882
A gun? I don't want a gun.

176
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:47,203
I don't want a gun.
I don't want to kill him.

177
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:49,758
I want to put him in jail.

178
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:56,797
I know those law books mean a lot
to you, but not out here.

179
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,919
Out here,
a man settles his own problems.

180
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:05,486
But do you know
what you're saying to me?

181
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:12,837
You're saying just exactly
what Liberty Valance said.

182
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,645
What kind of community
have I come to?

183
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,440
You all seem to know Liberty Valance.

184
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:23,002
He's a no-good, gun-packing,
murdering thief,

185
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,596
but the only advice you give me
is to carry a gun.

186
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:31,038
Well, I'm a lawyer!
Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law.

187
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:35,801
And the law is the only...

188
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:41,001
A little law and order around
Shinbone wouldn't hurt anyone.

189
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,641
All right, Hallie.

190
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:53,039
Arrest this man! Arrest him!
Nobody seems to want...

191
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:57,683
Well.
Here comes Mr Law and Order himself.

192
00:24:57,727 --> 00:25:02,960
- He's hurt bad.
- What are you dragging me here for?

193
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:07,000
Ain't being up all night on account
of this hold up business...

194
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,601
- Who's this?
- From the hold up.

195
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:14,435
- I knew I shouldn't come over.
- Wait a minute, Marshal.

196
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:20,483
Tom, if he's got a formal complaint
to make, he should make it to me.

197
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:24,440
He just wants you
to put Liberty Valance in jail.

198
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:30,363
Liberty Valance? Do you think
I'm crazy? Tom, let me out of here.

199
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:34,559
Hallie thinks he's right.
You'd better listen. He's a lawyer.

200
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:37,440
Somebody better listen to somebody
about him!

201
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:42,684
Mamma, Liberty Valance
rides into town...

202
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:47,562
If he behaves himself in this town,
I ain't got no...

203
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:49,518
Jurisdiction.

204
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:52,479
What he said.
I ain't got none of it.

205
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:55,087
You all know
I'm only the town marshal.

206
00:25:55,127 --> 00:25:59,166
What Liberty does out on the
road ain't no business of mine.

207
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:01,562
Ain't that right, Mr Lawyer?

208
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:08,400
Technically, I suppose
it is a territorial offence.

209
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:12,565
- You mean I'm right?
- Yes, Marshal, you're right.

210
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:17,727
I knew it! I knew we'd be friends
the minute I stepped in here.

211
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:22,045
You folks all know that,
well, the jail's only got one cell,

212
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:25,079
and the lock's broke,
and I sleep in it.

213
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:28,915
I should have known nothing would
happen when you came in here.

214
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:31,879
Now get out,
you big old fat water buffalo!

215
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:35,522
- We got work to do!
- Hallie, I ain't ate yet.

216
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:40,960
I could sure use a snack
of six or seven of those hen's egg

217
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:45,683
and maybe a side order of bacon,
and is that flapjack batter?

218
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:50,084
On the cuff. Sit down.
Papa, get your pants on!

219
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:52,846
Get out of the way! Sit down!

220
00:26:58,047 --> 00:27:02,325
You know, you look mighty pretty
when you get mad.

221
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:07,526
Like I say, you can eat here
till you get back on your feet.

222
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:13,517
- May I have your name?
- Doniphon. Tom Doniphon.

223
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:19,842
Forget what I said about buying
a gun. You're a tenderfoot.

224
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:25,924
Liberty Valance is the toughest man
south of the Picketwire, next to me.

225
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:58,523
- Mr Peabody!
- Evening, Marshal.

226
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:11,926
Did you know that Liberty Valance
is in town tonight?

227
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:14,640
I'd be a poor newspaperman indeed

228
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:17,645
if I didn't know
what everybody else knows.

229
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:21,043
I don't know what to do,
Mr Peabody, I swear.

230
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:23,999
Do what you're paid to. Run him out!

231
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,878
Run him out... Liberty Val... me?

232
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:29,044
- My advice to you as...
- Coroner.

233
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:33,080
- And your personal pos...
- Physician!

234
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:37,166
Is to get supper and go to bed.
No charge.

235
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:41,682
Sound advice, Marshal. Sound advice.

236
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:53,836
Hallie, my love, where are you?
I await you, my dear.

237
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:56,720
Good evening.
Saturday night, Mr Peabody.

238
00:29:56,767 --> 00:30:00,521
Better order early before those
drunks come from across the street.

239
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:06,039
Hallie, please. The proprieties
concerning the cutlery.

240
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:08,157
How many times have I told you,

241
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,756
the fork goes to the left
of the plate, the knife goes...

242
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:16,403
You superstitious or something?
What are you having to eat?

243
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:18,878
The usual.

244
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:23,079
Steak, beans, potatoes
and deep-dish apple pie.

245
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:28,679
- Three steaks with a lot of black.
- All right.

246
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:32,436
- Lot of black-eyes, Hallie.
- All right, Kaintuck!

247
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:35,524
Three steaks,
burnt black for the Lazy "J" boys.

248
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,957
Heavy on the beans.
Usual for Mr Peabody with fixings.

249
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:44,081
- Steak, beans, potatoes.
- And deep-dish apple pie.

250
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:48,279
Someday, he'll order something
different, and we'll all faint.

251
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:57,836
Goodness, Rance,
aren't you finished yet?

252
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:01,277
No wonder if your mind isn't on it.
Let me help.

253
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:04,683
Hallie, I found it. I'll show...
No, my hands are wet.

254
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:07,480
Get the book.
Come on, take the book a minute.

255
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:11,839
Nora, Peter, come here and hear this.
Now, get the book.

256
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:15,163
That place right here where it says,

257
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:19,758
"Under the law of this territory."
Hallie, you read it out loud.

258
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:24,676
I got Liberty Valance exactly where
I want him. Exactly where I want him.

259
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:26,922
What's the matter? Go ahead. Read it.

260
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:35,723
- I can't.
- What? You... Well, why not?

261
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:40,963
I never had the schooling,
that's why not.

262
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,718
You mean you can't read at all?

263
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:58,484
No, I can't read, and I can't write.
Here, take your book.

264
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:01,758
For heaven's sakes,
isn't Mr Peabody's order ready?

265
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:06,676
- Hallie...
- Not enough beans on it.

266
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:10,118
Hallie, I'm sorry.

267
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:15,597
I could teach you.

268
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,726
What for? What good has reading
and writing done you?

269
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:24,156
Look at you. In an apron.

270
00:32:28,287 --> 00:32:30,039
Be right with you, boys.

271
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:33,363
I do look funny in this.
I didn't mean to hurt her.

272
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:37,605
She'll get over it. What is
reading and writing for a girl?

273
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:41,526
She'll make a wonderful wife
for any man.

274
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:44,684
And if Tom Doniphon is smart,
he pops the question

275
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:49,118
before some busybody I am married to
upsets his bag of apples.

276
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,239
Aw, you!
Eat supper before come the drunks.

277
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:55,836
- But I'm not finished.
- Go sit down! Eat!

278
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,796
What you cooking, steak and potatoes?

279
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:24,681
I'm hungry. Could I impose
upon your hospitality?

280
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:28,117
Just a couple of those steaks
and no beans.

281
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:31,125
Marshal.
You're the man I'm looking for.

282
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:35,683
Not so loud.
And double on the potatoes.

283
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:39,037
One steak for one marshal
on the cuff.

284
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:44,886
Marshal, I was wrong the other day,

285
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:47,646
but I've been reading up,
and there it is.

286
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:51,157
I'll draw up the complaint,
take care of the details,

287
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:54,517
but you do have jurisdiction,
it says so right there.

288
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:59,436
The next time he sets foot
in this town, you arrest him.

289
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:05,403
Anything you say, Mr Stoddard.
I'll be tickled to death to...

290
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:10,520
- What was that? Arrest who?
- Liberty Valance.

291
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:15,880
Arrest Liberty Val...
You mean Liberty Valance?

292
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:20,239
Just when I was starting
to get my appetite back.

293
00:34:20,287 --> 00:34:22,881
A lot of black-eyes.

294
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,806
Steaks for the Brophy boys
with black-eyed peas. Burn 'em.

295
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:30,237
- They're sober tonight, too.
- Burn four.

296
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,201
Here's the supper for Rance.

297
00:34:44,887 --> 00:34:47,242
- Thank you, Hallie.
- Sit down!

298
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:50,279
You pop up
every time a girl speaks to you.

299
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,717
- You get in the habit.
- Rance, do you think I could?

300
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:56,998
I mean, grown-up and all?
Could I learn to read?

301
00:34:57,047 --> 00:35:01,916
Sure you can, Hallie.
There's nothing to it.

302
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:06,802
It'd be... Can you learn to read?!
Why, I can teach you.

303
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:11,204
A smart girl like you? Of course
you can. Do you want to try?

304
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:16,924
It's awful worrisome not knowing how.
I know the Bible from preacher talk,

305
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:20,482
but it'd be a soul comfort
to read it myself.

306
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:24,839
I'll teach you how. In no time,
you'll be reading everything.

307
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:31,836
Hallie, can I have
just one more steak?

308
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,441
One steak on the cuff!

309
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:55,797
All right, all right.

310
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,167
Excuse me.

311
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:05,680
- Nora, did you hear the news?
- No.

312
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:08,844
- Rance'll learn me to read.
- "Teach me to read."

313
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:11,003
Teach me to read.

314
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:17,719
I cannot say my ABC in Swedish.
Maybe you can teach me in English.

315
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,435
Sure, Nora.
You'll be my second pupil.

316
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,842
Hal's my first. You'll be my second.

317
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:25,321
Peter, you hear that? Peter!

318
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:32,278
Well, pilgrim, I see you're still
protecting the ladies.

319
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:35,364
Tom, look at you.
You're all dressed up.

320
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:38,524
- It's Saturday night.
- Don't you look handsome?

321
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:42,365
I brought you a little present.

322
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:45,524
Prettiest cactus rose
I ever did see.

323
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,285
It's a beauty. Look at it, Nora.

324
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:51,366
- Should look nice in your garden.
- But it should go in now...

325
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:55,366
- I'll be pleased to plant that.
- Thank you, Pompey.

326
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:58,444
The Hash outfit just arrived.
Burn eight.

327
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:04,040
- Not too close to the ocotillo bush.
- Yes, ma'am.

328
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:11,396
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."

329
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,602
You're a persistent cuss, pilgrim.

330
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:18,325
You really aim to hang that up
outside?

331
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:22,997
- That's why I painted it.
- Take some advice, pilgrim.

332
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:27,325
You put that thing up,
you'll have to defend it with a gun,

333
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:30,165
and you ain't exactly the type.

334
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:34,718
Comin' up.

335
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:37,445
Thank you.

336
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:42,515
A girl needs six hands on Saturday
night, and it's so hot. Look at me.

337
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:46,480
Any more colour and you'd be
prettier than that cactus rose.

338
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:49,724
Tom, that's mighty flattering.

339
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,806
Burn me a good, thick one, Pete,
meat and potatoes.

340
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:57,123
- Hello, Kaintuck.
- Evening, Tom.

341
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:05,038
- Tom.
- Object to company, Mr Peabody?

342
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:08,284
Not to yours, Tom.
Sit down, sit down.

343
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:14,840
I suppose you know
who's across the street?

344
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:19,237
Yeah. I hear he sent word on ahead.

345
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:24,441
He won't like what the town's been
saying about him and that hold-up.

346
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,165
How about you, Kaintuck?

347
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,959
- I'd like a st...
- Steak?

348
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,759
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well-burnt.

349
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:34,321
- And d-d-dee...
- Deep-dish apple pie.

350
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:36,801
- Yeah.
- Coming up.

351
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:41,640
Mighty nice girl,
that Hallie. Mighty pretty.

352
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:45,566
I agree with you, sir.
Just told her so.

353
00:38:45,607 --> 00:38:50,442
What? Do I hear wedding bells?
When can I print the story?

354
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:54,765
Don't rush me,
Mr Editor. Don't rush me.

355
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:03,445
There's your cactus rose.
Sure is pretty.

356
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:06,638
Thank you, Pompey. It is pretty.
Go and get supper.

357
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:08,643
Thank you, ma'am.

358
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:18,356
Look at that. Isn't that
the prettiest thing you ever saw?

359
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:20,477
Very pretty.

360
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:27,517
- Did you ever see a real rose?
- No.

361
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,842
But someday if they dam the river,

362
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:34,481
we'll have water
and all kinds of flowers.

363
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,405
When you finish the dishes,
will you help wait tables?

364
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:48,359
- Sure.
- Washing dishes is enough for him.

365
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:53,037
- A man waiting on tables?!
- No, I'd be glad to help.

366
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:56,238
- Be glad to.
- I thought we was busy.

367
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:35,684
These steaks look done
just right for us.

368
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:41,402
You cowhands ain't in no hurry
to eat, are you?

369
00:40:43,447 --> 00:40:45,517
Well, I am!

370
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:50,276
I guess we could do
with another drink.

371
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:54,599
That's right neighbourly
of you, partner.

372
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:01,477
Especially after all the lies

373
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:04,724
I hear folks been saying
about Liberty Valance.

374
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:12,004
Wait a minute!
One of Mamma's pies for Tom.

375
00:41:31,287 --> 00:41:33,721
Lookee at the new waitress.

376
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:51,602
That's my steak, Valance.

377
00:41:56,727 --> 00:42:00,561
You heard him, dude. Pick it up.

378
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:03,722
- No!
- Pilgrim, hold it.

379
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:07,476
I said you, Valance. You pick it up.

380
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:14,795
- Three against one, Doniphon.
- My boy Pompey in the kitchen door.

381
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:24,723
I'll get it, Liberty.

382
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:33,560
I said you, Liberty. You pick it up.

383
00:42:37,007 --> 00:42:41,683
What's the matter?
Everybody here kill-crazy? Here!

384
00:42:44,847 --> 00:42:51,400
There! There!
Now, it's picked up!

385
00:42:56,567 --> 00:43:00,480
Why don't you get yourself
a fresh steak on me?

386
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:07,197
Show's over for now.

387
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:15,204
Try it, Liberty. Just try it.

388
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,165
Get out!

389
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,806
I wonder what scared him off.

390
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:16,283
You know what!
The spectacle of law and order here,

391
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:19,205
rising up from the gravy
and the potatoes.

392
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:24,162
All right, you made your point.
The gun scared him off.

393
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:26,926
Pompey's gun, your gun, Tom.

394
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:29,401
Why did you interfere? He tripped me.

395
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,244
It was my steak.

396
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:33,596
And you would have killed him for it,

397
00:44:33,647 --> 00:44:37,276
or he would have killed you
over one measly steak!

398
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:41,400
- That's why I picked it up!
- Thanks for saving my life, pilgrim.

399
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:46,726
That isn't why I did it!
Nobody fights my battles.

400
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:17,522
Rance, I'm sorry.

401
00:45:31,807 --> 00:45:35,846
I'm not in the habit
of eating my steak off the floor.

402
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:44,882
Well, cool off, pilgrim.
It's all over. Nobody got hurt.

403
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:48,920
It's not all over, and everybody
here knows it. He'll be back.

404
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:52,482
He will, but not after me.
After you, pilgrim.

405
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:55,837
And you can't shoot back
with a law book.

406
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:57,798
What Peabody's saying is,

407
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:01,396
if you want to stay healthy,
there's two ways to do it.

408
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:05,042
Buy a gun or leave the territory,
is that what he meant?

409
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,555
- That's it, pilgrim.
- By golly...

410
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:11,156
I'd hate to see you go.
You're news, Mr Stoddard,

411
00:46:11,207 --> 00:46:14,165
and you've been news
ever since you hit town.

412
00:46:14,207 --> 00:46:17,119
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."

413
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:21,843
I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings out there.

414
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:25,562
I'll tell you what.
You decide to stick around,

415
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:29,236
and I'll let you hang this
outside the newspaper office

416
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,721
rent-free, for as long as it lasts.

417
00:46:31,767 --> 00:46:36,397
No. The first time
Liberty rides into town,

418
00:46:36,447 --> 00:46:40,281
he'll shoot it to pieces,
and the whole newspaper office.

419
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:45,685
- How about that, Mr Peabody?
- Well, that'd be news.

420
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:47,922
I accept your offer, Mr Peabody.

421
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:50,879
How about letting me hang that up
tomorrow?

422
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:56,243
- Tomorrow? Well, of course.
- Thank you.

423
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:58,084
Why not?

424
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:05,002
I'm staying,
and I'm not buying a gun either.

425
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:08,117
Good luck, pilgrim.

426
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:12,878
Hallie,
I'll be out of town for a while,

427
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:15,725
north of the Picketwire,
horse-trading.

428
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:20,356
Goodbye, Tom.

429
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:27,840
And take note of what goes on around
town, because by the time I get back,

430
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,924
there won't be no newspaper
to read it in.

431
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:05,318
- Well, any news?
- Hansons had a baby, eight pounds.

432
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:08,165
- But not twins?
- Not twins.

433
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:11,040
I got this list of voters for you.

434
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:14,397
There are 37 new registrations
over last year,

435
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:17,086
and not one needed a lawyer.

436
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:23,043
37? By golly!
If we can only get them to vote,

437
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:28,002
maybe we can handle those cattle
barons from across the Picketwire.

438
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:53,965
- Did you write this, Mr Peabody?
- Yeah.

439
00:48:56,487 --> 00:49:02,323
- This is great.
- You like it?

440
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,278
This thing's just great.

441
00:49:08,367 --> 00:49:11,962
As my old boss,
Horace Greeley, used to say,

442
00:49:12,007 --> 00:49:14,123
we'll tear their hearts out.

443
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:18,843
I'll be right there.

444
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:27,840
Let me have this.
I'll use it in class.

445
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:34,885
Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late.

446
00:49:34,927 --> 00:49:38,761
A teacher should never
be late for class. Take your seats.

447
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:43,722
Quite a turnout this morning.
We have more pupils every day.

448
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:47,919
- Morning, Marshal. How you feeling?
- Just fine, fine.

449
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,959
- Your head cold?
- No, no. I have a...

450
00:49:52,807 --> 00:49:56,766
Excuse me. I just wanted
to see how Julietta was doing.

451
00:49:56,807 --> 00:50:00,038
- Julietta's doing fine.
- Gracias, seor.

452
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:03,124
How's the rest of my family
doing in reading?

453
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,079
Hallie's in charge
of the kindergarten.

454
00:50:06,127 --> 00:50:09,199
Hallie, why don't you run through
the ABCs?

455
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:20,118
All right, you ready?
One, two, three.

456
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:24,046
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

457
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,841
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P

458
00:50:27,887 --> 00:50:31,562
Q, R, S and T, U, V

459
00:50:31,607 --> 00:50:35,566
W, X and Y and Z

460
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:39,566
Now I know my ABCs

461
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:43,043
Tell me what you think of me

462
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:45,925
That was just fine, just fine.

463
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:49,004
Well, I see a couple more
new pupils back there.

464
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:53,802
Highpockets, Kaintuck, you fellas
really serious about readin'?

465
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,560
Go on. Stand up. Tell him.

466
00:50:58,607 --> 00:51:02,805
Well, Miss Hallie, she
talked such a right smart argument

467
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:07,762
to the Lazy "J",
the boss of the Lazy "J".

468
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:11,800
He just up and told
all the hands to cut the cards

469
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:15,522
to see who come to school,
and I lost.

470
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:19,355
I see. We'll try.
Good morning, Mr Carruthers.

471
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:23,366
Good morning. Caught him
playing hookey again, fishing.

472
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:25,284
Catch anything, Herbert?

473
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:28,558
- No, sir. They weren't biting.
- That's too bad.

474
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:31,360
- Ain't you gonna whop him?
- He's too big.

475
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:34,126
For the benefit of those of you
just starting...

476
00:51:34,847 --> 00:51:39,682
None of us in here smoke,
Mr Carruthers. Thank you.

477
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,918
For those of you
who have just started,

478
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,243
I might explain to you
that we've begun the school

479
00:51:47,287 --> 00:51:52,236
by studying about our country,
and how it's governed.

480
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:56,438
Now, let's see. Well, Nora...

481
00:51:56,487 --> 00:52:01,117
Would you tell the class what you've
learned about the United States?

482
00:52:06,407 --> 00:52:11,003
The United States is a republic,

483
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:16,684
and a republic is a state

484
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:21,562
in which the people are the boss.

485
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:28,845
That means us.
And if the big shots in Washington

486
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:34,200
don't do like we want, we don't vote
for them, by golly, no more.

487
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:36,761
- Any more!
- Any more.

488
00:52:36,807 --> 00:52:40,004
That's fine, Nora. That's just fine.

489
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:43,403
Now, I wonder
if anybody in class remembers

490
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:46,678
what the basic law of the land
is called.

491
00:52:46,727 --> 00:52:51,437
You remember I told you it had
to be added to and changed sometimes,

492
00:52:51,487 --> 00:52:53,478
by things called amendments.

493
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:57,236
Does anybody remember?
Julietta, your hand's always up.

494
00:52:57,287 --> 00:53:00,165
Pompey, you try this one.

495
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:08,205
It was writ by Thomas Jefferson
of Virginia.

496
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:12,286
- "Was written", Pompey.
- Written by Thomas Jefferson.

497
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:16,286
- He called it the Constitution.
- Declaration of Independence.

498
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:22,880
It begun with the words...
"We hold these truths to be..."

499
00:53:22,927 --> 00:53:25,885
- Self-evident.
- Let him alone, Charlie.

500
00:53:25,927 --> 00:53:31,763
- "Self-evident, that..."
- "That all men are created equal."

501
00:53:34,607 --> 00:53:38,839
- That's fine, Pompey.
- I knew that, but I plumb forgot it.

502
00:53:38,887 --> 00:53:42,926
A lot of people forget that part.
You did just fine, Pompey.

503
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:45,527
- Thank you.
- This law also states

504
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:48,843
that governing power rests
with the electorate.

505
00:53:48,887 --> 00:53:52,482
That means you,
that means the people.

506
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:57,203
And you exercise this power
through the vote. Yes?

507
00:53:57,247 --> 00:53:59,681
Con permiso, los gentlemen's?

508
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:05,799
Well, Hallie?
Go right ahead, Hallie.

509
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:11,683
Here is the best textbook in
the world. It's an honest newspaper.

510
00:54:11,727 --> 00:54:16,118
This is the "Shinbone Star,"
Dutton Peabody, Editor in Chief.

511
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,239
And reading this ought to bring home
to everybody

512
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:23,565
the importance of using that vote.
Now, the headlines say:

513
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:27,520
"Cattlemen fight statehood.
Small homesteaders in danger."

514
00:54:27,567 --> 00:54:31,958
It says clearly that if big ranchers
north of the Picketwire River

515
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:35,522
win their fight to keep this
territory in open reign,

516
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:40,118
then all your truck farms and your
corn, the small shopkeepers

517
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:45,958
and everything, your kids' future,
it will all be all over, be gone!

518
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:49,044
And they call upon you,
in this article,

519
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:53,922
they call upon you to unite
behind a real strong delegate

520
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:57,755
and carry this fight
to Washington if necessary.

521
00:54:57,807 --> 00:55:01,800
Hello, Tom.
Welcome back. You want to join us?

522
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:03,838
I'm looking for Pompey.

523
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:08,005
I've been away three weeks, and
there's no sashes or doors in yet.

524
00:55:08,047 --> 00:55:12,916
Why have you been wasting time here?
Get to work. Your schooling's over.

525
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:16,562
Don't get rough with Pompey.
He's entitled to a...

526
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:20,680
What I got to say to you
will be a whole lot rougher.

527
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:24,276
The good editor here
has written some noble words,

528
00:55:24,327 --> 00:55:27,876
and you read 'em good,
but if you put that paper out,

529
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:31,237
the streets of Shinbone
will be running with blood.

530
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,404
Why are you against this,
you of all people?

531
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:38,645
Aren't there more votes
south of the Picketwire than north?

532
00:55:38,687 --> 00:55:41,997
That's right, but votes
won't stand up against guns.

533
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,481
Guns? What guns, Tom?

534
00:55:44,527 --> 00:55:48,600
You think Valance stays away
from here cos he's scared of you?

535
00:55:48,647 --> 00:55:51,878
He's recruiting hired guns
for the big ranchers.

536
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:55,203
- S, papacito?
- Take the little ones home.

537
00:55:56,327 --> 00:55:58,124
Come on.

538
00:55:58,167 --> 00:56:01,842
Hallie, it would be a good idea
if you dismissed class.

539
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:05,357
- Dismiss class?
- Go on. Dismiss them, please.

540
00:56:06,607 --> 00:56:09,041
Class dismissed! Same time tomorrow.

541
00:56:09,087 --> 00:56:11,521
You get to the store.

542
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:17,087
It could get worse
than the sheep wars.

543
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:19,402
You think
they'll start something here?

544
00:56:19,447 --> 00:56:23,281
It's already started. Valance and
his men crossed the river yesterday,

545
00:56:23,327 --> 00:56:26,922
killed a couple of sodbusters,
old man Holiday and his son.

546
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,242
You know that for a fact?

547
00:56:29,287 --> 00:56:33,803
I do. They tried to bushwhack me,
unfortunately for one of them.

548
00:56:33,847 --> 00:56:37,760
- You putting that in your newspaper?
- It's news, and I'm a newspaperman.

549
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:40,799
Print that,
he'll kill you sure as hell.

550
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:43,839
You think they'll come here, Tom?

551
00:56:43,887 --> 00:56:46,799
They'll be here,
tomorrow or the next day

552
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:50,556
according to how much
who-hit-John they consume,

553
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:55,283
but election day, pilgrim, you
can depend on it. They'll be here.

554
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:59,479
Hallie, go where you belong. I don't
want you in no shooting gallery.

555
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:01,802
Now, you listen to me, Tom Doniphon.

556
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:06,637
What I do and where I go isn't
your business. You don't own me.

557
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:12,404
Like I said, Hallie,
you're awful pretty when you get mad.

558
00:57:32,727 --> 00:57:35,241
Rance. After all you've taught us,

559
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:38,757
how can you say
we should knuckle under now?

560
00:57:38,807 --> 00:57:40,923
You heard what Tom said.

561
00:57:40,967 --> 00:57:44,960
When force threatens,
talk's no good any more.

562
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:56,524
Hallie, go find Tom
and make it up to him.

563
00:57:58,087 --> 00:58:00,396
He's only trying to protect you.

564
00:58:44,047 --> 00:58:46,038
Better let him go, Hallie.

565
00:58:49,287 --> 00:58:52,484
Why? Where's he going?

566
00:58:52,527 --> 00:58:56,156
He's going to need
all the practice he can get.

567
00:58:56,207 --> 00:58:59,643
Practice? What are you talking about?

568
00:59:03,847 --> 00:59:06,156
I might as well let you know.

569
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:10,485
When he came in with me,
I let him have a gun of mine.

570
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:14,918
He's been going out in the country
twice a week practising ever since.

571
00:59:16,367 --> 00:59:22,124
You mean he's going to face up
to Liberty Valance? Rance?

572
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:27,161
That's the only way I figure it.
He never discussed it.

573
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:29,675
He just keeps on practising.

574
00:59:38,847 --> 00:59:41,725
Tom! Tom Doniphon!

575
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:50,676
Hey, professor.

576
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:54,157
Where you going?

577
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:02,441
- I want to talk to you at my place.
- Tom, I'm going...

578
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:27,962
Step down, pilgrim. Take a look.

579
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,682
All right, Tom,
what are you trying to tell me?

580
01:00:36,727 --> 01:00:40,003
I'm telling you
that Hallie's my girl.

581
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:46,280
I'm building that room and porch
for her for when we get married.

582
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:49,717
Tom, I guess everybody
pretty much takes that for granted.

583
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:53,043
Everybody except Hallie, maybe you.

584
01:00:54,327 --> 01:00:56,887
That's a damn lie, and you know it.

585
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:02,958
Why did she come to me
fretting herself sick

586
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:06,716
because you were going to get killed
facing up to Liberty Valance?

587
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:10,237
- I never told her.
- Peabody did.

588
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:12,278
I think you're bluffing.

589
01:01:12,327 --> 01:01:16,957
I'm not bluffing about anything.
Wait a minute, Tom. What?

590
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:21,398
Pompey, bring two or three
of those paint cans.

591
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:31,722
- You have a gun, right?
- Yes.

592
01:01:31,767 --> 01:01:33,564
Get it.

593
01:01:39,887 --> 01:01:41,764
Come on.

594
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:48,476
All right, gunslinger.

595
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:54,278
Hit that can.

596
01:01:55,567 --> 01:01:57,603
Pretty far.

597
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:03,207
- Pilgrim, you got to cock it.
- I forgot.

598
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:15,485
Balance it light in your hand
and don't jerk the trigger. Squeeze.

599
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:17,643
You don't have to coach me.

600
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:31,001
Pompey, bring me those cans.
Give me that thing.

601
01:02:31,287 --> 01:02:33,403
I'll show you how easy it is.

602
01:02:34,327 --> 01:02:38,798
Take these cans.
Put them on those three posts.

603
01:02:40,527 --> 01:02:42,324
Go ahead.

604
01:02:47,687 --> 01:02:49,996
That's it. That first post.

605
01:02:50,047 --> 01:02:52,322
- There?
- That's right.

606
01:02:57,647 --> 01:03:01,162
Not there! On the far post.

607
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:04,323
That's right.

608
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:07,842
Now put that last one in the middle.

609
01:03:16,247 --> 01:03:17,805
Pilgrim.

610
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,996
I hate tricks, pilgrim,

611
01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:37,039
but that's what you're up against
with Valance.

612
01:03:37,967 --> 01:03:40,527
He's almost as fast as I am.

613
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:50,965
I don't like tricks myself,
so that makes us even.

614
01:03:55,927 --> 01:04:00,284
Pilgrim, you forgot your popgun.

615
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:23,676
I got you, Lyde. Ruf McMard.
Highpockets. Kaintuck.

616
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:26,400
Kaintuck! Leave the jug.

617
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:42,997
I am so proud of him.

618
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:48,881
Dutton Peabody
exercising his franchise.

619
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,964
- Dutton Peabody.
- Ransom Stoddard.

620
01:04:52,287 --> 01:04:56,041
Rance, we'll need you
for some of that legal stuff later.

621
01:04:56,087 --> 01:04:59,363
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."
Check.

622
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:05,199
- Peter Ericson, American citizen.
- Go on in, Pete.

623
01:05:05,247 --> 01:05:08,284
- See you for supper, Pete?
- Yeah.

624
01:05:12,527 --> 01:05:15,917
- Tom, look, we need a statehood!
- I agree.

625
01:05:21,087 --> 01:05:25,000
Herbert? You're too young to vote.
Back to school.

626
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,041
Greetings. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.

627
01:05:49,087 --> 01:05:52,363
- I'll have the usual.
- Bar's closed.

628
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,558
The bar is closed, Mr Editor,
during voting.

629
01:05:55,607 --> 01:05:57,757
You can blame your lawyer friend.

630
01:05:57,807 --> 01:06:02,642
He says that's one of the fundamental
laws of democracy, no exception.

631
01:06:03,487 --> 01:06:09,084
No exceptions for the working press?
That's carrying democracy too far.

632
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:12,124
A small beer.

633
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:14,806
Bar's closed.
Give me that bung starter.

634
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,998
All right. Settle down!
Sit down, everybody!

635
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:28,242
Come on. Settle down.

636
01:06:32,047 --> 01:06:36,199
Since our legal authority
closed the bar on us,

637
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:41,082
I propose that Ransom Stoddard,
Attorney at Law,

638
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:43,277
come up here and run this meeting.

639
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:46,359
- I second the motion.
- I third it.

640
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,998
Ransom. There he is. There he is.

641
01:07:09,207 --> 01:07:11,641
All right. All right. All right.

642
01:07:11,687 --> 01:07:16,397
All right, now, if you want,
I can show you the rules.

643
01:07:17,727 --> 01:07:21,925
The meeting will come to order.
Settle down please.

644
01:07:21,967 --> 01:07:25,243
Mr Peabody, would you keep
a record of the meeting?

645
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:29,286
Rance, please. There are other men...
Give me a drink.

646
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:31,477
- Bar's closed.
- Just a beer!

647
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,882
- Bar's closed.
- A beer's not drinking!

648
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:36,964
- Before we start...
- Sit down, Doctor, please?

649
01:07:38,247 --> 01:07:41,717
I have a pencil right here.
Thank you.

650
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:47,123
You all know why we're here.

651
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:51,240
We're here to elect two delegates,
because a growing population

652
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:54,597
south of the Picketwire entitles us
to two.

653
01:07:54,647 --> 01:07:56,877
These two delegates will represent us

654
01:07:56,927 --> 01:08:00,203
in the territorial convention
for statehood.

655
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:06,004
You know the issue.

656
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:10,040
The cattle interests want to keep
this territory an open range.

657
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,362
No!

658
01:08:12,407 --> 01:08:16,366
Ruled by their high-handed ideas,
whatever they are.

659
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:20,844
And we - that means everybody
in this room - we're for statehood!

660
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:29,885
We want statehood, because it means
the protection of farms and fences.

661
01:08:29,927 --> 01:08:33,886
It means schools for our children
and progress for the future!

662
01:08:36,647 --> 01:08:38,797
Just sit down, please.

663
01:08:38,847 --> 01:08:43,045
Now we'll proceed
with the nominations.

664
01:08:43,087 --> 01:08:45,442
You can nominate as many as you like,

665
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:48,718
and in order to show you
how this procedure works,

666
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,803
I'll leave the chair temporarily.

667
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:53,202
That's parliamentary law.
You can do that.

668
01:08:53,247 --> 01:08:58,844
I'll step out of the chair,
and I'll make the first nomination.

669
01:08:58,887 --> 01:09:04,086
I'd like to nominate a man I think
is the only man in Shinbone

670
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:08,279
who has the right qualifications to
lead us in our fight for statehood.

671
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:11,364
I could stand here
talking about him all day,

672
01:09:11,407 --> 01:09:14,080
but I know everybody here
could do the same.

673
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:18,484
I don't think that's necessary.
I nominate Tom Doniphon.

674
01:09:31,327 --> 01:09:34,444
Come on, sit down. Sit down.

675
01:09:36,367 --> 01:09:39,643
Stop sucking on that cigar
and put that pencil away.

676
01:09:39,687 --> 01:09:43,396
- I refuse the nomination.
- You can't refuse now.

677
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:48,646
Yes I can, because I got
other plans, personal plans.

678
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:52,236
Mr Attorney, go on with your meeting.

679
01:10:07,847 --> 01:10:11,044
You don't live south
of the Picketwire. You can't vote.

680
01:10:11,087 --> 01:10:13,521
I live where I hang my hat.

681
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:29,120
Come on, move! Out of the way!

682
01:10:38,927 --> 01:10:42,966
Hashslinger, why are you
standing there so high and mighty?

683
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:46,556
He's running this here meeting,
or hadn't you heard?

684
01:10:46,607 --> 01:10:48,563
The whole shebang.

685
01:10:50,127 --> 01:10:52,595
I'd like to nominate the chairman,

686
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:57,277
Mr Ransom Stoddard, as delegate
to the territorial convention.

687
01:10:57,327 --> 01:10:58,726
Wait a minute.

688
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:02,396
And I second that nomination,
not only because he knows law,

689
01:11:02,447 --> 01:11:04,517
but because he throws a good punch.

690
01:11:04,567 --> 01:11:08,116
Now listen, all you sodbusters,
you hard-rock farmers.

691
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:12,126
- I aim to be the delegate.
- You don't live south.

692
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,237
Floyd, say your piece like I said.

693
01:11:14,287 --> 01:11:16,243
I nominate
Liberty Valance for delegate.

694
01:11:16,287 --> 01:11:19,757
- I second the nomination.
- Move the nominations be closed.

695
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:24,642
Now wait a minute. That ain't
exactly legal, is it, Mr Attorney?

696
01:11:25,687 --> 01:11:29,680
We need two good delegates
to Capitol City, Valance,

697
01:11:29,727 --> 01:11:33,686
Two honest men.
We've got one in you, Mr Stoddard.

698
01:11:33,727 --> 01:11:38,198
- You looking for trouble, Doniphon?
- You helping me find some?

699
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:48,244
- You heard my motion, dude!
- All right. Put his name down.

700
01:11:49,127 --> 01:11:53,678
- Liberty Valance, address unknown.
- Have I got a right to speak?

701
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:56,605
- Go ahead, Highpockets.
- Then what about Mr Peabody?

702
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:59,286
He can read and write
and runs the newspaper.

703
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:01,443
Yeah, and when he's drinking,

704
01:12:01,487 --> 01:12:05,400
why, he can talk the ears
off of a w-wooden Indian.

705
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:08,483
I second the motion.

706
01:12:12,927 --> 01:12:15,361
No, you don't. No!

707
01:12:15,407 --> 01:12:19,923
I'm a newspaperman, not a politician.

708
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:24,165
No, politicians are my meat!
I build them up. I tear them down.

709
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:27,756
But I wouldn't be one.
I couldn't be one.

710
01:12:27,807 --> 01:12:31,038
- It would destroy me! Give me a...
- Bar's closed.

711
01:12:31,687 --> 01:12:36,203
Good people of Shinbone,
I'm your conscience.

712
01:12:36,247 --> 01:12:39,523
I'm the still, small voice
that thunders in the night.

713
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:43,321
I'm your watchdog
that howls against the wolves.

714
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:45,517
I'm your Father confessor!

715
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:50,920
- What else am I?
- Town drunk?

716
01:12:54,327 --> 01:12:58,240
- Dutton Peabody. Write it down.
- I move the nominations be closed.

717
01:12:58,287 --> 01:13:00,596
- I second the motion.
- All in favour?

718
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:04,317
Now we'll proceed with the election.

719
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:11,398
You sodbusters are a brave bunch
when you're together, but don't vote

720
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:15,565
any way now that you'll regret
later when you're alone.

721
01:13:19,447 --> 01:13:25,443
Those in favour of Ransom Stoddard
as delegate, raise your hands.

722
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:32,400
All those in favour of Liberty
Valance, raise your hands.

723
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:48,042
All those in favour of Dutton
Peabody, raise your hands.

724
01:13:49,127 --> 01:13:52,119
- Let's get you a drink.
- The bar's closed.

725
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:54,237
According to Mr Stoddard,
the bar's closed.

726
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:58,485
- Anything further on the election?
- Legally, the election's finished.

727
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,518
Then the bar is open.

728
01:14:08,887 --> 01:14:12,197
That vote don't mean a thing.
Stay out of this.

729
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,602
He's been hiding
behind your gun long enough.

730
01:14:14,647 --> 01:14:16,558
You got a choice, dishwasher.

731
01:14:16,607 --> 01:14:20,236
Either you leave town,
or tonight be on that street alone.

732
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,166
You be there,
and don't make us come and get you.

733
01:14:38,647 --> 01:14:41,798
Well, he called it plain.

734
01:14:43,447 --> 01:14:47,440
Too bad you didn't come
to me sooner with that gun.

735
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:54,963
Pilgrim. Come full dark, Pompey will
be at the Swedes' place

736
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:58,716
with a buckboard.
Why don't you leave town?

737
01:15:01,007 --> 01:15:03,157
Thanks.

738
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:37,165
"Liberty Valance defeated."

739
01:15:37,207 --> 01:15:42,679
D-E-F-E-E... T-E-D?

740
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:48,241
The unsteady hand betrays.

741
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:52,325
What's the matter, Mr Peabody?

742
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:56,560
Are you afraid?

743
01:15:58,767 --> 01:16:04,000
The answer is indub... yes.

744
01:16:10,327 --> 01:16:12,602
No courage left.

745
01:16:14,607 --> 01:16:20,045
Well, courage can be purchased
at yon tavern.

746
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:27,396
But have we credit?
That is the question. Have we credit?

747
01:16:28,607 --> 01:16:32,964
Well, credit is cheap.

748
01:16:35,847 --> 01:16:40,921
Wait for me,
old servant of the public wheel.

749
01:16:42,847 --> 01:16:46,601
Our shining hour is yet to come.

750
01:16:55,087 --> 01:16:57,476
As for you, Horace Greeley,

751
01:16:57,527 --> 01:17:03,045
go west, old man,
and grow young with the country.

752
01:17:18,647 --> 01:17:23,038
Don't do that, Mr Peabody.
Why are you out here?

753
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:26,762
Don't you know that everybody
is supposed to get off the street?

754
01:17:26,807 --> 01:17:30,402
My inalienable right,
the pursuit of happiness.

755
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:34,759
Sure, but it don't go to the saloon.
Liberty Valance is back there.

756
01:17:34,807 --> 01:17:38,197
You should hear
what he's swearing to do to Rance.

757
01:17:38,247 --> 01:17:43,685
And he ain't leaving you out, either.
Go in and let the Mexican fill that.

758
01:17:43,727 --> 01:17:48,960
But I doubt if my credit is good with
these Spanish-American gentlemen.

759
01:17:49,007 --> 01:17:52,886
Sure, it is. He's my wife's
step-uncle by her sister's marriage.

760
01:17:52,927 --> 01:17:56,317
But would you say something nice
about me in your paper?

761
01:17:56,367 --> 01:17:59,120
My dear friend, Link Appleyard?

762
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:02,000
The fearless,
fighting marshal of the west?

763
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:06,562
Your name will go down in history
with Buffalo Bill.

764
01:18:16,767 --> 01:18:20,521
Mr Peabody's drunker than a skunk
over in that Mexican joint.

765
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:22,523
He ain't eating tonight.

766
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,762
He "isn't" eating tonight, remember?

767
01:18:25,807 --> 01:18:29,277
Isn't, ain't,
what difference does it make?

768
01:18:29,327 --> 01:18:33,286
Ain't going to be no school anymore
with you leaving tonight.

769
01:18:37,687 --> 01:18:41,885
Good evening, folks. Mr Rance,
I have the buckboard out here.

770
01:18:41,927 --> 01:18:45,840
I'll be waiting for you
if you need me.

771
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:49,243
Go, Rance. Go now, while you can.

772
01:18:49,287 --> 01:18:52,643
Nora and Hallie
can finish the dishes.

773
01:18:55,807 --> 01:18:58,958
Go. Please go.

774
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:04,000
I owe you for
three days' room and board.

775
01:19:05,327 --> 01:19:09,843
I want to square my account. I want
to square my account before I go.

776
01:19:27,287 --> 01:19:32,236
And those in England now asleep
shall think themselves accursed.

777
01:19:32,287 --> 01:19:35,438
They were not here whilst any lives

778
01:19:35,487 --> 01:19:39,878
that fought with us
on St Crispin's Day.

779
01:19:42,367 --> 01:19:46,758
But when the blast, the blast of war,

780
01:19:46,807 --> 01:19:51,198
blows in our ears and we summon up...

781
01:19:54,567 --> 01:19:58,719
Liberty Valance. And his vermidons!

782
01:20:05,727 --> 01:20:10,960
Liberty Valance taking liberties
with the liberty of the press?

783
01:20:11,327 --> 01:20:15,400
- Had your supper yet, Peabody?
- My supper?

784
01:20:15,447 --> 01:20:17,677
No. That's a splendid idea.

785
01:20:30,327 --> 01:20:34,878
- You can start by eating this.
- That's a poor joke, Liberty.

786
01:20:34,927 --> 01:20:38,283
Eat it!

787
01:20:41,727 --> 01:20:43,524
Eat it!

788
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,798
He's dead.

789
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:52,484
Mr Peabody.

790
01:22:57,247 --> 01:23:03,038
Rance? Rance Stoddard?

791
01:23:21,487 --> 01:23:24,479
- Mr Peabody.
- Let's get him up.

792
01:23:29,447 --> 01:23:32,166
- Where's Doc Willoughby?
- Still in the saloon.

793
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:34,004
Go get him.

794
01:23:34,287 --> 01:23:37,438
Rance? Rance!

795
01:23:46,927 --> 01:23:52,365
I sure told that Liberty Valance

796
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:57,845
about the freedom of the press.

797
01:24:09,647 --> 01:24:11,444
Marshal?

798
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:34,199
Marshal...

799
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:40,157
you tell Liberty Valance
I'll be outside.

800
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:30,517
- Pompey!
- Miss Hallie?

801
01:25:30,567 --> 01:25:32,762
- Where's Mr Tom?
- Down the road.

802
01:25:32,807 --> 01:25:35,275
Get him!
Rance is out front with a gun!

803
01:25:35,327 --> 01:25:36,965
Yes, ma'am.

804
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:40,238
You've heard of Gettysburg. 240...

805
01:25:40,287 --> 01:25:44,405
Doc, Mr Peabody's awful hurt.
He needs you at his office.

806
01:25:44,447 --> 01:25:46,836
What's wrong?
Somebody have an accident?

807
01:25:48,807 --> 01:25:52,800
So that's it. Another one of your
accidents, Valance?

808
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:56,760
I'm waiting for the day
when they'll call me for you.

809
01:25:58,247 --> 01:26:00,044
Paid in advance.

810
01:26:07,087 --> 01:26:08,884
$10 into the cans.

811
01:26:09,887 --> 01:26:14,756
Liberty, what you did to Mr Peabody,
ain't that enough?

812
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:17,157
Ain't that enough what, Mr Marshal?

813
01:26:17,207 --> 01:26:18,925
You all know that Rance Stoddard

814
01:26:18,967 --> 01:26:23,006
couldn't shoot the hat off his head
with a gun in his hand.

815
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:26,198
You mean, he's got a gun in his hand?

816
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:28,164
I'm calling you, Valance.

817
01:26:28,207 --> 01:26:30,323
Kings and threes.

818
01:26:30,447 --> 01:26:32,438
Good hand,

819
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:37,880
but not good enough.
An ace is an ace. Thank you.

820
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:41,962
If you gun him down,
it'll just be pure murder.

821
01:28:03,727 --> 01:28:06,605
Well, Mr Professor,
I thought you left town.

822
01:28:06,647 --> 01:28:08,638
Why are you out here?

823
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:13,758
I'm waiting for Liberty Valance.
Why doesn't he come out?

824
01:28:13,807 --> 01:28:16,640
Well, that's none of our business.

825
01:28:18,967 --> 01:28:21,686
You heard him say he had a gun,
right?

826
01:28:21,727 --> 01:28:24,241
- I didn't say that!
- That ain't murder.

827
01:28:24,287 --> 01:28:27,165
That's a clean-cut case of
self-defence.

828
01:28:27,207 --> 01:28:30,677
You heard him call me out,
didn't you?

829
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:34,203
Now get out of my way.

830
01:28:37,487 --> 01:28:39,842
Hashslinger, are you out here?

831
01:28:41,287 --> 01:28:46,236
I'd say that was Liberty Valance
there now. Wouldn't you?

832
01:28:46,847 --> 01:28:51,204
- Yes, I would.
- We be seeing you, Mr Stoddard.

833
01:29:05,047 --> 01:29:07,436
Come closer where I can see you.

834
01:29:14,567 --> 01:29:17,001
Get out of that shadow, dude.

835
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:04,043
You got two hands, Hashslinger.
Pick it up!

836
01:30:28,567 --> 01:30:35,006
All right, dude...
this time, right between the eyes.

837
01:30:50,247 --> 01:30:52,442
Liberty?

838
01:30:52,487 --> 01:30:55,320
Liberty? Liberty!

839
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,558
Hey, Doc! Doc!

840
01:31:16,367 --> 01:31:18,164
Liberty!

841
01:31:54,407 --> 01:31:58,605
It's Liberty! He's hurt!
It's Liberty!

842
01:32:02,567 --> 01:32:06,401
- Whisky, quick.
- Here, sir.

843
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:20,044
Dead.

844
01:33:09,447 --> 01:33:14,965
Rance, if it had been you
instead of Valance, I would...

845
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:18,761
Oh, no, Hallie. Hallie...

846
01:33:20,007 --> 01:33:25,206
I can't help it.
This feels so guilty.

847
01:33:26,527 --> 01:33:31,078
I didn't want you to run away.
I wanted you to stay.

848
01:33:31,127 --> 01:33:34,563
He might... I'm sorry.

849
01:33:34,607 --> 01:33:38,202
- Forgive me.
- Hallie.

850
01:33:38,247 --> 01:33:42,240
Hallie, please don't.

851
01:33:42,287 --> 01:33:45,040
Hallie.

852
01:34:01,407 --> 01:34:05,366
I'm sorry I got here too late,
Hallie.

853
01:34:05,407 --> 01:34:08,956
You got yourself
out of that fix real handy.

854
01:34:11,407 --> 01:34:13,398
I'll be around.

855
01:34:47,007 --> 01:34:51,159
- Tom! Liberty...
- I know.

856
01:35:04,647 --> 01:35:08,435
He wasn't going to kill him,
just nick him a little.

857
01:35:08,487 --> 01:35:11,877
He was just gonna make a pass.
You saw that!

858
01:35:11,927 --> 01:35:16,159
- That lawyer shot him in cold blood!
- Now, that ain't the way.

859
01:35:16,207 --> 01:35:18,721
It was murder! Pure murder!

860
01:35:18,767 --> 01:35:22,077
And I say if the marshal
don't put Stoddard in jail,

861
01:35:22,127 --> 01:35:24,687
we ought to
take care of him ourselves!

862
01:35:24,727 --> 01:35:28,515
- I say we ought to hang him!
- That's right! Hang him!

863
01:35:28,567 --> 01:35:30,558
Give him a rope! Let him swing!

864
01:35:30,607 --> 01:35:35,476
Can't a man get a drink
around this town in peace?

865
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:44,480
- No one's bothering you, Doniphon.
- You are!

866
01:35:48,607 --> 01:35:50,404
Marshal!

867
01:35:54,567 --> 01:35:57,127
Why are you paid? Drag this scum out.

868
01:35:57,167 --> 01:35:59,442
You heard him.
Kaintuck and Highpockets,

869
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:04,720
- I deputise you to give a hand.
- Hand me that bung st... That's it.

870
01:36:08,287 --> 01:36:12,360
Tell those ranchers north of the
Picketwire that hired you

871
01:36:12,407 --> 01:36:15,956
that me, Link Appleyard,
run you out of town,

872
01:36:16,007 --> 01:36:19,886
and I'll do it again
if you ever come back!

873
01:36:24,967 --> 01:36:29,916
- Now look, Pompey, you know I...
- Who says he can't?

874
01:36:29,967 --> 01:36:34,245
- Pour yourself a drink, Pompey.
- I don't drink no drams, Mr Tom.

875
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:36,084
I said take a drink.

876
01:36:36,127 --> 01:36:41,121
No. We got a mare in foal and horses
to feed and water. Come on home.

877
01:36:41,847 --> 01:36:44,441
Home...

878
01:36:46,807 --> 01:36:50,197
Home sweet home.
You're right, Pompey.

879
01:36:50,247 --> 01:36:54,001
We got plenty to do at home.

880
01:36:54,047 --> 01:36:58,279
Well, what are they
paying you guys for? Play!

881
01:36:58,327 --> 01:37:01,000
Be merry! Sing!

882
01:37:06,807 --> 01:37:08,798
Leave me be!

883
01:38:29,727 --> 01:38:31,524
Mr Tom!

884
01:39:01,287 --> 01:39:04,563
The horses, Pompey. The horses.

885
01:40:12,007 --> 01:40:15,044
Hello! How are you?

886
01:40:18,207 --> 01:40:22,837
- You made it on your own feet!
- Yeah! Thanks to Doc Willoughby.

887
01:40:22,887 --> 01:40:27,677
- Here. Let me pin this on you.
- That's him.

888
01:40:32,167 --> 01:40:36,080
- Well, this must be Ransom Stoddard.
- Rance, this is Handy Strong.

889
01:40:36,127 --> 01:40:39,358
How do you do, sir?
It's quite a city here.

890
01:40:39,407 --> 01:40:41,967
It's not much according
to your eastern standards,

891
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:45,841
but that railroad station there
leads straight to Washington.

892
01:40:49,047 --> 01:40:50,844
Come on, Rance.

893
01:41:05,527 --> 01:41:11,397
Order! Order!

894
01:41:11,967 --> 01:41:15,323
Order! Order!

895
01:41:17,207 --> 01:41:23,396
Order! Order! Quiet!

896
01:41:23,447 --> 01:41:26,086
Order! Quiet!

897
01:41:28,047 --> 01:41:31,642
The roll call having been completed

898
01:41:31,687 --> 01:41:35,726
and the delegates
recognised and seated,

899
01:41:35,767 --> 01:41:39,442
this session
of the territorial convention

900
01:41:39,487 --> 01:41:42,718
is hereby declared open.

901
01:41:45,567 --> 01:41:47,683
Order!

902
01:41:47,807 --> 01:41:50,367
Order!

903
01:41:51,687 --> 01:41:53,803
Mr Chairman.

904
01:41:56,207 --> 01:42:02,601
The chair recognises the Honourable
Major Cassius Starbuckle...

905
01:42:02,647 --> 01:42:06,435
soldier, jurist, and statesman.

906
01:42:06,567 --> 01:42:12,802
Mr Chairman, fellow delegates...

907
01:42:12,847 --> 01:42:14,724
ladies...

908
01:42:14,767 --> 01:42:18,203
and gentlemen,

909
01:42:18,247 --> 01:42:23,844
I came here
with a carefully prepared speech,

910
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:28,244
but this is no time for oratory.

911
01:42:33,927 --> 01:42:38,523
Let me speak to you from the heart.

912
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:44,365
I come before you
to place in nomination

913
01:42:44,407 --> 01:42:49,640
the name of a man
more qualified than any other

914
01:42:49,687 --> 01:42:53,157
to represent you in Washington.

915
01:42:54,167 --> 01:42:56,965
You ill-advised.

916
01:42:57,007 --> 01:43:00,363
You poorly counselled.

917
01:43:00,407 --> 01:43:05,242
Fly not in the face
of heaven's handiwork.

918
01:43:05,287 --> 01:43:09,075
Join with us in supporting the man

919
01:43:09,127 --> 01:43:12,517
who for five terms in Congress

920
01:43:12,647 --> 01:43:18,756
has kept this great territory
inviolate.

921
01:43:18,807 --> 01:43:24,200
I nominate
for the territorial delegate

922
01:43:24,247 --> 01:43:28,479
to the Congress of the United States

923
01:43:28,527 --> 01:43:32,202
the Right Honourable
Custis Buck Langhorne.

924
01:43:57,967 --> 01:43:59,605
Order! Order!

925
01:44:12,367 --> 01:44:16,565
Now that you got your rope on him,
hang the horse thief!

926
01:44:42,767 --> 01:44:45,964
Order! Order!

927
01:44:46,007 --> 01:44:49,966
This is a convention,
not a rodeo, Langhorne!

928
01:44:53,687 --> 01:44:56,076
Mr Chairman! Mr Chairman!

929
01:44:56,207 --> 01:45:00,519
The chair recognises
its old friend...

930
01:45:00,567 --> 01:45:05,004
that distinguished member
of the fourth estate...

931
01:45:05,047 --> 01:45:11,600
founder, owner, publisher and editor
of the "Shinbone Star"...

932
01:45:11,647 --> 01:45:16,243
Mr Dutton Peabody, Esquire.

933
01:45:20,007 --> 01:45:23,158
Thank you, Mr Chairman,
for those kind words,

934
01:45:23,207 --> 01:45:25,163
but tell them the whole truth...

935
01:45:25,207 --> 01:45:29,280
founder, owner, editor
and I also sweep out the place.

936
01:45:32,087 --> 01:45:35,045
Fellow delegates, like all of you,

937
01:45:35,087 --> 01:45:40,559
I've listened in awe and admiration
to the magnificent oratory

938
01:45:40,607 --> 01:45:44,316
of the Honourable
Major Cassius Starbuckle...

939
01:45:44,367 --> 01:45:46,005
the cattlemen's mouthpiece.

940
01:45:46,047 --> 01:45:48,925
The lowing herd is still with us.

941
01:45:50,567 --> 01:45:54,276
But, seriously,
under the spell of his eloquence,

942
01:45:54,327 --> 01:45:58,240
I could see once again
the vast herd of buffalo

943
01:45:58,287 --> 01:46:01,245
and savage redskin
roaming our beautiful territory

944
01:46:01,287 --> 01:46:04,677
with no law to trammel them
except the law of survival,

945
01:46:04,727 --> 01:46:07,844
the law of the tomahawk
and the bow and arrow.

946
01:46:07,887 --> 01:46:11,197
And then, with
the westward march of our nation,

947
01:46:11,247 --> 01:46:15,763
came the pioneer and the buffalo
hunter, the adventurous and the bold.

948
01:46:15,807 --> 01:46:19,004
The boldest of these
were the cattlemen,

949
01:46:19,047 --> 01:46:23,279
who seized the wide-open range
for their own personal domain,

950
01:46:23,327 --> 01:46:28,685
and their law
was the law of the hired gun.

951
01:46:29,967 --> 01:46:36,566
But now, today have come
the railroads and the people.

952
01:46:36,607 --> 01:46:40,156
The steady, hard-working citizens,

953
01:46:40,207 --> 01:46:46,806
the homesteader, the shopkeeper,
the builder of cities.

954
01:46:46,967 --> 01:46:49,481
We need roads to join those cities,

955
01:46:49,527 --> 01:46:52,644
dams to store up
the waters of the Picketwire,

956
01:46:52,687 --> 01:46:55,565
and we need statehood
to protect the rights

957
01:46:55,607 --> 01:46:59,202
of every man and woman,
however humble.

958
01:47:00,607 --> 01:47:03,440
How do we get it? I'll tell you how.

959
01:47:03,487 --> 01:47:06,479
We get it by placing our votes
behind one man.

960
01:47:06,527 --> 01:47:10,406
One man!
And we have that man with us here.

961
01:47:10,447 --> 01:47:15,885
He is a man who came to us
not packing a gun,

962
01:47:15,927 --> 01:47:21,001
but carrying instead
a bag of law books.

963
01:47:21,167 --> 01:47:26,161
Yes. He is a lawyer and a teacher.

964
01:47:26,327 --> 01:47:30,320
The first west of the rosy buttes.
But more important,

965
01:47:30,367 --> 01:47:34,838
he's a man who has come to be known
throughout this territory

966
01:47:34,887 --> 01:47:40,644
in the last few weeks as
a great champion of law and order.

967
01:47:41,167 --> 01:47:46,844
Ladies and gentlemen,
I nominate as your delegate and mine,

968
01:47:46,927 --> 01:47:52,877
to the Congress at Washington,
the Honourable Ransom Stoddard!

969
01:48:09,687 --> 01:48:11,484
Let's have order!

970
01:48:12,927 --> 01:48:15,043
Get going, Starbuckle.

971
01:48:20,687 --> 01:48:25,238
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you.

972
01:48:27,327 --> 01:48:29,158
Well...

973
01:48:29,527 --> 01:48:35,318
I see this demonstration,
but I can't believe my eyes.

974
01:48:35,367 --> 01:48:39,201
Is it possible
that such a representative body

975
01:48:39,247 --> 01:48:44,321
of honest, hard-working Americans
can endorse a candidate

976
01:48:44,367 --> 01:48:47,006
for the Congress
of our beloved country

977
01:48:47,047 --> 01:48:51,438
whose only claim to the office
is that he killed a man.

978
01:48:51,487 --> 01:48:53,682
Do you call Liberty Valance a man?!

979
01:48:56,927 --> 01:48:59,441
Order! Order!

980
01:48:59,567 --> 01:49:01,717
Hear me out!

981
01:49:03,447 --> 01:49:09,682
Who is this Ransom Stoddard?
And what qualifications has he

982
01:49:09,727 --> 01:49:14,437
that entitle him to aspire
to such great office?

983
01:49:14,567 --> 01:49:21,917
We are told he's a lawyer,
an attorney at law,

984
01:49:22,087 --> 01:49:28,640
an officer of the court.
Yes, but what kind of lawyer?

985
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:33,966
A man who usurps the function
of both judge and jury

986
01:49:34,007 --> 01:49:37,238
and takes the law into his own hand.

987
01:49:44,927 --> 01:49:48,317
Quiet! Quiet!

988
01:49:50,047 --> 01:49:53,676
What other qualifications
has he, then?

989
01:49:53,727 --> 01:49:56,685
The blood on his hands?

990
01:49:56,727 --> 01:50:00,003
The hidden gun beneath his coat?

991
01:50:00,047 --> 01:50:04,245
The bullet-riddled body
of an honest citizen?

992
01:50:04,287 --> 01:50:06,437
Honest citizen?! Liberty Valance?

993
01:50:06,487 --> 01:50:09,797
You fool! Liberty Valance,
an honest citizen?

994
01:50:09,847 --> 01:50:13,840
Is this your fearless champion
of law and order?

995
01:50:13,887 --> 01:50:18,836
- Mr Chairman!
- The mark of Cain is on this man,

996
01:50:18,887 --> 01:50:22,084
and the mark of Cain
will be on all of us

997
01:50:22,127 --> 01:50:25,676
if we send him
with bloodstained hands

998
01:50:25,727 --> 01:50:28,719
to walk the hallowed
halls of government...

999
01:50:28,767 --> 01:50:31,839
...where Washington...
- Mr Chairman!

1000
01:50:33,047 --> 01:50:35,117
- Mr Chairman!
- Order! Order!

1001
01:50:35,167 --> 01:50:41,720
...yes, and Lincoln still live,
immortals in the memory of man.

1002
01:50:41,767 --> 01:50:43,564
Mr Chairman!

1003
01:50:52,087 --> 01:50:53,076
Rance! Rance!

1004
01:50:54,647 --> 01:50:57,036
Order! Order!

1005
01:51:01,287 --> 01:51:03,198
Pilgrim.

1006
01:51:06,807 --> 01:51:11,244
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home, Tom.

1007
01:51:11,287 --> 01:51:14,085
I'm going back east where I belong.

1008
01:51:23,607 --> 01:51:29,318
Valance couldn't make you run away.
What is it now, your conscience?

1009
01:51:30,047 --> 01:51:35,758
Isn't it enough to kill a man,
without trying to build a life on it?

1010
01:51:35,887 --> 01:51:39,846
You talk too much, think too much.

1011
01:51:39,887 --> 01:51:44,483
Besides,
you didn't kill Liberty Valance.

1012
01:51:47,647 --> 01:51:51,720
- What?
- Think back, pilgrim.

1013
01:51:55,047 --> 01:51:57,845
Valance came out of the saloon.

1014
01:51:57,887 --> 01:52:02,085
You were walking toward him
when he fired his first shot.

1015
01:52:02,127 --> 01:52:04,163
Remember?

1016
01:52:25,607 --> 01:52:27,438
Pompey.

1017
01:52:32,487 --> 01:52:39,040
All right, dude.
This time... right between the eyes.

1018
01:53:02,647 --> 01:53:06,720
But...
Tom, why did you do it?

1019
01:53:06,767 --> 01:53:10,521
Cold-blooded murder,
but I can live with it.

1020
01:53:10,567 --> 01:53:13,843
Hallie's happy. She wanted you alive.

1021
01:53:13,887 --> 01:53:17,163
- But you saved my life!
- I wish I hadn't.

1022
01:53:19,207 --> 01:53:21,482
Hallie's your girl now.

1023
01:53:23,407 --> 01:53:26,558
Go on back in there
and take that nomination.

1024
01:53:26,607 --> 01:53:28,962
You taught her
how to read and write.

1025
01:53:29,007 --> 01:53:31,726
Now give her something
to read and write about!

1026
01:54:07,367 --> 01:54:11,155
Well, you know the rest of it.

1027
01:54:11,207 --> 01:54:14,483
I went to Washington,
and we won statehood.

1028
01:54:14,527 --> 01:54:17,678
I became the first governor.

1029
01:54:17,727 --> 01:54:22,801
Three terms as governor,
two terms in the Senate,

1030
01:54:22,847 --> 01:54:29,082
Ambassador to the Court of St James,
back again to the Senate,

1031
01:54:29,127 --> 01:54:33,882
and a man who,
with the snap of his fingers,

1032
01:54:33,927 --> 01:54:37,920
could be the next vice president
of the United States.

1033
01:54:42,367 --> 01:54:45,040
You're not going to use the story,
Mr Scott?

1034
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:47,726
No, sir.

1035
01:54:50,167 --> 01:54:53,000
This is the west, sir.

1036
01:54:53,047 --> 01:54:56,562
When the legend becomes fact,
print the legend.

1037
01:54:56,607 --> 01:54:58,962
He's right, Rance.

1038
01:55:19,607 --> 01:55:21,598
It's getting late, Hallie.

1039
01:55:25,087 --> 01:55:30,525
We'll keep in touch with you,
Pompey. I promise.

1040
01:55:30,567 --> 01:55:34,879
- But, Mr Rance...
- Pork chop money.

1041
01:55:53,207 --> 01:55:56,643
Hallie...

1042
01:55:56,687 --> 01:56:00,077
Hallie, would you be too sorry

1043
01:56:00,127 --> 01:56:05,440
if once I get the new
irrigation bill through,

1044
01:56:05,487 --> 01:56:11,756
would you be too sorry
if we just up and left Washington?

1045
01:56:11,807 --> 01:56:19,077
I sort of have a hankering
to come back here to live.

1046
01:56:19,967 --> 01:56:23,880
- Maybe open up a law office.
- Rance...

1047
01:56:25,047 --> 01:56:29,006
If you knew how often
I'd dreamed of it.

1048
01:56:29,047 --> 01:56:34,679
My roots are here.
I guess my heart is here.

1049
01:56:35,967 --> 01:56:38,197
Yes, let's come back.

1050
01:56:40,367 --> 01:56:44,406
Look at it.
It was once a wilderness.

1051
01:56:44,447 --> 01:56:48,281
Now it's a garden. Aren't you proud?

1052
01:56:51,967 --> 01:56:57,644
Hallie, who put the cactus roses
on Tom's coffin?

1053
01:56:58,607 --> 01:57:00,404
I did.

1054
01:57:06,847 --> 01:57:10,556
Here, I got a brand-new spittoon...
Cuspidor, Hallie.

1055
01:57:10,607 --> 01:57:14,520
and Luke the engineer's got a full
head of steam in this tar bucket.

1056
01:57:14,567 --> 01:57:18,242
We'll make 25 miles an hour
or bust a boiler trying.

1057
01:57:18,287 --> 01:57:23,919
And we wired ahead to Junction City.
They'll hold the Express.

1058
01:57:23,967 --> 01:57:27,482
In two days and two nights,
you'll be in Washington.

1059
01:57:27,527 --> 01:57:29,324
Thank you, Jason.

1060
01:57:29,367 --> 01:57:32,484
I'm going to write a letter
to the officials of this railroad

1061
01:57:32,527 --> 01:57:36,679
and thank them for their kindness
and for going to all this trouble.

1062
01:57:36,727 --> 01:57:38,524
You think nothing of it.

1063
01:57:38,567 --> 01:57:41,559
Nothing's too good for the man
who shot Liberty Valance.

1064
01:58:05,927 --> 01:58:08,919
