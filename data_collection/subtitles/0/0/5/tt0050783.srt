1
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:03,622
Go over there.

2
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:12,302
It's beautiful!
Come on!

3
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,893
Giorgio!

4
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,829
Help! Help!

5
00:03:48,174 --> 00:03:50,904
Help! Somebody's drowning!

6
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,658
Where's Romolo?

7
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:11,626
He went to City Hall.

8
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,992
To hell with City Hall!

9
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:17,895
It's a woman.

10
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,395
There she is!

11
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:23,074
Tino's not here either?

12
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,073
Is she trying to drown herself?

13
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,644
There she is.
Go in after her.

14
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:33,342
Jump! If she gets to the sewer
she won't come up again.

15
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,415
A woman's drowning!

16
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,724
You guys head her off.
I'll go in after her.

17
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,009
Pascello, run!
Come over here!

18
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:06,048
What are you doing? Not like that!
Turn her upside down!

19
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,879
Stefano, hurry up!

20
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:10,883
Where'd you fish her out?

21
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,389
Careful.
Hold her under the stomach.

22
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:15,026
She was drowning!

23
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:17,356
She probably slipped.
Mario saw her.

24
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:19,259
She musta slipped
and fell in.

25
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,400
- Did she jump off the bridge?
- No.

26
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:23,398
- Did she go under?
- Three times.

27
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,537
- At least seven times!
- Ten times!

28
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:30,142
She must have swallowed a lot.
We'll need some help. Stefano!

29
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:32,612
What happened?

30
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:39,281
- Faster with the arms!
- She lost a shoe.

31
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:43,516
I think she's dead.

32
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:51,992
Get the water out,
before it's too late.

33
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,497
Look how it's rushing out.
Move it, kids!

34
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:57,761
Wesaved her!

35
00:05:57,971 --> 00:05:59,666
Beat it!

36
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,870
Let's get Pompeo.
He never seen anyone drown before.

37
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:03,771
Look.

38
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,070
I don't wanna look.
I'm afraid.

39
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,282
Looks dead to me.

40
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,852
Dead bodies don't
throw up water.

41
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,579
She opened her eyes!

42
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,122
She opened her eyes!
Put her down.

43
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,022
We'll give her
artificial respiration.

44
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:24,696
She's bleeding.

45
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:26,957
It's just a scratch.

46
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:31,595
What she needs is brandy.

47
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,103
Brandy nothing!
What she needs is milk.

48
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:41,844
Quiet! She's coming to. You, with
the motorbike, go get some milk.

49
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:43,606
I'm outta gas.

50
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,817
Take it easy now.

51
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,755
You're all right.
You can thank the Holy Father.

52
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,184
You're fine.

53
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:53,855
Where's Giorgio?

54
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,425
What Giorgio?

55
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:02,632
Where are you going?

56
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,836
Who's she looking for?

57
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,472
- Wasn't she alone?
- Yes.

58
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:21,918
Who does he think he is?

59
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,719
Take it easy. Come here.

60
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:27,188
I'm going home.
Where are my shoes?

61
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,491
Here. There's only one.

62
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,534
She's got seven souls, like a cat.

63
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:37,396
See? She can hardly stand up.

64
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,504
Poor thing. She's in bad shape.

65
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,867
You were almost dead.

66
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:45,602
Leave me alone!
Let go of me!

67
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,669
Hey! We're the ones who saved you!

68
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:52,180
You saved me.
Now I wanna go home, okay?

69
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:55,679
Okay, suit yourself.
Go home. Good-bye.

70
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:00,059
Hi, Cabiria.

71
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:01,655
You know her?

72
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,056
Sure. She's Cabiria.

73
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,423
Where's she live?

74
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,827
On Via Cecilia.

75
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,390
She lives the life.

76
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:36,729
Giorgio! Open up! It's me!

77
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:40,959
It's me! Cabiria!

78
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:03,422
Wanda!

79
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,157
Wanda! Have you seen Giorgio?

80
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,455
What happened to you?

81
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,155
Mind your own business.
Did you see Giorgio?

82
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,630
- Which Giorgio?
- My Giorgio.

83
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:19,861
What happened to you?

84
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,177
What do you want from me?

85
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,135
What do youwant?

86
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,712
I don't want nothing.
Mind your own fat ass!

87
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:51,803
Go inside and dry yourself off.

88
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,768
I don't have the keys.

89
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:55,401
Where'd you put them?

90
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:56,939
In my purse.

91
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,236
Where's your purse?

92
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,849
Giorgio's got it.

93
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:09,515
We took a walk by the river and...

94
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:11,849
I fell in.

95
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:14,390
He got scared and ran away.

96
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,187
Cabiria! Open up!

97
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,328
Come on, open up.

98
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:24,867
I gotta sleep!

99
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,068
Tell me something.

100
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:37,173
How much did you have
in your purse? Answer me.

101
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,561
If you see Giorgio, I'm right here.

102
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,285
What are you doing?

103
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,092
You're right to stay home.

104
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,596
Go to bed and
get some sleep.

105
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,961
I'll see you later
when I get back.

106
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:36,707
Why didn't you take your aspirin?
Take it, it'll do you good.

107
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:40,276
You still here?
Aren't you tired of yakkin'?

108
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,004
Can't you see I had enough?

109
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,174
Get lost!

110
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,150
Who told you
we were friends?

111
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,116
Get lost, will you?

112
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,988
And don't come borrowing
my thermometer anymore!

113
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:57,285
Who's asking you for anything?
What a nut!

114
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:59,522
You're a sweetheart!

115
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:13,473
Someone would throw you in the
river for 40,000 lire?

116
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:16,443
Drown you for 40,000 lire?

117
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:19,583
Nowadays they'll do it for 5,000.

118
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:21,142
Someone who loves you?

119
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,452
What love?
You met him a month ago.

120
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:27,023
You don't know his name
or where he lives.

121
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,956
Can't you understand?
He pushed you in!

122
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:32,688
He pushed you in the river!

123
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,463
And you were lucky,
because if it had been me...

124
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:38,762
I'd have held your head under
myself! You nut!

125
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:40,703
Tell the cops!

126
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,931
I'm no stool pigeon!

127
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,711
Take my advice!
Report him!

128
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:52,984
But why? Why'd he do it?
I gave him everything.

129
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:57,122
I gave him everything he wanted.
He didn't have to do it.

130
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:07,795
I'm such a moron.

131
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,486
What if I died?

132
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,855
That's it! The party's over!

133
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,527
We're through! Finished!

134
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:12,823
Silk shirts! I'll give you silk shirts!

135
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:15,899
Find another jerk like me!

136
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:20,163
Look what I bought him!
A checked suit!

137
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:25,470
Camel-hair coat!
Never again! Never!

138
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:28,844
And who's gonna feed you now?
St. Peter?

139
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:31,106
Eternal love!

140
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:33,409
You dirty vitellone!

141
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,713
Go back to selling balloons!

142
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,288
I'll burn it all!

143
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:44,156
Chicken soup, veal chops.

144
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:47,396
You should drop dead!

145
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,212
This is the last time!
You'll never see me here again.

146
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:13,152
This is my last evening.
I shouldn't even be seen with you!

147
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,754
Look how classy I am.

148
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:20,831
You look like Moby Dick to me.

149
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,967
How dare you!

150
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,935
Know where you belong?
In the nuthouse!

151
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:30,940
Use your eyes!
Take a good look at me!

152
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:35,011
Look at me. A grande dame.

153
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,686
She gets worse all the time.

154
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,217
They oughta put her away.

155
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,549
That's how you'll end up!

156
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,315
And that's the heater.

157
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:49,790
- This car's got everything.
- Even Coca-Cola.

158
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:52,362
- Gimme a ride?
- This ain't no tank!

159
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:54,362
- Get out!
- I'm not getting out.

160
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,057
Come on, move!

161
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,132
- Why should I?
- I'm taking Wanda for a ride.

162
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:01,967
You don't know how to drive.

163
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:05,641
It's my car. I can do what I want
with it. Get out.

164
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,837
I'll visit you in the hospital.
This I gotta see.

165
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,480
Why not the bigger model?

166
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:14,743
Another one! What do you know about
cars? You're always in the bushes!

167
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:20,220
You're always on two wheels!

168
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,855
Here comes the psycho again.

169
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:29,891
- Bye, handsome.
- Bye, sweetie.

170
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,832
Remember to come see
your princess.

171
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,571
Cute! Real fancy!

172
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:43,077
Me, I'd have picked a grey one.

173
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,647
It's a fancier color.
But this one's cute.

174
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,615
You're gonna kill the battery!

175
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,118
Wanda, get out.
I don't wanna fight tonight.

176
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:53,689
Neither do I, you fanatic.

177
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,393
Still, a Fiat is a Fiat.

178
00:16:56,562 --> 00:17:00,623
With a car, life's a lot different.
You sit up there, high up...

179
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:05,031
and you signal right, left,
vroom-vroom.

180
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:10,004
People think you're well off,
a secretary, a daddy's girl.

181
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,872
The men all chase you.
It feels great!

182
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,843
- Listen to her!
- What?

183
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:19,211
I know how she got that car!

184
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,777
That cokehead!

185
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:21,853
Wait!

186
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:23,689
Stay right here!

187
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,914
- Let me get out!
- Stay!

188
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,932
You're dancing, Cabiria?

189
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:39,465
You're in luck!
I'm the best dancer in Rome.

190
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,605
Come on!

191
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:50,079
Now she found another
deadbeat to say "I love you."

192
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:55,185
One who'll send her off begging.

193
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:58,913
Get off the street, dear,
or I'll have you arrested.

194
00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:03,788
Here I am, gentlemen!
Here I am!

195
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,596
Just as well.
Who needs you!

196
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:13,236
Where you going with
the car? To the old-age home?

197
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:16,131
Maybe if you were 20 years younger!

198
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,032
Filthy flea bag!

199
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:21,645
You're just jealous!

200
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:26,450
Hear that, Cabiria?
She can't get away with that!

201
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:29,917
Look how you'll end up,
you lousy whore!

202
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:34,819
"Please, be kind.
Have a heart!"

203
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:38,530
"Please, for my Giorgio's sake!"

204
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:42,959
Do it! Poke her eyes out!

205
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,433
Wanda, here we go again.

206
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,674
Forza, Cabiria!

207
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:02,249
Never mind her!
Hit her low, in the belly!

208
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:05,421
Don't stop them!
It's too much fun!

209
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,351
Stop it before the cops come!

210
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:12,760
I'll kill her!

211
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:15,327
Let go of me!

212
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:20,803
Get her in the car.

213
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:23,666
Get her away!

214
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,278
- Leave me alone!
- Get inside!

215
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:29,307
I'll punch you a new face!

216
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,681
It's not over yet!

217
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:41,325
She ruined my face!

218
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,758
Forget about her.

219
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,592
You're scared of me, right?

220
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,235
You lousy loser!

221
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,271
Have a smoke.

222
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,814
Where you wanna go?

223
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:06,406
To Via Veneto.

224
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,985
Via Veneto?
Think you're the Empress Poppea?

225
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,959
Listen, Cabiria, you and me oughta
have a talk one of these days.

226
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,788
You're not doing it right.

227
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:19,828
Who's watching over you?

228
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,300
Look at Marisa and me.

229
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,492
She's safe wherever she goes.

230
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,104
Nobody in Rome would harm
a hair on her head.

231
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,099
You know why?

232
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:31,833
Let me out.

233
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:37,341
What do you expect
to do here?

234
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,677
Girls fight for spots on
Via Veneto and Villa Borghese.

235
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,755
Cabiria, why not find yourself
a serious man? Respectable, like me.

236
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:47,017
I don't need one.

237
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:49,820
- I say you do.
- I say I don't!

238
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:54,193
Why should I slave
for filthy pigs like you?

239
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:55,594
Let's drop it.

240
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:58,100
Yeah, drop it.
Better let me out.

241
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,271
Yeah, it's better.

242
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,070
So long!

243
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:06,763
Moron! Degenerate! Go take a walk
on the Passeggiata Archeologica!

244
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,988
Can't I look?

245
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,999
Know how gorgeous you are?

246
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,693
Get going.

247
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,501
Oh, yeah? We'll I'm staying
right here! See?

248
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:26,351
Sorry.

249
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:28,544
Are you blind?

250
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,053
Jessie!

251
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:36,789
Jessie! How can this happen?

252
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,326
Alberto Lazzari!

253
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,992
Jessie, I don't want to get upset.

254
00:23:46,004 --> 00:23:47,266
Jessie, cut it out!

255
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,764
Let go!

256
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:52,938
Don't make me lose my temper.
Come back inside.

257
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,476
Give me the keys.

258
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:58,980
- Go inside. Don't be stupid.
- Don't you touch me, you pig!

259
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:04,789
Move over. Let me in.
Where are you going? Where?

260
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:07,787
- Do I get the keys or not?
- No!

261
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:13,059
- You're not getting out!
- You're hurting me. Let go!

262
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,058
Jessie, dear, listen.

263
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:20,635
Listen one last time.

264
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,933
- There's no more to say.
- I'm tired. You're exhausting!

265
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,737
- Let go! You're ruining my fur.
- I bought it!

266
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:28,173
You louse!

267
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,677
- Wait a second.
- What for?

268
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,276
You can go.

269
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:35,146
Lousy second-rate ham!

270
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,126
Listen,Jessie. If you don't
come back, it's over!

271
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:43,688
Fine! It's over!

272
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:47,388
Finished!
At last! So much the better.

273
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,993
Thanks, thanks,Jessie.

274
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,461
What do you want?
Go away!

275
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:16,786
Hey, you!

276
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,721
I'm talking to you!

277
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:24,658
Get in.

278
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,459
Who, me?

279
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:28,467
Yes, you. Hurry up. Get in.

280
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,312
Fast!

281
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:48,950
Close it.

282
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:22,616
Get out.

283
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:23,885
But why?

284
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:25,560
Come on, get out.

285
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,460
What's it gonna be, Mr. Mustache?

286
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:34,196
What's going on here?

287
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:36,298
Get out, get in, get in, get out!

288
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:38,532
Make up your mind!

289
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:42,303
Come on. Let's have some fun.

290
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,140
- He said to go in.
- So go in.

291
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:42,203
How are you, sir? How about a table?
Tonight's show is exceptional.

292
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,174
Your umbrella, Signora?

293
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:55,750
Right this way, Signora.

294
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:13,994
Who's that?

295
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:19,041
May I help you?

296
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:23,314
Sit over here. Come on.

297
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,173
Please.

298
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:32,724
Sit over there.

299
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:17,061
Alberto!
Monica.

300
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:23,102
What are you up to, Alberto?
Are you shooting?

301
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:25,172
- Yes.
- No need to introduce him!

302
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:27,004
Pleased to meet you.

303
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,873
Yesterday the Americans
gave me a screen test.

304
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:31,906
It turned out fantastic.

305
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,211
I have a 1 6-millimeter print at home
if you want to see it.

306
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:53,093
Ladies and gentlemen, that was part
one of our show. Before you dance...

307
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:56,797
I'd like to salute and applaud
an illustrious guest who is...

308
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:58,640
honoring us with his presence.

309
00:29:59,578 --> 00:30:01,944
Must I applaud too, Alberto?

310
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:05,673
Okay, boys! Mambo number 26!

311
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:14,291
Do me a favor,
come to our table.

312
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:17,360
A bunch of my friends
would love to meet you.

313
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:19,393
- Come on, Alberto.
- I can't.

314
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:21,996
I'm with the lady.

315
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:24,524
Let's dance.

316
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:50,384
Mambo. The world turns
around the mambo.

317
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:51,619
What a mambo.

318
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,198
Oh, boy! What a mambo!

319
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,771
If you wanna be with your friends,
don't mind me.

320
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:47,285
What?

321
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,578
Don't let me keep you
from your friends.

322
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:51,482
That's enough. Let's go.

323
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:53,982
Good night, Commendatore.

324
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,946
Get in. Hurry up!

325
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,380
- Did you eat?
- No. Well, a little bit around 8:00.

326
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:24,755
- Let's get some supper.
- What?

327
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:25,945
Let's have supper.

328
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:29,683
Good. Where are we going?

329
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:30,985
My house.

330
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,326
Wait! Wait a second!
Hey, Fancy Pants!

331
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:37,625
I'm talking to you!

332
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:39,158
Look at me!

333
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:44,068
Look who I'm with!
Up yours!

334
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,303
Know who this is?

335
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:21,874
- Did anyone call?
- Nobody, Commendatore.

336
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:25,705
- What do you mean nobody?
- Nobody called.

337
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:29,886
- Were you awake or sleeping?
- Nobody called. I was here.

338
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:31,055
All right.

339
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,915
Supper for two in my room.

340
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:38,022
If Miss Jessie calls, I'm asleep.
If she insists, I'm asleep.

341
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:40,754
If she stillinsists, I'm still asleep!

342
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:46,066
We'll eat upstairs.
What's your name?

343
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:48,936
What?

344
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:51,936
Come on, move.

345
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:12,220
What? Another dog?

346
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,379
Look at these!

347
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:34,585
You got fish too?

348
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:38,322
Yes.
Now, where did I put it?

349
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:45,318
- Leave it for the maid.
- But it'll get wrinkled.

350
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:51,333
Idiot! What made me do it?

351
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:55,630
Did you ever see an idiot?
Well, you're looking at one.

352
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:57,433
Just leave it!

353
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:19,887
Come.

354
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:35,236
What was your name again?

355
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,450
Where are you from?

356
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:44,488
What?

357
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:48,520
- Where do you come from?
- From Rome. Piazza Risorgimento.

358
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,396
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

359
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:12,905
You like it?

360
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,918
Kind of.

361
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:18,512
It's not really my thing.

362
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:21,721
It's not my taste, but, yes.

363
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,951
Beethoven's Fifth.

364
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:28,529
I love it.

365
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:32,124
Come in.

366
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:47,310
Leave it there.
I'll take care of it. Go.

367
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,552
And close the door.

368
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,864
Let's see what he brought us.

369
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,293
Caviar, lobster.

370
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,062
Help yourself. Eat.
I'm not in the mood.

371
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:13,072
Help yourself.
I don't know if you like it.

372
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:17,580
1 949...

373
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,113
1 949...

374
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:25,017
Take that off.
It's hot in here.

375
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,030
Guess I tore it.

376
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:39,625
Where do you live?

377
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:41,433
Past the gas station.

378
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:44,039
- Where?
- On the road to Ostia.

379
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:47,133
- You come to Via Veneto?
- Via Veneto? Me?

380
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:50,643
I work the Passeggiata Archeologica.
Much more convenient.

381
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:51,646
Why?

382
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,407
I'm on the Cilia.
Subway takes me right there.

383
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:56,745
There's another girl,
my friend Wanda.

384
00:37:56,988 --> 00:38:00,617
She lives there too.
But I don't bother with the others.

385
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:03,793
The others sleep under the arches
in Caracalla.

386
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:06,724
Mind you, I have my own house...

387
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:10,958
with water, electricity, bottled gas,
every convenience. I got everything.

388
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:13,136
Even a thermometer.

389
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:15,299
See this one here?

390
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:18,604
She never, ever
slept under an arch.

391
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:20,669
Well, maybe once.

392
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:21,871
Or twice.

393
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:26,249
Of course, my house is...

394
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,019
nothing like this.

395
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:32,414
But it's enough for me.
I like it.

396
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:41,463
Eat. Eat something.

397
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:47,629
What's wrong?

398
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:50,534
Damn it! I know who you are!

399
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:53,810
I know!
Can I say it?

400
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:55,868
Can I?

401
00:38:56,447 --> 00:39:00,281
Alberto Lazzari! I knew you
right away! I saw all your movies.

402
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:01,952
Very nice!

403
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:03,816
Which is your favorite?

404
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:05,649
Well, the last one.

405
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:10,123
You had a costume with all that
stuff, then Vittorio Scraman came...

406
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,825
pushed the door open,
"Fermi tutti!"

407
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:14,992
Then it was his daughter.

408
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:17,297
That wasn't me.

409
00:39:17,502 --> 00:39:19,094
What do you mean?

410
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:23,300
You're as good-looking
as your house.

411
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:28,044
Bring the glasses here.

412
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:39,356
- Champagne.
- Sit down.

413
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:12,519
What's wrong now?

414
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,816
Who's gonna believe this
when I tell 'em?

415
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:19,719
They already think I'm full of it.

416
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:22,561
I might not believe it myself
tomorrow.

417
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,530
You have to do me a favor.
Give me a picture...

418
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:29,673
and write, "Cabiria was here
at my house-- Alberto Lazzari."

419
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:32,574
"Cabiria Ceccarelli was at my
house."

420
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,242
Write it just like that.

421
00:40:36,848 --> 00:40:38,042
Now let's eat.

422
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:39,840
And you eat too.

423
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:41,375
An olive.

424
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:45,889
Should I open it?

425
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:51,418
Chicken! Some chicken breast
to chase away the blues.

426
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,189
Here's your plate.

427
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:58,534
If you want to play more
of that music, I'd like it too.

428
00:40:58,803 --> 00:41:00,361
And what's this?

429
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:02,666
I saw it in a movie once.

430
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:06,509
- Commendatore.
- Yes, Davide.

431
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:09,205
- It'sSignorina Jessie.
- I said, tell her I'm sleeping.

432
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,338
- She's here.
- What?

433
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:13,175
- She's downstairs.
-Just don't let her in.

434
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,749
She's already in.
She's coming up.

435
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,651
Idiot!

436
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,892
Alberto, open up.

437
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,928
- Who is it?
- Don't be stupid! Open up!

438
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:36,129
So? Open up.

439
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:39,102
It's very important.

440
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,368
One moment.

441
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,145
- The picture!
- Oh, yes. Hurry up!

442
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,088
Alberto, will you open up?

443
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:53,416
Go in the bathroom a minute.

444
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:55,751
Yes. I'll get rid of her. Hurry!

445
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,451
I'm not leaving.
I'll stay here all night!

446
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:01,427
- Quiet, don't move.
- Open up.

447
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,798
Alberto, please open the door.

448
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:10,263
Open up, you bastard!

449
00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:14,308
What do you want?

450
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,754
What's on your mind?

451
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,590
I'm tired.
I have to be up early tomorrow.

452
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:33,931
I'm working. You know that, right?

453
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:37,165
I'm thirsty. Give me a drink.

454
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:39,368
- What?
- I'm thirsty!

455
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:46,671
Now what?

456
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:50,541
I can't go on this way!

457
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:53,716
Well, neither can I!

458
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:57,151
Your jealousy
is morbid, unbearable.

459
00:42:57,355 --> 00:43:00,188
I'm tired of it.
I can't take it any more.

460
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:03,355
Let's call it quits while we're
still friends, okay?

461
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:07,829
No. That's too easy!
I'm not going anywhere!

462
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:13,763
Jessie, don't do this.
Get some sleep.

463
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:15,871
You're tired and
I'm falling apart.

464
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:18,098
We'll call each other tomorrow.

465
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:41,496
- I know you've stopped loving me.
- Who told you that?

466
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:43,496
You've stopped loving me.

467
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:46,598
- Admit it.
- I'd never say such a thing.

468
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:49,897
Admit it, and I'll never
bother you again.

469
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:51,506
But I'd be lying.

470
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,776
Even if we saw each other
occasionally...

471
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:58,707
every two or three days,
I'd be happy.

472
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,943
Why so seldom?
We could be together much more.

473
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:06,317
- Every day?
- Yes, every day.

474
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:11,188
But stop being so jealous. Is it my
fault that women always look at me?

475
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:14,387
But you're ugly!

476
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:24,191
How do I get outta here?

477
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:54,383
Hey, Cabiria. Alberto Lazzari's
been lookin' for you!

478
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:57,694
I'm not even talking to you!

479
00:46:57,895 --> 00:47:00,227
- Don't listen to her.
- Who's listening?

480
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:01,855
Hey, Cabiria, there's Limpy.

481
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,533
There's a winner.

482
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:06,562
Hey, you old lecher!

483
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:10,702
Homesick for jail?

484
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:13,809
Come on, Cabiria,
let's have a good laugh.

485
00:47:17,515 --> 00:47:21,747
Why'd you bring him along?
Guess a weed never dies.

486
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:24,010
The Madonna might
have mercy on my uncle.

487
00:47:24,155 --> 00:47:25,122
What mercy?

488
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:28,191
The pilgrims of the Madonna del
Divino Amore just went by.

489
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:29,757
I don't believe that stuff.

490
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:32,857
- Don't you believe in miracles?
- Not me.

491
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:35,224
Should we go there on Sunday?

492
00:47:35,432 --> 00:47:38,299
We'll all have
something to ask for.

493
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:41,130
You goin', Cabiria?

494
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:43,602
Me? I don't know. I'll think about it.
Besides...

495
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:46,902
what would I ask for?
I've got everything.

496
00:47:47,077 --> 00:47:49,910
I'll even be done
with the mortgage soon.

497
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:54,243
But I might go anyway.
I haven't said no.

498
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,450
We'll see.

499
00:47:56,854 --> 00:47:59,982
Think the Madonna would
waste a miracle on him?

500
00:48:00,524 --> 00:48:04,119
Funny, huh? The Madonna knows
how you made your dough.

501
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:06,761
Selling coke
and pimping women.

502
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:09,194
I'm going to see the Madonna...

503
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,868
and I know exactly
what I'll ask for.

504
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:14,766
Don't make fun of stuff like that.

505
00:48:16,974 --> 00:48:18,805
You really want to go?

506
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:24,580
What'll you ask for?

507
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:27,848
I'm talking to you.
What'll you ask for?

508
00:49:37,554 --> 00:49:40,819
Hey, you! Shorty!

509
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:43,690
Wanna lift?

510
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:09,677
A shortcut.
He calls this a shortcut.

511
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:12,619
I've been walking an hour.

512
00:50:12,823 --> 00:50:14,791
Who knows where I am?

513
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,502
You live in the caves too?

514
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:04,736
I've never seen you before.

515
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:06,241
I've got my own house.

516
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:26,729
Gorgiano! Gorgiano!
It's me. Come up.

517
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,201
How are you doing?

518
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:37,238
Not so bad, thank you, sir.

519
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:40,341
And where's Pietro?
Sleeping?

520
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:43,740
They took him to the hospital
two days ago.

521
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:46,916
Said he was in bad shape.

522
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:50,518
- And, you, what do you need?
- Whatever you want, thanks, sir.

523
00:51:51,054 --> 00:51:53,079
Here's a blanket. Is that all right?

524
00:51:53,357 --> 00:51:55,188
What hospital did they take Pietro to?

525
00:51:55,392 --> 00:51:57,292
To the Fratebenefratelli.

526
00:51:57,528 --> 00:52:01,328
All right, I'll visit him
if I have time.

527
00:52:13,577 --> 00:52:16,910
Hey, Dark Hair.
Who is that guy?

528
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,789
But who is he?
With some charity?

529
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:29,122
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

530
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:43,103
Can I help you?

531
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:47,469
Going back to Rome later?

532
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:53,980
Can you give me a lift?

533
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:55,510
Yes, later.

534
00:53:07,164 --> 00:53:08,153
Elsa!

535
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:14,603
Ah, caro!

536
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:18,601
I was expecting you Saturday,
but you came today!

537
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:23,075
I was just thinking yesterday,
"He comes every nine or ten days.

538
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,149
"He came Wednesday,
so he'll show up Saturday!"

539
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:32,482
Bomba! But I know this one!

540
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:35,957
Bomba, you live here?

541
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:40,185
I wish I had everything I used to.

542
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:43,332
A place in Rome, a place in Ostia.

543
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:48,028
Showered with gifts!
Money in the bank!Jewels! Gold!

544
00:53:48,238 --> 00:53:50,229
I had five kilos of gold!

545
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:54,240
She's not lying, you know.
Now who'd believe it?

546
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:56,411
But this one in her day--

547
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:59,582
Here they don't even
make me comb my hair.

548
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:02,650
But if I wear a low-cut blouse...

549
00:54:02,853 --> 00:54:05,651
and the white earrings, then... ha!

550
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,555
Come, come, Elsa. Take this.

551
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:11,719
Oh! Look at the sweets you brought!

552
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:14,692
And only for me!
None for the others!

553
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,866
Give it to me to hide.

554
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:19,797
The one with the chocolate!

555
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:24,872
Pignoli!Look at the pignoli!
Like rainfall!

556
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:27,976
Thank you, caro, thank you!

557
00:54:34,217 --> 00:54:37,448
And when will you be back?
When?

558
00:54:40,624 --> 00:54:44,583
God protect you from evil, my son.

559
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:55,229
Of course...

560
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:58,939
there's lots of starving people
in Rome, eh?

561
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:07,409
You drive around at night a lot?

562
00:55:09,286 --> 00:55:11,754
Not as much as needed.

563
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:20,720
How about during the day?

564
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:24,960
No, in the daytime,
the poor wander about.

565
00:55:25,202 --> 00:55:26,863
How would I find them?

566
00:55:28,605 --> 00:55:30,197
Go figure.

567
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:35,303
Me, I'm out at night too,
and I've never met you.

568
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:39,713
But how'd you get the idea...

569
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,941
the idea of doing this job?

570
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:46,087
I don't even know myself.
Like that. Little by little.

571
00:55:50,027 --> 00:55:53,519
We're here. There's your tram.

572
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:04,230
Do you live far from here?

573
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:07,433
About 1 9 kilometers,
on the way to Ostia.

574
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:10,638
What's your name?

575
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,571
Maria Ceccarelli.

576
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,078
Are you alone?

577
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:18,850
My father and mother
died when I was little.

578
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:20,785
I came to Rome later.

579
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,690
Now go and get some sleep.

580
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:43,309
So l--

581
00:56:44,548 --> 00:56:47,210
Arrivederci.
Go ahead, tell me.

582
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:50,551
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

583
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,071
Don Vincenzo,
the group from Rieti is here.

584
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:38,697
Get your prickly pears!
Fresh prickly pears!

585
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:40,631
Gimme a hand, Maurizio.

586
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:58,617
Wanda, get a load of this crowd!

587
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:10,429
There's the candle guy.
Come on, Uncle.

588
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:20,542
How much for the candles?

589
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:24,077
Take your pick.
I got some for 50, 1 00, 1 50.

590
00:58:24,314 --> 00:58:25,906
The biggest you got.

591
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:27,582
We'll take two each.

592
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:30,446
Wanda, the candles! Over here!

593
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:31,984
Are these all right?

594
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:35,252
I just want one. I'll pay for it myself.
Maybe I'll pay you later.

595
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,153
No, I'll pay for them all.

596
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:41,892
- What'll I do with it now?
- Stupid!

597
00:58:43,366 --> 00:58:46,494
How much altogether?

598
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,144
Make way! Sick man here!
Let us through!

599
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:06,778
So young!

600
00:59:08,124 --> 00:59:10,092
We're over here! Wait for us!

601
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:14,024
We're gonna get photos!

602
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:18,126
- Come, Cabiria. They're calling us.
- I'm coming.

603
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:19,325
Where's Wanda?

604
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,870
Wanda, come on!

605
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:23,538
Marisa!

606
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:30,168
Get lost!

607
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:32,112
With that nose
you want a photo?

608
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:34,340
Who's takin' the picture?
How much?

609
00:59:35,218 --> 00:59:36,583
Now what do we do?

610
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,085
You need to confess. Down there,
where it says confessione.

611
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:42,188
I already confessed yesterday.

612
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:43,986
Watch out! He's a cripple!

613
01:00:12,222 --> 01:00:15,953
I'm gonna ask for mercy
from the Madonna too. Like you.

614
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:17,990
What am I asking for?

615
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:19,661
You don't remember?

616
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:22,626
I could ask for a villa
in Peripli.

617
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:26,564
That's not what you said!

618
01:00:27,003 --> 01:00:28,265
Don't you remember?

619
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:31,269
I'll ask for whatever I feel like.

620
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:35,168
But you said you'd ask--

621
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:37,403
I changed my mind.

622
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:46,989
Why are you talking like that?

623
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,556
See? You made
my candle go out.

624
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:54,789
Thirty masses at 1 ,000 each.
That's 30,000.

625
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:56,356
I gave them 35.

626
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:58,966
Yeah, you did okay.
You never know.

627
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,437
How's the act of contrition go?
I forgot.

628
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:11,239
"My Lord, I repent
with all my heart."

629
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:13,973
- Yeah. What's after that?
- It's written in the confessional.

630
01:01:14,184 --> 01:01:17,642
Wait here.
We can't go in together!

631
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:19,245
That's enough for now!

632
01:01:20,523 --> 01:01:23,856
Use the other entrance!

633
01:01:28,865 --> 01:01:31,231
Take it easy. Don't push!

634
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:33,368
I'm sick. I can't help it.

635
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:36,536
He's sick too. Can't you see that?

636
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:41,900
Careful, Uncle.

637
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,973
- There's the altar, Uncle.
- I can't.

638
01:01:46,182 --> 01:01:49,117
I can't go on. I can't move.

639
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:52,118
I'll hold you till we're at the altar.

640
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:53,344
I gotta rest.

641
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:56,286
Rosie, come here.
I think he's gonna pass out.

642
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:59,723
Try again, Uncle.
We're almost there.

643
01:02:00,797 --> 01:02:04,062
Everyone has a secret agony.

644
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:07,061
Everyone has a wish
for You to fulfill.

645
01:02:07,337 --> 01:02:10,898
Open your heart to the suffering,
O Holy Virgin!

646
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:15,840
Mercy, Madonna!

647
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:19,174
Call out with all your hearts,
"Viva Maria!"

648
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:27,949
- Heal me, Madonna!
- Make me well, Madonna!

649
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:45,593
Wanda, over here!

650
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,840
Stay close.
What happens next?

651
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,134
I don't know!

652
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:57,279
You oughta hear my heart beating.
I'm shaking.

653
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,108
I feel so strange, Wanda.

654
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:10,656
Now all kneel and pray.

655
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:21,168
Amleto, will the Madonna
bestow Her grace on me?

656
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:23,839
I think so.

657
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:28,804
Now approach the altar
of the Virgin.

658
01:04:29,012 --> 01:04:33,972
Look into Her sweet eyes,
and in Her glance, each one of you...

659
01:04:34,317 --> 01:04:39,084
will feel the light of hope
turned on in your heart.

660
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:02,440
Madonna, help me...

661
01:05:03,313 --> 01:05:05,144
to change my life.

662
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:09,109
Bestow your grace on me too.

663
01:05:12,855 --> 01:05:14,482
Make me change my life.

664
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:17,755
- Uncle, now!
- I'm afraid.

665
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:20,428
Drop the crutches.
She'll have mercy on you.

666
01:05:20,597 --> 01:05:21,689
I'm afraid!

667
01:05:21,764 --> 01:05:22,753
I'm holding you!

668
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:29,071
Madonna, I'm a sinner.

669
01:05:29,138 --> 01:05:30,696
A worm of the earth.

670
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,876
Have mercy on me, Madonna.
Don't leave me!

671
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:09,105
Lost your tongue?
Have a drink.

672
01:06:09,345 --> 01:06:12,280
Careful, Wanda.
One glass and she's smashed.

673
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:13,845
What are you doing?

674
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,509
- I'm thinking.
- About what?

675
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:19,153
- What did she say?
- She says she's thinking.

676
01:06:19,322 --> 01:06:23,418
Too much thinking
will make your head explode.

677
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:28,059
Look at those delinquents!
Stop with the damn ball!

678
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:29,789
They're doing it on purpose!

679
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:31,627
I'll fix 'em!

680
01:06:40,777 --> 01:06:43,439
Next time I'll kick it
the other way!

681
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:54,188
You wanna stay here by yourselves?
Uncle and I will leave.Just say so.

682
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:57,052
- Why should we want to?
- What's wrong with you?

683
01:06:59,796 --> 01:07:01,991
- What if we wanted to?
- What's the matter, Cabiria?

684
01:07:02,098 --> 01:07:05,090
Hey! Come over here
and get your ball!

685
01:07:05,268 --> 01:07:08,101
Come over here
if you want it!

686
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,069
Go get her.
She can't even walk.

687
01:07:12,275 --> 01:07:15,108
I'm not gonna tangle with her.
She'll manage.

688
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,178
This music's boring!
Let's rock!

689
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:20,279
What are you doing, you nut?

690
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:25,018
We haven't changed.

691
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:29,680
Nobody's changed!

692
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:34,128
We're all the same as before,
just like the cripple.

693
01:07:34,497 --> 01:07:37,694
What do you want to change,
Cabiria?

694
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:43,133
You think this is the end?

695
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,536
You know what I'm gonna do?

696
01:07:46,709 --> 01:07:50,577
I'm gonna sell the house.
Everything. I'm leaving.

697
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,416
Good-bye, you guys.
I'm through with all this!

698
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:56,251
Where'll you go?

699
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:59,682
Where? Think I'm like you?

700
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:03,287
I know where I can go. I know.

701
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,391
Just look at those little nuns!

702
01:08:08,998 --> 01:08:12,729
Where you going
with that banner?

703
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:15,631
Looking for snails?

704
01:08:15,705 --> 01:08:16,967
Why'd you make her drink?

705
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:19,530
I made her drink?

706
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:25,080
Did the Madonna give you mercy?

707
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:27,549
Did she?

708
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:30,385
Cabiria! You wanna get us arrested?

709
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:33,855
Amleto, look at her!

710
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:34,990
What?

711
01:08:35,224 --> 01:08:36,384
Bring her back!

712
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:39,551
Leave me alone!
I wanna listen. Go on playing!

713
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,566
Come here, kids!
Come enjoy yourselves!

714
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:47,198
Come dance with us!

715
01:08:47,403 --> 01:08:49,598
Forget about your banner!

716
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:57,042
Why do you always butt in?
Get lost!

717
01:08:58,448 --> 01:09:01,781
Cabiria!
You're in no condition for this!

718
01:09:01,951 --> 01:09:04,852
- Leave me alone!
- You're blind drunk!

719
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:08,512
Who's drunk?
What do you know?

720
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:09,144
Is the show any good?
Hey! I asked you a question!

721
01:10:09,385 --> 01:10:11,546
You want me to say it stinks?

722
01:10:41,951 --> 01:10:45,580
As you can see, ladies and
gentlemen, my assistant's head...

723
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:49,753
has been completely
impaled by the daggers.

724
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:54,287
There's no doubt
that his head must be...

725
01:10:54,597 --> 01:10:56,394
soaked in blood.

726
01:10:56,532 --> 01:11:01,333
You'll be amazed to see, instead,
that his head has disappeared!

727
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:15,050
In the second part
of our show, we'll feature...

728
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:17,651
experiments with magnetism,
hypnotism and auto-suggestion.

729
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:22,051
Would anyone in the audience
care to volunteer? Prego, Signori!

730
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,622
I will!

731
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:33,194
Come right up.
Don't be afraid.

732
01:11:33,402 --> 01:11:36,064
There's absolutely no danger.

733
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:46,413
We now need a representative
of the fair sex.

734
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:48,707
- How about you, Signorina?
- Who, me?

735
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:51,176
Yes, you! Good! Come up.
Be brave!

736
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:53,611
No, I don't want to.

737
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:57,120
Would you leave those young men
up there all alone?

738
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:58,588
You go, then!

739
01:11:58,794 --> 01:12:00,762
Come on, chickie!
We need a laugh.

740
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:03,431
Wanna laugh?

741
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:05,330
Just look in the mirror!

742
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:08,101
Come on, Signorina,
don't make us beg.

743
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:10,261
Should I come and get you?

744
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:13,202
I'll come and get you.

745
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:16,242
Don't be afraid.
We're all good friends.

746
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:17,772
They're all tricks.

747
01:12:18,014 --> 01:12:20,778
- Will you come?
- Sure! I'm coming.

748
01:12:24,153 --> 01:12:25,916
Think I'm scared?

749
01:12:25,988 --> 01:12:28,252
It's all fixed anyway.

750
01:12:28,457 --> 01:12:32,393
There's no reason to be afraid.
You've showed how brave you are.

751
01:12:32,595 --> 01:12:37,123
Come, you'll be fine.
Now, let's enjoy ourselves.

752
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,066
Oh, I'm so forgetful!
It's really unforgivable!

753
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:46,469
I completely forgot that
Signorina Elvira is still inside.

754
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,980
Oh, this heat!
You're hot too, aren't you?

755
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:58,118
How about a nice boat ride?
Does anybody here get seasick?

756
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,754
I was on the Isle of Elba
as a kid.

757
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,890
You barely got to Ostia.

758
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:06,926
Nobody here gets seasick?
That's very good.

759
01:13:07,129 --> 01:13:09,063
Ah, here's our boat.

760
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:12,928
We named her Intrepidbecause
she always defies the waves.

761
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:15,797
Come on, boys.
Don't make me beg you.

762
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:17,495
Signorina, you stay here.

763
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:22,575
The boat is waiting. The sea is calm,
and the weather is fine.

764
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,469
I'm getting out of here!

765
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,011
Where are you going?

766
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:30,113
Damn, he's good!
He zapped him!

767
01:13:39,662 --> 01:13:40,788
Look into my eyes!

768
01:13:47,737 --> 01:13:51,070
Take the oars
and start rowing.

769
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:01,246
The sea is calm, transparent.
Feel the breeze.

770
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:05,818
Enjoy filling your lungs with air
saturated with salt and iodine.

771
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:07,854
Dolphins!

772
01:14:08,624 --> 01:14:10,888
Boy, look at 'em jump!

773
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:14,019
One of you doesn't feel so good.

774
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:16,528
Things are looking bad, boys.

775
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:19,496
It's the open sea now.
The waves are swelling.

776
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:21,499
Hear the wind whistling.

777
01:14:22,905 --> 01:14:23,997
It's a hurricane!

778
01:14:25,474 --> 01:14:27,465
Help! Hold the rudder!

779
01:14:33,082 --> 01:14:36,643
It's every man for himself!

780
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:46,617
Mamma mia bella!
I'm drowning!

781
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:05,013
- Scared, weren't you?
- You'd have been too!

782
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:07,681
You were plenty scared!

783
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:11,252
Where are you going?

784
01:15:12,087 --> 01:15:13,782
- You mean me?
- Yes.

785
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:16,024
- Isn't it over?
- No.

786
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:19,626
It's not over.
You'd leave me here all alone?

787
01:15:20,062 --> 01:15:21,723
What's he want now?

788
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:23,555
Signora or signorina?

789
01:15:27,803 --> 01:15:31,102
- Did you have fun watching?
- Not really.

790
01:15:31,307 --> 01:15:35,107
I'd like to talk with you
a moment. Come here.

791
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:38,310
- Are you from Rome?
- Yeah, I live in Rome.

792
01:15:40,616 --> 01:15:44,916
In what part of town?
Colonna? Parioli? Prati?

793
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:46,288
In Prati.

794
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:52,954
Come on, be honest with me.
Where do you live?

795
01:15:53,696 --> 01:15:55,186
In Borgata San Francesco.

796
01:16:03,873 --> 01:16:05,306
What's so funny?

797
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:08,374
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're just joking.

798
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:13,105
So, you're not married,
but you'd like to be.

799
01:16:13,682 --> 01:16:15,149
Why should I get married?

800
01:16:15,684 --> 01:16:18,152
- I'm no dope.
- Who'd marry her!

801
01:16:18,988 --> 01:16:22,048
All girls want to get married.

802
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:26,591
I know a nice young man
who'd be happy to marry you.

803
01:16:26,662 --> 01:16:27,651
Me?

804
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:30,855
He's rich, handsome,
rides a horse and drives a Ferrari.

805
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,762
Let's see if we can arrange it.

806
01:16:33,936 --> 01:16:35,927
What type of work
do you do?

807
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:37,538
She's a countess!

808
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:44,535
Listen, I'm fine the way I am.
I got everything.

809
01:16:44,847 --> 01:16:46,542
And now I'm leaving.

810
01:16:49,885 --> 01:16:51,250
I don't need anything!

811
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,287
That's a fact!

812
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:54,886
Even better.

813
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:59,652
So you're rich?
With a bank account, houses.

814
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:01,863
I own the house I live in. Okay?

815
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:04,622
And now I'll get going.

816
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:06,790
One moment.

817
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:09,467
Don't make me look foolish.

818
01:17:09,672 --> 01:17:13,301
At least let me introduce you
to the young man, Oscar.

819
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:15,770
Who the heck is Oscar?

820
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:23,485
Please step forward.

821
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:28,753
How elegant you look.

822
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:32,827
Come here. I'd like to introduce
you to the Signorina.

823
01:17:34,263 --> 01:17:36,561
She wanted to meet you too.

824
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:40,527
A pleasure.

825
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:43,261
The pleasure is all his,
believe me.

826
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:52,775
Now that you've met,
I'll leave you two alone.

827
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:58,117
This is a beautiful garden,
filled with flowers.

828
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:03,324
You can talk, confide in
each other. No one is listening.

829
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:06,888
Look, Signorina,
Oscar is offering his arm.

830
01:18:07,096 --> 01:18:11,430
Come, Signorina, take his arm.
There's no harm in that.

831
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:15,034
But we just met.

832
01:18:15,604 --> 01:18:18,505
You're strolling now.
The paths are full of flowers.

833
01:18:18,874 --> 01:18:22,901
The birds are chirping.
Oscar dares not speak.

834
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:25,580
He's shy... sensitive.

835
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:27,840
Now he says, "Signorina...

836
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:32,417
"I've been hoping to meet you
for such a long time.

837
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:34,756
"May I ask you a question?

838
01:18:36,392 --> 01:18:38,986
"You're not spoken for, are you?

839
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:42,829
"There was never
a man in your life?

840
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,731
"Ah, I thought so.

841
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:51,630
"I often see you standing by
your window, and at Sunday mass.

842
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:56,573
"Your eyes are always lowered.
You're always with your mother.

843
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:02,116
"That's good. Picking flowers
indicates a gentle soul.

844
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:06,778
"Signorina, may I hope
to see you again?

845
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:13,560
"Ah, thank you.
What did you say your name was?

846
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:20,165
"Thank you. I'll save this flower
like a precious object.

847
01:19:20,469 --> 01:19:21,993
"Would you dance with me?"

848
01:19:22,237 --> 01:19:25,604
Play, Maestro.
Oscar and Maria wish to dance.

849
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:29,838
The orchestra will play
a beautiful waltz.

850
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:38,679
"I'm wealthy, but I'm alone
and unhappy.

851
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:42,481
"What good are fancy cars,
long journeys and luxury hotels?

852
01:19:42,691 --> 01:19:44,522
"Smoke! Illusion!

853
01:19:44,793 --> 01:19:49,662
"What I really want is a home,
children, and a wife like you."

854
01:19:50,732 --> 01:19:54,828
When I was eighteen, that's when
you should have known me!

855
01:19:55,471 --> 01:19:57,803
I had long black hair.

856
01:19:57,873 --> 01:19:59,431
This long.

857
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:02,875
"For me, you'll always be eighteen."

858
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:06,408
Then it's true?

859
01:20:06,915 --> 01:20:08,212
You really love me?

860
01:20:09,384 --> 01:20:13,252
Is it really true?
You're not trying to fool me?

861
01:20:13,589 --> 01:20:15,784
Do you really love me?

862
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:30,765
There, there. It's all right.

863
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:46,783
What happened?

864
01:20:47,789 --> 01:20:49,654
What did you make me do?

865
01:21:00,602 --> 01:21:02,536
Still here?
I have to close up.

866
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:04,037
I'm going! I'm going!

867
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:09,071
Listen, are those creeps
still out there?

868
01:21:09,278 --> 01:21:11,576
Everybody's gone.
There's nobody left.

869
01:21:14,016 --> 01:21:16,143
Now get going.
I gotta close up.

870
01:21:16,485 --> 01:21:18,953
I'll show them a thing or two!

871
01:21:21,957 --> 01:21:23,288
Pardon me, Signorina.

872
01:21:24,326 --> 01:21:25,987
I'm Donofrio, accountant.

873
01:21:27,963 --> 01:21:29,453
Forgive my boldness.

874
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:34,131
I don't normally
stop young ladies in the street.

875
01:21:34,336 --> 01:21:36,201
I was inside
among the audience.

876
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:38,429
Oh! You were there, watching!

877
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,766
Great show!

878
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:41,331
I bet you like that stuff!

879
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:44,808
If I ever see that slimeball again--

880
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:48,711
Signorina!Please,
don't misunderstand me.

881
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:51,019
I agree with you!

882
01:21:51,653 --> 01:21:53,917
In fact, I sympathize with you.

883
01:21:54,356 --> 01:21:58,554
I came to tell you
how moved I was.

884
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:04,997
We can all pretend to be
cynical and scheming.

885
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:10,631
But when we're faced with
purity and innocence...

886
01:22:11,673 --> 01:22:14,005
the cynical mask
drops off...

887
01:22:15,043 --> 01:22:18,274
and all that is best in us
awakens.

888
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:24,885
I wanted to thank you.
You did me good.

889
01:22:28,023 --> 01:22:29,888
It's gotten chilly, hasn't it?

890
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:35,257
Excuse me.
It's the nighttime humidity.

891
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:39,594
May I buy you something?

892
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:42,669
I really don't know you.

893
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:50,235
Those damn creeps
are still there!

894
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:55,877
Excuse my persistence, but
these experiments with magnetism...

895
01:22:56,084 --> 01:22:57,676
are extremely dangerous.

896
01:22:57,919 --> 01:23:01,719
They can cause imbalances
and other disturbances.

897
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:06,191
That'swhy I felt so strange!

898
01:23:06,395 --> 01:23:09,831
Cold, hot, sweaty.
Like I had a fever.

899
01:23:10,932 --> 01:23:12,229
How about that!

900
01:23:12,434 --> 01:23:15,767
I would suggest a Fernet.
It'll do you good.

901
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:18,673
Come, we'll sit down.

902
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:20,664
Just a moment.

903
01:23:22,077 --> 01:23:23,567
Please sit down.

904
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:27,711
Two Fernet, please.

905
01:23:34,923 --> 01:23:37,892
I swear, I've rarely suffered
as I did tonight.

906
01:23:39,294 --> 01:23:44,129
When that charlatan spoke words
of love to you in Oscar's name...

907
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:49,461
and you answered with such
modesty and trepidation...

908
01:23:49,805 --> 01:23:51,329
it made me sick.

909
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:53,931
Something hurt me in here.

910
01:23:54,509 --> 01:23:57,000
I was ill. Really ill.

911
01:23:57,179 --> 01:23:58,976
Hurry up. I'm closing.

912
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,916
Don't be upset.

913
01:24:04,119 --> 01:24:08,556
Some things cannot be touched
by human vulgarity.

914
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:14,425
Even amidst a crowd
that laughs idiotically...

915
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:18,121
there's always someone
who understands, who knows.

916
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:20,091
Someone who appreciates.

917
01:24:28,009 --> 01:24:30,000
But what did I do?

918
01:24:31,146 --> 01:24:35,242
You acted out a very tender
and delicate love scene.

919
01:24:36,051 --> 01:24:38,144
I'm still deeply touched.

920
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:40,284
I can't even express it.

921
01:24:42,157 --> 01:24:45,888
Yes. What struck me most...

922
01:24:46,862 --> 01:24:51,026
is that deep inside,
you're as pure as you were at 1 8.

923
01:24:51,733 --> 01:24:54,497
When you went to Mass
with your mother...

924
01:24:55,003 --> 01:24:58,200
and had long black hair,
falling down to here.

925
01:25:00,075 --> 01:25:01,906
I really said that?

926
01:25:03,445 --> 01:25:04,935
Closing time.

927
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,569
How much?

928
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:07,941
1 50 lire.

929
01:25:11,787 --> 01:25:15,052
- Thank you.
- Hey, you, go sleep at home!

930
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:17,190
Listen, Signorina.

931
01:25:17,392 --> 01:25:20,828
What happened tonight is
extremely important to me.

932
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:23,020
Just imagine, if you will--

933
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:28,462
I'm not from around here.
I just came here by chance.

934
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:33,664
I enjoy strolling in the city
in sections that I don't know.

935
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:37,536
I went into that music hall
without knowing why.

936
01:25:37,746 --> 01:25:42,308
There's no explanation for what
happened. As if guided by fate.

937
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:44,451
Yes, that's the word: fate!

938
01:25:44,619 --> 01:25:45,916
But who are you?

939
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:48,552
You sound like you're from Parioli.

940
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:50,088
What do you mean?

941
01:25:50,292 --> 01:25:53,955
You talk like they do in Parioli.
A refined type.

942
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:58,895
I told you my name is Donofrio.
I'm a government employee.

943
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,829
What do you want from me?

944
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:07,238
You might understand me better
after I tell you my first name.

945
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:11,035
It's Oscar. My name is Oscar.

946
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:13,737
- Your name's Oscar?
- Yes.

947
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:18,349
So what? Your being Oscar
could be a coincidence, no?

948
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:24,248
Sure. But isn't it strange that
the hypnotist chose the name Oscar?

949
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:31,123
Signorina, I really must see you
again. You're waiting for the bus?

950
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:35,028
Yeah. I'm dead tired.
I gotta get to bed.

951
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:38,365
Do we say good-bye now,
never to meet again?

952
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:40,734
Impossible.
I've got to see you again!

953
01:26:41,977 --> 01:26:46,710
The city is vast and we still have
so much to say to each other.

954
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:49,945
When and where
can we meet again? Please!

955
01:26:50,785 --> 01:26:54,721
I don't know. I'm busy. I work.

956
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:58,522
I'm a salesgirl. Anyway,
what'll we say to each other?

957
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,421
- What?
- What would we say?

958
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:04,456
There's the bus. So long.
Arrivederci.

959
01:27:04,633 --> 01:27:07,295
Please, don't say no.
I work too.

960
01:27:07,536 --> 01:27:09,629
Maybe we can meet after work.

961
01:27:09,871 --> 01:27:13,432
Like tomorrow evening. Signorina,
wait, how about tomorrow evening?

962
01:27:13,808 --> 01:27:15,935
- In the evening I can't.
- Sunday afternoon, then?

963
01:27:16,144 --> 01:27:16,803
Sunday?

964
01:27:17,045 --> 01:27:18,979
Sunday, the Stazione Termini,
at 7:00.

965
01:27:19,247 --> 01:27:21,272
I don't know. I feel so strange.

966
01:27:25,186 --> 01:27:26,448
What're you doing?

967
01:27:26,755 --> 01:27:27,779
Hurry. Let's go!

968
01:28:16,271 --> 01:28:17,329
Here I am!

969
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:23,872
I was over there. Sorry I kept you
waiting. I was in the wrong spot.

970
01:28:24,112 --> 01:28:26,546
Thank you for coming here.

971
01:28:27,349 --> 01:28:30,978
You might have thought me
annoying, out of line.

972
01:28:31,219 --> 01:28:33,414
It was all so strange...

973
01:28:33,922 --> 01:28:35,583
as if I were dreaming.

974
01:28:36,992 --> 01:28:39,187
I took the liberty,
if you'll accept.

975
01:28:39,394 --> 01:28:42,659
Thanks. You didn't have to.

976
01:28:42,864 --> 01:28:46,391
My pleasure.
Let's go that way.

977
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:50,763
He says he likes to talk to me.
And he talks and talks.

978
01:28:50,839 --> 01:28:52,238
Boy, does he talk!

979
01:28:52,507 --> 01:28:55,772
The type who reads a lot.
Well educated.

980
01:28:56,011 --> 01:28:59,071
Last night we saw a first-run
movie at the Metropolitan.

981
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,145
- Hey! That's your third!
- They're so good!

982
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:02,611
I know they're good.

983
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:06,947
So we saw this first-run movie.
A costume picture.

984
01:29:07,188 --> 01:29:09,156
Gladiators, with Christian martyrs.

985
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:14,158
He explained to me that
it wasn't a true story.

986
01:29:14,362 --> 01:29:16,830
It's make-believe,
just for the movies, understand?

987
01:29:17,032 --> 01:29:19,227
And then, he told me that...

988
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:22,902
he gets a kick out of
talking to me because...

989
01:29:23,104 --> 01:29:24,901
because I understand him.

990
01:29:25,273 --> 01:29:27,104
He's even good-looking.

991
01:29:27,342 --> 01:29:30,869
Black eyes, brown skin.
A northern type.

992
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:33,309
Then we had pizza
at a trattoria.

993
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:34,541
He always pays.

994
01:29:34,983 --> 01:29:36,712
Even for the flowers.

995
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:39,545
- Nothing? He wants nothing?
- Of course not.

996
01:29:39,788 --> 01:29:41,779
Do me a favor, Cabi!

997
01:29:42,057 --> 01:29:44,617
I'll be meeting him again
tomorrow.

998
01:29:44,826 --> 01:29:46,088
What's he after?

999
01:29:47,929 --> 01:29:49,396
How do I know?

1000
01:29:49,597 --> 01:29:52,589
And who cares?
As long as he pays!

1001
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:53,790
Oh, sure!

1002
01:29:55,437 --> 01:29:58,065
The cops!
The cops!

1003
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:02,937
What you all need is jail!

1004
01:30:03,144 --> 01:30:04,736
Arrest them all!

1005
01:30:04,946 --> 01:30:08,177
I'm not running away.
If you want me, I'm here!

1006
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,116
How are you?
How elegant you look today!

1007
01:30:47,322 --> 01:30:48,687
How are you feeling?

1008
01:30:49,624 --> 01:30:53,082
- Fine, and you?
- Thank you. Here. For you.

1009
01:30:54,796 --> 01:30:57,264
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Don't mention it.

1010
01:30:57,465 --> 01:30:58,989
- It's too much.
- Take it.

1011
01:31:00,368 --> 01:31:01,892
Where shall we go?

1012
01:31:02,137 --> 01:31:04,037
Wherever you want.

1013
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:06,207
It's a sunny day.

1014
01:31:06,407 --> 01:31:08,136
Let's go to the Aventino.

1015
01:31:13,748 --> 01:31:16,444
Your family's not from Rome?

1016
01:31:16,651 --> 01:31:18,619
No. I have no family left.

1017
01:31:18,787 --> 01:31:21,756
My mother and father died
when I was a child.

1018
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:25,323
Loneliness is a heavy burden,
but I'd rather be alone...

1019
01:31:25,493 --> 01:31:26,653
than make compromises.

1020
01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:32,356
We lived in Puglia,
in a small village.

1021
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,592
The name is unimportant.
You wouldn't know it.

1022
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:39,806
I grew up in an old house.
I remember the oil lamps.

1023
01:31:40,175 --> 01:31:43,838
My father owned a small plot
of land. His name was Giovanni.

1024
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:48,010
My mother's name was Elsa,
the poor soul.

1025
01:31:48,249 --> 01:31:51,150
I like the name Elsa.
It's pretty.

1026
01:31:52,086 --> 01:31:55,522
I had no brothers or sisters.
When my father died...

1027
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:57,691
some ruthless relatives
robbed my mother...

1028
01:31:57,892 --> 01:32:00,986
of what little property
she had, leaving us very poor.

1029
01:32:01,196 --> 01:32:02,686
I went looking for work.

1030
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,046
What are you doing, my child?

1031
01:33:28,816 --> 01:33:29,874
Good day, Father.

1032
01:33:30,118 --> 01:33:31,949
Some alms for Sant'Antonio?

1033
01:33:32,153 --> 01:33:34,178
Sorry, I've no money on me.

1034
01:33:34,389 --> 01:33:36,084
Never mind. Some other time.

1035
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:38,987
What's important is
to always be in God's grace.

1036
01:33:39,227 --> 01:33:42,162
You arein God's grace,
aren't you, my child?

1037
01:33:43,798 --> 01:33:45,561
You're not in God's grace?

1038
01:33:49,504 --> 01:33:50,402
Why not?

1039
01:33:55,643 --> 01:33:57,508
Everyone should be
in God's grace.

1040
01:33:57,745 --> 01:34:00,737
Whoever lives in God's grace
is happy.

1041
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:04,577
I'm in God's grace
and I'm happy.

1042
01:34:05,486 --> 01:34:08,922
I even went to the Madonna
to ask for Her grace.

1043
01:34:09,157 --> 01:34:14,060
Maybe you didn't know how to
ask, or maybe you didn't need it.

1044
01:34:14,395 --> 01:34:15,828
Are you married?

1045
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:20,461
That's bad. Girls should get
married and make children.

1046
01:34:20,668 --> 01:34:23,102
Matrimony is a sacred thing.

1047
01:34:23,304 --> 01:34:27,104
In the grace of God, my child.
Ask Sant'Antonio for help.

1048
01:34:27,308 --> 01:34:30,971
If you need me,
I'm Brother Giovanni.

1049
01:34:32,814 --> 01:34:37,080
I'm at the San Francesco
Monastery, but I'm hard to find.

1050
01:34:37,986 --> 01:34:40,011
I'm always running around.

1051
01:35:00,441 --> 01:35:01,669
Hey, Blondie!

1052
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:10,283
So long!

1053
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,148
Tomorrow?

1054
01:35:14,355 --> 01:35:16,084
Tomorrow I'm busy.

1055
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:18,283
Then the day after tomorrow.
Same time.

1056
01:35:18,493 --> 01:35:20,120
I'm busy then too.

1057
01:35:20,895 --> 01:35:21,919
How come?

1058
01:35:23,398 --> 01:35:27,494
I was gonna tell you...

1059
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:29,669
I don't know if I'll keep seeing you.

1060
01:35:29,904 --> 01:35:30,996
But, why?

1061
01:35:35,276 --> 01:35:38,404
It's not that I'm uncomfortable
with you.

1062
01:35:40,848 --> 01:35:42,475
But what's the point?

1063
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:45,279
What am I doing with you?

1064
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,181
We're both wasting our time.

1065
01:35:48,122 --> 01:35:49,487
And doing what?

1066
01:35:50,324 --> 01:35:52,884
Anyway, what do you
want from me?

1067
01:35:54,128 --> 01:35:55,686
If you want...

1068
01:35:56,731 --> 01:35:58,062
I'll marry you.

1069
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:07,771
I wanted to ask you before.

1070
01:36:09,844 --> 01:36:12,938
But I didn't have the courage.
I've wanted to...

1071
01:36:14,515 --> 01:36:17,382
ask you since
the first time I saw you.

1072
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:20,777
What are you saying?

1073
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:23,347
Marry me?

1074
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:27,657
What are you saying?
Marry someone you've seen ten times?

1075
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:29,194
Someone you don't know?

1076
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:31,225
That's not how it's done!

1077
01:36:31,799 --> 01:36:35,394
Thank God I'm more honest
than some others.

1078
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:38,662
Excuse me,
but that's not how it's done!

1079
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,401
What do you know about me?

1080
01:36:41,709 --> 01:36:43,677
About who I am?

1081
01:36:45,313 --> 01:36:47,804
Is this how it's done?

1082
01:36:48,282 --> 01:36:50,682
You shouldn't fool somebody
this way!

1083
01:36:51,018 --> 01:36:53,350
Why pick on me
of all people!

1084
01:36:54,188 --> 01:36:55,450
Really!

1085
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:06,557
I've asked you no questions, and
I don't want to know anything.

1086
01:37:07,802 --> 01:37:09,133
Who cares?

1087
01:37:10,671 --> 01:37:12,832
Prejudices don't touch me.

1088
01:37:15,243 --> 01:37:18,474
Because what matters is...

1089
01:37:19,247 --> 01:37:21,545
is that I know your inner self.

1090
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:25,874
We are... we are
two lonely creatures.

1091
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:36,691
We have to stick together.
I need you.

1092
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,727
Don't tell me that.

1093
01:37:42,136 --> 01:37:43,933
Don't say that, if it isn't true.

1094
01:37:44,105 --> 01:37:44,901
But it is!

1095
01:37:59,687 --> 01:38:01,450
What did you do?

1096
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:03,621
What is it, you nut?

1097
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:05,625
I'm getting married,
that's what!

1098
01:38:06,093 --> 01:38:10,257
He asked me to marry him! We're
buying a store in Grotta Ferrata!

1099
01:38:10,464 --> 01:38:12,728
He's almost signed the contract.

1100
01:38:12,934 --> 01:38:16,893
Without me knowing, he arranged
it all: a store, a house!

1101
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:21,768
I'm selling everything!
I'll sell the house... the house--

1102
01:38:23,044 --> 01:38:25,205
We're getting married
in two weeks!

1103
01:38:26,047 --> 01:38:28,641
Wanda, I'm leaving!

1104
01:38:29,116 --> 01:38:30,743
Does he know that you--

1105
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:33,517
Of course he knows!
I told him everything.

1106
01:38:33,688 --> 01:38:35,781
I didn't hide anything
from him.

1107
01:38:36,023 --> 01:38:38,116
But he's a saint. An angel!

1108
01:38:38,326 --> 01:38:41,193
He didn't want to know
anything. He didn't care.

1109
01:38:41,462 --> 01:38:44,454
He loves me! He loves me!

1110
01:38:44,765 --> 01:38:46,596
Wanda! He loves me!

1111
01:39:03,584 --> 01:39:04,573
Who's there?

1112
01:39:10,157 --> 01:39:11,647
May I see Brother Giovanni?

1113
01:39:11,859 --> 01:39:14,692
He's not back yet.
Why do you want to see him?

1114
01:39:14,929 --> 01:39:18,194
- To confess to him.
- Go to church for confession.

1115
01:39:20,134 --> 01:39:22,796
I want Father Giovanni
to hear my confession.

1116
01:39:23,004 --> 01:39:26,940
He can't hear your confession.
He's not an ordained priest.

1117
01:39:27,275 --> 01:39:30,369
I know, but...
I'll wait for Father Giovanni.

1118
01:39:30,778 --> 01:39:32,678
Fine. Then wait.

1119
01:39:45,092 --> 01:39:48,550
Why'd you pack this?
I'm not taking that!

1120
01:39:49,096 --> 01:39:50,996
Should I take the owl?

1121
01:39:51,198 --> 01:39:54,429
Nah, it brings bad luck.
But I'll take the seashell.

1122
01:39:54,669 --> 01:39:57,832
See if it fits.
If it fits, I'll take it.

1123
01:39:58,039 --> 01:40:00,269
I sold that.
Put it over there.

1124
01:40:00,508 --> 01:40:04,911
What a waste!
Leaving all this good stuff.

1125
01:40:05,246 --> 01:40:08,238
- Here are the dishes.
- I sold them. Leave 'em!

1126
01:40:08,482 --> 01:40:09,414
Them too?

1127
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:12,051
Why not?
I got paid for them.

1128
01:40:12,253 --> 01:40:15,222
It would've cost more
to move everything.

1129
01:40:15,423 --> 01:40:18,415
He sold everything back home.
So I'm selling everything too.

1130
01:40:18,626 --> 01:40:20,491
We're starting over!
Everything new.

1131
01:40:20,728 --> 01:40:25,324
Me, I'd have taken all the stuff.
Are you forgetting anything?

1132
01:40:25,499 --> 01:40:26,830
What could I forget?

1133
01:40:27,068 --> 01:40:30,595
- Did you take the money?
- Of course! I'm no idiot!

1134
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:33,607
See? You forgot your fur.

1135
01:40:33,774 --> 01:40:35,002
Fur? What fur?

1136
01:40:35,676 --> 01:40:38,167
- No! I don't want that.
- How about giving it to my aunt?

1137
01:40:38,412 --> 01:40:41,108
Sure, but hurry!
They're waiting to move in!

1138
01:40:41,349 --> 01:40:43,647
Damn it! Those lowlifes.

1139
01:40:43,884 --> 01:40:46,011
Close the suitcase, will you?
Tight.

1140
01:40:48,789 --> 01:40:49,756
Oh, la mamma!

1141
01:40:55,963 --> 01:40:59,626
Take one more look,
and then I'm getting married.

1142
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,632
What?

1143
01:41:00,735 --> 01:41:02,532
I'm getting married too.

1144
01:41:02,737 --> 01:41:04,398
What did I say? Nothing.

1145
01:41:15,349 --> 01:41:17,408
How do I look?

1146
01:41:18,986 --> 01:41:20,715
Looks good on you.

1147
01:41:20,988 --> 01:41:22,615
It cost me 1 ,200 lire.

1148
01:41:22,823 --> 01:41:24,484
You got robbed.

1149
01:41:24,992 --> 01:41:26,789
You paid too much.

1150
01:41:29,063 --> 01:41:30,496
Ah, my pocketbook.

1151
01:41:31,132 --> 01:41:33,692
Good-bye, D'Artagnan.
Let's get going.

1152
01:41:34,635 --> 01:41:36,830
Time to leave.
Let's get going.

1153
01:41:51,085 --> 01:41:54,179
See them? I can't stand
those starving bastards.

1154
01:41:57,792 --> 01:41:59,225
Let's go.

1155
01:42:05,566 --> 01:42:09,297
Here are the house keys.
I'm leaving. Arrivederci.

1156
01:42:11,205 --> 01:42:15,039
If you need anything, just tell
my friend, Signorina Wanda.

1157
01:42:15,209 --> 01:42:17,575
She'll write to me.
Arrivederci.

1158
01:42:18,312 --> 01:42:20,177
Have a good trip. Good luck!

1159
01:42:20,414 --> 01:42:22,075
Thank you. Likewise.

1160
01:42:38,132 --> 01:42:41,067
Never mind. I don't wanna
say good-bye to anybody.

1161
01:42:41,469 --> 01:42:43,300
It's better that way.

1162
01:42:43,537 --> 01:42:46,097
I'm so happy now,
and then all these people...

1163
01:42:46,307 --> 01:42:47,899
they'll ask questions.

1164
01:42:47,975 --> 01:42:49,135
Ah! Luciana!

1165
01:42:49,343 --> 01:42:50,970
I'm leaving.
I'm getting married!

1166
01:42:51,212 --> 01:42:54,943
- Send us some wedding candy!
- I will!

1167
01:42:57,451 --> 01:43:00,113
Say good-bye to Nando and
his uncle, and to everyone.

1168
01:43:10,297 --> 01:43:11,559
Nice, eh?

1169
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:13,692
They're pretty.

1170
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:20,800
You're getting married...

1171
01:43:21,475 --> 01:43:24,239
and I never met
this fianc of yours.

1172
01:43:24,478 --> 01:43:27,038
I couldn't bring him
where everybody knows me.

1173
01:43:28,516 --> 01:43:29,949
Here's the bus.

1174
01:43:32,786 --> 01:43:33,810
It's here.

1175
01:43:42,029 --> 01:43:43,360
Ciao, Wa'.

1176
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:44,988
Why are you crying?

1177
01:43:46,534 --> 01:43:47,865
Who's crying?

1178
01:43:48,102 --> 01:43:49,967
Aren't you crying?

1179
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:56,200
I'll write the minute I get there
with my address.

1180
01:43:57,344 --> 01:43:59,312
And you'll get married too.

1181
01:43:59,713 --> 01:44:00,645
Let's go.

1182
01:44:02,149 --> 01:44:06,483
Hurry, the suitcase.
I'll send my address right away.

1183
01:44:17,932 --> 01:44:21,333
Stay out of trouble. You'll...

1184
01:44:21,402 --> 01:44:23,529
You'll get a miracle, like me.

1185
01:44:23,771 --> 01:44:26,831
- Yeah, sure.
- It'll happen.

1186
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:10,983
- What are you doing?
- I want to pay.

1187
01:45:11,185 --> 01:45:14,518
- But there's no reason.
- Please! You've always paid.

1188
01:45:15,055 --> 01:45:17,387
Anyway, what's mine is yours now.

1189
01:45:17,591 --> 01:45:19,991
It's all the same, isn't it?

1190
01:45:23,497 --> 01:45:24,521
Waiter!

1191
01:45:31,171 --> 01:45:32,832
It's getting late.

1192
01:45:36,076 --> 01:45:38,840
You'll see how beautiful
the sunsets are up here.

1193
01:45:46,086 --> 01:45:48,213
You want to get me drunk?

1194
01:45:48,922 --> 01:45:50,651
It's such a light wine.

1195
01:45:59,967 --> 01:46:01,264
The money.

1196
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:04,901
Put it away.

1197
01:46:07,107 --> 01:46:08,438
It's my dowry.

1198
01:46:11,745 --> 01:46:15,078
350,000 for the house.
That's all those crooks would pay.

1199
01:46:15,315 --> 01:46:18,443
They knew I was in a hurry,
so they took advantage.

1200
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,745
Then I got all my money
from the bank.

1201
01:46:21,989 --> 01:46:23,422
400,000.

1202
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:26,786
See? I made them give me
all new bills.

1203
01:46:47,881 --> 01:46:50,315
Because you never asked
if I had money.

1204
01:46:50,784 --> 01:46:54,311
You, you're an angel,
a saint!

1205
01:46:54,722 --> 01:46:58,886
If you knew what I went through
to end up with this money.

1206
01:46:59,893 --> 01:47:02,987
I told you, I don't want to know.
Please!

1207
01:47:03,497 --> 01:47:05,328
Let's get away from here.

1208
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,230
The beatings I took.

1209
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:13,231
You see, some guys are
just after a girl's money.

1210
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,067
You wouldn't believe it.

1211
01:47:15,809 --> 01:47:19,074
Everything for love.
But not that way.

1212
01:47:19,513 --> 01:47:22,277
But what about my old age?

1213
01:47:22,916 --> 01:47:24,281
Who worries about my old age?

1214
01:47:25,219 --> 01:47:27,050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1215
01:47:29,223 --> 01:47:30,690
Waiter, keep the change.

1216
01:47:31,558 --> 01:47:32,490
Let's go.

1217
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:37,121
I didn't want to go on
like that forever.

1218
01:47:37,331 --> 01:47:40,198
I'd have quit if I could,
even tomorrow.

1219
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,334
I'd have gone away.

1220
01:47:42,536 --> 01:47:46,302
To live that way forever?
I already owned the house.

1221
01:47:46,507 --> 01:47:48,236
Know what me
and Wanda planned?

1222
01:47:48,475 --> 01:47:52,002
We were gonna rent a newsstand.

1223
01:47:52,246 --> 01:47:55,511
Understand?
Where are we going?

1224
01:47:55,849 --> 01:47:57,316
It's so nice here.

1225
01:47:57,551 --> 01:47:59,951
Let's take a little walk. Okay?

1226
01:48:00,954 --> 01:48:03,184
I don't even remember
how I started.

1227
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:07,019
I was a child,
that's all I remember.

1228
01:48:07,294 --> 01:48:08,818
And the suitcases?

1229
01:48:08,896 --> 01:48:10,363
We'll take them later.

1230
01:48:11,965 --> 01:48:14,627
You shoulda seen me at 1 5...

1231
01:48:14,868 --> 01:48:17,098
with my long black hair...

1232
01:48:17,171 --> 01:48:18,229
down to here.

1233
01:48:18,438 --> 01:48:21,532
Who understood anything?
My mother just wanted the money.

1234
01:48:21,742 --> 01:48:23,232
Where are we going?

1235
01:48:23,443 --> 01:48:25,741
I don't know.
We're just strolling.

1236
01:48:26,647 --> 01:48:28,638
What's the name of that song?

1237
01:48:42,596 --> 01:48:43,756
Won't you kiss me?

1238
01:49:08,155 --> 01:49:09,122
Come.

1239
01:49:10,591 --> 01:49:12,491
I know a shortcut.

1240
01:49:41,555 --> 01:49:43,250
Oscar! Where are you?

1241
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:47,319
What a bad boy you are!

1242
01:49:50,063 --> 01:49:52,361
Look at these flowers.
Like 'em?

1243
01:49:52,699 --> 01:49:54,724
They stink, but still.

1244
01:49:55,402 --> 01:49:57,597
I never saw flowers
like these before.

1245
01:49:57,905 --> 01:49:59,099
Let's go.

1246
01:49:59,339 --> 01:50:00,670
I'm coming.

1247
01:50:03,944 --> 01:50:06,742
Smell them.
What kind of flowers are they?

1248
01:50:07,447 --> 01:50:09,677
What's wrong? Are you sad?

1249
01:50:09,983 --> 01:50:11,416
Me? No. Why?

1250
01:50:11,618 --> 01:50:13,984
You stopped singing.
Wait a minute.

1251
01:50:18,558 --> 01:50:21,493
Why don't we carve
our initials on the trees?

1252
01:50:23,063 --> 01:50:25,156
Let's go. The sunset
is beautiful in the woods.

1253
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:29,301
The sunset, eh?
Where do you wanna go?

1254
01:50:45,118 --> 01:50:47,052
What a strange light.

1255
01:51:02,436 --> 01:51:03,460
Beautiful, isn't it?

1256
01:51:07,174 --> 01:51:10,337
I guess there is some justice
in the world.

1257
01:51:11,979 --> 01:51:15,676
You suffer,
you go through hell...

1258
01:51:17,217 --> 01:51:21,119
but then happiness
comes along for everyone.

1259
01:51:23,657 --> 01:51:25,716
You've been my angel.

1260
01:51:26,193 --> 01:51:29,060
Your hand is freezing.
Are you cold?

1261
01:51:32,232 --> 01:51:33,859
Having regrets?

1262
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:38,296
Beautiful, eh?

1263
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:41,731
Look how deep it is!

1264
01:51:42,009 --> 01:51:45,001
I'd love a boat ride
right now.

1265
01:51:45,712 --> 01:51:48,237
Are there any boats
down there now?

1266
01:51:48,515 --> 01:51:50,813
- Can you swim?
- Not me!

1267
01:51:51,351 --> 01:51:54,218
I almost drowned once.
But they saved me.

1268
01:51:54,421 --> 01:51:56,616
Just imagine!
I was pushed in!

1269
01:52:00,327 --> 01:52:01,316
What's wrong?

1270
01:52:16,676 --> 01:52:18,007
What's the matter?

1271
01:52:21,214 --> 01:52:23,876
You don't want to kill me,
do you?

1272
01:52:25,986 --> 01:52:27,214
Answer me!

1273
01:52:28,455 --> 01:52:30,423
You want to kill me?

1274
01:52:32,225 --> 01:52:33,954
You want to kill me!

1275
01:52:35,028 --> 01:52:38,191
Don't just stand there.
Say something!

1276
01:52:39,132 --> 01:52:43,626
Speak! Don't be like that!
Speak!

1277
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:46,428
Tell me.

1278
01:52:51,645 --> 01:52:53,442
For... the money?

1279
01:52:57,317 --> 01:52:58,682
For the money.

1280
01:53:25,545 --> 01:53:29,572
Kill me! Kill me!
Throw me off the cliff!

1281
01:53:29,816 --> 01:53:32,148
I don't wanna live anymore!

1282
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:39,915
I don't wanna live anymore!

1283
01:53:40,093 --> 01:53:43,824
Kill me! Throw me off the cliff!

1284
01:53:44,431 --> 01:53:48,094
I don't wanna live anymore!

1285
01:53:49,436 --> 01:53:50,994
Go ahead!

1286
01:53:51,204 --> 01:53:53,604
Shut up, stupid!

1287
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:58,436
I don't want to hurt you.
Can't you see that?

1288
01:53:59,112 --> 01:54:01,546
I don't wanna live anymore!

1289
01:54:05,085 --> 01:54:08,612
Kill me! Kill me!

1290
01:55:31,838 --> 01:55:35,535
Maurizio, hurry up!
We're leaving!

1291
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:49,912
We're gonna lose our way
going home!

1292
01:58:01,242 --> 01:58:05,542
Nights of Cabiria,
188A, take four.

1293
01:58:06,347 --> 01:58:08,144
Silence!

1294
01:58:08,315 --> 01:58:09,509
Roll!

1295
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:11,710
Mind you, I have my own house...

1296
01:58:11,785 --> 01:58:15,186
with water, electricity, bottled gas,
every convenience. I got everything.

1297
01:58:15,256 --> 01:58:16,780
Even a thermometer.

1298
01:58:16,857 --> 01:58:20,759
See this one here?
She never, ever slept under an arch.

1299
01:58:20,995 --> 01:58:23,429
Well, maybe once... or twice.

1300
01:58:24,365 --> 01:58:28,028
Of course, my house is
nothing like this.

1301
01:58:28,536 --> 01:58:30,936
But it's enough for me.
I like it.

1302
01:58:31,305 --> 01:58:33,330
This is Cabiria...

1303
01:58:33,908 --> 01:58:36,035
a poor, helpless little woman...

1304
01:58:36,143 --> 01:58:39,135
who lives amid evil
without losing hope in good.

1305
01:58:39,947 --> 01:58:42,279
An angel with her wings
in the mud...

1306
01:58:42,349 --> 01:58:46,410
untiring in her fight
to keep alive her faith in men.

1307
01:58:47,354 --> 01:58:50,915
Cabiria's story is made up of
comical and dramatic adventures...

1308
01:58:51,258 --> 01:58:56,059
which she lives simply,
her faith in love unwavering.

1309
01:58:56,564 --> 01:58:58,532
Go inside!

1310
01:58:58,699 --> 01:59:00,394
I don't have the keys.

1311
01:59:01,202 --> 01:59:03,796
- Where'd you put them?
- In my purse.

1312
01:59:03,871 --> 01:59:05,133
Where's your purse?

1313
01:59:05,272 --> 01:59:10,733
Giulietta Masina, dubbed by
worldwide press "a female Chaplin"...

1314
01:59:10,811 --> 01:59:15,510
brings to Cabiria all her strength
of expression and compassion.

1315
01:59:16,183 --> 01:59:19,744
For the portrayal
of this deeply endearing character...

1316
01:59:20,221 --> 01:59:24,089
Giulietta Masina received
the award for Best Actress...

1317
01:59:24,158 --> 01:59:26,285
at the Cannes Film Festival.

1318
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:50,412
Dino De Laurentiis, the brave
creator of War and Peace...

1319
01:59:50,818 --> 01:59:54,652
brings you this film,
the fullest expression...

1320
01:59:54,888 --> 01:59:58,221
of Federico Fellini's
unique poetic vision.

1321
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:02,253
Nights of Cabiria
is a fascinating tale...

1322
02:00:02,329 --> 02:00:04,820
where fantasy and reality blend...

1323
02:00:04,898 --> 02:00:08,857
in a world alive with compassion.

1324
02:00:08,936 --> 02:00:11,268
This is Federico Fellini's
masterpiece.

1325
02:00:12,139 --> 02:00:13,606
If you want...

1326
02:00:14,708 --> 02:00:16,198
I'll marry you.

1327
02:00:17,444 --> 02:00:18,433
What are you saying?

1328
02:00:20,014 --> 02:00:21,538
Marry me?

1329
02:00:22,583 --> 02:00:25,848
What are you saying?
Marry someone you've seen ten times?

1330
02:00:25,919 --> 02:00:27,784
Someone you don't know?

1331
02:00:27,855 --> 02:00:30,153
That's not how it's done!

1332
02:00:32,092 --> 02:00:35,528
The strangest adventures,
the wildest encounters...

1333
02:00:35,863 --> 02:00:39,526
the most unusual characters
appear in Nights of Cabiria.

1334
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:43,258
Characters portrayed by
the most famous and beloved actors...

1335
02:00:54,315 --> 02:00:56,840
Madonna, help me
to change my life.

1336
02:00:57,618 --> 02:01:00,485
A marvelous performance
by Giulietta Masina...

1337
02:01:00,554 --> 02:01:03,421
the unforgettable Gelsomina
of La Strada...

1338
02:01:03,624 --> 02:01:06,616
the first Italian film
to ever receive...

1339
02:01:06,694 --> 02:01:12,155
the highest award in film:
the Oscar, 1957.

1340
02:01:12,299 --> 02:01:15,029
I guess there is some justice
in the world.

1341
02:01:16,003 --> 02:01:19,461
You suffer,
you go through hell...

1342
02:01:20,207 --> 02:01:24,007
but then happiness
comes along for everyone.

1343
02:01:24,178 --> 02:01:26,078
I'm getting married,
that's what!

1344
02:01:26,146 --> 02:01:30,242
He asked me to marry him. We're
buying a store in Grotta Ferrata.

1345
02:01:30,317 --> 02:01:34,014
He loves me. He loves me!

1346
02:05:42,918 --> 02:05:46,684
Dino De Laurentiis took Fellini on...

1347
02:05:46,756 --> 02:05:50,556
and it was a good move
that he can be very proud of.

1348
02:05:50,626 --> 02:05:53,618
After the problems Fellini had...

1349
02:05:53,696 --> 02:05:57,132
every time he looked for a producer...

1350
02:05:57,199 --> 02:06:00,862
and that continued on
long after I left Fellini's crew--

1351
02:06:00,936 --> 02:06:03,928
Fellini had terrible problems
finding a producer.

1352
02:06:04,006 --> 02:06:07,840
You perhaps wouldn't think so,
but I saw it...

1353
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:10,174
on the three films
on which I worked as assistant.

1354
02:06:10,246 --> 02:06:13,545
We were waiting
in the production office...

1355
02:06:13,649 --> 02:06:16,117
to change producers,
and it was not working.

1356
02:06:16,185 --> 02:06:19,985
We didn't have a producer. We tried out
another one, but that didn't work.

1357
02:06:20,055 --> 02:06:24,492
It was amazingly difficult.

1358
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:27,552
In fact, Visconti had the same problems.

1359
02:06:27,630 --> 02:06:29,928
It seems to go hand in hand
with Italian cinema...

1360
02:06:29,999 --> 02:06:32,729
or maybe with the cost
of these movies...

1361
02:06:32,802 --> 02:06:34,463
because those were
very expensive movies...

1362
02:06:34,537 --> 02:06:38,132
much more expensive...

1363
02:06:38,207 --> 02:06:41,665
than the average ambitious film.

1364
02:06:41,744 --> 02:06:47,444
The producer of his previous film,
II Bidone...

1365
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:52,510
didn't want to do the film.

1366
02:06:52,621 --> 02:06:55,988
I think it was because he didn't believe
Giulietta Masina was...

1367
02:06:56,058 --> 02:07:01,189
a first-rate actress...
which she really wasn't.

1368
02:07:01,263 --> 02:07:04,460
She had had a career earlier,
she had made films with Rossellini...

1369
02:07:04,533 --> 02:07:10,233
small films, small roles with Fellini,
but she had never--

1370
02:07:10,306 --> 02:07:13,241
She had made La Strada,
of course.

1371
02:07:13,309 --> 02:07:17,245
La Strada was also Dino De Laurentiis
and Ponti, right?

1372
02:07:17,313 --> 02:07:23,309
Then there was Lombardo, and then
De Laurentiis took him on...

1373
02:07:23,452 --> 02:07:24,441
which he felt very good about.

1374
02:07:24,553 --> 02:07:26,646
Everything went very well.
He would come to the set.

1375
02:07:26,755 --> 02:07:29,553
He wasn't at all difficult.
He trusted Fellini.

1376
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:34,991
After that, I don't know
if they made films together.

1377
02:07:36,932 --> 02:07:40,595
De Laurentiis was
a sort of false despot.

1378
02:07:40,669 --> 02:07:46,039
There was a part of him that resembled
Bonaparte or Mussolini.

1379
02:07:46,108 --> 02:07:51,171
He had a harsh, anxious
expression.

1380
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:54,546
You could almost imagine him
putting his hand in his shirt.

1381
02:07:56,418 --> 02:08:00,115
It was an image.
He was from Naples.

1382
02:08:00,189 --> 02:08:02,157
And then there was the whole gang:

1383
02:08:02,258 --> 02:08:06,126
his brother, who was
much more reserved...

1384
02:08:06,195 --> 02:08:08,493
and whom he cast
as production manager.

1385
02:08:08,564 --> 02:08:13,160
That's the Mediterranean custom.
The family had to be there.

1386
02:08:13,235 --> 02:08:17,194
He had Silvana Mangano work a lot
on his films.

1387
02:08:17,273 --> 02:08:20,674
Kind of a family business.

1388
02:08:20,743 --> 02:08:23,405
I'm very proud to have made
those films.

1389
02:08:23,479 --> 02:08:28,075
Silvana Mangano did not make a career
out of being a producer's wife.

1390
02:08:28,183 --> 02:08:32,916
She made a career out of being
a wonderful, marvelous actress.

1391
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:36,656
He had a good instinct
in marrying Silvana...

1392
02:08:36,725 --> 02:08:40,684
and he had a good instinct
in trusting Federico.

1393
02:08:40,763 --> 02:08:42,754
He's a great producer
and a great man.

1394
02:08:49,093 --> 02:08:51,061
Franois Prier didn't know him.

1395
02:08:51,161 --> 02:08:53,823
In Italy at that time
there were very few movies...

1396
02:08:53,897 --> 02:08:57,765
except for American and Italian films.

1397
02:08:57,835 --> 02:09:02,135
There were very few subtitled movies.

1398
02:09:02,206 --> 02:09:05,937
The Italians were not yet the great
film lovers that we already were.

1399
02:09:07,444 --> 02:09:10,971
Fellini was looking for an actor
for a coproduction...

1400
02:09:11,048 --> 02:09:13,881
with Films Marceau.

1401
02:09:13,951 --> 02:09:16,852
They had to have someone
from the French cinema involved...

1402
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:20,412
in order for it to qualify
as a coproduction.

1403
02:09:20,524 --> 02:09:23,652
He asked me,
"Which actor should we get?"

1404
02:09:23,761 --> 02:09:26,787
I couldn't describe
all French actors...

1405
02:09:26,897 --> 02:09:31,493
so I went to Unifrance Films
in Rome.

1406
02:09:31,568 --> 02:09:34,264
I told them, "Mr. Fellini is looking
for a French actor.

1407
02:09:34,338 --> 02:09:40,277
"Lend me the directory
of French actors."

1408
02:09:40,344 --> 02:09:45,714
You know, the big directory
with pictures of a lot of actors.

1409
02:09:45,783 --> 02:09:47,774
Unfortunately, not all the actors
are in the directory.

1410
02:09:47,851 --> 02:09:52,185
Unifrance told me
it was their only copy...

1411
02:09:52,523 --> 02:09:54,081
and that I had to return it.

1412
02:09:54,191 --> 02:09:56,159
I had to insist in order to get them
to lend it to me.

1413
02:09:56,260 --> 02:09:59,787
So I brought him the book, and Fellini
started to tear out pages...

1414
02:09:59,897 --> 02:10:04,766
a dozen pictures of people
he didn't know.

1415
02:10:04,835 --> 02:10:10,102
There was Pierre Dux,
there was Raymond Bussieres...

1416
02:10:10,174 --> 02:10:11,903
and there was Franois Prier.

1417
02:10:11,975 --> 02:10:14,637
He hung them up behind his desk.

1418
02:10:14,712 --> 02:10:19,081
There was a collage
of all the people...

1419
02:10:19,149 --> 02:10:21,140
who had sent their pictures...

1420
02:10:21,218 --> 02:10:23,914
people from Rome, strangers,
women who wanted to be in the movies.

1421
02:10:23,987 --> 02:10:27,753
Every time he found a face he liked,
he would hang it up.

1422
02:10:27,858 --> 02:10:31,055
That didn't mean that person
would be in the film...

1423
02:10:31,128 --> 02:10:34,586
but when he entered the office
it would inspire him.

1424
02:10:34,698 --> 02:10:39,795
It created an imaginary landscape,
a kind of film before the real film.

1425
02:10:40,471 --> 02:10:45,568
He had hung up the picture
of Franois Prier in his gallery.

1426
02:10:45,642 --> 02:10:49,169
Then he took a pencil
and drew a little moustache on him.

1427
02:10:49,246 --> 02:10:54,183
After a few days he asked me,
"Who is this Franois Prier?"

1428
02:10:54,251 --> 02:10:56,344
I said, "He's a great actor,"
and he said, "Really? Very good."

1429
02:10:56,420 --> 02:11:01,016
So we hired Franois Prier
just like that, without any problem.

1430
02:11:01,125 --> 02:11:04,390
The French coproducers were
very happy to cast a star...

1431
02:11:04,461 --> 02:11:06,656
and everything went very well
with Franois Prier.

1432
02:11:07,131 --> 02:11:09,599
Prier was a leading man
who was now getting older...

1433
02:11:09,666 --> 02:11:13,796
the nice guy, the average Parisian,
but likeable nonetheless...

1434
02:11:13,871 --> 02:11:17,602
someone everybody liked,
and that was exactly the point.

1435
02:11:17,674 --> 02:11:22,270
Prier didn't know he was all
those things, but that was the point.

1436
02:11:22,346 --> 02:11:24,906
You would see Franois Prier
and you'd trust him...

1437
02:11:24,982 --> 02:11:26,882
because you'd think,
"Oh, it's Franois Prier."

1438
02:11:26,950 --> 02:11:31,683
Much later in the movie you learn that,
on the contrary, he's a total bastard.

1439
02:11:31,822 --> 02:11:36,555
It was a great idea,
one of Fellini's intuitive visions...

1440
02:11:36,627 --> 02:11:40,620
to take somebody who inspired
confidence and use him...

1441
02:11:40,731 --> 02:11:45,361
to keep up this deception...

1442
02:11:45,436 --> 02:11:48,496
with the character, with Cabiria
and with the audience.

1443
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:54,635
And it's precisely in that scene
in the restaurant--

1444
02:11:54,711 --> 02:11:59,341
Franois Prier was very worried.
"I'm still playing a good guy!"

1445
02:11:59,416 --> 02:12:01,976
And it kept on like this,
and he kept saying:

1446
02:12:02,052 --> 02:12:05,351
"When will I get to play the character
I'm waiting to play-- the bastard?

1447
02:12:05,456 --> 02:12:06,684
"That's what interests me."

1448
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:12,160
So in the restaurant scene there's this
close-up, which Fellini never does...

1449
02:12:12,229 --> 02:12:16,290
this huge close-up from his forehead
to his nose...

1450
02:12:16,366 --> 02:12:19,529
in response to Cabiria's
questioning look that's saying:

1451
02:12:19,603 --> 02:12:24,063
"Are you happy? Is everything all right?
We've found happiness, haven't we?"

1452
02:12:24,141 --> 02:12:27,975
So there's this close-up
of him looking at the bag.

1453
02:12:28,045 --> 02:12:30,377
Of course, in this close-up
you can see there's something else.

1454
02:12:30,447 --> 02:12:32,506
This is writing with the camera.

1455
02:12:32,583 --> 02:12:37,714
By giving that importance to a look,
you show something else is going on.

1456
02:12:37,788 --> 02:12:41,224
Prier was reassured and said,
"From this point on, the audience...

1457
02:12:41,291 --> 02:12:43,259
"will realize that there is
something more to my character...

1458
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:48,263
"that I'm more than this boring suitor
who falls in love...

1459
02:12:48,332 --> 02:12:50,425
"with this prostitute
and wants to save her."

1460
02:12:56,031 --> 02:12:59,762
Being Fellini's friend, I immediately
became Giulietta Masina's friend also.

1461
02:12:59,835 --> 02:13:03,794
She had total confidence in me.

1462
02:13:03,873 --> 02:13:07,809
Though the other assistants never
showed it, perhaps they were jealous...

1463
02:13:07,877 --> 02:13:13,474
of this intruder, this little prince,
this newcomer.

1464
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:17,212
I was made to feel very welcome.

1465
02:13:17,286 --> 02:13:20,084
I don't know if it was just
innate kindness...

1466
02:13:20,156 --> 02:13:22,590
or if they wanted to be
on good terms with me...

1467
02:13:22,658 --> 02:13:25,491
because I had a certain influence.

1468
02:13:25,561 --> 02:13:28,086
I was a kind of minence grise.

1469
02:13:28,230 --> 02:13:31,996
But I was accepted
in a wonderful way.

1470
02:13:32,067 --> 02:13:34,433
Giulietta Masina was a real friend.

1471
02:13:34,503 --> 02:13:39,304
Giulietta was perhaps
the only person...

1472
02:13:39,375 --> 02:13:44,779
with whom Fellini the director
would be tough.

1473
02:13:45,714 --> 02:13:47,978
Maybe because she was his wife...

1474
02:13:48,050 --> 02:13:50,985
he wanted to avoid giving her
any special treatment.

1475
02:13:51,787 --> 02:13:54,654
I remember two very difficult scenes.

1476
02:13:55,624 --> 02:13:58,616
One took place at the villa
of the actor Amedeo Nazzari.

1477
02:14:00,396 --> 02:14:03,957
Wanting to show off in front
of Giulietta...

1478
02:14:04,066 --> 02:14:07,502
and seeing she was a simple woman
who didn't know much of the world...

1479
02:14:07,703 --> 02:14:12,731
he put on a record
of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

1480
02:14:12,808 --> 02:14:17,268
The poor little thing was sitting there
on a stool...

1481
02:14:17,346 --> 02:14:21,942
having been kidnapped, and uncertain
of what was going to happen.

1482
02:14:22,751 --> 02:14:26,380
So he puts on the record and says...

1483
02:14:26,455 --> 02:14:29,390
"La Quinta," meaning "the Fifth."

1484
02:14:29,458 --> 02:14:31,153
That means nothing to her.

1485
02:14:31,427 --> 02:14:35,090
Then he says, "Do you like it?"

1486
02:14:35,197 --> 02:14:37,859
And Giulietta says...

1487
02:14:37,967 --> 02:14:42,904
"Well, that's... something."

1488
02:14:43,639 --> 02:14:47,735
Fellini made her repeat this line...

1489
02:14:47,810 --> 02:14:51,337
1 2 or 1 5 times in a close-up.

1490
02:14:52,648 --> 02:14:56,982
This had the effect of making her
more upset with each take.

1491
02:14:57,052 --> 02:15:01,113
It wasn't that he's like Bresson.
That wasn't Fellini's usual manner.

1492
02:15:01,190 --> 02:15:05,251
He just thought, "I'll use her
to show that I'm very demanding."

1493
02:15:05,361 --> 02:15:11,061
I didn't see any difference between
the first take and the fifteenth take.

1494
02:15:11,267 --> 02:15:14,259
By the end, she began to cry
because she couldn't go on.

1495
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:19,103
She said, "I'm just a little actress.
I can't do any better."

1496
02:15:19,174 --> 02:15:23,440
So on the sixteenth take,
Fellini said, "Okay, that will do."

1497
02:15:23,512 --> 02:15:26,538
It happened another time
with Franois Prier...

1498
02:15:26,615 --> 02:15:32,053
in the scene where they are...

1499
02:15:32,121 --> 02:15:34,055
in a restaurant on a lake...

1500
02:15:34,123 --> 02:15:38,287
where he made her repeat a line--
I don't remember which line.

1501
02:15:38,394 --> 02:15:40,362
It was very embarrassing,
and Franois didn't know how...

1502
02:15:40,462 --> 02:15:42,623
to make it go more smoothly.

1503
02:15:42,731 --> 02:15:45,791
This time also...

1504
02:15:45,901 --> 02:15:49,530
she just couldn't repeat the same line
1 5 or 20 times...

1505
02:15:49,605 --> 02:15:51,971
without him telling her
why it wasn't working.

1506
02:15:52,107 --> 02:15:54,098
But other than that...

1507
02:15:54,176 --> 02:15:58,010
actors always said
that to make a film with Fellini...

1508
02:15:58,080 --> 02:16:00,071
was a marvelous experience.

1509
02:16:00,149 --> 02:16:02,379
We didn't feel
like we were working.

1510
02:16:02,451 --> 02:16:06,683
We felt like the guests
of this great man...

1511
02:16:06,755 --> 02:16:09,883
who was inviting us
to share a feast.

1512
02:16:09,959 --> 02:16:11,893
We didn't know when
we were filming and when we weren't.

1513
02:16:11,994 --> 02:16:14,963
Such was his skill at putting people
at ease. It was wonderful.

1514
02:16:15,030 --> 02:16:20,161
Anouk Aime was so pleased that,
after making two films with him...

1515
02:16:20,235 --> 02:16:22,760
she refused all other films, saying:

1516
02:16:22,838 --> 02:16:27,434
"No, I can't. What if Fellini
should call and offer me a small role?

1517
02:16:27,509 --> 02:16:29,704
"I would be devastated
if I had to turn him down."

1518
02:16:29,778 --> 02:16:31,712
He was the ultimate in charm.

1519
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:37,514
He had a nickname, II Faro,
which means "the lighthouse."

1520
02:16:37,586 --> 02:16:42,785
There was also an atmosphere
as if in a royal court.

1521
02:16:42,858 --> 02:16:45,884
Everything revolved around him,
and he was the choreographer...

1522
02:16:45,995 --> 02:16:49,692
of this ballet of courtesans.

1523
02:16:49,798 --> 02:16:53,529
But all of this took place
without any kind of pettiness...

1524
02:16:53,602 --> 02:16:55,968
but with the charm
of a royal ballet.

1525
02:16:56,038 --> 02:17:01,999
He knew everyone's name,
right down to the last extra.

1526
02:17:02,077 --> 02:17:07,071
It was incredibly warm and human.
Everybody said so.

1527
02:17:13,167 --> 02:17:18,605
The great scene that was
very important in the film...

1528
02:17:18,672 --> 02:17:21,300
was the pilgrimage
to the Divino Amore...

1529
02:17:21,375 --> 02:17:26,210
that the prostitutes make
in order to ask...

1530
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:28,680
that their crippled uncle be cured.

1531
02:17:28,849 --> 02:17:34,845
So you have this mixture
of prostitutes, of outcasts...

1532
02:17:35,022 --> 02:17:39,254
with the faithful,
who were very Catholic...

1533
02:17:39,326 --> 02:17:41,556
very Italian, and very Roman.

1534
02:17:43,931 --> 02:17:49,369
It was a very Felliniesque situation.

1535
02:17:51,305 --> 02:17:57,073
So it's in a very sincere way
that this mixture of prostitutes...

1536
02:17:57,144 --> 02:18:02,480
and pious people
goes to Divino Amore.

1537
02:18:02,549 --> 02:18:05,382
It was a well-known pilgrimage spot
for Romans...

1538
02:18:05,452 --> 02:18:09,252
where they sing special songs
in honor of the Virgin.

1539
02:18:09,323 --> 02:18:11,416
All of this caused a great scandal...

1540
02:18:11,492 --> 02:18:13,483
because there were people arriving
on a real pilgrimage...

1541
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:15,824
and there was Fellini's
staged pilgrimage.

1542
02:18:15,929 --> 02:18:17,692
Believe me, it was a mess.

1543
02:18:17,798 --> 02:18:22,929
There were some
American Catholic women...

1544
02:18:23,003 --> 02:18:24,971
who started to scream...

1545
02:18:25,072 --> 02:18:28,200
when they saw these women arriving
with tons of lipstick...

1546
02:18:28,275 --> 02:18:32,336
lots of cleavage, fishnet stockings,
and all the rest.

1547
02:18:32,413 --> 02:18:34,643
We had to stop the film
after half a day...

1548
02:18:34,715 --> 02:18:37,275
because they complained
to the priest...

1549
02:18:37,351 --> 02:18:39,581
who was pretending
not to see any of it.

1550
02:18:39,653 --> 02:18:43,089
They had probably been paid
in exchange for the right to film there.

1551
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:46,726
It caused a terrible scene
with the local archbishops.

1552
02:18:46,794 --> 02:18:50,195
They stopped the movie.
There were a lot of private talks.

1553
02:18:50,297 --> 02:18:52,561
I didn't understand very well
how they worked everything out.

1554
02:18:52,666 --> 02:18:56,568
We asked the local priest...

1555
02:18:56,637 --> 02:19:02,598
or maybe it was the priest
in charge of the pilgrimage.

1556
02:19:02,843 --> 02:19:06,370
We told him, "You've got
some real sinners here.

1557
02:19:06,447 --> 02:19:08,915
"You're a Catholic, a Christian.

1558
02:19:08,982 --> 02:19:13,214
"You're going to try to convert them.
You're going to preach a great sermon.

1559
02:19:13,287 --> 02:19:15,847
"We're going to film
while you go up in the pulpit...

1560
02:19:15,923 --> 02:19:18,483
"and preach to these people
about sin and redemption...

1561
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:20,959
"about miracles and divine grace."

1562
02:19:21,195 --> 02:19:24,187
So we watched and filmed--

1563
02:19:24,298 --> 02:19:28,428
I can't remember whether we filmed--

1564
02:19:28,535 --> 02:19:33,302
this long scene which is the sermon
of this simple priest...

1565
02:19:33,373 --> 02:19:35,671
who we were making fun of.

1566
02:19:35,742 --> 02:19:40,645
So, thanks to all of that,
we were able to keep filming...

1567
02:19:40,714 --> 02:19:43,410
thanks to the preacher's sermon.

1568
02:19:43,717 --> 02:19:47,676
There are lots of anecdotes
because we stayed...

1569
02:19:47,754 --> 02:19:49,483
three weeks at the Divino Amore.

1570
02:19:49,556 --> 02:19:53,083
It was endless filming, very unpleasant,
very tiring.

1571
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:57,621
It took a very long time
at the Divino Amore.

1572
02:19:59,933 --> 02:20:05,303
Not all the women playing prostitutes
were actually prostitutes.

1573
02:20:05,372 --> 02:20:07,533
Everybody had a small role.

1574
02:20:07,608 --> 02:20:09,906
I came across a picture--
I played a priest.

1575
02:20:09,977 --> 02:20:13,071
Here it is. It's funny.

1576
02:20:13,147 --> 02:20:16,116
I'm an Italian priest.

1577
02:20:16,183 --> 02:20:18,344
If you like, you can have it later.

1578
02:20:21,054 --> 02:20:25,457
The scandal at the Divino Amore
was not easily resolved.

1579
02:20:25,526 --> 02:20:28,461
It was more difficult
than what I just told you.

1580
02:20:28,529 --> 02:20:33,193
They had to interrupt the movie
and have prelates intervene.

1581
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:38,602
I remember we went to see
a monsignor, a bishop...

1582
02:20:38,672 --> 02:20:44,133
a Cardinal Siri, who later became
the cardinal archbishop of Genoa...

1583
02:20:44,211 --> 02:20:46,941
a great man, very intelligent,
who almost became the pope...

1584
02:20:47,014 --> 02:20:50,643
instead of John XXIII.

1585
02:20:50,717 --> 02:20:55,620
He was a very important man
whom Fellini convinced...

1586
02:20:55,789 --> 02:21:01,785
not to prohibit filming
in that church.

1587
02:21:02,696 --> 02:21:08,464
After all these steps,
we were able to film in peace.

1588
02:21:09,403 --> 02:21:12,167
As far as the Catholic Church
was concerned...

1589
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:14,639
Fellini was not suspect.

1590
02:21:14,708 --> 02:21:17,108
There were some problems
with La Dolce Vita...

1591
02:21:17,177 --> 02:21:19,611
because it was
a totally different atmosphere.

1592
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:22,205
But in Nights of Cabiria,...

1593
02:21:22,282 --> 02:21:26,719
there is a deep humanity...

1594
02:21:26,787 --> 02:21:28,618
in the tradition of Dostoyevsky.

1595
02:21:28,689 --> 02:21:33,820
There is a feeling of divine grace
and redemption...

1596
02:21:33,894 --> 02:21:39,457
and so the film has even been
considered a Christian film.

1597
02:21:39,566 --> 02:21:41,534
It was regarded in France...

1598
02:21:41,602 --> 02:21:45,629
and in Italy, after some hesitation...

1599
02:21:45,739 --> 02:21:49,072
as a Catholic film.

1600
02:21:50,410 --> 02:21:55,177
Actually, there's a scene
that no longer exists...

1601
02:21:55,249 --> 02:21:57,410
that they've rediscovered,
I think in Paris...

1602
02:21:57,484 --> 02:22:00,385
the scene of the man with the sack
that we filmed.

1603
02:22:00,454 --> 02:22:02,388
I remember it perfectly.

1604
02:22:04,625 --> 02:22:08,117
It was a character I hadn't met
but who was talked about in Rome...

1605
02:22:08,195 --> 02:22:12,154
who was a benefactor
who spent his time...

1606
02:22:12,232 --> 02:22:15,759
helping the people who lived
in vacant lots.

1607
02:22:15,869 --> 02:22:20,533
He carried a sack full of food
and basic necessities.

1608
02:22:21,775 --> 02:22:23,766
That's why he was called
"the man with the sack."

1609
02:22:23,844 --> 02:22:27,507
Fellini had heard about this man
and was impressed.

1610
02:22:27,581 --> 02:22:32,382
It was like "Father Pierre"
in France...

1611
02:22:32,452 --> 02:22:38,448
who had a great reputation
for his devotion to the poor.

1612
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:44,197
So he got the idea
of portraying this man in the film...

1613
02:22:44,264 --> 02:22:47,256
and, once again,
instead of hiring an actor...

1614
02:22:47,367 --> 02:22:51,167
he asked his editor to play the part...

1615
02:22:51,238 --> 02:22:55,140
with whom he was in contact
editing the film every day.

1616
02:22:55,208 --> 02:22:58,575
He asked Leo Cattozzo, his editor,
who was completely surprised...

1617
02:22:58,645 --> 02:23:03,173
who had never been in a movie,
to play the man with the sack.

1618
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:06,219
At one point he thought about
having me play his assistant...

1619
02:23:06,286 --> 02:23:09,619
because the man with the sack went
around with one or two young men...

1620
02:23:09,690 --> 02:23:12,625
who helped him carry the food.

1621
02:23:12,693 --> 02:23:15,127
In the end, he played the part alone.

1622
02:23:15,195 --> 02:23:20,861
So we filmed in the actual places
where the man with the sack worked.

1623
02:23:20,967 --> 02:23:22,992
It was on the outskirts of Rome...

1624
02:23:23,103 --> 02:23:27,472
where there were vacant lots
with natural caves...

1625
02:23:27,607 --> 02:23:31,099
where poor, old women lived...

1626
02:23:31,178 --> 02:23:35,342
who often were also prostitutes.

1627
02:23:35,415 --> 02:23:40,284
So it's those kind of people
who played the role...

1628
02:23:40,354 --> 02:23:42,254
of those saved
by the man with the sack.

1629
02:23:42,322 --> 02:23:44,017
So we filmed that scene.

1630
02:23:44,091 --> 02:23:46,651
It wasn't a very long scene,
but I remember it very well.

1631
02:23:46,727 --> 02:23:49,560
And it was included in the film.

1632
02:23:49,629 --> 02:23:54,225
I returned to France, and I went down
to Cannes for the festival--

1633
02:23:54,334 --> 02:23:57,929
I don't remember if it was
'57 or '56--

1634
02:23:59,106 --> 02:24:03,133
for the world premiere
of the film...

1635
02:24:03,210 --> 02:24:07,909
and I realized that the scene
of the man with the sack was not in it.

1636
02:24:09,483 --> 02:24:11,678
Other things were missing too.

1637
02:24:11,752 --> 02:24:15,188
Certain changes had been made
from the original version.

1638
02:24:15,255 --> 02:24:17,120
I didn't worry too much about it.

1639
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:22,253
Fellini told me that by agreement
with Dino De Laurentiis--

1640
02:24:22,329 --> 02:24:26,197
They were very anxious.

1641
02:24:26,266 --> 02:24:29,258
They attached a lot of importance
to the Cannes Festival...

1642
02:24:29,369 --> 02:24:32,167
which was very intense...

1643
02:24:32,239 --> 02:24:36,403
sophisticated and unpredictable.

1644
02:24:36,610 --> 02:24:41,138
They didn't want it to be too long,
so they cut that scene.

1645
02:24:41,214 --> 02:24:46,675
Later I was very surprised to hear
people say that it was cut...

1646
02:24:46,753 --> 02:24:49,722
because of censorship
by the Catholic Church.

1647
02:24:49,790 --> 02:24:53,123
I never heard that...

1648
02:24:53,193 --> 02:24:56,924
and I don't see how...

1649
02:24:57,030 --> 02:25:00,466
the portrayal of a kind man
doing charitable work...

1650
02:25:02,936 --> 02:25:05,871
could harm the Catholic Church
and create a problem.

1651
02:25:05,939 --> 02:25:07,907
But we talked about that last year...

1652
02:25:07,974 --> 02:25:10,807
when I was interviewed
about this new version...

1653
02:25:10,877 --> 02:25:13,277
of Nights of Cabiria
in the United States...

1654
02:25:13,346 --> 02:25:15,211
in which they had reinserted
the scene...

1655
02:25:15,282 --> 02:25:17,147
of the man with the sack
that they rediscovered in Paris.

1656
02:25:22,326 --> 02:25:24,851
It all began for me in Venice...

1657
02:25:25,763 --> 02:25:29,164
when La Strada was shown
at the festival.

1658
02:25:29,233 --> 02:25:32,600
I didn't know anything about Fellini,
I hadn't seen any of his films...

1659
02:25:32,669 --> 02:25:36,332
but my craving for films
led me to see...

1660
02:25:36,407 --> 02:25:39,604
three or four a day at festivals.

1661
02:25:39,676 --> 02:25:43,544
I was in the first row
to see La Strada...

1662
02:25:43,614 --> 02:25:46,378
because the theater was full.

1663
02:25:46,450 --> 02:25:52,446
From the first images, I was stunned
by its beauty and poetic density.

1664
02:25:53,957 --> 02:25:55,925
Right up to the end of the film...

1665
02:25:56,026 --> 02:26:00,656
I felt I was seeing
something staggering...

1666
02:26:00,731 --> 02:26:02,358
that was going to leave its mark
on my life.

1667
02:26:02,533 --> 02:26:05,969
I didn't realize that this movie
which had excited me so much...

1668
02:26:06,036 --> 02:26:07,503
had very much disappointed
the audience.

1669
02:26:07,571 --> 02:26:12,975
But I was so hypnotized by the images
that I felt something was happening...

1670
02:26:13,043 --> 02:26:15,375
in the theater,
but I didn't know what.

1671
02:26:15,446 --> 02:26:17,914
Towards the end of the movie...

1672
02:26:17,981 --> 02:26:23,078
I began to hear
a long whistling sound...

1673
02:26:23,153 --> 02:26:26,418
like a train whistle
that carries on and on.

1674
02:26:26,523 --> 02:26:29,492
It was people who couldn't stand
the film who had begun to whistle.

1675
02:26:29,593 --> 02:26:31,993
When the lights came up...

1676
02:26:32,062 --> 02:26:35,998
I felt I had been melted down
by the emotion.

1677
02:26:36,066 --> 02:26:38,296
I turned around and saw
the theater was half empty.

1678
02:26:39,570 --> 02:26:43,370
I said to myself, "This is
a very important day in my life.

1679
02:26:44,741 --> 02:26:48,142
"This Mr. Fellini must be very unhappy,
wherever he is."

1680
02:26:49,213 --> 02:26:53,673
He had to know
there was one person...

1681
02:26:54,017 --> 02:26:57,544
who had gotten it 1 00 percent.

1682
02:26:57,955 --> 02:27:00,947
So I set out to find the filmmaker.

1683
02:27:01,358 --> 02:27:03,849
They told me,
"It's that gentleman over there."

1684
02:27:03,961 --> 02:27:05,986
I left the theater.
He was walking quickly.

1685
02:27:06,897 --> 02:27:11,163
I saw a tall man,
a little stooped over...

1686
02:27:11,235 --> 02:27:14,170
and behind him was a little woman
who I recognized as being Gelsomina...

1687
02:27:14,238 --> 02:27:19,540
that is, Giulietta Masina,
in a big dress like a dancer's tutu...

1688
02:27:19,610 --> 02:27:22,340
Iooking a little out of style,
a little ridiculous.

1689
02:27:22,412 --> 02:27:26,075
She was crying heavily,
with tears streaming down.

1690
02:27:26,149 --> 02:27:29,983
I asked her, "Who is Mr. Fellini?"
and she said, "That's him."

1691
02:27:30,053 --> 02:27:32,715
I went up to Fellini and asked him,
"Do you speak French?"

1692
02:27:32,823 --> 02:27:36,020
He said no, rather unpleasantly.

1693
02:27:36,159 --> 02:27:41,392
But I insisted, because at that age
one is very stubborn and confident.

1694
02:27:41,465 --> 02:27:45,561
I told him-- in French all the same,
but he understood--

1695
02:27:45,636 --> 02:27:48,230
"It's the most beautiful film
at the festival...

1696
02:27:48,305 --> 02:27:50,933
"perhaps the most beautiful film
I've ever seen."

1697
02:27:51,008 --> 02:27:54,739
And I left him to his dismay
and his distress.

1698
02:27:55,145 --> 02:27:57,875
I saw him two days later,
and he was feeling a little better.

1699
02:27:57,948 --> 02:28:00,644
We talked, and a great understanding
connected us.

1700
02:28:00,717 --> 02:28:03,117
I won't tell the whole story...

1701
02:28:03,186 --> 02:28:06,917
of our friendship
that lasted for so long...

1702
02:28:07,024 --> 02:28:11,154
but which was also professional,
as I was his assistant for five years...

1703
02:28:11,261 --> 02:28:16,631
on three films:
II Bidone, Nights of Cabiria...

1704
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:18,793
and La Dolce Vita.

1705
02:28:19,670 --> 02:28:23,003
It was the same year
that Visconti's film Senso was shown.

1706
02:28:23,273 --> 02:28:29,269
I was not part of that feud.

1707
02:28:29,346 --> 02:28:34,511
Visconti's assistants,
Rosi and Zeffirelli--

1708
02:28:36,253 --> 02:28:40,690
I don't know if it was instigated
by Visconti or by themselves--

1709
02:28:40,757 --> 02:28:45,421
had caused a scandal
by demonstrating...

1710
02:28:45,495 --> 02:28:48,464
their disapproval during the film.

1711
02:28:48,832 --> 02:28:52,495
There was a kind of a war,
if you will...

1712
02:28:52,569 --> 02:28:57,734
between Fellini's assistants
and Visconti's.

1713
02:28:57,808 --> 02:29:01,972
The feud between Fellini and Visconti
went on for a very long time.

1714
02:29:02,045 --> 02:29:05,071
When I was Fellini's assistant,
I was not to speak about Visconti.

1715
02:29:05,148 --> 02:29:07,480
One day I very unwisely mentioned
that I had seen Senso...

1716
02:29:07,551 --> 02:29:09,018
and that it was a beautiful movie.

1717
02:29:09,086 --> 02:29:13,250
He looked at me and said, "You're sick.
What's the matter with you?"

1718
02:29:13,357 --> 02:29:14,722
I never did it again.

1719
02:29:14,791 --> 02:29:19,558
I learned that,
upon Visconti's death...

1720
02:29:19,630 --> 02:29:21,723
Fellini acted very kindly.

1721
02:29:21,798 --> 02:29:25,962
I was happy to see this reconciliation
between these two great men.

1722
02:29:26,770 --> 02:29:32,003
To get back to my story,
I came back to Paris, of course...

1723
02:29:32,075 --> 02:29:34,202
and I waited and waited
for word from Fellini...

1724
02:29:34,277 --> 02:29:37,337
because I had told him,
"I want to work in the movies.

1725
02:29:37,414 --> 02:29:39,541
"I want to be your assistant."

1726
02:29:39,616 --> 02:29:42,449
We always used the informal form
for "you" in speaking to each other...

1727
02:29:42,519 --> 02:29:45,454
which was not at all
the custom of the French at the time...

1728
02:29:45,555 --> 02:29:49,218
especially for those of my education,
my lifestyle.

1729
02:29:49,326 --> 02:29:51,760
I was thrown
into a kind of relationship...

1730
02:29:51,828 --> 02:29:53,193
that I had never experienced before:

1731
02:29:53,263 --> 02:29:56,960
very intimate, very direct
and very intense...

1732
02:29:58,035 --> 02:30:03,439
very unlike what I experienced
in Paris, even with parents and friends.

1733
02:30:04,441 --> 02:30:07,376
So I waited for word from Fellini.

1734
02:30:07,444 --> 02:30:11,813
One day he sent me a telegram.
I had given up on it by then.

1735
02:30:11,882 --> 02:30:15,079
Actually, it had started off badly
because he first sent me a letter...

1736
02:30:15,152 --> 02:30:19,919
saying he couldn't take me because of
some laws-- it was a bit of an alibi--

1737
02:30:20,023 --> 02:30:24,756
that prohibited using foreigners.

1738
02:30:25,562 --> 02:30:28,463
I was very unhappy.
A few days later he felt bad about it.

1739
02:30:28,532 --> 02:30:30,227
I wrote him a letter that he liked.

1740
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:32,325
It was not at all calculated
on my part...

1741
02:30:32,402 --> 02:30:36,304
but often sincerity pays greater rewards
than scheming.

1742
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:39,538
So I received this telegram here
in which he asked me to come.

1743
02:30:39,609 --> 02:30:42,077
I don't know if I should read it.

1744
02:30:42,145 --> 02:30:47,845
Anyway, he says, "I'm waiting for you.
Call me as soon as you arrive."

1745
02:30:48,118 --> 02:30:51,053
And so the adventure began.
I jumped on a train.

1746
02:30:51,121 --> 02:30:53,919
They had started filming
eight days earlier.

1747
02:30:55,125 --> 02:31:00,324
So I became this assistant
without being an assistant...

1748
02:31:00,397 --> 02:31:02,456
meaning I didn't really know
what he wanted from me.

1749
02:31:02,532 --> 02:31:05,831
I spoke Italian very poorly.

1750
02:31:07,370 --> 02:31:10,464
The crew saw this little French man...

1751
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:13,839
and wondered
what he was doing there.

1752
02:31:13,910 --> 02:31:16,435
And I was a little self-conscious
as well.

1753
02:31:16,546 --> 02:31:21,142
It took a long time to figure out
what he wanted from me.

1754
02:31:21,218 --> 02:31:23,243
Not a traditional assistant
in any sense...

1755
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:27,188
because he already had those, and
they were much more efficient than I...

1756
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:32,455
even though I was ready and willing
to do anything he wanted to help him.

1757
02:31:33,730 --> 02:31:37,393
My presence was more meaningful
when French actors arrived...

1758
02:31:37,467 --> 02:31:39,025
like Franois Prier.

1759
02:31:39,102 --> 02:31:42,833
For later films there were a lot of
French actors, such as Anouk Aime.

1760
02:31:42,906 --> 02:31:45,807
So this was my special role.

1761
02:31:45,876 --> 02:31:51,143
But the reason he wanted me around
has always been a mystery to me.

1762
02:31:51,715 --> 02:31:57,119
Even after his death, I wonder
how to explain my Fellini adventure...

1763
02:31:57,187 --> 02:32:01,248
because it was unusual
to take on this young man.

1764
02:32:02,159 --> 02:32:04,787
I didn't consider myself
irreplaceable...

1765
02:32:04,895 --> 02:32:10,561
but I held for him
a kind of superstitious value...

1766
02:32:10,634 --> 02:32:14,661
almost like a good-luck charm...

1767
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:22,107
a kind of gift
that I was not aware of.

1768
02:32:24,481 --> 02:32:28,747
In Nights of Cabiria
and II Bidone...

1769
02:32:28,919 --> 02:32:34,880
I think there was a range of skills
that I brought...

1770
02:32:35,091 --> 02:32:37,218
that to me seemed very banal...

1771
02:32:37,327 --> 02:32:40,490
but which to him seemed exotic...

1772
02:32:40,564 --> 02:32:43,362
because I came
from another place...

1773
02:32:43,433 --> 02:32:47,062
and I evoked a world
that aroused his interest.

1774
02:32:47,537 --> 02:32:50,005
This was less important
in La Dolce Vita...

1775
02:32:50,073 --> 02:32:51,973
which was the last film
I did with him...

1776
02:32:52,075 --> 02:32:54,976
because the world of La Dolce Vita
was very different...

1777
02:32:55,045 --> 02:33:01,041
from that of Nights of Cabiria
and II Bidone.

1778
02:33:02,252 --> 02:33:06,689
If I may take it further, it was perhaps
a feeling of spirituality.

1779
02:33:06,756 --> 02:33:11,557
It's funny, because when he would
do drawings of me...

1780
02:33:11,628 --> 02:33:15,689
he would put wings on my back
and a halo around my head.

1781
02:33:15,932 --> 02:33:17,957
When he had me work
on Nights of Cabiria...

1782
02:33:18,034 --> 02:33:22,698
he cast me as the priest
in the pilgrimage scene.

1783
02:33:22,772 --> 02:33:25,172
So I represented for him...

1784
02:33:25,242 --> 02:33:29,679
a kind of purity of adolescence...

1785
02:33:29,746 --> 02:33:32,306
which he made use of
without me realizing it.

1786
02:33:32,449 --> 02:33:35,316
Sometimes, at the end of a scene...

1787
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:41,848
he'd turn and look at me
to see my expression...

1788
02:33:42,993 --> 02:33:45,518
whether I was happy or unhappy.

1789
02:33:45,729 --> 02:33:49,165
For me it was beyond
my wildest dreams.

1790
02:33:49,232 --> 02:33:50,699
I was living a fairy tale.

1791
02:33:50,767 --> 02:33:53,429
The fact I had been chosen
by this great genius...

1792
02:33:53,503 --> 02:33:55,801
me, the little French guy
who didn't know anything.

1793
02:33:56,139 --> 02:34:01,133
I felt like I had a magic wand,
though, of course, I really didn't.

1794
02:34:01,211 --> 02:34:03,042
And so it went on for five years.

1795
02:34:08,245 --> 02:34:13,205
One day I saw
this young man, Pasolini...

1796
02:34:13,317 --> 02:34:14,784
arrive on the set.

1797
02:34:14,885 --> 02:34:16,716
He was not supposed to be
in the first team.

1798
02:34:16,787 --> 02:34:20,018
In the beginning,
Flaiano and Pinelli...

1799
02:34:20,091 --> 02:34:23,060
were Fellini's faithful collaborators...

1800
02:34:23,127 --> 02:34:26,028
that I met and became friends with...

1801
02:34:26,964 --> 02:34:29,091
and who were helping write
the screenplay.

1802
02:34:29,166 --> 02:34:32,658
And in this film,
Nights of Cabiria...

1803
02:34:32,737 --> 02:34:36,605
there was a milieu that neither
Fellini, nor I, nor the others...

1804
02:34:36,674 --> 02:34:39,768
were familiar with...

1805
02:34:39,877 --> 02:34:42,846
the world of prostitution...

1806
02:34:42,913 --> 02:34:46,212
that whole world of pimps.

1807
02:34:47,551 --> 02:34:52,250
Pasolini had written--
I don't remember the name--

1808
02:34:52,323 --> 02:34:53,790
He had not yet made any films--

1809
02:34:53,858 --> 02:34:59,091
He had collaborated
with some filmmakers--

1810
02:34:59,163 --> 02:35:04,692
I Ragazzi di Mala Vita,
I think it was.

1811
02:35:04,769 --> 02:35:08,705
So he was already known
and had a kind of dark reputation.

1812
02:35:09,573 --> 02:35:12,269
So Fellini asked him to come
and help him.

1813
02:35:12,376 --> 02:35:16,574
So I saw this gentleman arrive,
this young man...

1814
02:35:16,647 --> 02:35:18,979
I witnessed their conversation.

1815
02:35:19,050 --> 02:35:24,920
Often conversations with Fellini
took place in the car.

1816
02:35:24,989 --> 02:35:29,949
When Fellini had something
to say to somebody...

1817
02:35:30,027 --> 02:35:31,892
often we would go for a drive
in the car.

1818
02:35:31,962 --> 02:35:35,796
Very often I found myself alone
with Fellini in the Roman countryside...

1819
02:35:35,866 --> 02:35:39,632
speaking endlessly about life
and everything.

1820
02:35:39,703 --> 02:35:43,036
This is what happened
with Pasolini.

1821
02:35:43,107 --> 02:35:45,940
I was sitting in the back seat,
not saying anything.

1822
02:35:46,043 --> 02:35:51,606
They were discussing what dialogue
they would give to the prostitutes...

1823
02:35:51,715 --> 02:35:55,913
but especially to the men, because
Pasolini hung around with men...

1824
02:35:55,986 --> 02:36:01,424
homosexuals, pimps...

1825
02:36:01,492 --> 02:36:04,757
bisexuals, androgynous people...

1826
02:36:04,829 --> 02:36:07,229
but that's not really in
Nights of Cabiria.

1827
02:36:07,765 --> 02:36:12,395
So that went just fine.
It was an important contribution.

1828
02:36:12,470 --> 02:36:14,165
I think they remained
on very good terms.

1829
02:36:14,238 --> 02:36:19,403
And Pasolini went on to have
his own brilliant career...

1830
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:22,240
in his unique style.
