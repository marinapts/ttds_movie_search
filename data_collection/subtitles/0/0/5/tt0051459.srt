1
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:32,006
We want Pollitt. Brick Pollitt.

2
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:33,201
We want Pollitt.

3
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:34,771
Brick Pollitt.

4
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,281
Don't you do that!

5
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:08,609
I'm warning you, Trixie.

6
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:09,449
Gooper!

7
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:12,849
Can't you stop your child
from putting her hands in the ice cream?

8
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:19,765
Couldn't you at least wash your hands
before you did that?

9
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:31,802
Maggie!

10
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,843
You stop that!

11
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,407
How could you do that to a child?

12
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:39,162
Like this, honey.

13
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,562
Did you see what she did?

14
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:52,764
I told her to wash her hands first.

15
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:10,927
One of those no-neck monsters
hit me with some ice cream.

16
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:14,251
Why do you call Gooper's kiddies
"no-neck monsters"?

17
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:17,290
Because your brother's children
have got no necks.

18
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:23,201
Their fat little heads sit on their fat bodies
without a bit of connection.

19
00:05:23,372 --> 00:05:24,725
That's too bad.

20
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:28,561
Especially 'cause, if they have no necks
you can't wring them. Right, honey?

21
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:33,528
Here we are!

22
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,051
Come on, Buster, Sonny.

23
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,521
Go get in the car. We're all going to go.

24
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:42,530
Did you ever hear so many dog's names
tagged on to children?

25
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:46,088
They've got five monsters
and number six coming up.

26
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:49,967
They've brought the whole bunch here
like animals to display at a county fair.

27
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,402
It's so obvious, it's disgusting.

28
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:54,250
It's obvious what they're up to.

29
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,002
What are they up to, Maggie?

30
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,360
I'll tell you what they're up to, boy of mine.

31
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:04,689
They're up to cutting you out
of your father's estate.

32
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,682
Everybody knows Big Daddy's...

33
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,530
...dying of...

34
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:13,848
I ought to send Sister Woman a bill
for a new pair of stockings.

35
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:15,481
Do we?

36
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:16,847
Do we what?

37
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:20,810
Know that Big Daddy is dying of...

38
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:23,124
Don't you believe it?

39
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:25,284
You'll know soon enough.

40
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:27,210
Suppose he is?

41
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:29,209
There's some things you've got to face.

42
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:32,443
There's some things in this world
you've simply got to face.

43
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,764
Why was Big Daddy in that horrible clinic
for six weeks...

44
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:38,082
...if the examination didn't show anything?

45
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:42,165
Why did Brother Man bring his whole tribe
down here in this sticky heat?

46
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:45,371
And why so many allusions
to you and Rainbow Hill?

47
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:47,770
You know what Rainbow Hill is?

48
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:51,487
It's a place that's famous for treating
famous alcoholics and dope fiends.

49
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:52,846
I'm not famous.

50
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:53,768
No...

51
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,604
...and you don't take dope.

52
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:58,372
Otherwise you'd be a perfect candidate
for Rainbow Hill.

53
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:01,689
That's where Brother Man's
going to tell Big Daddy to ship you.

54
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:04,129
Over my dead body!

55
00:07:04,652 --> 00:07:06,483
Rainbow Hill.

56
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:12,324
With you out of the way,
Gooper gets hold of the estate...

57
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,808
...signs the checks, and cuts off our credit
whenever he wants.

58
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:18,003
How'd you like that, baby?

59
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,010
You're doing just about everything...

60
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:23,767
...to aid and abet them
in grabbing control, after Big Daddy...

61
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:31,445
Well, you are.

62
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:34,651
Quitting work,
devoting yourself to drinking!

63
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:37,810
Breaking your ankle last night
on the high school field.

64
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:40,201
Brick?

65
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:43,642
We've got one thing on our side.

66
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,281
No, two things.

67
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:47,050
Are my seams straight?

68
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,889
Big Daddy dotes on you, honey.

69
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:52,925
He just can't stand Brother Man
and his wife...

70
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,282
...that fertility monster.
She's odious to him.

71
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,482
I can tell.

72
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,967
Just like I can tell he likes me.

73
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:01,891
That's the second thing
we've got on our side.

74
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:08,883
He likes me.

75
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:13,567
The way he looks me up and down,
and over...

76
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:16,483
He's still got an eye for girls.

77
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:18,683
That kind of talk is disgusting.

78
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:23,568
Anybody ever tell you
you were a back-aching Puritan?

79
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:27,163
I think it's mighty fine how that old fellow,
on death's doorstep...

80
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:30,642
...takes in my shape with what
I consider deserved appreciation.

81
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:36,648
Gooper still cherishes the illusion
he took a giant step up the social ladder...

82
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:40,128
...when he married Mae Flynn
of the no-neck Memphis Flynns...

83
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:42,892
...because she was queen
of the Cotton Carnival.

84
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:45,845
I can just see Gooper
falling for Her Majesty...

85
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:50,011
...sitting on that brass throne,
riding that tacky float down Main Street...

86
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:54,922
...smiling and bowing, and blowing kisses
to all the trash on the street.

87
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:57,968
You know what happened to her?

88
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,845
No, what happened to her?

89
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:03,604
Somebody spat tobacco juice in her face.

90
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:07,248
Some drunk at the Hotel Gayoso
leaned out the window and said:

91
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:10,171
"Hey, Queenie! "

92
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:13,648
Sister Mae looked up and smiled
and waved...

93
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,969
...and that drunk shot a squirt
of tobacco juice...

94
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:19,088
...right in her face.

95
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,729
Why are you looking at me like that?

96
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,649
Like what?

97
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,929
Like you were just looking.

98
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,242
I wasn't conscious of looking at you.

99
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:47,521
I was conscious of it.

100
00:09:57,652 --> 00:10:00,246
- Lf you were thinking the same thing...
- No, Maggie!

101
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:02,886
- Why not?
- Will you please keep your voice down?

102
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,371
No!

103
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:07,523
I know you better than you think.

104
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,529
I've seen that look before...

105
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:11,484
...and I know what it used to mean.

106
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:16,049
- And it still means the same thing now.
- You're not the same woman now, Maggie.

107
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:18,647
Don't you think I know that?

108
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:21,406
- Don't you think I know...
- Know what, Maggie?

109
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:24,849
That I've gone through
this horrible transformation.

110
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,202
I've become hard and frantic and cruel.

111
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:29,806
Are you planning on meeting
Big Daddy's plane?

112
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,569
I get so lonely.

113
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:41,889
Everybody gets that.

114
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,366
Living with somebody you love can be...

115
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:49,291
...lonelier than living entirely alone...

116
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:52,482
...when the one you love doesn't love you.

117
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:06,244
You can't even stand
drinking out of the same glass, can you?

118
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:07,686
Would you like to live alone?

119
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:08,882
No!

120
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:16,563
No, I wouldn't.

121
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:22,286
Why can't you lose your good looks, Brick?

122
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:24,483
Most drinking men lose theirs.

123
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:26,210
Why can't you?

124
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:30,840
I think you've even got better looking
since you went on the bottle.

125
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:35,723
You were such a wonderful lover.

126
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:37,570
You'll be late!

127
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:40,402
You were so exciting to be in love with.

128
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,682
Mostly, I guess, because you were...

129
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:49,890
If I thought you'd...

130
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,925
...never make love to me again...

131
00:11:55,932 --> 00:12:00,528
...I'd find the longest, sharpest knife
and stick it straight into my heart.

132
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:03,004
I'd do that.

133
00:12:07,532 --> 00:12:10,729
How long does this have to go on,
this punishment?

134
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:13,611
Haven't I served my term?
Can I get a pardon?

135
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:18,562
Your finishing-school voice sounds like
you were running upstairs to say, "Fire! "

136
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,964
Is it any wonder?

137
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,768
You know what I feel like?

138
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:27,532
I feel all the time like a cat
on a hot tin roof.

139
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,284
Then jump off the roof, Maggie.

140
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:32,962
Cats jump off roofs and land uninjured.
Do it. Jump.

141
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:34,082
Jump where?

142
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,645
Into what?

143
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,410
Take a lover.

144
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,568
I don't deserve that!

145
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:50,252
I can't see any man but you.

146
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:54,968
Even with my eyes closed, I just see you.

147
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,922
Why can't you get ugly, Brick?

148
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:05,971
Why can't you get fat or ugly or something,
so I can stand it?

149
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:10,482
You'll make out fine.
Your kind always does.

150
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,648
I'm more determined than you think.

151
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:14,649
I'll win all right.

152
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:16,171
Win what?

153
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:20,801
What is the victory
of a cat on a hot tin roof?

154
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:27,366
Just staying on it, I guess...

155
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:29,443
...as long as she can.

156
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,845
Calm down. Not yet. Now wait a minute.

157
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,286
Where are the flowers?

158
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:47,841
Aren't you putting it on a little thick?

159
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:07,131
Get ready, now!

160
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:09,880
Mama, she didn't bring anything
for Big Daddy.

161
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:13,483
Pretty seedy looking flowers
for Big Daddy, huh, Gooper?

162
00:14:13,692 --> 00:14:14,920
I picked them myself.

163
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:16,963
Looks like she picked them off a grave.

164
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:21,284
Don't talk about graves when we don't
know if Big Daddy's going to live or die.

165
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:26,888
Get ready.

166
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,051
Hello, Mae.

167
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:35,765
Hello, children.

168
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:51,288
Doc, isn't it great?

169
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:57,049
Kiss me!

170
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:00,204
Kiss your grandmother.

171
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:02,251
Darling Big Daddy!

172
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:04,767
You look fine, Big Daddy.

173
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:07,488
Doc, do you want to tell them the news?

174
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:11,322
The exploratory operation proved
there's nothing wrong with Big Daddy.

175
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:12,647
Nothing at all!

176
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:15,561
Just a spastic colon. And that's all.

177
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:17,728
- Great news!
- Isn't that great news?

178
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,488
That's the best birthday present of all.

179
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:22,007
Where's Brick?

180
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,328
Uncle Brick got drunk and broke his leg.

181
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:25,885
- How?
- What's that?

182
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,970
Got drunk again and tried to jump
the high hurdles at 3:00 AM.

183
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:31,367
That poor boy still thinks he's an athlete.

184
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:33,449
Couldn't keep it out of the local paper.

185
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,885
AP got hold of it too.

186
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:36,610
Yeah, and UP...

187
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:40,487
...and thanks to your professional
legal advice, every other P.

188
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,160
Let's go home.

189
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,442
Don't you want to ride with the children?

190
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,926
No!

191
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,931
He's his sassy old self again, all right!

192
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,804
Be quiet, woman!

193
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,205
Hush up!

194
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:12,765
Welcome home, Cap'n Pollitt.

195
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:24,085
I'm going to live, Maggie. I'm going to live.

196
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:27,206
They had me real scared.

197
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,125
I've wasted so much time.

198
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:32,244
I've got a million different kinds
of feelings left in me.

199
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:36,047
And I'm going to use them.
I'm going to use them all.

200
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:17,328
Why did you and Brick
suddenly drive up from New Orleans?

201
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:19,363
For your birthday, what else?

202
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,689
I had one last year and the year before.
Didn't see you then.

203
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,962
You know how Brick is sometimes.

204
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:27,851
Maybe he thought he was coming
to my funeral instead.

205
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:31,010
Brick loves you! He does!

206
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,570
But does he love you?

207
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:38,371
What do you want? Proof?

208
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:40,884
If I was married to you three years...

209
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,083
...you'd have the living proof.

210
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,647
You'd have three kids
and a fourth in the oven.

211
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:51,130
Get me out of this. I want to talk to Brick.

212
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:00,451
He wants some more ice, Miss Margaret.

213
00:18:04,412 --> 00:18:05,367
"We love you when we're with you

214
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:07,324
"And we love you out of sight

215
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:13,890
"Big Mama, too"

216
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,725
I've got news, honey!

217
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:30,331
Big news.

218
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:32,608
Big Daddy's going to live.

219
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:37,326
That's right, he's a well man.

220
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:41,047
That's what Big Mama said and Dr. Baugh
was right there with them.

221
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,766
You should've seen Mae and Gooper's face.

222
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,726
They almost dropped dead
from shock themselves.

223
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:47,802
He's all right?

224
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,604
Feeling like 40...

225
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:50,966
...and talking like 20.

226
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:53,043
And we can drive back
to New Orleans tonight.

227
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,169
- I'm taking no chances on moving you.
- I won't break.

228
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:59,882
Or letting them poison
Big Daddy's mind against you.

229
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:04,491
I just want you to get dressed
and come to Big Daddy's birthday party.

230
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,969
First thing Big Daddy asked about was you.

231
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,732
Big Daddy! Now what makes him so big?

232
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,681
His big heart, his big belly...

233
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:15,120
...or his big money?

234
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:18,562
The heat has made you cross.

235
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,290
Give me my crutch.

236
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:25,121
Why don't you put on
your silk pyjamas, honey...

237
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,243
...and come on down to the party?

238
00:19:27,452 --> 00:19:29,647
There's a lovely cool breeze.

239
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:32,163
Give me my crutch, Maggie.

240
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:35,448
Lean on me, baby.

241
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,571
You've got a nice smell about you.

242
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,812
- Was your bathwater cool?
- No.

243
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:53,689
I know something
that would make you cool and fresh.

244
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:56,164
Alcohol rub.

245
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:58,086
Cologne.

246
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:00,371
No thanks. We'd smell alike.

247
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:02,920
Like a couple of cats in the heat.

248
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:14,404
It's cool on the lawn.

249
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:18,685
I am not going down there.
Not for you and not for Big Daddy!

250
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:23,329
At least give him this present...

251
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:26,922
...that I remembered to buy for you,
for his birthday.

252
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:29,363
Just write a few words on this card.

253
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:31,051
You write something.

254
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:34,688
It's got to be your handwriting.
It's your present.

255
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,245
I didn't get him a present.

256
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:37,680
What's the difference?

257
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:39,962
If there's no difference, you write the card!

258
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,885
- And have him know you didn't remember?
- I didn't remember!

259
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:45,008
You don't have to prove it to him!

260
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:47,282
Just write, "Love, Brick"...

261
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:48,641
...for heaven's sake!

262
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:51,690
- You've got to.
- I don't have to do anything!

263
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:55,009
You forget the conditions I agreed on
to stay living with you!

264
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:59,051
I'm not living with you.
We occupy the same cage, that's all!

265
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:11,364
That's the first time you've raised
your voice in a long time.

266
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:15,485
A crack in the stone wall?

267
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:24,005
I think that's a fine sign. Mighty fine.

268
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:30,686
What did you do that for?

269
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:37,132
To give us a little privacy for a while.

270
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:40,043
Don't make a fool of yourself.

271
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:46,571
I don't mind making a fool
of myself over you.

272
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:49,200
I mind. I feel embarrassed for you.

273
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:50,965
Feel embarrassed!

274
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,967
I can't live on this way.

275
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:57,045
- You agreed to accept that condition!
- I know I did, but I can't!

276
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,401
Let go.

277
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,290
Let go, Maggie!

278
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:26,720
Son!

279
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:32,010
We've got the most wonderful news
about Big Daddy!

280
00:22:32,372 --> 00:22:33,930
What's this door doing locked?

281
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:36,322
You think there's robbers in the house?

282
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:39,329
Brick's getting dressed, Big Mama.

283
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:40,806
He's still getting dressed.

284
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:43,924
It won't be the first time
I've seen Brick not dressed.

285
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:45,406
Open this door.

286
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:56,487
Brick, honey!

287
00:22:56,652 --> 00:22:58,370
Sweetheart, how does your leg feel?

288
00:22:58,572 --> 00:23:01,609
Come out of there. I want to give you
the news about Big Daddy.

289
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:03,808
I told him already.

290
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:05,923
I just hate locked doors in the house.

291
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:09,568
I know you do
but people need privacy, don't they?

292
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,842
No, ma'am, not in my house.

293
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:15,288
What did you take this off for?
It looked so sweet on you.

294
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,847
Not sweet enough
for Big Daddy's birthday party.

295
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:20,321
Out!

296
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:22,887
Out, you little monster!

297
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:33,443
Mae and Gooper are so touchy
about their children.

298
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,400
You hardly even dare suggest
there's any room for improvement.

299
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:39,091
Brick, hurry on out!

300
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,090
Shoot, Maggie, you just don't like children.

301
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:44,760
Why that's not true. I adore them.

302
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:46,087
Well brought up.

303
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:48,561
Why not have some, then,
and bring them up well?

304
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:51,485
- Instead of picking on theirs?
- Big Mama!

305
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:54,570
Hugh and Betsy have got to go.
They're waiting to say goodbye.

306
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:57,325
I'll be right down.
Tell them to hold their horses.

307
00:23:58,892 --> 00:23:59,768
Where's Brick?

308
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,845
What you said about having children...

309
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:14,003
It's still kind of a secret, but...

310
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:18,405
Shoot, Maggie! Stop playing so dumb.

311
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,683
Is he still drinking this stuff much?

312
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:25,125
- He may have had a little highball.
- Don't laugh about it.

313
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:28,244
Some men stop drinking when they marry.
Others start.

314
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:30,408
- He never drank before...
- That's not fair!

315
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:32,960
Fair or not, I want to ask you a question.

316
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,971
Do you make Brick happy?

317
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:37,411
Well?

318
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:42,326
- Why don't you ask if he makes me happy?
- I know...

319
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:43,401
It works both ways.

320
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:47,724
Something ain't right.
You're childless and my son drinks.

321
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:50,605
- We're leaving, Big Mama.
- I'm coming!

322
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:52,888
When a marriage goes on the rocks...

323
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,686
...the rocks are there, right there!

324
00:24:55,892 --> 00:24:57,166
Goodbye, Ida.

325
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,930
I'm coming.

326
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:06,843
That's not fair.

327
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:09,043
All right, I'm coming.

328
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,284
Is Brick here?

329
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,247
I thought I'd check his ankle.

330
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,165
Is it giving him much pain?

331
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:23,682
You know how Brick is, Doc.
He hardly ever complains.

332
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:27,447
Even when he had
that awful back injury in football.

333
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:31,721
Brick's birthday present for Big Daddy.

334
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,326
I think they're fixing
to sit down at the table.

335
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,764
You forgot to write out the card, honey.

336
00:25:45,772 --> 00:25:46,807
Thanks, Doc.

337
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:55,211
Can I get you something cool?

338
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:56,961
No, thanks.

339
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:59,090
How's the ankle?

340
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:03,364
Itches some.

341
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:07,642
Funny, that's the same leg
you tore a muscle in the...

342
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:09,280
'Bama State.

343
00:26:09,492 --> 00:26:10,925
Twenty-one to...

344
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:11,803
Nothing.

345
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:14,162
You miss football, don't you?

346
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,169
Hurt much when you put weight on it?

347
00:26:16,332 --> 00:26:17,321
Some.

348
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:21,002
Yeah, you were quite a team,
you and Skipper.

349
00:26:23,372 --> 00:26:24,964
What is it, Doc?

350
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:28,603
You didn't leave that party
to come up and discuss my health.

351
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:29,688
That's right.

352
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:32,240
- I've already heard the good news...
- It's bad news.

353
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:35,088
It's what we expected.

354
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:37,568
It's malignant and it's terminal.

355
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:39,649
He hasn't a chance.

356
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:42,810
- But Maggie said, and Big Mama...
- Lies.

357
00:26:43,372 --> 00:26:44,600
I lied to them.

358
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,727
I lied to him, too.

359
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:49,967
Professional ethics.

360
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:52,204
Gooper?

361
00:26:52,412 --> 00:26:54,926
I told him the truth
coming in from the airfield.

362
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:56,681
He's going to die.

363
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,971
He's going to die.

364
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:11,529
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam"

365
00:27:14,172 --> 00:27:16,481
What kind of truth is that?

366
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:37,964
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

367
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:40,606
"To shine for him each day

368
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:44,964
"In every way try to please him

369
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:47,686
"At home, at school, at play

370
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:49,925
"A sunbeam

371
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:54,890
"Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

372
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:57,966
"A sunbeam, a sunbeam

373
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:01,131
"I'll be a sunbeam for him"

374
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:02,731
Amen!

375
00:28:03,252 --> 00:28:06,050
- Did you like the singing, Big Daddy?
- Pass the black-eyed peas.

376
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:10,088
Look at Big Daddy eat!
Ain't it something to thank your stars for?

377
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:12,083
They've been practicing just for you.

378
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:13,366
Tell them to sit and eat.

379
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:15,329
- Children, come on.
- Over there!

380
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:17,443
Yeah. Over there.

381
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:19,884
Look here. Telegrams!

382
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:22,652
Hundreds of them from every corner
of this great state...

383
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:24,006
Wishing you happy birthday.

384
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:25,730
Do you want me to read them?

385
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:27,923
One from the governor and the senator...

386
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:31,049
It must be getting on to election time,
hey, Deacon?

387
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:33,806
Let's remember,
we're all lambs in the same pasture.

388
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,766
Everybody, including Big Daddy,
owes thanks to those in high places who...

389
00:28:37,972 --> 00:28:39,041
Gave us nothing!

390
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:43,091
Every scrap on this table was raised
right here on this place, Deacon.

391
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:47,490
I made a pastureland out of this place
when it was nothing but a swamp.

392
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,764
And it was done with the help of God,
and not any governor.

393
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:51,723
Amen.

394
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:53,729
"Boom, boom and it makes me crazy"

395
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,365
Great balls of fire!

396
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:56,721
Surprise!

397
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:59,844
- What are they up to now?
- It's part of the entertainment.

398
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:01,843
Don't they get any intermission?

399
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:03,531
That's funny!

400
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:05,365
That's very funny!

401
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,722
He don't mean it, Sister Woman.

402
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:10,400
- He loves children!
- Of course he does!

403
00:29:10,572 --> 00:29:12,483
Will you put some honey on this?

404
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:15,684
They're all Pollitts,
I'm proud to say, every one of them.

405
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:18,486
I know Big Daddy's
just as proud as we are...

406
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:20,808
...that there's a flesh-and-blood dynasty...

407
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:23,122
...waiting to take over.

408
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:25,323
That's no way to talk.

409
00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:26,328
What way?

410
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,411
"Take over." When we all know...

411
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:32,967
...Big Daddy's going to live
to be at least 100.

412
00:29:33,052 --> 00:29:34,610
I'll drink to that!

413
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:37,042
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere!

414
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:38,890
To Big Daddy!

415
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:42,886
In the name of every person
in this county...

416
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:46,362
...in the name of the church
and school board, the board of trustees...

417
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:49,524
...felicitations on your 65th birthday.

418
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,882
Brick, honey,
I brought you something to eat.

419
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,571
I'm not hungry.

420
00:29:57,932 --> 00:29:59,888
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:00,968
We're leaving.

422
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:02,890
- We can't.
- I can.

423
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,607
- The party's coming up here to you.
- I'll get one of the boys to drive me.

424
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:10,441
You just can't walk out
on Big Daddy's birthday party!

425
00:30:10,652 --> 00:30:12,290
Don't you care nothing about him?

426
00:30:12,372 --> 00:30:13,771
Get out of my way.

427
00:30:14,892 --> 00:30:17,167
Get out of my way, Maggie!

428
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,449
You've got no cause to dislike him.

429
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:25,011
Do I dislike him?

430
00:30:25,212 --> 00:30:29,091
It's obvious to everybody.
Especially to him.

431
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,650
What's he ever done to you?

432
00:30:34,852 --> 00:30:35,841
What?

433
00:30:36,052 --> 00:30:38,202
Why do you hate him so much?

434
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:39,925
What's he ever done to you?

435
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:44,408
Nothing.

436
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:48,366
What was Dr. Baugh doing up here?

437
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:51,370
What did he...

438
00:30:55,852 --> 00:30:58,047
That's right. Big Daddy is going to die.

439
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:03,367
I don't believe that.

440
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:06,645
Dr. Baugh wouldn't lie to Big Daddy.

441
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,126
Wouldn't he, Maggie?

442
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:14,728
Poor Big Daddy.

443
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:17,683
I'm fond of him.

444
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:20,486
I'm genuinely fond of that old man.

445
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:22,649
I really am, you know.

446
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,128
When he finds out...

447
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:29,447
I wouldn't want to be the one to tell him.

448
00:31:31,732 --> 00:31:33,211
That's why you want to go now.

449
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:37,240
Yeah, that's why I want to leave now.

450
00:31:39,852 --> 00:31:41,968
You've got to do this for me, Maggie.

451
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:44,481
And leave the field to Gooper and his wife?

452
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,607
No, sir!

453
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:47,325
Let's face facts, baby.

454
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,204
You're a drinker. That takes money.

455
00:31:49,412 --> 00:31:50,686
I don't want his money!

456
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:52,803
Are you ready to settle for ten-cent beer?

457
00:31:52,892 --> 00:31:55,929
That's what Gooper'll dole out to you
when they freeze you out.

458
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:58,282
They've got a plan, baby.

459
00:31:58,492 --> 00:32:02,804
You should've heard them
laying it on to Big Daddy. A mile a minute!

460
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:05,446
Big Mama's already on their side.

461
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:08,924
You're a drinker and I'm childless.

462
00:32:09,612 --> 00:32:13,048
We've got to beat that plan,
we've just got to!

463
00:32:15,972 --> 00:32:17,451
I've been so...

464
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:20,649
...disgustingly poor all my life.

465
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:23,447
That's the truth, Brick.

466
00:32:24,532 --> 00:32:26,409
Have you, Maggie?

467
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:30,249
You don't know what it's like to have to...

468
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:33,603
...suck up to people you can't stand,
just because they have money.

469
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,722
You don't know what it's like...

470
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:38,968
...never having any clothes.

471
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:42,002
That dress I married you in...

472
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:46,125
...was a hand-me-down
from a snotty, rich cousin I hated.

473
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:50,402
You can be young without money.

474
00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:53,762
But you can't be old without it.

475
00:32:56,212 --> 00:32:58,282
Where did I fail you?

476
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,082
Where did I make my mistake?

477
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:04,802
Make that your last drink
until after the party...

478
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:06,325
...please, honey.

479
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:16,009
I think I made my mistake
when I tried to tell you about Skipper.

480
00:33:16,332 --> 00:33:18,129
That's my fatal error.

481
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:20,448
- I never should...
- Shut up about Skipper!

482
00:33:20,652 --> 00:33:22,449
I mean it! Shut up!

483
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:25,212
The laws of silence won't work about that!

484
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:27,243
Not about Skipper and us.

485
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:31,161
It's like locking the door on a fire
to forget the house is burning.

486
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:32,810
Hey, everybody!

487
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:36,920
But not looking at a fire doesn't put it out.

488
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:41,802
This time I'm going to finish.
That night in the hotel room, Skipper...

489
00:33:41,892 --> 00:33:43,405
I don't want to hear about it!

490
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:46,246
Why won't you face the truth, just once...

491
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:49,449
...about Skipper, about me, about yourself?

492
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:52,643
Are you bringing that party up here or not?

493
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:54,211
Kit and caboodle, son.

494
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:57,165
That won't do any good.
I'm going to say this...

495
00:33:57,372 --> 00:34:00,170
...and I don't care if it's in front of them.

496
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:03,729
Do you want to be hit with this crutch?

497
00:34:03,812 --> 00:34:05,803
Are you still blaming me
for Skipper's death?

498
00:34:05,892 --> 00:34:07,484
I could kill you with this crutch.

499
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:09,842
Good Lord! Do you think I'd care?

500
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:12,885
Skipper and I had a friendship.
Why won't you let it alone?

501
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:15,202
- It's got to be told!
- I don't want to hear it!

502
00:34:15,412 --> 00:34:18,643
It's got to be told
and you never let me tell it. I love you...

503
00:34:18,852 --> 00:34:21,491
...and that's worth fighting for.
Not Skipper!

504
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,205
Skipper was no good!

505
00:34:23,412 --> 00:34:24,765
Maybe I'm no good.

506
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:26,121
Nobody's good.

507
00:34:26,332 --> 00:34:28,607
But Skipper is dead!

508
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:30,724
And I'm alive!

509
00:34:30,892 --> 00:34:32,769
Maggie the cat is alive!

510
00:34:32,972 --> 00:34:34,291
I'm alive!

511
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:36,403
Why are you afraid of the truth?

512
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:37,601
Truth?

513
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:48,727
Little girl, somebody ought to teach you...

514
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:51,605
...to knock before you open a door.

515
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:56,169
Otherwise, people might think
you're lacking in good breeding.

516
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:02,530
What's Uncle Brick doing on the floor?

517
00:35:03,612 --> 00:35:05,762
I tried to kill your Aunt Maggie...

518
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:10,246
...but I failed...

519
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:14,806
...and I fell. Little girl,
would you hand me my crutch, please?

520
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:22,645
What were you jumping high hurdles for?

521
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:26,801
Because I used to, and people like to do
what they used to do...

522
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,086
...after they've stopped being able to do it.

523
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:33,528
That's right. And that's your answer.

524
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:34,927
Now go away.

525
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:39,409
Stop that, you little no-neck monster!

526
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:43,844
You're just jealous
because you can't have babies.

527
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:53,846
You see?

528
00:35:55,332 --> 00:35:59,120
Mae and Gooper gloat over us
being childless...

529
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:03,722
...even in front of their little
no-neck monsters.

530
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:11,646
I went to a doctor in Memphis.

531
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:14,082
A gynaecologist.

532
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:18,761
He says there's no reason
why we can't have a child...

533
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:20,883
...whenever we want.

534
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:31,048
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Maggie, I hear you.

535
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:35,683
But how in hell do you imagine
you're going to have a child...

536
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:38,366
...by a man who cannot stand you?

537
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:48,168
That, boy of mine...

538
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:52,722
...is a problem I'll just have to work out.

539
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:55,321
Here comes that party, here we come!

540
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:58,330
Here comes that birthday party!

541
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:00,170
That's nice.

542
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:06,210
The preacher almost cried when I told him
I got a stained-glass memorial window.

543
00:37:06,412 --> 00:37:08,209
Who gave you that window, Deacon?

544
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:11,130
Clyde Fletcher's widow,
a generous woman of fine character.

545
00:37:11,332 --> 00:37:13,971
What someone should give our church
is a cooling system.

546
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:15,451
Yes, sir. Exactly my thought.

547
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:18,922
Let's see, they've had the typhoid shots
and the tetanus shots...

548
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:23,569
...diphtheria shots, hepatitis shots,
polio shots.

549
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:28,046
Gooper, what have all the kiddies
been shot for?

550
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:30,322
Everything but stealing chickens.

551
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:38,641
Well, Brick?

552
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:41,527
Congratulations, Big Daddy,
on your birthday.

553
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:44,405
- Bull!
- Guess what memorial Gus's family gave?

554
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:48,082
- A new house and basketball court...
- Deacon!

555
00:37:48,972 --> 00:37:52,089
What's all this talk about
memorial stained-glass windows?

556
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:55,045
Figuring on somebody kicking off
around here?

557
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:58,887
How about some nice music
to start the party off with?

558
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:04,602
Turn that damn thing off!

559
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:08,608
Where's my Brick?

560
00:38:08,692 --> 00:38:11,331
- Where's my precious baby?
- Sorry, turn it back on.

561
00:38:11,652 --> 00:38:13,210
How does your leg feel, honey?

562
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,762
Your hand was made for holding
something better! Put that liquor down.

563
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,486
- He is putting it down, all right!
- Turn that off!

564
00:38:20,012 --> 00:38:22,890
How about a birthday kiss, honey?

565
00:38:27,452 --> 00:38:32,128
Hey, everybody, you know the first time
Big Daddy kissed me, I fainted.

566
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:34,209
It's a fact. Ain't that so, honey?

567
00:38:34,892 --> 00:38:38,805
Do you all know how he proposed to me?
I was four months swole with Gooper...

568
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:42,049
...and Big Daddy said,
"That's my kid, ain't it?"

569
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:44,482
It was kind of funny.
I'd never had a beau...

570
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:47,291
...till I met your father.
He said, "I want that kid.

571
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,720
"I need him.

572
00:38:48,932 --> 00:38:53,130
"He ain't going to have nobody else's name
but mine. Let's get the preacher.

573
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,726
"That's what marriage is for. Family."

574
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:59,531
Children were mighty important
to Big Daddy, even then.

575
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:01,489
Ida, will you stop that yammering?

576
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:04,964
That's just his manner of talking.
He don't mean it.

577
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:07,811
I've been his one and only lover,
haven't I, sweetheart?

578
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:10,083
Ida, will you keep quiet?

579
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:12,604
Children, come on!

580
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:20,084
Here comes Big Daddy's birthday!

581
00:39:23,332 --> 00:39:25,766
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

582
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:28,281
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

583
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,960
"And so is Big Mama, too

584
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:41,442
"Big Daddy's a jolly good fellow

585
00:39:42,532 --> 00:39:45,763
"And so is Big Mama, too"

586
00:39:47,772 --> 00:39:50,923
- Ida, what the hell's the matter with you?
- She's just so happy.

587
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:56,244
I'm so happy.
I've just got to cry or something.

588
00:39:57,132 --> 00:39:59,043
Big Daddy's 100 percent...

589
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:00,321
...healthy!

590
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:04,806
Aren't you going to give Big Daddy
his birthday present?

591
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:16,527
- You can open up your birthday present.
- You open it. I want to talk to Brick.

592
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:18,211
Brick, come over here.

593
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:20,882
Big Daddy's calling you.

594
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:23,686
Big Mama, take them out for me.

595
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:27,521
- It's a cashmere robe!
- You sound surprised.

596
00:40:27,732 --> 00:40:31,884
- I've never seen a cashmere robe before.
- That's funny!

597
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:34,125
What's so funny about it?

598
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,802
All my family ever had was family.

599
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:38,881
Quiet!

600
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:42,209
- You bought it yourself last Saturday.
- I said quiet!

601
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:46,485
The salesgirl that sold it to you
waited on me and she told me about it.

602
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:48,410
- Sister Woman!
- Quiet!

603
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,967
- Stork and the Grim Reaper, neck and neck.
- Deacon!

604
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:52,087
Deacon!

605
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:57,409
I'm not butting in on more talk about
memorial stained-glass windows, am I?

606
00:40:57,892 --> 00:40:59,371
Not at all.

607
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,005
What do you get out
of this charity work, anyway?

608
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:05,883
I love humanity. That's my reward.

609
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:08,925
And if humanity returns your love,
you might get elected...

610
00:41:09,012 --> 00:41:10,968
...councilman or mayor, hey, Deacon?

611
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:12,844
Don't start picking on Deacon.

612
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:15,327
- That's all right. I was...
- Good night, Deacon.

613
00:41:15,412 --> 00:41:19,291
That's exactly what I was about to say.
I better go before it starts raining.

614
00:41:19,492 --> 00:41:22,962
Good night, everybody.
Bless each and every one in this place.

615
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:27,369
They tell me you were indulging in
some athletics last night.

616
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:30,609
- I was trying to, yes, sir.
- At 3:00 in the morning?

617
00:41:31,052 --> 00:41:34,806
What were you doing on the high school
athletic field at 3:00 in the morning?

618
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:39,682
I was running and jumping the hurdles.
They've got too high for me now.

619
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,526
Because you were drunk!

620
00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:44,610
Sober, I would not have tried
to jump even the low ones.

621
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:47,122
It's time to blow out the candles!

622
00:41:47,532 --> 00:41:49,966
A toast to Big Daddy Pollitt...

623
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:52,891
...on his 65th birthday.

624
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:56,926
- To the biggest cotton planter...
- I told you, quit this bull!

625
00:41:57,012 --> 00:41:59,845
I won't let you talk this way,
not even on your birthday.

626
00:41:59,932 --> 00:42:03,288
I'll talk like I want to on my birthday,
or any other rotten day.

627
00:42:03,372 --> 00:42:06,170
Anybody don't like it,
they know what they can do about it.

628
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:09,244
- I know you don't mean that.
- You don't know nothing, never did.

629
00:42:09,332 --> 00:42:12,847
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean it.

630
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:18,045
I've put up with a lot of bull around here
because I thought I was dying.

631
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:20,561
That's when you started taking over.

632
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:24,970
Your loud voice and busybody butting in
here and there and everywhere.

633
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:28,841
Sashaying around here,
making a big noise like a boss.

634
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:31,441
I'm the only boss around here.

635
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:34,730
I built this place with no help from you.

636
00:42:34,892 --> 00:42:37,770
And I'll run this place till the day I die.

637
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,487
Is that plain to you, Ida?
Is that perfectly clear to you?

638
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,841
I ain't going to die.

639
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:46,409
Ain't nothing wrong with me
but a spastic colon!

640
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:49,850
Made spastic, I reckon,
by all the lies and liars...

641
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:52,361
...I've had to put up with around here.

642
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:57,009
And all the hypocrisy I've had to live with
these 40 years I've lived with you.

643
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:00,003
Now blow out them candles.

644
00:43:00,972 --> 00:43:03,930
Go on. Blow out them candles
on that stupid cake.

645
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:13,003
In all these years
you never believed I loved you.

646
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:17,091
And I did.

647
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:20,324
I did so much.

648
00:43:21,452 --> 00:43:22,931
I did love you.

649
00:43:24,332 --> 00:43:28,211
I even loved your hate and your hardness.

650
00:43:34,252 --> 00:43:37,289
- Big Daddy should make plans.
- Lf he should die before...

651
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:39,326
Excuse me.

652
00:43:44,412 --> 00:43:45,640
Son!

653
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:51,371
I was calling Brick.

654
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:54,926
I was just delivering him to you.

655
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:09,171
- What did you do that for?
- Do what?

656
00:44:10,572 --> 00:44:12,005
Wipe off her kiss?

657
00:44:15,332 --> 00:44:16,447
Did I?

658
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:18,768
Your woman's got a better shape on her...

659
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:20,485
...than Gooper's got on his.

660
00:44:21,012 --> 00:44:25,210
- Is that the only difference you've noticed?
- Difference in shape is pretty important.

661
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,085
- But in a way, they're a lot alike.
- How's that?

662
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:31,170
They don't look peaceful. How's that?

663
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:33,408
They're a couple of cats...

664
00:44:33,652 --> 00:44:37,725
...sitting in the middle of 28,000 acres
of land. That's a lot of land.

665
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:42,370
They're both squaring off, determined
to get a bigger piece whenever you let go.

666
00:44:43,252 --> 00:44:45,971
Yeah, well, I've got a surprise
for them babies.

667
00:44:46,172 --> 00:44:49,482
I ain't letting go for a long time yet,
if they're waiting for that.

668
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:53,247
You just sit tight and let them
scratch each other's eyes out.

669
00:44:53,452 --> 00:44:54,805
You bet your life.

670
00:44:55,372 --> 00:44:59,001
Gooper's wife, she's a good breeder.
You'll have to admit she's fertile.

671
00:44:59,212 --> 00:45:01,601
Five head of them already
and more coming.

672
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:06,168
6-0. She'll probably drop a litter next time.

673
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:11,131
- Are you stuck out there?
- I was just passing by.

674
00:45:11,212 --> 00:45:13,043
You were just sneaking and spying.

675
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,881
Do I have to lock all the doors around here
to have a private conversation?

676
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:19,970
- Why hurt those that really love you?
- Bull!

677
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:22,567
I'm going to move you and Gooper
out of that room.

678
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:26,168
It's none of your business what goes on
in here between Brick and Maggie.

679
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:28,932
I hate sneaking and spying!
It makes me puke!

680
00:45:33,852 --> 00:45:35,126
They listen, do they?

681
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:37,124
Yeah, they listen.

682
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:40,005
They run and tell Big Mama
everything they hear.

683
00:45:40,252 --> 00:45:43,801
They say Maggie sleeps on the bed
and you sleep on the sofa. Is that true?

684
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:46,882
If you don't like Maggie, get rid of her!

685
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:49,686
- What are you doing now?
- Freshening up my drink.

686
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:52,406
- You know you've a real liquor problem?
- Yes, sir.

687
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:56,280
- Is that why you quit sports announcing?
- I guess so. Yes, sir, that's it.

688
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:57,368
Don't guess!

689
00:45:57,572 --> 00:45:59,449
It's too important!

690
00:45:59,972 --> 00:46:01,564
So you quit.

691
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:05,085
- Some kind of a disappointment?
- I don't know. Do you?

692
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:07,845
I'm asking you.
How should I know if you don't?

693
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:15,562
Do you think a shot of that whisky
would injure my spastic condition?

694
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:18,960
No, sir.

695
00:46:20,132 --> 00:46:21,963
It might do it some good.

696
00:46:29,132 --> 00:46:31,202
The sky is open again, boy. It's open!

697
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:33,164
That's the way to feel.

698
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:39,970
I can breathe.

699
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:43,965
All my life I've been like a doubled-up fist...

700
00:46:44,172 --> 00:46:46,891
...pounding and smashing and driving!

701
00:46:47,532 --> 00:46:50,205
But now I'm going
to take things easy with them.

702
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,411
Do you know what I'm thinking?

703
00:46:53,492 --> 00:46:54,925
What's that, sir?

704
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,327
Pleasure!

705
00:46:58,492 --> 00:47:01,962
I'll tell you, I still have a feeling for women,
and I'm 65.

706
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:04,527
- That's mighty remarkable.
- Remarkable?

707
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:06,087
Admirable.

708
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:10,490
It's not only remarkable and admirable,
it's downright satisfying.

709
00:47:10,692 --> 00:47:13,604
- I'm going to have me a ball.
- A ball?

710
00:47:13,812 --> 00:47:15,530
I'm going to pick me a choice woman...

711
00:47:15,612 --> 00:47:19,321
...and I'm going to smother her in minks
and choke her with diamonds.

712
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:21,250
I'm going to be happy!

713
00:47:23,492 --> 00:47:26,325
Why are you so restless?
You got ants in your britches?

714
00:47:26,412 --> 00:47:27,891
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

715
00:47:29,532 --> 00:47:32,000
- Something hasn't happened yet.
- What's that?

716
00:47:32,212 --> 00:47:34,601
- A click in my head.
- Did you say, "click"?

717
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:38,486
Yes, sir. That click in my head
that makes me feel peaceful.

718
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,762
Boy, sometimes you worry me.

719
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:46,643
Like a switch clicking off in my head.
Turns the hot light off and the cool one on.

720
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:48,529
All of a sudden, there's peace.

721
00:47:50,932 --> 00:47:53,048
You're a real alcoholic!

722
00:47:54,412 --> 00:47:55,686
That is the truth.

723
00:47:55,892 --> 00:48:00,090
Yes, sir, I am an alcoholic.
So, if you'll just excuse me.

724
00:48:00,412 --> 00:48:02,403
- No, I won't!
- I'm waiting for that click...

725
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:06,246
...and I don't get it unless I'm alone!
I'm not talking. When it's quiet!

726
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:10,769
You'll hear plenty of that in the grave.
Right now we're going to talk.

727
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:14,282
This talk is like all the others.
It gets nowhere and it's painful!

728
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:19,564
- Let it be painful.
- I can crawl and hop if I have to.

729
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:25,566
If you aren't careful, you'll crawl out
this family and be drinking on skid row.

730
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,244
Yeah, that will come too.

731
00:48:27,812 --> 00:48:31,646
No. Now that I'm straightened out,
I'm going to straighten you out.

732
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:33,085
Sit down!

733
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:37,046
It's no use. We talk in circles.
We have nothing to say to each other!

734
00:48:43,972 --> 00:48:46,361
- Where are you going?
- To get another bottle.

735
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:48,881
No, you're not, you drunken whelp!

736
00:48:50,652 --> 00:48:54,406
- Why are you shouting? I can't stand it!
- Get out of here!

737
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:57,126
Leave us alone! Why do you drink?

738
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:01,367
You had better know why you drink
or give it up!

739
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,200
Give me my crutch.

740
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:04,208
Why do you drink?

741
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,328
I stepped on that foot and now I'm in pain.

742
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:07,760
Good!

743
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,605
At least you're not too numb...

744
00:49:15,692 --> 00:49:18,286
...with liquor to feel pain.

745
00:49:20,732 --> 00:49:22,723
- Why do you drink?
- Give me my crutch.

746
00:49:22,932 --> 00:49:26,561
- Tell me first.
- No, give me a drink first.

747
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:31,325
- First you've got to tell me!
- All right! Disgust!

748
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:34,524
- Disgust with what?
- You strike a hard bargain.

749
00:49:34,732 --> 00:49:39,169
- Boy, do you want liquor that bad?
- Yes, sir, I want liquor that bad.

750
00:49:43,092 --> 00:49:45,208
What are you disgusted with?

751
00:49:45,972 --> 00:49:49,123
Mendacity! Do you know what that is?
It's lies and liars!

752
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:51,487
Who's been lying to you? Maggie?

753
00:49:51,692 --> 00:49:53,922
No, not one lie or one person.
The whole thing.

754
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:55,889
- You got a headache?
- No, I'm trying...

755
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:59,801
Trying to concentrate, but you can't
because your brain is soaked with liquor.

756
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:01,081
Wet brain!

757
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:03,407
Mendacity!

758
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:07,366
What do you know about mendacity?
I could write a book on it.

759
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:10,803
- It's your sister calling from Memphis.
- To hell with her!

760
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:12,441
Get out of there!

761
00:50:12,812 --> 00:50:15,451
Go on. Close the door after you.

762
00:50:15,652 --> 00:50:16,482
Mendacity!

763
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:21,568
Look at the lies I've got to put up with.
Pretenses, hypocrisy!

764
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:26,050
Pretending like I care for Big Mama.
I haven't tolerated her in 40 years.

765
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:30,327
Church! It bores me, but I go.

766
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:34,890
All those swindling lodges, social clubs,
and money-grabbing auxiliaries...

767
00:50:35,052 --> 00:50:37,441
...that's got me on their number one
sucker list.

768
00:50:37,612 --> 00:50:41,651
Boy, I've lived with mendacity.
Why can't you live with it?

769
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:46,528
You've got to. There's nothing to live with
but mendacity. Is there?

770
00:50:47,532 --> 00:50:49,602
Yes, sir, you can live with this.

771
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:53,481
That's not living.

772
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:57,924
- That's dodging away from life.
- I want to dodge away from it.

773
00:50:58,012 --> 00:50:59,525
Then why not kill yourself?

774
00:50:59,692 --> 00:51:00,966
Because I like to drink.

775
00:51:01,172 --> 00:51:02,890
I can't talk to you!

776
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:03,842
I'm sorry.

777
00:51:04,052 --> 00:51:07,089
Do you expect me to turn over
28,000 acres of the richest land...

778
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:09,283
...this side of the Nile to a drunk fool?

779
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:10,083
No, sir.

780
00:51:10,252 --> 00:51:14,040
I like you, son, but why should I subsidize
worthless behavior?

781
00:51:14,252 --> 00:51:15,401
Give it to Gooper and Mae.

782
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:19,321
I can't stand Gooper and Mae
and those five screaming monkeys.

783
00:51:20,652 --> 00:51:23,291
I don't have to turn it over to any of you!

784
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:27,610
To this day, I ain't made no will.
Now I don't have to, the pressure's off.

785
00:51:27,812 --> 00:51:30,645
I can wait and see
if you pull yourself together or not.

786
00:51:30,732 --> 00:51:31,528
That's right.

787
00:51:32,052 --> 00:51:35,044
- I'm not kidding.
- No, sir, I know you're not kidding.

788
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:36,887
You don't care?

789
00:51:37,092 --> 00:51:39,048
No, sir, I don't care.

790
00:51:40,252 --> 00:51:41,844
Tell Lacey to drive me to the station.

791
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,809
- Now wait a minute!
- Or I'll drive myself.

792
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:45,889
I'm going home tonight. Now!

793
00:51:46,092 --> 00:51:48,811
- This is your home.
- Is it? Since when?

794
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,843
Let's not leave it like this.

795
00:51:52,092 --> 00:51:54,560
Like all them other talks we've had.

796
00:51:54,772 --> 00:51:58,048
We always seem to talk around things.

797
00:51:58,412 --> 00:52:02,007
Seem to leave things unsaid and unspoken.

798
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:05,682
- Now we've got to talk straight.
- It's too late for talk.

799
00:52:05,892 --> 00:52:06,961
Why?

800
00:52:07,172 --> 00:52:08,969
What are you disgusted about?

801
00:52:09,412 --> 00:52:12,131
Because you can't play football anymore?

802
00:52:12,492 --> 00:52:15,689
Because you lost your job?
I'll get it back for you!

803
00:52:21,452 --> 00:52:24,967
What? Sit in a glass box
watching games that I can't play?

804
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:28,482
Describing what I can't do
while others do it?

805
00:52:29,652 --> 00:52:34,203
Filling my Coke with bourbon so I can
stand it? You'll get that back for me?

806
00:52:34,612 --> 00:52:36,682
I think you're passing the buck.

807
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:40,811
Do you know many drinking men?

808
00:52:40,972 --> 00:52:42,485
I've known a good number.

809
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,762
Could any of them they tell you
why they drank?

810
00:52:44,852 --> 00:52:46,490
You're passing the buck?

811
00:52:46,692 --> 00:52:50,367
You're passing the buck
to things like disgust and mendacity.

812
00:52:50,572 --> 00:52:52,642
If you've got to use that kind of language...

813
00:52:52,812 --> 00:52:55,849
...it's 90 proof bull and I ain't buying any!

814
00:52:56,012 --> 00:53:00,961
You started drinking with your friend
Skipper's death. Ain't that the truth?

815
00:53:09,692 --> 00:53:10,966
What are you suggesting?

816
00:53:12,012 --> 00:53:12,967
Nothing. But...

817
00:53:13,172 --> 00:53:14,400
But what?

818
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:15,561
Say your mind.

819
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:16,967
Say it!

820
00:53:17,772 --> 00:53:19,888
- Why are you so excited?
- Go ahead, say it!

821
00:53:20,092 --> 00:53:21,491
Why are you shouting like that?

822
00:53:21,572 --> 00:53:23,528
Skipper and I were friends, understand?

823
00:53:23,692 --> 00:53:25,125
Gooper said that Skipper was...

824
00:53:25,212 --> 00:53:28,045
Skipper is the only thing
that I've got left to believe in!

825
00:53:28,132 --> 00:53:29,724
And you drag it through the gutter!

826
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:32,326
- Just a minute!
- You make it shameful and filthy!

827
00:53:41,892 --> 00:53:43,120
Give me your hand.

828
00:53:45,732 --> 00:53:49,008
I don't want your hand.
To hell with all lies and liars!

829
00:53:49,612 --> 00:53:52,172
Didn't you ever look up to anybody?

830
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:54,050
Anybody at all in your whole life?

831
00:53:54,252 --> 00:53:56,971
Didn't you ever believe in anything,
anybody?

832
00:53:58,252 --> 00:54:01,005
No, sir, I guess you didn't.

833
00:54:01,332 --> 00:54:04,449
Nothing and nobody
except Big Daddy himself.

834
00:54:04,652 --> 00:54:06,643
You and Skipper played football together.

835
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:09,292
Made a few touchdowns.
Does that make him God Almighty?

836
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:10,720
I could depend on him.

837
00:54:10,852 --> 00:54:13,764
- On the football field!
- Anytime, anywhere, anyplace!

838
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:15,485
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

839
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:17,045
Bull!

840
00:54:17,372 --> 00:54:20,569
Why did your big strong man fall apart?

841
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,724
Why did Skipper crack up?

842
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:25,520
All right.

843
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:29,212
You're asking for it,
we're going to have that talk.

844
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:32,561
That straight, true talk.

845
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,245
It's too late to stop now.

846
00:54:34,452 --> 00:54:35,885
Can you say it without a drink?

847
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,532
I haven't heard that mechanical click yet.

848
00:54:38,732 --> 00:54:42,725
You need a lot of crutches, don't you?
Clicks. Whisky.

849
00:54:42,932 --> 00:54:44,729
What else do you need?

850
00:54:44,932 --> 00:54:45,489
Skipper?

851
00:54:46,572 --> 00:54:49,450
- He was a crutch for you too, wasn't he?
- Yes, sir.

852
00:54:49,612 --> 00:54:52,126
I could lean on him, in school and out of it.

853
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:56,487
How did Maggie take
this great and true friendship?

854
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,042
Ask her.

855
00:55:00,252 --> 00:55:01,162
I'm asking you.

856
00:55:01,372 --> 00:55:04,728
If you want to know why Skipper
cracked up, ask Maggie the cat.

857
00:55:04,932 --> 00:55:05,682
What did she do?

858
00:55:06,452 --> 00:55:09,603
Chase him out of the window
of that Chicago hotel?

859
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:13,242
Did that little bitty girl shove
your big hero out all by herself?

860
00:55:13,892 --> 00:55:14,927
Why?

861
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,082
What went on
between Skipper and Maggie?

862
00:55:19,492 --> 00:55:20,368
Ask her.

863
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:26,606
Maggie, come here.

864
00:55:26,692 --> 00:55:29,490
Can I be of assistance, Big Daddy?

865
00:55:32,932 --> 00:55:35,366
Trixie's ready to play the piano for you!

866
00:55:35,572 --> 00:55:37,722
Go ahead, play.

867
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:48,324
What was going on
between you and Skipper?

868
00:55:50,252 --> 00:55:52,163
Well, you see, Big Daddy...

869
00:55:54,092 --> 00:55:55,241
Well?

870
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:58,249
Come on, Maggie!

871
00:55:58,452 --> 00:56:00,488
You wanted to talk truth upstairs.

872
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:02,085
Go ahead!

873
00:56:02,252 --> 00:56:04,812
Big Daddy wants to know. Tell him!

874
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:11,604
Skipper didn't like me.

875
00:56:11,812 --> 00:56:13,768
Why didn't Skipper like you?

876
00:56:13,972 --> 00:56:16,532
- You know he was against our marriage.
- Why?

877
00:56:16,732 --> 00:56:20,327
- Because it meant less freedom for you.
- Freedom to do what?

878
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:22,926
Freedom to run from town to town.

879
00:56:23,132 --> 00:56:25,282
Planes, trains, always running!

880
00:56:25,452 --> 00:56:29,570
- Football practice, dirty stories...
- Nobody forced you to come along with us!

881
00:56:29,772 --> 00:56:33,685
I didn't expect to spend my honeymoon
in the locker room with the boys.

882
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:37,168
Since when did a man's smell
ever injure your sensitive feelings?

883
00:56:37,372 --> 00:56:38,805
Football, baby!

884
00:56:39,012 --> 00:56:41,287
The idea of football smelled.

885
00:56:41,452 --> 00:56:44,285
Especially the notions
of a professional team.

886
00:56:44,492 --> 00:56:46,642
He didn't need any team of his own.

887
00:56:46,852 --> 00:56:50,208
He could've gotten a spot
on any pro team in the country.

888
00:56:51,212 --> 00:56:53,601
You organized your own team
on account of Skipper.

889
00:56:53,812 --> 00:56:57,168
- You're a liar!
- He wasn't good enough on his own.

890
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,602
Professional football is a business...

891
00:56:59,812 --> 00:57:00,801
...not a social club!

892
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:03,448
You mean the business of making money?

893
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:06,120
Yeah, money!
The stuff your dreams are made of!

894
00:57:06,612 --> 00:57:09,285
The Dixie Stars never made a nickel!

895
00:57:09,452 --> 00:57:11,761
Not from the first day to the last.

896
00:57:11,972 --> 00:57:14,008
It wasn't the money, it was the cheers.

897
00:57:14,212 --> 00:57:15,611
He lapped them up.

898
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:19,282
The cheers didn't mean anything to me.
But they did to you!

899
00:57:19,492 --> 00:57:22,211
Because they shut you out
and you hated that.

900
00:57:22,412 --> 00:57:24,607
Not by the crowds, baby, by you.

901
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:26,530
By the man I worshiped.

902
00:57:26,732 --> 00:57:29,007
That's why I hated Skipper.

903
00:57:29,732 --> 00:57:33,247
You hated him so much you got him drunk
and went to bed with him.

904
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:45,444
Is that true?

905
00:57:52,852 --> 00:57:56,561
You don't think I ravished a football hero?

906
00:57:59,692 --> 00:58:01,284
Skipper was drunk.

907
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:03,643
So are you most of the time.

908
00:58:03,852 --> 00:58:06,491
I don't seem to make out so well with you.

909
00:58:10,492 --> 00:58:13,564
Are you saying nothing happened
between you and Skipper?

910
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:16,240
- You know what happened.
- I don't know!

911
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,204
I wasn't there.

912
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,165
I couldn't play that Sunday.
I wasn't in Chicago.

913
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,328
- I was in the hospital...
- Skipper played.

914
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:24,765
He played all right!

915
00:58:24,972 --> 00:58:27,088
His first professional game without Brick.

916
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:31,122
Tell Big Daddy what happened.

917
00:58:31,332 --> 00:58:32,765
Go on, tell him.

918
00:58:32,972 --> 00:58:34,803
You're a sports announcer.

919
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:39,164
Give us a running account
of the all-American bust.

920
00:58:39,372 --> 00:58:42,170
Tell him how many times
Skipper fumbled...

921
00:58:42,372 --> 00:58:44,806
...and stumbled and fell apart.

922
00:58:45,132 --> 00:58:49,011
On offensive he was useless.
On defensive he was a coward.

923
00:58:49,212 --> 00:58:50,565
And it was all over:

924
00:58:50,732 --> 00:58:53,644
Chicago: 47, Dixie Stars: 0.

925
00:58:53,852 --> 00:58:55,410
Bad breaks. An off day.

926
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:56,567
No, baby.

927
00:58:56,972 --> 00:58:59,691
Without you, Skipper was nothing.

928
00:58:59,852 --> 00:59:01,922
Outside: Big, tough, confident.

929
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:03,923
Inside: Pure jelly!

930
00:59:04,972 --> 00:59:07,327
You saw the game on TV.
You saw what happened.

931
00:59:07,532 --> 00:59:10,126
But I didn't see what happened
in Skipper's hotel room.

932
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:12,043
That little episode was not on TV.

933
00:59:12,252 --> 00:59:15,324
Tell Big Daddy
why you were in Skipper's room.

934
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:16,851
He was sick.

935
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:18,651
Sick with drink.

936
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:20,080
He wouldn't come out.

937
00:59:20,172 --> 00:59:21,491
He'd busted some furniture...

938
00:59:21,572 --> 00:59:25,201
...and the hotel manager said to stop him
before he called the police.

939
00:59:25,452 --> 00:59:27,647
So I went to his room.

940
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:30,526
I scratched on his door
and begged him to let me in.

941
00:59:30,732 --> 00:59:32,051
He was half crazy.

942
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:33,844
Violent and screaming one minute...

943
00:59:34,052 --> 00:59:36,247
...weak and crying the next.

944
00:59:36,452 --> 00:59:39,808
And all the time, scared stiff about you.

945
00:59:40,652 --> 00:59:44,327
So I said to him maybe it was time
we forgot about football.

946
00:59:44,812 --> 00:59:48,122
Maybe he ought to get a job
and let me and Brick alone.

947
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,641
I thought he'd hit me.

948
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:54,523
He walked toward me...

949
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:58,641
...with a funny sort of smile on his face.

950
01:00:00,092 --> 01:00:02,481
Then he did the strangest thing.

951
01:00:02,852 --> 01:00:04,570
He kissed me.

952
01:00:05,212 --> 01:00:07,680
That was the first time
he'd ever touched me.

953
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,163
And then I knew what I was going to do.

954
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:12,249
I'd get rid of Skipper.

955
01:00:12,452 --> 01:00:16,047
I'd show Brick that their deep,
true friendship was a big lie.

956
01:00:16,732 --> 01:00:18,085
I'd prove it by showing...

957
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:21,728
...that Skipper would make love
to his best friend's wife.

958
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:23,970
He didn't need any coaxing.

959
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:26,049
He was more than willing.

960
01:00:26,252 --> 01:00:28,482
He even seemed to have the same idea.

961
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,289
You're just trying to whitewash it.

962
01:00:31,812 --> 01:00:32,642
I'm not!

963
01:00:32,852 --> 01:00:34,570
I was trying to win back my husband.

964
01:00:34,692 --> 01:00:37,650
It didn't matter how.
I would've done anything.

965
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:39,763
Even that.

966
01:00:40,812 --> 01:00:42,404
But at the last second...

967
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,244
...I got panicky.

968
01:00:45,332 --> 01:00:47,846
Supposing I lost you instead?

969
01:00:48,652 --> 01:00:51,564
Supposing you'd hate me
instead of Skipper?

970
01:00:52,492 --> 01:00:54,244
So I ran.

971
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:56,286
Nothing happened!

972
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:59,290
I've tried to tell him a hundred times
but he won't let me.

973
01:00:59,892 --> 01:01:01,120
Nothing happened!

974
01:01:01,332 --> 01:01:03,448
Hallelujah, St. Maggie.

975
01:01:05,172 --> 01:01:07,527
I wanted to get rid of Skipper.

976
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:10,044
But not if it meant losing you.

977
01:01:10,252 --> 01:01:12,482
He blames me for Skipper's death.

978
01:01:13,372 --> 01:01:16,205
Maybe I got rid of Skipper.

979
01:01:18,772 --> 01:01:21,206
Skipper won out anyway.

980
01:01:23,452 --> 01:01:25,886
I didn't get rid of him at all.

981
01:01:33,372 --> 01:01:35,840
Isn't it an awful joke, honey?

982
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:38,728
I lost you anyway.

983
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:43,806
- You didn't talk to him again before he...
- No.

984
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:46,728
- But Brick did.
- How do you know?

985
01:01:46,892 --> 01:01:48,644
- Skipper told me.
- When?

986
01:01:48,852 --> 01:01:51,366
When they put his broken body
in the ambulance.

987
01:01:51,572 --> 01:01:53,483
I rode with him to the hospital.

988
01:01:53,732 --> 01:01:57,725
He kept saying,
"Why did Brick hang up on me?"

989
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:00,804
Why, Brick?

990
01:02:15,772 --> 01:02:17,808
- Where are you going?
- Home.

991
01:02:20,652 --> 01:02:23,291
- You can't drive. You're drunk.
- Not yet, Big Daddy.

992
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,203
Not yet. Now, give me that bottle.

993
01:02:29,132 --> 01:02:30,850
What are you running away from?

994
01:02:35,172 --> 01:02:38,244
Why did you hang up on Skipper
when he called you?

995
01:02:41,652 --> 01:02:42,880
Answer me!

996
01:02:43,772 --> 01:02:46,491
What did he say?
Was it about him and Maggie?

997
01:02:46,692 --> 01:02:48,887
- He said they'd made love.
- And you believed him?

998
01:02:49,092 --> 01:02:50,127
Yes.

999
01:02:50,972 --> 01:02:52,724
Then why haven't you thrown her out?

1000
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:55,925
Something's missing here.
Why did Skipper kill himself?

1001
01:02:56,652 --> 01:02:58,244
Because somebody let him down.

1002
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:06,890
I let him down.

1003
01:03:08,892 --> 01:03:10,803
When he called that night...

1004
01:03:13,732 --> 01:03:15,927
...I couldn't make sense out of...

1005
01:03:16,532 --> 01:03:19,046
But there was one thing that was sure.

1006
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,447
Skipper was scared.

1007
01:03:23,932 --> 01:03:25,570
Scared...

1008
01:03:26,892 --> 01:03:29,565
...about what happened that day
on the football field.

1009
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:30,568
That I'd blame him.

1010
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:33,844
Scared that I'd walk out on him.

1011
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:38,529
Skipper afraid! I couldn't believe that.

1012
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:42,042
I mean, inside he was real
deep-down scared...

1013
01:03:42,732 --> 01:03:45,371
...and he broke like a rotten stick.

1014
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,722
He started crying:

1015
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,523
"I need you."

1016
01:03:51,732 --> 01:03:54,087
He kept babbling, "Help me."

1017
01:03:55,452 --> 01:03:57,283
Me help him?

1018
01:03:58,892 --> 01:04:00,962
How does one drowning man...

1019
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:02,730
...help another drowning man?

1020
01:04:03,212 --> 01:04:05,043
So you hung up on him.

1021
01:04:06,732 --> 01:04:08,688
And then that phone...

1022
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:11,203
...started to ring again.

1023
01:04:12,772 --> 01:04:16,321
It rang and it rang
and it wouldn't stop ringing.

1024
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:21,567
And I lay in that hospital bed,
unable to move or run from that sound.

1025
01:04:21,812 --> 01:04:24,246
It kept ringing louder and louder.

1026
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:28,167
And the sound of that
was like Skipper screaming for help.

1027
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:34,562
And I couldn't pick it up.

1028
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,640
So that's when he killed himself?

1029
01:04:42,972 --> 01:04:44,041
Yes.

1030
01:04:45,772 --> 01:04:47,808
Because I let him down.

1031
01:04:52,332 --> 01:04:56,644
So that disgust with mendacity
is really disgust with myself.

1032
01:04:56,852 --> 01:05:01,004
When I hear that click I don't hear
the sound of that phone ringing anymore.

1033
01:05:01,212 --> 01:05:03,203
And I can stop thinking.

1034
01:05:03,412 --> 01:05:04,970
I'm ashamed!

1035
01:05:05,172 --> 01:05:08,403
That's why I'm a drunk.
When I'm drunk I can stand myself.

1036
01:05:08,852 --> 01:05:11,491
But the truth is always there
in the morning, isn't it?

1037
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:14,164
And it's here right now.

1038
01:05:15,532 --> 01:05:19,161
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.
That's all it is. Self-pity!

1039
01:05:19,372 --> 01:05:21,602
You didn't kill Skipper. He killed himself.

1040
01:05:21,772 --> 01:05:24,764
You, Skipper and lots like you,
living in a kid's world...

1041
01:05:24,972 --> 01:05:28,681
...playing games, touchdowns,
no worries, no responsibilities.

1042
01:05:28,972 --> 01:05:30,928
Life ain't no damn football game.

1043
01:05:31,132 --> 01:05:33,123
Life ain't just a bunch of high spots.

1044
01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:37,768
You're a 30-year-old kid.
Soon you'll be a 50-year-old kid...

1045
01:05:38,212 --> 01:05:40,601
...pretending you hear cheers
when there ain't any.

1046
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:42,887
Dreaming and drinking your life away.

1047
01:05:43,092 --> 01:05:44,411
Heroes in the real world...

1048
01:05:44,612 --> 01:05:47,968
...live 24 hours a day,
not just two hours in a game.

1049
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:51,809
Mendacity! You won't...

1050
01:05:54,172 --> 01:05:57,608
You won't live with mendacity,
but you're an expert at it.

1051
01:05:57,772 --> 01:05:59,808
The truth is pain and sweat...

1052
01:06:00,012 --> 01:06:04,085
...paying bills and making love to a woman
that you don't love anymore.

1053
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:06,283
The truth is dreams that don't come true...

1054
01:06:06,412 --> 01:06:09,290
...and nobody prints your name
in the paper till you die.

1055
01:06:15,052 --> 01:06:16,485
Now, here.

1056
01:06:20,412 --> 01:06:22,323
The truth is you never growed up.

1057
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:24,602
- Grown-ups don't hang up on friends.
- Get away.

1058
01:06:24,692 --> 01:06:27,843
And they don't hang up on their wives.
They don't hang up on life.

1059
01:06:28,012 --> 01:06:30,572
Now that's the truth that you can't face.

1060
01:06:30,772 --> 01:06:32,285
- Can you face the truth?
- Try me.

1061
01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:33,930
Sure, somebody else's truth!

1062
01:06:34,012 --> 01:06:35,764
- You're running again.
- Yeah, I am.

1063
01:06:35,852 --> 01:06:38,366
Running from lies,
like birthday congratulations...

1064
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:41,888
...and many happy returns of the day
when there won't be any, and...

1065
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,889
Please, let me go home.

1066
01:06:56,172 --> 01:06:57,890
- What did you say?
- I don't remember.

1067
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,089
- There won't be any happy returns?
- Forget it.

1068
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:03,726
Let me go home.
Leave the place to Gooper and Mae.

1069
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:07,043
Who said I was going to leave
the place or anything?

1070
01:07:07,252 --> 01:07:08,731
I'll outlive you.

1071
01:07:08,932 --> 01:07:09,967
I'll bury you.

1072
01:07:10,172 --> 01:07:12,128
- I'll buy your coffin.
- That's right.

1073
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:14,243
Many happy returns.

1074
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:21,570
They were lying...

1075
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:23,091
...weren't they, son...

1076
01:07:23,452 --> 01:07:25,602
...about that report from the clinic?

1077
01:07:27,492 --> 01:07:28,971
This pain...

1078
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:30,804
...that keeps grabbing at me...

1079
01:07:31,932 --> 01:07:33,285
It's death...

1080
01:07:34,412 --> 01:07:35,527
...ain't it?

1081
01:07:36,492 --> 01:07:37,925
Answer me!

1082
01:07:38,212 --> 01:07:39,645
The truth!

1083
01:07:40,732 --> 01:07:45,487
You said it yourself.
Mendacity is a system we live in.

1084
01:08:20,332 --> 01:08:21,242
Brick, wait!

1085
01:08:43,212 --> 01:08:45,362
Look at us, Maggie.

1086
01:08:45,572 --> 01:08:47,961
The great Pollitt Enterprises...

1087
01:08:48,572 --> 01:08:50,449
...stuck in the...

1088
01:08:51,572 --> 01:08:53,244
I hurt him, Maggie.

1089
01:08:56,812 --> 01:08:59,610
I hurt him really bad.

1090
01:08:59,812 --> 01:09:01,450
What's the matter? What's happened?

1091
01:09:01,652 --> 01:09:04,450
- Why is Big Daddy...
- We've got to talk to you.

1092
01:09:04,812 --> 01:09:06,370
- Get Dr. Baugh!
- Where is he?

1093
01:09:06,572 --> 01:09:08,608
I don't know, just find him.

1094
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:18,528
Doc!

1095
01:09:20,172 --> 01:09:22,732
I wouldn't go down to him right now.

1096
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:24,007
Sweetheart!

1097
01:09:25,292 --> 01:09:27,408
Big Daddy, can you hear me?

1098
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:30,251
What are you doing?

1099
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:32,130
I'm coming down.

1100
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,965
No need to, Ida.
We'll be coming up in a minute.

1101
01:09:48,212 --> 01:09:50,043
If that pain gets too bad...

1102
01:09:51,052 --> 01:09:52,804
...this is morphine...

1103
01:09:53,132 --> 01:09:54,884
...and a syringe.

1104
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:58,046
The instructions are written out.

1105
01:09:59,852 --> 01:10:02,127
It's no use pretending anymore.

1106
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,846
When that pain hits, it'll hit hard.

1107
01:10:05,892 --> 01:10:07,962
Make it easy on yourself.

1108
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,651
Here.

1109
01:10:12,172 --> 01:10:14,891
You'd better take off those wet clothes.

1110
01:10:15,692 --> 01:10:16,568
Why?

1111
01:10:16,772 --> 01:10:19,002
You afraid I might catch cold and die?

1112
01:10:35,132 --> 01:10:36,451
Why can't I go down to him?

1113
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,011
Well, he's...

1114
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:42,806
His stomach's upset, Ida.

1115
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:46,449
All he needs is a peppermint.

1116
01:10:48,052 --> 01:10:49,770
It's time we had that talk, Doc.

1117
01:10:49,932 --> 01:10:52,730
- It'll be painful.
- Painful things can't always be avoided.

1118
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:55,002
So I've noticed. But there are times...

1119
01:10:55,212 --> 01:10:57,089
It's time we all had our talk.

1120
01:10:57,292 --> 01:10:59,487
What talk are you talking about?

1121
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:03,329
- What were they fighting about?
- We didn't discuss it.

1122
01:11:03,412 --> 01:11:05,448
What's he doing in the cellar all alone?

1123
01:11:05,612 --> 01:11:07,011
Why can't Big Mama see him?

1124
01:11:07,212 --> 01:11:08,327
You heard why.

1125
01:11:08,532 --> 01:11:11,683
He's got the stomach upset.
It's made him irritable.

1126
01:11:11,972 --> 01:11:15,442
When couples have been together
as long as me and Big Daddy...

1127
01:11:15,652 --> 01:11:19,247
...they get irritable with each other
from too much devotion.

1128
01:11:20,372 --> 01:11:21,930
Isn't that so?

1129
01:11:23,172 --> 01:11:25,128
Of course that's so.

1130
01:11:25,932 --> 01:11:27,604
He loves his family.

1131
01:11:27,852 --> 01:11:30,366
He loves them around,
but it strains his nerves.

1132
01:11:30,572 --> 01:11:33,211
He wasn't himself.
I could tell he was all worked-up.

1133
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:35,852
It's the party and the excitement.

1134
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:38,520
He's probably just a little worn out,
that's all.

1135
01:11:38,732 --> 01:11:40,051
Did you notice how he ate?

1136
01:11:40,132 --> 01:11:42,327
He ate like a P-I-G hog.

1137
01:11:42,892 --> 01:11:44,803
I hope he doesn't regret it.

1138
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:46,241
Who?

1139
01:11:46,532 --> 01:11:48,011
Big Daddy?

1140
01:11:48,612 --> 01:11:50,568
He helped himself twice to hopping John.

1141
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:54,362
He just loves hopping John.
We had a real country dinner.

1142
01:11:54,572 --> 01:11:56,005
And candied yams.

1143
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:59,404
That man put away
enough to stuff a field hand.

1144
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:02,162
I hope he doesn't have
to pay for it later on.

1145
01:12:02,372 --> 01:12:03,487
What's that?

1146
01:12:03,692 --> 01:12:04,920
Gooper say he hopes...

1147
01:12:05,132 --> 01:12:07,327
Shoot! Gooper says!

1148
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:10,092
There ain't nothing wrong
with Big Daddy but nerves.

1149
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:13,208
Ain't that so?

1150
01:12:16,492 --> 01:12:18,960
He's as sound as a dollar.
And now he knows he is.

1151
01:12:19,172 --> 01:12:23,290
That's why he ate such a supper.
He had a load off his mind, knowing he...

1152
01:12:23,492 --> 01:12:26,052
...he wasn't doomed to...

1153
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:29,047
...what he thought he was doomed to.

1154
01:12:31,492 --> 01:12:33,448
Nothing's going to hurt Big Daddy.

1155
01:12:33,612 --> 01:12:35,762
We won't allow anything to happen to him.

1156
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:38,362
Doc, come here!

1157
01:12:38,452 --> 01:12:39,805
I don't need any doctor.

1158
01:12:39,892 --> 01:12:41,689
He's something to say about Big Daddy.

1159
01:12:41,772 --> 01:12:43,251
I want Brick.

1160
01:12:44,052 --> 01:12:45,883
He'll be down directly.

1161
01:12:46,092 --> 01:12:48,367
Sticky rain always makes me sick.

1162
01:12:49,372 --> 01:12:51,932
Give me something
to wash this tablet down with.

1163
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:55,130
What's wrong?
You've all got such long faces.

1164
01:12:57,932 --> 01:12:59,126
Big Mama needs you.

1165
01:12:59,332 --> 01:13:00,890
They'll tell her without me.

1166
01:13:01,012 --> 01:13:02,491
Please, Brick.

1167
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:05,286
I just can't stand the way
that Mae and Gooper are...

1168
01:13:05,452 --> 01:13:07,886
What? Trying to grab this place
for themselves?

1169
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,128
Let them have it all.

1170
01:13:10,332 --> 01:13:12,641
If you want to fight for a piece
of his carcass...

1171
01:13:12,732 --> 01:13:14,962
...you go ahead,
but you'll do it without me.

1172
01:13:15,052 --> 01:13:19,170
I deserved that. But not this time.
This time you're wrong.

1173
01:13:19,372 --> 01:13:20,725
What I can't stand is...

1174
01:13:20,812 --> 01:13:23,849
It's not losing this place, it's Big Mama.

1175
01:13:24,772 --> 01:13:27,491
I know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

1176
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:30,286
Careful, your claws are showing.

1177
01:13:33,452 --> 01:13:34,726
Close that door.

1178
01:13:34,932 --> 01:13:36,524
Don't close that door.

1179
01:13:37,452 --> 01:13:39,044
Let a little air circulate.

1180
01:13:39,732 --> 01:13:42,644
We shouldn't risk Big Daddy
hearing this discussion.

1181
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:45,008
What discussion of what?

1182
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,650
- Maggie, Brick!
- Now, now, Big Mama...

1183
01:13:46,732 --> 01:13:49,371
There won't be a word said
in Big Daddy's house...

1184
01:13:49,572 --> 01:13:52,530
...that he can't hear if he wants to.
Brick, where are you?

1185
01:13:52,612 --> 01:13:54,887
Where do you think?
Gone to pieces, that's where!

1186
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:57,328
Doc, ain't there a cure for drinkers?

1187
01:13:57,532 --> 01:13:59,488
- He don't need no cure.
- Of course not.

1188
01:13:59,692 --> 01:14:01,922
He'll just drink all the whisky in the state.

1189
01:14:02,132 --> 01:14:03,565
Stop that kind of talk!

1190
01:14:04,492 --> 01:14:08,041
Big Daddy takes a drink now and then.
I don't trust a man who don't drink.

1191
01:14:08,252 --> 01:14:09,685
Good for you!

1192
01:14:10,332 --> 01:14:12,926
Sit down and hold Big Mama's hand
while we talk.

1193
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,323
What are you all surrounding me for?

1194
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:18,329
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

1195
01:14:18,532 --> 01:14:19,442
Are you all crazy?

1196
01:14:19,532 --> 01:14:22,763
- You calm yourself, sweetheart.
- You calm yourself, Sister Woman!

1197
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:24,246
How can I calm myself...

1198
01:14:24,332 --> 01:14:27,210
...with everyone staring at me
as if blood was on my face?

1199
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:30,963
What's all this about?

1200
01:14:32,052 --> 01:14:33,167
Sit down, Mae.

1201
01:14:33,372 --> 01:14:36,125
Big Mama wants to know the truth
about the clinic report.

1202
01:14:36,332 --> 01:14:37,651
Truth!

1203
01:14:38,532 --> 01:14:41,092
Everybody keeps hollering about the truth.

1204
01:14:41,292 --> 01:14:42,691
The truth is as dirty...

1205
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:43,961
...as lies!

1206
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:54,323
Is there something I don't know, Doc?

1207
01:14:54,412 --> 01:14:55,367
Well, Ida...

1208
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:56,971
I want to know!

1209
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:03,250
- Somebody must be lying.
- Sit down, Mama, please.

1210
01:15:03,892 --> 01:15:05,610
I want to know about my husband.

1211
01:15:05,852 --> 01:15:09,367
He had the most thorough examination
at the Oppenheim Clinic.

1212
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:11,528
One of the best clinics in the country.

1213
01:15:11,612 --> 01:15:14,080
The best in the country, bar none.

1214
01:15:14,252 --> 01:15:16,812
They were 99.9 percent sure
before they even started.

1215
01:15:17,052 --> 01:15:18,246
Right, Doc?

1216
01:15:18,572 --> 01:15:19,561
Sure of what?

1217
01:15:19,692 --> 01:15:21,091
- Not now!
- The test was positive!

1218
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:22,725
Shut up.

1219
01:15:28,332 --> 01:15:31,404
It's hopeless. He knows it, too.

1220
01:15:32,372 --> 01:15:33,361
Hopeless?

1221
01:15:33,572 --> 01:15:36,132
- Now, now, darling.
- You had to know.

1222
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:40,011
Why didn't they cut it out of him?

1223
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:44,125
- It's gone past the knife.
- He's dying, Big Mama.

1224
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:46,607
You get away from me, Mae!

1225
01:15:46,812 --> 01:15:47,608
I want Brick.

1226
01:15:47,692 --> 01:15:49,683
Where's my Brick? Where's my only son?

1227
01:15:53,572 --> 01:15:55,369
Mama, please.

1228
01:15:56,772 --> 01:15:58,842
- I'm your son, too.
- Gooper's your firstborn.

1229
01:15:58,932 --> 01:16:00,763
- Now, listen to me!
- No!

1230
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:03,049
- He'll be in pain.
- Gooper and I think...

1231
01:16:03,252 --> 01:16:04,605
Shut up!

1232
01:16:04,812 --> 01:16:06,450
Do you want to see him suffer?

1233
01:16:06,572 --> 01:16:08,961
Then he's got to be started on morphine.

1234
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:11,692
Nobody's going to give
my husband morphine.

1235
01:16:18,772 --> 01:16:21,286
Why don't you give her a while
to adjust to the idea?

1236
01:16:21,372 --> 01:16:23,124
It's Maggie who's upsetting her.

1237
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:27,205
Instead of the needle, haven't you got a pill
to make the pain disappear?

1238
01:16:27,372 --> 01:16:30,808
Sometimes I wish I had a pill
to make people disappear.

1239
01:16:31,012 --> 01:16:33,526
Thanks for everything, Doc.
We sure do appreciate...

1240
01:16:50,092 --> 01:16:50,888
Does Brick know?

1241
01:17:04,492 --> 01:17:06,323
You know, honey...

1242
01:17:08,212 --> 01:17:10,521
...we was never a very happy family.

1243
01:17:12,972 --> 01:17:15,247
There wasn't much joy in this house.

1244
01:17:15,452 --> 01:17:18,569
It wasn't Big Daddy's fault. It was just...

1245
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:22,442
You know how some homes are happy.

1246
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:28,009
I thought, coming home from the clinic
today, "Now we'll be happy here."

1247
01:17:28,612 --> 01:17:31,763
You and Brick will live with us
and have your children here.

1248
01:17:31,972 --> 01:17:34,088
And we'll help each other be happy.

1249
01:17:39,172 --> 01:17:41,083
Nothing's ever the way you plan, is it?

1250
01:17:47,732 --> 01:17:49,006
Margaret, honey...

1251
01:17:49,212 --> 01:17:50,486
...you've got to help Brick.

1252
01:17:50,572 --> 01:17:52,164
Make him pull himself together.

1253
01:17:52,372 --> 01:17:54,966
- He's going to take hold of things.
- What things?

1254
01:17:57,532 --> 01:17:58,408
The place.

1255
01:17:58,892 --> 01:18:00,530
Big Mama, you've had a shock.

1256
01:18:00,732 --> 01:18:01,960
We've all had a shock.

1257
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:04,885
- Let's be realistic.
- Big Daddy wouldn't be foolish enough...

1258
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:08,089
He'd never put this place
in irresponsible hands!

1259
01:18:08,172 --> 01:18:10,481
He ain't putting this place
in anybody's hands.

1260
01:18:10,892 --> 01:18:13,167
My husband is not going to die!

1261
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:15,681
I want you to get that in your heads.
Both of you.

1262
01:18:15,772 --> 01:18:18,127
- We're hoping too.
- We intend to pray for him.

1263
01:18:18,332 --> 01:18:20,323
I won't let you persuade Big Daddy to...

1264
01:18:20,412 --> 01:18:22,323
Gooper is your firstborn!

1265
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:26,081
He's always had to carry a bigger load
of the responsibilities than Brick.

1266
01:18:26,572 --> 01:18:30,201
Brick never carried a thing in his life
but a football or a highball.

1267
01:18:30,412 --> 01:18:31,731
Will you let me talk, please?

1268
01:18:31,812 --> 01:18:33,211
Yes, of course.

1269
01:18:34,652 --> 01:18:37,405
A 28,000 acre plantation
is a mighty big thing to run.

1270
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:38,965
Almost single-handed.

1271
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:42,562
You had your law practice in Memphis.
When did you run this place?

1272
01:18:42,732 --> 01:18:45,166
Mama, let's be fair.

1273
01:18:45,852 --> 01:18:48,082
Ever since Big Daddy's health
started failing...

1274
01:18:48,172 --> 01:18:50,732
...Gooper's worked like a fool
to keep this place up.

1275
01:18:50,932 --> 01:18:54,368
Gooper won't admit it.
He never thought of it as a duty.

1276
01:18:54,852 --> 01:18:56,570
Big Daddy don't know what he owns.

1277
01:18:56,772 --> 01:19:00,685
The point is I won't see this place ruined
by a drunken ex-football hero.

1278
01:19:00,892 --> 01:19:02,644
Shut up about my husband!

1279
01:19:02,852 --> 01:19:03,648
You shut up!

1280
01:19:03,732 --> 01:19:05,609
He has no right to slander...

1281
01:19:05,812 --> 01:19:08,372
I can discuss my brother
with my family members...

1282
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:11,007
...which don't include you!

1283
01:19:12,692 --> 01:19:14,330
Why not go up and drink with Brick?

1284
01:19:14,412 --> 01:19:16,846
If the hero hadn't passed out already.

1285
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:19,441
He may have to pass up
the Sugar Bowl this year.

1286
01:19:19,852 --> 01:19:21,968
Or was it the Rose Bowl
he made his run in?

1287
01:19:22,052 --> 01:19:23,644
It was the punch bowl, honey.

1288
01:19:23,732 --> 01:19:25,688
The cut-glass punch bowl.

1289
01:19:26,212 --> 01:19:28,203
I always get that boy's bowls mixed up.

1290
01:19:28,812 --> 01:19:32,248
I have never seen such malice
toward a brother.

1291
01:19:32,452 --> 01:19:34,568
What about his malice toward Gooper?

1292
01:19:34,772 --> 01:19:37,445
He can't even stand being
in the same room with me.

1293
01:19:39,452 --> 01:19:40,965
Can I help you, Mr. Brick?

1294
01:19:41,132 --> 01:19:42,451
No, thank you, Lacey.

1295
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:45,212
- Where's my father?
- He's in the cellar.

1296
01:19:45,412 --> 01:19:47,209
And he's alone.

1297
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:48,687
And he's...

1298
01:19:49,372 --> 01:19:50,930
Thank you, Lacey.

1299
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:54,484
- It's a deliberate campaign to ruin Brick.
- He don't need help.

1300
01:19:54,572 --> 01:19:57,325
For the most disgusting,
sordid reasons on earth.

1301
01:19:57,532 --> 01:19:58,442
Avarice.

1302
01:19:58,652 --> 01:20:01,041
Avarice and greed!

1303
01:20:01,252 --> 01:20:02,128
No, Margaret.

1304
01:20:02,332 --> 01:20:03,651
Don't cry.

1305
01:20:03,852 --> 01:20:06,082
That takes the cake!

1306
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:07,964
Who are the tears for?

1307
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:09,528
Brick?

1308
01:20:09,732 --> 01:20:10,767
Big Daddy?

1309
01:20:10,852 --> 01:20:11,921
Or for yourself?

1310
01:20:12,252 --> 01:20:14,083
Are you crying 'cause you're childless?

1311
01:20:14,172 --> 01:20:15,730
You know why she's got no kids?

1312
01:20:15,932 --> 01:20:19,129
Ask her big, beautiful husband.

1313
01:20:19,932 --> 01:20:22,526
You just won't let me do this
the nice way, will you?

1314
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,647
You always said I never loved Big Daddy.

1315
01:20:26,852 --> 01:20:28,285
How would you know?

1316
01:20:29,572 --> 01:20:30,800
How would he know?

1317
01:20:30,932 --> 01:20:32,809
Did he ever let anyone love him?

1318
01:20:33,012 --> 01:20:35,480
It was always Brick.
From the day he was born...

1319
01:20:35,572 --> 01:20:38,086
...he was always partial to Brick. Why?

1320
01:20:38,252 --> 01:20:40,812
Big Daddy wanted me to become a lawyer.
I did.

1321
01:20:41,012 --> 01:20:42,331
He said get married. I did.

1322
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:44,250
He said have kids. I did.

1323
01:20:44,452 --> 01:20:46,408
He said live in Memphis. I did.

1324
01:20:46,612 --> 01:20:49,126
Whatever he said to do, I did.

1325
01:20:50,332 --> 01:20:52,892
I don't give a damn
whether Big Daddy likes me...

1326
01:20:53,092 --> 01:20:54,650
...or did or never did...

1327
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:56,888
...or will or will never.

1328
01:20:58,172 --> 01:21:01,562
I've appealed for common decency
and fair play.

1329
01:21:01,772 --> 01:21:03,410
Now I'm telling you!

1330
01:21:03,732 --> 01:21:05,609
I intend to protect my interests.

1331
01:21:05,772 --> 01:21:08,332
I'm not a corporation lawyer for nothing.

1332
01:21:09,012 --> 01:21:10,968
Go get my briefcase out of our bedroom.

1333
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:19,130
It was...

1334
01:21:19,372 --> 01:21:21,966
It was the Cotton Bowl, Sister Woman.

1335
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:41,927
Pa?

1336
01:22:21,332 --> 01:22:23,892
- Give me your hand.
- I don't want your hand!

1337
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:16,367
No.

1338
01:23:16,572 --> 01:23:17,925
It's my pain.

1339
01:23:18,092 --> 01:23:19,844
That makes it my business.

1340
01:23:20,172 --> 01:23:22,925
I thought you went and hid yourself.
What do you want?

1341
01:23:23,172 --> 01:23:25,128
I came to apologize.

1342
01:23:26,572 --> 01:23:28,244
What for, telling me the truth?

1343
01:23:28,452 --> 01:23:31,649
- There must a dozen reasons.
- Save them.

1344
01:23:31,852 --> 01:23:34,366
I hate apologies. Especially for the truth.

1345
01:23:34,572 --> 01:23:37,530
Whatever you did, don't apologize.
Just don't do it again.

1346
01:23:37,732 --> 01:23:39,723
If you didn't do it, start doing it.

1347
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,923
Start by getting me a cigar
out of that coat.

1348
01:23:42,012 --> 01:23:44,526
- You think you ought to...
- Get me the cigar, boy!

1349
01:23:50,212 --> 01:23:51,201
It's wet from rain.

1350
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:55,171
You're all wet yourself.
It's a lousy joke, but it's true.

1351
01:23:58,892 --> 01:24:00,803
Modern science!

1352
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:14,291
Get me that...

1353
01:24:18,612 --> 01:24:19,442
...that robe.

1354
01:24:30,852 --> 01:24:33,764
- There's a bottle in that desk.
- I don't want a drink.

1355
01:24:33,972 --> 01:24:35,371
I do.

1356
01:24:35,532 --> 01:24:37,124
I want a drink.

1357
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:40,172
I've got a million clicks in my guts.

1358
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:43,841
Knives sharpening themselves.

1359
01:24:46,732 --> 01:24:48,848
You know about clicks, don't you?

1360
01:24:51,932 --> 01:24:54,162
So you bought me a birthday present, huh?

1361
01:24:55,452 --> 01:24:57,170
No, Maggie bought it.

1362
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:01,924
- She's got good taste that girl.
- In some things, yes...

1363
01:25:02,132 --> 01:25:03,804
...but not in men.

1364
01:25:06,612 --> 01:25:08,170
Nice soft material.

1365
01:25:08,572 --> 01:25:10,449
This is my soft birthday.

1366
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:13,883
Not my gold or silver.
This is my soft birthday.

1367
01:25:18,892 --> 01:25:20,484
Here's to my...

1368
01:25:20,652 --> 01:25:22,404
...last birthday.

1369
01:25:23,692 --> 01:25:25,683
Aren't you drinking to that?

1370
01:25:27,852 --> 01:25:29,444
Clickety-click.

1371
01:25:40,452 --> 01:25:42,602
You know what I'm going to do
before I die?

1372
01:25:43,852 --> 01:25:45,922
I'm going to open up all these boxes.

1373
01:25:48,172 --> 01:25:49,764
Will you look at this stuff?

1374
01:25:50,332 --> 01:25:51,447
Bought most of it...

1375
01:25:51,652 --> 01:25:54,166
...when I took your mother to Europe
on that tour.

1376
01:25:54,252 --> 01:25:56,971
Never had such a lousy time in my life.

1377
01:25:57,292 --> 01:26:00,011
That Europe is nothing
but a great big auction.

1378
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:03,841
Bunch of old worn-out places.
It's just a big fire sale.

1379
01:26:04,052 --> 01:26:06,043
Big Mama went wild in it.

1380
01:26:06,252 --> 01:26:08,812
She just bought and bought.

1381
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:12,410
She was lucky I'm a rich man.
Yes, it sure is lucky.

1382
01:26:13,172 --> 01:26:16,164
Got any idea what I'm worth? Ask Gooper.

1383
01:26:16,372 --> 01:26:18,966
He knows to the penny
unless I miss my guess.

1384
01:26:20,332 --> 01:26:23,847
Close on $10 million in cash
and blue-chip stocks...

1385
01:26:24,052 --> 01:26:26,771
...besides some 28,000 acres
of the richest land...

1386
01:26:26,972 --> 01:26:28,724
...this side of the Valley Nile.

1387
01:26:28,932 --> 01:26:31,048
That is pretty rich to be.

1388
01:26:33,732 --> 01:26:38,328
There's one thing you can't buy
in a Europe fire sale...

1389
01:26:38,852 --> 01:26:41,002
...or any other market on earth.

1390
01:26:41,612 --> 01:26:43,170
That's your life.

1391
01:26:45,932 --> 01:26:48,571
You can't buy back your life
when it's finished.

1392
01:26:48,812 --> 01:26:50,609
No, sir. Nobody can do that.

1393
01:26:52,252 --> 01:26:53,651
Feeling sorry for me or you?

1394
01:26:58,092 --> 01:26:59,047
For you, Papa.

1395
01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:01,772
That's good,
because you're going to miss me.

1396
01:27:03,812 --> 01:27:06,246
Why did you let Ma buy all this stuff?

1397
01:27:06,892 --> 01:27:10,680
The human animal is a beast
that eventually has to die.

1398
01:27:11,052 --> 01:27:14,328
If he's got money, he buys and he buys.

1399
01:27:15,212 --> 01:27:17,931
The reason why he buys everything he can,
is because...

1400
01:27:18,012 --> 01:27:21,846
...of a crazy hope that one of the things
he buys will be life everlasting...

1401
01:27:22,412 --> 01:27:24,243
...which it never can be.

1402
01:27:24,652 --> 01:27:28,247
I've suddenly noticed you don't call me
Big Daddy anymore.

1403
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:31,330
If you needed a Big Daddy,
why didn't you come to me?

1404
01:27:31,532 --> 01:27:35,366
If you wanted someone to lean on, why
Skipper? Why not me? I'm your father.

1405
01:27:35,652 --> 01:27:38,325
You should've come to your kinfolk.
Those who love you.

1406
01:27:38,412 --> 01:27:41,688
You don't know what love means.
To you it's another four-letter word.

1407
01:27:41,772 --> 01:27:43,251
You've got a short memory.

1408
01:27:43,532 --> 01:27:47,241
- What did you want that I didn't buy?
- You can't buy love!

1409
01:27:47,452 --> 01:27:50,683
You bought $1 million worth of junk!
Does it love you?

1410
01:27:50,892 --> 01:27:54,123
Who do you think I bought it for?
It's yours, the place, the money!

1411
01:27:54,332 --> 01:27:56,209
I don't want things!

1412
01:27:58,652 --> 01:28:00,290
We drew this up...

1413
01:28:02,412 --> 01:28:05,722
- We drew this up with the advice...
- Get out of the way.

1414
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,762
- Get out of my way.
- We're settling this first.

1415
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:12,844
- I don't want to see it.
- It's a sort of a plan. A preliminary.

1416
01:28:20,332 --> 01:28:21,811
Waste!

1417
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:32,725
Worthless!

1418
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:42,725
Worthless!

1419
01:29:03,812 --> 01:29:04,847
Don't, son.

1420
01:29:06,412 --> 01:29:07,845
Please don't cry.

1421
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:23,520
That's funny.

1422
01:29:24,132 --> 01:29:27,568
I never saw you cry before.
Did you ever cry as a kid?

1423
01:29:27,652 --> 01:29:32,009
Can't you understand?
I never wanted your place or money.

1424
01:29:32,292 --> 01:29:34,408
I don't want to own anything!

1425
01:29:34,612 --> 01:29:37,763
All I wanted was a father, not a boss!

1426
01:29:38,252 --> 01:29:40,288
I wanted you to love me.

1427
01:29:40,492 --> 01:29:41,971
I did and I do.

1428
01:29:43,012 --> 01:29:45,446
Not me and not Gooper,
and not even Mama.

1429
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:46,931
That's a lie.

1430
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:48,565
I loved her. I gave her...

1431
01:29:48,772 --> 01:29:51,730
Things, Papa, you gave her things.

1432
01:29:51,932 --> 01:29:54,366
A house, a trip to Europe, all this junk.

1433
01:29:54,572 --> 01:29:58,042
Some jewelry.
You gave her things, not love.

1434
01:29:59,692 --> 01:30:01,489
I gave her an empire.

1435
01:30:01,692 --> 01:30:04,490
I've seen you out there on your empire...

1436
01:30:04,692 --> 01:30:07,729
...with the men who run it for you.
You don't know their names...

1437
01:30:07,932 --> 01:30:11,402
...or if they've kids or are happy.
You've never looked into their faces.

1438
01:30:11,492 --> 01:30:14,962
What are faces? You don't build an empire
by remembering faces.

1439
01:30:15,212 --> 01:30:18,090
Next week,
I'll start building that textile plant.

1440
01:30:18,292 --> 01:30:22,080
I'll not only grow my own cotton,
I'll weave it and market it.

1441
01:30:22,252 --> 01:30:22,968
I'll tell you...

1442
01:30:23,172 --> 01:30:25,481
...in a year or two from now...

1443
01:30:40,572 --> 01:30:44,645
The men who build empires die,
and empires die too.

1444
01:30:45,292 --> 01:30:46,520
No, it won't.

1445
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:48,643
That's why I've got you and Gooper.

1446
01:30:48,852 --> 01:30:50,046
Look at Gooper.

1447
01:30:50,252 --> 01:30:53,483
Look at what he's become.
Is that what you wanted him to be?

1448
01:30:53,692 --> 01:30:55,125
Look at me.

1449
01:30:55,452 --> 01:30:59,491
You were right. I am a 30-year-old kid.
And pretty soon I'll be a 50-year-old kid.

1450
01:30:59,692 --> 01:31:02,889
I don't know what to believe in.
What's the good of living?

1451
01:31:03,092 --> 01:31:06,482
There's got to be some purpose in life,
some meaning.

1452
01:31:07,092 --> 01:31:10,562
Look at me, for the sake of God,
before it's too late!

1453
01:31:10,732 --> 01:31:13,485
For once, look at me as I really am.

1454
01:31:13,692 --> 01:31:14,920
Look at me!

1455
01:31:16,332 --> 01:31:17,845
I'm a failure. I'm a drunk.

1456
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:21,442
On my own in the open market,
I'm not worth the price of a decent burial.

1457
01:31:21,652 --> 01:31:26,009
- All of you blame me for everything, huh?
- No, Papa.

1458
01:31:29,372 --> 01:31:32,284
We've known each other all my life
and we're strangers.

1459
01:31:32,892 --> 01:31:37,249
You own 28,000 acres.
You own $10 million.

1460
01:31:37,452 --> 01:31:41,650
You own a wife and two children.
You own us, but you don't love us.

1461
01:31:42,612 --> 01:31:45,080
- In my own way...
- No, sir.

1462
01:31:45,492 --> 01:31:47,483
You don't even like people.

1463
01:31:48,412 --> 01:31:51,609
You wanted Gooper and me to have kids.
Why?

1464
01:31:52,732 --> 01:31:56,611
I want a part of me to keep living.
I won't have it end with the grave.

1465
01:31:56,812 --> 01:31:57,961
Look!

1466
01:31:58,572 --> 01:32:01,006
This is what my father left me.

1467
01:32:01,212 --> 01:32:02,645
This lousy old suitcase!

1468
01:32:03,332 --> 01:32:05,527
On the inside was nothing...

1469
01:32:05,732 --> 01:32:09,281
...but his uniform
from the Spanish-American War.

1470
01:32:09,492 --> 01:32:11,722
This was his legacy to me.

1471
01:32:11,932 --> 01:32:13,524
Nothing at all!

1472
01:32:15,532 --> 01:32:18,330
And I built this place from nothing.

1473
01:32:23,172 --> 01:32:25,242
And that's all he left you?

1474
01:32:25,612 --> 01:32:28,046
Yeah, he was a hobo.

1475
01:32:29,612 --> 01:32:32,365
Best-known tramp on the boxcar circuit.

1476
01:32:32,572 --> 01:32:35,962
He worked once in a while as a field hand.
I'd tag along.

1477
01:32:36,572 --> 01:32:39,848
Sat on my bare bottom, in the dirt,
waiting for him.

1478
01:32:41,292 --> 01:32:42,964
Outside of hunger...

1479
01:32:43,172 --> 01:32:45,527
...first thing I could remember is shame.

1480
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:48,451
I was ashamed
of that miserable, old tramp.

1481
01:32:48,892 --> 01:32:53,044
I was riding boxcars when I was nine,
something you never had to do.

1482
01:32:53,252 --> 01:32:56,483
And you'll never have to bury me
like I did him.

1483
01:32:57,172 --> 01:33:00,323
I buried him in a meadow,
alongside a railroad track.

1484
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:03,768
We were running to catch a freight
and his heart gave out.

1485
01:33:06,692 --> 01:33:08,091
You know something?

1486
01:33:09,372 --> 01:33:11,488
That lousy old tramp died laughing.

1487
01:33:11,692 --> 01:33:13,284
Laughing at what?

1488
01:33:14,252 --> 01:33:16,049
Himself, I guess.

1489
01:33:16,252 --> 01:33:17,651
A hobo tramp...

1490
01:33:17,852 --> 01:33:21,561
...not a nickel in his jeans.
No future, no past.

1491
01:33:23,052 --> 01:33:26,727
Or maybe he was laughing
because he was happy.

1492
01:33:27,612 --> 01:33:29,443
Happy at having you with him.

1493
01:33:29,612 --> 01:33:32,331
He took you everywhere
and he kept you with him.

1494
01:33:34,092 --> 01:33:35,969
I don't want to talk about that.

1495
01:33:50,732 --> 01:33:52,450
Yeah, I loved him.

1496
01:33:56,332 --> 01:33:59,130
I reckon I never loved anything
as much as that...

1497
01:33:59,332 --> 01:34:00,970
...lousy old tramp.

1498
01:34:02,732 --> 01:34:04,085
And you say...

1499
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:06,601
...he left you nothing but a suitcase...

1500
01:34:06,812 --> 01:34:10,168
...with a uniform in it
from the Spanish-American War?

1501
01:34:10,692 --> 01:34:12,330
And some memories.

1502
01:34:13,612 --> 01:34:14,806
And love.

1503
01:34:20,452 --> 01:34:22,727
Did I tell you all them stories
about my old man?

1504
01:34:22,932 --> 01:34:24,445
About fifty times.

1505
01:34:38,092 --> 01:34:41,448
It's a plan to protect the Delta's
biggest estate from irresponsibility.

1506
01:34:41,532 --> 01:34:42,487
You have to sign.

1507
01:34:45,612 --> 01:34:47,330
Where is it?

1508
01:34:48,172 --> 01:34:48,809
What?

1509
01:34:48,932 --> 01:34:52,129
What the doctor left
to make his pain easier.

1510
01:34:52,772 --> 01:34:56,321
Brick's down there with him.
He'll help Big Daddy.

1511
01:34:56,532 --> 01:34:57,931
Help him? How?

1512
01:34:58,132 --> 01:35:00,123
By running the 100-yard dash?

1513
01:35:00,332 --> 01:35:03,244
Maybe he'll cheer him up
by kicking some field goals.

1514
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:06,251
One more crack, Queenie...

1515
01:35:06,412 --> 01:35:10,644
...and I will not only spit in your eye
but I will punch it black and blue.

1516
01:35:10,732 --> 01:35:11,562
Hold on a minute!

1517
01:35:11,652 --> 01:35:14,166
- I'm not listening to any more...
- Mae was only saying...

1518
01:35:14,252 --> 01:35:16,891
I know what she said,
and I know exactly what she meant.

1519
01:35:16,972 --> 01:35:18,769
The only world that Brick knows...

1520
01:35:18,852 --> 01:35:21,002
It's not a world he made.

1521
01:35:25,132 --> 01:35:26,008
Ladies!

1522
01:35:27,852 --> 01:35:30,207
- No.
- Why won't you take it?

1523
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:34,369
- It'll kill the pain, that's all.
- It'll kill the senses, too.

1524
01:35:34,572 --> 01:35:37,211
When you've got pain
at least you know you're alive.

1525
01:35:43,052 --> 01:35:44,963
It's easing somewhat now.

1526
01:35:46,892 --> 01:35:48,564
When you've got pain...

1527
01:35:48,972 --> 01:35:51,884
...it's better to judge yourself,
a lot of things.

1528
01:35:52,092 --> 01:35:54,481
I'm not going to stupefy myself
with that stuff.

1529
01:35:54,572 --> 01:35:56,164
I want to think clear.

1530
01:35:56,372 --> 01:35:58,761
I want to see everything
and feel everything.

1531
01:35:58,972 --> 01:36:00,644
Then I won't mind going.

1532
01:36:01,772 --> 01:36:03,842
I've got the guts to die.

1533
01:36:04,052 --> 01:36:06,885
What I want to know is,
have you got the guts to live?

1534
01:36:07,252 --> 01:36:08,651
I don't know.

1535
01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:11,411
We can try.

1536
01:36:13,252 --> 01:36:16,164
We could start by helping each other
up these stairs.

1537
01:36:28,172 --> 01:36:29,321
Yes, sir.

1538
01:36:32,772 --> 01:36:33,841
At least read them.

1539
01:36:33,972 --> 01:36:36,122
Put those papers away
before I tear them up.

1540
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:38,482
I don't want to know what's in them.

1541
01:36:38,692 --> 01:36:42,970
I'm talking in Big Daddy's language.
I'm his wife, not his widow. His wife!

1542
01:36:43,332 --> 01:36:45,607
- What I've got here...
- He said it's just a plan.

1543
01:36:45,692 --> 01:36:49,367
Plan basis. What I'll say to your plan is...

1544
01:36:50,932 --> 01:36:53,924
What is it Big Daddy says
when he's disgusted?

1545
01:36:54,132 --> 01:36:56,965
He says "bull" when he's disgusted.

1546
01:36:57,132 --> 01:36:59,726
That's right. I say "bull" like Big Daddy.

1547
01:36:59,932 --> 01:37:02,685
- Coarse language don't seem called for.
- Bull!

1548
01:37:02,892 --> 01:37:04,803
I am outraged by this kind of talk.

1549
01:37:04,892 --> 01:37:07,884
Then stop talking like your father's dead
and me along with him.

1550
01:37:07,972 --> 01:37:09,928
What about her? She wants her share, too.

1551
01:37:11,132 --> 01:37:13,202
As far as Brick is concerned...

1552
01:37:13,412 --> 01:37:15,846
...nobody's going to take nothing.

1553
01:37:16,052 --> 01:37:17,690
Not till Big Daddy lets go...

1554
01:37:17,892 --> 01:37:21,771
...and maybe just possibly, not even then!

1555
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,003
No, Mama, not even then.

1556
01:37:28,012 --> 01:37:29,730
Hello, Bucky!

1557
01:37:32,492 --> 01:37:35,211
Looks like the wind took some liberties
with this place.

1558
01:37:35,372 --> 01:37:37,044
- Evening, Cap'n!
- Evening, Cap'n!

1559
01:37:37,132 --> 01:37:39,726
- Storm cross over the river?
- Gone to Arkansas.

1560
01:37:39,932 --> 01:37:41,604
Rain do some good, Cap'n?

1561
01:37:41,772 --> 01:37:43,364
Some good, I reckon.

1562
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:46,520
Some good.

1563
01:37:48,172 --> 01:37:49,525
You could at least read them.

1564
01:37:49,612 --> 01:37:52,649
Put them away before I tear them up.
I don't know what's in them.

1565
01:37:52,812 --> 01:37:54,245
I don't want to know.

1566
01:37:55,772 --> 01:37:56,966
Can I come in?

1567
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:01,366
Has the storm done any damage?

1568
01:38:01,572 --> 01:38:04,086
Which storm are you talking about?
The one outside...

1569
01:38:04,172 --> 01:38:06,083
...or that hullabaloo going on in here?

1570
01:38:14,452 --> 01:38:15,567
Excuse me, sir.

1571
01:38:15,892 --> 01:38:20,204
Heard some mighty loud talking.
What's the powwow about?

1572
01:38:20,572 --> 01:38:23,484
Nothing, Big Daddy. Nothing at all.

1573
01:38:23,972 --> 01:38:26,964
What's in them important-looking
documents you've got there?

1574
01:38:27,372 --> 01:38:29,932
Nothing. Nothing much of anything at all.

1575
01:38:30,212 --> 01:38:34,569
Then what are you and Sister Woman
scurrying and scrounging around for?

1576
01:38:35,172 --> 01:38:37,606
Looks like a whole lot of nothing to me.

1577
01:38:40,772 --> 01:38:42,808
What's that smell in this room?

1578
01:38:43,612 --> 01:38:45,284
Didn't you notice it, Brick?

1579
01:38:45,932 --> 01:38:49,561
Didn't you notice the powerful
and obnoxious odor of mendacity?

1580
01:38:52,972 --> 01:38:55,440
Yes, sir, I think I did.

1581
01:38:55,652 --> 01:38:58,883
Ain't nothing more powerful
than the odor of mendacity.

1582
01:38:59,972 --> 01:39:02,327
- Didn't you notice it, Gooper?
- What, sir?

1583
01:39:02,572 --> 01:39:04,528
What about you, Sister Woman?

1584
01:39:04,732 --> 01:39:08,247
Didn't you notice an unpleasant smell
of mendacity in this room?

1585
01:39:08,732 --> 01:39:10,927
I don't even know what that is.

1586
01:39:11,132 --> 01:39:14,568
You can smell it. It smells like death.

1587
01:39:19,092 --> 01:39:22,880
What's the matter with that woman?
What's-your-name, what's wrong?

1588
01:39:23,252 --> 01:39:26,050
She just had a slight dizzy spell.

1589
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,561
You'd better watch that.
A stroke's a bad way to go.

1590
01:39:31,252 --> 01:39:34,767
Look, he's wearing
Brick's birthday present.

1591
01:39:35,932 --> 01:39:39,368
I haven't given you my present yet
but I will now.

1592
01:39:39,692 --> 01:39:41,364
I have an announcement.

1593
01:39:41,572 --> 01:39:43,324
What kind of an announcement?

1594
01:39:44,732 --> 01:39:46,848
An announcement of life beginning.

1595
01:39:49,292 --> 01:39:51,123
A child is coming...

1596
01:39:52,172 --> 01:39:54,606
...sired by Brick out of Maggie the cat.

1597
01:39:58,412 --> 01:40:00,607
I have Brick's child in my body.

1598
01:40:01,452 --> 01:40:03,408
And that is my present to you.

1599
01:40:03,852 --> 01:40:07,481
Did you ever in your born days
hear such a bald-faced lie?

1600
01:40:07,692 --> 01:40:08,807
Shut up.

1601
01:40:10,572 --> 01:40:11,891
Thank you.

1602
01:40:12,092 --> 01:40:13,810
Thank you very much.

1603
01:40:26,732 --> 01:40:30,361
Yes, indeed, this girl has life in her body.

1604
01:40:31,372 --> 01:40:32,964
And that's no lie.

1605
01:40:33,892 --> 01:40:37,168
I want my lawyer in the morning.
My lawyer!

1606
01:40:38,732 --> 01:40:40,768
- Brick?
- Yes, Big Daddy?

1607
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:46,324
I'm going out to look this place over
before I give it up.

1608
01:40:46,812 --> 01:40:48,848
The place and the people on it.

1609
01:40:54,852 --> 01:40:56,251
You want to come with me?

1610
01:41:09,612 --> 01:41:11,728
What were you two talking about
down there?

1611
01:41:11,812 --> 01:41:12,688
Us.

1612
01:41:13,092 --> 01:41:14,207
Me, too?

1613
01:41:15,052 --> 01:41:15,689
Yeah.

1614
01:41:15,892 --> 01:41:18,531
You ripped your own brother apart.

1615
01:41:19,812 --> 01:41:21,404
Do you believe that, Gooper?

1616
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:26,811
- No.
- Well, I do!

1617
01:41:27,012 --> 01:41:27,922
Keep still.

1618
01:41:28,132 --> 01:41:32,250
A family crisis brings out the best
and the worst in every member.

1619
01:41:32,572 --> 01:41:33,971
That's the truth.

1620
01:41:34,212 --> 01:41:35,361
Amen.

1621
01:41:36,332 --> 01:41:39,529
You want to talk about the truth?
You're not pregnant.

1622
01:41:39,692 --> 01:41:41,045
- Be still.
- She made it up.

1623
01:41:41,252 --> 01:41:44,369
- I said shut up.
- Don't you try to kid us.

1624
01:41:45,812 --> 01:41:47,530
She's not kidding you.

1625
01:41:47,732 --> 01:41:51,008
How can she have a child by you,
when you won't even...

1626
01:41:51,252 --> 01:41:52,162
Keep quiet!

1627
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:55,887
We occupy the next room
and the walls aren't soundproof.

1628
01:41:56,092 --> 01:42:00,404
We hear the nightly pleading
and the nightly refusals!

1629
01:42:00,612 --> 01:42:03,570
Not everybody makes as much noise
about love as you do.

1630
01:42:07,212 --> 01:42:10,648
I never thought you would stoop
to her level!

1631
01:42:10,732 --> 01:42:13,929
You heard what Big Daddy said,
"That girl's got life in her body."

1632
01:42:14,012 --> 01:42:15,650
- That's a lie!
- No.

1633
01:42:17,052 --> 01:42:19,520
No, truth is something desperate,
and Maggie's got it.

1634
01:42:19,612 --> 01:42:22,922
Believe me, it is desperate,
and she has got it.

1635
01:42:24,532 --> 01:42:27,330
Why don't you say something, honey?

1636
01:42:27,852 --> 01:42:29,365
All right, honey.

1637
01:42:29,572 --> 01:42:30,607
Shut up!

1638
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:35,847
Yes?

1639
01:42:36,012 --> 01:42:37,604
Come on up here.

1640
01:42:38,852 --> 01:42:39,887
Yes, sir!

1641
01:42:49,412 --> 01:42:51,368
That girl's got life in her, all right.

1642
01:42:54,332 --> 01:42:56,892
Thank you for keeping still.

1643
01:42:57,212 --> 01:42:59,328
For backing me up in my lie.

1644
01:43:01,372 --> 01:43:04,967
We are through with lies
and liars in this house.

1645
01:43:06,692 --> 01:43:07,886
Lock the door.

1646
