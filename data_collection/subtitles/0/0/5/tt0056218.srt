1
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,411
- Joint raided!
- No!

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,581
That's just our Raymond,
our lovable Sgt. Shaw.

3
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,549
All right. Let's go, you men.
Come on.

4
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,087
Let's go.

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,386
Come on, Sarge.
Gertrude buy you beer.

6
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,692
What's the matter with him?

7
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:36,458
I'm afraid our Saint Raymond,
he don't approve.

8
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,601
Maybe he's got a girl back home,
or something.

9
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,092
Him? Our Raymond?
Are you kidding?

10
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,807
- Silvers, how about the robe?
- What are you talking? Get out.

11
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,606
Bad here.

12
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,275
- How do you know?
- Chunjin born two miles from here.

13
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:26,546
So far, every place we've been in Korea,
this joker was born two miles from it.

14
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,114
What's so bad about it?

15
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,651
Tricky. Swamp all around.
Thirty yards up, maybe quicksand.

16
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,915
Nobody said anything about quicksand.

17
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,853
Can't we go around it?

18
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,094
- No, Sergeant.
- What's your personal advice?

19
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,264
All walk in single line,
next 200 yards.

20
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,366
Not tactical to travel forward
in a single line.

21
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,799
Patrol sink.

22
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,371
We go around it.

23
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,439
- No, Sergeant.
- Never mind.

24
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,872
Okay, pass the word.

25
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,702
<i>Ths naton jealously guards</i>

00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,971

28
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,744
<i>only men were so honored.</i>

29
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,818
<i>One of these men</i>

30
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,689
<i>Raymond Shaw was returned from combat</i>

34
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,312
Congratulations, son.
How do you feel?

35
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,213
Like Capt. Idiot
in Astounding Science Comics.

36
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,649
Hold it, General.

37
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,948
Hold it, General, please. Come on.
Get in there quickly.

38
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,586
Mother, what is this?
What are you doing here?

39
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,507
Sen. Iselin, how does it feel to be
the father of a Medal of Honor winner?

40
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,977
- He is not my father.
- The Senator is Raymond's stepfather.

41
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,879
I can only say that, as one...

42
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,816
who has devoted his life
to the service of his country...

43
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,684
You did this...

44
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,420
You did this, Mother. You organized
this disgusting three-ring circus.

45
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,723
You're a Medal of Honor winner.
Incidentally, congratulations.

46
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:42,528
I would have written, but we've been
in a frightful mess the last few months.

47
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,531
All right, let him through!

48
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,227
That's enough, now.
Let him through.

49
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,266
Say 'cheese.'

50
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,075
All right, that's enough, now.
Let the poor boy through.

51
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,542
Please, let him through.

52
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,416
What is the matter, Raymond?
We've gone to a lot of trouble to...

53
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,419
- Arrange the parade foryou.
- The parade?

54
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,323
Get that out. Your sick...

55
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,859
Just because your parents
and the entire country...

56
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,994
- are proud of you...
- Who's kidding who, Mother?

57
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,499
Johnny's up for re-election in November.
You've got it all figured out, haven't you?

58
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,369
Johnny Iselin's boy, Medal of Honor winner
That should get you 50,000 votes.

59
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,506
Raymond, I'm your mother.
How can you talk to me this way?

60
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,874
I want nothing for myself.

61
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,544
My entire life is devoted
to helping you and to helping Johnny.

62
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,480
- My boys, my two little boys.
- Mother, stop it.

63
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,681
That is all I have.

64
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,217
<i>On the afternoon of hs arrval</i>

75
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,493
A gift from the Citizens For Iselin
Committee for his last birthday.

76
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,628
It absolutely saved our lives
during the campaign.

77
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,823
You see,
this opens up into a double bed.

78
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,762
This is the Press Room.

79
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:35,975
And this is my private office.

80
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,045
Anything to take the pain
out of campaigning, eh?

81
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,036
That's what I always say.

82
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:47,086
- May I take this thing off now, Mother?
- Raymond, what is the matter with you?

83
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,289
You look as if your head were going
to come to a point in seconds.

84
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,359
Johnny, fix him a drink or something.
Sit down, Raymond. Relax.

85
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,761
We'll be home in less than
two-and-a-half hours.

86
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,798
I'm not going home with you, Mother.
I'm going to New York.

87
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,466
What?

88
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,602
I've got a job on a newspaper.

89
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,237
Research Assistant
to Mr. Holborn Gaines.

90
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,940
Holborn Gaines, that Communist?

91
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,611
He's not a Communist, Mother.
As a matter of fact, he's a Republican.

92
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,705
But the terrible things he's written
about Johnny...

93
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,651
He came to interview me
at the White House this morning.

94
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,711
Afterwards, I asked him for a job.
He gave it to me.

95
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,391
We discovered that we had
a great deal in common.

96
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:30,162
What could you possibly have in common
with that dreadful old man?

97
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:34,656
For one thing, we discovered that we
both loathe and despise you and Johnny.

98
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,834
And that's a beginning.

99
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,712
<i>The war n Korea was over.</i>

100
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,515
<i>Captan, now Major, Bennett Marco</i>
<i>had been reassgned...</i>

101
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,575
<i>to Army Intellgence</i>
<i>n Washngton.</i>

102
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,189
<i>It was, by and large,</i>
<i>a pleasant assgnment...</i>

103
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,058
<i>except for one thng.</i>

104
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:04,394
<i>Nght after nght, the major was plagued</i>
<i>by the same reoccurrng nghtmare.</i>

105
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,448
Stop it. Stop it.

106
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,728
Another modern discovery,
which we owe to the hydrangea...

107
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:40,800
concerns the influence of air-drainage
upon plant climate.

108
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,836
Many years ago, when I was traveling
about the country...

109
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,973
I noticed magnificent hydrangeas
on the hills...

110
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,644
where the air-drainage
was perfect...

111
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:57,116
and very poor specimens, or perhaps
none at all, in the valleys.

112
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,419
Formerly, we used to consider
sheltered valleys...

113
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,389
more favorable to plants
than hilltops...

114
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,093
but the avoidance of late spring
and early autumn frosts...

115
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,662
enjoyed by sites
with good air-drainage...

116
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,466
where the cold air can drain safely
away to lower levels...

117
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,069
gives the hills a decided advantage.

118
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,639
Thus it was the hydrangeas that gave
the first pointer...

119
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,745
in another modern discovery
of horticultural importance.

120
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,982
From this, it might appearthat
the hydrangea is a fairly simple plant.

121
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,818
But there are more complications.

122
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,821
The cultivation of hydrangeas
was evolved from...

123
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,391
a number of varieties
originally found in Japan...

124
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:43,963
not all of which, of course,
have the same characteristics.

125
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,799
Two of them do not share the quality
of producing...

126
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,166
blue flowers in
mineral-rich soils.

127
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,514
Allow me to introduce
our American visitors.

128
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:05,117
I must ask you to forgive their
somewhat lackadaisical manners...

129
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,287
but I have conditioned them,
or 'brainwashed' them...

130
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,123
which I understand
is the new American word...

131
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:16,262
to believe that they are
in the lobby of a hotel in New Jersey...

132
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,266
where a meeting of the Ladies'
Garden Club is in progress.

133
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:24,327
You will notice that I have told them
they may smoke.

134
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,140
I have allowed my people
to have a little fun...

135
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,304
in the selection
of bizarre tobacco substitutes.

136
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,041
Are you enjoying your cigarette, Ed?

137
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,485
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,582
'Tastes good,
like a cigarette should.'

139
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,394
Now then, comrades...

140
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,363
may I present
the famous Raymond Shaw...

141
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:57,469
the young man you've flown 80,000 miles
to this dreary spot in Manchuria to see.

142
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,438
Raymond, pull your chair over here
by me, please.

143
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,345
I am sure you've all heard
the old wives' tale...

144
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,814
that no hypnotized
subject may be forced...

145
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:13,919
to do that which is repellent to his
moral nature, whateverthat may be.

146
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,788
Nonsense, of course.

147
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:21,126
You note-takers might set down
a reminderto consult Brenman's paper.

148
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:26,465
<i>Experments n the Hypnotc Producton</i>
<i>of Ant-Socal and Self-lnjurous Behavor.</i>

149
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,402
Or Wells' paper which was titled,
I believe...

150
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:34,273
<i>Experments n the Hypnotc</i>
<i>Producton of Crme.</i>

151
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,076
Or, of course, Andrew Salter's
remarkable book...

152
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,812
<i>Condtoned Reflex Therapy...</i>

153
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,147
to name only three.

154
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,683
Or if it offends you
that only the West is working...

155
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,820
to manufacture more crime
and better criminals...

156
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,456
against the modern shortages...

157
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,258
I suggest Krasnogorski's...

158
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,760
Primary violence Motivation...

159
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,265
or Serov's The Unilateral Suggestion
to Self-Destruction.

160
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:05,037
My dear Yen, as you grow older,
you grow more long-winded.

161
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,373
Can't we get to the point?

162
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,875
Has the man ever killed anyone?

163
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,343
Or has he not?

164
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,280
I apologize, my dear Dimitri.

165
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,616
I keep forgetting that you're a young
country and your attention span is limited.

166
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,490
Tell me, Raymond,
have you ever killed anyone?

167
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,425
- No, ma'am.
- Not even in combat?

168
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,319
In combat?

169
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,565
Yes, ma'am, I think so.

170
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,301
Of course you have, Raymond.

171
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,970
Raymond has been a crack shot
since childhood.

172
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,373
Marvelous outlet
for his aggressions.

173
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,175
May I have the bayonet,
please?

174
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,712
Not with the knife.
With the hands.

175
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,547
With the hands?

176
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,412
Here, have him use this.

177
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:03,295
Raymond, whom do you dislike the least
in your group here today?

178
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,763
- The least?
- That's right.

179
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,668
I guess Capt. Marco, ma'am.

180
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,972
Notice how he is always
drawn to authority?

181
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,673
That won't do, Raymond.

182
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,009
We need the captain
to get you your medal.

183
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,178
Whom else?

184
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,948
- I guess Ed Mavole, ma'am.
- That's better.

185
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,611
Now then, Raymond,
take this scarf...

186
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:34,393
and strangle Ed Mavole
to death.

187
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,883
Yes, ma'am.

188
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,861
Excuse me, Ben.

189
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,370
Pardon me.

190
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,880
Hey, Sarge, cut it out.

191
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,849
Quiet, Ed, please.

192
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,986
Now, you just sit there quietly
and cooperate.

193
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,385
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,801
Major, to your knowledge...

195
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,396
have any other ex-members of your
patrol had similar dreams?

196
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,331
No, sir, not to my knowledge.

197
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,313
Doesn't it strike
any one as curious...

198
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,544
that Mavole was one of the two men
lost in the action?

199
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,819
Yet, every night in my dream...

200
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,089
he's the one that Raymond...

201
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,862
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

202
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,531
Now look, Maj. Marco...

203
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,401
since you first brought this recurring
dream of yours to our attention...

204
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,304
Raymond Shaw, his life,
his background, his habits...

205
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,607
his friends and associates have been
under scrupulous examination.

206
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,210
The facts speak forthemselves.

207
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,879
His stepfather is
a United States senator.

208
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:04,083
His mother is head of different
patriotic organizations.

209
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,686
Raymond himself works as confidential
assistant to Holborn Gaines...

210
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,122
the most respected
political journalist in America.

211
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,558
It's inconceivable that anything...

212
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,393
As the consulting
psychiatrist present...

213
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,988
I'd be interested in hearing
your personal feelings about Shaw.

214
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,869
Raymond Shaw is the kindest,
bravest, warmest...

215
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,905
most wonderful human being
I've ever known in my life.

216
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,474
I see.

217
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,477
And this opinion, Major,
was it generally held?

218
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,947
His fellow soldiers, did they feel
the same way toward him?

219
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,416
The men loved him, sir.

220
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,985
Why shouldn't they?
He saved their lives.

221
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,688
It would seem obvious to me...

222
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,923
that Maj. Marco is suffering
a delayed reaction...

223
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,560
to 18 months of continuous
combat in Korea.

224
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,364
I strongly recommend that the matter of
Raymond Shaw be dropped here and now...

225
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:56,535
and that Maj. Marco
be temporarily reassigned...

226
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,071
to less strenuous and, if I may say so,
less sensitive duties.

227
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:03,742
I think a few months'
detached service...

228
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,178
to, perhaps, the Public
Relations Corps...

229
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,348
should put the Major right
back in the pink.

230
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,150
Mr. Secretary...

231
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,519
Mr. Secretary, can you explain
the proposed cut in budget?

232
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,057
Since, sir, you've asked
a simple-minded question...

233
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,361
I will give you an equally
simple-minded answer.

234
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,764
Since no great naval power
menaces the free world today...

235
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:30,035
the Navy's overwhelming preponderance
of surface ships seems to be superfluous.

236
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,304
Hence the cut in budget.

237
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,040
Major, my time is important.

238
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,310
How much longer must we go on
with this nonsense?

239
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,940
If there are no further questions,
I think that about wraps things up.

240
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:48,353
Mr. Secretary,
I have a question, sir.

241
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,055
Who are you, sir?

242
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,892
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin.

243
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,461
And I have a question so serious...

244
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,761
that the safety of our nation may well
depend on your answer.

245
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,093
Who?

246
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,340
No evasions, Mr. Secretary,
no evasions, if you please, sir.

247
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,776
Evasions? What the hell
are you talking about?

248
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,444
What kind of foolishness is this?

249
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,781
I'm new at this job, but I don't
think it's good public relations...

250
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,617
to talk that way to a senator,
even if he is an idiot.

251
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,254
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin...

252
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:27,192
and I have here a list
of the names of <i>270</i> persons...

253
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,028
who are known
by the Secretary of Defense...

254
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,599
as being members of
the Communist Party...

255
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,035
and who are still, nevertheless,
working at shaping the policy...

256
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:41,073
of the Defense Department!

257
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,877
- Senator who?
- I demand an answer.

258
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,247
There will be no covering up, sir.

259
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,016
- What?
- No covering up.

260
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,020
- You won't get your hands on this list.
- How did you get in here in the first place?

261
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,457
- Major, throw that lunatic out of here.
- And I deeply regret having to say...

262
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,794
- in front of these ladies and gentlemen...
- You claim to be a senator?

263
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:08,367
...and the radio audience of our great nation
that you no longer have my confidence.

264
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,569
You're an idiot, if you ask me.
You're out of your mind.

265
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:15,240
This is no longer a matterfor investigation
by the Defense Department.

266
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,009
Get out of here!

267
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,112
- I'm afraid you've lost your chance.
- Get that man out of this room.

268
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:26,485
This matter is now the responsibility
of the United States Senate.

269
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,422
I will not have him in here,
do you hear me? Not ever!

270
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,760
If I ever catch you in this room again,
I'll throw you out bodily.

271
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,762
What do you want?
Get out of here.

272
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,097
- Hold it.
- Don't you take my picture anymore.

273
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,894
Clearthis room!

274
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:46,405
Sen. Iselin.
I'd like to verify that number, sir.

275
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,874
How many Communists did you say?

276
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,176
I said there are exactly...

277
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,011
I have proof there are...

278
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,148
104 card-carrying Communists
in the Defense Department.

279
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,849
How many, sir?

280
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,920
275, and that's all I have to say
on the subject at this time.

281
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,922
Major, how many did he say?

282
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,253
Excuse me just a moment.

283
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,817
Major, how many did he say?

284
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,907
- Very good, Raymond.
- Thank you, ma'am.

285
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,710
- Capt. Marco?
- Yes.

286
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,812
On yourfeet, Captain, please.
Sorry, ma'am.

287
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,177
Sorry, ma'am.

288
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,818
When you are returned
with your patrol to Korea...

289
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,688
and you make your way
to Command Headquarters...

290
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,680
what will be the first duty
you will undertake?

291
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,561
I will make my report
on the patrol, ma'am.

292
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,064
What will you report?

293
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,932
I will recommend urgently...

294
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,202
that Raymond Shaw be posted
forthe Medal of Honor.

295
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:28,707
He saved our lives and took out
a complete company of Chinese infantry.

296
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,076
A complete company?
What the hell is this?

297
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:36,481
We can spare an imaginary company
of infantry forthis particular plan...

298
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,251
- Mikhail Mikhailovich.
- All right.

299
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,054
If we are out to humiliate
our brave Chinese ally...

300
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,290
in the newspapers of the world...

301
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,460
we might as well make it
a full battalion.

302
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,197
We don't object, Comrade,
I assure you of that.

303
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:56,463
However, Comrade, we thank you for
thinking of the matter in that light.

304
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,265
If we may proceed
with the demonstration...

305
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,445
who is that little fellow
sitting next to the Captain?

306
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,985
That's Bobby Lembeck...

307
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,621
our mascot, I guess you'd call him.

308
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,524
Doesn't look old enough
to be in your army.

309
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,788
I guess he isn't, but there he is, ma'am.

310
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:27,365
Capt. Marco, will you be good enough
to lend Raymond your pistol, please?

311
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,730
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,571
- Thanks, Ben.
- Sure, kid.

313
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,146
Shoot Bobby, Raymond.

314
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,011
Through the forehead.

315
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,432
Wake up, it's all right.

316
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,767
Everything's all right.

317
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,671
It's all right.

318
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,662
That same dream again?

319
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,780
What makes it so awful...

320
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,784
is to keep dreaming a thing
like that about Sgt. Shaw.

321
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,954
It's been going on for weeks, now.

322
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,990
I must be going crazy.

323
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,125
You ought to write to Sgt. Shaw.

324
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:32,290
- I tell you, nothing's wrong with me.
- Ask if anyone else is having similar dreams.

325
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,156
Maybe I will.

326
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,530
Maybe I'll do that.

327
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,108
If anybody can help me, he can.

328
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,810
You like him a lot, don't you?

329
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,746
Raymond Shaw is the bravest,
kindest, warmest...

330
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,408
most wonderful human being
I've ever known in my life.

331
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,576
<i>'Dear Sarge, I had to say ths</i>
<i>or wrte ths to someone...</i>

332
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,778
<i>'because I thnk I'm gong nuts.</i>

334
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,717
<i>'Sarge, I'm n trouble.</i>

335
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:36,554
<i>'I'm afrad to go to sleep</i>
<i>because I have terrble dreams.</i>

336
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,991

337
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,761

339
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,766
<i>'Well, t's pretty rough,</i>
<i>you have to take my word for that.'</i>

340
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:00,378
<i>- Raymond Shaw, please.</i>
- This is he.

341
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:05,247
<i>Raymond, why don't you pass the tme</i>
<i>by playng a lttle soltare?</i>

342
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,573
<i>Can you see the red queen?</i>

343
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,253
<i>Good.</i>

344
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:21,626
<i>One week from next Saturday,</i>

345
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,597
<i>at 11:10 a.m. And taken</i>

346
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,600
<i>84 East 61st Street.</i>

347
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,195
<i>We want you there for a checkup.</i>
<i>Is that clear?</i>

348
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,765
<i>You may put the cards away now.</i>
<i>Goodbye, Raymond.</i>

349
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,128
Mr. Gaines, it's Mr. Shaw.

350
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,931
He was run down on the street
by a hit-and-run driver.

351
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,566
It just came overthe AP.

352
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,368
Good heavens.

353
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,969
Find out what hospital he's in,
and call them.

354
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,130
See if there's anything
we can do to help.

355
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,809
You're welcome. Goodbye.

356
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,582
That was Mr. Gaines,
from his newspaper.

357
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,852
He said to tell him to take it easy
and not to worry about a thing.

358
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,721
Which, of course,
we will not tell him...

359
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,485
on the chance it is
some sort of pre-arranged code.

360
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,468
- Comrade zilkov?
- Yes?

361
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,232
Yen Lo. Pavlov Institute.

362
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:43,965
Doctor...

363
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,034
an honor and a pleasure.

364
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,647
You may go.

365
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,663
When did you arrive?

366
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,299
I was flown in last night
under embassy quota.

367
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,934
Revolting journey.

368
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,671
Raymond, it's nice to see you again.

369
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,969
It's nice to see you again, sir.

370
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,211
We're going through
this elaborate procedure...

371
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,947
simply out of precaution...

372
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,316
in case there are any visitors.

373
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,547
Although I cannot imagine
who will visit Raymond.

374
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:35,026
- Attractive plant you have here.
- Thank you, Doctor.

375
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,363
It's actually a rest home
for wealthy alcoholics.

376
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,627
We were able to purchase it
three years ago.

377
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:46,237
Except forthis floor and the floor above it,
which is sealed for security purposes...

378
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,239
the rest functions quite normally.

379
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,608
It is one of the few Soviet
operations in America...

380
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:54,112
that actually showed a profit
at the end of the last fiscal year.

381
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,807
Profit? Fiscal year?

382
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,818
Beware, my dear zilkov.
The virus of capitalism's highly infectious.

383
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,651
Soon, you'll be lending money out
at interest.

384
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,228
You must try, Comrade zilkov,
to cultivate a sense of humor.

385
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:15,033
There is nothing like a good laugh
to lighten the burdens o the day.

386
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,301
Tell me, Raymond...

387
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,004
do you remember murdering
Mavole and Lembeck?

388
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,873
I beg your pardon, sir?

389
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,042
Mavole and Lembeck...

390
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,711
the men who were lost
on the patrol.

391
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,906
Do you recall
what happened to them?

392
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:35,286
It was a very clear action
for a night action.

393
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,789
Capt. Marco sent up
some low flares...

394
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,825
so it was easy to see
what was happening.

395
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,828
Bobby Lembeck got separated
to the left.

396
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,489
Mavole went after him.

397
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,830
By the time he reached him,
the enemy had a fix on the position.

398
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:55,006
They were killed instantly
by a high mortar shell.

399
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,941
I don't think they ever knew
what hit them.

400
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,277
Do you realize, Comrade...

401
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:03,414
the implications of the weapon
that has been placed at your disposal?

402
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,439
You may remove
your head bandage, Raymond.

403
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,922
A normally conditioned
American...

404
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,092
who has been trained to kill and then
to have no memory of having killed.

405
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:18,229
Without memory of his deed,
he cannot possibly feel guilt.

406
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:22,300
Nor will he, of course, have any
reason to fear being caught.

407
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,538
Having been relieved of those uniquely
American symptoms guilt and fear...

408
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,530
he cannot possibly give himself away.

409
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:36,080
Our Raymond will remain
an outwardly normal, productive...

410
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,649
sober and respected member
of the community.

411
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:43,521
And, I should say, if properly used,
entirely police-proof.

412
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:49,460
His brain has not only been washed,
as they say, it has been dry-cleaned.

413
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,734
Thank you, Raymond,
you may replace your head bandage.

414
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,271
Sealed floors or no, you
will permit him visitors...

415
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,274
to avoid suspicion.

416
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,777
Ateam of my specialists
is being flown in tonight.

417
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,546
It will take about a week,
working between visiting hours...

418
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,480
to check the mechanism out
completely.

419
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:16,654
It has been two years since
the conditioning took place.

420
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,757
And you want to be sure the linkages
are still functioning correctly...

421
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,988
before he is turned over
to his American operator.

422
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,466
- Comrade, if you will excuse me.
- Where are you going?

423
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,536
Since I can do nothing more
until my specialists arrive...

424
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,173
I had thought to spend
the afternoon at Macy's.

425
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:39,007
Madame Yen has given me
the most appalling list.

426
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,786
I personally guarantee it. He is ready to be
turned overto his American operator.

427
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,390
And I, being personally responsible
for Soviet Security...

428
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,493
in the entire Eastern Seaboard
of the United States...

429
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,329
refuse to turn him over
to his operator...

430
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,466
until at least one practical test
has been run.

431
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,168
You say the man has been built
as an assassin.

432
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,695
Very well, then.
Let him assassinate someone.

433
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,612
I'm shocked that a security officer
with the responsibility you hold...

434
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,415
would risk a mechanism
as valuable as Raymond...

435
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,284
out of sheer nervousness.

436
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:25,223
You yourself admit the man has not
killed for overtwo years.

437
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:30,027
I assure you, Doctor, conditions
offering minimum risk can be arranged.

438
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,497
All right.
If you insist on this foolishness...

439
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,299
have him kill one of your own people
here on a sealed floor.

440
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,235
I would gladly.

441
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:41,339
But ourtable of organization happens to be
under acceptable strength as it is.

442
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,407
Why can't we be reasonable
about this?

443
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:47,678
Why can't he kill some
non-productive person on the outside?

444
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,313
Very well, then.

445
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:54,051
For his own protection, he must be
instructed that if he is ever...

446
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,654
discovered at the scene of an
assignment, this other person...

447
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,625
or persons must also be killed.

448
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:05,324
All right, doctor.
Whom do you think he should kill?

449
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:20,778
With humor, my dear zilkov,
always with a little humor.

450
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:26,317
If kill we must, for a better New York,
why should it not be...

451
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:31,789
his superior at the newspaper,
Mr. Holborn Gaines?

452
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,125
With Mr. Gaines out of the way...

453
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:39,119
might he not then be given
that very influential job himself?

454
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,200
Who's there?
It's me, Mr. Gaines.

455
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,327
It's me, Mr. Gaines.

456
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,529
Raymond.

457
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,911
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

458
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:58,082
Don't get any silly ideas about
this ridiculous-looking bed jacket.

459
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,519
It was my wife's.
It's the warmest thing I have.

460
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,155
Perfect for reading
in bed at night.

461
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,624
I didn't know
you were married, sir.

462
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,093
She died nearly six years ago.

463
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,829
What the devil are you doing here
at 4 a.m.

464
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,729
Anyway, I thought you were
in the hospital.

465
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:21,239
Don't tell me you've come here at
this ridiculous hourto talk something over.

466
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,844
You're not going to pour out your heart with
the details of a sordid love affair, are you?

467
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:31,949
As a matter of fact,
they told me you'd be asleep.

468
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,586
- Who told you I'd be asleep?
- They did.

469
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,088
They?

470
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,055
They?

471
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,318
Who are 'they'?

472
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,028
Who's this mysterious 'they'?

473
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,518
Answer me, my boy.

474
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,647
- Colonel.
- Ben.

475
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,208
- May I come in for a minute?
- Please do. Come on in.

476
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,859
May I ask A Is this an official visit?
And B May I mix you a drink?

477
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,761
AYes, it is,
and B You certainly may.

478
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,695
- Scotch all right?
- Fine.

479
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,092
My God, where do you
get all the books?

480
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,442
I got a guy who picks them out for me,
at random.

481
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,610
Water all right?

482
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,612
Fine.

483
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,148
He's in San Francisco.

484
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,450
Got a little bookstore out there...

485
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,153
and he ships them to me
wherever I happen to be stationed.

486
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,179
- You read them all?
- Yeah.

487
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,593
They'd also make great insulation
against an enemy attack.

488
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:53,698
But the truth of the matter is
that I'm just interested in...

489
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,367
<i>The Prncples of Modern Bankng...</i>

490
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,800
<i>Hstort of Pracy...</i>

491
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,136
<i>Pantngs of Orozco...</i>

492
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,831
<i>Modern French Theater...</i>

493
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:09,714
<i>The Jursprudental Factor</i>
<i>of Mafa Admnstraton...</i>

494
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,377
<i>Dseases of Horses</i>
<i>and novels of Joyce Cart, and...</i>

495
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,280
<i>Ethnc Choces of the Arabs.</i>
<i>Thngs lke that.</i>

496
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,795
- Ben?
- Yeah.

497
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,702
The army's got a lot of things
wrong with it...

498
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,694
but it does take care of its own people,
which is why I'm here.

499
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,176
As a public relations officer,
you're a disaster.

500
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,945
- I never wanted...
- Apparently, among otherthings...

501
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:45,516
you permitted the Secretary to make some
unfortunate remarks to that idiot Iselin...

502
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,320
- which started him off on a rampage.
- Mickey, listen to me, please.

503
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,023
For six months, I've been driven nearly mad
by a recurring dream...

504
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,358
The medical officer in charge...

505
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,596
What the hell does the Medical Corps
know about intelligence work, Milt?

506
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,698
I tell you,
there's something phony going on.

507
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,167
There's something phony about me,
Raymond Shaw...

508
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,870
about the whole Medal of Honor
business.

509
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,674
For instance, when the psychiatrist asked
me how I personally felt about Raymond...

510
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,411
and how the whole patrol felt about him,
did you hear what I said?

511
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,413
Did you really hear what I said?

512
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,715
I said, 'Raymond Shaw
is the kindest, warmest...

513
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,752
'bravest, most wonderful human
being I have ever known.'

514
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,788
And even now I feel that way,
this minute.

515
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,658
Yet, somewhere in the back of my mind,
something tells me it's not true.

516
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,455
It's just not true.

517
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,297
It isn't as if Raymond's hard to like.

518
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,424
He's impossible to like!

519
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,670
He's probably one of
the most repulsive human beings...

520
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,140
I've known in all of my life.

521
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,378
Ben, what I came to tell you is
Public Relations has sent you back to me.

522
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,541
And in your present state
there's no possible way I can use you.

523
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,119
As of this moment,
I'm placing you on indefinite sick leave.

524
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,782
Go away, Ben. Find yourself a girl.
Lie in the sun.

525
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,358
I absolutely refuse.

526
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,600
You don't seem to understand.

527
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,041
What I've just told you
is not a suggestion, Major.

528
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,838
It is an order.

529
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,514
Yes, sir.

530
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,477
Good night, Ben.

531
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,429
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all. Please do.

532
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,071
Maryland's a beautiful state.

533
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,773
- This is Delaware.
- I know.

534
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:34,378
I was one of the original Chinese workmen
who laid the track on this stretch.

535
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,815
But, nonetheless,
Maryland is a beautiful state.

536
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,113
So is Ohio, forthat matter.

537
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:46,017
I guess so. Columbus is
a tremendous football town.

538
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:52,262
- You in the railroad business?
- Not anymore.

539
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,065
However, if you will permit me
to point out...

540
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,301
when you ask that question,
you should say...

541
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,701
'Are you in the railroad line? '

542
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,606
Where's your home?

543
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,473
I'm in the army. I'm a Major.

544
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,483
I've been in the army most of my life.

545
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,246
We move a good deal.

546
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,556
I was born in New Hampshire.

547
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,354
I went to a girls' camp once
on Lake Francis.

548
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,059
That's pretty far north.

549
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,636
- What's your name?
- Euginie.

550
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:36,707
Pardon?

551
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,642
No kidding, I really mean it.

552
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,906
Crazy French pronunciation
and all.

553
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,573
- It's pretty.
- Thank you.

554
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,085
I guess yourfriends
call you Jennie?

555
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:51,155
Not yet, they haven't,
for which I am deeply grateful.

556
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:54,324
But you may call me Jennie.

557
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,258
What do yourfriends call you?

558
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,296
Rosie.

559
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,765
Why?

560
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,700
My full name is Eugenie Rose.

561
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,873
Of the two names,
I've always favored Rosie...

562
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,331
because it smells of brown soap
and beer.

563
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,980
Eugenie is somehow more fragile.

564
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,157
When I asked you what your name was,
you said it was Eugenie.

565
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,960
It's quite possible I was feeling
more or less fragile at that instant.

566
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:40,165
I could neverfigure out what that
phrase meant 'more or less.'

567
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,305
Are you Arabic?

568
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:54,451
My name is Ben. It's really Bennett.

569
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,687
I was named after Arnold Bennett.

570
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,890
- The writer?
- No. A lieutenant colonel.

571
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,859
He was my father's commanding officer
at the time.

572
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:07,987
- What's your last name?
- Marco.

573
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,632
Maj. Marco.

574
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,969
Are you Arabic?

575
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,376
Let me put it another way.

576
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,411
Are you married?

577
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:24,778
- No. You?
- No.

578
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,125
- What's your last name?
- Cheney.

579
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,061
I'm production assistant
for a man named Justin...

580
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,063
who had two hits last season.

581
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,032
I live on 54th Street...

582
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,835
a few doors from
the Modern Museum of Art...

583
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,430
of which I am a Tea-Privileges Member.
No cream.

584
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,843
I live at 53 West 54th Street.

585
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,045
Apartment 3 B.

586
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:56,774
Can you rememberthat?

587
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,754
Eldorado 59970.

588
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,754
Can you rememberthat?

589
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,530
Are you stationed in New York?

590
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,592
Or is stationed the right word?

591
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:30,147
I'm not exactly stationed in New York.
I was stationed in Washington.

592
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:35,586
But I got sick, and now I'm on leave
and I'm going to spend it in New York.

593
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:39,078
Eldorado 59970.

594
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,854
I'm going to look up an old friend of mine
who's a newspaper man.

595
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,001
We were in Korea together.

596
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,633
Mr. Shaw, there's a gentleman outside
to see you.

597
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,946
- A gentleman?
- An Oriental gentleman, sir.

598
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,141
He said he was in the army with you.

599
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,720
There were no Oriental gentlemen
in the army with me.

600
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,950
He is very insistent, sir.

601
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,292
All right, show him in.

602
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,680
I am Chunjin, Mr. Shaw, sir.

603
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,219
I was interpreter attached
to Charlie Company, 52nd Regiment.

604
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,021
Yes, I rememberyou.

605
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,956
You were the guide and interpreter
to the patrol.

606
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,763
What can I do foryou?

607
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:57,257
- What are you doing here?
- Yourfather did not say to you?

608
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,171
- My father?
- Yes. Sen. Iselin. I write to...

609
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:04,942
Sen. Iselin is not my father.

610
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,843
Repeat, he is not my father.

611
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:13,583
If you learn nothing else on your visit
to this country, memorize that fact.

612
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,186
I write to Sen. Iselin.

613
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:19,323
I tell him how I interpret
your outfit.

614
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:24,261
I tell him I want to come to America.
He get me visa.

615
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,096
Now I need job.

616
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,664
Ajob?

617
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,100
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

618
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,836
But, my dearfellow,
we don't need interpreters here.

619
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,038
We all speak the same language.

620
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,675
I am tailor and mender.
I am cook, I drive car.

621
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:43,547
I am cleaner and scrubber.
I fix anything. I take message.

622
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,777
I sleep at house of my cousin.

623
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,454
I ask for job with you...

624
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,515
because you are a great man
who saved my life.

625
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,032
I could use a valet, I think.

626
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:05,593
And I would like having a cook.
A good cook, I mean.

627
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,340
Very well,
you can live at your cousin's.

628
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,909
I will pay you $ 60 a week.

629
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,879
You will have every Thursday
and every other Sunday off.

630
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,416
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

631
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,485
I'm leaving for Washington
in a few minutes.

632
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,520
I'll be back here by 8:10 p.m.
I would like to have dinner waiting.

633
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,511
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

634
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:32,461
Just like United States Army.

635
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,961
Oh, God, I hope not.

636
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,138
You're going to be marvelous
in there this afternoon, hon...

637
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,106
ljust know you are.

638
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:55,352
There's just one thing, babe.

639
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,288
I'd be a lot happier if we could just
settle on the number...

640
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:02,486
of Communists I know there are
in the Defense Department.

641
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,764
I mean, the way you keep changing
the figures on me all the time...

642
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:12,102
it makes me look like
some kind of a nut, an idiot.

643
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,771
The boys were even starting
to kid me about it.

644
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:18,008
Just yesterday in the cloakroom,
they said, 'Hey, Johnny'...

645
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:23,708
You'll look like a fool if you
don't do what you're told.

646
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,819
Who are they writing about all over
this country, and what are they saying?

647
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,089
Are they saying, 'Are there any
Communists in the Defense Department? '

648
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,256
Of course not.
They're saying...

649
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,760
'How many Communists
are there in the Defense Department? '

650
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,362
So stop talking like an expert
all of a sudden...

651
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,229
and get out there and
say what you're supposed to say.

652
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,902
Come on, babe.

653
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,904
I'm sorry, hon.

654
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:52,568
Would it really make it easierforyou
if we settled on just one number?

655
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,083
Just one real simple number
that will be easy for me to remember.

656
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:16,366
There are exactly
<i>57</i> card-carrying members...

657
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:21,531
of the Communist Party in
the Department of Defense at this time.

658
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:26,008
Point of order, Mr. Speaker.

659
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,464
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

660
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,641
How did the old ladies
turn into Russians?

661
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,826
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

662
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:06,601
How did the old ladies turn into Russians?
What was Raymond doing with his hands?

663
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,045
What were you doing there?

664
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,781
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

665
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,181
What were you doing there?

666
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,810
It was original of you to have
the police department call so shyly...

667
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,801
and ask for ourfirst date.

668
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:49,615
They asked me who
I'd be willing to...

669
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:55,523
I know, and thank you.

670
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:27,157
I've got to find Raymond.
Maybe he's home by now.

671
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,592
All right, darling.
Whateveryou want.

672
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:32,529
But first,
I have something to tell you.

673
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,765
You know what I was doing
when you so cleverly had the police call?

674
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,601
Don't bothertrying to guess,
you're too tired.

675
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,637
I'll tell you what I was doing.

676
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:43,039
After I dropped you off...

677
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,276
I went straight home,
and when I got upstairs...

678
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:50,547
- Apartment 3 B.
- That's right. Very good.

679
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:54,745
Before I even took my coat off,
I telephoned my fianc.

680
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:00,623
I told you I wasn't married,
I never said I wasn't engaged.

681
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:05,261
Well, I called up my fianc,
and he came over as soon as he could...

682
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,596
which was instantly...

683
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,565
and I told him
I had just met you...

684
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,433
and I gave him his ring back.

685
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:16,139
I tried to convey my regrets for
whatever pain I might be causing him.

686
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:21,478
Just then, you had the police call to invite
me to meet you at the 24th Precinct.

687
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,414
So I grabbed my coat,
kissed my fianc on the cheek...

688
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,783
forthe last time in our lives
we would ever kiss...

689
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,114
and I ran.

690
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,923
At the police station, they told me you had
beaten up a very large Chinese gentleman.

691
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:37,527
Not Chinese, dear, Korean.
At least, I think he was Korean.

692
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:41,898
A large Korean gentleman, but that
you were a pretty solid type yourself...

693
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,667
according to Washington,
with whom they had checked.

694
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:45,668
So I figured...

695
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:49,439
if they'd botherto get a comment
on you from George Washington...

696
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,108
you must be somebody
very important indeed.

697
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:56,045
I must say, it was rather sweet of
the general, with you only a major.

698
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,808
I didn't even know you knew him.

699
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:04,988
If they were the tiniest bit puzzled
about you, they could have asked me.

700
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,657
Yes, indeed, my darling Ben...

701
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,260
they could have asked me...

702
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,387
and I would have told them.

703
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,307
- Hi, kid.
- What in the hell's going on?

704
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,910
They called me in Washington to tell me
you'd broken into my apartment...

705
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,105
and beaten up my houseboy.

706
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,488
Yeah, well, see, Chunjin, when I...

707
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,820
My God, you look terrible.
I've never seen you look so awful.

708
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,470
Raymond...

709
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:06,980
I want to tell you that I've been
having this terrible nightmare.

710
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,593
I've been in the army 19 years.

711
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,032
First time I've ever seen
one of these.

712
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,008
I've been having this nightmare...

713
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,935
a real swinger
of a nightmare, too.

714
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:41,718
It has to do with
all kinds of strange people.

715
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:45,021
Is it about a Russian general
and some Chinese...

716
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,421
and me and the men
who were on the patrol?

717
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,761
How did you know that?

718
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,389
Take your hands off me.

719
00:58:56,266 --> 00:59:01,203
Please, Raymond, tell me,
how did you know?

720
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,407
I don't really know
anything about it.

721
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:08,111
- But you just started to tell me...
- Do you remember Al Melvin?

722
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,046
- The corporal in the patrol?
- Yes, of course.

723
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,849
I had a letterfrom him
a couple of weeks ago.

724
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:16,219
Needless to say,
I was very surprised to hearfrom him.

725
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,055
You know how much
the guys in the outfit hated me.

726
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,190
Well, not as much as I hated them,
of course.

727
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,526
But anyway,
the funny thing was...

728
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:28,231
he said in his letterthat I was
the best friend he had in the army.

729
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,167
I was the best friend
he had in the army.

730
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,136
The poor, simple boob.

731
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,705
Anyway, he wanted to tell me
about his nightmare.

732
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,003
He said he was going out
of his mind.

733
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:43,446
Tell me what he said
about the nightmare.

734
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:46,916
He keeps dreaming that the patrol
is sitting in a hotel lobby...

735
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:51,087
and there are a lot of Chinese brass
and Russian generals...

736
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,356
Anyway, what's nightmarish
about that?

737
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:56,326
The letter?
Have you got the letter?

738
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,362
No, I don't.
I never keep letters.

739
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,698
That's all he wrote?
That was the end of it?

740
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,901
Why? Is it the same thing
you've been dreaming?

741
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,103
Do something for me, will you?

742
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,006
Call Eldorado 59970.

743
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,008
If a young lady answers...

744
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,044
tell her I've gone to Washington.
The town, not the general.

745
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,347
<i>I'll be n touch wth her</i>
<i>as quckly as I can.</i>

746
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,976
You'll do that, won't you?
Eldorado 59970.

747
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:31,027
To take some of the mystery out of it,
the photographs you're looking at...

748
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:36,399
are shots of male models,
Mexican circus performers...

749
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,935
Czech research chemists...

750
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,670
Japanese criminals...

751
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,672
French headwaiters...

752
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,376
Turkish wrestlers,
pastoral psychiatrists...

753
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,912
and, of course, various
officials of the USSR...

754
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,048
the People's Republic of China...

755
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,073
and the Soviet Army.

756
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,413
Hold the one on the right, please.

757
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,132
Hold this one, too.

758
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:23,446
Exactly one hour ago,
Mr. Alan Melvin, in Alaska...

759
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:26,142
made the same two photographs.

760
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,515
This one here wore sunglasses,
smelled like a goat.

761
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:38,528
His moustache was a little thinnerthen.
He had a loud voice, and it grated.

762
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,831
He's about 5-11,
on the heavy side.

763
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,197
Uniformed
as a lieutenant general.

764
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,905
His staff wore civilian clothes.
They looked a little like F.B.I. Men.

765
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,641
His name, incidentally, is Berezovo.

766
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,802
He's a member of
the Central Committee.

767
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:58,381
This one wore civilian clothes,
but his staff was uniformed...

768
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,818
varying from a full colonel
to a first lieutenant.

769
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,184
They wore political markings.
Lights.

770
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,548
Lights.

771
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:18,868
I'm going to recommend setting up
a joint-intelligence, C.I.A. F.B.I. Unit...

772
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:20,503
based out of New York.

773
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,206
You'll work with them,
representing the army.

774
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,242
- Your assignment's Raymond Shaw.
- Very good, Colonel.

775
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,811
It should be a very pleasant
assignment, Major...

776
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:32,381
considering that Raymond Shaw
is the kindest, bravest...

777
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:37,318
warmest, most wonderful human being
you've ever met in your life.

778
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:45,061
My mother, Ben, is a terrible woman.

779
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:48,360
Aterrible, terrible woman.

780
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:53,435
Chunjin.

781
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,671
Chunjin.

782
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:58,474
We would like some more wine.

783
01:02:58,474 --> 01:02:59,941
Chunjin.

784
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,279
Oh, I forgot.

785
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:07,583
Afteryou called,
I gave Chunjin the night off.

786
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,486
Because it was Christmas Eve,
I told him.

787
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,920
He was very reluctant to go.

788
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:17,949
That's probably because he's a Buddhist,
and he doesn't celebrate Christmas.

789
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,899
I don't think that Chunjin
is a Buddhist.

790
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,434
He smiles all the time.

791
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,870
What a shame.

792
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,372
I thought he was a Buddhist.

793
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:32,208
Otherwise I would have sent him
a Christmas card.

794
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,472
But I figured...

795
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:39,674
that if I sent him a card
at this time of the year...

796
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:46,055
then he would have to send me a card
on the Buddha's birthday.

797
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,057
- To save face, right?
- Right.

798
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:49,992
And that would have started
a whole big magilla.

799
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:55,589
Exactly.
You did exactly the right thing.

800
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:02,962
<i>Twelve Days of Chrstmas.</i>

801
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:07,874
One day of Christmas is loathsome enough.

802
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,746
What were we saying?
Oh, yes, my mother.

803
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:15,718
But you don't want to listen to me
talking about...

804
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:18,487
Of course I do.
I'm interested.

805
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:23,960
It's rather like listening to Orestes
gripe about Clytemnestra.

806
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,530
- Who?
- A couple of Greeks in a play.

807
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,656
You know, Ben...

808
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,969
it's a terrible thing
to hate your mother.

809
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:35,338
But I didn't always hate her.

810
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:39,604
When I was a child,
I only kind of disliked her.

811
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,507
But after what she did to
Jocie and me...

812
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,717
that's when I began to hate her.

813
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,752
Jocie?

814
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,447
Jocie Jordan.

815
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,018
Sen. Jordan's daughter.

816
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,887
That's pretty funny, isn't it?

817
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:04,431
Thomas Jordan's daughter...

818
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,895
and Johnny Iselin's stepson.

819
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:15,774
That's her.

820
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,440
Jocie.

821
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,487
- She's lovely.
- I always keep her picture.

822
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,824
Years later, I realized,
Ben, that...

823
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:38,501
I'm not very lovable.
No, don't contradict me.

824
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,569
I am not lovable.

825
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:44,607
Some people are lovable,
and other people are not lovable.

826
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,599
I am not lovable.

827
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,648
But I was very lovable
with Jocie.

828
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:57,753
You cannot believe
how lovable I was.

829
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,152
In a way.

830
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:03,919
Then, of course,
my motherfixed all that.

831
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:10,299
Ben, you don't blame me
for hating my mother, do you?

832
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,035
I'm not making excuses...

833
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:16,706
but I have been even less lovable...

834
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,039
than I was since.

835
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:27,116
It was the summer just before
I went into the army...

836
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,210
and I was bitten by this snake.

837
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:36,359
- Are you following me?
- I am.

838
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:40,663
While I was lying there,
absolutely helpless...

839
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,766
afraid to move, because
you're not supposed to move...

840
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:48,499
it makes the poison circulate...

841
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:55,511
when, unexpectedly,
there she was...

842
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,780
with a razorblade in her hand.

843
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,549
My daddy's going to be
so pleased about this.

844
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:04,487
I mean, he's absolutely scared about
snakes in this part of the country.

845
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:08,858
I know that sounds terribly Freudian,
but in this case, I don't think it is.

846
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:13,562
I think he's just simply and uncomplicatedly
afraid of snakes, period...

847
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:16,399
which is why I happen to be
riding around with a razorblade...

848
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,702
and a bottle of potassium
permanganate solution.

849
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,304
You don't happen to have
a handkerchief, do you?

850
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,329
No, of course, you don't.

851
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:29,278
I don't either.
I do have a Kleenex.

852
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:35,513
Seriously, Daddy is going to be
just thrilled about this.

853
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,588
All summer long,
he's been raving about snakes...

854
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,148
and nobody's even seen one,
and now this.

855
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:46,228
I promise you,
it may be uncomfortable foryou...

856
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,764
but it's going to absolutely
make his summer.

857
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,033
Now you just lie very still.
Don't move.

858
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,601
That's very important.

859
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,967
I'll be right back with the car
in a minute.

860
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,682
You're lucky,
young man, very lucky.

861
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:11,483
If I were to tell you the statistics
on death by snakebite every year...

862
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:17,748
But in this case, I think...
There's no swelling above or below.

863
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,370
Normal.

864
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,430
I must say, there's a good chance
you're going to live.

865
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,808
You are not, by any chance,
a mute, are you?

866
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,889
I want to thank you
very much, Miss...

867
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:50,459
- Jordan.
- Miss Jocelyn Jordan.

868
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,654
- How do you do?
- Hi.

869
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:58,200
And now, according to
the quaint local custom...

870
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,204
- it's yourturn to tell us what your name is.
- My name is Raymond Shaw, sir.

871
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,672
How do you do, Raymond?

872
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,641
Is your place near here?

873
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,711
Yes, it's that red house
just across the lake.

874
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,580
- The Iselin house?
- My house.

875
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,984
It was my father's.
My father's dead, he left it to me.

876
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,587
We were told that that was
the summer camp of Sen. Iselin.

877
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,190
Johnny stays there sometimes, sir.

878
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,990
When he gets too drunk for my mother
to allow him to be seen in Washington.

879
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:31,033
My dear, although we've done everything
that modern science recommends...

880
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:36,272
there's still the traditional folk remedy
against snakebite, which we haven't applied.

881
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,570
So, to be on the safe side...

882
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,744
- Mrs. Iselin is your mother?
- Yes, sir.

883
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,719
I once found it necessary
to sue your mother...

884
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,490
for defamation of character
and slander.

885
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,187
My name is Thomas Jordan.
Sen. Thomas Jordan.

886
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,889
The Communist?

887
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:07,469
One of your mother's
more endearing traits...

888
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:11,073
is hertendency to referto anyone
who disagrees with her about anything...

889
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:13,342
as a Communist.

890
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:17,680
The last time she so referred to me
on a network radio program...

891
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,810
it cost her $ 65,000
and court costs.

892
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,821
What hurt her more
than the money, I think...

893
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,690
was the fact that I donated it...

894
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:31,820
to an organization called
the American Civil Liberties Union.

895
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,625
- Sen. Jordan?
- Yes, Raymond.

896
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,502
I would very much like to ask
your permission to marry Jocelyn.

897
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,418
We were together every
minute afterthat.

898
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,729
You just cannot believe, Ben...

899
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,369
how lovable the whole
damn thing was.

900
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,575
All summer long, we were together.

901
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,337
I was lovable...

902
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,846
Jocie was lovable...

903
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,353
the Senator was lovable...

904
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,254
the days were lovable,
the nights were lovable...

905
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,189
and everybody was lovable.

906
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,659
Except, of course...

907
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,224
my mother.

908
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,677
What is it, Mother?

909
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,979
What sort of a greeting
is that at 3:30 a. M?

910
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,380
- It's 2:45 and what do you want?
- I want to talk to you, Raymond.

911
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,118
About what?

912
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:07,156
- About that Communist tart.
- Shut up with that.

913
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,092
Do you know what Jordan is?
Are you out to crucify me?

914
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,828
I don't know
what you're talking about.

915
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,159
I'm going to bed.

916
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:16,357
Raymond, sit down.

917
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,212
How would you see her?
They live in New York.

918
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,381
I'm getting a job in New York.

919
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,718
- You have your army service.
- Next spring.

920
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,982
I might be dead by next spring.

921
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,457
Raymond, if we were at war...

922
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:45,527
and you suddenly became infatuated
with the daughter of a Russian agent...

923
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,163
wouldn't you expect me
to come to you and object...

924
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:51,834
and beg you to stop the entire thing
before it was too late?

925
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,702
Well, we are at war.

926
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,437
It's a cold war...

927
01:12:55,437 --> 01:13:00,142
but it will get worse, until every
man, woman and child in this country...

928
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,177
will have to stand up
and be counted...

929
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,747
to say whetherthey are
on the side of right and freedom...

930
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:08,150
or on the side of
the Thomas Jordans of this country.

931
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,186
I will go with you to Washington,
tomorrow, if you like...

932
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:14,456
and I will show you proof
that this man stands for evil.

933
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,158
That he is evil.

934
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,596
And that his whole life is devoted to
undermining everything that you and I...

935
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,465
and Johnny
and every freedom-minded American...

936
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,228
She won, of course.

937
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,168
She always does.

938
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,963
I could never beat her.

939
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,140
I still can't.

940
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:41,281
I wrote a letter...

941
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,480
or she wrote it and I signed it,
I can't even remember which.

942
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:54,485
It was a terrible, vile,
disgusting letter.

943
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,635
The next day,
I enlisted in the army.

944
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,239
I never saw her again.

945
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,511
God knows, Ben...

946
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,711
I'm not lovable.

947
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,250
But I loved her.

948
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:24,452
I did love her.
I do love her.

949
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:37,099
Come on, kid.
Time foryou to call it a night.

950
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,480
So this lousy brother-in-law of mine,
I say to him...

951
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,950
'You think you're a poker player?
Well, I got a flash foryou.

952
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:50,510
You ain't no poker player.'

953
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,189
So I says to him

954
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:58,393
'My advice to you,
from the bottom of the heart...

955
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:00,418
don't play poker.

956
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:06,468
If I was you, I'd get myself
another line of action.

957
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:11,240
Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire? '

958
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,970
- So he says...
- Give me a deck of cards, please.

959
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,686
When I got married to my old lady,
I got no idea that this guy...

960
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:30,359
comes in the same package,
that it's a package deal.

961
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:35,831
For 11 long years,
I got this crumb tied around my neck.

962
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:42,070
- Believe me, it's no bargain.
- A beer, please.

963
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:45,307
Sorry I'm late, kid.
Got held up in traffic.

964
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,910
So I says to him,
'Do me a favor, will you?

965
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:53,115
'Why don't you go and take yourself
a cab and go up to Central Park...

966
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,777
'and go jump in the lake? '

967
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,456
Get out of there.

968
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,559
What are you doing?

969
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:50,932
Hi, Ben.

970
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:54,136
What the hell are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

971
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,626
I don't know.

972
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:01,371
I was next to you at the bar,
you were playing solitaire.

973
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,182
Then you bolted out of the bar,
took a cab to the park...

974
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,917
and jumped into the water.

975
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:11,186
I don't remember, Ben.

976
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,055
Ljust don't remember.

977
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,990
Wait a minute, I do.
I remember.

978
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:18,994
In the dream.

979
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:21,360
I remember what you were doing
with your hands.

980
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:26,465
You were... Of course.

981
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:33,308
Obviously, the solitaire game serves
as some kind of trigger mechanism.

982
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,401
Black <i>7 on the red 8.

983
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:42,818
I suggest we discard the various number
systems and concentrate on the face cards.

984
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,220
- Red 6 on the black <i>7.</i>
- Thanks a lot.

985
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,957
Because of their symbolic
identification with human beings.

986
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:53,962
Based on Raymond's psychiatric pattern,
we can safely eliminate jacks and kings.

987
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,465
Black 6 on the red <i>7.</i>

988
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,956
Why don't you try it for a while?

989
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,473
Human fish swimming at the bottom
of the ocean of atmosphere...

990
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:08,877
develop psychic injuries
as they collide with one another.

991
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,879
Most mortal of all...

992
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,848
are those gotten
from the parent fish.

993
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,684
Queen of Diamonds on the black king.

994
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,257
Hey, what are you doing?

995
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,522
- Cheating is a form of regression.
- I remember.

996
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:28,461
I remember.

997
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:35,036
I can see that Chinese cat
standing there smiling like Fu Manchu...

998
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:41,576
and saying, 'The Queen of Diamonds
is reminiscent in many ways...

999
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:44,704
'of Raymond's dearly loved
and hated mother... '

1000
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:50,485
'and is the second key
to clearthe mechanism... '

1001
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:53,318
'for any other assignment.'

1002
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:59,461
'... our great republic, repeat, republic... '

1003
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,230
'until the peril
of international Communism... '

1004
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,688
'is driven from every dark corner
of this great nation.'

1005
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,404
Give me a little chucky
underthe chin.

1006
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:12,307
I can't tell you how worried
I am about Raymond.

1007
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:17,212
- Raymond? What Raymond?
- Raymond Shaw. My son. Your stepson.

1008
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,015
I've been thinking about him,
and you know what I've decided?

1009
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:22,848
- What?
- I've decided it's time he got married.

1010
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:27,489
May I ask what you find
so amusing?

1011
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:31,560
Who could you possibly find
who would marry Raymond?

1012
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,930
I have devoted considerable thought
to the problem.

1013
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:38,733
It has occurred to me
that Tom Jordan's daughterJocelyn...

1014
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:39,868
you remember her, hon...

1015
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:44,105
that mousy little girl Raymond was so
attracted to that summer at the lake?

1016
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:47,404
- That little 'Communist tart'?
- All right!

1017
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,812
- I may have been hasty.
- A little in the hairline.

1018
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:55,016
Anyway, times change. I now think
she would make Raymond an excellent wife.

1019
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,619
She's been living in Paris
forthe past two years.

1020
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,721
I have word she'll be
coming home soon.

1021
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:04,226
When she does, I think we should
give a little party.

1022
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:07,062
But, babe, I thought
that you and Sen. Jordan...

1023
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:10,265
I keep telling you not to think.

1024
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,500
You're very, very good
at a great many things...

1025
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,271
but thinking, hon,
just simply isn't one of them.

1026
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:19,074
You just keep shouting, 'Point of order,'
into the television cameras...

1027
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:23,044
and I'll handle the rest.

1028
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:26,648
- I think a June wedding would be nice.
- Bourbon, water.

1029
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,515
Right before the convention.

1030
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:34,322
I don't know why yours is
the only apartment in New York City...

1031
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:35,690
without an air conditioner.

1032
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:39,127
Sometimes I think you came to us
from another century.

1033
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,463
Chu-chin-chow,
or whateveryour name is...

1034
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:44,132
the steaks are to be broiled
for exactly 11 minutes...

1035
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:49,638
no more, no less, on each side
in a preheated grill at 400 degrees.

1036
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,940
Yes, ma'am.

1037
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,642
Mother, may I ask a question?

1038
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,310
Of course.

1039
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,745
What are you doing here?

1040
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,180
Why are we having our annual meeting?

1041
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,316
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1042
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,019
When I got your message,
announcing you were coming...

1043
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,521
I naturally assumed
you wanted something.

1044
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:10,355
Not at all. This is a purely
social event. However...

1045
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,028
The 'however.'

1046
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:17,332
As you may or may not have heard,
Johnny and I are giving an enormous party.

1047
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:21,303
A costume ball, actually,
at the summer house on Long Island.

1048
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,498
I wondered if you'd like to attend?

1049
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,108
Have you gone out of your mind?

1050
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:32,447
The reason I ask is because we're giving it
in honor of an old friend of yours...

1051
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,949
and herfather.

1052
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,439
What old friend?

1053
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,788
Do you remember a darling girl we met
before you went into the army?

1054
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,891
Jocelyn Jordan,
Sen. Jordan's daughter?

1055
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:46,294
She's been living abroad
forthe last several years.

1056
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:49,331
She arrived back in New York
a week or so ago.

1057
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,832
And I thought...

1058
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:53,935
considering the rather shabby way
you treated her...

1059
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:58,804
it might be a rather gracious gesture
if I gave her a coming-home party.

1060
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:02,166
Jocie and herfather...

1061
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,381
coming to a party of yours?

1062
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:07,749
Of course...

1063
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,910
once I explained to her
you would be there.

1064
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,193
It's all right,
it's Polish caviar.

1065
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:23,288
Johnny, come over here, hon.

1066
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:31,799
You stand in the middle.

1067
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:37,203
- Thank you. See you later.
- You look marvelous.

1068
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:45,653
- Where is she? Have they come?
- They'll be here any minute.

1069
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,956
Are you sure they're coming, Mother?
Absolutely sure?

1070
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:49,858
Raymond, don't be such a jerk.

1071
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,528
Go and get yourself a drink
or a tranquilizer or something.

1072
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,830
Raymond can certainly be a royal pain.

1073
01:23:55,830 --> 01:24:00,435
She's just kidding.
You look great. Just great!

1074
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:03,836
What are you supposed to be,
one of those Dutch skaters?

1075
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:07,002
Raymond, darling...

1076
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:12,914
Why must you always look as if
your head's about to come to a point?

1077
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:17,442
Now just be patient, and she'll be here.
I guarantee it.

1078
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:23,091
Raymond, why don't we just sneak away
for a few minutes...

1079
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,958
and sit down somewhere quietly
and have a drink?

1080
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,431
Are you absolutely sure
she's coming, Mother?

1081
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:34,266
I told you, she telephoned me
minutes ago from the hotel.

1082
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:40,574
- Mother, how did she sound?
- Like a girl.

1083
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:48,437
Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire?

1084
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,993
Tom boy, so great you could come.

1085
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:02,097
I am here at this fascist rally...

1086
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,032
because my daughter has assured me...

1087
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:08,069
that it was important to her happiness
that I come.

1088
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,772
There is no other reason.

1089
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,364
Good old Tom.

1090
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:22,942
The time has come for us to have
a serious discussion.

1091
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,821
We feel... What is it?

1092
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,858
It's me, babe, Johnny.
Tom Jordan's here. I need you.

1093
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,626
I'll be right out!

1094
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,929
- Who's in there with you, anyway?
- Raymond!

1095
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,864
Hurry it up, will you?
We've got work to do out here.

1096
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:46,367
I'll take this one with me, dear.
It might be mischief if I leave it.

1097
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,837
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1098
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,501
I've been watching you through the window.

1099
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:17,205
When I saw you, my heart almost
shot out of my body.

1100
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:20,008
I sent Daddy around the front way.

1101
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,908
I had to see you alone.

1102
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:12,992
Come on, lover.

1103
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:19,834
Why don't you just take that somewhere
very quietly and drink it?

1104
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:23,463
All right, dear, run along.
The grownups have to talk.

1105
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,382
How good of you to come, Tom.

1106
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:37,485
I have explained to your husband
why I am here.

1107
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:43,091
I know you have strong personal
feelings about Johnny and I.

1108
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,494
What I would like to find out is
how strong they really are.

1109
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:48,663
To put it as simply as possible...

1110
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:51,933
If Johnny's name were put forward
at the convention next week...

1111
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,935
would you attempt to block him?

1112
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:55,637
You're joking, of course.

1113
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:59,007
Mr. Stevenson makes jokes. I do not.

1114
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:02,543
You're seriously trying
forthe nomination forJohnny?

1115
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:03,911
No. We couldn't make it.

1116
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:07,148
But I think he has a good chance
forthe second spot.

1117
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:09,951
I've answered your question,
but you haven't answered mine.

1118
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,182
- What question?
- Will you block us?

1119
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,957
Will I block you?

1120
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:23,655
I would spend every cent I own
and all I could borrow to block you.

1121
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:30,071
There are people who think of Johnny
as a clown and a buffoon.

1122
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,106
But I do not.

1123
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:34,309
I despise John Iselin...

1124
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:38,446
and everything that Iselinism
has come to stand for.

1125
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:41,949
I think if John Iselin
were a paid Soviet agent...

1126
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:45,749
he could not do more to harm this country
than he is doing now.

1127
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:49,891
You asked me a question...

1128
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:52,093
very well,
I'll answeryou.

1129
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:55,196
If you attempt to deal
with the delegates...

1130
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:58,800
or cause Johnny's name
to be brought forward on the ticket...

1131
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:04,806
or if in my canvass of the delegates
I find that you are acting...

1132
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,909
I will bring impeachment proceedings
against your husband...

1133
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:10,978
on the floor of the United
States Senate.

1134
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:13,715
And I will hit him, I promise you...

1135
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:18,379
with everything in my
well-documented book.

1136
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,744
For $ 1 million, pick a card.

1137
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:47,044
- Card tricks. If I had known that...
- Pick a card.

1138
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:52,749
The Queen of Diamonds.

1139
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,690
That's pretty good.
How did you do that?

1140
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:01,391
This is what is known, my dear girl,
as a forced deck.

1141
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:07,435
This deck of cards is often employed
by a professional magician...

1142
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:11,406
to simplify his problem of guessing the card
picked by the little old lady in the third row.

1143
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:15,076
Also employed by
Army Intelligence officers who...

1144
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:18,204
Rosie, let's get married.

1145
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:23,418
- We certainly are in good spirits. -Yes we are.

1146
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,952
Tomorrow's the big day.

1147
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:26,320
Lunch with Raymond...

1148
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,156
then a nice little game
of solitaire...

1149
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:31,319
and a nice long chat
about the good old days in Korea...

1150
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:36,097
and some old Chinese
and Russian friends of ours.

1151
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,362
Then a suggestion ortwo
to rip out all of the wiring...

1152
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:44,071
and then, dear girl, it's over.
All over.

1153
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:46,541
- What's the matter, don't you want to?
- Want to what?

1154
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:50,178
Get married. Why don't you pay
attention to me when I speak to you?

1155
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:55,116
Bennie, I want to marry you more than
I want to go on eating Italian food...

1156
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,584
which will give you some idea.

1157
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,456
Then why don't we get with it, kiddo?

1158
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:05,426
You know, arranging forthe papers,
forthe blood test, posting the banns...

1159
01:31:05,426 --> 01:31:07,562
figure out what we're gonna name the kids,
renting the rice...

1160
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:10,861
- buy the ring, call the folks.
- Folks?

1161
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:14,669
You neither? Orphan?

1162
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:19,240
I used to be convinced that I was the sole
survivor of a spaceship that overshot Mars.

1163
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,971
Very sexy stuff. Very, very sexy.

1164
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,459
- Ben!
- Hello, Raymond.

1165
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:42,964
Ben, I want you to meet Jocie.
Remember, I told you about her?

1166
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:45,099
This is my friend, Maj. Ben Marco.

1167
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:46,901
- Miss Jordan.
- How do you do, Major?

1168
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:51,105
Only, it's not Miss Jordan anymore.
It's Mrs. Shaw. Mrs. Raymond Shaw.

1169
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:55,676
We flew to Maryland last night.
We got married. We Just got back.

1170
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:58,312
Aren't you going to pop champagne,
or dance in the streets...

1171
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:00,781
- or at least kiss the bride?
- Congratulations.

1172
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:04,318
Ben, isn't she beautiful?

1173
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:07,522
Am I not the luckiest guy
in the whole world?

1174
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,925
You don't have to answerthat.
Anyway, I'm the one who's lucky.

1175
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:14,896
Listen, darling, there must be
some beer or champagne...

1176
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:17,965
or penicillin eye-drops
or some anchovies in the ice box.

1177
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:21,135
Crack open whatever it is.
The three of us have got to have a drink.

1178
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:23,738
Come on, bustle.
Make like a housewife.

1179
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:25,373
I'll get out of this idiot suit.

1180
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,142
Ben, you should've seen the judge's face.

1181
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:31,879
There we were, the Queen of Diamonds
and me looking like, I don't know...

1182
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,710
like Groucho Marx.

1183
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:37,385
Groucho Marx?

1184
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:40,721
Ben, ljust made a joke.

1185
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:43,424
Not a very good joke,
I admit, but a joke.

1186
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:46,093
Have you ever before
heard me make a joke?

1187
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:50,331
Ljust made one.
Groucho Marx.

1188
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,433
Big day! Mark that down in your book.

1189
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:55,459
Raymond Shaw got married,
and he made a joke.

1190
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,231
Groucho Marx.

1191
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:07,481
'The Queen of Diamonds? '
What did he mean?

1192
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:11,085
My costume. I came to this costume party
as the Queen of Diamonds.

1193
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:14,221
I didn't know what to wear.
Then I saw this big playing card in a shop.

1194
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:15,756
Mrs. Shaw.
Please, Major, Jocie.

1195
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,825
Please, Major, Jocie.

1196
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:19,627
You call me Jocie,
I'll call you Ben.

1197
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:22,221
Mrs. Shaw, Jocie...

1198
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,465
the reason I came here
this morning...

1199
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:27,802
is to ask Raymond to voluntarily
put himself under arrest.

1200
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:29,070
What?

1201
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:32,273
Maybe not under arrest,
that's pretty strong, but...

1202
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,575
to surrender himself
for some questioning.

1203
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:37,169
Questioning?
What kind of questioning?

1204
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:43,150
Raymond is sick, Mrs. Shaw,
in a kind of a special way.

1205
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:46,287
- He doesn't even realize it himself.
- Sick? He's not sick.

1206
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,589
He's the healthiest man I've seen
in my whole life.

1207
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:53,322
- You can tell that by just looking at him.
- That's not the kind of sick I mean.

1208
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:57,465
You're wrong, Ben.

1209
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:02,903
He's tied up inside, in a thousand knots,
I know that.

1210
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:05,633
But you can see foryourself
how he is with me.

1211
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:23,424
We were married just six hours ago.

1212
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:27,520
We've been in cars and offices
and airplanes ever since.

1213
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:32,824
What are your plans?

1214
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:37,204
There's an inn, The Bedford House,
near Bedford village...

1215
01:34:37,204 --> 01:34:39,206
it's about an hourfrom here.

1216
01:34:39,206 --> 01:34:41,776
There's hardly anyone there
this early in the season.

1217
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:43,710
We've already wired for a room.

1218
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:49,546
Ben, you've got to believe me and trust me,
I can make him well.

1219
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:56,190
I'll give you 48 hours. Have him
back here day aftertomorrow.

1220
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,782
I'll talk to him then.

1221
01:34:59,226 --> 01:35:00,887
Afterthat, we'll see.

1222
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:04,331
Thank you, Ben.

1223
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:05,992
Thank you, and God bless you.

1224
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:16,303
Darling.

1225
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:26,920
What?

1226
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:29,824
Nothing.

1227
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:31,724
Just darling.

1228
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:49,537
My dear girl...

1229
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:55,883
have you noticed the human race is divided
into two distinct and irreconcilable groups?

1230
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:59,920
Those who walk into rooms
and automatically turn television sets on...

1231
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,891
and those who walk into rooms
and automatically turn them off.

1232
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:08,295
The problem is they usually
marry each other, which causes...

1233
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:10,397
<i>... elopement of Jocelyn Jordan,</i>
<i>daughter of Sen. Thomas Jordan...</i>

1234
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:14,769
<i>and Korean war hero, Raymond Shaw,</i>
<i>stepson of Sen. John Iseln.</i>

1235
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,738
<i>- It appears however...</i>
- My Romeo.

1236
01:36:17,738 --> 01:36:20,474
<i>... ths Montague-Capulet note</i>
<i>wll have lttle effect on the feud...</i>

1237
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:22,243
<i>now ragng between</i>
<i>the two party leaders.</i>

1238
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:26,280
<i>From hs campagn headquarters,</i>
<i>Sen. Iseln stepped up hs charges...</i>

1239
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,350
<i>aganst the man</i>
<i>attemptng to block hs nomnaton.</i>

1240
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:33,320
<i>I now charge ths man, Thomas Jordan...</i>

1241
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,722
<i>wth hgh treason.</i>

1242
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:39,126
<i>And I assure you,</i>
<i>the moment the Senate reconvenes...</i>

1243
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:42,830
<i>I shall move for</i>
<i>ths man Jordan's mpeachment...</i>

1244
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:46,300
<i>and after that a cvl tral.</i>

1245
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,603
Come on, get dressed.
We're driving down to New York.

1246
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:51,372
Go straight to yourfather's house.

1247
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:53,874
Convey my personal apologies to him.
I'll join you later.

1248
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:55,501
What are you going to do?

1249
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,848
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

1250
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:05,717
I'm going to beat that vile, slandering,
son-of-a-numbskull to a bloody pulp!

1251
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:11,192
Mother!

1252
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:14,855
That vile, slandering husband of yours,
where is he?

1253
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:19,798
Something very important has come up.
There is something you have to do.

1254
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:40,617
Who is it?

1255
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,225
It's me, sir.

1256
01:37:44,225 --> 01:37:46,216
Raymond, my boy.

1257
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:52,032
Jocie waited up as long as she could.
She turned in about one hour.

1258
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:54,125
She told me the good news.

1259
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:59,006
I want to offer my congratulations
and welcome you to the family.

1260
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:01,675
I've been watching my daughter's face
all evening.

1261
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:04,745
- She's a very happy girl.
- Thank you, sir.

1262
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:07,715
Come with me.
I'll force some good whiskey on you...

1263
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:12,219
to celebrate your wedding,
soothe you after a trying day...

1264
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:15,956
There's some whiskey in that cabinet
beside you. Help yourself.

1265
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:20,995
I only hope you haven't been too much
upset by these idiotic attacks of Iselin's.

1266
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:25,232
Actually, I take the position
that any attack by Iselin is a great honor.

1267
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:29,669
Actually, I haven't had so much supporting
mail in the Senate in the last years.

1268
01:38:30,771 --> 01:38:33,467
I'm very glad to hearthat, sir.

1269
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:37,211
What the hell is that in your hand?

1270
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:39,546
It's a pistol, sir.

1271
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:41,446
Is that a silencer?

1272
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,715
Why are you carrying a pistol?

1273
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:48,855
What...

1274
01:38:58,198 --> 01:38:59,688
What...

1275
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:14,508
Ben, what is it?

1276
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:17,944
Raymond Shaw shot and killed his wife
early this morning.

1277
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:27,681
- But it doesn't say...
- I know.

1278
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:31,723
It wasn't Raymond that really did it.

1279
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,585
In a way, it was me.

1280
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:40,534
As you can well understand,
gentlemen...

1281
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:44,938
my wife is prostrate overthe loss
of this dear and wonderful girl...

1282
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:46,940
whom she loved as a daughter.

1283
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:49,943
And your stepson, Senator,
where is he?

1284
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:53,213
My son Raymond's in retreat...

1285
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:57,351
praying for strength
and understanding...

1286
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:59,842
to try and carry on somehow.

1287
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:06,984
Ben, it's foryou.

1288
01:41:13,967 --> 01:41:15,491
Maj. Marco speaking.

1289
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:22,741
How could anyone... Jocie.

1290
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:27,581
<i>How could t happen?</i>

1291
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:29,242
Where are you, Raymond?

1292
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:33,978
I think maybe I'm going crazy.

1293
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:39,026
<i>I'm havng terrble dreams</i>
<i>lke you used to have and...</i>

1294
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:43,725
Where are you? We can't talk on
the telephone. Just tell me where you are.

1295
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,163
I'm in a hotel room...

1296
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:51,832
across from the Garden.

1297
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:54,965
<i>Eghth Avenue sde.</i>

1298
01:41:56,143 --> 01:41:58,545
Room 4.

1299
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:01,648
All right. Listen to me. Wait there.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

1300
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:04,048
Don't move, just wait right there.

1301
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:07,454
Okay, I'll take him now.

1302
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:09,656
Everything's got to move quite normally.

1303
01:42:09,656 --> 01:42:13,490
I want him to feel like he's safe.
Just give me a pack of cards.

1304
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:20,193
They just handed the vice-presidential
nomination to that idiot Iselin.

1305
01:42:37,918 --> 01:42:39,249
Hi, kid.

1306
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:46,383
Who killed Jocie, Ben?

1307
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,189
Tell me, I've got to know.

1308
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:09,878
How about passing the time
by playing a little solitaire?

1309
01:43:20,127 --> 01:43:24,765
Now let's start unlocking a few doors.

1310
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:27,201
Let's begin with the patrol.

1311
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:31,338
You didn't save our lives ortake out
an enemy company or anything like that...

1312
01:43:31,338 --> 01:43:34,875
did you, Raymond?

1313
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,069
What happened?

1314
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:40,975
The patrol was taken
by a Russian airborne unit...

1315
01:43:42,015 --> 01:43:44,918
and flown by helicopter...

1316
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:48,479
across the Manchurian border
to a place called Tunghwa.

1317
01:43:50,157 --> 01:43:52,250
We were worked on forthree days...

1318
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:57,525
by a team of specialists
from the Pavlov Institute in Moscow.

1319
01:43:58,832 --> 01:44:03,537
They've developed a technique
for descent into the unconscious mind...

1320
01:44:03,537 --> 01:44:08,242
- part light-induced and part drug.
- Never mind all that now.

1321
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:11,411
Tell me what else happened at Tunghwa.

1322
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:13,709
We were drilled forthree days.

1323
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:18,652
We were made to memorize
the details of the imaginary action.

1324
01:44:18,652 --> 01:44:20,017
What else?

1325
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:29,129
And I strangled Ed Mavole...

1326
01:44:29,129 --> 01:44:31,495
and shot Bobby Lembeck.

1327
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:36,870
One red queen works pretty good.

1328
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:41,102
Let's see what we get with two of them.
Keep playing.

1329
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:58,019
Then I killed Mr. Gaines.

1330
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:02,696
It was just a test.
It didn't matter who I killed.

1331
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:05,666
They picked him to see
if the linkages worked...

1332
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:08,068
before they turned me over
to my American operator.

1333
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:11,401
And that business
about jumping in the lake...

1334
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:20,213
it really did happen.

1335
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:21,840
It was an accident.

1336
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:26,586
Something somebody said in the bar
accidentally triggered it.

1337
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:28,144
Keep playing.

1338
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:42,696
Then I killed Sen. Jordan.

1339
01:45:44,638 --> 01:45:46,606
And afterthat...

1340
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:53,747
You are to forget everything that
happened at the Senator's house.

1341
01:45:53,747 --> 01:45:58,446
Do you understand? You'll only
remember it when I tell you so.

1342
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:05,521
Now, Raymond, now the big one.

1343
01:46:06,827 --> 01:46:10,797
Why is all of this being done?

1344
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:13,265
What have they built you to do?

1345
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:16,329
I don't know.

1346
01:46:20,073 --> 01:46:23,610
I don't think anybody really
knows except...

1347
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:25,771
Berezovo in Moscow...

1348
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:29,507
and my American operator here.

1349
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:34,688
Whatever it is,
it's supposed to happen soon...

1350
01:46:34,688 --> 01:46:37,391
right at the convention.

1351
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,585
Maybe...

1352
01:46:40,427 --> 01:46:42,054
I don't know.

1353
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:48,532
They can make me do anything, Ben...

1354
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:51,093
can't they?

1355
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:54,441
Anything.

1356
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:56,710
We'll see, kid.

1357
01:46:56,710 --> 01:47:00,271
We'll see what they can do,
and we'll see what we can do.

1358
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,982
So the red queen is our baby.

1359
01:47:07,788 --> 01:47:09,915
Take a look at this, kid.

1360
01:47:12,526 --> 01:47:14,995
Fifty-two of them.

1361
01:47:14,995 --> 01:47:18,055
Take a good look at them, Raymond.

1362
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:20,133
And while you're looking, listen.

1363
01:47:20,133 --> 01:47:22,533
This is me, Marco, talking.

1364
01:47:23,804 --> 01:47:27,307
Fifty-two red queens and me are telling you.
You know what we're telling you?

1365
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:28,742
It's over.

1366
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:32,379
The links, their beautifully conditioned
links are smashed.

1367
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:35,282
They're smashed as of now,
because we say so.

1368
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:42,389
We're busting up the joint,
we're tearing out all the wires.

1369
01:47:42,389 --> 01:47:44,491
All the queen's horses
and queen's men...

1370
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:46,660
will never put old Raymond
back together again.

1371
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:50,430
You don't work anymore.
That's an order.

1372
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:53,233
Anybody invites you to
a game of solitaire...

1373
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:57,226
you tell them, 'Sorry, buster,
the ballgame is over.'

1374
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:26,765
It's time for my American operator
to give me the plan.

1375
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:34,199
Yes? Yes, I understand, Mother.

1376
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:45,785
She wants me to go.

1377
01:48:45,785 --> 01:48:49,055
There's a car waiting
for me downstairs.

1378
01:48:49,055 --> 01:48:53,287
The convention reconvenes at 9:00 p.m.
Forthe acceptance speeches.

1379
01:48:54,327 --> 01:48:56,955
I don't think anything
will happen until then.

1380
01:48:58,765 --> 01:49:01,700
- I'd better go now.
- Here is a number.

1381
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:12,369
I've got 500 people at my disposal,
a thousand if I need them.

1382
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:17,250
You call me at that number.
Try to call me by...

1383
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:21,414
or as soon as you find out
whatever it is they want you to do.

1384
01:49:29,663 --> 01:49:33,633
Remember, Raymond,
the wires have been pulled.

1385
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:36,436
They can't touch you anymore.

1386
01:49:36,436 --> 01:49:38,097
You're free.

1387
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:53,515
It's been decided that you will be
dressed as a priest...

1388
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:58,124
to help you get away
in the pandemonium afterwards.

1389
01:49:58,124 --> 01:50:01,027
Chunjin will give you a two-piece
Soviet Army sniper's rifle...

1390
01:50:01,027 --> 01:50:03,495
that fits nicely into a special bag.

1391
01:50:04,664 --> 01:50:07,292
There's a spotlight booth
that won't be in use.

1392
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:11,133
It's up underthe roof on the Eighth Avenue
side of the Garden.

1393
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:15,830
You will have absolutely clear,
protected shooting.

1394
01:50:21,414 --> 01:50:25,585
You are to shoot the presidential
nominee through the head...

1395
01:50:25,585 --> 01:50:29,289
and Johnny will rise gallantly
to his feet...

1396
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:32,892
and lift Ben Arthur's body
in his arms...

1397
01:50:32,892 --> 01:50:36,555
and stand in front of the microphones
and begin to speak.

1398
01:50:38,431 --> 01:50:40,767
The speech is short...

1399
01:50:40,767 --> 01:50:44,671
but it's the most rousing speech
I've ever read.

1400
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:48,368
It's been worked on here and in Russia,
on and off, for over eight years.

1401
01:50:49,509 --> 01:50:52,979
I shall force someone
to take the body away from him.

1402
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:56,716
Then Johnny will really hit those
microphones and those cameras...

1403
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:58,518
with blood all over him...

1404
01:50:58,518 --> 01:51:00,286
fighting off anyone who tries
to help him...

1405
01:51:00,286 --> 01:51:03,990
defending America,
even if it means his own death.

1406
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:07,527
Rallying a nation of television viewers
into hysteria...

1407
01:51:07,527 --> 01:51:09,396
to sweep us up into the White House...

1408
01:51:09,396 --> 01:51:13,594
with powers that will make martial law
seem like anarchy.

1409
01:51:14,634 --> 01:51:17,194
Now this is very important...

1410
01:51:18,571 --> 01:51:20,774
I want the nominee to be dead...

1411
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:24,711
about two minutes after
he begins his acceptance speech...

1412
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:27,514
depending on his reading time
under pressure.

1413
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:32,719
You are to hit him right at the point
that he finishes the phrase

1414
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:35,855
'Nor would I ask of any fellow
American... '

1415
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:37,957
'in defense of his freedom... '

1416
01:51:37,957 --> 01:51:42,595
'that which I would not
gladly give myself.'

1417
01:51:42,595 --> 01:51:46,031
'My life before my liberty.'

1418
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:49,927
Is that absolutely clear?

1419
01:51:54,808 --> 01:51:57,744
Would you repeat it for me, Raymond?

1420
01:51:57,744 --> 01:52:00,914
'Nor would I ask of any fellow American... '

1421
01:52:00,914 --> 01:52:04,017
'in defense of his freedom... '

1422
01:52:04,017 --> 01:52:06,586
'that which I would not
gladly give... '

1423
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:08,922
'myself.'

1424
01:52:08,922 --> 01:52:13,916
'My life before my liberty.'

1425
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:31,010
I know you will never entirely
comprehend this, Raymond...

1426
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:35,504
but you must believe
I did not know it would be you.

1427
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:39,986
I served them.
I fought forthem.

1428
01:52:39,986 --> 01:52:41,421
I'm on the point of
inning forthem...

1429
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:44,824
the greatest foothold
they will ever have in this country.

1430
01:52:44,824 --> 01:52:50,430
And they paid me back
by taking your soul away from you.

1431
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:53,266
I told them to build me
n assassin.

1432
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:58,438
I wanted a killerfrom a world
filled with killers, and they chose you...

1433
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:02,272
because they thought it would bind me
closerto them.

1434
01:53:05,712 --> 01:53:09,516
But now we have come
almost to the end.

1435
01:53:09,516 --> 01:53:12,085
One last step...

1436
01:53:12,085 --> 01:53:17,056
and when I take powerthey will be
pulled down and ground into dirt...

1437
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,524
for what they did to you...

1438
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:25,288
and what they did in so contemptuously
underestimating me.

1439
01:54:10,009 --> 01:54:14,912
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1440
01:55:17,844 --> 01:55:20,108
We need the lights. Lights.

1441
01:55:38,331 --> 01:55:41,459
Lights out.

1442
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,662
Why hasn't he called?

1443
01:56:09,662 --> 01:56:12,324
It was a calculated risk, Ben.
You were right to take it.

1444
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:15,926
Even if it's not true,
it's nice of you to say it.

1445
01:56:19,105 --> 01:56:21,733
- The Garden's filling up.
- Take it easy.

1446
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:25,834
- 8:44 a.m.
- I know.

1447
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:34,654
If Steinkamp doesn't take off
that stupid hat...

1448
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:37,123
and stop messing around with
those broads, I'll bust him into a PFC.

1449
01:56:37,123 --> 01:56:38,647
Easy, Ben.

1450
01:56:42,795 --> 01:56:45,787
Okay, Milt, I blew it!

1451
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:49,902
My magic is betterthan your magic.

1452
01:56:49,902 --> 01:56:53,106
I should've known better.
Intelligence Officer.

1453
01:56:53,106 --> 01:56:55,165
Stupidity Officer is better.

1454
01:56:56,709 --> 01:56:58,878
If the Pentagon wants to open up
a stupidity division...

1455
01:56:58,878 --> 01:57:00,869
they know who they can get
to lead it.

1456
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:10,356
Raymond was theirs, he is theirs,
and he'll always be theirs.

1457
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:13,621
There's time.
He may still call.

1458
01:57:18,231 --> 01:57:19,664
For money?

1459
01:57:25,938 --> 01:57:27,769
That's what I figured.

1460
01:57:32,578 --> 01:57:35,547
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- All right, Ben, let's go.

1461
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:10,710
You've got to stop this thing.

1462
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:13,112
How can I stop it?
On what evidence?

1463
01:59:13,112 --> 01:59:16,549
If there was a bomb here,
oryou got a tip there was, you'd stop it.

1464
01:59:16,549 --> 01:59:18,184
You'd empty the White House,
if you had to.

1465
01:59:18,184 --> 01:59:21,620
I say there's a time bomb here,
just waiting to go off.

1466
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:28,824
<i>Lades and gentlemen,</i>
<i>our natonal anthem.</i>

1467
01:59:49,582 --> 01:59:53,109
Raymond has never missed
with a rifle in his life.

1468
02:00:47,974 --> 02:00:50,204
We're in like Flynn, lover.

1469
02:01:10,696 --> 02:01:13,633
<i>- Lades and gentlemen...</i>
- Just take it easy.

1470
