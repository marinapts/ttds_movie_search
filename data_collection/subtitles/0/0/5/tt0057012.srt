1
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:46,196
For a year, rumors had circulated
among high-level Western leaders -

2
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:51,394
- that the Soviet Union was at work
on the "ultimate weapon".

3
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,796
A doomsday device.

4
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:58,005
Intelligence sources traced the
site of the top-secret project -

5
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:03,445
- to the foggy wasteland below the
Arctic peaks of the Zarkov islands.

6
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:08,726
What they were building, or why
they chose such a remote place, -

7
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:11,241
- no one could say.

8
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:38,516
- General Ripper, sir.
- Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

9
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:42,725
This is General Ripper.
Do you recognize my voice?

10
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:46,879
- I do, sir. Why do you ask?
- Why do you think I ask?

11
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:50,402
I don't know. We spoke
just a moment ago on the phone.

12
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:55,481
Would I ask if you recognized
my voice unless it was important?

13
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:58,956
- No.
- Let's try to stay on the ball.

14
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:02,482
Is the wing
holding at their fail-safe points?

15
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:05,319
Yes, the confirmation just came in.

16
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:09,035
Very well.
Listen to me carefully ...

17
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:13,757
The base is going on Condition Red.
I want it flashed to all sections.

18
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:16,998
Jolly good idea.
It keeps the men on their toes.

19
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:22,081
- I'm afraid this is no exercise.
- Not an exercise?

20
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:30,084
You have a right to know. It looks
like we're in a shooting war.

21
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:35,718
- Hell. Are the Russians involved?
- That's all I've been told.

22
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:40,482
My orders are to seal off this base,
and I mean to seal it tight.

23
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:46,755
I want you to transmit Plan R,
R for Robert, to the wing.

24
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:50,123
- R for Robert.
- Is it that bad?

25
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:54,564
- It looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir. R for Robert.

26
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:57,843
Last, and possibly most important:

27
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,919
I want all private radios impounded.

28
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:05,840
They might be used
to contact saboteurs.

29
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:12,764
The police will have a list of all
owners. I want them all collected.

30
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:17,317
After you've done that,
report back to me.

31
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:43,436
To guard against
surprise nuclear attack, -

32
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:50,762
- America keeps a fleet of B-52
bombers airborne 24 hours a day.

33
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:55,397
Each B-52 can deliver a
nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons, -

34
00:05:55,566 --> 00:06:00,321
- equal to 16 times the force
of all the bombs and shells -

35
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:04,963
- used by all the armies
in World War Two.

36
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:10,723
This force is deployed from the
Persian Gulf to the Arctic Ocean.

37
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:17,280
But they are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.

38
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:22,521
TOP SECRET
CODES

39
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:31,043
WING ATTACK PLAN R

40
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:37,243
Maj. Kong,
you'll think this is crazy, -

41
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:43,197
- but I just got a message from base
coded Wing Attack Plan R.

42
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:46,199
R for Romeo.

43
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:52,405
Goldy,
did you say Wing Attack Plan R?

44
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:57,481
Yes, sir.

45
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:03,835
Goldy, how many times have I said
I don't want no horsing around?

46
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:06,315
That's how it decodes.

47
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:12,641
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
heard through a set of earphones.

48
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:17,004
- You're sure it's today's code?
- Yes, sir.

49
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:21,842
There's got to be something wrong.
I'm coming back.

50
00:08:54,886 --> 00:09:00,882
- Get a confirmation from base.
- Yes, sir.

51
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:26,162
Is it possible it's a loyalty test,
to see who'd actually go?

52
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:30,399
Ain't nobody ever got the go-code.

53
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:38,723
We wouldn't get Plan R unless the
Russkies had clobbered Washington.

54
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:42,435
Maj. Kong,
message from base confirmed.

55
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:49,122
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

56
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:53,996
Nuclear combat,
toe to toe with the Russkies.

57
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:12,643
Boys, I ain't much of a hand
in making speeches.

58
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:18,438
But I got a fair idea something
doggone important is going on.

59
00:10:18,606 --> 00:10:25,205
I got a fair idea of the emotions
you fellas may be thinking.

60
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:32,238
You wouldn't be human if you didn't
have strong feelings on nuclear war.

61
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:40,165
But folks back home are counting
on you, and we won't let them down.

62
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:44,319
I'll tell you something else ...

63
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:49,037
If this thing is half as important
as I figure it might be, -

64
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:56,601
- you'll be in line for promotions
and citations when this is over.

65
00:10:56,766 --> 00:11:03,080
That goes for all of you, regardless
of your race, colour or creed.

66
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,556
Now we've got some flying to do!

67
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:24,157
- Buck, should I get it?
- You'll have to.

68
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:31,237
Hello ..?

69
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:35,763
Gen. Turgidson is here,
but he can't come to the phone.

70
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:39,043
This is his secretary, Miss Scott.

71
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:43,358
Freddy, how are you ..?
Fine, and you?

72
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:47,997
We were just catching up
on the general's paperwork.

73
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:53,604
He's tied up at the moment. I'm
afraid he can't come to the phone.

74
00:11:53,766 --> 00:11:58,078
Just a minute ...
General, a Col. Puntridge calling.

75
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:04,003
- Tell him to call back.
- Freddy, could you call him back?

76
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:09,638
- He says it can't wait.
- Find out what he wants.

77
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:13,594
The general is in the powder room.

78
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,839
Could you tell me
what it's about ..?

79
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:23,683
They monitored a transmission
about eight minutes ago.

80
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:30,640
It was directed to the
843rd Bomb Wing on airborne alert.

81
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:36,805
It decoded as Wing Attack Plan R.

82
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:42,199
Tell him to call what's his name ...
The base commander. Ripper.

83
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:47,804
The general suggests calling General
Ripper, the 843's base commander.

84
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:53,438
- All communications are dead.
- Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

85
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:59,044
Freddy, the general asks if you
can possibly try again yourself.

86
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:06,521
He's tried several times, but even
the normal phone lines are down.

87
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:15,636
Fred, what's it look like?

88
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:23,280
Are you sure it's Plan R?

89
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:29,963
What's cooking on the threat board?
Nothing at all?

90
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:34,356
I don't like the look of this, Fred.

91
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:38,883
All right,
give Elmo and Charlie a blast, -

92
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:42,595
- bump everything up
to Condition Red and stand by.

93
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:45,678
- What's up?
- Nothing ...

94
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:49,475
- Where are my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?

95
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:51,602
No place ...

96
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:55,964
I just thought I'd mosy over
to the War Room ...

97
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,562
- It's three in the morning!
- The Air Force never sleeps.

98
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:04,197
Buck, honey ...
I'm not sleepy, either.

99
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,679
I know how it is, baby.

100
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:13,920
I'll tell you what you do ...
You just start your countdown, -

101
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:18,796
- and old Buckie will be back
before you can say "blast-off".

102
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:23,964
Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.

103
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:30,838
And so I want to impress upon you
the need for extreme watchfulness.

104
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:35,045
The enemy may come individually
or in strength.

105
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:38,243
He may come in our uniform.

106
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:43,480
However he comes, we must stop him.
He must not enter this base.

107
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:48,805
I'm going to give you
three simple rules.

108
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:53,118
First, trust no one, whatever
his uniform or rank, -

109
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:56,323
- unless he is known to you.
Secondly ...

110
00:14:56,486 --> 00:15:03,915
Anything approaching the perimeter
is to be fired upon. Third ...

111
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:08,762
If in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

112
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,963
Better a few
accidental casualties -

113
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:16,005
- than to lose the entire base
through carelessness.

114
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:20,921
Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.

115
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:26,001
Now men, in conclusion,
I would like to say -

116
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:31,399
- that in the two years I have been
your commanding officer, -

117
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:38,119
- I always expected your best, and
you never gave me anything less.

118
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:47,035
The nation is counting on us, and
we won't let them down. Good luck.

119
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:19,523
Here's the attack profile, sir.

120
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:52,805
To ensure the enemy can't monitor or
plant false voice transmission, -

121
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:57,721
- the CRM 114 is to be switched in
to all receiver circuits.

122
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:03,563
The emergency prefix is to be set
on the dials of the CRM.

123
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:08,004
This will block all transmissions
not coded with a code prefix.

124
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:13,997
- Stand by to set code.
- Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

125
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,838
Set code prefix.

126
00:17:25,406 --> 00:17:28,159
- Code prefix set.
- Lock code prefix.

127
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:35,403
- Code prefix locked.
- Switch to CRM descriminators.

128
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:39,680
All circuits switched.

129
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:44,522
Check auto destruct circuits.

130
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:46,597
Auto destruct circuits checked.

131
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:56,122
Primary target:
ICBM complex at Laputa.

132
00:17:56,286 --> 00:18:02,236
Target reference: YGT360.

133
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:08,117
30-megaton nuclear device
fused for air-burst at 10,000 feet.

134
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:12,484
20-megaton nuclear device
will be used if first malfunctions.

135
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:15,206
Otherwise
proceed to secondary target:

136
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:19,757
Missile complex seven miles east
of Borshov. Target reference:

137
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:25,125
NBX108.

138
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:30,485
Fused air-burst at 12,000 feet.

139
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:45,120
Sir, something rather interesting
has cropped up.

140
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:49,325
Music. Civilian broadcasting.

141
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:53,684
I think the Pentagon
is testing our readiness.

142
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:58,556
They're going too far. We'll be
inside Russian radar in 20 minutes.

143
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:03,356
Listen. All the stations
are churning it out.

144
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:08,395
Mandrake, I thought
I ordered all radios impounded.

145
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:12,684
I was impounding this one
when I happened to switch it on.

146
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:20,321
With our boys in Russian radar in
20 minutes, I thought I'd tell you.

147
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:23,000
Group Captain ...

148
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:28,035
The officer exchange program does
not allow you to question my orders.

149
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:32,040
I realize that, but I thought
you'd be pleased to hear the news.

150
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:35,039
After all, let's face it ...

151
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:39,518
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we have to.

152
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:44,316
Please sit down ...
and turn that thing off.

153
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:49,082
What about the planes? Surely we'll
issue the recall code immediately.

154
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:56,561
The planes will not be recalled.
My attack orders stand.

155
00:19:56,726 --> 00:20:02,801
That is, to my way of thinking,
rather an odd way of looking at it.

156
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:08,916
If a Russian attack was in progress,
we'd not hear civilian broadcasting.

157
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:11,805
- Are you certain of that?
- I'm certain.

158
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:18,838
- And what if it were true?
- I'm still not with you, sir.

159
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:26,401
If an attack was not in progress,
your orders to the entire wing ...

160
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:37,922
I would say, sir, that something
was dreadfully wrong somewhere.

161
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,075
Take it easy ...

162
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:46,400
Make me a drink of grain alcohol and
rainwater, and help yourself.

163
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:58,559
Gen. Ripper, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force, -

164
00:20:58,726 --> 00:21:03,846
- it is my duty
to issue the recall code -

165
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:09,080
- on my own authority, and bring
back the wing. If you'll excuse me.

166
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:21,361
I must ask you for the key and the
recall code. Do you have them handy?

167
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:26,361
I told you to take it easy.
There's nothing anyone can do now.

168
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:32,237
- Only I know the three-letter code.
- Then I insist you give it to me.

169
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:43,759
Are you threatening an officer
with a gun?

170
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:49,960
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you -

171
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:55,405
- that while we're chatting here,
the President is making a decision -

172
00:21:55,566 --> 00:22:00,321
- with the Joint Chiefs
at the Pentagon.

173
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:06,721
When they realize they cannot
recall the wing, -

174
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:14,998
- there will be only one plan
open to them: Total commitment.

175
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:20,479
Do you recall what Clemenceau
once said about war?

176
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:24,605
I don't think I do, sir.

177
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:28,759
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

178
00:22:28,926 --> 00:22:34,956
When he said that, 50 years ago,
he might have been right.

179
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:40,723
But today, war is too important
to be left to politicians.

180
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:45,038
They have neither the time,
the training, -

181
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:48,755
- nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

182
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:57,123
I can no longer sit back
and allow Communist infiltration, -

183
00:22:57,286 --> 00:23:02,758
- Communist indoctrination,
Communist subversion -

184
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:06,805
- and the international
Communist conspiracy -

185
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:14,077
- to sap and impurify
all of our precious bodily fluids.

186
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:22,679
Mr. President, the
Secretary of State is in Vietnam -

187
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:26,395
- and the Secretary of Defense
is in Laos.

188
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:31,356
We can establish contact with them
if it's necessary.

189
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:34,359
Gen. Turgidson,
what's going on here?

190
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:38,240
Mr. President ...

191
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:43,639
About 35 minutes ago,
Gen. Jack Ripper, -

192
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:48,163
- the commanding general
of Burpelson Air Force Base, -

193
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:53,400
- issued an order to his 34 B-52's
which were airborne at the time, -

194
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:57,445
- as part of a special exercise
called Operation Dropkick.

195
00:23:57,606 --> 00:24:05,365
It appears he ordered the planes
to attack their targets in Russia.

196
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:12,921
The planes are armed with nuclear
weapons averaging 40 megatons.

197
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:18,683
The central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

198
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:21,918
The triangles
are their primary targets, -

199
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:25,761
- and the squares
are their secondary targets.

200
00:24:25,926 --> 00:24:31,683
The aircraft will penetrate
Russian radar cover in 25 minutes.

201
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:36,162
I find this difficult to understand.

202
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:41,116
I thought only I had the authority
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

203
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:46,240
That's right, sir. You are the
only person authorized to do so.

204
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:50,365
And though I hate to judge
before the facts are in, -

205
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:53,962
- it looks like Gen. Ripper
exceeded his authority.

206
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:58,881
Far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

207
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:04,074
Perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

208
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:08,842
Plan R is an emergency war plan, -

209
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:14,478
- in which a commander may retaliate
following a sneak attack.

210
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:20,642
If the normal chain of command has
been disrupted. You approved it.

211
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:28,799
You must recall the hastle regarding
our deterrent lacking credibility.

212
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:33,642
The idea was for Plan R to be
a retaliatory safeguard.

213
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:38,596
- A safeguard?
- The human element failed us ...

214
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:44,398
The idea was to deter Russia from
wiping out Washington and yourself.

215
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:50,516
So they couldn't escape retaliation
due to a lack of proper command.

216
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:55,123
The planes will return once
they reach their fail-safe points?

217
00:25:56,246 --> 00:26:02,560
No, they were at their fail-safe
points when the go-code was issued.

218
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:08,801
Once beyond fail-safe they continue
until they reach their targets.

219
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:11,844
Why haven't you countermanded
the go-code?

220
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:18,724
- We're unable to reach the planes.
- Why?

221
00:26:18,886 --> 00:26:21,116
As you may recall, -

222
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:28,966
- one of the provisions provides
that, once the go-code is given, -

223
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:37,682
- the radios are switched to a coded
device, designated CRM 114.

224
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:42,044
In order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake orders, -

225
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:45,915
- CRM is designed
not to receive at all.

226
00:26:46,086 --> 00:26:51,114
Unless the message is preceded by
the correct three-letter prefix.

227
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:56,639
Do you mean to tell me you are
unable to recall the aircraft?

228
00:26:56,806 --> 00:27:02,119
That's about right. We are plowing
through three-letter combinations.

229
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:07,838
But since there are
17,000 permutations ...

230
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:15,357
- When do we penetrate Russian radar?
- About 18 minutes.

231
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:21,601
- Are you in contact with Ripper?
- No, he sealed off the base.

232
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:29,275
- How did you get this information?
- He called after issuing the code.

233
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:34,804
I have a partial transcript
of that conversation ...

234
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:42,242
The duty officer asked Ripper to
confirm he had issued the go-code.

235
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:47,196
He said, "Yes. They're on their way,
and no one can bring them back."

236
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:52,599
"For our country's sake, I suggest
sending the rest of SAC after them."

237
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:57,920
"Otherwise we will be destroyed
by Red retaliation."

238
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:02,762
"My boys will give you a good start:
1,400 megatons."

239
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:06,123
"And you won't stop them now."

240
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:09,119
"So let's get going.
There's no other choice."

241
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:13,598
"God willing, we will prevail.
In peace, in freedom from fear, -

242
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:20,638
- and in true health, through
the purity of our natural ...

243
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:23,115
... fluids."

244
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:26,835
"God bless you all."

245
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,281
Then he hung up.

246
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:37,081
- We're working on that last phrase.
- The man's obviously a psychotic.

247
00:28:37,246 --> 00:28:42,036
I'd hold off judgement on a thing
like that until the facts are in.

248
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:46,677
Gen. Turgidson, when you instituted
the human reliability tests, -

249
00:28:46,846 --> 00:28:50,521
- you assured me such a thing
could never occur.

250
00:28:52,326 --> 00:28:58,845
It's not fair to condemn the whole
program because of one slip-up.

251
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:02,885
- I want to speak to Gen. Ripper.
- That's impossible.

252
00:29:03,046 --> 00:29:11,397
I'm no longer interested in your
estimates of what is possible.

253
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:16,321
Gen. Faceman, are there any
Army units stationed near Burpelson?

254
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:20,638
I'll just check, sir.

255
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:25,200
Hello ...

256
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:31,164
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

257
00:29:31,326 --> 00:29:36,320
Look, baby, I can't talk now.
My President needs me.

258
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:40,638
What do you think
about civil defense?

259
00:29:40,806 --> 00:29:46,403
Of course it isn't only physical.
I respect you as a human being.

260
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:50,605
Someday I'll make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

261
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:57,365
You go back to sleep. Buckie
will be there as soon as he can.

262
00:29:57,526 --> 00:30:01,678
Don't forget to say your prayers.

263
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:14,044
The 23rd Airborne Division
is stationed seven miles away.

264
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:20,395
I want them to locate Gen. Ripper
and put him in contact with me.

265
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:23,717
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. President ...

266
00:30:23,886 --> 00:30:29,518
If I may advise ... Under Condition
Red the base is sealed off -

267
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:36,797
- and defended by base troops.
They'd encounter heavy casualties.

268
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:43,201
With all due respect, my boys can
brush them aside without trouble.

269
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:48,679
There are one or two points
I'd like to make, if I may.

270
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,996
Go ahead, General.

271
00:30:52,406 --> 00:30:57,082
One: Our hopes of recalling
the 843rd Bomb Wing -

272
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:01,125
- are quickly being reduced
to a low probability.

273
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:07,077
Two: In 15 minutes the Russkies will
have radar contact with the planes.

274
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:12,639
Three: When they do, they'll go ape,
striking back with all they've got.

275
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:19,757
Four: If we've done nothing to limit
their retaliatory capability, -

276
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:23,396
- we will suffer annihilation.

277
00:31:26,246 --> 00:31:32,640
Five: If, on the other hand, -

278
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:40,998
- we launched an attack on all their
bases, we'd stand a good chance.

279
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:46,001
We have missile superiority. We can
send three missiles to each target -

280
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,761
- and still have a reserve force.

281
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:54,477
Six: An unofficial study, which we
undertook of this eventuality, -

282
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:59,515
- indicated that we would destroy
90% of their nuclear capabilities.

283
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:05,443
We'd prevail, suffering only modest
losses from their remaining force, -

284
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:09,440
- which would be badly damaged
and uncoordinated.

285
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:14,361
It is our policy never to
strike first with nuclear weapons.

286
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:18,963
Gen. Ripper has already
invalidated that policy.

287
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:23,244
That was not
an act of national policy.

288
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:27,115
Mr. President ...

289
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:32,235
We are approaching a moment of truth
for ourselves and our nation.

290
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:37,560
The truth is not always pleasant.
But it is necessary now to choose -

291
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:43,244
- between two regrettable but
distinguishable post-war scenarios:

292
00:32:43,406 --> 00:32:47,843
One with 20 million killed,
and one with 150 million killed.

293
00:32:48,006 --> 00:32:54,275
- You're talking about mass murder.
- I know we'll get our hair mussed.

294
00:32:54,446 --> 00:33:00,794
But no more than 10-20 million dead.
Tops! Depending on the breaks ...

295
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:04,800
I won't go down in history
as the next Hitler.

296
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:10,484
Are you more concerned with the
American people or with your image?

297
00:33:10,646 --> 00:33:15,481
General, I think I've heard
sufficient from you, thank you.

298
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:19,841
Mr. President, they have
the ambassador waiting upstairs.

299
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:25,364
- He's having a fit about the MP's.
- Have him brought in straight away.

300
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:28,439
Is that the Russian ambassador?

301
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:32,519
Yes, it is.

302
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:37,760
The Russian ambassador is to be
admitted entrance to the War Room?

303
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:40,565
He is here on my orders.

304
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:48,759
Are you aware of what a serious
breach of security that would be?

305
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:52,839
He'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

306
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:58,163
That is precisely the idea, General.

307
00:33:59,926 --> 00:34:03,396
Get Premier Kissoff on the hotline.

308
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:14,121
Survival kit contents check.

309
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:21,237
In it you'll find: A .45 automatic,
two boxes of ammunition.

310
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:24,603
Four days'
concentrated emergency rations.

311
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:31,956
One drug issue containing morphine,
vitamin pills, pep pills, -

312
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:35,675
- sleeping pills,
tranquilizer pills.

313
00:34:35,846 --> 00:34:40,522
One miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible.

314
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:45,555
$100 in rubles,
$100 in gold.

315
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:48,240
Nine packs of chewing gum.

316
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:54,242
A pack of condoms, three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings ...

317
00:34:54,446 --> 00:34:58,564
A fella could have a good weekend
in Vegas with all that.

318
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,763
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- No, sir.

319
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:10,396
If your eggs are fresh,
I'll have poached eggs.

320
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:16,044
- And bring me some Havana cigars.
- I'll see to it right away.

321
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:19,243
Try one of these Jamaican cigars.

322
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:25,117
Thank you, no. I don't support
the work of imperialist stooges.

323
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:31,998
Mr. President, are we going to
let that Commie punk vomit over us?

324
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:39,197
We haven't been able to reach
Premier Kissoff in the Kremlin.

325
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:44,357
Try B86543 Moscow.
He won't be at his office now.

326
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:48,963
Our Premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man.

327
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:54,075
- What did you say?
- I said he's a degenerate atheist!

328
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:57,682
I formally protest ...

329
00:35:57,846 --> 00:36:01,885
I think they're trying the number.

330
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:07,040
You Commie bully!

331
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:14,603
You can't fight in here.
This is the war room!

332
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:17,155
What is going on here?

333
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:21,285
This clumsy fool tried to frame me.

334
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:27,356
This lousy, Commie rat was
taking pictures of the big board!

335
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:30,237
Mr. Ambassador!

336
00:36:30,406 --> 00:36:34,319
This fool tried to plant
that camera on me.

337
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:37,159
That's a damn lie!

338
00:36:37,326 --> 00:36:41,365
I have never heard
of such behaviour in the War Room.

339
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:46,998
Mr. President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

340
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:17,074
- You got to hand it to the Commies.
- Those trucks look real to me.

341
00:37:17,246 --> 00:37:21,080
- I wonder where they got them from?
- They're probably war surplus.

342
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:29,077
Okay ... open up at 200 yards.

343
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:22,126
Tell him where you are and that you
are listening to the conversation.

344
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:27,246
Tell him where you are and that you
are listening to the conversation.

345
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:31,843
But please, don't tell him
any more than that ... Alexi.

346
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:36,164
- Please, I beg you.
- I don't have a phone.

347
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:40,000
Give him a phone.

348
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:09,884
I've done as you asked.
Be careful, I think he's drunk.

349
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:17,277
Hello ... Dimitri.

350
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:23,043
I can't hear you too well.
Could you turn the music down?

351
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:28,360
That's much better. Yes.

352
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:34,556
I can hear you now, Dimitri.
You're coming through fine.

353
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:38,878
I'm coming through fine, too? Good.

354
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:43,198
Then as you say,
we're both coming through fine.

355
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:46,881
It's good that you're fine
and I'm fine.

356
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:50,755
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

357
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:53,156
Now then, Dimitri ...

358
00:39:53,326 --> 00:40:01,165
You know how we've talked about
something going wrong with the bomb.

359
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:05,398
The bomb, Dimitri.

360
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:08,000
The hydrogen bomb.

361
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,999
Now what happened is ...

362
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:15,284
One of our base commanders
had a sort off ...

363
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:23,205
Well, he went a little funny
in the head. You know ... funny.

364
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:27,803
He went and did a silly thing.
I'll tell you what he did.

365
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:34,235
He ordered his planes ...
to attack your country.

366
00:40:34,406 --> 00:40:39,116
Let me finish, Dimitri.

367
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:42,596
How do you think I feel about it?

368
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:46,725
Can you imagine how I feel about it?

369
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:51,602
Why do you think I'm calling you?
Just to say hello?

370
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:56,601
Of course I like to speak to you.
Of course I like to say hello.

371
00:40:56,766 --> 00:41:02,762
But now I'm calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

372
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:05,599
Of course it's a friendly call.

373
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:09,685
If it wasn't friendly ...
you probably wouldn't have got it.

374
00:41:12,206 --> 00:41:19,521
They won't reach their targets for
at least an hour. I am positive.

375
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:24,720
I've been over this with
your ambassador. It is not a trick.

376
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:29,641
We'd like to give your air staff
a complete rundown of the targets -

377
00:41:29,806 --> 00:41:32,798
- and the flight plans
of the planes.

378
00:41:33,006 --> 00:41:37,796
If we're unable to recall them ...

379
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:41,515
... I'd say ...

380
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:45,964
... we're going to have to help you
destroy them.

381
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:48,686
I know they're our boys.

382
00:41:48,846 --> 00:41:52,839
All right, now who shall we call?

383
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:58,444
Who should we call?
Sorry, you faded away there.

384
00:41:58,606 --> 00:42:02,155
The People's
Central Air Defense Headquarters.

385
00:42:02,326 --> 00:42:07,559
Where is that, Dimitri?
In Omsk.

386
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:12,959
Yes ...
You'll call them first, will you?

387
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:17,603
Do you happen to have
the phone number on you?

388
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:21,515
I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

389
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:26,525
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

390
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:30,156
All right, you're sorrier than I am,
but I'm sorry as well.

391
00:42:32,686 --> 00:42:36,725
Don't say
that you're more sorry than I am.

392
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:41,357
I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

393
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:45,314
All right. Yes, he's right here.

394
00:42:45,486 --> 00:42:49,604
He wants to talk to you.
Just a second.

395
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:22,399
What? What is it?

396
00:43:22,606 --> 00:43:28,795
- The fools. The mad fools.
- What's happened?

397
00:43:28,966 --> 00:43:33,596
- The Doomsday Machine.
- What is that?

398
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:42,083
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

399
00:43:55,326 --> 00:44:02,402
Mandrake, have you ever seen
a Commie drink a glass of water?

400
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:07,805
No, I can't say I have, Jack.

401
00:44:07,966 --> 00:44:12,721
Vodka, that's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

402
00:44:12,886 --> 00:44:16,925
I believe that's what they drink.
Yes.

403
00:44:17,086 --> 00:44:23,685
A Commie will never drink water ...
and not without good reason.

404
00:44:25,286 --> 00:44:32,203
Yes ... I can't quite see
what you're getting at.

405
00:44:32,366 --> 00:44:36,644
Water. That's what I'm getting at.

406
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:41,436
Water is the source of all life.

407
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:45,002
Seven tenths of this earth's surface
is water.

408
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:52,595
Do you realize ...
that 70% of you is water?

409
00:44:52,766 --> 00:44:57,681
As human beings, you and I
need fresh, pure water -

410
00:44:57,846 --> 00:45:01,282
- to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

411
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:05,764
- Are you beginning to understand?
- Yes.

412
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,841
Mandrake ...

413
00:45:11,006 --> 00:45:17,115
Have you never wondered why I drink
only distilled water or rainwater?

414
00:45:17,286 --> 00:45:20,323
And only pure grain alcohol?

415
00:45:20,486 --> 00:45:24,445
It did occur to me, Jack, yes.

416
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:29,282
Have you ever heard of a thing
called fluoridation of water?

417
00:45:29,446 --> 00:45:33,121
Yes, I have heard of that.

418
00:45:33,326 --> 00:45:38,081
- Well, you know what it is?
- No, I don't know what it is.

419
00:45:38,286 --> 00:45:41,915
Do you realize that fluoridation -

420
00:45:42,086 --> 00:45:47,285
- is the most monstrously-conceived
Communist plot we've ever faced?

421
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:58,204
Two can play at that game, soldier.

422
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:03,239
That's nice shooting, soldier.

423
00:46:26,446 --> 00:46:30,439
- Mandrake, come here.
- Are you calling me, Jack?

424
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:34,201
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

425
00:46:34,366 --> 00:46:41,522
I ... haven't had much experience
with those sort of machines.

426
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:45,281
I only ever pressed a button
in my old spitfire.

427
00:46:45,486 --> 00:46:48,603
Come here and feed me this belt.

428
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:51,439
I'd love to come ...

429
00:46:51,606 --> 00:46:57,044
... but the string in my leg's gone.

430
00:46:57,206 --> 00:47:00,755
- The what?
- The string.

431
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:04,555
I've got a gammy leg.
Gone. Shot off.

432
00:47:06,566 --> 00:47:10,036
Come over here.
The Redcoats are coming.

433
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:15,916
It will produce
a mass of radioactive fallout.

434
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:20,716
In ten months the earth's surface
will be as dead as the moon.

435
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:23,320
That's ridiculous.

436
00:47:23,486 --> 00:47:27,035
Our studies show that
any fallout is safe after two weeks.

437
00:47:27,246 --> 00:47:31,034
You've obviously never heard
of cobalt chlorium G.

438
00:47:31,206 --> 00:47:35,836
It has a radioactive half-life
of 93 years.

439
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:41,359
If you take 50 H-bombs and jacket
them with cobalt chlorium G., -

440
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:45,963
- when they are exploded,
they will produce a doomsday shroud.

441
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:48,640
A cloud of radioactivity -

442
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:53,000
- will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

443
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:56,363
What a load of Commie bull!

444
00:47:57,406 --> 00:48:00,045
I'm afraid I don't understand.

445
00:48:00,206 --> 00:48:03,437
Is the Premier threatening
to explode this device?

446
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:08,879
No, the Doomsday Machine
will trigger itself automatically.

447
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:15,116
It is designed to explode if any
attempt is made to un-trigger it.

448
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:20,076
It's an obvious Commie trick.
We're wasting valuable time.

449
00:48:20,286 --> 00:48:24,518
- They're ready to clobber us.
- This is absolute madness.

450
00:48:24,686 --> 00:48:30,477
- Why should you build such a thing?
- It was the expense involved.

451
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:34,764
The arms race,
the space race, the peace race.

452
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:39,875
Our people grumbled for more
nylons and washing machines.

453
00:48:40,046 --> 00:48:45,598
Our doomsday scheme cost a fraction
of what we'd spend on defense.

454
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:51,955
When we heard you had similar plans,
we were afraid of a doomsday gap.

455
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:57,883
- I'd never have approved that.
- Our source was The New York Times.

456
00:48:58,046 --> 00:49:01,561
Dr. Strangelove,
do we have such a plan?

457
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:05,275
A moment please, Mr. President.

458
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:10,157
Under the authority granted me -

459
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:14,080
- as director of
Weapons Research and Development, -

460
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:18,239
- I commissioned, last year,
a study of this project.

461
00:49:18,406 --> 00:49:23,639
Based on the findings
of the Bland Corporation, -

462
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:28,721
- my conclusion was that this
was not a practical deterrent, -

463
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:32,595
- for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

464
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:35,917
Then it is possible
to build such a thing?

465
00:49:39,806 --> 00:49:44,641
The technology required
is easily within the means -

466
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:48,879
- of even the smallest
nuclear power.

467
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:53,557
It requires only the will to do so.

468
00:49:53,726 --> 00:49:59,756
How is it possible for this thing
to be impossible to un-trigger?

469
00:49:59,926 --> 00:50:05,478
It is not only possible,
it is essential.

470
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:09,924
That is the whole idea
of this machine.

471
00:50:10,086 --> 00:50:15,080
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy -

472
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:17,441
- the fear to attack.

473
00:50:17,686 --> 00:50:23,363
Because of the automated
decision-making process -

474
00:50:23,526 --> 00:50:26,438
- which rules out human meddling, -

475
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:32,078
- the Doomsday Machine is terrifying
and simple to understand.

476
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:35,841
It is completely credible.

477
00:50:36,006 --> 00:50:38,918
I wish we had one of those.

478
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:42,362
How can it be triggered?

479
00:50:42,526 --> 00:50:46,314
It's remarkably simple to do that.

480
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:51,958
When you merely wish to bury bombs,
there's no limit to the size.

481
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:58,156
After that, they are connected
to a gigantic complex of computers.

482
00:50:58,326 --> 00:51:03,764
A specific and clearly defined
set of circumstances, -

483
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:07,117
- under which
the bombs are to be exploded, -

484
00:51:07,326 --> 00:51:12,764
- is programmed
into a tape memory bank ...

485
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:18,000
Strangelove? What kind of a name
is that? That ain't no Kraut name.

486
00:51:18,206 --> 00:51:24,759
He changed it.
It used to be Merkwrdigliebe.

487
00:51:24,926 --> 00:51:27,565
A Kraut by any other name ...

488
00:51:29,406 --> 00:51:35,117
The whole point
of the Doomsday Machine is lost ...

489
00:51:35,286 --> 00:51:39,074
... if you keep it a secret.
Why didn't you tell the world?

490
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:43,762
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

491
00:51:43,926 --> 00:51:46,645
The Premier loves surprises.

492
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:52,601
PEACE IS OUR PROFESSION

493
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:36,883
Stay with me, Mandrake.

494
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:43,284
Feed me the belt.

495
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:16,236
Don't you think we'd be better off
away from all this flying glass?

496
00:53:16,446 --> 00:53:19,916
No, we're okay here.

497
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:24,796
In addition to flouridating water,
there are studies under way -

498
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:31,041
- to flouridate salt, flour,
fruit juices, soup, sugar, milk.

499
00:53:31,206 --> 00:53:35,916
Ice cream, Mandrake!
Children's ice cream.

500
00:53:36,086 --> 00:53:41,160
- You know when fluoridation began?
- No, I don't.

501
00:53:41,326 --> 00:53:43,715
1946!

502
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:49,518
How does that coincide with
your post-war Commie conspiracy?

503
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:53,804
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

504
00:53:53,966 --> 00:53:59,165
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids.

505
00:53:59,326 --> 00:54:02,443
Without our knowledge.

506
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:06,121
Certainly without any choice.

507
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:10,120
That's the way
your hard-core Commie works.

508
00:54:10,366 --> 00:54:13,756
Jack ... tell me ...

509
00:54:13,926 --> 00:54:19,000
When did you first become ...
develop this theory.

510
00:54:19,886 --> 00:54:22,195
Well, I ...

511
00:54:22,366 --> 00:54:25,802
I first became aware of it ...

512
00:54:25,966 --> 00:54:29,356
... during the physical act of love.

513
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:35,880
A profound sense of fatigue.
A feeling of emptiness followed.

514
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:41,035
Luckily I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

515
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:44,084
- A loss of essence.
- Yes.

516
00:54:44,246 --> 00:54:47,795
I can assure you
it has not recurred.

517
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:51,754
Women sense my power ...

518
00:54:51,926 --> 00:54:55,157
... and they seek the life essence.

519
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:58,443
I do not avoid women, Mandrake.

520
00:54:58,606 --> 00:55:01,040
But I do deny them my essence.

521
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:03,879
Yes ...

522
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:42,639
- My boys want to surrender.
- Well, there it is.

523
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:49,484
Listen, while there's still time,
let's recall the wing ...

524
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:55,676
Those boys were like my children.
Now they let me down.

525
00:55:55,846 --> 00:56:00,397
No, Jack, not a bit of it. I'm sure
they all gave it their very best.

526
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:05,276
I'm sure they all died
thinking of you ... Jack.

527
00:56:05,486 --> 00:56:10,116
Suppose a bit of water has gone off.
You can never be too sure.

528
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:15,918
But you look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

529
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:20,085
I drink a lot of water.
I'm what you might call a water man.

530
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:25,559
I can swear to you that there's
nothing wrong with my bodily fluids.

531
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:30,356
- Not a thing.
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?

532
00:56:30,526 --> 00:56:34,565
Time's running very ... What?

533
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:38,878
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?
- Yes, I was.

534
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:42,800
- Did they torture you?
- Yes, they did.

535
00:56:43,006 --> 00:56:46,476
I was tortured by the Japanese.
Not a pretty story.

536
00:56:46,686 --> 00:56:52,397
- What happened?
- It's difficult to think just now.

537
00:56:52,606 --> 00:56:57,999
What happened was,
they got me on the Rangoon railway.

538
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:02,199
I was laying train lines
for the Japanese puff-puffs.

539
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:06,962
When they tortured you,
did you talk?

540
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:09,441
No ...

541
00:57:09,606 --> 00:57:13,201
I don't think
they wanted me to talk, really.

542
00:57:13,406 --> 00:57:16,000
They were just having a bit of fun.

543
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,283
Strange that they make
such good cameras.

544
00:57:21,086 --> 00:57:26,479
Those clowns outside are gonna give
me a good going over for the code.

545
00:57:29,206 --> 00:57:32,676
You may have quite a point there.

546
00:57:33,566 --> 00:57:39,596
- Can I stand up to torture?
- No one ever knows.

547
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:43,679
My advice to you
is to give me the code now, -

548
00:57:43,846 --> 00:57:49,842
- and if they try any rough stuff,
we'll fight them together.

549
00:57:50,006 --> 00:57:55,876
You with your gun
and me feeding you the ammo.

550
00:57:56,046 --> 00:58:03,122
I happen to believe
in a life after this one.

551
00:58:03,326 --> 00:58:09,481
I know I'll have to answer for what
I've done ... and I think I can.

552
00:58:09,646 --> 00:58:12,877
Yes, of course you can.

553
00:58:13,046 --> 00:58:18,564
I'm a religious man myself, Jack.
I believe in all that sort of thing.

554
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:24,843
You've dropped your gun.
Let me take that for you.

555
00:58:25,006 --> 00:58:30,478
You know what? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code.

556
00:58:30,646 --> 00:58:35,481
Going to have a wash and brush up?
Always did wonders for a man, that.

557
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:41,039
Water on the back of the neck,
that's what we need, and the code.

558
00:58:41,246 --> 00:58:48,322
Supposing we play a guessing game.
I'll try and guess the code ...

559
00:59:03,246 --> 00:59:07,637
Co-pilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures.

560
00:59:07,806 --> 00:59:16,077
We have 109,000 total.
79,000 main and 30,000 auxiliary.

561
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:21,314
That works out to roughly
7 hours, 15 minutes endurance.

562
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:28,126
DSO to captain,
I have an unidentifed radar blip.

563
00:59:28,286 --> 00:59:31,801
Distance: 60 miles.

564
00:59:31,966 --> 00:59:34,958
Approximate speed: Mach 3.

565
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:39,079
Looks like a missile tracking us.

566
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:43,603
Confirmed. Definite missile track.
Commence evasive action right.

567
00:59:49,606 --> 00:59:53,155
Missile still closing range.

568
00:59:53,326 --> 00:59:57,080
Distance: 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

569
00:59:57,246 --> 01:00:03,162
- Lock VCM to target intercept mode.
- VCM locked.

570
01:00:03,326 --> 01:00:09,561
Missile still tracking and closing.
Continue evasive action.

571
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:16,564
Electronic guidance scrambler
to blue grid.

572
01:00:16,726 --> 01:00:21,800
Missile still closing distance.
Range: 30 miles.

573
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:28,038
Missile still closing.
Continue evasive action.

574
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:40,883
Range: 20 miles.
Missile still closing distance.

575
01:00:41,086 --> 01:00:45,762
- Range gate on maximum scan.
- Range gate on maximum scan.

576
01:00:45,926 --> 01:00:52,399
Range: 10 miles. Missile deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

577
01:00:52,606 --> 01:00:55,678
Deflection increasing.
Range: 8 miles.

578
01:00:55,846 --> 01:00:59,634
Deflection still increasing.
Range: 6 miles.

579
01:00:59,806 --> 01:01:02,161
Range: 4 miles.

580
01:01:07,646 --> 01:01:10,843
Range: 2 miles.

581
01:01:11,006 --> 01:01:15,045
Range: 1 mile.
Missile detonating!

582
01:01:19,646 --> 01:01:23,036
- Start lever to shut off.
- Shut off.

583
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:27,439
- Full engine power.
- Full power.

584
01:01:34,366 --> 01:01:38,405
Pre-select essential power.

585
01:01:49,966 --> 01:01:52,719
Hit emergency power.

586
01:01:53,806 --> 01:01:56,559
- Extinguishers.
- Roger.

587
01:02:03,126 --> 01:02:08,280
Transfer switches. Push flaps up.

588
01:02:19,646 --> 01:02:21,523
Full power.

589
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:36,080
Full power.

590
01:02:47,886 --> 01:02:51,959
Peace on Earth.
Peace on Earth.

591
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:56,836
Peace on Earth. P,O,E.

592
01:02:57,006 --> 01:03:03,195
Purity of essence. O,P,O,E.

593
01:03:13,886 --> 01:03:18,562
- Put you hands over your head.
- Who the devil are you?

594
01:03:18,726 --> 01:03:23,959
Put you hands over your head.
What kind of suit do you call that?

595
01:03:24,126 --> 01:03:28,358
This happens to be an RAF uniform.

596
01:03:28,526 --> 01:03:32,724
I am Group Captain Mandrake.
General Ripper's executive officer.

597
01:03:32,886 --> 01:03:36,879
- Where is General Ripper?
- He's dead in the bathroom.

598
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:41,437
- Where's the bathroom?
- Next to you.

599
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:56,723
Now stop playing games. I have to
contact SAC about the recall code.

600
01:03:56,926 --> 01:04:00,601
Put your hands over your head
and keep them there.

601
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:04,042
- Got any witnesses?
- What? He shot himself.

602
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:11,157
- While he was shaving?
- Look, Colonel "Bat" Guano ...

603
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:18,437
I have a very good idea, I hope,
I pray, of what the recall code is.

604
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:23,634
It's some sort of recurrent theme.
Peace on Earth or purity of essence.

605
01:04:23,806 --> 01:04:27,879
Put your hands on top of your head.
Start walking.

606
01:04:28,086 --> 01:04:34,639
General Ripper went mad and sent
the whole wing to attack the Soviets?

607
01:04:34,846 --> 01:04:38,077
- What are you talking about?
- I'll tell you.

608
01:04:38,246 --> 01:04:42,034
This red telephone
is connected to SAC ...

609
01:04:42,206 --> 01:04:46,358
... and I hope ... Blast!

610
01:04:46,526 --> 01:04:52,078
Shot away by one of your men
during this ridiculous fighting.

611
01:04:52,246 --> 01:04:54,202
Right!

612
01:04:54,366 --> 01:04:57,563
I've wasted too much time on you.

613
01:04:57,726 --> 01:05:01,116
I've got wounded men outside.
Start walking.

614
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:26,479
All the radio gear is out,
including the CRM 114.

615
01:05:26,686 --> 01:05:29,280
The auto-destruct mechanism blew up.

616
01:05:33,646 --> 01:05:40,165
The fire is out.
Emergency power is on.

617
01:05:40,326 --> 01:05:41,918
Navigator.

618
01:05:42,086 --> 01:05:47,240
Our rate of fuel loss
is approximately 162 per minute.

619
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:52,275
This gives sufficient range to take
our primary and secondary targets.

620
01:05:52,446 --> 01:05:57,395
But we will not be able to make it
back to any base or neutral country.

621
01:05:57,566 --> 01:06:03,323
However, we'd have enough fuel to
ditch at weather ship Tango Delta.

622
01:06:03,486 --> 01:06:06,558
Grid coordinates: 003,691.

623
01:06:11,206 --> 01:06:17,202
We've got three engines out and more
holes than a horse trader's mule.

624
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:22,645
The radio's gone
and we're leaking fuel.

625
01:06:22,806 --> 01:06:25,604
But we've got one advantage:

626
01:06:25,766 --> 01:06:30,442
At this height they may harpoon us,
but they can't get us on any radar.

627
01:06:41,406 --> 01:06:46,036
- Where are you taking me?
- The main gate.

628
01:06:46,206 --> 01:06:50,961
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here!

629
01:06:51,126 --> 01:06:55,483
You know what I think?
I think you're a deviated pervert.

630
01:06:55,646 --> 01:07:01,994
I think Gen. Ripper found out
about your pervertion. Now move!

631
01:07:02,846 --> 01:07:06,156
I don't know about
any planes attacking Russia.

632
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:11,525
I was told to get Gen. Ripper
on the phone to the President.

633
01:07:11,686 --> 01:07:16,555
- You just said the President.
- What about the President?

634
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:22,159
He wants to speak to Gen. Ripper,
and Gen. Ripper is dead, is he not?

635
01:07:22,366 --> 01:07:27,156
As Gen. Ripper's executive officer,
the President must speak to me.

636
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:30,921
That telephone line may be open.

637
01:07:31,086 --> 01:07:36,399
- You want to talk to the President?
- I've got to.

638
01:07:36,606 --> 01:07:39,996
If you don't put that gun away, -

639
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:44,125
- the court of enquiry on this
will give such a pranging, -

640
01:07:44,286 --> 01:07:47,995
- you'll be lucky to be wearing
the uniform of a toilet attendant!

641
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:57,159
Go ahead. Try and get the President
of the United States on the phone.

642
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:03,204
You try any pervertions
and I'll blow your head off.

643
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:19,397
This is Group Captain Mandrake
at Burpelson Air Force Base.

644
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:23,320
Something urgent has come up
and I want to place a call -

645
01:08:23,486 --> 01:08:26,205
- with the President in Washington.

646
01:08:27,726 --> 01:08:30,718
Burpelson 39180.

647
01:08:32,086 --> 01:08:37,399
I'm perfectly serious.
The President of the United States.

648
01:08:37,566 --> 01:08:42,924
I haven't got enough change.
Could you make this a collect call?

649
01:08:54,566 --> 01:08:59,765
Just one second, operator.
Have you got 55 cents?

650
01:08:59,926 --> 01:09:04,954
Do you think I'd go into combat
with loose change in my pocket?

651
01:09:05,126 --> 01:09:11,315
Operator, is it possible
to make this an ordinary trunk call?

652
01:09:11,486 --> 01:09:17,482
What do you call it?
You know ... station to station.

653
01:09:20,846 --> 01:09:24,077
Blast! I'm still 20 cents short.

654
01:09:25,886 --> 01:09:29,162
Hold on. I shan't keep you a second.

655
01:09:29,326 --> 01:09:33,319
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
Shoot the lock off it.

656
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:39,959
- There may be some change in there.
- That's private property.

657
01:09:40,126 --> 01:09:45,678
Can you imagine
what's going to happen to you -

658
01:09:45,846 --> 01:09:50,124
- when they learn that you have
obstructed a call to the President?

659
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,961
Can you imagine? Shoot it off!

660
01:09:54,126 --> 01:09:57,596
With a gun!
That's what the bullets are for!

661
01:09:57,766 --> 01:10:00,963
Okay, I'll get your money for you.

662
01:10:01,126 --> 01:10:04,880
But if you don't get
the President on that phone ...

663
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:09,517
... you'll have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

664
01:10:17,286 --> 01:10:17,406
This is SAC Communications Control.

665
01:10:17,406 --> 01:10:20,239
This is SAC Communications Control.

666
01:10:20,446 --> 01:10:25,520
The recall code O,P,E,
is being acknowledged -

667
01:10:25,726 --> 01:10:30,277
- by elements of the 843 Bomb Wing.

668
01:10:30,446 --> 01:10:36,840
These are the details.
Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38 -

669
01:10:37,006 --> 01:10:40,203
- are reported destroyed
by enemy action.

670
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:44,882
All other missions
have acknowledged recall code.

671
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:48,277
SAC Communications Control,
over and out.

672
01:10:48,446 --> 01:10:50,641
Gentlemen!

673
01:10:50,806 --> 01:10:54,515
Gentlemen ... Mr. President.

674
01:10:54,686 --> 01:10:59,760
I'm not a sentimentalist, but I know
what's in every heart in this room.

675
01:10:59,926 --> 01:11:05,523
I think we should all bow our heads
and give a short prayer of thanks.

676
01:11:05,686 --> 01:11:08,246
Lord ..!

677
01:11:08,446 --> 01:11:12,598
We have heard
the wings of the angel of death -

678
01:11:12,766 --> 01:11:17,886
- fluttering over our heads.
You have delivered us from evil ...

679
01:11:18,046 --> 01:11:22,562
Excuse me, sir. Premier Kissoff's
calling and he's hopping mad.

680
01:11:29,086 --> 01:11:32,874
Fuel leakage from active engines
has increased.

681
01:11:33,046 --> 01:11:38,040
It now works out at 205.

682
01:11:38,206 --> 01:11:43,234
Estimate remaining fuel at 8790.

683
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,354
Roger, confirm.

684
01:11:49,526 --> 01:11:54,395
205 per minute
and remaining fuel 8790.

685
01:12:00,606 --> 01:12:04,645
No, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

686
01:12:04,806 --> 01:12:10,722
No, I'm certain of that.
I'm perfectly certain of that.

687
01:12:10,886 --> 01:12:15,755
Just a second. He says that one
of the planes hasn't turned back.

688
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:21,199
He says that it's headed
for the missile complex at Laputa.

689
01:12:25,366 --> 01:12:29,120
That's impossible, Mr. President ...
Look at the big board.

690
01:12:29,286 --> 01:12:34,918
34 planes. 30 recalls acknowledged.
4 splashes, one of which was Laputa.

691
01:12:37,726 --> 01:12:43,995
We've recalled every plane
except the four you've shot down.

692
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:47,715
Oh!

693
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:53,364
Hang on a second, Dimitri.

694
01:12:53,526 --> 01:13:01,240
They claim three aircraft confirmed.
The fourth may only be damaged.

695
01:13:01,406 --> 01:13:07,117
Mr. President ... I'm beginning
to smell a big, fat Commie rat.

696
01:13:07,286 --> 01:13:13,600
Suppose Kissoff is lying,
that he's looking to clobber us ...

697
01:13:17,886 --> 01:13:23,597
If the report is true, and the plane
manages to bomb the target, -

698
01:13:23,806 --> 01:13:27,765
- is this going to set off
the Doomsday Machine?

699
01:13:30,966 --> 01:13:34,003
Are you sure?

700
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:39,121
I guess you're just going to
have to get that plane, Dimitri.

701
01:13:39,326 --> 01:13:46,676
Jamming your radar and flying low
is what they're trained to do.

702
01:13:46,846 --> 01:13:52,716
I'm sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane.

703
01:13:55,006 --> 01:14:01,479
It won't help either one of us
if the Doomsday Machine goes off.

704
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:06,674
There's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this.

705
01:14:06,846 --> 01:14:11,044
Keep your feet on the ground.

706
01:14:11,206 --> 01:14:17,202
I'm not ...
I'm just worried, that's all.

707
01:14:17,406 --> 01:14:22,719
Its primary target is Laputa
and its secondary target is Borkov.

708
01:14:22,886 --> 01:14:25,559
It's true, you've got to believe it.

709
01:14:25,726 --> 01:14:29,321
Can I give you just one word ...

710
01:14:29,486 --> 01:14:32,523
... one word of advice?

711
01:14:32,686 --> 01:14:37,635
Put everything you've got into those
two sectors and you can't miss.

712
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:47,559
If we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate, -

713
01:14:47,726 --> 01:14:53,642
- the remaining 38 minutes will
not even take us to the primary.

714
01:14:53,806 --> 01:14:57,481
You said we'd get to the primary!

715
01:14:57,646 --> 01:15:03,118
That estimate was based
on the original loss-rate factor.

716
01:15:03,286 --> 01:15:07,438
You just get me to the primary,
do you hear?

717
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:14,000
I'm sorry, those are the figures.
We have to reach that weather ship.

718
01:15:14,206 --> 01:15:16,276
Shoot!

719
01:15:16,446 --> 01:15:20,439
We ain't come this far
to dump this thing in the drink.

720
01:15:20,606 --> 01:15:22,358
New target.

721
01:15:30,886 --> 01:15:37,200
At this rate of loss we have
a chance to reach target 384.

722
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:45,558
Grid coordinates: 003,691.
We could then make the weather ship.

723
01:15:45,726 --> 01:15:51,596
- What kind a of target is that?
- It's an ICBM complex.

724
01:15:51,766 --> 01:16:00,162
All right, designated target 384.
Get me a rough heading on that.

725
01:16:11,686 --> 01:16:16,521
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
We're all in this together.

726
01:16:16,686 --> 01:16:20,201
We're with you all the way.

727
01:16:20,366 --> 01:16:23,756
Yes, we'll keep the line open.

728
01:16:23,966 --> 01:16:27,276
All right, Dimitri.

729
01:16:28,206 --> 01:16:33,724
Is there really a chance
for that plane to get through?

730
01:16:33,886 --> 01:16:36,195
If I may speak freely ...

731
01:16:36,366 --> 01:16:39,676
The Russkie talks big,
but he's short of know-how.

732
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:44,237
Ignorant peons can't understand
machines like we can.

733
01:16:44,446 --> 01:16:48,803
And that's not meant as an insult.
We know the Russkies got guts.

734
01:16:48,966 --> 01:16:51,924
Look at how they fought the Nazis.

735
01:16:52,086 --> 01:16:56,398
- Can't you stick to the point?
- Well, sir ...

736
01:16:56,566 --> 01:16:59,717
If the pilot's good, real sharp ...

737
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:03,561
He can barrel that baby in.
You ought to see it.

738
01:17:03,726 --> 01:17:09,084
A big plane like a 52.
Frying chickens in a barnyard.

739
01:17:09,246 --> 01:17:14,479
- But has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance? Hell yes!

740
01:17:37,926 --> 01:17:43,762
Approaching target.
Distance: 10 miles.

741
01:17:43,966 --> 01:17:46,958
Switch from green grid
to target orange.

742
01:17:47,206 --> 01:17:51,484
Ready for final bomb-run check.
Take over, ace.

743
01:17:56,646 --> 01:17:59,035
- DSO ready.
- Bombardier ready.

744
01:17:59,206 --> 01:18:04,155
Bomb fusing on. Electronic,
barometric, time and impact.

745
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:09,605
Bomb fusing is on. Electronic,
barometric, time and impact.

746
01:18:09,766 --> 01:18:15,602
Fuse for ground burst.
Delay factor yellow three.

747
01:18:15,766 --> 01:18:22,001
Bomb-fusing circuits
one through four. Test.

748
01:18:22,206 --> 01:18:27,599
Bomb-arming test-lights on,
one through four.

749
01:18:27,766 --> 01:18:33,284
Engage
primary trigger-switch override.

750
01:18:33,446 --> 01:18:38,281
Track indicators
to maximum deflection.

751
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:43,998
Set detonator to zero altitude.

752
01:18:44,206 --> 01:18:48,245
Release first safety.

753
01:18:49,846 --> 01:18:54,237
First safety released.

754
01:18:54,406 --> 01:18:58,797
Release second safety.

755
01:18:59,926 --> 01:19:03,521
Second safety released.

756
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:16,716
Check bomb-door circuits
one through four.

757
01:19:20,606 --> 01:19:23,404
CLOSED

758
01:19:25,086 --> 01:19:28,442
Bomb door circuits
negative function.

759
01:19:28,606 --> 01:19:32,076
- Lights red.
- Switch in back-up circuits.

760
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:37,559
- Still negative function.
- Engage emergency power.

761
01:19:37,726 --> 01:19:42,277
Emergency power on.
Still negative function.

762
01:19:44,206 --> 01:19:49,121
- Operate manual override.
- Roger.

763
01:19:58,566 --> 01:20:03,435
Still negative function.
The drive cable must be sheered.

764
01:20:03,606 --> 01:20:07,440
- Fire the explosive bolts!
- Roger.

765
01:20:19,726 --> 01:20:24,959
Still negative, sir.
The operating circuits are dead.

766
01:20:30,286 --> 01:20:33,915
Stay on the bomb run, ace.
I'm going down below.

767
01:20:46,526 --> 01:20:51,839
Stay on the bomb run, boys.
I'll get the doors open.

768
01:20:58,806 --> 01:21:02,481
HI THERE!
DEAR JOHN

769
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:48,240
Target orange grid-reference checks.
Target distance: 8 miles.

770
01:21:48,406 --> 01:21:54,959
Roger, 8 miles.
Guidance computer to orange grid.

771
01:22:03,526 --> 01:22:08,998
Target distance: 7 miles.
Correct track indicator minus seven.

772
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:14,604
- Set GPI acceleration factor.
- GPI acceleration factor set.

773
01:22:18,006 --> 01:22:22,682
- Target distance: 6 miles.
- Roger. 6 miles.

774
01:22:22,846 --> 01:22:26,202
Pulse transponder active.

775
01:22:33,246 --> 01:22:35,919
Target distance: 5 miles.

776
01:22:36,126 --> 01:22:41,996
5 miles.
Alignment factor to zero mode.

777
01:22:45,646 --> 01:22:49,605
- Target distance: 4 miles.
- Roger. 4 miles.

778
01:22:49,766 --> 01:22:54,886
Auto CDC to manual telefax link.

779
01:23:04,686 --> 01:23:09,680
- Target distance: 3 miles.
- Roger. 3 miles.

780
01:23:09,846 --> 01:23:15,284
Target in sight!
Where the hell is Major Kong?

781
01:23:35,926 --> 01:23:38,838
What about Major Kong?

782
01:24:04,366 --> 01:24:10,805
There is a chance to preserve
a nucleus of human specimens.

783
01:24:10,966 --> 01:24:13,560
It would be quite easy.

784
01:24:15,886 --> 01:24:20,835
At the bottom
of some of our deeper mine shafts.

785
01:24:21,006 --> 01:24:25,557
The radioactivity wouldn't penetrate
a mine thousands of feet deep.

786
01:24:25,726 --> 01:24:31,915
In a matter of weeks, improvements
in dwelling space could be provided.

787
01:24:32,086 --> 01:24:37,001
- How long would we stay there?
- Let's see now ...

788
01:24:38,126 --> 01:24:40,924
Cobalt chlorium G. ...

789
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:54,322
A radioactive half-life of ...

790
01:24:56,326 --> 01:25:01,923
I would think possibly 100 years.

791
01:25:02,086 --> 01:25:06,796
Could people stay down there
for 100 years?

792
01:25:07,006 --> 01:25:11,443
It would not
be difficult, mein Fhrer ....

793
01:25:11,646 --> 01:25:17,323
... Mr. President. Nuclear reactors
could provide power indefinitely.

794
01:25:17,486 --> 01:25:20,239
Greenhouses could grow plants.

795
01:25:20,446 --> 01:25:23,802
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

796
01:25:23,966 --> 01:25:27,879
A quick survey would have to be made
of available mine sites.

797
01:25:28,246 --> 01:25:35,243
I'd guess there would be space for
several hundred thousand people.

798
01:25:35,406 --> 01:25:41,117
I'd hate to have to decide
who stays up and who goes down.

799
01:25:41,286 --> 01:25:47,759
That could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

800
01:25:47,926 --> 01:25:54,923
It could be set to accept factors of
youth, health, sexual fertility, -

801
01:25:55,086 --> 01:25:58,681
- intelligence and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

802
01:25:58,846 --> 01:26:04,716
It'd be vital that top government
and military men be included, -

803
01:26:04,886 --> 01:26:09,437
- to impart the required principles
of leadership and tradition.

804
01:26:15,206 --> 01:26:20,883
They'd breed prodigiously,
with so little else to do.

805
01:26:22,326 --> 01:26:29,323
With a ratio of
ten females to each male -

806
01:26:29,486 --> 01:26:36,005
- they could achieve current gross
national product within 20 years.

807
01:26:37,246 --> 01:26:43,082
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors
be so grief-stricken -

808
01:26:43,246 --> 01:26:48,274
- that they'd envy the dead
and not want to go on living?

809
01:26:48,446 --> 01:26:51,438
No, sir ... Excuse me.

810
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:03,959
When they enter the mine,
everyone will still be alive.

811
01:27:04,126 --> 01:27:10,315
There'll be no shocking memories,
just a feeling of nostalgia.

812
01:27:10,486 --> 01:27:17,483
And a spirit of bold curiosity
for the adventure ahead.

813
01:27:32,286 --> 01:27:36,245
Doctor ...

814
01:27:36,446 --> 01:27:41,839
You mentioned a ratio
of ten women to each man.

815
01:27:42,046 --> 01:27:48,884
Would we abandon
monogamous sexual relationships?

816
01:27:49,046 --> 01:27:51,844
As far as men were concerned?

817
01:27:52,006 --> 01:27:58,525
Regrettably, the sacrifice must
be made for the future of our race.

818
01:27:58,686 --> 01:28:04,397
Since each man will be required
to do prodigious service ...

819
01:28:04,606 --> 01:28:10,681
... the woman must be selected
for their sexual characteristics, -

820
01:28:10,846 --> 01:28:14,316
- which will have to be
of a highly stimulating nature.

821
01:28:14,526 --> 01:28:20,476
- What an astonishingly good idea.
- Thank you, sir.

822
01:28:20,646 --> 01:28:25,242
We ought to look at this
from a military point of view.

823
01:28:25,406 --> 01:28:30,275
Supposing the Russkies stashed away
some bombs and we didn't.

824
01:28:30,446 --> 01:28:34,724
- In 100 years they could take over.
- I agree, Mr. President.

825
01:28:34,886 --> 01:28:38,879
They might even try
to take over our mine shaft spaces.

826
01:28:39,046 --> 01:28:45,519
It'd be naive of us to imagine that
this would change Soviet policy.

827
01:28:45,726 --> 01:28:50,846
We must be increasingly alert
to prevent them taking over.

828
01:28:51,006 --> 01:28:55,921
If they breed more prodigiously than
we do, they'd have superior numbers!

829
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:59,920
Mr. President,
we must not allow a mine-shaft gap!

830
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:05,723
Sir, I have a plan ...

831
01:29:05,886 --> 01:29:10,482
Mein Fhrer, I can walk!

832
01:30:39,346 --> 01:30:51,685
