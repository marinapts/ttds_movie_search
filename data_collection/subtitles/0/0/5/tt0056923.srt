1
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:51,989
Oh, la!

2
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:57,093
Don't tell me:
Ya didn't know it was loaded.

3
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,604
- Sylvie!
- Oh.

4
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:03,733
Can't he do something constructive,
like start an avalanche or something?

5
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,903
Vas jouer, mon chri.

6
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,509
When you start to eat like this,
something is the matter.

7
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,420
Sylvie,
I'm getting a divorce.

8
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,720
- What? From Charles?
- He's the only husband I have.

9
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:24,661
- I've tried to make it work,
really I have, but...
- But what?

10
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,258
Oh, I can't explain. I'm too miserable
to go on any longer like this.

11
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,471
It is infuriating that
your unhappiness does not turn to fat.

12
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,739
But I don't understand.
Why do you want a divorce?

13
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,714
Because I don't love him.
And he obviously doesn't love me.

14
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,308
That's no reason to get a divorce.

15
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,479
With a rich husband
and this year's clothes,

16
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,318
you won't find it difficult
to make some new friends.

17
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,985
I admit I came to Paris
to escape American provincial,

18
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,052
but that doesn't mean I'm ready
for French traditional.

19
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,758
I loathe the whole idea
of divorce, Sylvie.

20
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,027
But if only Charles had
been honest with me.

21
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,365
That's all I ask of anybody:
The simple truth.

22
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:09,136
But with Charles,
everything is secrecy and lies.

23
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,871
He's hiding something
from me, Sylvie...

24
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:16,472
something terrible...
and it frightens me.

25
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,483
Does he belong to you?

26
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,281
It's hers. Where'd you find him?
Robbing a bank?

27
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,481
He was throwing snowballs
at Baron Rothschild.

28
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,787
- Oh, thank you.
- Do we know each other?

29
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,295
- Do you think we're going to?
- How would I know?

30
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,888
Because I already know
an awful lot of people.

31
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,490
Until one of them dies
I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

32
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:39,732
Hmm. Well, if anyone goes
on the critical list let me know.

33
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,797
- Quitter.
- Beg pardon?

34
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,900
You give up
awfully easily, don't you?

35
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:48,743
Jean-Louis, let us walk.
I've never seen a Rothschild before.

36
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:58,250
Clever fellow. Almost missed me.

37
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,189
Thank you.

38
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,889
- You're blocking my view.
- Oh.

39
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,159
- Which view would you prefer?
- The one you're blocking.

40
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,760
It's my last chance.
I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon.

41
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,271
- What's your name?
- Peter Joshua.

42
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,899
- Mine's Regina Lampert.
- Is there a Mr. Lampert?

43
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,272
- Yes.
- Good for you.

44
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,935
No. I'm getting a divorce.

45
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,174
- Please, not on my account.
- No. I don't really love him.

46
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,775
- At least you're honest.
- Hmm. Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

47
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,184
Yes, but we're divorced.

48
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,552
That wasn't a proposal.
I'm just curious.

49
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,023
Is your husband with you?

50
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,583
Oh, no, Charles is never with me.
What do people call you? Pete?

51
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,095
Mr. Joshua.

52
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,463
- I've enjoyed talking with you.
- Now you're angry.

53
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,935
No, I just have a lot of packing to do.
I'm going back to Paris too.

54
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,939
Wasn't it Shakespeare who said
when strangers meet in far off lands...

55
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,975
they should ere long
see each other again?

56
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,205
- Shakespeare never said that.
- How do you know?

57
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,247
It's terrible.
You just made it up.

58
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,248
Well, it sounds right.
You going to call me?

59
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,614
- Are you in the book?
- Charles is.

60
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,812
- Is there only one Charles Lampert?
- Mmm.

61
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:06,321
Lord, I hope so.

62
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,028
Good-bye, Sylvie, and thanks.

63
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,438
When you get your divorce
are you going back to America?

64
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:27,343
- Don't you want me to stay?
- Of course, but if you went
back and wrote me a letter...

65
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,143
You could have the stamps.
I'll get you some here, okay?

66
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,117
- Okay.
- Good-bye.

67
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,728
Merci.

68
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,378
Honorine?

69
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,817
Honorine!

70
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,694
Aaaah!

71
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,424
- Madame Charles Lampert?
- Yes.

72
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:56,628
I'm Inspector Edouard Grandpierre
of the police judiciaire.

73
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,762
Would you be so kind
as to come with me, please?

74
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,685
Well, madame?

75
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,694
You are positive?

76
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,261
You loved him?

77
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,707
I'm very cold.

78
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,522
We discovered your husband's body...

79
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,923
lying next to the tracks
of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line.

80
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,288
He was dressed
only in his pyjamas.

81
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:02,232
Do you know any reason he might
have wanted to leave France?

82
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,394
Leave? No.

83
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,305
Your husband possessed a ticket
of passage on the Maranguape.

84
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,503
It sailed for Venezuela
this morning at 7:00.

85
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,512
I'm very confused.

86
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,107
- He was American, your husband?
- Swiss.

87
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,982
Ah, Swiss. His profession?

88
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,886
- He didn't have one.
- He was a wealthy man?

89
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,890
I suppose so. I don't know.

90
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,223
- About how wealthy, would you say?
- I don't know.

91
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,422
Where did he keep his money?

92
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,431
I don't know.

93
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,957
Besides yourself,
who is his nearest relative?

94
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,970
I don't know.

95
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,768
That's absurd, madame!
Totalement absurde.

96
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,071
I know. I'm sorry.

97
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,635
- It is all right?
- I wish you wouldn't.

98
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,578
- Les effets Lampert.
- D'accord.

99
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,791
Wednesday last your husband sold
the contents of the apartment
at public auction.

100
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,794
Everything.

101
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,127
The gallery paid him
1,250,000 new francs...

102
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,962
in dollars,
a quarter of a million.

103
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,402
The authorities in Bordeaux
searched his compartment on the train.

104
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,405
They searched it thoroughly.

105
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,374
They did not find $250000.

106
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,974
These few things are all that was found
in the train compartment.

107
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:29,215
There was no other baggage. Your husband
must have been in a great hurry.

108
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:33,486
One wallet containing 4,000 francs.

109
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,461
One agenda. His last notation
was made yesterday, Thursday...

110
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,328
5:00 p.m.,
Jardin de Champs Elyses.

111
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,390
- Why there?
- I don't know.

112
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,996
- Perhaps he met somebody.
- Obviously.

113
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,633
One ticket of passage
to South America.

114
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,544
One letter, stamped but unsealed,
addressed to you.

115
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,878
May I see it, please?

116
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,954
"My dear Regina, I hope you
are enjoying your holiday.

117
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,218
Megeve can be so lovely
at this time of year.

118
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,726
The days pass very slowly
and I hope to see you soon.

119
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,728
As always, Charles.

120
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:15,199
P.S. Your dentist called yesterday.
Your appointment has been changed."

121
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,201
Not much, is it?

122
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,635
We took the liberty
of calling your dentist.

123
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,639
We thought perhaps
we would learn something.

124
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,073
- Did you?
- Yes.

125
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,475
Your appointment has been changed.

126
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,749
One key to your apartment.

127
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,791
One comb.

128
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,884
One fountain pen.

129
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,259
One toothbrush.

130
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,458
One tin of tooth powder.
That is all.

131
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,771
If you will sign this list,
you may take the things with you.

132
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,333
Is that all?
May I leave now?

133
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,003
One more question.

134
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,014
Is this your husband's passport?

135
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,677
Yes.

136
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,686
And this?

137
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,749
I don't understand.

138
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,759
And this?

139
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,666
And this?

140
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,526
Oh, I telephoned but nobody answered.

141
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,367
- Hello.
- Hello.

142
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,738
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am
and see if there's anything I can do.

143
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,800
How did you find out?

144
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,244
It's in the afternoon papers.

145
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,182
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you.

146
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,152
I pressed the bell
but it isn't ringing, I guess.

147
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,155
I know.
There's no electricity.

148
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,559
Well, where did everything go?

149
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,755
Charles sold it at auction.
This is all I have left.

150
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,599
I love this room, but Charles
never saw it... only the things in it.

151
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,529
I think I prefer it this way.

152
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,708
What are you going to do?

153
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:41,268
Try and get my job back
at E.U.R.E.S.C.O., I suppose.

154
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:45,147
- Doing what?
- I'm a simultaneous
translator, like Sylvie.

155
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,845
Only she's English into French
and I'm French into English.

156
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,321
That's what I was doing
before I married Charles.

157
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,790
The police probably think
I killed him.

158
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,123
"Instant divorce," you mean?

159
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,187
Something like that.

160
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,132
It's terrible to end it
this way, though...

161
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,637
tossed off a train
like a sack of third class mail.

162
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:09,037
- Well, come on. You can't stay here.
- I don't know where to go.

163
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,406
We'll find you a hotel.

164
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,203
Nothing too expensive.

165
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,374
I'm not a lady of leisure
anymore, you know.

166
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,542
Something clean and modest and
near enough to E.U.R.E.S.C. O...

167
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,086
so you can take a cab
when it rains.

168
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,384
- Okay?
- Okay.

169
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,107
Not a very large turnout, is it?

170
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,407
Didn't Charles have any friends?

171
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,448
Don't ask me.
I'm only the widow.

172
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,145
If Charles had died in bed,
we wouldn't even have him.

173
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,083
At least he knows
how to behave at funerals.

174
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,002
Have you no idea
who could have done it?

175
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,336
Until two days ago the only thing I
really knew about Charles was his name.

176
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,035
Now it seems I didn't
even know that.

177
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,789
- He must have known Charles pretty well.
- How can you tell?

178
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,891
He's allergic to him.

179
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,607
Bless you.

180
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,838
- Do you know him?
- Never seen him before.

181
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,417
"Arrivederci," Charlie.

182
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,292
Miz Lampert, ma'am...

183
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,455
Uh, Miz Lampert, ma'am,

184
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,292
Charlie had no call
of doin' it that-a-way.

185
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,802
No siree.

186
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,835
What next?

187
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,812
Mi pardon, madame.

188
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:42,946
- Merci.
- Pardon. Pardon.

189
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,388
Pardon. Pardon.

190
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,586
- Who's it from?
- The American Embassy.

191
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,674
I bluffed the old man out of
the last pot with a pair of deuces.

192
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,678
What's so depressing
about that?

193
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,681
Well, if I can do it,
what are the Russians doing to him?

194
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,360
Hello?

195
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,658
Hello?

196
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,529
Is there anything wrong,
Miss Tompkins?

197
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,296
Uh, Miss Tompkins isn't here.

198
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,502
Oh, I'm sorry. My secretary
must have gone to lunch.

199
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,205
- Uh, you are...
- Mrs. Charles Lampert.

200
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,047
Oh, yes. Please, uh,
come in, Mrs. Lampert.

201
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,816
Excuse me for a moment,
Mrs. Lampert.

202
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,414
It's a stubborn little devil.

203
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,824
Dry cleaning-wise,
things are all fouled up.

204
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:03,232
I had a really excellent man
on the Rue Ponthieu,

205
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,237
but H.Q. Asked us to use
the plant here in the building...

206
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,535
to ease the gold outflow.

207
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,269
Mr. Bartholomew, are you
quite sure you know who I am?

208
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,436
You're Charles Lampert's
widow, yes?

209
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,648
I'm very sorry.

210
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,748
Last time I sent out a tie,
only the spot came back.

211
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,022
Voila, as they say.

212
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,217
Won't you sit down,
Mrs. Lampert?

213
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:33,060
I've got something here.

214
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,396
I've got liverwurst, liverwurst,
chicken and liverwurst.

215
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,527
No, thank you.

216
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,335
Mrs. Lampert, do you know
what C.I.A. is?

217
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,773
I don't suppose it's
an airline, is it?

218
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,611
Central Intelligence Agency.
C.I.A.

219
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,649
You mean spies and all of that?

220
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,118
- Only we call them agents.
- "We"? You mean you...

221
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,155
Someone has to do it,
Mrs. Lampert.

222
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,214
I didn't think people like you
were supposed to admit...

223
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:05,924
Oh, I'm not an agent.
I'm an administrator, a desk jockey...

224
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:10,458
trying to run a bureau of overworked men
with underallocated...

225
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,469
- Funds.

226
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,903
Congress seems to think
that all a spy needs...

227
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:18,704
- Agent.
- Yes.

228
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:23,908
That all he needs is a code book,
a cyanide pill and he's in business.

229
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,913
What's all this got to do
with me, Mr. Bartholomew?

230
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,080
Your husband was wanted
by the United States government.

231
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,093
May I have a sandwich, please?

232
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,358
- Chicken or liverwurst?
- Chicken.

233
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:44,698
To be more specific, your husband
was wanted by this agency.

234
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,704
- So that was it.
- Yes.

235
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,967
We, of course, knew him
by his real name...

236
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,306
Voss. Charles Voss.

237
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,580
All right, Mrs. Voss.

238
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:01,381
I'd like you to look at this photograph
for a moment, please.

239
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:05,116
Tell us if you recogni...
Oh.

240
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,158
By the way, have you seen this one?

241
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,524
Scott, Cathy and Ham Jr.

242
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,325
- Very sweet.
- Aren't they?

243
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,231
- All right, Mrs. Voss...
- Please stop calling me that.

244
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:20,294
- Lampert's the name
on the marriage license.
- I'm terribly sorry.

245
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,570
Mrs. Lampert, would you look at that
and tell me if you recognize anyone?

246
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,373
Just a moment.
Have a good look.

247
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,910
- It's Charles.
- Very good.

248
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,612
He looks so young.
When was this taken?

249
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,315
1944. Next, please.

250
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,587
The man who was
at the funeral yesterday.

251
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,890
A tall man in a corduroy suit.

252
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:47,090
Does the name Tex Penthollow
mean anything to you?

253
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,598
No.

254
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,601
- You like some wine?
- No, thank you.

255
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,103
Next, please.

256
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,971
He was there too. A little less hair,
but it's the same one.

257
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,102
Do you know him, Mrs. Lampert?
Leopold W. Gideon?

258
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,442
- No.
- The last one, please.

259
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,280
That's a face
you don't forget.

260
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,252
- He was there too.
- Herman Scobie.

261
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:13,951
- You've never seen him before either?
- No, thank heaven.

262
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:18,587
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you are
in a great deal of danger.

263
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,790
Why should I be in any danger?

264
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,733
You're Charles Voss' wife.

265
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,963
Now that he's dead
you're their only lead.

266
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,734
Mr. Bartholomew,
if you're trying to frighten me...

267
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,072
you're doing a first-rate job.

268
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,635
Please do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert.
It's your only chance.

269
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,547
Gladly. But I don't know what you want.
You haven't told me.

270
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,484
Oh? I haven't?

271
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,054
Well, it's the money,
Mrs. Lampert, the money.

272
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:50,288
The $250,000 Charles Voss
received from the auction.

273
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,195
Those three men want it too.
They want it very badly.

274
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,961
But that's Charles' money,
not theirs.

275
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,299
Oh, Mrs. Lampert, I'd love to see you
try and convince them of that.

276
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:03,068
- Oh, boy.
- But then whose is it? His or theirs?

277
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,976
Ours.

278
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,308
Oh.

279
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,339
Charles Voss stole $250,000
from the United States government.

280
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:16,285
- I'm afraid we want it back.
- But I don't have it.

281
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:20,119
That's impossible, Mrs. Lampert.

282
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,126
You're the only one
who could have it.

283
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:25,322
Mr. Bartholomew, if I had
a quarter of a million dollars,

284
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,365
believe me, I'd know it.

285
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:30,265
Nevertheless, Mrs. Lampert,
you've got it.

286
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,327
You mean it's just lying around
somewhere, all that cash?

287
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:38,536
Or a certified check,
safe deposit key, baggage claim.

288
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,544
- You look for it, Mrs. Lampert.
I'm quite sure you'll find it.
- But...

289
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:45,106
Look for it. Look just as hard
and as fast as you can.

290
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,549
You may not have
a great deal of time.

291
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,680
Those three men know you've got
the money just as surely as we do.

292
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,054
You won't be safe until
the money's in our hands.

293
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,286
Is that clear?

294
00:24:56,361 --> 00:25:00,320
Here's where you're
to call me, day or night.

295
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,798
It's a direct line
to both my office...

296
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,802
And my apartment.

297
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,236
And please don't tell anyone
about coming to see us today.

298
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,637
It could prove fatal
for them as well as yourself.

299
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,973
As I said, Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid
you're in a great deal of danger.

300
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,502
I regret very much
having to say this, but...

301
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,845
please remember
what happened to your husband.

302
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,162
- Hello.
- Hello, Peter.

303
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:41,069
Didn't you telephone me to meet you
on that corner over there?

304
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,334
I'm sorry.
I heard the children laughing.

305
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,609
- Do you understand French?
- Not a word.

306
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,205
I'm still having trouble
with English.

307
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,717
The man and the woman
are married.

308
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,845
Oh, I can see that. They're batting
each other over the head.

309
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,913
Ay, ay, ay!

310
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,858
- Ooh, la, la, la!
Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe?

311
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,125
- Who's that with the hat?
- That's the policeman.

312
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,757
He wants to arrest Judy
for killing Punch.

313
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,531
- What's she saying now?
- That she's innocent.

314
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,541
She didn't do it.

315
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:21,101
- Oh, she did it, all right.
- I believe her.

316
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,308
- Well, who was that?
- That's Punch, of course.

317
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,944
"Punch, of course"?
I thought he was dead.

318
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,046
He's only pretending,
to teach her a lesson.

319
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,655
Only he is dead, Peter.
I saw him. He's not pretending.

320
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,459
Somebody threw him off a train.

321
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:44,901
Charles was mixed up in something
terrible. What am I going to do?

322
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,995
I wish you'd let me help you.

323
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,973
It doesn't sound like the sort of thing
a young woman can handle by herself.

324
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:57,477
How 'bout making me vice president
in charge of cheering you up?

325
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,684
Starting tonight?

326
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:12,022
Bonsoir, messieurs, dames,
ladies and gentlemen,
buona sera, signore e signori.

327
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:16,329
Ce soir, comme tous les autres
soirs d'ailleurs, vous savez bien...

328
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,303
qui ici au Black Sheep Club,
l'attraction, c'est vous!

329
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,967
- Alors, approchez-vous,
messieurs, dames,

330
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,203
venez ici, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen,

331
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:29,007
- What's going on?
- Fun and games.

332
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,776
- Evidently we're
the floor show. Come on.
- You and me?

333
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,478
Everyone.

334
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,747
Avanti, avanti, signore e signori.

335
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,914
Ecoutez-moi bien.

336
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,390
Ah, coutez-moi.
Alors, il y a deux quipes.

337
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,122
There are two teams, et pour
chaque quipe, il y a une orange.

338
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:49,064
For every team there is one orange.
Una aranja.

339
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,467
Vous mettez l'orange
sur le menton comme a...

340
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,129
put the orange in like so.

341
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,968
Vous passez l'orange  la
personne derrire vous...

342
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,009
You pass the orange
to the person behind you,

343
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,203
mais sans utilisez les mains.

344
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,247
Without the use of your hands.
Are you ready?

345
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,647
Uno, due, tre...

346
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,310
- Mrs. Lampert,
- Who are you?

347
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,285
- Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
- Tell me what?

348
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,914
It doesn't belong to you.
You do know that, don't you?

349
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,857
- I don't know anyth...
- Mrs. Lampert!

350
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:58,521
Any morning now you could
wake up dead, Mrs. Lampert.

351
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:02,999
- Leave me alone!
- Dead, Mrs. Lampert.
Like Charles, Mrs. Lampert.

352
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,126
Stop it!

353
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,437
- What's the trouble?
- He stepped on my foot.

354
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,737
- Forgive me.
- Wait here. I won't be long.

355
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,074
It was quite unintentional,
I'm sure.

356
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,156
Mr. Bartholomew,
this is Regina Lampert.

357
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:40,671
I just saw one of those m...
Mr. Bartholomew, can you hear me?

358
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,573
Mr. Bartholomew,
this is Regina Lampert. I just...

359
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,712
- Howdy.
- What do you want?

360
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,380
- You must be kiddin'.
- No, I'm not.

361
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,389
Come on now, Miz Lampert.

362
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:03,154
You know what it is,
and you're gonna get it for me too.

363
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,322
'Cause you know
I ain't foolin' around here.

364
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,803
No siree Bob.

365
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,703
- Stop that, please!
- Now, don't make too much noise,
Miz Lampert.

366
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,939
It could get a whole lot worse,
you know.

367
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,845
- It belongs to me, Miz Lampert,
and you're gonna get it for me,

368
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,946
Or your life ain't gonna be worth
the paper it's printed on.

369
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,481
- You understand what I'm sayin' to you?
- Stop! Please stop!

370
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,587
- You go home and think it over
real careful like, you hear?
- You're absolutely insane!

371
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,637
- Aaaaah!

372
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,908
- What's the matter?

373
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,240
What are you doing in here?

374
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,914
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

375
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,495
Now hold it. I've waited long enough.
What happened back there?

376
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,795
I'm not sure if I'm supposed
to tell you or not.

377
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,860
- What does that mean?
- He said if I told anybody...

378
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,998
it could prove fatal for them
as well as me.

379
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,770
- Who said?
- That's what I'm not supposed to say.

380
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,505
Eh...

381
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,207
- Now stop that nonsense.
- Stop bullying me.

382
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,716
- Everybody's bullying me.
- I'm not bullying you.

383
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,276
Yes, you were.
You said it was nonsense.

384
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,482
Being murdered in cold blood
is not nonsense.

385
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,991
Why don't you try it sometime?

386
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,253
- Would you mind seeing me to the door?
- Of course not.

387
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,266
It's a good place
for making friends.

388
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,035
You said this afternoon your husband
was mixed up in something.

389
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,100
How do you shave in there?

390
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,112
What was it?

391
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,377
- What was what?
- What your husband was mixed up in.

392
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,578
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch
your imagination, but don't you think...

393
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,315
you could pretend just for a moment
that I'm a woman?

394
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,450
I could already be arrested
for transporting a minor
above the first floor.

395
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,153
- Here you are.
- Where?

396
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,496
- On the street where you live.
- How about once more around the park?

397
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,230
How about getting out of here?
Come on, child. Out.

398
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,532
- Won't you come in for a minute?
- No, I won't.

399
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,279
I don't bite, you know,
unless it's called for.

400
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,341
- How would you like a spanking?
- How'd you like a punch in the nose?

401
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:46,322
- Stop treating me like a child.
- Well, then stop behaving like one.

402
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,450
If you want to tell me
what's troubling you, fine.

403
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,086
If not, I'm tired, it's late
and I want to go home to bed.

404
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,097
Oh...

405
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,395
Do you know
what's wrong with you?

406
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,935
No. What?

407
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,868
Nothing.

408
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,014
Aaaah!

409
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,347
Where is it, lady?

410
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,353
I don't know.

411
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,620
I want it.

412
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,299
You give it to me.

413
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:32,234
- It's mine!
- Aaaaah!

414
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,740
Peter! Peter!

415
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,242
- A man tried to kill me!
- What?

416
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,035
Peter?

417
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,138
Peter?

418
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,402
Peter, are you all right?

419
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,037
- Oh, Peter. Are you hurt?

420
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,479
Mm-hmm.
I sprained my pride.

421
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,675
How are you?

422
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,776
- Scared.
- You'll be all right.

423
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,346
- Where did he go?
- Out the window, I guess.

424
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,393
Lock the door, and don't
let anyone in except me.

425
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,055
- And close these windows after me.
- Be careful.

426
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,326
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

427
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,355
Alistair!

428
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,054
- What is it now, Pamela?
- It happened again!

429
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:09,589
Another strange man peered
in the window at me but then went away.

430
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,760
Bad luck, Pamela.

431
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,786
- That was a dumb move, Herman.
- Oh, man. And then some.

432
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,828
If you'd let us know
you was goin' to her room...

433
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,829
we could have done
somethin' to keep him busy.

434
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:43,333
But sneakin' up
that-a-way by yourself.

435
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,835
What did you expect him to do?

436
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,872
Walk up and shake you
by that hand of yours?

437
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,874
Dumb move, Herman.

438
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,571
Yes, it was a dumb move, Herman.
What is the matter with you?

439
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:58,775
- You want some more?
- Never mind that. Did you get the money?

440
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:03,115
How could I with the three Marx Brothers
breathing down my neck?

441
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,781
I thought we had an agreement.

442
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,325
Now, the girl trusts me.

443
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,726
If she's got the money I'll find out
about it. But you just leave me alone.

444
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:17,928
We took all the chances.
The money belongs to us, not to him.

445
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,233
Now, don't be piggy, Herman.

446
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:25,071
A third of nothing is nothing.
Just think about that.

447
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,509
But make up your mind.
She's waiting for me.

448
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,912
I don't see how another 24 hours
could hurt anything.

449
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,917
Not after all these years.

450
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,785
Then he gets it out of your share.

451
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,789
Not mine.

452
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,620
Not mine!

453
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,825
- Either one of you got
the room next to her?

454
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,892
- Yeah, I have. Why?
- Get another room. I want to use it.

455
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,904
Hmm.

456
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,672
If you do find that money,

457
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,774
you ain't gonna forget to tell
your buddies about it, are you?

458
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:11,151
- Don't worry.
- Oh, I ain't worryin'.

459
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,656
You see this little fella here?

460
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,386
Oh, he worries.

461
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,655
And he's even meaner than I am.

462
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,210
- Who is it?
- It's me, Peter.

463
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,999
There was no trace of him.

464
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:09,273
Why don't you confide in me
and tell me what this is all about?

465
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,812
There are three men.
He's one of them.

466
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:17,376
They think I have a quarter of
a million dollars that belongs to them.

467
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,021
- Go on.
- That's all.

468
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,029
- No, it isn't. Where's the money?
- I don't know!

469
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,122
They killed Charles to get it,

470
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,997
but he must not have had it
with him on the train.

471
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,536
- So they think he left it with you.
- But he didn't.

472
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,835
I've looked everywhere, and if I don't
find it they're going to kill me.

473
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,840
No, they won't.
I won't let them.

474
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,047
Peter, help me.
You're the only one I can trust.

475
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,086
I'll help you.

476
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,383
I told you I would. Come on.

477
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:54,652
Oh, I'm so hungry I could faint.

478
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,285
And I've gotten your suit all wet.

479
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:01,354
- That's all right. It's a drip-dry.

480
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,866
- Wipe your eyes.

481
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,894
Promise me you'll never lie to me
the way Charles did.

482
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,770
Why do people have to tell lies?

483
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:15,505
Usually because they want something.
They're afraid the truth won't get it.

484
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,810
- Do you tell lies?

485
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,884
- Hello?
- Mrs. Lampert, it's me,

486
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,758
the man who was in your room
a few minutes ago.

487
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,463
- What do you want?
- Who is it?

488
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,729
It's the man
you had the fight with.

489
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,897
- Is Dyle with you?
- Who?

490
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:46,432
The man I had the fight with, lady.
Dyle. That's his name.

491
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,138
What's wrong?
Is he still there?

493
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,278
- Yes, that's right.
- What's he saying?

494
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:02,451
Don't trust him.
Don't tell him anything.

495
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,756
He's after the money.

496
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,871
What was all that about?

497
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,307
He...

498
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:22,402
- He said if I don't give him
the money he'll kill me.
- Oh, don't take it seriously.

499
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,507
He's just trying to frighten you.

500
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,951
- I believe what he said.
- No, no. It's just a lot of words.

501
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,352
Words can hurt.

502
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,357
I know.

503
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,360
Try to get some sleep.
You'll feel better.

504
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:41,990
Don't worry. I've arranged
to take the room next door to you.

505
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,233
So you'll be all right.

506
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,669
If you want anything,
just bang on the wall.

507
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,333
Better lock the door after me.

508
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,172
Good night.

509
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,440
I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew.

510
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,875
What I'm trying to say
is that there's someone else.

511
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,937
- What?
- Someone who wasn't in that photograph today.

512
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,451
He says his name is Peter Joshua,
but it isn't. It's Dyle.

513
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:40,519
- Are you still there, Mr. Bartholomew?
- Yes, yes, Mrs. Lampert.

514
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,752
I don't know
who this Mr. Dyle is,

515
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,920
but it's possible we were wrong
about who killed your husband.

516
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:49,159
You mean... he might have?

517
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,728
Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching
the next plane out of here.

518
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:55,931
I'm not going to sit around for somebody
to make chopped liver out of me.

519
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,271
Now, take it easy,
Mrs. Lampert. Take it easy.

520
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,278
Where are you now?
Can you meet me at the market?

521
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,372
- At Les Halles?
- Yes. Opposite St. Eustace.

522
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,146
- I'll meet you there in 15 minutes.
- All right, I'll be there.

523
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,325
Allez vite, n'importe ou.
N'importe ou! Vite!

524
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,179
Suivez ce taxi.

525
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:19,755
- Were you followed?
- Yes, by Dyle. But I lost him.

526
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,314
I'm beginning to think women
make the best spies.

527
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,327
Agents.

528
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,523
- He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew.
- No.

529
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,829
- But I saw it.
- No, that's not Carson Dyle.

530
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:34,462
- Carson?
- There's only one Dyle connected
with this affair, Mrs. Lampert.

531
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,472
That's Carson Dyle.

532
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,703
You mean you've known
about him all along?

533
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:43,372
It's enough to make you
a vegetarian, isn't it?

534
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:47,349
It's just lucky I'm not hanging
next to one of those right now.

535
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,352
Why didn't you tell me
you knew about Dyle?

536
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,549
I didn't see any point.
Dyle's dead.

537
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,089
Mr. Bartholomew,
what is all this about?

538
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:03,122
In 1944, five members
of the O.S. S...

539
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,532
the military espionage unit...

540
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,763
were ordered
behind the German lines...

541
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:13,276
for the purpose of delivering
$250,000 in gold...

542
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,811
to the French underground.

543
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,279
The five men
were your husband Charles,

544
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,044
the three men
at his funeral yesterday...

545
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:24,417
- and Carson Dyle.
- Oh.

546
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:27,753
But instead of delivering
the gold, they stole it.

547
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:30,293
- How?
- By burying it,

548
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,158
then reporting
the Germans had captured it.

549
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,528
All they had to do was
come back after the war,

550
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,227
dig it up
and split it five ways.

551
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:42,671
Quarter of a million dollars
with no questions asked.

552
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,038
May I have a cigarette,
please?

553
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,203
I can't stand those things.

554
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:51,247
It's like drinking coffee
through a veil.

555
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:55,513
Everything went smoothly enough
until after the gold was buried.

556
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,818
Before they could get out
they were ambushed by a German patrol.

557
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,326
A machine gun separated
Scobie from his right hand...

558
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,385
and caught Carson Dyle
full in the stomach.

559
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,264
What was wrong with that one?

560
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,861
Nothing, I guess.
What happened then?

561
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,032
Have you any idea what
these things cost over here?

562
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,305
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew.
What happened then?

563
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,975
Carson Dyle was dead,
but Scobie was able to travel. So...

564
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,953
- La soupe, c'est pour qui?
- Pour moi.

565
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,466
Where was I?

566
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,968
- Carson Dyle was dead.
- Yes.

567
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:49,164
The others finally got back to the base
and waited for the war to end,

568
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,072
only Charles couldn't wait
quite as long as the others.

569
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,908
He beat them back to the gold, took
everything for himself and disappeared.

570
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,847
It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all
this time to catch up with him again.

571
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,819
But if they stole all that money,
why can't you arrest them?

572
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,253
Shh!

573
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,589
We know what happened from the bits
we were able to paste together,

574
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,686
but we still have no proof.

575
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,357
What's this got to do
with the C.I.O.?

576
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,362
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert.

577
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:25,840
It's an extension
of the wartime O.S.S.

578
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,968
It's our money
and we want it back.

579
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:31,811
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing
you've said has changed my mind.

580
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,043
I'm leaving Paris tonight.

581
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,746
Wouldn't advise that,
Mrs. Lampert.

582
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:41,154
Better consider what happened
to your husband when he tried to leave.

583
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,921
Those men won't be very far away
no matter where you go.

584
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,895
In fact, I don't even see any point
in your changing hotels.

585
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,694
Now, please help us,
Mrs. Lampert.

586
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,360
Your government
is counting on you.

587
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:57,868
Well, if I'm going to die I might
as well do it for my country.

588
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,172
That's the spirit.
Here's what I want you to do.

589
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,840
We're anxious to know who this man is,
the one calling himself Dyle.

590
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,849
I want you to find out.

591
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,181
Why me?

592
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,949
You're in an ideal position.
He trusts you.

593
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:17,517
Besides, you yourself said
women make the best spies.

594
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,222
Agents.

595
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,610
Oh, pardon.

596
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,726
- Fraulein. Fraulein!
- What are you doing following me?

597
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,831
It's gonna look like a parade.
Stop it!

598
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,514
How are you? Nice to see you.
When did you arrive?

599
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,780
It's a lovely town. Are you having
a good time? So many things to see.

600
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:26,226
Fraulein! Fraulein!

601
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,356
If you don't stop following me
I'll call the police!

602
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,298
Taxi!

603
00:49:56,426 --> 00:50:00,522
- Dyle, please. D-Y-L-E.
- Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

604
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:09,496
- No, I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle. Nothing today.
- Thank you.

605
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:12,804
Mr. Dyle, please.
You're wanted on the telephone.

606
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,969
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four.

607
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,377
Mr. Dyle. Cabin four, please.

608
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:28,823
- Yes?
- Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

609
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,362
- Reggie?
- It's the only name I've got.
How 'bout you?

610
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,921
No cat and mouse. You've got me.
What do you want to know?

611
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,433
Why you lied to me!

612
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,266
I had to. For all I knew
you were in on the whole thing.

613
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:45,035
- I'm trying to find out who you are.
- You know my name. It's Dyle.

614
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,042
Carson Dyle is dead.

615
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,510
Yes, he is. He was my brother.

616
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,915
Your brother?

617
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:56,043
The army thinks he was
killed in action by the Germans,

618
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,180
but I think they did it...
Tex, Gideon, Scobie and your husband...

619
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,715
because my brother wouldn't go along
with their scheme to steal the gold.

620
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,058
I think he threatened to turn them in
and they killed him.

621
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:11,157
I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm
working with them, but I'm not, Reggie.

622
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,429
I'm on your side.
Just believe that.

623
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,438
How can I? You lied to me
just the way Charles did.

624
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,440
After promising you wouldn't.

625
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,068
Oh, I want to believe you,
Peter...

626
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,078
I can't call you that anymore,
can I?

627
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:27,082
Take me a while to get used to
your new name. What is it?

628
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:32,918
Hmm? Hello? Hello?

628
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,596
Do anything funny or try to talk
to anyone and I'll kill you, Dyle.

630
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,868
You'll wreck your raincoat.

631
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,910
Take the next car, please.

632
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,789
Look out. Didn't want you
to bump your head.

633
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,329
All right, get in there.

634
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,038
All right, turn around.

635
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,348
- Now sit down.

636
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:58,196
- Now what?
- We wait. With our mouth shut.

679
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,076
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

637
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:22,997
Okay. Up there.

638
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,006
- Do I knock or something?
- No, open it...

639
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,569
and keep right on goin'.

640
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,172
The view had better be worth it.

641
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,356
Very pretty. Now what?

642
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,429
I was afraid of that.

643
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:10,279
I'll give you a chance, Dyle,
which is more than you'd give me.

644
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,282
Where's the money?

645
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,710
Is that why you dragged me
all the way up here?

646
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,720
To ask me that?

647
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:22,918
- She has it.
- And I say maybe you both have it.

648
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:27,453
One more time, Dyle.
Where is it?

649
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,899
Supposing I had it...
which I don't...

650
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:35,335
do you really think I'd
just hand it over to you?

651
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,242
Step back.

652
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,113
Back where?

653
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,911
That's the idea.

654
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:52,853
Hmm. N-Now, just a minute.
Take it easy.

655
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:42,090
- Herman?
- What?

656
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,903
- How you doing?
- How do you think?

657
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,905
If you get bored,

658
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,908
try writing "Love thy neighbor"
100 times on the side of the building.

659
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,714
Monsieur, next time,
please, use the keyhole, hmm?

660
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,071
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

661
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,866
- You gonna open up?
- Sure. Wait a minute.

662
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:32,210
Don't you know it's impolite to leave
someone holding... the phone?

663
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,216
What happened?

664
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,481
Oh, I met a man with sharp nails.

665
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,622
- Scobie?
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:44,421
I left him hanging around
the American Express.

667
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:47,429
Come in. I've got something
that stings like crazy.

668
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,432
You're the kind of girl
that'd have something like that.

669
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,434
Sit down.

670
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,436
Uh, w-w-wait a minute.

671
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,438
- W-W-What is that stuff?
- Marvelous stuff.

672
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,441
- Gonna hurt you much more
than it's gonna hurt me.
- I'll bet...

673
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,943
Ohh! Did you hear
something rip?

674
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,571
- No.
- Oh. That's odd.

675
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,584
Listen, I-I only
came in for an estimate.

676
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,086
Sit still.
It's not too bad.

677
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,022
You won't be able to lie
on your back for a few days.

678
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:18,026
- But then, you can lie
from any position, can't you?
- Oh-ho-ho...

679
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,028
- Ooooh!
- Does it hurt?

680
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,030
- What?
- Does it hurt?

681
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,032
- Ohh! Are you kidding?

682
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,536
Have you got a bullet I could bite,
like they do in the movies?

683
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,902
Are you really
Carson Dyle's brother?

684
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,407
Would you like to see
my passport?

685
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,035
Passport?
What kind of a proof is that?

686
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:38,274
- Well, would you like
to see where I was tattooed?
- Yes.

687
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,782
All right,
we'll drive around that way.

688
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:46,788
You could at least tell me
what your first name is these days.

689
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,620
Alexander.

690
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,626
Okay, Alexander.

691
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,628
- You're done.
- Good.

692
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,130
You're a new man.

693
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,134
I'm sorry the old one
couldn't tell you the truth,

694
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,660
but I had to find out
your part in all this.

695
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,673
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

696
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,676
Yes, but we're divorced.

697
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,373
I thought that was Peter Joshua.

698
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:14,314
I'm just as difficult
to live with as he was.

699
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:18,520
Alex, how can you tell
if anyone's lying or not?

700
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,123
- You can't.
- There must be some way.

701
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:25,126
There's an old riddle
about two tribes of Indians.

702
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:28,254
The Whitefeet always tell the truth
and the Blackfeet always lie.

703
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,265
One day you meet an Indian,
you say,

704
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:34,269
"Hey, Indian, what are you, a truthful
Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot?"

705
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,363
He says, "I'm a truthful Whitefoot."
But which is he?

706
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,310
Why couldn't you just
look at his feet?

707
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,175
Because he's wearing moccasins.

708
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,681
Well, then,
he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.

709
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,376
Why not a lying Blackfoot?

710
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:53,552
- Which one are you?
- A truthful Whitefoot.

711
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,384
Come in.

712
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,894
- Sit down.
- Why? Do you wanna look at my feet?

713
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:02,193
Yes.

714
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,199
- Uh...
- Ohh.

715
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,202
Hey, knock it off.
Come on, Reggie, listen to me.

716
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,204
Here it comes,
the fatherly talk.

717
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,400
- You forget I'm already a widow.
- So was Juliet, at 15.

718
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,774
- But I'm not 15.
- Well, that's your trouble...
you're too old for me.

719
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:19,110
- Can't you be serious?
- Oh! You just said an horrible word.

720
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,582
- What did I say?
- Serious.

721
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:25,143
When a man gets to be my age, that's
the last word he ever wants to hear.

722
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:29,180
I don't want to be serious,
and I especially don't want you to be.

723
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:33,695
Okay, we'll just sit around all day
being frivolous. How about that, hmm?

724
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:36,231
- Reggie, cut it out.

725
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,234
Okay.

726
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,793
- Now what are you doing?
- Cutting it out.

727
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:44,203
- Who told you to do that?
- You did.

728
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,366
I'm not through
complaining yet.

729
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:48,376
Oh.

730
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,547
- Now cut it out.
- Alex, I think I love you.

731
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:01,115
- Hey, the telephone's ringing.

732
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,124
- Never mind.

733
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:06,127
Whoever it is won't give up,
and neither will I.

734
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,129
Just a minute.
Go on, take it.

735
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,690
Hello.

736
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,932
I'm sorry, uh...
I was just, uh...

737
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,939
nibbling on something.

738
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,941
Say, I'd appreciate it
mighty highly...

739
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,945
if you'd, uh, wiggle on over to room 46
and chew the fat for a spell.

740
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,277
Give me one reason
why I should.

741
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:30,945
Yeah. A little one,
about six or seven.

742
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,250
Keeps callin' for Aunt Reggie.

743
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,950
Ain't that cute?

744
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,391
They've got Jean-Louis.

745
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,189
I'll be right there.

746
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:48,603
Hey, Tex, do somethin' with this kid,
will ya? My leg's goin' to sleep.

748
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,265
Upsy-daisy.

749
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,274
Are you a real cowboy?

750
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,276
Yeah, sure I am, kid.

751
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,278
So where's your gun?

752
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,344
Will you put that thing away!

753
01:02:03,419 --> 01:02:05,353
Jean-Louis.

754
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,446
Howdy, Miz Lampert.

755
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,458
Who invited him?

756
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,960
Well, Herman,
I see you had a happy landing.

757
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,894
I must call Sylvie right away.

758
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,899
- I'm afraid that'll
have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
- It's his mother.

759
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,130
She won't be anybody's mother
unless you answer some questions.

760
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:24,264
- This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
- We want that money now.

761
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,707
Why don't you keep quiet
and stop threatening the child.

762
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:31,406
He hasn't got the money,
and neither has Mrs. Lampert.

763
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,812
Then who does?

764
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,874
I don't know, Herman.
Maybe you do.

765
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,681
Me?

766
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,587
- Or you.
- Ohh!

767
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:43,921
- Or him.
- Why, that's the most
ridiculous thing I ever...

768
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,928
- Listen to this man.
- Man's gone loco.

769
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:51,695
Now hold it. Suppose one of you
found Charles here in Paris.

770
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,702
Even bumped into him
by accident,

771
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,331
followed him when he tried to run out
again, cornered him on the train,

772
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:00,341
threw him out the window and,
without bothering to tell the other two,

773
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,343
took all the money for yourself.

774
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:05,869
If one of us did that,
he wouldn't hang around waiting
for the other two to figure it out.

775
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,850
But he'd have to. Don't you see?
If he left, he'd be admitting his guilt.

776
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,888
Whoever it is has to wait here
pretending to look for the money,

777
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,083
waiting for the rest of us
to give up and go home.

778
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,424
He's just tryin' to throw us off.
They got it, I tell ya.

779
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:21,929
Why don't we
search their rooms?

780
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:24,933
That's all right with us.

781
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:28,437
Then what are we wastin' time for?
Let's go.

782
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,371
- While we're waiting,
we'll search yours.
- Not my room!

783
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,399
Well, Herman.
You have something to hide?

784
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:39,775
Then there are no objections.

785
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,783
All right, here's my key.

786
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,547
- I'll take that.
- My room's open.

787
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,554
Everyone. Whoa. Come on.

788
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,726
Now, you two just
make yourselves to home here.

789
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,463
Well, let's get busy.

790
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:58,989
Come on, Jean-Louis.
Come on. Oh, that's fine.

791
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:02,003
- Who gets your vote?
- Scobie. He's the one who objected.

792
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:05,006
All right, I'll take
Tex's room here and Gideon's.

793
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:08,134
You take Jean-Louis with you,
and bolt the door from inside.

794
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,907
Come on, Jean-Louis.
We'll have a treasure hunt.

795
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,450
Tex?

796
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,988
Man, that's Charlie's stuff.

797
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:21,990
Looks like it.

798
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,492
- Think we ought to call Herman?
- What for?

799
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,495
If it's not here,
why bother him?

800
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,622
And if it is?

801
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,758
Why bother him?

802
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,538
Oh.

803
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:40,675
- What?
- Sure there's nothing missing here?

804
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:44,873
No, everything's here. The police
have kindly provided us with a list.

805
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,350
Sure ain't nothin' here worth
no quarter of a million dollars.

806
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,352
Not unless we're blind.

807
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:54,685
I keep telling myself we've
stolen a great deal of money,

808
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,692
but up to now I've yet
to see a penny of it.

809
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,786
You think maybe we're fishin'
up the wrong stream?

810
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:04,032
Meaning what?

811
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,934
Suppose one of us has it.
You know, like the man says.

812
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,199
Now, that'd be
mighty distasteful,

813
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,208
us bein' veterans
of the same war and all.

814
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:18,043
Well, you know I'd tell you
if I had it.

815
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:21,277
Naturally. Just like I'd
tell you if I had it.

816
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,284
Naturally.

817
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,616
And that goes for Herman too.

818
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,815
Naturally.

819
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,156
He's all right, Sylvie.
Honestly.

820
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,324
Just hurry over as soon
as you can. Okay. Good-bye.

821
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:42,729
Now, if you had a treasure,
where would you hide it?

822
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,940
I would bury it in the garden.

823
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:48,943
Swell, but this man
doesn't have a garden.

824
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,445
- Oh, neither do I.
- You don't?

825
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:55,575
Well, if you had to hide it
in this room, where would you put it?

826
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:58,415
- Up there.
- On top of that cupboard?

827
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,945
You know something?
You may be right.

828
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:09,731
Oh, I hope I don't find any hairy
little things living up here.

829
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:13,495
Hey, there is something.
And it's heavy.

830
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,935
I found it!
I found it! I found it!

831
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:19,270
If you think you're getting credit
for this, you're crazy.

832
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,435
We won! We won! We won!

833
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:24,638
We won! We won!
We won! We won!

834
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:28,114
We found it! We found it!

835
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,118
- Did you find it?
- No.

836
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,121
- What do you mean, no?
- The kid was yellin'.

837
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,589
Up there. It's up there.

838
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,388
Believe me,
there's nothing up there.

839
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,395
Yeah?

840
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,766
Oh!

841
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,739
Oh! Jumpin' frijoles.

842
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,578
It's Herman's spare.

843
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:07,652
- Where is he?
- He's over in my room.

844
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:28,276
You'd better take the boy
out in the hall.

845
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:40,311
Oh, now, who would've done
a mean thing like that?

846
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,825
I'm not quite sure.

847
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,123
Well, this ain't my room.

848
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,129
Mine neither.

849
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:51,360
Oh, the police aren't going to
like this a bit.

850
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:55,461
We could dry him off and take him
down the hall to his own room.

851
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,938
He really doesn't look too bad.

852
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,032
Oh, poor old Herman.

853
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:04,307
Seems like him and good luck
always was strangers.

854
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:08,316
Well, maybe now he'll meet up
with his other hand someplace.

855
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,159
A man drowned in his bed?

856
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,162
Impossible.

857
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:25,826
And in his pyjamas... the second one
in his pyjamas. C'est trop stupide.

858
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:27,835
Stop lying to me.

859
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,838
This nose tells me
when you are lying.

860
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:34,103
It is never mistaken,
not in 23 years.

861
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:37,236
This nose will make me
Commissaire of Police.

862
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:41,374
Mr. Dyle, or Mr. Joshua...
Which is it?

863
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,384
Dyle.

864
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,683
And yet you registered
in Megeve as Mr. Joshua.

865
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:50,691
Didn't you know it was against the law
to register under an assumed name?

866
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:54,695
- No, I didn't.
- It's done in America all the time.

867
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:58,062
None of you will be
permitted to leave Paris...

868
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,227
until this matter is cleared up.

869
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:03,794
Only I warn you,
I will be watching.

870
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:07,969
We use the guillotine
in this country.

871
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:11,501
I have always suspected
that the blade coming down...

872
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,038
causes no more than
a slight tickling sensation...

873
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,551
on the back of the neck.

874
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,554
It is only a guess, of course.

875
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:22,887
I hope none of you
ever finds out for certain.

876
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,766
Who do you think did it?

877
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,962
- Gideon?
- Possibly.

878
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,665
- Or Tex?
- Possibly.

879
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,674
- You're a fat lot of help.
- That's right.

880
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,676
- Can I have one of those?
- What?

881
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,678
- I think Tex did it.
- Oh.

882
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:46,681
- Vanille et chocolat, s'il vous plait.
- Why do you think Tex did it?

883
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,683
Because I really suspect Gideon,

884
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,219
and it's always the person
you don't suspect.

885
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,745
Do women think it feminine to be
so illogical, or can't they help it?

886
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,757
What's so illogical about that?

887
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:59,760
You just said it's always
the one you don't suspect.

888
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,763
If you suspect Gideon,
therefore it must be Tex.

889
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,267
On the other hand, if you suspect Tex
it must be the other fella, Gideon.

890
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,599
- I guess they just can't help it.
- Hmm?

891
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:10,605
- Who?
- Women.

892
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,607
Oh.

893
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,940
You know, I can't help feeling
rather sorry for Scobie.

894
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,946
Wouldn't it be nice
if we were like that?

895
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,948
- What, like Scobie?
- No. Gene Kelly.

896
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:23,951
You remember when he danced down here
by the river in An American In Paris...

897
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,953
without a care in the world?

898
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,888
- Mmm.
- You know, this is good. Want some?

899
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,825
- Uh...
- Ohh!

900
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,828
No, thanks.

901
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:37,525
- I guess you don't either.
Here, give me that.

902
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,659
I'm sorry.

903
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,636
Alex, I'm scared.

904
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,730
Yes, I know.

905
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,674
I can't think of any reason
why he was killed.

906
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,974
Well, perhaps someone thought
that four shares were too many.

907
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:54,743
What makes you think that this someone
is going to be satisfied with three?

908
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,752
He wants it all.
That means we're in his way too.

909
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,549
That's right.

910
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:03,854
We've got to do something. I mean,
any minute now we could be assassinated.

911
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,860
Would you do anything like that?

912
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,590
What, assassinate someone?

913
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:11,497
No. Swing down from there on a rope
to save the woman you love.

914
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,432
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame.

915
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:15,436
Uh... Huh?

916
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,439
- Who put that there?

917
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,804
Hurry up and change.
I'm starved.

918
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:27,315
Let me know what you want to eat
so I can pick out a suit that matches.

919
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,317
Ha ha ha ha.

920
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:41,420
Ah-ah-ah!
What do you want?

921
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,694
It's the house detective.
Why don't you have a girl in there?

922
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,701
God, you're a pest.

923
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:50,136
- Can I come in?
- No. I'm going to take a bath.

924
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:53,140
Wouldn't it be better
if you did it in here?

925
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,644
- What for?
- Well, I wouldn't want to use that tub.

926
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:59,704
Anyway, I don't want to be alone.
I'm afraid.

927
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:02,046
You're only next door.
If anything happens, holler.

928
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,487
Aaaah!

929
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:10,558
Reggie?

930
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,423
Got you. Ha ha.

931
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:16,328
Did you ever hear the story
of the boy who cried wolf?

932
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,696
The shower's in there.

933
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:22,294
- Oh, come on, open the door.
- This is a ludicrous situation.

934
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:25,807
I can think of a dozen men
who are just longing to use my shower.

935
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:29,275
- Why don't you call one of them?
- I dare you.

936
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,779
Oh, you're a nut.

937
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:37,315
- What are you doing?
- Taking off my shoes.

938
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,822
Did you ever hear of anyone taking
a shower with their shoes on?

939
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:46,828
I usually sing a medley of
old favorites when I'm in the shower.

940
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,762
- Any requests?
- Shut the door.

941
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:53,962
I'm afraid I don't know that one, miss.
Well...

942
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,095
- Shut the door!
- Why?

943
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:58,105
Come in and watch.

944
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,116
Drip-dry.

945
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:16,017
How often do you go through
this little ritual?

946
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,821
Oh, every day.
The manufacturer recommends it.

947
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,725
I don't believe it.

948
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:23,094
Oh, yes, it's...
Wait a minute.

949
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,667
- Read the label.

950
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,669
Look at the small print.

951
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,965
"Wearing this suit
during washing...

952
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,372
helps protect its shape."

953
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:39,013
Whoo! Ha ha!

954
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,018
Waterproof.

955
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:48,079
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.

956
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,489
Wait.

957
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,289
Acro-nylon.
Fibrous resistant.

958
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:57,298
- Plastic. Rustproof.
Fireproof. Proof-proof.

959
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,300
- You're the nut.
- Nut-proof!

960
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:08,038
- Yes?
- Mrs. Lampert? Bartholomew.

961
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,203
I spoke to Washington,
Mrs. Lampert.

962
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,770
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew.
I'm listening.

963
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:17,547
Well, I told them what you said about
this man being Carson Dyle's brother.

964
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:20,816
I asked them what they knew about it,
and they told me.

965
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,050
You're not gonna like this,
Mrs. Lampert.

966
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,719
Carson Dyle had no brother.

967
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,564
- Mrs. Lampert?
- Are you sure there's no mistake?

968
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,965
None whatsoever.
Please be careful, Mrs. Lampert.

969
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:35,970
Bye.

970
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,915
I left all my drip-dry dripping.
Is that all right?

971
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,042
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

972
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:53,120
You're probably weak
from hunger.

973
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,122
You've only eaten
five times today.

974
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,057
I'll fix up my suit
and take you out to dinner.

975
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:01,721
Let's go somewhere crowded.
I feel like a lot of people.

976
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:14,540
Hey, you know,
this thing is still damp.

977
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:21,741
You haven't spoken a word
for 20 minutes.

978
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:25,048
I was thinking about Charles and Scobie
and who's going to be next.

979
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,054
Me?

980
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:30,057
I don't suppose you know
who the murderer is, do you?

981
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,059
No. Not yet.

982
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,564
Whoever's left alive at the end will
pretty much have sewn up the nomination.

983
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:39,999
What are you trying to say, that I
might have killed Charles and Scobie?

984
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,969
What do I have to do to satisfy you?
Become the next victim?

985
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,973
- It's a start, anyway.
- Oh.

986
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,975
I can't understand you at all.

987
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,978
One minute you're chasing me
around the shower room.

988
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,640
The next minute you're
accusing me of murder.

989
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,649
Carson Dyle had no brother.

990
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:02,756
Oh, I can explain that,
if you'll just listen.

991
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:06,260
Well, I can't very well leave
without a pair of water wings, can I?

992
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:09,855
- All right, get set
for the story of my life.
- Fiction or nonfiction?

993
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:13,265
- Eh... Why don't you shut up?
- Well!

994
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,065
- Are you going to listen?
- Go on.

995
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,072
All right.

996
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:22,543
Now, when I was a young man my father
expected me to go into his business.

997
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,546
Umbrella frames.
That's what he made.

998
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:29,710
A sensible business, I suppose,
but I didn't have the sense
in those days to be sensible.

999
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,310
I suppose all this
is leading somewhere.

1000
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:35,550
Well, it led me away from
umbrella frames, for one thing.

1001
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,559
But that left me without
any honest means of support.

1002
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,561
What do you mean?

1003
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:42,563
Well, in this highly
competitive world,

1004
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:45,930
when a man has no profession
there isn't much choice,

1005
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,562
so I began looking for people
who had more money than they needed,

1006
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:51,765
including some they'd barely miss.

1007
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,899
You mean, you're a thief?

1008
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:57,412
Well, that's not exactly
the term I'd have chosen,

1009
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:01,210
but it sort of captures
the spirit of the thing.

1010
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:04,514
I don't believe it.

1011
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:07,111
I can't really blame you now.

1012
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:10,124
But I do believe it.
That's what I don't believe.

1013
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:13,457
So it's good-bye, Alexander Dyle,
welcome home, Peter Joshua.

1014
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:16,758
Sorry.
The name's Adam Canfield.

1015
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:20,427
- Adam Canfield?
- Mm-hmm.

1016
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,938
Wonderful. You've had three names
in the past two days.

1017
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:27,237
I don't even know
who I'm talking to anymore.

1018
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,540
- Well, the man's the same,
even if the name isn't.
- No, he isn't.

1019
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:33,877
- Adam Canfield is a crook,
and I want to know why.
- Well, it's simple.

1020
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,383
I like what I do.
I enjoy my work.

1021
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:39,386
There aren't many men who love
their work as much as I do.

1022
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:41,649
You look around sometime.

1023
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,157
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

1024
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,987
- Yes, but we're divorced.
- "But we're divorced."

1025
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:51,499
- That's right.
Now go and eat your dinner.
- Oh, I could eat a horse.

1026
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,500
I think that's what you ordered.

1027
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:57,004
Don't you dare be civil with me,
after leading me on like this.

1028
01:17:57,072 --> 01:18:00,508
- How did I lead you on?
- Oh, all that marvelous rejection.

1029
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:02,509
You knew I couldn't resist it.

1030
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:05,740
- Now it turns out all you're
interested in is the money.
- That's right.

1031
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:08,749
- Ohh!
- Well, what would you like me to say?

1032
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:12,253
That a pretty girl with
an outrageous manner means more
to an old pro like me...

1033
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,185
than a quarter
of a million dollars?

1034
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,783
- I don't suppose so.
- It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.

1035
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:21,488
Mmm... What?

1036
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:25,624
Hasn't it occurred to you
that I'm having a tough time
keeping my hands off you?

1037
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,641
- Oh, you should see your face.
- What's the matter with it?

1038
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,370
It's lovely.

1039
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,378
Ohh.

1040
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:41,107
Now what's the trouble?

1041
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:44,346
I'm not hungry anymore.
Isn't it glorious?

1042
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:48,422
- Adam!
- It's all right. Come and look.

1043
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:54,554
For her Romeo came

1044
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,860
And

1045
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:02,666
It was closing night

1046
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:06,299
The ending of

1047
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:09,309
- You don't look so bad in this light.

1048
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,811
Why do you think
I brought you here?

1049
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,246
Maybe you wanted me
to see the kind of work...

1050
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:16,250
the competition was turning out.

1051
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,252
Pretty good, huh?

1052
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,255
I taught them
everything they do.

1053
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:25,521
Oh, did they do that kind of thing
way back in your day?

1054
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,529
Sure. How do you think
I got here?

1055
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,725
I hear it still

1056
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,734
I always will

1057
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:36,737
- Not allowed to kiss back, huh?
- Oh, no.

1058
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:40,241
Doctor said it was bad
for my thermostat. Mm-hmm.

1059
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:49,383
Charade

1060
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:57,218
Well, when you come on
you come on, don't you?

1061
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,453
Well, come on.

1062
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,912
Yeah. Huh?

1063
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,916
In the lobby?

1064
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,756
Are you out of your mind?

1065
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,758
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1066
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,428
You mean it?

1067
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,430
Ah-choo!

1068
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,332
All right. All right, I'll
be right down. Wait a minute.

1069
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:21,002
H... H-Hey,
turn on the lights!

1070
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:31,077
Hey, how do you
stop this thing?

1071
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:34,246
Ah-choo!

1072
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:37,052
Ah-choo! Ah-choo!

1073
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,457
Aaaaaah!

1074
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:54,074
Three of them, all in their pyjamas?
C'est ridicule.

1075
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:56,576
What is it,
some new American fad?

1076
01:21:56,645 --> 01:22:00,308
And now your friend who lives here,
uh, the one from Texas,

1077
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:02,543
he has disappeared
into thin air.

1078
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:05,450
- Where is he?
- I wish I knew.

1079
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,647
Madame?

1080
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:13,088
Tell me, Mr. Dyle.
Where were you at 3:30 a.m.?

1081
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:15,561
In my room, asleep.

1082
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,996
- And you, Mrs. Lampert?
- I was too.

1083
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,330
In Mr. Dyle's room?

1084
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,336
No, in my room.

1085
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:25,930
Obviously
you're telling the truth,

1086
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:29,238
for why would you invent
such a ridiculous story?

1087
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:34,206
And if I were you,
I wouldn't stay in my pyjamas.

1088
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,216
Good night.

1089
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:41,113
Well, that wraps it up.
Tex has the money.

1090
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:45,125
- I'll let you know when I've found him.
- You're gonna go looking for him now?

1091
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,526
If the police find him first,
they're not going to turn over
that quarter of a million to us.

1092
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:51,861
- Oh, Adam...
- Go to bed and bolt your door.

1093
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,075
- Yeah?
- Now you listen to me, Dyle.

1094
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:05,442
I know who's got that money, man,
and I want my share.

1095
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,447
Seems to be growin' every day.

1096
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,211
Well, I ain't disappearin'
till I get it.

1097
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:12,617
- Where are you, Tex?
- Come on, man.

1098
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:16,248
Look, my mama didn't raise
no stupid children.

1099
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,258
I'll tell you what.

1100
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,260
You wanna find me,

1101
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,262
you just look over your shoulder,

1102
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,265
'cause from now on
I'm gonna be right behind you.

1103
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,577
Open up.

1104
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:46,253
- I think I was wrong
about Tex having the money.
- Why?

1105
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:49,256
I just heard from him.
He's still hungry.

1106
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:52,259
That means killing Gideon
didn't get it for him.

1107
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:55,524
So he's narrowed it down to us.
You've got it.

1108
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:58,031
But I've looked everywhere.
You know I have.

1109
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:00,033
Where's the airlines bag?

1110
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:02,626
- In the wardrobe.
- Get it.

1111
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,638
Lord, you're obstinate.

1112
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:07,800
Charles must have had it with him
on the train when Tex killed him.

1113
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,810
Thanks.

1114
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:14,306
Everybody and his Aunt Lillian's
been through that bag,

1115
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,316
including me.

1116
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,319
- Okay, we'll do it again.
- I've been into it at least once a day.

1117
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,321
Somebody would have seen it.

1118
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:26,691
It's there, Reggie.
We're looking at it right now.

1119
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:29,355
Something on that bed is worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

1120
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,958
- But what?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1121
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:35,400
Four passports. No.

1122
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,406
Steamship ticket.

1123
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:43,176
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

1124
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:45,178
Wallet.

1125
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,682
Comb? No.

1126
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,685
A fountain pen.

1127
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,757
What about that key?

1128
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:58,759
To the apartment.
Matches mine exactly.

1129
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,761
Well...

1130
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:04,688
I bet you don't
really need those.

1131
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,934
You need them.

1132
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:12,773
This still doesn't make sense,

1133
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,833
but it isn't worth a quarter
of a million dollars either.

1134
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:20,107
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1135
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:22,376
- The tooth powder.
- What about it?

1136
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:26,216
Could you recognize heroin
just by the taste of it?

1137
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,021
Heroin.

1138
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:35,221
- Peppermint-flavored heroin.
- Mmm.

1139
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,766
Well, I guess that's it.

1140
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,767
Dead end.

1141
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:44,271
Well, go to bed. You've gotta
go to work in the morning.

1142
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:46,739
There's nothing more
we can do tonight.

1143
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,072
I love you, Adam.

1144
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,479
Yes, you told me.

1145
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:56,142
No. The last time I said,
"I love you, Alex."

1146
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:58,151
Oh.

1147
01:25:58,219 --> 01:26:00,380
Oh.

1148
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,664
- Hold it. They're
recognizing Great Britain.
- Ooh, la vache.

1149
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,897
Mr. Chairman,
fellow delegates...

1150
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:19,565
and my distinguished
colleague from Italy.

1151
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:23,839
Her Majesty's delegation has
listened with great patience
to the Southern European...

1152
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:26,346
- Oh, are you on?
- No, it's all right.
What's wrong, Adam?

1153
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:28,348
Nothing.
I think I've found something.

1154
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:31,351
I was snooping around Tex's room
and came across this in the wastebasket.

1155
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,353
I stuck it together again.

1156
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:35,855
That's the receipt Grandpierre
gave me for Charles' things.

1157
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:38,859
- I don't see how that's going to...
- No, you're not looking.

1158
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:41,987
When we went through the airlines bag,
something was missing... an agenda.

1159
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:44,759
That's an appointment book,
isn't it? It wasn't there.

1160
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,834
That's right.

1161
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,836
I remember Grandpierre
looking through it,

1162
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:52,839
but there was nothing in it the police
thought was very important.

1163
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:54,841
Can you remember anything in it?

1164
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:58,345
Well, it did say something
about Charles' last appointment.

1165
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:00,347
With who? Where?

1166
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:03,350
- I think it only said where.
- Come on, Reggie, think.

1167
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,352
This may be
what we're looking for.

1168
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,355
Adam, that money
doesn't belong to us.

1169
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:11,358
- If we keep it,
we'll be breaking the law.
- Nonsense. We didn't steal it.

1170
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:14,486
- There's no law against
stealing stolen money.
- Of course there is!

1171
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:17,793
There is? When did they pass
such a silly law? Now think, Reggie.

1172
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:19,799
What was in
that appointment book?

1173
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,801
A place or street corner
or something.

1174
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:23,700
Watch it. I'm on.

1175
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,680
...of, of the Western
hemisphere conference...

1176
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,381
...of the Western
hemisphere conference...

1177
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,393
held on March 22...

1178
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:49,294
No, wait!
It was last Thursday, 5:00.

1179
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:51,696
Jardin des Champs Elysees.

1180
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,700
That's it, Adam! The garden!

1181
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:57,033
Well, it's Thursday today,
and it's almost 5:00, so come on.

1182
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,040
It's all right, gentlemen.
Carry on.

1183
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,170
Now what?

1184
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:08,113
5:00, Thursday, the gardens.

1185
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:10,116
Must be something around here.

1186
01:28:10,184 --> 01:28:12,118
Charles' appointment
was last week.

1187
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:15,383
- Yes, I know, but this
is all we've got left.
- You're not kidding.

1188
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:17,890
Ten minutes ago I had a job.

1189
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,894
Now you've got another job,
so stop grumbling and start looking.

1190
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:23,897
I'll take that side.
You poke around over here.

1191
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:06,003
It's hopeless. I don't even know
what we're looking for.

1192
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:08,372
I don't think Tex does either.

1193
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:11,071
- Tex? Is he here?
- Look.

1194
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:19,342
I'm going to see what he's up to.
You stay here.

1195
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:22,355
Be careful, Adam.
He's already killed three men.

1196
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,024
Wait! Wait!

1197
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,026
Taxi!

1198
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,028
Back up.

1199
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:55,945
All right, where's the letter?

1200
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:59,612
The letter, huh?
It ain't worth nothin'.

1201
01:30:59,687 --> 01:31:02,622
You know what I mean.
The envelope with the stamps on it.

1202
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:04,624
I want it.

1203
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,559
You greenhorn.

1204
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:12,224
Why, you thick-skulled,
harebrained, half-witted greenhorn.

1205
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,167
And they was both
too smart for us.

1206
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:18,967
- What are you talking about?
- First her husband, now her?

1207
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,975
She batted all of them
big eyes at you...

1208
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:25,979
and you fell for it
like an egg from a tall chicken.

1209
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:28,311
You want the envelope?

1210
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:31,647
There. You take it.
It's all yours.

1211
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,987
You killed all three of 'em
for nothin'!

1212
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:42,162
You greenhorn!

1213
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:45,222
You blockheaded jackass!

1214
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:47,665
You are a nincompoop!

1215
01:31:50,872 --> 01:31:52,806
Sylvie!
What are you doing here?

1216
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:55,138
I'm waiting for Jean-Louis.

1217
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:57,143
Oh. What's he up to?

1218
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:00,442
He was so excited when he got
the stamps you gave him this morning.

1219
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,416
- He said he'd never seen any like them.
- I'm glad.

1220
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:05,418
- What's all this?
- The stamp market.

1221
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:07,454
It's there
every Thursday afternoon.

1222
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:09,820
That's where Jean-Louis
trades his stamps.

1223
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:13,819
- Good Lord, where is he?
- What's the matter, cherie?

1224
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:16,159
The stamps!
They're worth a fortune!

1225
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,960
- What?
- A fortune! Come on!

1226
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:29,242
- Oh, I don't see him anywhere.
- We'll separate.

1227
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,403
- You look over there.
- Okay.

1228
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:37,340
Jean-Louis!

1229
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:41,312
Jean-Louis!

1230
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,823
- Jean-Louis!

1231
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:53,165
Jean-Louis!

1232
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,168
Jean-Louis.

1233
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,171
Reggie! Reggie!

1234
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:04,010
Jean-Louis, thank heaven.
Do you have the...

1235
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:09,315
- What's this?
- A man gave me all those for only three.

1236
01:33:09,383 --> 01:33:13,046
A man? Oh, no, Jean-Louis.
Who? Where?

1237
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:17,923
Vite, mon cheri. Vite.

1238
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:20,821
- La-bas.
- Come on!

1239
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:27,767
- Oh, but he's gone.
- I don't blame him.

1240
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:30,235
- Entrez.

1241
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:34,070
- Monsieur Felix?
- Oui.

1242
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:39,340
I was expecting you.
I knew you would come.

1243
01:33:39,413 --> 01:33:41,347
Look at them, madame.

1244
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:45,112
Have you ever, in your entire life,
seen anything so beautiful?

1245
01:33:45,186 --> 01:33:48,121
I'm sorry. I don't know
anything about stamps.

1246
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:52,523
I know them as one knows his own face,
though I had never seen them.

1247
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:54,891
This one,
a Swedish four shilling...

1248
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:57,055
called
Da Gula Fyraskillingen,

1249
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,065
printed in 1854.

1250
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:02,432
- What is it worth?
- Oh, the money is unimportant.

1251
01:34:02,503 --> 01:34:04,698
I'm afraid it's very important.

1252
01:34:04,772 --> 01:34:08,037
Well, in your money,
perhaps $85,000.

1253
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:11,044
- May I sit down?
- Yes.

1254
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:14,275
- And the blue one?
- Oh, it's called The Hawaiian Blue.

1255
01:34:14,348 --> 01:34:17,476
In 1894 the owner was murdered
by a rival collector...

1256
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,485
who was obsessed to own it.

1257
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:21,544
And what is its value today?

1258
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:24,216
Sixty-five thousand.

1259
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,818
- And the last one.
- Ah, the best for last.

1260
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:31,387
Le chef d'oeuvre de la collection.
The masterpiece.

1261
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:34,229
The most valuable stamp
in the world.

1262
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:36,235
It's called the Gazette Maldave.

1263
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:38,737
It was printed by hand
on colored paper...

1264
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:41,240
and marked with the initials
of the printer.

1265
01:34:41,308 --> 01:34:45,938
Today it has a value of $100000.

1266
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:48,504
I'm not a thief, madame.

1267
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:50,516
I knew there was some mistake.

1268
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:57,523
You gave the boy
a great many stamps in return.

1269
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:59,525
- Are they for sale now?
- Let me see.

1270
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:02,084
Three hundred and fifty European;
two hundred Asian;

1271
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:05,098
a hundred and seventy-five American;
a hundred African;

1272
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:08,101
and 12 Princess Grace
commemorative.

1273
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:10,137
Which comes to ten francs.

1274
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:14,771
And don't forget these.

1275
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,969
Thank you.

1276
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:18,978
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

1277
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:23,210
For a few minutes they were mine.
That is enough.

1278
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:30,690
Adam? Adam?

1279
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:15,534
- Hello?
- Mr. Bartholomew?

1280
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,537
Yes.

1281
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:19,698
Tex is dead. Smothered.

1282
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:26,435
And Adam did it.
He killed them all.

1283
01:36:26,514 --> 01:36:30,177
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1284
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:33,550
Tex wrote the word "Dyle"
before he died.

1285
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:38,091
He's the murderer,
I tell you.

1286
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:41,856
Wait a minute, Mrs. Lampert.
You'd better give that to me again.

1287
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:45,365
It was the stamps on the letter
Charles had with him on the train.

1288
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:48,868
They were in plain view all the time,
but no one looked at the envelope.

1289
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:52,269
Mrs. Lampert, listen to me. You're not
safe as long as you have these stamps.

1290
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:56,070
Let's see. Do you know the center garden
at the Palais Royale?

1291
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:58,634
- The colonnade?
- Yes, by the colonnade.

1292
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:03,649
- As fast as you can get there.
Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
- I'm leaving right away.

1293
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:20,558
Reggie! The stamps!
Where are they? Reggie! Wait!

1294
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:23,831
So you can kill me too? Tex is dead.
He wrote "Dyle" on the carpet.

1295
01:37:23,904 --> 01:37:27,396
- I'm not Dyle. You know that.
- But Tex didn't know it.
You're a murderer.

1296
01:37:27,474 --> 01:37:29,408
Reggie, I want those stamps!

1297
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:32,411
- Palais Royale, vite.
- Mais je suis occupe.

1298
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,640
- Mais c'est tres urgent.
- Occupe.

1299
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,652
Whoa! Billet!

1300
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:16,575
Ohh!

1301
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,267
American Embassy.

1302
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:43,769
American Embassy?

1303
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:47,796
Uh, Mr. Bartholomew's office,
please.

1304
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:51,811
- Would you speak
a little louder, please.
- I can't speak any louder.

1305
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:54,370
Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew.

1306
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:56,882
I'm sorry. Mr. Bartholomew
has left for the day.

1307
01:40:56,950 --> 01:41:00,784
But someone's
trying to kill me.

1308
01:41:00,854 --> 01:41:03,288
- What?
- Kill me!

1309
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:06,292
You've got to get word
to him right away.

1310
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:09,523
He's in the center garden
of the Palais Royale near the colonnade.

1311
01:41:09,596 --> 01:41:12,929
Tell him I'm trapped in a phone booth
right below him in the Metro station.

1312
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,865
The name's Lampert.

1313
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:01,210
- Hello?
- Hello. Mr. Bartholomew?

1314
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:04,444
- Yes.
- There was a call for you
just now, Mr. Bartholomew.

1315
01:42:04,518 --> 01:42:07,043
It sounded quite urgent.
A Mrs. Lampert.

1316
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:10,215
Lampert? I don't know
any Mrs. Lampert.

1317
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:14,056
She says she's trapped
in a Metro station and
someone's trying to kill her.

1318
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:19,065
Trying to kill her?
Who does she think I am, the C.I.A.?

1319
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:22,068
All right, I guess you'd better
call the French police.

1320
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:17,312
Mr. Bartholomew!
Mr. Bartholomew! Help me!

1321
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:19,916
Reggie! Stop!

1322
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:22,928
That man is Carson Dyle.

1323
01:43:24,131 --> 01:43:26,964
We all know Carson Dyle
is dead, Mrs. Lampert.

1324
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:30,162
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.
- Now, you're not gonna believe him.

1325
01:43:30,237 --> 01:43:33,104
Bring those stamps over here.
He's trying to trick you again.

1326
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:37,109
Tex recognized him.
That's why he wrote Dyle.

1327
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:40,476
- If you take him those stamps,
he'll kill you too.
- Mrs. Lampert!

1328
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:44,608
If I'm who he says I am,
what's preventing me from
killing you right now?

1329
01:43:44,685 --> 01:43:48,348
Because he'd have to come out to get the
stamps, and he knows he'd never make it.

1329
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:51,357
Mrs. Lampert, he wants the money
for himself.

1330
01:43:51,425 --> 01:43:53,450
That's all he's ever wanted.

1331
01:43:53,527 --> 01:43:57,293
- He's with the C.I.A.
I saw him at the embassy.
- I tell you, he's Carson Dyle.

1332
01:43:57,364 --> 01:43:59,628
That's right, Mrs. Lampert.
That's right.

1333
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,793
I'm a dead man. Look at me.

1334
01:44:05,372 --> 01:44:07,806
Oh, I don't know who anybody is.

1335
01:44:07,874 --> 01:44:10,206
Reggie, I beg you.

1336
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:12,211
Just trust me once more.

1337
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:14,474
Why should I?

1338
01:44:14,548 --> 01:44:17,745
I can't think of a reason
in the world why you should.

1339
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:26,322
Stop, Mrs. Lampert,
or I'll kill you!

1340
01:44:26,393 --> 01:44:28,327
It won't get you the stamps, Dyle.

1341
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:31,762
You'll still have to come out, and I'm
not likely to miss at this range.

1342
01:44:31,832 --> 01:44:34,767
Maybe not, but it takes
a lot of bullets to kill me.

1343
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:37,770
They left me there with five
in my legs and my stomach.

1344
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:40,773
They knew I was alive,
but they left me there.

1345
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:43,537
I spent ten months in a German prison
camp with nothing to stop the pain.

1346
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:46,238
They left me there.
They deserved to die.

1347
01:44:46,313 --> 01:44:50,079
- But I had nothing to do with it.
- You've got the money now.
It belongs to me.

1348
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:53,847
Mrs. Lampert, they knew I was
still alive, but they left me there.

1349
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,185
That's why I had to kill them,
all four of them.

1350
01:44:57,257 --> 01:45:00,693
Please believe me. I'll kill you too.
It won't make any difference.

1351
01:45:02,429 --> 01:45:05,592
It's no use.
You're running out of time.

1352
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:09,193
I've come too far to turn back.
I swear, I'll kill you!

1353
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:14,098
Make up your mind,
Mrs. Lampert. Now.

1354
01:45:15,042 --> 01:45:16,907
- Adam!

1355
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:39,677
- All right.

1356
01:47:39,753 --> 01:47:42,847
I know you're in there,
Mrs. Lampert. Come on out.

1357
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:02,407
Do you hear me? Come on out!

1358
01:48:14,721 --> 01:48:18,213
I don't want to kill you,
but I will.

1359
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:24,793
Come on out.

1360
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:03,668
The game is over, Mrs. Lampert.

1361
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:16,615
Aaaaah!

1362
01:49:36,102 --> 01:49:39,629
You didn't have to
chase me so hard.

1363
01:49:39,706 --> 01:49:42,641
- That one's done. Do this one.
- Oh.

1364
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:45,644
I'm sorry I thought
you were the murderer,

1365
01:49:45,712 --> 01:49:49,148
but how was I to know he was
as big a liar as you are?

1366
01:49:49,215 --> 01:49:52,150
Is that all the gratitude I get
for saving your hide?

1367
01:49:52,218 --> 01:49:54,152
Rub your own blinking foot.

1368
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,814
The truth: Was it my hide,
or those stamps?

1369
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:59,825
What a terrible thing to say.
How could you think that?

1370
01:49:59,893 --> 01:50:01,827
Then prove it to me.

1371
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:05,831
Tell me to go to the embassy first thing
in the morning and turn in those stamps.

1372
01:50:07,701 --> 01:50:11,637
- I said, tell me to go
to the embassy first...
- I heard you, I heard you.

1373
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:13,570
Then say it.

1374
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:17,235
Now, Reggie, listen to me.
There's something I'd like to explain.

1375
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:19,244
Never mind.
I'll go by myself.

1376
01:50:19,312 --> 01:50:21,246
What makes you think
they're even interested?

1377
01:50:21,314 --> 01:50:25,011
It's only a quarter million.
It'll cost more than that for
them to fix their bookkeeping.

1378
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:26,677
Now, as a taxpayer...

1379
01:50:26,753 --> 01:50:29,688
Who's a taxpayer?
Crooks don't pay taxes.

1380
01:50:29,756 --> 01:50:31,690
- Excuse me, soldier...
- Marine, ma'am.

1381
01:50:31,758 --> 01:50:36,024
Forgive me. Who would I see regarding
the return of stolen government money?

1382
01:50:36,096 --> 01:50:38,030
You might try
the Treasury Department.

1383
01:50:38,098 --> 01:50:40,259
Room 217, second floor,
Mr. Cruikshank.

1384
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:42,699
217. Thank you, marine.

1385
01:50:48,742 --> 01:50:51,677
Uh, do you mind if I don't
go in with you?

1386
01:50:51,745 --> 01:50:55,681
The sight of all that money being
given away might make me break out.

1387
01:50:58,018 --> 01:51:00,953
Mr. Cruikshank, please.
My name is Lampert.

1388
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:02,955
Yes.

1389
01:51:03,023 --> 01:51:05,958
- Mr. Cruikshank? A Miss Lamp...
- Mrs.

1390
01:51:06,026 --> 01:51:08,153
Mrs. Lampert to see you.

1391
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:10,492
- Yes, sir. Go right in.
- Thank you.

1392
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:24,408
Of all the mean,

1393
01:51:24,477 --> 01:51:26,411
rotten,

1394
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:29,243
contemptible, crooked...

1395
01:51:29,315 --> 01:51:32,682
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad
to find out I'm not crooked.

1396
01:51:32,752 --> 01:51:35,152
You can't even be honest
about being dishonest.

1397
01:51:35,221 --> 01:51:37,155
Why didn't you say something?

1398
01:51:37,223 --> 01:51:40,920
- We're not allowed to tell.
Come on, give me the stamps.
- Mm-mmm.

1399
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:45,991
Wait. How did Dyle get
an office in this building?

1400
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:49,331
- When did you meet him?
What time of day, I mean.
- About 1:00.

1401
01:51:49,402 --> 01:51:52,838
The lunch hour. Probably
worked it out in advance.

1402
01:51:52,906 --> 01:51:56,273
Found an office usually left open
and moved in for the time you were here.

1403
01:51:56,342 --> 01:51:59,937
Then how do I know
this is your office?

1404
01:52:00,013 --> 01:52:04,712
Mrs. Foster, take a memo to Bartholomew
in Security recommending...

1405
01:52:04,784 --> 01:52:07,048
Bartholomew!

1406
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,021
Recommending that embassy offices
be kept locked during the lunch hour.

1407
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,524
Mmm. Starting with his own.

1408
01:52:12,592 --> 01:52:15,459
- Give me the stamps. Come on.
- What's your first name today?

1409
01:52:15,528 --> 01:52:17,462
- Brian.
- Brian Cruikshank.

1410
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:20,465
Serves me right
if I get stuck with that one.

1411
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:23,468
- Who asked you to
get stuck with any of them?
- Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

1412
01:52:23,536 --> 01:52:25,470
- Yes.
- But we're divorced.

1413
01:52:25,538 --> 01:52:27,369
No.

1414
01:52:28,441 --> 01:52:30,375
Oh.

1415
01:52:32,212 --> 01:52:33,975
My mother.
She lives in Detroit.

1416
01:52:34,047 --> 01:52:37,483
You'd like her. She'd like you too.
Come on, give me those stamps.

1417
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:40,644
Not until you prove to me
that you're really Brian Cruikshank.

1418
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:44,019
Next week I'll put it on
a marriage license. How about that?

1419
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:46,024
Quit stalling.
I want some identification now.

1420
01:52:46,092 --> 01:52:49,994
- I wouldn't lie on a license.
- You can't prove it.
You're still trying to...

1421
01:52:50,063 --> 01:52:52,497
"Marriage license"?

1422
01:52:52,565 --> 01:52:54,999
Did you say
"marriage license"?

1423
01:52:55,068 --> 01:52:58,003
Don't change the subject.
Just give me the stamps.

1424
01:52:58,071 --> 01:53:02,667
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter,
Brian, whatever your name is.

1425
01:53:02,742 --> 01:53:04,676
Oh, I love you.

1426
01:53:04,744 --> 01:53:06,678
I hope we have a lot of boys.

1427
01:53:06,746 --> 01:53:08,680
We can name them all after you.

1428
01:53:08,748 --> 01:53:11,683
Well, before we start that,
may I have the stamps?
