Benoit Blanc: A donut hole in the donut's hole. But we must look a little closer. And when we do, we see that the donut hole has a hole in its center - it is not a donut hole at all but a smaller donut with its own hole, and our donut is not whole at all!
Benoit Blanc: It's a weird case from the start. A case with a hole in the center. A donut.
Benoit Blanc: I suspect foul play. I have eliminated no suspects
Marta Cabrera: I've never been to a will reading before.
Benoit Blanc: You'd think it'd be like a game show, but think of a community production of a tax return.
Benoit Blanc: You have a regurgitative reaction to mistruths.
Ransom Drysdale: That's some heavy-duty conjecture.
Walt Thrombey: Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral, but you're early for the will reading.
Ransom Drysdale: Up your ass.
Meg Thrombey: Oh, very nice!
Ransom Drysdale: Matter of fact, eat shit. How's that?
Ransom Drysdale: Eat shit, eat shit, eat shit... *definitely* eat shit...
Ransom Drysdale: I got to do this more often.
Benoit Blanc: This is a twisted web, and we are not finished untangling it, not yet.
Ransom Drysdale: What is this, CSI: KFC?
Lieutenant Elliott: That... was the dumbest car chase of all time.
Ransom Drysdale: This might be the best thing that has ever happened to you. My mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Benoit Blanc: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to request that you all stay until the investigation is completed.
Linda Drysdale: What?
Joni Thrombey: Can we ask why? Has something changed?
Benoit Blanc: No...
Joni Thrombey: No, it hasn't changed, or no, we can't ask?
Marta Cabrera: You're not much of a detective, are you?
Benoit Blanc: Well, to be fair, you make a pretty lousy murderer.
Marta Cabrera: What was that about will readings being boring?
Benoit Blanc: The exception that proves the rule.
Benoit Blanc: The game is afoot. Eh, Watson?
Linda Drysdale: We are the Thrombeys, goddamnit! This is still our house!
Greatnana Wanetta: Ransom? Is that you again?
