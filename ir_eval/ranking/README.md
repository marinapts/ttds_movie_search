## Install dependencies
The first time you clone the project, run `python3 -m venv .env` which creates a virtual environment
using the command venv and stores all the dependencies under the folder .env.

Run the following to ensure that all of us are using the same versions of Python packages.
Activate the virtual environment on the project's folder and then install the packages from requirements.txt

```bash
source ./.env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
