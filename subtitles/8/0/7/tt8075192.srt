2
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:36,137
Hey.

3
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,806
SHOPLIFTERS

4
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,605
Five croquettes, please.

5
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:12,191
Five croquettes, sure.
That'll be 450 yen.

6
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,528
- How much?
- 450 yen.

7
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,407
A crusher...

8
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:23,161
is shaped like a hammer.

9
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,957
One blow with that thing
shatters any glass to bits.

10
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:30,085
How much is it?

11
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,254
About 2,000 yen.

12
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:34,965
Expensive.

13
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,718
- If you buy it.
- Here you go.

14
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,597
Tasty.

15
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:47,476
That store makes
the best croquettes.

16
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,813
You're right.

17
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,525
Man, it's cold.

18
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,070
- What?
- I forgot shampoo.

19
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,782
Let's get it the next time.
It's so cold.

20
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,122
Feels like it's going to snow.

21
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,581
Yeah.

22
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,886
She's there again.

23
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,766
Say...

24
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,103
What's wrong?

25
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:34,899
Where's your mommy?

26
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,360
Hey, let's go.

27
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:39,987
They'll get cold.

28
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,698
But, she's...

29
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,163
Say, want to eat a croquette?

30
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,458
Want to eat a croquette?

31
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,510
Can't you bring home
something to make us money?

32
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,139
Your husband isn't good
at sniffing out profits.

33
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,060
Shota, where's the shampoo?

34
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,435
I forgot.

35
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:12,937
Got a name?

36
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,399
What?

37
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,901
It's Yuri.

38
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,946
How do you write Yuri?

39
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,529
How old?

40
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,825
Pre-school.

41
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,537
- She's so frail.
- Your nail's flying.

42
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,415
After you've fed her,
take her home.

43
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,586
It's so cold out.
I'll take her home tomorrow.

44
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,048
No, we're not a foster home.

45
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,468
But look, we've got our very own
guardian angel here.

46
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,387
Don't point your chopsticks.

47
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,763
Ping!

48
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,767
That's disgusting, Grandma!

49
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,686
Your spit's flying everywhere.

50
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,899
I told you not to throw your
nails in the entryway.

51
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,651
Eat another one?

52
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,153
You live off my pension
but you're so unreliable.

53
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,446
Shut up.

54
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,036
You're so skinny.

55
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,288
Let's have a look at your arm.

56
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,915
What happened here?

57
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,458
I fell.

58
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,879
Does it hurt?

59
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,464
Let's have a better look at you.

60
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,219
You're covered in scars.

61
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,979
Take her home
before the cops get here.

62
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:40,692
She's right, can't get involved.

63
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,986
Grandma,
your noodles will get cold.

64
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,661
- Straight?
- No, right, right.

65
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,203
Here.

66
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,833
Hey, hey.

67
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,418
Is she asleep?

68
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:02,004
She got a good deal.
She ate three croquettes.

69
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,548
Ring the bell?

70
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,927
No, no,
put her down by the door.

71
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,472
She'll freeze to death.

72
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,098
In that case...

73
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,562
Put her down,
ring the bell and run?

74
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,189
Like Santa Claus?

75
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,322
That's what you always say!
You're never here!

76
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,076
- I told you.
- I'm the one looking after her!

77
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,493
I'll go take a look.

78
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,703
You get her?

79
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,001
Hell knows
who the real father is.

80
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:44,964
- Don't!
- Shut up!

81
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,259
That hurts! Why?

82
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,346
I didn't want to
have her either!

83
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,848
Now's our chance.

84
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,560
Hey.

85
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:18,998
It's cold.

86
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,167
So cold.

87
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,463
She wet the bed.

88
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,800
Stinks.

89
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:37,225
Say you're sorry.

90
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,851
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,061
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,023
I'm sorry.

93
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,191
That's enough.
Shhh, be quiet.

94
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,818
We should have
taken her home last night.

95
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,194
Maybe.

96
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,907
Hey, those are mine.

97
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,116
But they don't fit you anymore.

98
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,952
- Where's my belt?
- OK, raise both arms.

99
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,292
It's so cold today,
I should take the day off.

100
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,086
Send an email saying
I caught a cold.

101
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,338
Here's your belt.

102
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,385
He's going out.

103
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,431
I'm just pouring it now.

104
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,890
Wait a minute.

105
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,060
Oh, throw that out.

106
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,812
Here you are, here.

107
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:27,984
Ouch!

108
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,201
Your nail, bad luck.

109
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,536
Oh, my nail.

110
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,146
It's all garbage.

111
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,572
Another one ran away.

112
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,574
It was Koga.

113
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,329
No, he sent an email
saying, "I quit."

114
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,877
He was useless anyway.

115
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,587
When I see him,
I'll beat him up.

116
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,812
Show me your arm.

117
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,114
Many scars.

118
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,993
The pain went away,
went away already.

119
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,329
Now, the other side.

120
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,455
Hello!

121
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,833
I'm Yoneyama,
here to check up on you!

122
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,293
Coming.

123
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,629
Hatsue, are you there?

124
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,505
Hey, this girl...

125
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,465
Coming!

126
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,762
Coming.

127
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,686
Oh, hello there, I'm Yoneyama.

128
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,653
The other side.

129
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,404
This way? Sure.

130
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,162
Hello, excuse me.

131
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,225
Your neighbor Kaneko...

132
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,104
finally moved into an apartment.

133
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,317
Even though she had
three grown kids.

134
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,029
So that's why I haven't seen her
around recently.

135
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,617
Hatsue, you should talk things
over with your son.

136
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,495
Does he live in Hakata?

137
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,414
Did some real estate agent
send you here?

138
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,875
No, no.

139
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,754
I know how hard it is...

140
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,632
for an old person to live alone.

141
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,471
How much money are you making
to move me out of here?

142
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,268
That's all in the past.

143
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,394
I don't flip properties anymore.

144
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:08,347
Only kids who can't study
at home go to school.

145
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:17,231
YAMATOYA

146
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,870
Hey, mister.

147
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,375
I need a pack of cigarettes.

148
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,170
- It's getting so cold.
- It's cold.

149
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,923
I want Wakaba.

150
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,469
320 yen.

151
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,379
The baby doesn't look like
either of them.

152
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,341
Plastic surgery?

153
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,634
The father could be anyone.

154
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,595
She used to be a call girl.

155
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,304
But she's hiding it,

156
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,558
- pretending she's lousy in bed.
- Amazing.

157
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,937
This is for helping me out
this morning.

158
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,774
You don't have to,
we help each other.

159
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,192
- I'd like a drink, too.
- I'd like a hot lemon.

160
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,487
I'm not treating you guys.

161
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,199
What was it? A fever?

162
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,870
Mumps, from the other kids
at pre-school.

163
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,002
Do you have mumps, too?

164
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,714
Hey, I don't have mumps.

165
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,509
I'll catch it, too.

166
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,677
Oh, no.

167
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,929
- Hey, you already...
- Caught it?

168
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,180
I caught it?

169
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,675
I'm home.

170
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,100
Hey, Shota.

171
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,162
How did you get hurt?

172
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,624
I fell.

173
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,293
You got burned.

174
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,588
Who did it to you?

175
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,343
Your mom?

176
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,554
My mom is nice.

177
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,972
She buys me clothes, too.

178
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,144
Then what were you
doing outside?

179
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,788
What will you do?

180
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,499
Go back to your home?

181
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,641
I took the shampoo.

182
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,353
Merit Shampoo.

183
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,523
- Yamatoya only has Merit.
- Merit smells bad...

184
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,857
Don't be so picky.

185
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,572
Hey, it looks like
we kidnapped her.

186
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,782
No, it doesn't.

187
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,703
We're not confining her and we
haven't asked for a ransom.

188
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,038
That's not the point.

189
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:46,000
They haven't reported her
missing to the police?

190
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,587
I bet they're relieved
she's gone.

191
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,090
It's all Chinese cabbage.

192
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,094
Chinese cabbage is good for you.

193
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,430
It absorbs the meat broth.

194
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,432
The gluten cake is cooked.

195
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,643
What? Gluten cake?

196
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,313
Look.

197
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,984
You like gluten cake?

198
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,321
Come over here.

199
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,788
It's hot.

200
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,379
Is that tasty?

201
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,883
Have you eaten it before?

202
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,471
With whom?

203
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,641
Grandma.

204
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,686
There's more.

205
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,232
If you feed her too much,
she'll wet the bed again.

206
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,818
She can sleep in my bed.

207
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,820
No, I sleep with Grandma.

208
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,366
This...

209
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,327
What?

210
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,913
Hold out your hand.

211
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,248
Salt?

212
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:10,418
This keeps you from
wetting the bed.

213
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,380
Go ahead, lick it.

214
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,007
It's salty.

215
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,761
She licked it, licked it.
That's how we used to cure it.

216
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,222
Sounds fishy to me.

217
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,392
- I swear it's true.
- She's licking it.

218
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,605
He's home.

219
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,446
It's cold, Shota.

220
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,740
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

221
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,451
Hey, please close it.

222
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,037
This is fine, here.

223
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,248
He's hurt!

224
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,292
On crutches!

225
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,336
Is he drunk?

226
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,631
I'm fine now.
I'm all good, no, no.

227
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,051
Shota, you made such a mess.

228
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,305
Make some tea.

229
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,432
This room is fine.

230
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,309
Her nail was a bad omen,

231
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,644
but you forced me to go to work.

232
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,108
What is this? You can't work
for about a month?

233
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,359
Even day laborers get
workers' compensation, right?

234
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,361
- Well, probably...
- Really?

235
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,613
Really?

236
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,948
So, it would be better
if you broke it,

237
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,408
rather than cracked it?

238
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,204
Stop joking around. I thought
I was going to die, ouch!

239
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,039
You get compensation?

240
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,211
Oh, thank you.

241
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,964
She's cute.

242
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,798
- Grandma?
- The other one.

243
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,176
- My wife's sister.
- Different mothers.

244
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,137
So, you have a family.

245
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,431
I thought you were single.

246
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:48,933
I hear that a lot.

247
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,289
I'll teach you how, someday.

248
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,384
This is your favorite,
gluten cake.

249
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,013
Was your grandma nice?

250
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,644
Did you live with her?

251
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,940
Now she's in heaven.

252
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,155
Then forget about her.

253
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,290
Sorry to keep you waiting.

254
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,165
Thank you so much.

255
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,505
Enter your code now.

256
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,467
1192, everybody knows
the year of the Kamakura regime.

257
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,138
Just say it in your head.

258
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,805
I am.

259
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,642
No, you're not.
No one else should find out.

260
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,317
What does MVK stand for?

261
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:22,986
Male virgin killer.

262
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,070
What exactly do you do?

263
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,780
Well...

264
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,577
You wear a knit dress that
shows your sideboob a little.

265
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,790
Sideboob.

266
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,168
That's what's popular now?

267
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,925
It's 3,000 yen. The shop
and the girl split it 50-50.

268
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,679
How great you can get paid
just for that.

269
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,139
You're getting paid, too.

270
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,684
I get paid for damages.

271
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,188
- Damages?
- Right.

272
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,148
Your pension is?

273
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,277
Right, my pension.

274
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,570
I guess, in a way.

275
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,451
Mr. Four?

276
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:13,953
- Yeah.
- Yours.

277
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,247
I should go.

278
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,624
Was that your rice cake?

279
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,753
Why do you use Sayaka,
your sister's name?

280
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,755
What do you mean, why?

281
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,800
You're so mean.

282
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,637
Just like who?

283
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,392
Oh, good, good.

284
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,936
That's good timing.
Try it again, good.

285
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,279
That's right You've gotten
really good.

286
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,909
Yuri,
you're getting the hang of it.

287
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,165
You're late going to work today.

288
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,168
It's work-share today.

289
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,086
What is that?

290
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:08,340
They can't pay us all,
so ten of us start at noon.

291
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:14,514
So, everybody gets
a little poorer.

292
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,516
Something like that.

293
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,225
I'm not finished yet.

294
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:29,988
But no workers' compensation
is a real drag.

295
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,366
A real drag. What a waste,
being so nice to you.

296
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,038
Do you think that guy was OK?

297
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,125
He doesn't care about us.

298
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,630
He sure was good looking.

299
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,173
Hey, what's this?

300
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,595
A tie pin.

301
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,388
It's yours.

302
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,516
But it's fake.

303
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,485
Is he full-time?

304
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:11,654
Yeah.

305
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,282
So lucky to be full-time.

306
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,367
Want it?

307
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,618
Yes.

308
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:19,871
You can't have it.

309
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,211
Granny's pension is 70,000 yen
a month, right?

310
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,380
60,000 yen.

311
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,966
But lucky her,

312
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,344
she gets that 'til she dies,
because of her husband.

313
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:39,224
She talks big, like she's
actually earning that money.

314
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,600
We take care of her.

315
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,148
It's so damn cold.

316
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,026
Welcome home.

317
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,236
I'm home.

318
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,196
Welcome home, Grandma.

319
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,323
The pond at the shrine was
frozen over.

320
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,702
We can't have you slipping
and breaking your hip.

321
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,203
Where's Aki?

322
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,707
She went to go
shake her breasts.

323
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,500
- What's this?
- Sweet bean jelly.

324
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,298
You're heading out?

325
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:16,052
Hey, it's cold, you should
wear another layer.

326
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,680
Look after Yuri, Grandma.

327
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:19,931
Yes, yes.

328
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:24,477
Go ahead and fix up
whatever there is to eat.

329
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,815
Until the morning?

330
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,068
- I was up hostessing all night.
- Go to sleep.

331
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,404
- Ayu.
- Yes.

332
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,824
You're booked
for the chat room at 3:30.

333
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,451
Yay!

334
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,747
- You're raking it in.
- I have to save money.

335
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,415
- Sayaka.
- Yes.

336
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,295
A customer complained
you wear double panties.

337
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,504
Take one off.

338
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:54,382
You think you're
too good for this.

339
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,674
No, I just get cold.

340
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,344
- Harumi.
- Me?

341
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,221
No fingers in underwear here,
so watch it.

342
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,014
You could shut us all down.

343
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,142
- Right.
- Thanks.

344
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,644
You take this too seriously.

345
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,313
Shut up.

346
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,949
- You're up, Sayaka.
- Right.

347
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,000
Hello.

348
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:33,004
Is today your day off?

349
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,974
I DIDN'T GO TO WORK TODAY.

350
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,434
I played hooky today, too.

351
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:55,192
Mr. Four, you're a breast man,
not a butt man, right?

352
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,538
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE.

353
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,623
OK.

354
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,043
I'll start now.

355
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,969
- Break time.
- Right.

356
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:13,812
Excuse me.

357
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,902
I'd like to catch a sea bass.

358
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:22,239
What's the difference between
a plug and a pencil popper?

359
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:24,658
I'll show you
the pencil poppers.

360
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:27,786
There are so many,
it's confusing.

361
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:28,953
Happy to help.

362
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,749
A plug is the generic name
for plastic fishing lures.

363
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,662
That worked out great, right?

364
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,664
Yuri, you did a great job, too!

365
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,500
Yay!

366
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:18,753
In those situations,

367
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:24,634
the trick is not to panic and
wait for a clerk to go on break.

368
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,303
We don't need her help.

369
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:32,267
This is what you
call work-share.

370
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:33,976
What's that?

371
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:38,189
It means what it sounds like,

372
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,482
we all share the work.

373
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,693
She's in the way.

374
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,279
Don't say that,
she's your sister.

375
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:46,948
She's not my sister.

376
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,826
She's your sister.
Yuri is your sister!

377
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,500
You're his sister, right?

378
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,756
It's no big deal.

379
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,221
He doesn't mean it.

380
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,847
He's just rebelling now.

381
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,689
How much can you get for those?

382
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,983
About 40,000 to 50,000 yen.

383
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:29,490
With these, I won't have
to work anymore this month.

384
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,992
Hey Aki,

385
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:35,622
you should contribute, too.
You're making money, right?

386
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:39,834
She doesn't have to.
That's the deal we made, right?

387
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,838
She gets her big ideas
because you always spoil her.

388
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,383
You're the one
with the big ideas.

389
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:48,218
You're preying on her pension.

390
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,387
"Preying" is not a nice word.

391
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,972
Try preying on me if you can.

392
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,267
No one can prey on her.

393
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,144
Oh, I got myself
an insurance plan.

394
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:04,358
Because I don't want
a lonely death.

395
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,697
What do you call
that kind of insurance?

396
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:16,413
- You're so warm, Grandma.
- Watch out.

397
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,999
I'm mending with a needle,
watch out.

398
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,541
Whose clothes?

399
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,626
That girl, the little girl's.

400
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,259
Did something bad happen?

401
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:32,345
Why?

402
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:35,015
Your feet are colder than usual.

403
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:38,810
You know everything,
don't you, Grandma?

404
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:42,564
You're lucky to have
such a pretty nose.

405
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,442
You think so?
I don't like it very much.

406
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,028
Don't stare at me.

407
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,783
Yuri! Lick salt
before you go to bed!

408
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:55,535
She's right there.

409
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,578
What? Why?

410
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,208
What's going on? You must be
cold, sitting out here.

411
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,462
Will he come home?

412
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:11,134
You're worried about Shota?

413
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,311
It's not your fault, Yuri.

414
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:35,367
How about the name "No lonely
death" for the insurance plan?

415
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,750
Even though she's being
abused by her parents...

416
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,588
You mean Yuri?

417
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,551
She should be more worried about
her own troubles.

418
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:57,681
With a mother who wishes
she hadn't given birth to you,

419
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,934
usually,
you'd turn out more like us.

420
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:07,816
You're right.

421
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,070
You don't grow up
to care about others.

422
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,116
You're right.

423
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:32,798
Here you are.

424
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:39,972
I figured.

425
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,434
Ouch.

426
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,103
It's so cold.

427
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,106
Yuri's so worried,

428
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,942
she's been waiting for you
by the door the whole time.

429
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,405
You don't like Yuri?

430
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,534
So, what's wrong?

431
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:03,621
It's more fun with just us guys.

432
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,706
Of course, it is.

433
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,292
But for Yuri,

434
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,211
if she helps us out,

435
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:13,006
it's easier to live with us.

436
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:15,925
Right?

437
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:19,721
Got it?

438
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:21,389
Got it.

439
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:25,684
Yuri is your what?

440
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:29,314
My sister.

441
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:31,691
That's right, right, right.

442
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,985
In that case, what am I?

443
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,694
I'm your...

444
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,157
Da...

445
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,160
- It's OK.
- Say it, c'mon.

446
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,370
Just try saying it, once.
Go ahead.

447
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,331
I will, someday.

448
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,458
Shoot, not fair.

449
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,626
Oh well.

450
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:53,505
OK. Someday, then.

451
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:00,010
Let's go home, it's cold.

452
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:16,068
Hey, did you
sell the fishing rods?

453
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,904
They are still there.

454
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:20,699
OK, then.

455
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,742
What, you want to fish?

456
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:31,166
Do you know what Swimmy is?

457
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,507
Your dad can't speak English.

458
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:43,387
It's not English.
It's in the Japanese textbook.

459
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:49,227
Your dad's Japanese
is even worse.

460
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:54,148
Swimmy is a story about
a bunch of little fish,

461
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,193
that beat up a great big tuna.

462
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,155
Do you know why?

463
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,489
Why?

464
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,452
Must be because
tuna tastes good, right?

465
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:07,913
I don't think so.

466
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,290
We haven't eaten
any tuna recently.

467
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,651
I'm going to eat you all up!

468
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,422
- Hey, hey.
- What?

469
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:02,800
Did you know
there used to be a pond here?

470
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:04,678
Yeah.

471
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,888
Apparently, Grandpa used to
keep carp in it.

472
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,476
You couldn't keep carp
in a place like this.

473
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:14,061
I'm sure that's one of
Grandma's tall tales.

474
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:19,568
The last time Juri was seen
was February 8th.

475
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:25,657
A neighbor remembers seeing her
playing alone outside her home.

476
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:29,661
She has been missing for over
two months, but her parents

477
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,871
never filed a missing persons
report with the police.

478
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,416
Was it really Yuri?

479
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:43,215
What are you smelling me for.

480
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,384
Hey, don't.

481
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,846
Hey, Yuri's on TV.

482
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:57,856
She was reported missing when

483
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,525
Child Welfare Service
contacted the police.

484
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:05,279
Why did her parents
tell lie after lie?

485
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:07,615
Why did they
hide her disappearance

486
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:08,950
for over two months?

487
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,411
The police are
questioning them

488
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:12,871
as important
material witnesses.

489
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:16,541
The cops think her parents
killed her.

490
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,005
What? So, her name is Juri,
not Yuri.

491
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,052
This looks bad. Really bad.

492
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,346
It's too late for that now.

493
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,726
Hey, Yuri, listen.

494
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,772
Can you find your way home
by yourself?

495
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,902
She can't do that,
it's too late.

496
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:45,362
What will you do?

497
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:48,073
Try going home?

498
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,076
You'll stay here, right?

499
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,504
How about Hana? I had
wanted to name a girl that.

500
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,213
Hana?

501
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,465
She doesn't look like a Hana.

502
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:10,512
Let's see.

503
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:12,931
Lin?

504
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,099
- Do you write it like a bell?
- No.

505
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,810
You know, that other way.

506
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,570
It's short.

507
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,405
All done!

508
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,447
You look cute!

509
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,617
- It's a good disguise.
- You look so cute.

510
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,245
Want to see a mirror?

511
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:37,289
Looking good.

512
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:39,040
A real beauty.

513
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:40,750
Looks good.

514
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,130
Short, isn't it?

515
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:48,465
What do you think?

516
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:52,762
- It's cute.
- It's cute.

517
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:54,639
You're cute.

518
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,267
Your hair's naturally brown.

519
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,270
I'm jealous of your hair.

520
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,817
Say...

521
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:13,365
I have another name, too.

522
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:16,118
What is it?

523
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:18,997
Sayaka.

524
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:26,253
I like Lin better.

525
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:32,760
I like Lin better, too.

526
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:36,096
I'm Lin.

527
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:39,601
Hello, I'm Lin.

528
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,019
Like this.

529
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,664
The man saved you, right?

530
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,211
Do you like Auntie and Grandma?

531
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:12,634
So, you can stand it?

532
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,136
I can.

533
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:21,643
I was sure
she'd want to go home.

534
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:26,606
Do you think she... chose us?

535
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,608
Usually, you can't choose
your own parents.

536
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:33,989
But then, maybe it's stronger
when you choose them yourself.

537
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,072
What is?

538
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:36,575
What is...

539
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:39,493
The bond.

540
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:41,745
The bond.

541
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:46,710
I chose you, too.

542
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,429
- Amazing.
- Right?

543
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,434
- Do that again.
- Again?

544
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:33,964
Shota!

545
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:39,054
You're so cool, Dad!

546
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:40,972
Are you a kid?

547
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,599
Shut up.

548
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:46,852
Tell me.

549
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:49,940
What?

550
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:53,067
When do you and Nobuyo...

551
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:56,153
do it?

552
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:03,577
We don't need that anymore.

553
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:07,415
Is that true?

554
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:12,086
We're...

555
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:16,632
connected in our hearts,
not down here.

556
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,551
Cut it out.

557
00:45:19,594 --> 00:45:20,637
Sounds fishy.

558
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:25,224
How do you think
we're connected?

559
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:33,525
Money.

560
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:35,819
Normally.

561
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,865
But we're not normal.

562
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:49,541
You're so cool, Dad!

563
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:54,253
Just a normal one is fine.

564
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:00,634
Say, Lin, have you ever been
to a beach?

565
00:46:03,262 --> 00:46:04,597
How about you?

566
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,641
What? Sure, I think so.

567
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,811
You think so.

568
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,442
Coming in.

569
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:18,737
She looks so cute.

570
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:20,363
What's this?

571
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:22,949
Your bag won't fit all that.

572
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:26,952
Then just wear it out.

573
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:29,747
Just wear it out.

574
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,210
Which looks better?

575
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,586
She looks so good in yellow.

576
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:38,255
Her hair is brown.

577
00:46:39,673 --> 00:46:41,050
We'll get this one, then.

578
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,427
Great, great.

579
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:45,554
You don't want it?

580
00:46:47,014 --> 00:46:48,016
Why not?

581
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:49,809
Won't hit me?

582
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,187
You won't hit me later?

583
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:02,739
I'm not going to hit you.

584
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:09,578
Three, four, knock at the door

585
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:15,417
Five, six, pick up sticks

586
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:17,295
Time to get out?

587
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,273
What's that?

588
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,651
An octopus.

589
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:44,072
I'm going to catch fish.

590
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:45,990
Catch a fish?

591
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:48,535
It looks so real.

592
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,666
What happened to you there?

593
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,798
This?
I got burned with a hot iron.

594
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,261
Me, too.

595
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:12,350
We're the same.

596
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:23,819
It's OK. It's all better.

597
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,744
OK, OK. Thank you.

598
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:40,377
"He taught them
to swim close together,

599
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:42,797
each in his own place,

600
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,802
and when they had learned to
swim like one giant fish,

601
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:50,722
he said, 'I'll be the eye.'

602
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:53,642
And so they swam
in the cool morning water,

603
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:58,020
and joining together
in the midday sun,

604
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,067
they chased the big fish away".

605
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:05,486
Yay! Great job.

606
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:08,907
But don't you feel sorry
for the big fish?

607
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:12,117
That's not true, after all,
he ate all your friends, right?

608
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:13,745
That's true, but...

609
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:35,891
Come, sit here.

610
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,032
Let's burn it.

611
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:54,952
OK?

612
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:15,514
The reason they hit you...

613
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:19,728
isn't because you are bad.

614
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:26,483
If they say they hit you
because they love you,

615
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:28,612
that is a lie.

616
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:32,115
If they loved you,

617
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:35,410
if they really loved you,

618
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:38,997
this is what you do.

619
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:49,673
This is what you do.

620
00:51:27,878 --> 00:51:29,713
There's really a bug.

621
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:33,677
Look, a boat.

622
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:37,138
Hey!

623
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,490
Brother!

624
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:56,992
Yes.

625
00:51:58,702 --> 00:51:59,703
What is it?

626
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,251
A cicada.

627
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:07,626
Where?

628
00:52:07,835 --> 00:52:10,129
It hasn't grown up
and come out of its shell yet.

629
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:15,969
A caterpillar, don't get itchy.

630
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:17,177
It touched.

631
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:26,771
Go for it, go for it, go for it!

632
00:53:02,056 --> 00:53:03,098
Hey!

633
00:53:16,112 --> 00:53:17,239
I'll give you these.

634
00:53:23,494 --> 00:53:25,204
Don't make your sister do it.

635
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,311
Are you firing one of us?

636
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:52,356
Why is it between us?

637
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:56,860
Well, we're in a real bind too.

638
00:53:58,195 --> 00:54:00,239
If we have to cut back,

639
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:04,618
it has to be one of you
with the higher hourly wages.

640
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:11,500
Can the two of you
please talk it over?

641
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:24,764
Why does it have to be me?

642
00:54:25,389 --> 00:54:26,932
I said, I'm asking you.

643
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:30,644
But that's not...
We're both hard up,

644
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:32,980
it's not just you, you know.

645
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,108
If you let me stay,

646
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:38,153
I'll keep quiet.

647
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:41,655
You were stealing stuff, too.

648
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:43,617
Not about that.

649
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:46,828
The news...

650
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:50,248
I saw you...

651
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,793
when you were
with that little girl.

652
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:10,184
OK.

653
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:15,898
But if you talk,
I will kill you.

654
00:55:35,793 --> 00:55:39,922
How is father's former wife
related to you now?

655
00:55:41,048 --> 00:55:43,802
I know, but I can't help it.

656
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,594
But she keeps visiting.

657
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:47,681
Don't mind me.

658
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:51,893
I just stopped by
to honor his memory.

659
00:55:52,226 --> 00:55:53,478
- Yes.
- Yes.

660
00:56:01,443 --> 00:56:03,112
Is everyone doing well?

661
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:06,699
I haven't seen them
since my father's funeral.

662
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:12,079
You can't fight blood.

663
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:14,373
This area is...

664
00:56:25,467 --> 00:56:26,427
Welcome.

665
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:27,511
I'm off.

666
00:56:27,637 --> 00:56:29,222
Sayaka, dinner tonight?

667
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:31,099
- What?
- Cabbage rolls tonight.

668
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:33,643
Yay, I'm in. But with tomato,
not white sauce.

669
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:35,102
Off you go.

670
00:56:35,603 --> 00:56:37,897
- Save me my slice of cake.
- The Mont Blanc.

671
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:39,774
- I'm off.
- Off you go.

672
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:42,611
She's so grown up.

673
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,819
Yes.

674
00:56:44,695 --> 00:56:46,572
She's a sophomore.

675
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,702
And your older daughter?

676
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,166
You mean, Aki?

677
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,918
Yes.

678
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:59,501
She's abroad, right?

679
00:57:00,878 --> 00:57:04,715
Yes, she seems to be
enjoying Australia.

680
00:57:06,217 --> 00:57:07,176
Right?

681
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:10,347
She didn't come home
for summer vacation,

682
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:12,473
which made her father sad.

683
00:57:13,057 --> 00:57:16,769
Oh, I see, that's wonderful.

684
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:23,067
Here.

685
00:57:24,402 --> 00:57:25,653
It's not very much, but...

686
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:28,614
Oh, I see.

687
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:30,784
Well, in that case, thanks.

688
00:57:30,992 --> 00:57:34,663
I'm very sorry about what
happened with my mother.

689
00:57:35,204 --> 00:57:39,708
Well, it's hardly your fault.

690
00:57:54,682 --> 00:57:56,476
Shoot, only 30,000 yen again.

691
00:58:06,735 --> 00:58:08,279
Thank you so much.

692
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:12,617
I hope you enjoyed it.

693
00:58:16,454 --> 00:58:17,539
Mr. Four,

694
00:58:19,373 --> 00:58:21,834
let's go to the chat room.

695
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:26,297
I'd like to see your face, too,

696
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,633
Mr. Four.

697
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:40,019
Great.

698
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:44,190
What shall we do?

699
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:46,693
Cuddle?

700
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:49,862
Hug? Sleep on my lap?

701
00:58:54,742 --> 00:58:56,244
My little sister...

702
00:58:57,202 --> 00:59:01,081
Her mother bought her
a bathing suit,

703
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:03,793
and she just loves it.

704
00:59:04,126 --> 00:59:08,172
She wears it around the house,
even when she takes a bath.

705
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:12,885
And it just reminds me
how I used to do that.

706
00:59:13,677 --> 00:59:16,096
I used to do
the exact same thing.

707
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:22,770
It's OK to talk to me,
in this room.

708
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:26,274
I mean...

709
00:59:35,074 --> 00:59:36,408
What happened here?

710
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:45,793
You hit someone?

711
00:59:48,713 --> 00:59:49,714
Who?

712
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:55,804
I've...

713
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:00,976
hit myself, too.

714
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:06,815
It hurts, doesn't it?

715
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,568
It hurts, right?

716
01:00:20,036 --> 01:00:21,329
It's all right.

717
01:00:46,771 --> 01:00:48,148
It's warm together.

718
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:04,706
Does it hurt?

719
01:01:05,414 --> 01:01:06,541
Yeah.

720
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,546
I can feel it's going to rain.

721
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,382
Your leg comes in handy.

722
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,434
Cold noodles
hit the spot in summer.

723
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:26,894
Yup.

724
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,336
Why'd you put makeup on?

725
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:58,425
The department store clerk
recommended it.

726
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:04,682
This, too.

727
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:11,273
Hey, how did you afford it?

728
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,275
I just got fired.

729
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:16,444
They found you out?

730
01:02:16,777 --> 01:02:19,697
Something like that.

731
01:02:23,492 --> 01:02:27,038
We could open
another bar, together.

732
01:02:27,371 --> 01:02:28,831
Way downtown.

733
01:02:29,748 --> 01:02:32,167
If we hire Aki,
we might do well.

734
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:35,170
No, you're still
looking good, you.

735
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:39,009
If you wear makeup,
like in the old days.

736
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:44,471
Here comes the rain, see?

737
01:02:55,858 --> 01:02:59,737
I'm just so tired.

738
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,335
You got this too?

739
01:03:15,586 --> 01:03:16,838
You can tell?

740
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:21,967
1,980 yen.
Looks more expensive, right?

741
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:24,971
It looks great.

742
01:04:08,306 --> 01:04:11,226
Hey, hey what, what...

743
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:13,269
Oh, oh.

744
01:04:21,443 --> 01:04:22,445
Oh, oh.

745
01:04:30,244 --> 01:04:33,581
I can't run any more.

746
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:40,755
Does this mean
thunder is coming?

747
01:04:43,173 --> 01:04:44,134
Hurry!

748
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,594
There'll be thunder, right?

749
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:08,074
What are you acting cool for?

750
01:05:10,534 --> 01:05:11,786
I did it.

751
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:16,290
Hey, I did it, right?

752
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,293
Yeah, well.

753
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:24,965
What's with you, looking like
you're not totally satisfied.

754
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,885
I hardly broke a sweat.

755
01:05:28,177 --> 01:05:29,721
You're a liar, you.

756
01:05:29,887 --> 01:05:30,971
Gimme.

757
01:05:45,402 --> 01:05:46,362
Another round?

758
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:49,782
No, hey,
how old do you think I am?

759
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:53,327
Let me bask in the afterglow
a little longer.

760
01:05:53,869 --> 01:05:57,039
Your afterglow is a lot longer.
You're soaked in sweat.

761
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:03,296
I did it, right?

762
01:06:11,387 --> 01:06:15,683
Hey, look, you've got leeks
on your back.

763
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:16,893
What?

764
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:19,186
Where?

765
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:23,190
Where? What?

766
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:29,280
Don't, stop, that tickles.

767
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:38,081
Tastes salty, the leek.

768
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:47,215
Oh, they're back.
They're home, home!

769
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:50,510
We're home!

770
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,889
Oh, you got caught in the rain!

771
01:06:54,806 --> 01:06:56,557
We found a cicada grub.

772
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:58,393
What, a cicada, OK.

773
01:06:58,643 --> 01:07:00,519
I'm soaked.

774
01:07:00,728 --> 01:07:02,230
It just started pouring.

775
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,400
That's right, pouring rain.
All right, OK.

776
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:07,235
Pouring rain!

777
01:07:07,485 --> 01:07:09,195
What were you doing?

778
01:07:09,445 --> 01:07:11,572
Look, it's raining, raining.

779
01:07:11,947 --> 01:07:13,115
It poured.

780
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:16,911
Take your cicada and
go take a bath, a bath, go!

781
01:07:18,454 --> 01:07:21,958
Make a hole in the center,
and let's...

782
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:25,211
put it in there, young lady.

783
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:29,215
Here goes, yes, watch carefully.

784
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:33,260
How many kids?

785
01:07:33,802 --> 01:07:34,929
- Three.
- Three?

786
01:07:35,137 --> 01:07:38,724
The daughter-in-law
sweet talked her son,

787
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:41,101
and they moved out.

788
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:45,231
Oh, yeah. That happens a lot.

789
01:07:45,481 --> 01:07:46,775
I'm home.

790
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,568
Welcome home.

791
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,239
- Did you get rained on?
- I was fine.

792
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:57,452
- What?
- Did something good happen?

793
01:07:59,286 --> 01:08:01,538
I'll tell you soon, Grandma.

794
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:03,041
I see.

795
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,543
I see, she says.

796
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:06,085
Was it a guy?

797
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:07,878
That's right!

798
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,131
What kind of guy?

799
01:08:10,297 --> 01:08:13,050
Just a regular customer
where I work.

800
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,262
- What?
- He was a customer.

801
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:19,807
So, we're the same.

802
01:08:20,182 --> 01:08:21,810
Even if that's the same...

803
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:24,229
But it's important.

804
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:25,814
What?

805
01:08:26,021 --> 01:08:27,064
Is he handsome?

806
01:08:28,315 --> 01:08:29,733
Yeah, you could say so.

807
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,027
That's different.

808
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:32,612
It's different.

809
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:34,447
So, what's he like?

810
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:36,658
The quiet type.

811
01:08:36,865 --> 01:08:40,119
The quiet type is good,
the quiet types are...

812
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:44,457
Talkative men are no good,
talkative men are bad!

813
01:08:44,582 --> 01:08:45,916
You calling me?

814
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,003
- Not calling you!
- Not calling you!

815
01:08:49,378 --> 01:08:51,088
Here goes, here goes!

816
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:52,632
Here goes, blow!

817
01:08:53,925 --> 01:08:54,926
It disappeared again!

818
01:08:55,051 --> 01:08:57,846
Look! Look.

819
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:00,765
- Where'd it go?
- Look, where'd it go?

820
01:09:01,224 --> 01:09:02,434
- Amazing, right?
- It's really gone.

821
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:03,935
Where was it before?

822
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:05,520
- Where was it before?
- Here.

823
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:09,482
Maybe it's here again?
Maybe it's here again, or here?

824
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:10,859
No, no, it's not there.

825
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:13,528
Where, where, what?
Where, where.

826
01:09:13,653 --> 01:09:15,238
Look, it's gone!

827
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,323
What's that?

828
01:09:17,448 --> 01:09:19,701
What are you doing!

829
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:23,872
Idiot! Cut it out, cut it out.

830
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:25,582
- That's all?
- No, no, no.

831
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:27,584
- That's all.
- No!

832
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:28,835
Ouch!

833
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:31,046
I had thought it was amazing.

834
01:09:31,253 --> 01:09:32,213
Don't do that.

835
01:09:32,463 --> 01:09:33,547
All right, hey!

836
01:09:33,797 --> 01:09:35,050
I can do some of it, too.

837
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:37,551
I'll show you a more amazing
trick. You'll be shocked!

838
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:40,054
- Bring the deck of cards.
- I know that trick.

839
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:42,932
Don't tell them, you dummy!

840
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:45,476
Don't get up!
Do that over there.

841
01:09:47,645 --> 01:09:48,729
Find it?

842
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,398
- No.
- Below the red one.

843
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,609
Hey.

844
01:09:55,487 --> 01:09:57,404
He said,
"Don't make your sister do it".

845
01:09:57,655 --> 01:09:58,739
Do what?

846
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:00,617
This.

847
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:03,536
Who did?

848
01:10:04,203 --> 01:10:05,663
The Yamatoya guy.

849
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:08,875
Of course, it's still too early
for Lin to...

850
01:10:10,292 --> 01:10:11,252
Find it?

851
01:10:11,836 --> 01:10:12,837
I can't.

852
01:10:14,005 --> 01:10:17,300
What are you doing?
It shouldn't be hard to find.

853
01:10:40,823 --> 01:10:43,826
You old fart,
you'll catch a cold.

854
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:48,539
Oh, fireworks.

855
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:51,084
On the Sumida River.

856
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:54,461
In the old days,
we went every year.

857
01:10:54,962 --> 01:10:57,965
After I got rained on one year,
I stopped going.

858
01:10:58,091 --> 01:10:59,843
Rain cancels fireworks.

859
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,344
Can't see them, right?

860
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,137
Sounds only.

861
01:11:03,345 --> 01:11:04,305
Can't see them.

862
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:05,806
It's almost over.

863
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,100
The show's over.

864
01:11:08,976 --> 01:11:10,144
All over?

865
01:11:13,856 --> 01:11:16,984
That huge one.
What's it called? The Peony?

866
01:11:19,904 --> 01:11:22,114
The one that tumbles down
is the Willow.

867
01:11:28,121 --> 01:11:29,914
See, look.

868
01:11:30,164 --> 01:11:32,751
- I can't see a thing.
- Can't see, but listen to it.

869
01:12:04,365 --> 01:12:05,324
What else?

870
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:07,786
A cloud that looks like a fish.

871
01:12:07,993 --> 01:12:09,078
You're right.

872
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:11,623
Does it look like a whale?

873
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:13,792
- A fish.
- Is it?

874
01:12:36,564 --> 01:12:39,525
Shota, hurry up and blow it up!

875
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:47,367
A huge wave!

876
01:12:54,373 --> 01:12:55,708
Amazing.

877
01:12:57,252 --> 01:13:00,839
Shota, you like boobs?

878
01:13:01,088 --> 01:13:02,047
Not especially.

879
01:13:02,298 --> 01:13:04,091
Liar, I saw you looking.

880
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:06,552
Why?

881
01:13:06,802 --> 01:13:09,555
It's all right.
All men like boobs.

882
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:12,559
Your Daddy loves them, too.

883
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:17,021
Tell me.

884
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:21,692
Are you getting big down there
in the mornings?

885
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:23,444
Why?

886
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:25,572
Right?

887
01:13:26,197 --> 01:13:27,239
Everybody does?

888
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:30,117
Everybody does. All men do.

889
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:32,579
Feel better?

890
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:34,872
I thought maybe I was sick.

891
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:36,123
You're healthy!

892
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,001
Great!

893
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:47,761
Feels good?

894
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:57,354
It's cold!

895
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:03,443
Say...

896
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:05,904
it's just like I said, right?

897
01:14:06,154 --> 01:14:08,573
It's not going to last long.

898
01:14:09,365 --> 01:14:10,908
I know that.

899
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:17,539
But sometimes, it's better
to choose your own family.

900
01:14:17,957 --> 01:14:22,002
If only not to
have expectations.

901
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:23,755
Yeah, it is.

902
01:14:27,884 --> 01:14:32,471
Lady, when I look closely,
you're a good-looking woman.

903
01:14:36,393 --> 01:14:37,476
What did you say?

904
01:14:38,185 --> 01:14:39,311
Your face.

905
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:47,279
I'm off.

906
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:06,172
Oh, look at all the age spots.

907
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:27,860
Thank you.

908
01:15:34,408 --> 01:15:36,493
Watch out, Shota!

909
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:41,875
Watch out!

910
01:15:42,082 --> 01:15:43,792
Hey, those...

911
01:15:46,128 --> 01:15:48,797
That's not a swimsuit,
they're underpants.

912
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:34,010
What is it?

913
01:16:35,302 --> 01:16:36,805
Don't open it suddenly.

914
01:16:38,014 --> 01:16:39,599
My tooth came out.

915
01:16:39,849 --> 01:16:40,891
Your tooth?

916
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:02,080
You say, "Please grow a strong
tooth" and then you throw it.

917
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:06,459
Say, "Grow back in,"
and throw it.

918
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:10,171
Grandma.

919
01:17:13,382 --> 01:17:14,634
Wake up.

920
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,220
Wake up.

921
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:20,806
Wake up.

922
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:24,978
C'mon, wake up.

923
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:30,442
Hey, Grandma.

924
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:32,319
Grandma!

925
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:34,487
Oh, no, Aki!

926
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:36,489
Get me the phone!

927
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:40,118
Move.

928
01:17:43,579 --> 01:17:45,789
- What the hell!
- She's dead.

929
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:49,002
Look at her, she's not
coming back to life.

930
01:17:52,087 --> 01:17:53,840
We can't call an ambulance here.

931
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:02,806
There's nothing we can do.

932
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:05,644
We each get our turn.

933
01:18:11,774 --> 01:18:14,693
What about a funeral?
Or cremation?

934
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:16,820
We don't have money for that.

935
01:18:17,197 --> 01:18:18,323
But, you...

936
01:18:21,408 --> 01:18:23,327
Let's just stay by her side
a little longer.

937
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:27,623
She gets lonely too, right?

938
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:37,217
What? No, you...

939
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:39,678
Lin, you...

940
01:18:40,427 --> 01:18:43,430
You don't want to say goodbye
to Grandma, do you?

941
01:18:43,681 --> 01:18:44,640
No.

942
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:33,106
Listen, this is a big secret.

943
01:19:34,815 --> 01:19:36,818
Grandma was never here.

944
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:39,237
It's been always
five in our family.

945
01:19:40,654 --> 01:19:41,614
Got it?

946
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:44,033
Yeah.

947
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:13,646
I can't believe
we're burying another one.

948
01:20:15,148 --> 01:20:18,318
But this is really different
from that time.

949
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:21,487
You're right.

950
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:26,618
Depending on
how you think about,

951
01:20:28,703 --> 01:20:29,955
Grandma must be happy.

952
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,249
Of course she is.

953
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:34,918
So much better than dying alone.

954
01:20:42,716 --> 01:20:44,009
There's more.

955
01:20:57,274 --> 01:20:59,067
You know, when I die...

956
01:20:59,442 --> 01:21:01,403
What?

957
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:08,702
Bury me under the pond
in the yard.

958
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:17,168
That pond isn't big enough.

959
01:21:18,752 --> 01:21:19,962
You're right.

960
01:21:29,389 --> 01:21:32,225
Wait, you always walk out wet.
Wipe your feet.

961
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:33,643
I know that.

962
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:03,881
How much?

963
01:22:04,506 --> 01:22:06,425
116,000 yen.

964
01:22:07,927 --> 01:22:09,136
Whose money?

965
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,263
It's Grandma's money.

966
01:22:12,932 --> 01:22:14,184
So, it's not bad.

967
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,935
It's not bad.

968
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:20,564
What about shoplifting?

969
01:22:22,692 --> 01:22:24,319
What does your father say?

970
01:22:25,612 --> 01:22:29,449
Whatever's in a store
doesn't belong to anyone yet.

971
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:41,211
Well, as long as the store
doesn't go bankrupt, it's OK.

972
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:54,849
Hello, young mother, croquettes
for your son?

973
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:00,230
Do you like being called mother?

974
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:02,440
By whom?

975
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:04,733
By Lin.

976
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:07,529
I won't know until she does.

977
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,617
Why do you ask me that?

978
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:17,122
Because he wants me
to call him "Dad."

979
01:23:19,164 --> 01:23:20,332
But you can't.

980
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:22,710
No, not yet.

981
01:23:27,923 --> 01:23:31,552
It's really not a big deal.
So, don't worry about it.

982
01:23:33,095 --> 01:23:34,138
OK.

983
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,318
What was that?

984
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:49,779
You try it.

985
01:23:58,496 --> 01:24:00,414
Grandma's amazing,

986
01:24:00,623 --> 01:24:03,042
she keeps helping us out
even after she's dead.

987
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:06,713
Well, the really helpful one
is the old man.

988
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:13,261
What can you see?

989
01:24:14,136 --> 01:24:15,471
What? The ocean.

990
01:24:18,682 --> 01:24:19,893
The universe.

991
01:24:20,685 --> 01:24:21,811
Universe?

992
01:24:22,645 --> 01:24:25,023
Found it! Found it!
I knew she'd stashed some away!

993
01:24:25,231 --> 01:24:26,858
With her dentures.

994
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:28,360
For real?

995
01:24:28,984 --> 01:24:31,320
There it is, amazing!

996
01:24:35,533 --> 01:24:38,495
It's in there? It is.

997
01:24:38,703 --> 01:24:41,164
- Wow, amazing!
- 10, 11, 12.

998
01:24:41,372 --> 01:24:44,500
13, 14, 15!

999
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:49,172
Amazing! That's 30,000 yen each.

1000
01:24:49,838 --> 01:24:51,841
Did Grandma have a scam going?

1001
01:24:52,384 --> 01:24:53,551
Money is money.

1002
01:25:09,024 --> 01:25:10,025
Hey.

1003
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:11,528
What?

1004
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:14,447
Don't these belong to someone?

1005
01:25:20,953 --> 01:25:22,079
So, what?

1006
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:26,585
What?

1007
01:25:31,881 --> 01:25:32,840
Hey.

1008
01:25:34,717 --> 01:25:37,804
You want to try this, too?

1009
01:25:38,637 --> 01:25:40,556
Hey, hey!

1010
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,603
In that case, hey...

1011
01:25:46,896 --> 01:25:49,440
You be the lookout
by the stairs, OK?

1012
01:26:11,212 --> 01:26:12,838
This is amazing.

1013
01:26:17,051 --> 01:26:18,302
Back when...

1014
01:26:20,012 --> 01:26:21,305
When you saved me...

1015
01:26:21,472 --> 01:26:22,515
What!

1016
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,186
Were you trying to steal
something from the car, too?

1017
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:28,730
No, you dummy.

1018
01:26:29,104 --> 01:26:32,817
That time, I was just trying
to save you.

1019
01:26:37,529 --> 01:26:39,198
Shoot! Hey! Come!

1020
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:03,847
"In mourning."
What does this mean?

1021
01:27:16,027 --> 01:27:17,194
Day off?

1022
01:27:18,738 --> 01:27:20,155
Did it go bankrupt?

1023
01:27:29,082 --> 01:27:30,542
Welcome!

1024
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:32,543
You wait here.

1025
01:27:42,595 --> 01:27:43,888
Welcome!

1026
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:28,475
Hey.

1027
01:28:36,899 --> 01:28:37,858
Hey!

1028
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,212
Hey, you!

1029
01:29:31,704 --> 01:29:32,663
Hey!

1030
01:29:59,064 --> 01:30:01,400
- Shibata Shota.
- Shibata Shota.

1031
01:30:01,902 --> 01:30:03,360
How do you write that?

1032
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:06,155
The standard Shibata,
like the ballplayer.

1033
01:30:06,363 --> 01:30:07,531
Like the ballplayer.

1034
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:10,409
For "Sho,"
the character with sheep

1035
01:30:10,743 --> 01:30:12,871
and for "ta,"
the character for thick.

1036
01:30:13,078 --> 01:30:15,206
- How old is he?
- Oh, wait.

1037
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:21,838
He broke his leg,
but he didn't hit his head.

1038
01:30:22,546 --> 01:30:24,924
Excuse me,
are you Shota's mother?

1039
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:26,467
Yes.

1040
01:30:26,592 --> 01:30:28,636
You'll need to come with us
to the police precinct.

1041
01:30:28,761 --> 01:30:30,846
Oh, I just came to get him.

1042
01:30:30,971 --> 01:30:33,182
I left my other child at home.

1043
01:30:33,307 --> 01:30:35,560
We have to get
his insurance card and things.

1044
01:30:35,769 --> 01:30:38,188
- We'll be right back.
- I'm sorry, our other child...

1045
01:30:38,354 --> 01:30:40,856
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1046
01:30:45,237 --> 01:30:46,529
Listen.

1047
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:48,405
- Give me that.
- No.

1048
01:30:48,907 --> 01:30:50,367
- Why not?
- No!

1049
01:30:51,993 --> 01:30:54,663
OK, that's OK.

1050
01:30:55,329 --> 01:30:58,123
Listen, if they ask your name,
you tell them it's Lin.

1051
01:30:58,416 --> 01:30:59,543
And if they ask you
about Grandma,

1052
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:00,710
tell them you don't know her.

1053
01:31:00,877 --> 01:31:02,462
What about Brother?

1054
01:31:02,712 --> 01:31:04,089
Shota? We'll go get him later.

1055
01:31:04,296 --> 01:31:07,716
That's right. They'll feed him
at the hospital.

1056
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:09,427
Let's put Lin's shoes on here.

1057
01:31:09,636 --> 01:31:10,887
Don't bother.

1058
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:42,752
Wow, what a pretty color.

1059
01:31:45,546 --> 01:31:47,464
So, it was a beautiful day.

1060
01:31:47,882 --> 01:31:49,509
Amazing.

1061
01:31:53,805 --> 01:31:54,847
Juri.

1062
01:31:56,515 --> 01:31:58,643
How many of you
went to the beach?

1063
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:02,606
Five people.

1064
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:04,189
- Five people.
- Five people.

1065
01:32:05,649 --> 01:32:07,192
What were you doing
at the beach?

1066
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:08,612
Jumping.

1067
01:32:08,819 --> 01:32:09,862
Jumping?

1068
01:32:13,574 --> 01:32:16,493
Was your grandma with you then?

1069
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:27,672
Where were you living?

1070
01:32:29,841 --> 01:32:31,092
In a car.

1071
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,470
In a car?

1072
01:32:34,511 --> 01:32:35,846
All alone?

1073
01:32:36,347 --> 01:32:37,306
Yes.

1074
01:32:41,185 --> 01:32:44,063
Are you covering up for someone?

1075
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:49,818
When we got to the house,

1076
01:32:50,819 --> 01:32:52,780
they were all

1077
01:32:53,698 --> 01:32:57,410
packing their things up
and trying to run away,

1078
01:32:58,036 --> 01:32:59,412
abandoning you.

1079
01:33:01,622 --> 01:33:04,500
A real family would
never treat you like that.

1080
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:19,181
The man's real name is
Enoki Shota,

1081
01:33:19,724 --> 01:33:21,601
the woman is Tanabe Yuko.

1082
01:33:26,064 --> 01:33:28,108
They had killed someone?

1083
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:32,237
Her previous husband.

1084
01:33:33,738 --> 01:33:35,657
Stabbed him, killed him
and buried him.

1085
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:38,326
Tangled up
in a crime of passion.

1086
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:43,414
That's how those two...

1087
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:45,917
are connected.

1088
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:52,257
That was self-defense, right?

1089
01:33:53,507 --> 01:33:56,051
If we hadn't killed him,
he would've killed us both.

1090
01:33:58,345 --> 01:34:00,431
Well, that's how
the judge ruled.

1091
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:05,979
And what does that
have to do with this situation?

1092
01:34:08,355 --> 01:34:10,817
No, it wasn't a kidnapping.

1093
01:34:11,609 --> 01:34:14,362
She looked like
she was starving,

1094
01:34:14,945 --> 01:34:17,407
so Nobuyo brought her home.

1095
01:34:18,033 --> 01:34:20,368
And the girl was happy
to come with her.

1096
01:34:22,119 --> 01:34:23,329
When was that?

1097
01:34:25,623 --> 01:34:26,875
Last February.

1098
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:30,837
That's what we call kidnapping.

1099
01:34:31,796 --> 01:34:33,882
That's what I told her too,

1100
01:34:35,132 --> 01:34:36,425
but she said...

1101
01:34:37,176 --> 01:34:40,221
we weren't demanding a ransom,

1102
01:34:40,805 --> 01:34:42,349
so we were protecting her.

1103
01:34:44,475 --> 01:34:47,436
Thank you for coming.

1104
01:34:48,063 --> 01:34:49,564
How is Juri doing?

1105
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:51,190
Yes.

1106
01:34:51,774 --> 01:34:55,778
I guess she was relieved.
She fell fast asleep.

1107
01:34:56,404 --> 01:34:59,991
Nozomi,
what did Juri eat yesterday?

1108
01:35:01,618 --> 01:35:03,078
Her favorite,
omelet with rice.

1109
01:35:03,286 --> 01:35:04,412
You cooked it
for your daughter?

1110
01:35:05,329 --> 01:35:07,122
Yes, I cooked it.

1111
01:35:18,426 --> 01:35:19,636
That's because...

1112
01:35:20,761 --> 01:35:24,056
Grandma asked me to
move in with her.

1113
01:35:28,019 --> 01:35:31,648
But that wasn't out of kindness.

1114
01:35:36,944 --> 01:35:39,154
She was getting money
from the family

1115
01:35:39,738 --> 01:35:41,699
that stole her husband.

1116
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:47,454
Money?

1117
01:35:48,038 --> 01:35:49,582
From my parents?

1118
01:35:50,958 --> 01:35:53,295
They paid her
every time she visited.

1119
01:35:56,213 --> 01:36:01,760
What? So, my parents knew
that I was living with her?

1120
01:36:03,137 --> 01:36:05,681
Your parents say
they didn't know, but...

1121
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:25,409
So, Grandma...

1122
01:36:28,371 --> 01:36:30,498
only wanted their money?

1123
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:34,920
Not me.

1124
01:36:41,426 --> 01:36:44,512
Where is your grandma now?

1125
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:55,732
We're outside the house where
Shibata Hatsue was discovered.

1126
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:58,359
Several weeks have passed since
she died,

1127
01:36:58,568 --> 01:37:00,654
and the police
are investigating,

1128
01:37:00,819 --> 01:37:03,113
including the possibility
of murder.

1129
01:37:03,948 --> 01:37:07,076
What the people who
pretended to be her family

1130
01:37:07,284 --> 01:37:11,581
were doing in this house
remains shrouded in mystery.

1131
01:37:15,126 --> 01:37:17,753
So, you say you did it
all by yourself?

1132
01:37:19,588 --> 01:37:20,548
Yes.

1133
01:37:24,051 --> 01:37:26,595
The digging and the burying.

1134
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:30,225
That's right.

1135
01:37:31,475 --> 01:37:32,893
I did it all myself.

1136
01:37:34,061 --> 01:37:36,689
Corpse disposal carries
a heavy sentence.

1137
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:39,359
Do you understand?

1138
01:37:41,653 --> 01:37:43,070
I didn't throw her away.

1139
01:37:45,614 --> 01:37:46,740
Yes, you did.

1140
01:37:46,949 --> 01:37:48,284
I didn't throw her away.

1141
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:53,206
I found her.

1142
01:37:57,668 --> 01:37:59,671
Someone threw her away
and I found her.

1143
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,887
It was someone else
who threw her away.

1144
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:13,602
Didn't you feel guilty

1145
01:38:14,728 --> 01:38:16,354
making children shoplift?

1146
01:38:22,444 --> 01:38:23,528
I...

1147
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:29,242
don't know anything else
to teach them.

1148
01:38:33,037 --> 01:38:34,455
But still...

1149
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:42,546
Why did you name the boy Shota?

1150
01:38:45,216 --> 01:38:46,884
That's your real name, right?

1151
01:39:10,242 --> 01:39:11,534
Is it an apartment?

1152
01:39:12,827 --> 01:39:14,371
A two-story house.

1153
01:39:18,082 --> 01:39:21,835
You'll live there
with six other children.

1154
01:39:23,921 --> 01:39:25,673
- Just with other kids?
- Yes.

1155
01:39:27,259 --> 01:39:31,346
You could commute to school
from there, Shota.

1156
01:39:35,766 --> 01:39:39,019
I thought only kids who can't
study at home go to school.

1157
01:39:44,775 --> 01:39:46,110
There are some things

1158
01:39:46,903 --> 01:39:48,655
you can't study at home.

1159
01:39:49,447 --> 01:39:50,489
Like what?

1160
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:56,537
Meeting people.

1161
01:39:57,913 --> 01:39:59,498
Making new friends.

1162
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:03,545
How is Lin doing?

1163
01:40:10,594 --> 01:40:12,345
She went back to her family.

1164
01:40:13,137 --> 01:40:14,471
Her real family?

1165
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:16,766
Yeah.

1166
01:40:22,730 --> 01:40:26,025
Shota, if you, too...

1167
01:40:27,652 --> 01:40:30,070
But I don't remember anything.

1168
01:41:08,109 --> 01:41:09,653
You know, this...

1169
01:41:09,778 --> 01:41:14,032
Listen, I'm busy. Go away.

1170
01:41:18,536 --> 01:41:19,788
That hurts.

1171
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:23,458
I told you not to touch me.

1172
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:25,960
Just go away.

1173
01:41:32,132 --> 01:41:33,467
Say you're sorry.

1174
01:41:37,889 --> 01:41:39,599
Say you're sorry.

1175
01:41:51,653 --> 01:41:52,695
Juri...

1176
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,491
I'll buy you new clothes,
so come over here.

1177
01:42:01,829 --> 01:42:03,414
Why not? Come here.

1178
01:42:10,171 --> 01:42:12,465
Lin said she wanted to go back?

1179
01:42:13,257 --> 01:42:15,217
Yes, Juri is her name.

1180
01:42:18,054 --> 01:42:21,307
No, she would never say that.

1181
01:42:24,603 --> 01:42:28,648
Children need their mothers.

1182
01:42:33,944 --> 01:42:36,697
That's just what
mothers imagine.

1183
01:42:43,454 --> 01:42:45,707
Giving birth automatically
makes you a mother?

1184
01:42:49,377 --> 01:42:51,546
You can't become a mother
unless you do.

1185
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,387
I understand it's tough
for you that can't give birth.

1186
01:43:01,472 --> 01:43:02,765
Were you jealous?

1187
01:43:03,807 --> 01:43:05,351
Is that why you kidnapped her?

1188
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,193
Maybe.

1189
01:43:16,820 --> 01:43:19,114
Maybe I hated her, my mother.

1190
01:43:22,452 --> 01:43:24,204
What did the two children

1191
01:43:25,497 --> 01:43:27,539
call you?

1192
01:43:34,965 --> 01:43:36,091
Mommy?

1193
01:43:37,759 --> 01:43:38,885
Mother?

1194
01:44:18,382 --> 01:44:19,842
I wonder...

1195
01:44:39,988 --> 01:44:41,364
I wonder...

1196
01:45:58,149 --> 01:46:00,777
There are two types of lures.

1197
01:46:00,985 --> 01:46:04,029
There are soft lures,
made of rubber.

1198
01:46:04,530 --> 01:46:07,826
They look like small fish
or worms,

1199
01:46:07,993 --> 01:46:10,912
to catch other fish, they say.

1200
01:46:12,831 --> 01:46:16,251
And the other type...

1201
01:46:16,835 --> 01:46:20,963
is the hard lure,
it's called the hard lure.

1202
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:24,341
They're made from
wood or plastic,

1203
01:46:25,426 --> 01:46:30,055
and they're used to catch
big fish and things like that.

1204
01:46:32,516 --> 01:46:34,269
Where did you learn all that?

1205
01:46:36,313 --> 01:46:37,480
It was in a book.

1206
01:46:37,771 --> 01:46:38,939
In a book.

1207
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,614
I'm sorry,
you're doing my time, too.

1208
01:46:46,907 --> 01:46:48,574
You've got a record.

1209
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:52,287
You wouldn't get away
with just five years.

1210
01:46:53,496 --> 01:46:54,706
But you...

1211
01:46:55,332 --> 01:46:57,417
I had such a good time,

1212
01:46:59,627 --> 01:47:01,837
this is nothing, really.

1213
01:47:04,298 --> 01:47:05,507
I'm sorry.

1214
01:47:07,135 --> 01:47:08,845
It's because I got caught.

1215
01:47:12,306 --> 01:47:15,268
Don't worry about it.
Things don't always work out.

1216
01:47:16,853 --> 01:47:17,811
Right?

1217
01:47:18,939 --> 01:47:20,606
How is the facility?

1218
01:47:21,315 --> 01:47:23,234
Are you going to school
every day?

1219
01:47:23,443 --> 01:47:26,320
Yes, I got 8th place
in my Japanese test.

1220
01:47:28,030 --> 01:47:30,033
You're smart, Shota, right?

1221
01:47:31,993 --> 01:47:33,787
Did you cut your hair?

1222
01:47:36,538 --> 01:47:38,582
You look good, let's see.

1223
01:47:38,832 --> 01:47:40,251
He looks good, right?

1224
01:47:40,502 --> 01:47:42,754
You look cute, cute.

1225
01:47:42,962 --> 01:47:45,005
Doesn't he look handsome?

1226
01:47:47,384 --> 01:47:48,592
You look sweet.

1227
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:54,431
Shota.

1228
01:47:55,684 --> 01:47:56,685
Listen...

1229
01:47:57,894 --> 01:47:59,436
We found you...

1230
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:02,189
at the pachinko parlor.

1231
01:48:03,024 --> 01:48:04,651
The pachinko parlor in Matsudo.

1232
01:48:05,734 --> 01:48:08,153
The car was a red Toyota Vitz.

1233
01:48:10,864 --> 01:48:13,158
The license plate was Narashino.

1234
01:48:15,036 --> 01:48:16,078
Hey.

1235
01:48:18,622 --> 01:48:20,000
If you really want to,

1236
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:22,752
you can find your
real mom and dad.

1237
01:48:26,715 --> 01:48:27,673
Hey, you.

1238
01:48:29,509 --> 01:48:32,511
Did you tell me to bring Shota
here so you could tell him that?

1239
01:48:32,929 --> 01:48:33,930
That's right.

1240
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,059
You know it, too.

1241
01:48:41,229 --> 01:48:44,106
We're not good enough for him.

1242
01:49:00,206 --> 01:49:01,416
I'm done.

1243
01:49:05,045 --> 01:49:06,087
Hey.

1244
01:49:10,675 --> 01:49:11,676
Bye.

1245
01:49:13,052 --> 01:49:14,011
Hey.

1246
01:49:27,484 --> 01:49:28,652
Wow, amazing!

1247
01:49:40,747 --> 01:49:44,292
So tasty, a super combo.

1248
01:49:44,501 --> 01:49:45,627
Right?

1249
01:49:47,796 --> 01:49:49,338
Who taught you this?

1250
01:49:54,511 --> 01:49:55,387
Me?

1251
01:50:01,893 --> 01:50:05,313
Do you live here all alone?

1252
01:50:07,856 --> 01:50:09,192
It's tiny

1253
01:50:10,277 --> 01:50:12,194
but the bath is brand new.

1254
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,530
Want a bath later?

1255
01:50:17,658 --> 01:50:18,909
I'm not sure.

1256
01:50:19,202 --> 01:50:21,121
You're more than welcome to.

1257
01:50:22,413 --> 01:50:23,747
The bath is super clean.

1258
01:50:25,332 --> 01:50:26,960
Maybe I'll spend the night here.

1259
01:50:29,753 --> 01:50:31,422
But won't they get mad at you?

1260
01:50:33,966 --> 01:50:35,676
No different if I go back now.

1261
01:50:38,721 --> 01:50:39,764
Right.

1262
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:57,073
Hey, Shota.

1263
01:50:58,324 --> 01:50:59,326
Shota!

1264
01:51:00,659 --> 01:51:01,827
Come out here.

1265
01:51:08,627 --> 01:51:10,045
The snow's piling up.

1266
01:51:15,257 --> 01:51:16,509
Hey, be careful.

1267
01:51:26,101 --> 01:51:27,645
Let's make a snowman!

1268
01:52:29,623 --> 01:52:32,001
Tomorrow, you go home, right?

1269
01:52:34,045 --> 01:52:35,005
Yup.

1270
01:52:36,338 --> 01:52:37,506
Right.

1271
01:52:42,887 --> 01:52:43,846
Say...

1272
01:52:46,307 --> 01:52:48,393
Did you try to run away
without me?

1273
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:03,198
Yeah.

1274
01:53:06,077 --> 01:53:07,369
It's true.

1275
01:53:10,748 --> 01:53:12,833
But we got caught, first.

1276
01:53:15,337 --> 01:53:16,463
I see.

1277
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:20,257
I'm sorry.

1278
01:53:29,266 --> 01:53:30,476
From now on...

1279
01:53:33,729 --> 01:53:35,564
I'm not your dad.

1280
01:53:47,953 --> 01:53:48,912
Yup.

1281
01:54:11,434 --> 01:54:13,103
You tell them you're sorry.

1282
01:54:16,398 --> 01:54:18,817
Tell them I made you
spend the night.

1283
01:54:20,318 --> 01:54:21,903
Right, I'll do that.

1284
01:54:26,574 --> 01:54:28,867
I'm sorry, I can't see you.

1285
01:54:28,993 --> 01:54:30,452
I got caught.

1286
01:54:32,413 --> 01:54:34,748
I got caught on purpose.

1287
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,882
I see.

1288
01:54:56,645 --> 01:54:57,646
Hey, Shota.

1289
01:55:15,539 --> 01:55:17,333
Shota! Shota!

1290
01:55:50,783 --> 01:55:52,117
Dad.

1291
01:55:58,875 --> 01:56:02,420
One... Two...

1292
01:56:02,671 --> 01:56:05,840
Buckle my shoe

1293
01:56:06,048 --> 01:56:09,761
Three, four, knock at the door

1294
01:56:11,762 --> 01:56:15,600
Five, six, pick up sticks

1295
01:56:16,475 --> 01:56:19,853
Seven, eight, lay them straight

1296
01:56:20,063 --> 01:56:24,275
Nine, ten, a big fat hen

1297
01:56:24,734 --> 01:56:26,695
One, two...

1298
01:57:11,703 --> 01:57:16,703
