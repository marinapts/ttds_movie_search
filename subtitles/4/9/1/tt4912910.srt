1
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:40,841
Do you, Ethan, take Julia to
be your lawful wedded wife?

2
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:46,900
I do. - To have, to hold,
to love, cherish, honor and protect?

3
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:48,360
I do.

4
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:55,695
Shield from terrors know
and unknown? To lie, to deceive.

5
00:00:56,095 --> 00:01:01,612
To lead a double life. To fail to
prevent her abduction. Erase her identity.

6
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:06,050
Force her into hiding. Take
away all she has known. - Stop.

7
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:09,106
In a selfish, futile,
fleeting attempt... - Stop!

8
00:01:09,107 --> 00:01:13,122
...to escape your own true self.
- Please, stop.

9
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:16,630
And Julia do you
choose to accept... - Don’t!

10
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,025
I do.

11
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:19,728
No!

12
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,610
You should have killed me.

13
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:33,162
<i>BELFAST</i>

14
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,315
Fate whispers to the warrior.

15
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,743
The storm is coming.

16
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,411
And the warrior whispers back?

17
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:02,375
I am the storm.

18
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:35,263
<i>IDENTITY CONFIRMED
HUNT, ETHAN</i>

19
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:40,846
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.
The anarchist Solomon Lane.

20
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:43,761
Since you captured him,
two years ago, his absence

21
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:46,957
from the world stage has had
unintended consequences.

22
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:51,708
His syndicate of rogue covert operatives
continues to wreak havoc around the globe.

23
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,229
The <i>CIA</i> special activities
division has relentlessly

24
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,646
hunted Lanes elite
network of hostiles.

25
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:59,324
But many remain unknown and at large.

26
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:04,453
The reminiscence of this extremist splinter
cell refer to them self as <i>The Apostles</i>.

27
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,744
They have sync it up to the
policy of terror for hire.

28
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:10,298
Making them an even
greater threat.

29
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:13,610
They are responsible for the
recent smallpox outbreak in Indian

30
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:16,717
controlled Kashmir. Along the
borders of Children and Pakistan.

31
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:19,537
Threatening one third of
the worlds population.

32
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:23,159
The Epidemic is being contained but
intelligence would indicate that

33
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,132
a new client has hired the Apostles
for a more ambitious operation.

34
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:30,158
They have been contacted by this man.
An unidentified extremist

35
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,942
known only by the
codename John Lark.

36
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:35,407
Author of this apocalyptic
manifesto calling for

37
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:37,371
the destruction of the
current world order.

38
00:03:37,372 --> 00:03:39,534
<i>THERE HAS NEVER BEEN PEACE
WITHOUT FIRST A GREAT SUFFERING.</i>

39
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:42,222
It is believed Lark is responsible for
the disappearance of Norwegian

40
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,977
nuclear weapons
specialist, Nils Debruuk.

41
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:47,503
Dr. Debruuk security
clearance was revoked after

42
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:50,143
he expressed fiercely
anti-religious views.

43
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:52,463
Meanwhile, the Apostles
have been in contact

44
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:54,886
with elements of the eastern
European underworld

45
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:56,988
who are in possession
of 3 plutonium cores

46
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,739
stolen from a missile
base in eastern Russia.

47
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,184
This would indicate that John
Lark and the Apostles are

48
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:06,546
working together to acquire
functioning nuclear weapons.

49
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,780
<i>NAST</i> estimates that a man with Debruuks
knowledge, using the materials in play,

50
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:14,665
could complete 3 nuclear weapons
in as little as 72 hours.

51
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:19,993
These devices would be man portable and
deployable anywhere on Earth overnight.

52
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,212
In the hands of John Lark and
the Apostles these weapons

53
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:26,796
represent an unprecedented threat
to the countless millions.

54
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:30,323
Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to prevent the

55
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:34,518
Apostles from acquiring the plutonium
using any means at your disposal.

56
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:38,254
If you, or any members of your
<i>IMF</i> team, are caught or killed,

57
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:41,584
the Secretary will disavow any
knowledge of your actions.

58
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:45,403
Good luck, Ethan. This message
will self-destruct in 5 seconds.

59
00:04:57,637 --> 00:05:00,591
<i>BERLIN</i>

60
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:02,234
He's late.

61
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:03,703
He's never late.

62
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:05,414
He'll be here.

63
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:06,749
I don’t like it.

64
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,399
There's something about this guy.
He just...

65
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,094
really gives me the creeps.
- It's OK. Relax.

66
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:13,803
I'm relaxed.

67
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:17,342
You don’t sound relaxed. Luther,
does he sound relaxed to you?

68
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:21,558
He sounds terrified. - I'm not terrified.
I just have a bad feeling. That's all.

69
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:24,430
I though you said you were relaxed?
- It's entirely possible

70
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,944
to be relaxed any extremely
uneasy at the same time.

71
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:29,572
No, it's not.
- You do it all the time. - No, I don’t.

72
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,659
Yes, you do. - No, he doesn't.
- I'm supposed

73
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,358
to believe you're
perfectly relaxed?

74
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:35,733
Right here and now? In a
dark alleyway? Waiting

75
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,378
to buy dark market plutonium
from a psychopath? - Benji,

76
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,946
I wont let anything
happen to you.

77
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,614
<i>See, Benji, you're
perfectly safe.</i>

78
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:44,778
That's easy for your to say.
You're in the van.

79
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,802
Well, you want to be in
the field, tough guy.

80
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,977
<i>And tonight</i>, Luther, I'd
like to be in the van!

81
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:50,483
He's here.

82
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:52,262
Oh, God.

83
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,587
<i>Have that money ready, Luther.</i>
- Done.

84
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:17,859
Ethan, do you copy?
Do you copy?!

85
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:33,259
Are we finally gonna do this, or not?

86
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:43,354
I've survived in this business
with a help of a voice in my head.

87
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:49,053
This voice is never wrong.
Whenever I meet you...

88
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,166
It tells me the same thing.

89
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:52,889
What's that?

90
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:54,957
Nothing.

91
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:03,415
I'm here to do business.
Tell the voice to flip the coin.

92
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:36,498
What's that?

93
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,752
This is a beryllium rod.
It's just causing a

94
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:41,447
reaction with the plutonium
inside the core.

95
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:51,739
That's that.

96
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,115
The money?

97
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,565
The money.

98
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,649
Bring the money.

99
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:16,693
Luther, bring the money.

100
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,874
We're gonna need
that money, Luther.

101
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,347
Kill them!

102
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:36,108
I've got it!

103
00:08:40,643 --> 00:08:42,504
Luther, do you copy?
Luther?!

104
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,082
Luther, come in.

105
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:48,073
<i>Luther is not here right now.
What can the Apostles do for you...</i>

106
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,880
<i>...Hunt?</i>
- What do you want?

107
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:53,970
<i>You're not escaping, Hunt.
Give us the plutonium.</i>

108
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,871
<i>And walk away.</i>
- Benji, get the car!

109
00:08:57,401 --> 00:09:00,821
I don’t think I can do that.
- Benji, get the car.

110
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,299
We'll make your a deal, Hunt.

111
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:26,726
Give us the plutonium and
we won't kill your friend.

112
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:32,595
Don't you do it, Ethan!
Not for me!

113
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,469
I'm gonna count to 3.

114
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:49,532
One...

115
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:54,250
Two...
- Luther, I'm sorry.

116
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:55,556
Three!

117
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:13,393
I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do.
- We're good.

118
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:19,746
You're OK?
- I should be dead.

119
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:21,634
We should all be dead!

120
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:24,350
Why aren't we?

121
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,976
Where's the plutonium?

122
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,384
It's gone.

123
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:49,059
<i>If you're just joining us, three
massive explosions have gone off</i>

124
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,305
<i>simultaneously in what appears
to be a coordinated attack.</i>

125
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:55,868
<i>This image is live in Rome.
Looking towards the Vatican.</i>

126
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:58,817
<i>It's as close
as our cameras can get.</i>

127
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,247
<i>It's believed that the Pope was in
residence at the time of the blast.</i>

128
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:07,633
<i>Also live, we're looking at the Jerusalem
from just outside of the city.</i>

129
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,779
<i>Also live, the holly city of Mecca.
From the USS Ronald Reagan</i>

130
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,613
<i>in the Red Sea, off
the coast of Saudi Arabia.</i>

131
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,224
<i>Radiation has been detected.
Indicating that nuclear</i>

132
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:22,583
<i>weapons were used in these
unspeakable attacks.</i> - Ethan?

133
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:25,086
<i>No word on casualties yet...</i>.
- It's time.

134
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,564
<i>but we can assume the
death toll is catastrophic.</i>

135
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:30,703
<i>Early reports suggest the
weapons used would require a</i>

136
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:34,348
<i>highly specialized knowledge
that very few people possess.</i>

137
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:39,409
<i>The question now is who would attack
all three of this holly sites and why.</i>

138
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:44,150
<i>The attacks occurred at precisely
same moment. Just over an hour ago.</i>

139
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:47,951
<i>At 4:00 AM ET. Within minutes
of the attack Congress ordered</i>

140
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:51,959
<i>an emergency recess and the
Capitol building was evacuated.</i>

141
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,109
The President authorized... The White
House has declared state of emergency.

142
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,575
<i>Placing the military
at highest alert.</i>

143
00:11:59,576 --> 00:12:01,636
Would you excuse us, please?

144
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:05,273
Dr. Debruuk...

145
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,406
We know who you are. We read the
Manifesto we found in your lab.

146
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,562
There has never been peace
without first a great suffering.

147
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:27,498
The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.

148
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,719
See, this will unite them.

149
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,593
When they read this manifesto
they'll understand.

150
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:36,121
Nobody's gonna read
that manifesto, ever!

151
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:38,031
I can promise you that.

152
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:41,153
What day is it? How long
have I been here?

153
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,477
What's the last thing you remember?

154
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,769
I was driving...

155
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,252
Someone hit me.
- That was two weeks ago.

156
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:55,100
Two weeks?
- Two weeks. - This is yours, isn't it?

157
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,831
It's how Lark
communicated with you.

158
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,102
Lark?
- John Lark. We know all about him.

159
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,989
You know nothing!
- It's information in this phone that

160
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,837
could lead us to him. And
you have the pass-code.

161
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:08,643
You think Lark's the enemy?

162
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:14,813
You, well, who ever you are.
You're the enemy.

163
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:19,342
You're why the system survives. Why
the suffering goes on! - Shut up!

164
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,929
We don't care about you.
We want Lark!

165
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,147
What if we make a deal?
- Nah, There's no deal, Luther.

166
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:26,453
Step outside!

167
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:30,478
Ethan! - Give me 5 minutes with this guy!
- Ethan, I can't let you do that.

168
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:33,896
That's not who we are.
- Maybe we need to reconsider that!

169
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:37,920
What if they read the manifesto on the air?
- What? You can do that?

170
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:40,015
We can do it with a phone call.

171
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:46,494
Well, if he reader Larks manifesto...
- No! - I'll give you the pass-code.

172
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,732
Ethan! Ethan!

173
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:53,830
Think, Ethan. Think of the greater
good. Please! - Yeah, you do that.

174
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:02,917
OK.

175
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,094
Sir...

176
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,797
No, he won't cooperate.

177
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:12,789
Yes, sir.

178
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,244
If we read the manifesto.

179
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:17,300
On the air.

180
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:21,113
I'm sorry, sir.

181
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,982

some additional information.</i>

183
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,464

185
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:51,010
<i>I've been asked to read this
manifesto in its entirety.</i>

186
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:54,602
<i>There has never been peace
without first a great suffering.</i>

187
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,442
<i>The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.</i>

188
00:14:57,443 --> 00:15:02,340
<i>As mankind is drawn to a self-destruction

humanity from itself.</i>

Well, it's not going

<i>But by averting disaster
they serve to delay peace...</i>

193
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,734
What's done is done.

194
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:23,316
<i>...that can only come trough the inevitable
baptism of fire. The suffering and...</i>

<i>...bringing mutual understanding...</i>

196
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,435

<i>...it's the first step for the

00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:32,691

199
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:37,922
Go.

200
00:15:51,334 --> 00:15:52,594
Did we get it?

201
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,012
Of course we got it!

202
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,346
I told you we'd get it.

203
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:06,686
I don't understand?

204
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:08,607
The attacks didn't happen?

205
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:12,205
The car accident you were
in - that was an hour ago.

206
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,787
I was driving the other car.

207
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:18,707
What's done is done.
When we say it's done.

208
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:07,855
<b><i>IMPOSSIBLE
FALLOUT</i></b>

209
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:24,540
<i>AERIAL BASE RAMSTEIN, GERMANY</i>

210
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:33,586
Sir.

211
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:37,627
That phone you unlocked lead us to a
server in Iceland but we managed

212
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:41,211
to decrypt the communicate between
John Lark and this woman:

213
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:43,711
Alanna Mitsopolis, activist
and philanthropist whose

214
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:46,284
charity work has earned her the
nickname the White Widow.

215
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:49,706
It's all a front for her real trade:
arms dealing, money laundering.

216
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:52,894
Extensive political connections
provide her with protection.

217
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,071
Lark and the Widow
were meeting tonight to

218
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:57,493
negotiate the delivery
of unspecified package.

219
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,406
Which we can only assume
is our missing plutonium.

220
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:03,215
They'll make contact in the private
lounge at the <i>Grand Palais</i> in Paris.

221
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,247
During her annual fund-raising event.
The details are in the file.

222
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:09,498
If Lark isn't there by midnight
the Widow will leave.

223
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:13,154
And sell the package to the highest bidder.
Which gives you...

224
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:15,352
...two hours from
now to find Lark.

225
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:17,691
Sir, I think there’s
something you need to know.

226
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:22,076
I'm gonna stop you right there. You had
a terrible choice to make in Berlin.

227
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,301
Recover the plutonium
or save your team.

228
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:27,052
You chose your team and
now the world's at risk.

229
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:29,872
Some flaw, deep within your
core being simply won't

230
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:32,900
allow you to choose between
one life and millions.

231
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:37,693
You see that as a sign of weakness.
To me, that's your greatest strength.

232
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:40,702
It also tells me I can count on
you to cover my ass.

233
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,783
Because coming here from <i>CIA</i> was a
lateral move. Some say a step down.

234
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,994
But I did it because of you.

235
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:49,563
Don't make me regret it.

236
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,051
Make the call.

237
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:07,897
Shut them down.

238
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:20,043
What do you think
you're doing, Erica?

239
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:23,688
It may be your mission but
this is the <i>CIA</i>- s plane.

240
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:26,400
It doesn't take off without my say-so.
- We don't have time for this.

241
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:30,083
I have a team in Paris ready to grab
Lark as soon as he gets to <i>Palais</i>.

242
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:35,408
A <i>G5</i> standing by to rendition him
to <i>GITMO</i> where waterboard is waiting.

243
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:38,412
Spend 24 hours we don’t have
to pull a confession we can't

244
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:41,440
trust from a man we haven't
positively identified?

245
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:45,071
No. We need reliable
intelligence and we need it now.

246
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,792
This scenario is precisely
why the <i>IMF</i> exists!

247
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:53,231
The <i>IMF</i> is <i>Halloween</i>, Alan. Bunch of grown
men in rubber masks playing <i>Trick or treat</i>.

248
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,339
And if had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin

249
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,812
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

250
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:02,026
And his team would be dead.
- Yes, they would.

251
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:05,390
That's the job. And that's
why I want one of my

252
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:08,877
own men on the scene. To
appraise the situation.

253
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:11,775
Agent Walker,
<i>Special Activities</i>.

254
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:14,668
His reputation precedes.

255
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,086
You use the scalpel.

256
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:18,330
I prefer a hammer.

257
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:21,777
The answer is <i>No</i>. I have
operational authority here.

258
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:24,526
Direct from the President. You have a
problem with that, you take it up with him.

259
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,555
I have already and he agrees with me.
My man goes.

260
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,155
Or no one goes.

261
00:20:37,901 --> 00:20:40,242
No one comes between you
and that plutonium.

262
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:43,450
Not Hunt, not his
team, not anyone.

263
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:04,867
The White Widow has spies in
every level of government.

264
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:09,673
This plain is posing as commercial airliner
so we can jump into France undetected.

265
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,718
Widow’s meeting Lark in a
<i>VIP</i> lounge at midnight.

266
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:16,256
No one can be a bidder without a
pre-issued electronic <i>ID</i> band.

267
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:20,725
We've acquired the unique <i>RFID</i> number for
Larks band allowing us to locate it...

268
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:24,988
...with these. Find that
<i>ID</i> band, you'll find Lark.

269
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:26,977
Then what?

270
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:30,257
Then...

271
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:36,384
I assume his identity. Make contact with
the Widow. She takes us to the package.

272
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,796
People actually
fall for this shit?

273
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:43,521
How do you intend to
make Lark cooperate?

274
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,451
I bump him in the crowd.

275
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:50,075
In 10 seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party.

276
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,496
Incoherent,
completely pliable.

277
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:54,821
After I borrow his face you
walk him out the front door

278
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:56,894
and hand him over to
Sloans extraction team.

279
00:21:56,895 --> 00:22:00,270
You're not getting rid of me that easily,
Hunt. - That's not what this is about.

280
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,443
Sure it is.

281
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:05,030
I know you don't want
me on this detail.

282
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:06,479
But let's face it.

283
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:10,388
If you made the hard choice
in Berlin I wouldn't be here.

284
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:14,051
If you hadn't gun down your <i>Syndicate</i>
agent they sent you to find

285
00:22:14,052 --> 00:22:15,581
I wouldn't be here.

286
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:17,794
That's right. I know all about you.

287
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:22,664
You're why we don't have living witness who
can identify John Lark. Or the Apostles.

288
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:26,659
If you have a problem with my methods
you can always stay behind.

289
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:32,352
Your mission, should you choose to
accept it. Isn't that the thing?

290
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:36,456
<i>Two minutes to decompression.</i>

291
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:37,803
Suite up!

292
00:22:37,804 --> 00:22:40,508
The Widow is meeting
Lark in 30 minutes.

293
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,666
<i>10 seconds to decompression.</i>

294
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,792
Is your oxygen on?

295
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:10,097
There's no atmosphere at this altitude.
I don't need you blacking out on me.

296
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,150
Hey, your heads up display has built-in
guidance system. Follow it to the target.

297
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:20,345
Open your shoot when the system
says. Not before, definitely not after.

298
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:23,763
Or the last thing that goes trough your
mind will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?

299
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:25,069
Crystal.

300
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,709
We gotta talk.
Need to rethink this.

301
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,713
Out of my way, Hunt! - Walker, we have a
problem. There's a storm and we need to...

302
00:23:53,714 --> 00:23:56,402
Enough talk. I'll
see you in Paris!

303
00:23:56,774 --> 00:23:58,079
Shit!

304
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,875
Come on!
Come on!

305
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:20,140
<i>Altitude, 25000 feet.</i>

306
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:30,189
<i>Walker! - What's the matter, Hunt?
Afraid of a little lighting?</i>

307
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:42,054
<i>Altitude, 20000 feet.</i>

308
00:24:42,385 --> 00:24:43,690
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

309
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,365
<i>Walker?</i>

310
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:49,601
<i>Do you copy?</i>

311
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,404
<i>Walker?</i>

312
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,817
<i>Hang on.
Hang on.</i>

313
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:58,766
<i>Walker?</i>

314
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,092
<i>Come on!</i>

315
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:08,726
<i>Altitude, 15000 feet.</i>

316
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:13,421
<i>Walker?</i>

317
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:15,341
<i>Walker?!</i>

318
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:27,548
<i>Walker!</i>

319
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,705
<i>Walker!</i>

320
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,565
<i>Altitude, 10000 feet.</i>

321
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:37,280
<i>9000.</i>

322
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:38,586
<i>Shit!</i>

323
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:42,232
<i>8000.</i>

324
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:46,441
<i>7000.</i>

325
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:51,574
<i>6000.</i>

326
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:56,166
<i>5000.</i>

327
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:00,599
<i>4000.</i>

328
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,852
<i>Walker!</i>

329
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:03,158
<i>Walker!</i>

330
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:05,091
<i>3000.</i>

331
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:10,189
<i>Deploy! Deploy! Deploy!</i>

332
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,910
Oh, God!

333
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:50,176
Looks like you lost your oxygen.

334
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,262
That's where the Widow
is meeting Lark.

335
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:00,829
Walker!

336
00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:04,560
Say again?

337
00:30:01,788 --> 00:30:03,682
The needle?
- Didn't need it.

338
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:05,919
Get him up!

339
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,466
<i>Do not be shy. The
more, the better.</i>

340
00:30:57,467 --> 00:31:02,066
<i>Come on, we're not bad.
- Can we join in? We don't bite.</i>

341
00:32:57,494 --> 00:32:58,799
Shit.

342
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:21,377
Can you still make a mask?
- I need a face to make a mask.

343
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:22,683
Sorry.

344
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:24,602
I was aiming for his chest.

345
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:28,458
What are you doing here?
- It's good to see you too.

346
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:30,800
Sorry, I'm confused. You're?

347
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:34,581
An old friend.

348
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:50,062
Cancel extraction. We're code Blue.

349
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,577
Send sanitation.

350
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:54,920
That was my team.

351
00:33:56,593 --> 00:33:59,898
You didn't answer my question.
What are you doing here?

352
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:04,220
That's it. Just take it easy.
That's it.

353
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:06,199
Just keep your head back
until the bleeding stops.

354
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,794
What is it?!
<i>You want some?!</i>

355
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,093
You're not here by accident.
Who sent you?

356
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,288
I can't tell you that.
- What are you doing?

357
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:19,049
I have a date with White Widow.
- He had a date with the Widow.

358
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,859
You look nothing like him.
- Now, we have to hope they never met.

359
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,810
Hope is not a strategy!
- You must be new.

360
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,972
I have no other choice. White
Widow is our only lead.

361
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:31,162
I got to be this guy for 5 minutes.
- Don't do it.

362
00:34:31,163 --> 00:34:34,239
What?
What is it?

363
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:36,933
What aren't you telling me? - You don't
understand what you're involved in.

364
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:41,739
I don't understand what I'm involved in?
I don't understand what I'm involved in?!

365
00:34:43,935 --> 00:34:48,463
What am I involved in? - If you're meeting
the Widow she leaves in 3 minutes.

366
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:51,424
Ethan!
- I'll make it work.

367
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,797
Ethan!
- I'll make it work!

368
00:34:55,951 --> 00:34:59,433
Name's Walker.
- Yeah? You're welcome.

369
00:35:18,842 --> 00:35:20,837
What do you think you're doing?
- I'm going with you.

370
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:22,955
Like hell you are!
- People have been sent here to kill Lark.

371
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:26,075
No shit.
- No, not me, contractors. Paid assassins.

372
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:27,540
They don't know
what he looks like.

373
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,215
They only know he's meeting
the Widow at midnight.

374
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:31,363
If you go trough with this they're
gonna believe you're Lark

375
00:35:31,364 --> 00:35:33,095
and they're gonna kill you.

376
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:35,023
How do you know all of this?

377
00:35:36,154 --> 00:35:37,710
I can't tell you that.

378
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:42,531
You should've stayed
out of the game.

379
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:46,451
You should've come with me.

380
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:58,044
This charity was started
in honor of my mother.

381
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:01,767
Those of you who knew her
understood her strength.

382
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:04,953
Her tenacity. Her
resourcefulness.

383
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:08,533
But there was another side to her.

384
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,249
The side most people never saw.

385
00:36:11,484 --> 00:36:16,234
It's that part of her spirit that has
brought us all together tonight.

386
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:20,175
Max was something of a paradox.

387
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:25,615
She had a fascination for paradoxes.

388
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:28,734
A fascination she
passed onto me.

389
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:34,784
Max had no illusions about
the world we live in today.

390
00:36:35,384 --> 00:36:38,817
But she had dreams of a
very different future.

391
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:43,240
One in which her unique talents
were no longer required.

392
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:46,500
All she earned from
the way the world is

393
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:50,045
went ultimately to making
it what it could someday be.

394
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:53,570
That future isn't here yet.

395
00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:59,587
Tonight your contributions have
brought it just a little closer.

396
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:06,518
Go with the opportunity.
Enjoy the party.

397
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:30,015
You can't possibly be John Lark?

398
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:35,655
I'm not, actually.

399
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:38,812
It's an alias.

400
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:43,801
I suppose it's better than John Doe.
Is there another name you prefer?

401
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:48,078
Is there somewhere we can talk privately?
- I like Lark. It has a certain ring.

402
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,803
We don't have a lot of time.
- I'll be honest with you.

403
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:53,869
A man with your reputation.
I was expecting someone...

404
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,168
...uglier.

405
00:37:56,389 --> 00:37:59,893
Don't let looks deceive because I'm as ugly
as they come. Now I'll be honest with you.

406
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,406
Your life's in danger.

407
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:06,464
Don't you touch her.
- Relax, he's my brother.

408
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:09,670
You're being rude to our guest, Zola.

409
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:10,976
It's time to go.

410
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:13,319
Don't turn this into a scene.

411
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:17,236
You don't leave this room.

412
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:26,241
You see?
- Your life's in danger.

413
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:30,338
And who'd want to kill me?
- The Americans for starters.

414
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:34,744
Duly noted. - You think you're the
only one with spies in the government?

415
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:38,056
There are people here who don't
want this meeting to happen.

416
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:39,898
Don't believe me?

417
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:41,835
Look around.

418
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:55,551
I know what you're thinking.

419
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:59,654
Maybe they're not here for you.
Maybe they're just here for me.

420
00:38:59,868 --> 00:39:02,216
Are you willing to take that chance?

421
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,966
You have something I want.

422
00:39:05,063 --> 00:39:09,687
Right now that makes me the only person you
can trust to get you out of here alive.

423
00:39:09,688 --> 00:39:12,549
Or would you rather leave
that to your brother?

424
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:19,742
I think I'd like to go home now, Mr. Lark.

425
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,084
The French government will receive
the asset they took in today.

426
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:41,981
Delivery will be by air to the finance
ministry at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning.

427
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:46,038
Another motorcade under heavy police escort
will transport him on along this root.

428
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:49,687
We'll create a diversion at
this intersection. Here.

429
00:41:49,688 --> 00:41:53,882
Motorcade will automatically take the
pre-planned alternate root, here.

430
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:55,878
Where we'll extract the asset.

431
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,236
Extract the asset?

432
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:11,508
The asset?

433
00:42:13,694 --> 00:42:16,317
We've payed a great deal of
money for this information.

434
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:18,957
They gave us everything
but this mans name.

435
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:22,072
You don't happen to
know who he is, do you?

436
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:26,663
His name is Solomon Lane. British
special agent turned anarchist.

437
00:42:28,388 --> 00:42:33,082
He used rogue covert operatives to create
a terror network called the Syndicate.

438
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:37,012
Sabotage, assassination, mass murder...

439
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:39,649
Ugly as they come.

440
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:42,974
He was captured by American
agents two years ago.

441
00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:46,622
Since then he's been under
never-ending interrogation.

442
00:42:46,623 --> 00:42:49,438
Passed around from one
government to another.

443
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,430
To answer for his crimes.

444
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,547
You seem displeased, Lark?

445
00:42:57,563 --> 00:43:00,543
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

446
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:03,892
I came to Paris for plutonium.

447
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:06,417
Well, there must be a misunderstanding.

448
00:43:06,534 --> 00:43:10,582
I'm just a broker. I connect
a buyer and a seller.

449
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:14,991
My seller isn't interested in cash.
So if you want the plutonium...

450
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:19,368
Extract Lane and make a trade.

451
00:43:20,203 --> 00:43:21,508
That's right.

452
00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:28,779
How do I know the seller
has what I want.

453
00:43:47,683 --> 00:43:49,544
A down-payment in good faith.

454
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:53,745
The Currier we'll deliver
two more within 48 hours.

455
00:43:53,746 --> 00:43:57,224
In exchange for him.

456
00:44:04,894 --> 00:44:06,199
All right.

457
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:08,350
What happens after diversion?

458
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,380
Kill everyone?

459
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,225
That's your plan?

460
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:47,494
There'll be no witnesses.

461
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:50,739
What's my guarantee that Lane
walks out of this thing alive?

462
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,514
He's in an armored box.

463
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,009
We'll pull him out
when it's safe.

464
00:45:55,431 --> 00:45:57,374
You want your plutonium?

465
00:45:57,401 --> 00:45:59,307
This is the price.

466
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,533
Or do you draw the
line at killing cops?

467
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:05,927
That's John Lark
you're talking to.

468
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:11,869
I've murdered women and
children with smallpox.

469
00:46:14,177 --> 00:46:16,117
I have no line.

470
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:21,572
Right.

471
00:46:21,673 --> 00:46:24,765
Sleep well, everyone.
Busy day tomorrow.

472
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:47,044
You have got to be kidding me?

473
00:46:47,196 --> 00:46:50,011
If you want Lane out of prison
this is how he gets out.

474
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:52,730
I wanted Lark to brake him
out, not Ethan Hunt.

475
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:56,925
I wanted Lark at the
exchange, not Ethan Hunt.

476
00:46:57,207 --> 00:47:01,512
I wanted Lark to lead us to the
plutonium and the Apostles.

477
00:47:02,182 --> 00:47:03,881
You may still get your chance.

478
00:47:03,882 --> 00:47:06,347
Have you forgotten about the
corpse we pulled out of men's room

479
00:47:06,348 --> 00:47:09,085
at the <i>Grand Palais</i>?
- I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.

480
00:47:09,086 --> 00:47:13,025
More likely one of Larks recruits.
- Not according to our intelligence.

481
00:47:13,026 --> 00:47:14,998
Intelligence gathered by whom?

482
00:47:17,275 --> 00:47:18,580
Hunt.

483
00:47:19,415 --> 00:47:22,832
You long held suspicions that
Lark was an American agent.

484
00:47:22,863 --> 00:47:27,335
Someone who knew our every move.
Someone who could come and go like a ghost.

485
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:31,343
You're suggesting Hunt is John Lark?

486
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:36,171
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

487
00:47:36,476 --> 00:47:37,781
It won't work.

488
00:47:38,132 --> 00:47:43,197
Think about it. Would a man as careful as
Lark really stick his neck out like that?

489
00:47:43,392 --> 00:47:45,975
For a face to face with the White Widow?

490
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:48,630
He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

491
00:47:48,696 --> 00:47:51,516
If he was really smart
he'd had his lady friend

492
00:47:51,517 --> 00:47:54,617
kill that decoy in front
of a reliable witness.

493
00:47:55,134 --> 00:47:56,439
Me.

494
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:59,930
The dragnet is closing down
on his terrorist alter-ego.

495
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:03,992
So he pays a man to play the
part of Lark and has him killed.

496
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,846
And under the guise of
serving his country...

497
00:48:06,847 --> 00:48:10,074
Assumes his own secret identity.

498
00:48:10,092 --> 00:48:14,175
Free to operate at will with the full
support of US government. - Why?

499
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,758
Why would Hunt turn?

500
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:20,364
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his Apostles?

501
00:48:20,759 --> 00:48:23,910
They were believers in a cause.

502
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:28,809
And when that cause turned out to be a
lie they turned against their masters.

503
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:31,741
How many times has Hunts
government betrayed him,

504
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,375
disavowed him, casted him aside?

505
00:48:34,508 --> 00:48:38,676
And how long before a man
like that has had enough?

506
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:42,473
That is a serious accusation.

507
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:45,605
Can you prove it?

508
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:53,327
This is the phone we pulled of the
dead body at the <i>Grand Palais</i>.

509
00:48:58,053 --> 00:49:00,692
I'm guessing it has all
the proof you need.

510
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:07,598
Is it true Lane gassed a
village of 2000 people?

511
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:10,902
Yes.

512
00:51:10,903 --> 00:51:15,208
Is it true he brought down an entire
passenger plane just to kill one man?

513
00:51:15,923 --> 00:51:17,228
Yes.

514
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:21,303
Is it true that he...
- Walker, whatever you heard.

515
00:51:21,304 --> 00:51:24,477
If it makes your skin
crawl, it's probably true.

516
00:51:31,336 --> 00:51:32,641
Holy shit!

517
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:36,988
You're the guy that
caught him, aren't you?

518
00:51:38,584 --> 00:51:41,834
How long do you think he's
gonna keep that to himself?

519
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,797
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

520
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,542
Close it.

521
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,458
What the hell is he doing?

522
00:55:48,568 --> 00:55:50,791
<i>NO SIGNAL</i>

523
00:56:30,673 --> 00:56:33,145
Hunt, <i>where are you?</i>
- Don't wait for me!

524
00:56:34,014 --> 00:56:35,715
<i>Wanna do... What's wrong?</i>

525
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,551
I'll meet you at the garage!

526
00:56:48,046 --> 00:56:49,718
Benji, do you copy?!

527
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:54,095
We copy. Go.<i> - Change of plan.
I'm glued. Need extraction!</i>

528
00:56:54,388 --> 00:56:55,693
We're on our way!

529
00:57:10,434 --> 00:57:12,510
<i>He's driving from Notre
Dame to the Saint</i>

530
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:15,261
<i>Louis bridge. Police
patrols are chasing him.</i>

531
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:37,258
<i>STOP!</i>

532
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:39,036
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

533
01:01:41,384 --> 01:01:42,689
Get in the car.

534
01:01:43,278 --> 01:01:44,583
<i>Nobody move!</i>

535
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:49,196
<i>Show me your hands!</i>

536
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:53,252
<i>Go away, please.</i>

537
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,237
<i>Show me your hands!</i>

538
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,993
<i>Don’t worry, please.</i>

539
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:04,029
<i>Go away, please.</i>

540
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,185
<i>Go away, please.</i>

541
01:02:13,044 --> 01:02:15,181
Zola wants a word with you.

542
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,543
<i>What do we do with her?
- Kill her.</i>

543
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:53,571
<i>You will be fine.</i>

544
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:01,841
<i>You will be fine.</i>

545
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:03,198
We gotta go!

546
01:03:04,216 --> 01:03:06,452
<i>I am so sorry.</i>
- Come on!

547
01:03:43,663 --> 01:03:45,314
The name's Walker by the way.

548
01:03:45,315 --> 01:03:47,479
Was the little car your idea?

549
01:03:57,666 --> 01:03:58,971
Jesus Christ!

550
01:03:59,732 --> 01:04:01,936
What the hell was that?!

551
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,622
Everybody, out!
- Go, go, go!

552
01:06:47,173 --> 01:06:48,478
That was Ilsa.

553
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:50,075
Shut up!

554
01:06:50,508 --> 01:06:51,813
Very interesting.

555
01:06:55,628 --> 01:06:58,058
It's good to see
you again, Ethan.

556
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:37,717
Look who's still alive.

557
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:44,944
There's a microwave tracker in his neck.
- OK. You know what to do.

558
01:07:44,945 --> 01:07:48,472
Let me just assure you
this won't hurt... enough.

559
01:07:50,764 --> 01:07:52,069
90 seconds.

560
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:57,135
You and the Apostles think we're gonna
trade you for the missing plutonium.

561
01:07:57,136 --> 01:07:59,784
I'm here to tell you
that's never gonna happen.

562
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:02,768
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it...

563
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:07,656
I wander, Ethan, did you
ever choose not to?

564
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:12,487
Did you ever stop and ask yourself
who's giving you the orders or why?

565
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:18,129
When everyday the master you serve is
one step closer to ending the world.

566
01:08:18,191 --> 01:08:20,600
Strange accusation coming
from a terrorist.

567
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:23,495
60 seconds. - Terrorists are
schoolboys, desperate for attention.

568
01:08:23,496 --> 01:08:26,776
Hoping to shape public
opinion trough fear.

569
01:08:27,496 --> 01:08:30,699
I don't care in the least
what people think or feel.

570
01:08:31,085 --> 01:08:33,910
In my experience they don't
do either for very long.

571
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:37,825
I suppose that justifies bombing factories
or bringing down civilian aircraft.

572
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:40,076
Or strapping me into
explosive vest!

573
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:43,561
Consider it unfinished business,
my funny little friend.

574
01:08:43,562 --> 01:08:45,034
Luther?
- Almost there.

575
01:08:45,142 --> 01:08:47,443
You see the end as
clearly as I do, Ethan.

576
01:08:47,444 --> 01:08:50,615
Governments the world over
are descending into madness.

577
01:08:50,616 --> 01:08:54,764
The Syndicate was created to
tear them down. Brick by brick.

578
01:08:54,765 --> 01:08:56,646
The Syndicate was a pack
of murdering cowards!

579
01:08:56,647 --> 01:08:59,599
The Syndicate was
civilizations last hope!

580
01:09:00,172 --> 01:09:03,343
A chance to smash the old world order.

581
01:09:04,137 --> 01:09:08,859
That hope is gone now because of
you and your pathetic morality.

582
01:09:10,774 --> 01:09:13,220
You should have
killed me, Ethan.

583
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:19,112
The end you always
feared, it's coming.

584
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:24,288
It's coming.

585
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:27,834
And her blood will
be on your hands.

586
01:09:30,182 --> 01:09:34,925
The fallout.
For all your good intentions.

587
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:43,944
Time!
- Got it!

588
01:10:08,526 --> 01:10:09,831
Get him up!

589
01:10:12,518 --> 01:10:13,823
You're mine now!

590
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:27,831
You're just full of surprises, Lark. - Your
brothers plan was bad from the word <i>go</i>.

591
01:10:27,832 --> 01:10:31,804
You'd lost all your men and Lane
would've been killed in crossfire.

592
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:34,060
I had to improvise.

593
01:10:34,753 --> 01:10:37,003
Why not say that in
the first place?

594
01:10:37,302 --> 01:10:41,052
Because I don't trust your people.
Especially not your brother.

595
01:10:45,049 --> 01:10:46,354
Family,

596
01:10:46,499 --> 01:10:48,418
what can you do?

597
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:52,887
So where's Lane?

598
01:10:53,146 --> 01:10:55,671
Certainly not at the
bottom of the Seine.

599
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:57,642
I have him.
He's safe.

600
01:10:58,094 --> 01:11:00,090
Where do I meet the Currier?

601
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,462
Let's talk about the woman.

602
01:11:05,132 --> 01:11:06,437
Woman?

603
01:11:06,468 --> 01:11:09,567
She was with you at the <i>Palais</i>.
Zola saw her again today.

604
01:11:09,568 --> 01:11:13,596
She tried to kill Lane. She had a
chance to kill you but she didn't.

605
01:11:13,974 --> 01:11:15,279
Why?

606
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:20,577
We have a past.

607
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:22,917
It's complicated.

608
01:11:24,922 --> 01:11:27,616
Well, I'll make it more
complicated for you.

609
01:11:27,799 --> 01:11:29,610
My price just went up.

610
01:11:30,059 --> 01:11:33,476
Someone killed four of my men today.
I assume it was her.

611
01:11:40,279 --> 01:11:42,074
I want her, Lark.

612
01:11:42,813 --> 01:11:44,896
And you're gonna
bring her to me.

613
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:50,639
Otherwise you don't meet the Currier and
the plutonium goes to the highest bidder.

614
01:11:51,171 --> 01:11:53,616
I'd hate for her to
come between us.

615
01:11:57,937 --> 01:11:59,242
She's yours.

616
01:12:00,224 --> 01:12:02,711
At the meeting. Not before.

617
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:16,596
Go to London.

618
01:12:17,255 --> 01:12:19,241
Instructions will follow.

619
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:03,684
I knew if I followed her
you'd show up eventually.

620
01:14:03,685 --> 01:14:04,990
You OK?

621
01:14:07,786 --> 01:14:10,703
Ilsa, I'd never...
- I know you had your reasons.

622
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:13,032
I know.

623
01:14:16,963 --> 01:14:19,841
You need to walk away.
- I can't do that.

624
01:14:21,483 --> 01:14:23,900
You weren't at the
<i>Palais</i> to kill Lark.

625
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:25,355
No.

626
01:14:27,082 --> 01:14:29,054
You were there to protect him.

627
01:14:29,266 --> 01:14:30,571
Yes.

628
01:14:30,743 --> 01:14:33,098
And you killed him
to protect me.

629
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:37,230
You wanted Lark to
break Lane out.

630
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:41,514
No, you needed him
to break Lane out.

631
01:14:42,585 --> 01:14:44,641
Because you have to kill Lane.

632
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,870
Who's making you do this?

633
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,694
<i>MI6</i>.

634
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:55,225
Why?

635
01:14:55,226 --> 01:14:57,548
After we captured him
in London they tried to

636
01:14:57,549 --> 01:15:00,188
bring Lane home trough
diplomatic channels.

637
01:15:00,278 --> 01:15:03,054
But too many countries won't
their pound of flesh.

638
01:15:03,055 --> 01:15:06,955
A man like that, what he's seen. What
he knows about British intelligence.

639
01:15:06,956 --> 01:15:10,148
They can't have him
talking to foreign government, ever.

640
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:12,024
That's not what I'm asking.

641
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,982
Why did they sent you?

642
01:15:15,226 --> 01:15:17,606
This is how I prove my loyalty.

643
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:21,456
This is how I come home.
- But you were out!?

644
01:15:21,848 --> 01:15:24,847
You were free?
- We're never free.

645
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:30,913
I've spent two years undercover with Lane.
To them I'm as much of a threat as he is.

646
01:15:32,506 --> 01:15:36,188
I kill him or I never stop running.

647
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,829
Now, tell me where he is?

648
01:15:45,496 --> 01:15:50,044
I can't help you.
- I'll get to him one way or another.

649
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,843
Please, don't make
me go trough you.

650
01:16:49,832 --> 01:16:50,998
Yes?

651
01:16:50,999 --> 01:16:53,395
Are you here in London?
<i>- I am.</i>

652
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:56,160
Are you ready to meet the Currier?

653
01:16:56,706 --> 01:16:58,806
<i>Yes.
Where do I go?</i>

654
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:01,434
Where would you like to meet?

655
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:05,235
<i>LOCATING CALLER</i>

656
01:17:39,295 --> 01:17:40,600
Mr. Secretary?

657
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:43,420
I've prayed to God
that it wasn't truth.

658
01:17:43,421 --> 01:17:46,044
Well, in his defense, sir,
if Ethan hadn't intervened

659
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:48,160
the great many people
would've been killed.

660
01:17:48,161 --> 01:17:51,035
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that the good people
of Paris and the nation of France

661
01:17:51,036 --> 01:17:54,140
as a whole will take
that into account.

662
01:17:54,563 --> 01:17:56,382
So, what the hell happened?

663
01:18:15,553 --> 01:18:18,358
At which point we were
told to come to London.

664
01:18:18,878 --> 01:18:22,128
And await further instructions.
- And what happens now?

665
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:23,851
Now?

666
01:18:24,842 --> 01:18:26,341
We meet the Widow in 20 minutes.

667
01:18:26,342 --> 01:18:28,801
She's gonna take us to
Currier who'll hand over our

668
01:18:28,802 --> 01:18:31,047
missing plutonium in
exchange for Solomon Lane.

669
01:18:31,048 --> 01:18:32,878
Or in our scenario...

670
01:18:33,888 --> 01:18:35,193
Benji.

671
01:18:35,674 --> 01:18:36,979
Jesus!

672
01:18:37,062 --> 01:18:38,367
I'm sorry, what?

673
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:39,811
Luther and I are gonna
take you to Currier.

674
01:18:39,812 --> 01:18:42,662
Walker stays here and guards the real Lane.
- Absolutely not!

675
01:18:42,663 --> 01:18:45,413
Wait, wait! Why do I have to be Lane?
- Benji.

676
01:18:45,422 --> 01:18:50,286
Our mission, my mission is to recover that
plutonium and I will do so at any cost!

677
01:18:50,287 --> 01:18:53,510
Even if I have to trade Lane.
The real Lane!

678
01:18:53,623 --> 01:18:55,534
And I'll never let him go!

679
01:18:55,568 --> 01:18:58,626
When the Apostles realize
that you're playing games

680
01:18:58,627 --> 01:19:01,207
you'll lose the plutonium.
Again!

681
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:03,044
You let us worry about the Apostles.

682
01:19:03,045 --> 01:19:05,812
As it stands we have
a bigger problem.

683
01:19:05,856 --> 01:19:07,161
A bigger problem.

684
01:19:08,027 --> 01:19:12,405
Ilsa. - Ilsa? Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust?
How's she mixed up in all of this?

685
01:19:12,406 --> 01:19:15,015
She's been ordered to kill Lane.
Direct from <i>MI6</i>.

686
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:19,051
Look. Wait. So that was her in
Paris? On the bike? - Yeah.

687
01:19:19,052 --> 01:19:20,893
Ethan, she tried to kill us!
- No, not us.

688
01:19:20,894 --> 01:19:22,902
Yeah!
- Not us, Lane. She tried to kill Lane.

689
01:19:22,903 --> 01:19:26,113
She has no choice. - And she'll kill me!
- I'm not gonna let that happen!

690
01:19:26,114 --> 01:19:29,308
Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?

691
01:19:30,496 --> 01:19:32,415
I'm working on it.
- Oh, he's working on it.

692
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:33,837
Right now we don't
have a lot of time.

693
01:19:33,838 --> 01:19:35,366
We have to start getting
ready for this meeting.

694
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:37,019
The meeting is a trap.

695
01:19:38,277 --> 01:19:42,694
The White Widow is working with the <i>CIA</i>.
She has been since the beginning.

696
01:19:42,726 --> 01:19:45,530
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock and trade.

697
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,973
Capturing the plutonium and
the Apostles and John Lark

698
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:50,536
buys her a lot of good
will with the Americans.

699
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:53,961
But if Sloan knew the meeting was a
trap why didn't she just tell us?

700
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:57,990
Because in her mind anybody could
be John Lark. Including one of us.

701
01:19:59,112 --> 01:20:01,417
And now her suspicions
are confirmed.

702
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:06,828
According to that dossier a
trail of electronic evidence

703
01:20:06,829 --> 01:20:10,103
connects Hunt to the theft
of smallpox from the <i>CDC</i>.

704
01:20:10,689 --> 01:20:12,962
It also links him to a
lengthy correspondence

705
01:20:12,963 --> 01:20:15,490
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. Debruuk.

706
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:19,352
And of course Hunt handed over the
plutonium to Apostles himself.

707
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:24,570
Now, those facts coupled with a a long and
incriminating history of rogue behavior

708
01:20:24,755 --> 01:20:28,019
collaborate a <i>CIA</i> narrative

709
01:20:28,173 --> 01:20:30,009
that Hunt has snapped.

710
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:35,136
And the search for Lark is nothing but
a cover to hide the fact that Lark...

711
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,178
... Is me.

712
01:20:39,016 --> 01:20:42,039
I gotta hand it to you, Ethan.
Normally when people refer to

713
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:45,456
you as your own worst enemy
it's just a figure of speech.

714
01:20:49,988 --> 01:20:53,071
I'm afraid Sloan got some
questions for her as well.

715
01:20:53,309 --> 01:20:56,059
The Widow offered her
up at no extra charge.

716
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:59,236
And where did Sloan
get this information?

717
01:20:59,615 --> 01:21:01,500
She didn't say.

718
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,200
She did, however, grant me
the opportunity to bring you

719
01:21:04,201 --> 01:21:06,384
in on the condition that I
terminate this mission.

720
01:21:06,385 --> 01:21:08,782
And hand over Solomon
Lane personally.

721
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,831
Sir, you can't do that.
- Hunt! - No, I know

722
01:21:11,843 --> 01:21:13,980
Lane. He has no intention
of going back.

723
01:21:13,981 --> 01:21:18,743
That's why we're taking him back! - Which
means that's exactly what he wont us to do.

724
01:21:18,744 --> 01:21:21,104
Ethan. - Sir, what do you
think, this is a coincidence?

725
01:21:21,105 --> 01:21:23,438
That Sloan just happened to found this?
Lane had it sent to her!

726
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:27,981
He know how she'd react. Just like he knew
the Widow would turn us in. Don't you see?

727
01:21:27,982 --> 01:21:31,510
This, sir.
This is the trap!

728
01:21:31,807 --> 01:21:36,469
We're being directed. - Hunt! - Sir, there
are still two plutonium cores in the wind!

729
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:38,677
And you lost them!

730
01:21:40,669 --> 01:21:43,698
In fairness, sir,
we all lost them.

731
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,748
Respectfully, sir.

732
01:21:45,965 --> 01:21:50,270
You weren't there. - So, making excuses
for him is your full-time job now?!

733
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:53,870
Good God, Ethan. Don't make this
any harder than it already is.

734
01:21:53,871 --> 01:21:56,862
I can no longer protect you!
Don't you understand that?

735
01:21:56,863 --> 01:21:59,840
This is as close as you're ever
gonna get to that plutonium!

736
01:21:59,841 --> 01:22:03,165
Sir, you don't actually believe this?
- I believe I've been given a choice

737
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:06,820
to protect you or the <i>IMF</i>. Which
is why I'm bringing you in.

738
01:22:07,616 --> 01:22:11,257
And if I refuse?
- What do you think he's here for?!

739
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:14,271
You think he's some observer?
He's an assassin!

740
01:22:14,395 --> 01:22:17,002
Erica Sloans number one <i>plumber</i>.

741
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:20,091
You go rogue, he's authorized
to hunt you down...

742
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:21,972
...and kill you.

743
01:22:25,196 --> 01:22:26,401
It's the job.

744
01:22:26,402 --> 01:22:27,707
No hard feeling.

745
01:22:28,154 --> 01:22:31,737
Except it, Ethan. You've lost this one.
What's done is done.

746
01:22:33,471 --> 01:22:34,776
No, sir.

747
01:22:35,107 --> 01:22:36,412
No.

748
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:41,607
I'm not asking you. I'm giving you a
direct order. This mission is terminated.

749
01:22:42,193 --> 01:22:43,498
Now!

750
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:50,667
Stickell, he's your friend. Would you,
please, talk some sense into...

751
01:22:52,322 --> 01:22:54,905
I'm sorry, sir. But you
left me no choice.

752
01:22:57,265 --> 01:22:59,513
There's 15 minutes before we meet
the Widow. You want the plutonium?

753
01:22:59,514 --> 01:23:01,586
We're the only ones who
can get it for you.

754
01:23:01,587 --> 01:23:03,601
You're in or out?!

755
01:23:04,474 --> 01:23:05,611
In.

756
01:23:05,612 --> 01:23:08,110
What are you doing?
- Benji needs to get ready.

757
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:11,805
No! Ethan... - There's no time,
Luther. I need you to trust me.

758
01:23:28,711 --> 01:23:30,016
You're all right?

759
01:23:30,276 --> 01:23:31,581
Yeah, I just...

760
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:34,791
...gotta a bad feeling
about this one.

761
01:24:00,398 --> 01:24:02,259
If you don't hear from us...

762
01:24:02,372 --> 01:24:03,677
I'll do it my way.

763
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,797
Don't take your eyes off him.

764
01:24:46,264 --> 01:24:48,285
Enough games. I'll
take you out of here.

765
01:24:48,286 --> 01:24:49,984
Where's Hunt?

766
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:53,344
He's gone to the meeting. With
a copy of you. - Calm down.

767
01:24:53,345 --> 01:24:56,862
Call the Apostles. Warn them.
- I have no way of contacting them.

768
01:24:56,863 --> 01:24:58,769
For their safety and mine.

769
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:01,016
But I do have an extraction
team and satellite over-watch

770
01:25:01,017 --> 01:25:02,754
at pre-arranged <i>rendezvous</i>.

771
01:25:02,755 --> 01:25:05,161
They'll know as soon as we
leave the building. - No.

772
01:25:05,162 --> 01:25:08,728
I'm staying here.
I haven't finished with Hunt yet.

773
01:25:12,852 --> 01:25:16,478
Why did you have to make this
so fucking complicated?!

774
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:20,129
I don't understand what do you mean?
- The deal was simple.

775
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:23,139
I help you frame Hunt. You
give me plutonium.

776
01:25:23,497 --> 01:25:28,585
You're wasting time! - There can not be
peace without first a great suffering.

777
01:25:29,013 --> 01:25:31,985
The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.

778
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:36,964
When I wrote those words I wasn't referring
to your peace. Or Hunts suffering.

779
01:25:37,736 --> 01:25:41,672
The old world order needs dismantling
and we have the tools to dismantle it.

780
01:25:41,673 --> 01:25:46,014
All you seem to care about is that
Hunt lives to take the blame.

781
01:25:46,253 --> 01:25:49,310
That's not anarchy.
That's revenge.

782
01:25:49,602 --> 01:25:51,410
Yes, it is.

783
01:25:51,722 --> 01:25:56,236
And when I have what I want the
Apostles are getting the plutonium.

784
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:03,026
Hunt's the only friend you've got.
You're only alive today

785
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:05,363
because he didn't have
the guts to kill you!

786
01:26:05,364 --> 01:26:08,108
Sloan is rights. The
<i>IMF</i> is Halloween.

787
01:26:08,304 --> 01:26:10,679
Nothing but grown men wearing...

788
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,215
What?

789
01:26:24,774 --> 01:26:27,890
It's just the job.
No hard feelings.

790
01:26:32,022 --> 01:26:34,217
I've ruined your day, haven't I?

791
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,209
And you were doing so well up until then.

792
01:26:40,505 --> 01:26:42,826
And I think this one's loaded.

793
01:26:43,059 --> 01:26:45,021
You want to find out?

794
01:27:26,959 --> 01:27:29,487
So, how did I do?
- I never had any doubt.

795
01:27:31,296 --> 01:27:33,973
I'm beginning to see why you
guys enjoy this so much.

796
01:27:33,974 --> 01:27:37,060
Hands off, Mr. Secretary.
- Man's a natural.

797
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:39,067
Welcome to the team, sir.

798
01:27:39,365 --> 01:27:41,004
You're making a mistake.

799
01:27:41,181 --> 01:27:45,412
No, the mistake was mine when I
saved your life over Paris.

800
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:48,171
This proves nothing.
I'm playing a role.

801
01:27:48,172 --> 01:27:50,690
Just like you're. Trying
to recover that plutonium.

802
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:54,412
That doesn't explain why you gave Sloan
the dossier and tried to frame Hunt.

803
01:27:54,413 --> 01:27:57,360
He makes a good point, Lark.

804
01:27:57,829 --> 01:28:02,182
He's paranoid. Delusional.
Just like the dossier says.

805
01:28:02,183 --> 01:28:05,600
So where did Sloan get the dossier from?
- I have no idea.

806
01:28:05,867 --> 01:28:07,172
I do.

807
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:13,029
Did you get all that, Erica?
<i>- I did.</i>

808
01:28:13,553 --> 01:28:16,313
<i>I don't appreciate
being used, Walker.</i>

809
01:28:17,676 --> 01:28:19,803
Bad boy.

810
01:28:20,953 --> 01:28:24,203
Where would you like him delivered?
- I'll come to you.

811
01:28:27,113 --> 01:28:30,679
Nobody move!
Put them down! Drop them!

812
01:28:31,163 --> 01:28:33,499
Hands in the air!
Weapons down!

813
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,593
Drop it!
Drop it!

814
01:28:35,907 --> 01:28:38,231
Weapons down! Rights now!
You! - It's OK. - You!

815
01:28:38,232 --> 01:28:40,869
It's OK. - I'm talking
to you! - It's all right.

816
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:44,822
I though we had a deal?
<i>- We did and now we don't.</i>

817
01:28:45,342 --> 01:28:48,696
<i>There's too much at stake here
for me to take any chances.</i>

818
01:28:48,697 --> 01:28:51,839
I'm bringing you all in.
Along with Walker.

819
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:53,481
The plutonium is
still out there!

820
01:28:53,482 --> 01:28:56,054
And I don't trust a living
soul in that room to get it.

821
01:28:56,055 --> 01:28:59,166
<i>We'll sort out who's
who in Washington.</i>

822
01:28:59,757 --> 01:29:01,650
Erica!
- Sir.

823
01:29:01,988 --> 01:29:04,682
It's all right. Let's
just do what she says.

824
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:08,666
The only real threats are in
this room and we have them.

825
01:29:10,969 --> 01:29:12,274
Do you?

826
01:29:13,435 --> 01:29:14,740
Go!

827
01:29:34,579 --> 01:29:35,884
Where are they?!

828
01:30:06,563 --> 01:30:07,868
Ethan!

829
01:30:31,866 --> 01:30:33,894
First team is down.
Send backup.

830
01:30:37,191 --> 01:30:38,496
I can...

831
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:41,194
Oh, no! Man down!

832
01:30:44,049 --> 01:30:45,807
Somebody, help!

833
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:56,046
Sir?

834
01:31:00,462 --> 01:31:04,156
Ethan, I tagged Walker but he's on the run.
You gotta get him.

835
01:31:09,565 --> 01:31:10,870
Go.

836
01:31:11,973 --> 01:31:13,278
I'm sorry, sir.

837
01:31:15,384 --> 01:31:16,689
Go.

838
01:31:27,343 --> 01:31:28,648
Ethan.

839
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:34,001
Wait!

840
01:31:35,307 --> 01:31:36,946
Get that son of a bitch!

841
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:07,497
Come on! Come on!

842
01:32:07,664 --> 01:32:09,191
Yes, I got him!

843
01:32:15,647 --> 01:32:16,952
Back!

844
01:32:20,659 --> 01:32:21,964
I'm sorry.

845
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:24,827
Talk to me, Benji.
Where's Walker?

846
01:32:24,865 --> 01:32:29,170
<i>He's about quarter mile west of you.
Turn right.</i> - Which way? To my right?

847
01:32:31,604 --> 01:32:32,909
I can't do that.

848
01:32:32,979 --> 01:32:34,284
Why not?

849
01:32:35,107 --> 01:32:38,412
Because I'm being followed.
<i>- What do you mean? By who?!</i>

850
01:32:39,036 --> 01:32:42,005
How do I know. <i>CIA</i>, Apostles,
what difference does it make?

851
01:32:42,006 --> 01:32:45,230
<i>OK, OK, just get out of
there and then go right.</i>

852
01:32:53,121 --> 01:32:54,871
I'm terribly sorry.

853
01:32:55,327 --> 01:32:56,632
Excuse me.

854
01:33:13,364 --> 01:33:15,225
Why's he running in circles?

855
01:33:41,955 --> 01:33:45,816
OK, you need to cross the street
on your left as soon as you can.

856
01:33:50,955 --> 01:33:54,260
<i>Did you copy?</i> - Yeah!
<i>- Go left, now!</i> - I'm working on it!

857
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:08,640
<i>OK, now go across the street.
Right in front of you!</i>

858
01:34:14,994 --> 01:34:18,911
<i>Ethan, he's getting away from you.
You're gonna have to go faster!</i>

859
01:34:48,915 --> 01:34:51,109
You're gaining on him!
Go straight.

860
01:34:53,317 --> 01:34:55,289
Straight!
Keep moving straight!

861
01:34:55,506 --> 01:34:58,256
<i>Go straight.
Go straight. Straight! Straight!</i>

862
01:34:58,939 --> 01:35:01,185
<i>OK, now turn right.</i>
- Right?

863
01:35:02,272 --> 01:35:05,065
Now?!<i>
- Yes, right!</i> - Are you sure?!

864
01:35:05,452 --> 01:35:09,821
Yes, I'm...! No it's left! Turn left!
Sorry, I had screen-lock on.

865
01:35:14,221 --> 01:35:15,526
Left?

866
01:35:19,349 --> 01:35:20,654
Thank you.

867
01:35:26,923 --> 01:35:29,965
What are you waiting for?!
- I'm jumping out of a window!

868
01:35:29,966 --> 01:35:32,660
What do you mean you're jumping out of...?!

869
01:35:33,565 --> 01:35:36,564
Oh, sorry I had it in 2D.
Good luck!

870
01:36:11,575 --> 01:36:15,047
At the end of the bridge turn left!
You've almost got him.

871
01:36:17,859 --> 01:36:22,498
Come on, come on, come on! Come on, Ethan!
Get him! You're right on top of him!

872
01:36:36,235 --> 01:36:39,596
That's it! He's right in front of you!
Get him! Get him!

873
01:37:14,466 --> 01:37:16,160
You can't do it, can you?

874
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:18,593
Not until you get your plutonium.

875
01:37:18,923 --> 01:37:21,943
No, he still has plans for you.

876
01:37:23,035 --> 01:37:25,910
You're gonna turn yourself in
and admit you're John Lark.

877
01:37:25,911 --> 01:37:29,495
Then watch the old world implode
from your dark little cell.

878
01:37:29,554 --> 01:37:31,173
And if I don't?

879
01:37:44,267 --> 01:37:46,382
I'm her guardian angel, Hunt.

880
01:37:47,415 --> 01:37:50,218
If I see you again, she dies.

881
01:37:50,249 --> 01:37:53,100
If you try to warn
her, she dies.

882
01:37:53,508 --> 01:37:55,256
Know when you're beat.

883
01:39:06,349 --> 01:39:10,045
These are the designs we recovered from Dr.
Debruuks lab in Berlin.

884
01:39:10,046 --> 01:39:12,431
That's a five mega-ton
nuclear device.

885
01:39:12,518 --> 01:39:15,114
That's greater than all the
explosive energy released in <i>WW2</i>.

886
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:18,270
To disarm it normally we'd
cut the fuse wire here.

887
01:39:18,783 --> 01:39:23,351
What? Normally?
- Walker and Lane have two plutonium cores.

888
01:39:23,641 --> 01:39:27,189
Meaning two bombs. - Yeah, and they're
both linked by microwave fail-safe

889
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:29,280
which is accurate to
within 1/10 of a second.

890
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:33,139
Any attempt to defuse one bomb
automatically triggers the other.

891
01:39:33,546 --> 01:39:36,764
Meaning once armed the
bombs can't be disarmed.

892
01:39:36,814 --> 01:39:41,119
The countdown is started by a remote
detonator which is also a fail-safe.

893
01:39:41,326 --> 01:39:43,663
Meaning once the
countdown starts...

894
01:39:44,056 --> 01:39:45,881
...it can't be stopped.

895
01:39:47,237 --> 01:39:49,511
So solution for this is?

896
01:39:51,921 --> 01:39:53,659
We're working on it.

897
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:56,375
So...

898
01:39:56,766 --> 01:39:59,361
Technically this is
a suicide mission?

899
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:11,716
What is it?

900
01:40:11,717 --> 01:40:14,119
Come and see.
Please.

901
01:40:18,111 --> 01:40:23,210
In all the years that I've known Ethan
he's only been serious about two women.

902
01:40:24,147 --> 01:40:26,091
One was his wife.

903
01:40:26,941 --> 01:40:30,211
He's married?
- No, he was.

904
01:40:30,646 --> 01:40:32,430
Was? What happened to her?

905
01:40:32,946 --> 01:40:36,700
Well, she was taken by some people
who wanted to get to Ethan.

906
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:39,853
It's OK. He got her
back in one piece.

907
01:40:40,521 --> 01:40:42,822
Then he quit the game.

908
01:40:43,055 --> 01:40:45,169
They were happy for a while.

909
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:48,437
But every time something
bad happened in the world

910
01:40:48,438 --> 01:40:51,132
Ethan would think: <i>I
should have been there</i>.

911
01:40:51,426 --> 01:40:56,235
And she would wonder: <i>Who's watching
the world while Ethan is watching me?</i>

912
01:40:56,654 --> 01:40:59,663
Deep down they both knew
that someday, somehow,

913
01:40:59,664 --> 01:41:02,828
something truly terrible
was going to happen.

914
01:41:04,341 --> 01:41:06,872
All because they were together.

915
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:08,985
So...

916
01:41:11,194 --> 01:41:15,046
Where is she now?
- She's a ghost. Good at it too.

917
01:41:15,865 --> 01:41:17,689
Taught her myself.

918
01:41:18,101 --> 01:41:21,720
Every now and then she sends up a
signal to let Ethan know she's safe.

919
01:41:21,721 --> 01:41:23,459
And that keeps him going.

920
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:27,171
Why are you telling me this?

921
01:41:30,936 --> 01:41:34,130
We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.

922
01:41:36,537 --> 01:41:38,782
He's a good man.

923
01:41:39,018 --> 01:41:42,846
And he cares about you.
More than he can admit.

924
01:41:43,792 --> 01:41:47,233
That's one more worry than
he can handle right now.

925
01:41:50,011 --> 01:41:54,328
If you care about him,
you should walk away.

926
01:41:57,878 --> 01:41:59,183
If only...

927
01:41:59,204 --> 01:42:00,509
Serves me right.

928
01:42:13,157 --> 01:42:14,629
I'm coming with you.

929
01:42:23,597 --> 01:42:24,902
I know.

930
01:42:29,011 --> 01:42:30,594
So, how do we find him?

931
01:42:31,843 --> 01:42:36,339
Microwave transponder. Traceable via
satellite anywhere in the world.

932
01:42:36,661 --> 01:42:39,466
Lane had one of these in
the back of his neck.

933
01:42:39,534 --> 01:42:40,870
We removed it in Paris.

934
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:43,905
Same time, we put our own transponder in.
- Got it!

935
01:42:46,195 --> 01:42:50,955
36 hour delayed activation. In
case Lanes Apostles scan him.

936
01:42:52,396 --> 01:42:56,473
So you planned on letting him go?
- Not this way, but yes.

937
01:42:56,954 --> 01:43:00,235
He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.
- How can you be sure?

938
01:43:00,236 --> 01:43:02,819
His plan to put me in
prison went to hell.

939
01:43:03,605 --> 01:43:06,133
Now he's gonna want
me there for the end.

940
01:43:06,488 --> 01:43:09,608
So when does this transponder activate...
- I got it! I got it! I got it!

941
01:43:09,609 --> 01:43:12,934
He's traveling east over Europe at 500 mph.
- He's airborne.

942
01:43:12,935 --> 01:43:14,690
Should we inform the <i>CIA</i>?

943
01:43:14,925 --> 01:43:18,842
<i>CIA</i> has been infiltrated. I don't
trust anybody outside this room.

944
01:43:19,191 --> 01:43:21,108
We're gonna have to go alone.

945
01:43:23,815 --> 01:43:25,370
So, where do we go?

946
01:43:45,293 --> 01:43:46,876
How're we doing, Benji?

947
01:43:47,057 --> 01:43:49,978
If there's a way to defuse
this bombs I can't find it.

948
01:43:49,979 --> 01:43:52,340
You'll figure it out.
I know you will.

949
01:43:53,585 --> 01:43:55,840
Damn! Ethan, we've
lost the signal.

950
01:43:56,418 --> 01:43:58,549
Lane must have found
our transmitter.

951
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:01,744
What's his last position?
- About 30 miles north-east.

952
01:44:01,889 --> 01:44:04,139
Than that's where
he wants us to go.

953
01:44:04,355 --> 01:44:07,795
What's there? - The Nubra river valley.
There's only a medical camp there.

954
01:44:07,796 --> 01:44:09,948
<i>Humanitarian Aid Overseas</i>.

955
01:44:10,568 --> 01:44:13,191
Why would Lane target
a medical camp?

956
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:15,435
Smallpox.

957
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:20,508
What? - Smallpox. The Apostles triggered
smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.

958
01:44:20,509 --> 01:44:23,481
Lane must've wanted that
camp there for a reason.

959
01:44:23,495 --> 01:44:27,087
But what?
- Oh my God! - What is it?

960
01:44:28,039 --> 01:44:31,400
Well, the Nubra river is at
the base of Siachen glacier.

961
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:33,683
So nuclear blast there
would irradiate the

962
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:36,545
largest natural irrigation
system in the world.

963
01:44:36,856 --> 01:44:40,946
Fresh water from the border
of China to India and Pakistan.

964
01:44:42,091 --> 01:44:44,297
They're gonna starve one third
of the worlds population!

965
01:44:44,298 --> 01:44:46,333
The greater the suffering...

966
01:44:46,334 --> 01:44:48,486
... The greater the peace.

967
01:44:49,014 --> 01:44:51,813
I still don't understand why
Lane wants a medical camp there.

968
01:44:51,814 --> 01:44:56,030
It doesn't matter. All that matters now is
that we find a way to defuse those bombs.

969
01:44:56,031 --> 01:44:57,959
I think I've found it.

970
01:44:58,215 --> 01:45:02,193
Maybe. But there appears to a
flaw in bombs operating system.

971
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:05,687
The remote detonator requires that
firing key. If you remove that key

972
01:45:05,688 --> 01:45:09,535
then it should short-out the fail-safe
and allow us to cut both fuses.

973
01:45:09,536 --> 01:45:12,529
So one of us needs to get the
detonator and remove that key.

974
01:45:12,530 --> 01:45:15,884
Yeah, while... - While the rest of
us cut the fuses on both bombs.

975
01:45:15,885 --> 01:45:18,347
Simple.
- Yeah, but...

976
01:45:18,736 --> 01:45:19,970
But what?

977
01:45:19,971 --> 01:45:23,427
Well in order to make this
work we can't remove the key

978
01:45:23,428 --> 01:45:26,858
or cut the fuses until after
the countdown starts.

979
01:45:28,087 --> 01:45:31,228
Wait, wait! Just so I got this clear.
Our only chance to safely defuse

980
01:45:31,229 --> 01:45:34,596
both bombs is to let
the countdown start?

981
01:45:35,225 --> 01:45:37,840
And then remove that key.

982
01:45:46,407 --> 01:45:47,712
OK.

983
01:46:05,432 --> 01:46:08,450
Both devices are now
connected to the detonator.

984
01:46:09,839 --> 01:46:13,978
15 minutes should give you enough
time to reach minimum safe distance.

985
01:46:16,281 --> 01:46:18,442
My running days are over.

986
01:46:19,452 --> 01:46:21,471
This is where it ends for me.

987
01:46:50,601 --> 01:46:52,665
I'm getting signals
all over the place.

988
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:54,824
That's why the medical camp.
X-ray machines,

989
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:57,883
CAT-scanners, radiological
signatures everywhere.

990
01:46:57,884 --> 01:47:00,214
Looks like a needle in a haystack.
- Process of elimination.

991
01:47:00,215 --> 01:47:03,413
One at a time. Let's split up.
Stay on comms.

992
01:47:13,463 --> 01:47:14,768
Ethan?

993
01:47:20,421 --> 01:47:21,726
Julia?

994
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:27,735
Is that?

995
01:47:31,777 --> 01:47:33,082
Julia!

996
01:47:35,334 --> 01:47:36,639
Does he know?

997
01:47:38,243 --> 01:47:41,276
Hey.
- This is my husband, Eric.

998
01:47:41,822 --> 01:47:44,889
This is...
- Rob, Rob Thorn. Dr. Rob Thorn.

999
01:47:45,315 --> 01:47:49,048
I worked with Julia at...
- Mass General, before New York.

1000
01:47:49,225 --> 01:47:53,776
Oh, you're kidding? What a coincidence? - I
know. I... - What brings you all this way?

1001
01:47:53,777 --> 01:47:56,360
I was in Turtuk, not far from here.

1002
01:47:56,675 --> 01:47:59,252
And heard help is needed.

1003
01:47:59,526 --> 01:48:02,342
Oh, well... Actually we're
just about finished here.

1004
01:48:02,343 --> 01:48:05,321
The whole village
is inoculated but...

1005
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:07,785
What were you doing at Turtuk?

1006
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:09,869
Rob's on vacation.

1007
01:48:10,046 --> 01:48:12,731
No... No, I'm working.

1008
01:48:14,942 --> 01:48:16,803
You're a long way from home.

1009
01:48:17,015 --> 01:48:19,712
Yeah, yeah. Thanks to
our guardian angel.

1010
01:48:19,881 --> 01:48:20,946
Guardian?

1011
01:48:20,947 --> 01:48:23,557
Well, yeah. We were running a
field hospital outside of Darfur

1012
01:48:23,558 --> 01:48:25,123
when outbreak happened here.

1013
01:48:25,124 --> 01:48:28,401
Here comes this phone call from an
anonymous donor. Out of the blue.

1014
01:48:28,402 --> 01:48:32,819
And he says he's ready to underwrite
the entire operation. One condition...

1015
01:48:33,212 --> 01:48:35,393
We run the whole thing.

1016
01:48:35,607 --> 01:48:37,079
Can you believe that?

1017
01:48:37,798 --> 01:48:39,501
I certainly can.

1018
01:48:40,513 --> 01:48:43,121
Out of the blue.
- Out of the blue.

1019
01:48:45,351 --> 01:48:49,582
It's quite a full life. - Yeah, you
know before Julia I never traveled.

1020
01:48:49,664 --> 01:48:51,041
<i>I never even left New York.</i>

1021
01:48:51,042 --> 01:48:55,043
<i>Never left the hospital. 7 days
a week, overtime, no vacations.</i>

1022
01:48:55,225 --> 01:48:57,124
Ethan, I think I found something.

1023
01:48:57,125 --> 01:49:00,606
<i>I was just patient checking. You keep
the circuit at 50. Heart attack at 55.</i>

1024
01:49:00,607 --> 01:49:03,425
And she convinced me
to let it all go.

1025
01:49:03,997 --> 01:49:07,802
Help where it's needed most. So
we've been on the go ever since.

1026
01:49:08,085 --> 01:49:10,113
I've never been more fulfilled.

1027
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:13,001
I'm happy for you.

1028
01:49:14,053 --> 01:49:15,358
<i>Right there.</i>

1029
01:49:17,099 --> 01:49:20,571
Well, we should get going. We
have a lot of packing to do.

1030
01:49:20,673 --> 01:49:22,576
Oh, no. I'll handle that.
You two should catch up.

1031
01:49:22,577 --> 01:49:24,294
Oh no, I should get
out of your hair.

1032
01:49:24,295 --> 01:49:26,569
Are you kidding? You
should stick around.

1033
01:49:26,570 --> 01:49:29,542
I'm just sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

1034
01:49:30,796 --> 01:49:35,426
I'll tell you what. We'll pack and why
don't we give you a ride back to Turtuk.

1035
01:49:35,427 --> 01:49:37,382
You two can catch up in the car.

1036
01:49:37,383 --> 01:49:38,645
Yeah?

1037
01:49:38,646 --> 01:49:39,951
You're very kind.

1038
01:49:40,902 --> 01:49:42,207
Settled.

1039
01:49:42,267 --> 01:49:43,572
See you soon.

1040
01:49:45,187 --> 01:49:46,770
It was good to see you.

1041
01:49:47,704 --> 01:49:50,742
I'm so sorry, Julia.
I'm so sorry.

1042
01:50:12,148 --> 01:50:13,908
Take those helicopters.

1043
01:50:14,903 --> 01:50:16,951
No one else leaves.

1044
01:50:25,021 --> 01:50:26,917
Careful, careful, careful.

1045
01:50:31,269 --> 01:50:33,712
It's armed but the countdown
hasn't started yet.

1046
01:50:33,713 --> 01:50:36,261
The network signal's strong which
means the other device is close by.

1047
01:50:36,262 --> 01:50:39,892
And the detonator.
By half km in that direction.

1048
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:42,726
They're still here.

1049
01:50:43,649 --> 01:50:46,899
Luther, you keep working on it.
You two, come with me!

1050
01:50:47,756 --> 01:50:49,854
Oh, sure. I've got this.

1051
01:50:50,486 --> 01:50:52,403
Don't worry about old Luther.

1052

01:53:41,546 --> 01:53:43,190
Oh my God!

1073
01:53:43,541 --> 01:53:46,347
Is that what I think it is?
<i>- Luther, get her out of there!</i>

1074
01:53:46,348 --> 01:53:47,966
Where's she gonna go?

1075
01:53:49,010 --> 01:53:49,989
All right.

1076
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:51,295
What can I do?

1077
01:53:53,386 --> 01:53:56,599
In the kit. The pliers with the red grip.
<i>- Are you insane?!</i>

1078
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:59,572
Mind your business, Benji!
- This is my business!

1079
01:55:42,885 --> 01:55:44,635
<i>Benji, do you copy?</i>
- Ethan?

1080
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:48,306
Ethan, where are you?
- I'm in a helicopter going after Walker.

1081
01:55:48,307 --> 01:55:50,361
<i>Hold on!</i>
How did you get in the helicopter?

1082
01:55:50,362 --> 01:55:53,030
What? You can fly a helicopter?!
- Did you say helicopter?

1083
01:55:53,031 --> 01:55:54,781
What the hell are you
doing in a helicopter?

1084
01:55:54,782 --> 01:55:58,124
<i>Did you...?</i> Hey, did you
find the other bomb?

1085
01:55:58,125 --> 01:55:59,964
<i>Well, we're still looking</i>
but finding the bomb

1086
01:55:59,965 --> 01:56:01,856
isn't gonna matter unless
we have the detonator.

1087
01:56:01,857 --> 01:56:04,385
I know, I know. I'll get it.
I'll get it!

1088
01:56:04,387 --> 01:56:06,780
<i>If he's in another
helicopter...</i>

1089
01:56:06,933 --> 01:56:09,074
...how're you gonna get it?
<i>- I'll figure it out.</i>

1090
01:56:09,075 --> 01:56:12,880
You find the bomb. I'll get the detonator.
I won't let you down.

1091
01:56:14,055 --> 01:56:15,527
I won't let you down.

1092
01:56:15,775 --> 01:56:20,576
<i>Be ready.</i>
- Look, Ethan. Ethan! Ethan, come in!

1093
01:56:20,646 --> 01:56:23,290
Benji!<i>
- Come in!</i> - Benji! Luther!

1094
01:56:23,743 --> 01:56:25,048
Anybody?

1095
01:56:26,516 --> 01:56:28,407
I can do this.
I can do this!

1096
01:56:28,699 --> 01:56:31,385
What do we got here?
We got airspeed.

1097
01:56:31,655 --> 01:56:35,272
Airspeed. OK, power.
This is power.

1098
01:56:42,237 --> 01:56:44,820
Payload! How do I get
rid of this payload?

1099
01:56:46,607 --> 01:56:47,912
<i>PAYLOAD</i>

1100
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:54,892
Power!

1101
01:57:09,137 --> 01:57:11,364
Wire stripper.
- I'm a doctor, not an electrician.

1102
01:57:11,365 --> 01:57:14,166
Sorry.
- The thing with a green grip.

1103
01:57:14,228 --> 01:57:16,768
Got it. - The wire in my left hand.
- The black one?

1104
01:57:16,769 --> 01:57:20,468
My left hand. - That's your left hand.
- Sorry, the other wire!

1105
01:57:20,469 --> 01:57:24,274
The red one? - Yes, the red one in
my right hand. - Just checking.

1106
01:57:24,478 --> 01:57:26,136
I like her.

1107
01:57:39,362 --> 01:57:41,167
Hold this for me, will you?

1108
01:57:43,837 --> 01:57:45,142
Shit!

1109
01:57:49,217 --> 01:57:50,522
Dammit!

1110
01:57:51,353 --> 01:57:52,658
Get up there!

1111
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,545
That's right.

1112
01:58:03,054 --> 01:58:04,359
Prick!

1113
01:58:13,733 --> 01:58:15,038
Shit!

1114
01:58:20,878 --> 01:58:22,183
Son of a bitch!

1115
01:58:25,162 --> 01:58:26,467
Got it!

1116
01:58:34,966 --> 01:58:36,694
Do it!
Do it!

1117
01:58:37,466 --> 01:58:38,466
Shit!

1118
01:58:38,467 --> 01:58:41,523
<i>Pull up!
Pull up!</i>

1119
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:45,925
<i>Delaying! Delaying!
Pull up! Pull up!</i>

1120
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:51,324
I'm trying, I'm trying!
<i>Delaying! Delaying!</i>

1121
01:59:08,443 --> 01:59:11,770
I can not find anything. I think
we're looking in the wrong place.

1122
01:59:11,771 --> 01:59:14,555
Signature's everywhere. This is
the perfect place to hide it.

1123
01:59:14,556 --> 01:59:15,940
That's the point. I know Lane.

1124
01:59:15,941 --> 01:59:17,580
If we're looking here...

1125
01:59:18,317 --> 01:59:20,348
It's because he wants us to.

1126
01:59:23,159 --> 01:59:26,298
I'm heading to village.
- Just wait for me. Alright?

1127
01:59:29,715 --> 01:59:31,991
Ilsa, I think I found something.

1128
01:59:35,613 --> 01:59:38,122
Cut this wire, right here.

1129
01:59:38,964 --> 01:59:43,315
Turn that screw
counterclockwise very slowly.

1130
01:59:46,119 --> 01:59:47,424
So...

1131
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:50,355
How's he?

1132
01:59:50,356 --> 01:59:53,419
Well, you know. Same old Ethan.

1133
02:00:02,971 --> 02:00:04,276
Jesus!

1134
02:00:07,766 --> 02:00:08,993
Shit!

1135
02:00:08,994 --> 02:00:10,907
No, no, no!

1136
02:00:19,172 --> 02:00:20,413
Benji, I see Lane now.

1137
02:00:20,414 --> 02:00:23,334
What?! Where? - He's in a house
at the enter to the village.

1138
02:00:23,335 --> 02:00:25,363
Alright. Just wait for me. OK?

1139
02:00:25,638 --> 02:00:27,014
<i>Ilsa, wait for me!</i>

1140
02:00:37,171 --> 02:00:38,476
No!

1141
02:00:43,715 --> 02:00:45,020
Nuclear bomb.

1142
02:00:56,025 --> 02:00:57,330
Dammit!

1143
02:01:40,257 --> 02:01:42,229
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1144
02:01:42,567 --> 02:01:45,039
Ilsa, where are you?!
- I'm in a house...

1145
02:02:08,019 --> 02:02:10,158
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?!

1146
02:02:10,189 --> 02:02:13,550
You're out of your mind!
I don't know what's down there!

1147
02:02:17,695 --> 02:02:19,140
Pull up!
Pull up!

1148
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:32,269
This crazy son of a bitch
is trying to ram us! Go!

1149
02:02:50,047 --> 02:02:51,352
Yes!

1150
02:02:51,664 --> 02:02:56,303
Benji, come in. We're almost at the fuse.
We need to find that other bomb, now!

1151
02:02:57,414 --> 02:03:00,562
Did you say other bomb?
<i>- Benji, do you read me?</i>

1152
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:02,145
I'm working on it!

1153
02:03:02,474 --> 02:03:04,260
Ilsa, where are you?!

1154
02:03:22,243 --> 02:03:27,458
He can't stop it.
Understand? There's nothing he can do.

1155
02:03:27,566 --> 02:03:31,094
When the clock runs out Ethan
Hunt will loose everything...

1156
02:03:31,957 --> 02:03:33,663
And everyone...

1157
02:03:34,656 --> 02:03:36,742
...he ever cared about.

1158
02:03:38,094 --> 02:03:40,201
<i>Ilsa, Ilsa!</i>
- Benji!

1159
02:03:40,675 --> 02:03:43,045
Benji!<i>
- Ilsa, where are you?!</i>

1160
02:03:44,537 --> 02:03:46,467
You don't want to see this.

1161
02:03:48,156 --> 02:03:49,461
Benji!

1162
02:03:49,769 --> 02:03:51,074
<i>Ilsa?</i>
- Benji!

1163
02:03:51,343 --> 02:03:53,123
Benji, release me!

1164
02:03:53,478 --> 02:03:54,923
No, no!

1165
02:04:22,847 --> 02:04:24,152
Benji!

1166
02:04:48,749 --> 02:04:51,551
No, no, no!

1167
02:05:30,759 --> 02:05:32,509
Stay with me!
Stay with me!

1168
02:05:35,448 --> 02:05:39,642
No! Not when I'm this close. Not when
I'm this close! Come on! Come on!

1169
02:05:40,427 --> 02:05:41,732
Yes!

1170
02:07:25,207 --> 02:07:26,154
Thank you.

1171
02:07:26,155 --> 02:07:27,460
Tie him up.

1172
02:08:31,178 --> 02:08:33,821
Why won't you just die?

1173
02:08:55,683 --> 02:08:57,766
There's nothing else you can do.

1174
02:08:59,074 --> 02:09:00,836
Go be with your husband.

1175
02:09:02,228 --> 02:09:03,533
Luther...

1176
02:09:04,088 --> 02:09:05,393
Go.

1177
02:09:18,808 --> 02:09:20,163
Benji, where are you?

1178
02:09:20,164 --> 02:09:21,787
OK, Luther, we're inside.
Tell us what to do.

1179
02:09:21,788 --> 02:09:24,456
<i>You should keep the red wire
attached to the motherboard.</i> - Yeah.

1180
02:09:24,457 --> 02:09:28,374
You need to cut that and the green
wire next to it simultaneously.

1181
02:09:29,424 --> 02:09:31,950
OK. Ready? Set?
Cut.

1182
02:09:34,079 --> 02:09:38,281
I told you it can't be stopped.
There's nothing you can do.

1183
02:12:56,509 --> 02:13:00,287
<i>Benji, listen.</i> Turn the screw
counterclockwise. - Yup.

1184
02:13:01,776 --> 02:13:06,375
<i>Remove that panel and you'll see the power
and ground wires for the fuse.</i> - Got it.

1185
02:13:06,376 --> 02:13:11,520
When the time comes cut the green wire.
<i>Do not cut it yet!</i> - OK, we copy.

1186
02:13:16,859 --> 02:13:20,144
Ethan, if you can hear me,
we're ready to make the cut.

1187
02:13:20,145 --> 02:13:21,450
Ethan, come in!

1188
02:13:21,709 --> 02:13:24,649
Benji, how do we know
if he's got the key?

1189
02:13:24,964 --> 02:13:28,852
<i>He'll get it.</i> - Yeah, but how do we know?
- He'll get it done!

1190
02:13:35,076 --> 02:13:36,845
We're out of time! We just
have to hope he has it!

1191
02:13:36,846 --> 02:13:39,002
OK. We're ready.
<i>- Two seconds we cut!</i>

1192
02:13:39,003 --> 02:13:41,828
Wait, wait! Why two? Why not one?
- You want to cut it that close?

1193
02:13:41,829 --> 02:13:43,416
Well, it's the second
we'll never get back!

1194
02:13:43,417 --> 02:13:46,073
Wait! Can we make a decision on this?!
- Alright! We'll do it on one!

1195
02:13:46,074 --> 02:13:48,824
Cutting on one?
- Yes, one! Alright, stand by.

1196
02:13:51,153 --> 02:13:55,059
3, 2, 1, now!

1197
02:14:33,668 --> 02:14:34,973
OK.

1198
02:14:46,157 --> 02:14:47,462
My man.

1199
02:15:40,861 --> 02:15:42,166
Ethan?

1200
02:15:45,815 --> 02:15:47,120
Can you hear me?

1201
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:52,672
No, don't, don't.

1202
02:15:53,345 --> 02:15:54,650
Don't try to move.

1203
02:15:55,077 --> 02:15:56,138
Don't move.

1204
02:15:56,139 --> 02:15:57,778
You're pretty banged up.

1205
02:16:00,787 --> 02:16:02,069
You're a lucky man.

1206
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:05,034
It's a miracle that crash
didn't kill you Dr. Thorn.

1207
02:16:05,035 --> 02:16:08,234
If your friend didn't find you an
hour later you would've died from exposure.

1208
02:16:08,235 --> 02:16:10,251
My friend?
- Yeah.

1209
02:16:12,725 --> 02:16:15,030
She got here not
long after you left.

1210
02:16:15,369 --> 02:16:17,786
Right in front of
half the Indian army.

1211
02:16:18,419 --> 02:16:21,058
Can you give us just a
few minutes, please?

1212
02:16:22,775 --> 02:16:24,946
See you later, doc.

1213
02:16:31,369 --> 02:16:32,674
Julia,

1214
02:16:34,031 --> 02:16:35,336
I'm sorry.

1215
02:16:36,008 --> 02:16:38,603
There's no reason to be sorry.
- No.

1216
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:40,205
I'm sorry...

1217
02:16:41,672 --> 02:16:43,200
...for everything.
I...

1218
02:16:45,344 --> 02:16:46,649
Look at me.

1219
02:16:47,655 --> 02:16:48,960
Look at me.

1220
02:16:49,307 --> 02:16:51,421
Look at my life.

1221
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:58,023
I love what I do and I never would've
found this if I hadn't met you.

1222
02:16:58,984 --> 02:17:01,476
Everything that happened...

1223
02:17:01,926 --> 02:17:07,936
...though me a way and showed
me what I'm capable of and I...

1224
02:17:08,464 --> 02:17:10,782
I'm a survivor.

1225
02:17:11,271 --> 02:17:13,647
But what happened here...

1226
02:17:14,002 --> 02:17:17,754
It was my...
- Nothing happened. Because you were here.

1227
02:17:20,145 --> 02:17:24,618
And I sleep soundly at night
knowing you always will be.

1228
02:17:32,921 --> 02:17:34,226
You're happy?

1229
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:35,665
Very.

1230
02:17:39,012 --> 02:17:41,506
I'm exactly where I should be.

1231
02:17:43,528 --> 02:17:46,190
And so are you.

1232
02:18:24,673 --> 02:18:26,302
Per your request.

1233
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:30,844
I'm handing Solomon
Lane back to <i>MI6</i>.

1234
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:37,911
Trough a broker, of course.

1235
02:18:39,843 --> 02:18:42,649
Part of our ongoing arrangement.

1236
02:18:47,865 --> 02:18:49,802
After what happened in Paris

1237
02:18:50,438 --> 02:18:53,292
we prefer to keep a low profile.

1238
02:18:55,390 --> 02:19:00,474
And that closes your friends
account with British intelligence.

1239
02:19:01,675 --> 02:19:04,349
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1240
02:19:04,612 --> 02:19:07,867
I understand now why
Hunley believed in you.

1241
02:19:08,377 --> 02:19:11,157
The world needs the <i>IMF</i>.

1242
02:19:11,521 --> 02:19:13,803
We need people like you.

1243
02:19:13,804 --> 02:19:16,143
Who care about the one life

1244
02:19:16,674 --> 02:19:20,021
as much as they care
about the millions.

1245
02:19:21,367 --> 02:19:24,727
That way I never have to.

1246
02:19:25,576 --> 02:19:26,881
You're OK?

1247
02:19:27,919 --> 02:19:30,063
You've never looked better.
- Don’t!

1248
02:19:32,713 --> 02:19:34,712
How close were we?

1249
02:19:37,146 --> 02:19:38,451
The usual.

1250
02:19:42,730 --> 02:19:44,035
Usual?

1251
02:19:45,773 --> 02:19:47,909
Please, don't make me lough.
