1
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,716
And finally...

2
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,019
How do you fit 30 Iraqis
in one telephone booth?

3
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,297
Tell them that it
does not belong to them!

4
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,836
Goodbye!

5
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:54,998
Congratulations!

6
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,574
You're very kind, Excellency.

7
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,337
Oh, I'm a mere Prince, Ranjit.

8
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,044
Answerable to His Excellency.

9
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,170
The Emir.

10
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,213
But Ranjit,
you know this deal would mean...

11
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,945
...a lot of your friends
will be unhappy with you.

12
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,120
So, how do you explain to them?

13
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,153
To me, profit explains every1hing.

14
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,221
Every1hin9-

15
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,089
Always the shrewd businessman.

16
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,560
You should rule, Your Excellency
and let me slave in peace.

17
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,595
Allah be with you.

18
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,863
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

19
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,076
Heemaar!

20
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,077
Sorry, sir?

21
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,943
Donkey, Nair, Donkey!

22
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,815
Your India is fully of them

23
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,849
But seems like only
I run into them in Kuwait.

24
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,117
Play some music.
- Okay, sir.

25
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,829
Nair, you're still not a Kuwaiti.

26
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,628
Haven't you learnt anything from me.

27
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:55,858
Sorry, sir.

28
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,026
Thank you.

29
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,808
Just have a little.

30
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,319
Simu, that's it

31
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,946
Goodnight.
- No, mama...five minutes.

32
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,217
No five minutes, that's it.

33
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,690
Simu.

34
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,057
Simu. Come on, jump. Jump. Jump.

35
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,620
Jump. Jump. Jump.

36
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,293
Goodnight.

37
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,630
Where's my kiss.

38
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,158
Goodnight.

39
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,200
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Don't be scared.

40
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:34,966
Rita.

41
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,132
Yes, ma'am.
- Just tuck her in

42
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,971
Keep the door open.

43
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,143
Why is Simu still awake?

44
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,644
Don't worry,
we won't be late for the pany.

45
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,052
And anyway...she's a kid,
not your car...

46
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,678
...that you can turn off with a key.

47
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,151
You've already staned?

48
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,224
Decide... whether you want
to party or fight?

49
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,256
Me?

50
00:06:58,919 --> 00:06:59,989
OK. Let's pany.

51
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,740
Nair, your family must be thrilled.

52
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,740
Yes, madam.

53
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,106
It's my daughter's
first visit to India.

54
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,305
Look ahead, Nair.

55
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,244
This isn't India.

56
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,112
Ranjit.
- What?

57
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,248
Fine, fine...take
your daughter along too.

58
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,045
She's only four years old...

59
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,279
No one will ask her
for any bribe either.

60
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,288
Take her to India.
She'll like it.

61
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,852
Be in a good mood.
- We'll see.

62
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,330
And please don't drink too much.
- We'll see.

63
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,167
Hey, guys.
- How are you, Ranjit?

64
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,066
Hello, how are you?
- Very good. Hi.

65
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,229
Hi, you're looking beautiful.
As usual.

66
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,365
Hi, how are you?

67
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,407
So nice to see you.

68
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,238
Ashok.

69
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:46,906
How are you?

70
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,968
Well...

71
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,013
Ranjit, where's Prem?
- Prem?

72
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,850
I invited him...
Hasn't he shown up yet?

73
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,943
You ruined him,
and then invited him.

74
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,212
Why would he come?

75
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,083
The Fawad deal was his, Ranjit.

76
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,189
You snatched it.

77
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,193
You should never mix
business and friendship

78
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,056
It's his problem
that he didn't show up.

79
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,766
Even witches spare friends.
- I am a demon.

80
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,031
How about some blood?
- No, Mr. Demon.

81
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,504
You drink it.
- Thank you.

82
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,744
My head's lost
in those Arabic eyes.

83
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:05,014
"Your lies have plundered me."

84
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,997
My head's lost
in those Arabic eyes.

85
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,437
"Your lies have plundered me."

86
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,071
My head's lost
in those Arabic eyes.

87
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,108
"Your lies have plundered me."

88
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,277
"It was lying inside my chest..."

89
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,377
"...in the season of |ove."

90
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,387
"A single gesture..."

91
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,447
"...and I gave my hean to you.

92
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,753
"Gave it..."

93
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,850
"Gave it..."

94
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,896
"Gave it..."

95
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,052
"Gave it..."

96
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,120
"Gave it..."

97
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,326
"Gave you my heart..."

98
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,390
"Gave it..."

99
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:21,893
"Magnificent...simply magnificent."

100
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,060
"You're just so addictive."

101
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,161
"Sweetheart, you're just too good."

102
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,437
"Amazing..."

103
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,600
"Your attitude's simply amazing."

104
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,867
"You're so stubborn."

105
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,137
"Sweetheart, you're just too good."

106
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,008
"Every time I looked at you.

107
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,176
"| never thought twice."

108
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,186
"A single gesture..."

109
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,222
"...and I gave my hean to you.

110
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,278
"Gave it..."

111
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,380
"Gave it..."

112
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,426
"Gave it..."

113
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:49,593
"Gave it..."

00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,954
"Gave it..."

00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,131
"Gave it..."

117
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,291
"Gave it..."

118
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,426
"Gave it..."

119
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,400
"Gave it..."

120
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,559
"Gave it..."

121
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,902
"Gave you my heart..."

122
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,031
"Gave it..."

123
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:57,712
Go! Go! Go fast!

124
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:03,256
You go to the right.

125
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,238
Hello.

126
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,353
Hold on.

127
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,050
‘Iraq and Kuwait had shared
a tense relationship for some time.‘

128
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,454
‘The tension was caused
by what always causes tension‘

129
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,129
'Money.'

130
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,297
‘Iraq owed Kuwait
14 billion dollars...‘

131
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,959
'...that Iraq wanted waived.‘

132
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,002
Okay, I'll call you later.

133
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,539
‘They were also demanding that
Kuwait produce less oil...‘

134
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,204
'...so that oil prices go up...‘

135
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,841
'...and Iraq profits more.‘

136
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,174
‘Amidst these apologies
and threats...‘

137
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,347
'...the Iraqis also
accused the Kuwaitis of...

138
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,247
'...stea|ing oil.‘

139
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,884
‘We had grown used
to these threats by now.‘

140
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,286
‘And believed that the
situation wouldn't change‘

141
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,219
‘But we were wrong.‘

142
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,418
‘It did.‘

143
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,190
‘And along with it, changed
the identities of us Kuwaitis.‘

144
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,262
Ranjit?

145
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,202
Ashok called.
- At 3am?

146
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:26,209
Apparently Saddam attacked Kuwait.
- Come on, Ranjit.

147
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,975
I am sure there must have been
some minor action at the border.

148
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,179
Ranjit...
- I've an idea.

149
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,847
Simran and you go to London.

150
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,088
Do you really think
there's some kind of threat?

151
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,144
I don't think so.

152
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,324
I'm sure schools will
be closed for few days.

153
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,925
You can come back in a week.

154
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,391
And every1hing will be fine.

155
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,023
Could Saddam have rea||y..
- Nothing has happened.

156
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,067
What is wrong with you?
- Nothing, ljust...

157
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,835
Do me a favour.
Go back to bed.

158
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,435
Go! ljust want to make some calls.

159
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,870
Go. Carry on. - Okay.

160
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:55,371
Go, go.

161
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,346
Kuwaitis! Come out!

162
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,587
This is our land now!

163
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,160
Hail Saddam!
- Get down.

164
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,493
Hail Saddam!

165
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,092
Hail Saddam!

166
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,931
Hail Saddam!

167
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,529
Hail Saddam!

168
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,338
Oh God! How bad is it?
- Very bad!

169
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,042
Just when I need them
most no one takes my calls.

170
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,550
Did you try Sheikh Faisal
at the Internal Ministry?

171
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,118
Don't tell me who to call.

172
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,748
Why are you shouting?
- I've already tried him, Amrita.

173
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,951
Relax, Ranjit.

174
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,160
The entire Kuwaiti Government is gone.

175
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,526
There's not a single official here.

176
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,060
We're practically without
a government, and you are...

177
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,794
Gone?
- Yes.

178
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,197
They ran away the
first chance they got.

179
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,872
Don't they have any responsibility
towards their own people?

180
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,134
Amrita...
- Mummy.

181
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,331
Why is Simu awake?

182
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,401
There's no school today.
Go. Go back to sleep.

183
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,970
Rita, please take her inside.

184
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,513
Go, baby. Go inside, please.

185
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,550
Nair, what's happening outside?

186
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,856
Sir, I avoided the main roads
and took the highway to get here.

187
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,213
The Iraqi army is everywhere.

188
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,257
They're checking everyone.

189
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,586
They're sparing everyone else...

190
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,489
...but seeking out
Kuwaitis and killing them.

191
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,059
Ranjit, why did you call him..?
- Amrita, mind your own business...

192
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,360
...and let me do mine.

193
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,025
Get the car, I'll go get ready.
- Okay sir.

194
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,400
Now you're going out tool?
- Just calm down.

195
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,570
What's wrong with you?

196
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:08,804
I'm going to the Embassy.

197
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,804
We'll get out of Kuwait
once even/thing's arranged.

198
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,101
Okay. Relax now.

199
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,326
Nair, don't be scared.

200
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,971
Stop the car!

201
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:47,943
Get out!

202
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,872
|ndian.. |ndian..
I'm indian.

203
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,383
Indian we are indian.

204
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,550
Don't talk with them
in arabic language.

205
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,183
Nair please sit in the car.

206
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,416
Nair!

207
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,763
Get in!

208
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,179
Play the music

209
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,683
What's that shining in your hand?
Give it to us.

210
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,944
Good, good!

211
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,040
Come on, move.

212
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,518
‘You must be really happy today‘.

213
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,887
Amitabh Bachchan...?

214
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,826
Deewar...?

215
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,726
Mr. Ranjit, yes or no?

216
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,237
If I hadn't passed through
that checkpoint today...

217
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,971
...then you wouldn't be still alive,
Mr. Ranjit.

218
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,241
Let me guess...

219
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,118
You didn't recognise me.

220
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,758
A year ago...you came to Baghdad...

221
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,033
...with your wife Amrita
and daughter Simran...

222
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,330
...for a Fundraiser.

223
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,366
And by the grace of Allah...
who was your security in-charge?

224
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,108
I was with you for two days...

225
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,611
...yet you don't recognise me.

226
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,179
I am kind of hum, Mr. Katiyal.

227
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,853
I remember...
- No! You don't!

228
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:55,588
Successful people...
should only remember imponant people.

229
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,363
And now...sudden|y...
I am someone important.

230
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:04,802
Mr. Khallaf Bin Zayed.
Iraqi Republican Army.

231
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,706
At your service.
- Thank you.

232
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,013
I'll give you plenty
of oppununities...

233
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,106
...to express your gratitude.

234
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,615
Like I gave him.

235
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,045
Fawad?

236
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,757
Fawad Al Sayyed.

237
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,915
Your business partner.

238
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,693
Al An Hazir Iraq, Mr. Katiyal.

239
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,194
Now this is Iraq.

240
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,424
And people like you...

241
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,133
...wi|| help us keep it that way.

242
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,969
I'm taking another step towards that.

243
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,236
A small gift.

244
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,635
This sticker.

245
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,714
Put it on the windshield of your car.

246
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,384
It'll be helpful at checkpoints.

247
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,187
Otherwise...we could
be meeting every day.

248
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,088
We're friends now, Mr. Ranjit.

249
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,422
If you ever need any1hing...

250
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,893
...don't hesitate .

251
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,093
In return...|'m sure
you too honor this friendship.

252
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,034
You can go.

253
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,456
Mr.Saini.

254
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,355
Mr. Katiyal, over here.

255
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,992
Thank God you saw me.

256
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,256
It's okay.

257
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,831
an]!

258
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,234
Brij! What the hell is happening?

259
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,905
What happened? Calm down.

260
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,876
A 16 year old Iraqi
soldier shot my driver.

261
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,012
They dragged me to the Dasman palace.

262
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,206
I couldn't tell if...

263
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,840
...that Iraqi Major
was being friendly...

264
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:53,940
...or threatening me.

265
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:54,984
And you're asking what happened?

266
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,348
Come, sit.

267
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,217
Have some water.

268
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,922
We'll son it out, don't worry.

269
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,163
I am sorry.
- No, it's okay.

270
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,702
What is the airport situation?

271
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,843
The Iraqis have control over it.

272
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,575
No one can come in.

273
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:27,982
And there's no question of leaving.

274
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,711
And the Indian Government?

275
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,183
As usual, must be watching the show.

276
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,421
Your Kuwaiti government...

277
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,548
...didn't even wait
for the show to start.

278
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,783
They fled.

279
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,517
Policy decisions
are not made in hours.

280
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,060
And the entire world's
watching the show.

281
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,560
Brij, do something.

282
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,431
Get me and my family out of here.

283
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:48,494
We have to get out.

284
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,905
Yes. And so do another
170,000 Indians.

285
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,007
But how will you?

286
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,549
Okay...do one thing.

287
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,617
Bring your family here.

288
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,022
Take her.

289
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,191
Look! What a fancy house!

290
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,025
Look, a Kuwaiti Teddy!

291
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,096
Dead Kuwaiti Teddy!

292
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,872
What are you doing?

293
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,149
Give me your ID.

294
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,986
Okay, you can go.

295
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,597
Amrita!

296
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,065
Amrita!

297
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,900
Simu!

298
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,566
Amrita!

299
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,076
Amrita!

300
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,174
Amrita!

301
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,842
Simu!

302
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,546
Simu!

303
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:27,684
Amrita!

304
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:40,893
Simu!

305
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,908
Joseph, did anyone call from home?

306
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:54,808
Ranjit.

307
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,981
Do you know how scared I was?
- Papa!

308
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,078
You have no idea howl
brought Simu in here.

309
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,185
Where were you?

310
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,693
Ranjit, please. Let's just leave.

311
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,563
You were saying that
we should go to London.

312
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,760
Let's go to London.

313
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,530
Just get us out of here.
- Nair's been shot.

314
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,665
Are you even listening?
- Amrita, Nair's been shot.

315
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,542
Nair?

316
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,141
So were you at the hospital?

317
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,571
How is he now?

318
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:39,647
Ranjit.

319
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,617
Ranjit.
- He's dead.

320
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,623
What?
- Yeah...

321
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,188
They killed him...
right in front of my eyes.

322
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,133
Little kids are walking
around with guns.

323
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,866
Fawad Al Sayyed was
hanging off a crane.

324
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,805
Oh my...
- So what is Ranjit Katiyal wonh?

325
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,477
I couldn't even ask
about Nair's body.

326
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,610
His wife just called.

327
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:27,702
Mother.

328
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,366
Mr. Ranjit, why are you standing?

329
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,105
Please sit.
- Thank you.

330
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,371
Not here.

331
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,271
Here.

332
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,988
There's a price to every1hing,
Mr. Ranjit.

333
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,761
I am ready to pay.

334
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:38,862
The Kuwaiti Dinar is worthless now.

335
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:43,730
300,000 dollars for 3 people.

336
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,240
We are five.
- Five?

337
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,340
My driver's wife and his child.

338
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,740
Driver's wife...

339
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,990
This is your chance to
get out with your family.

340
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,720
Don't get involved in social work...

341
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,522
...you'|| only get stuck funher.

342
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,231
I'm not the type who gets stuck.

343
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,459
Anyway...| can arrange for your money.

344
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,267
Very good!

345
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,073
Thank you.

346
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,472
Joseph.

347
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,344
How much do we have?
- Earlier, there were 200.

348
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,438
And now..
- I'm talking about cash.

349
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,508
Sir, thank God you've come.

350
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,410
It now feels like
things will get better.

351
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,749
We're scared.

352
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,186
Please tell us what to do.

353
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,790
Sir...

354
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,010
Joseph, make a list of our
staff and their families.

355
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,186
See if we can accommodate
everyone here.

356
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,845
Otherwise,
we'll make other arrangements.

357
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,213
Relax everyone.

358
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,325
Sit.

359
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,994
Relax.

360
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,832
What do you think you're doing?

361
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,869
Why aren't you getting us out of here?

362
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,728
I can't just desen them, can l?

363
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,341
But you can desen us.

364
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,906
Don't you have any
responsibility towards us?

365
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,135
Of course I do.

366
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,210
But these people work for me.

367
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,278
They have the same
expectations from us...

368
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,341
...as we did
the Kuwaiti government.

369
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,416
How can anyone run from
their responsibilities...

370
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,154
...these were your words.
- Yes, they were.

371
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,159
But it's easy to make tall claims.

372
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,389
That was my mistake.

373
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,323
But you're making an even bigger one.

374
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,924
And why this sudden
urge to be a Messiah?

375
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,970
I have no interest in being a Messiah.

376
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,101
I too want to get us out of here.

377
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,239
But... once I make
some arrangements for them.

378
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,292
Take care of yourselves.

379
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,224
Soon we'll make some arrangements.

380
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,862
Did you eat?

381
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,131
Did you eat?

382
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,374
Give me some space.

383
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,143
Where do you expect me to sleep?

384
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,614
Strange problem.

385
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:46,582
Calm down.

386
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,484
Isn't there enough of
a battle for space outside?

387
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:50,925
Stop being childish.

388
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,393
Come here.
Here.

389
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,427
Come on.

390
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:57,299
There's space here.

391
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,190
Excuse me.

392
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,689
The toilets have become very dirty.

393
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,627
They're stinking.

394
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,192
You're the <i>boss,</i> aren't you?

395
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,323
That's why I am telling you.

396
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,167
Do you work here?
- No!

397
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,261
Hey come here.

398
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,406
Let me know when it's clean.

399
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,332
I'm in this room.

400
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,700
Hey, move aside.

401
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,645
I'm not going to be called a refugee
along with these drivers and coolies...

402
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,704
- Sir, any problem?

403
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,215
Who is he?
- I don't know, sir.

404
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,209
Around 100 more came here last night.

405
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,820
There are many like him.

406
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,457
More than 1000 Indians
are waiting outside.

407
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,024
How did they get here?

408
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,688
Sir, they say they're friends,
relatives, etcetera...

409
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,163
...of our employees.

410
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,164
They had nowhere to go.

411
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,665
So they came here...

412
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,360
...because they feel
safer when they're together.

413
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,397
Sir...it's hard to arrange
food for 500 people.

414
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,902
What will we do with 1600?

415
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,436
If you want, I can identify
those who work for us...

416
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,478
..and ask the rest to leave?

417
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,248
No!

418
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:11,128
Hello, sir.

419
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:13,301
This way.

420
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,970
Wasn't Ranjit heading here?

421
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,669
But I heard the situation
is pretty bad in the city centre.

422
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,046
Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

423
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,582
Hey, Ranjit.
- He's here.

424
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,614
How are you?

425
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,984
Thank you.

426
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,119
Ranjit, you too?
In the day?

427
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,815
Saddam has turned
every1hing on its head.

428
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,755
Ranjit, when all
this is over tomorrow...

429
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:43,194
...you'|| have an exciting
story to tell your grandchildren.

430
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,665
Like "When uncle Saddam
was swirling Kuwait around..."

431
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:50,304
...| was siwrling a glass of
scotch in Kurien uncle's supermarket.

432
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,931
So it'll all be over tomorrow?
- Of course, Ranjit.

433
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,405
You think America will stay quiet?

434
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,109
So what is America waiting for?

435
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,010
For us to finish our scotch.

436
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,614
Calm down, Ranjit.

437
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,283
They'll keep us afraid of
the villain for a couple of days.

438
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,979
Then tell the Arabs,
‘look at what happened to Kuwait.‘

439
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:06,244
‘Let us in...bui|d a military base.‘

440
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,288
‘And we'll keep you safe.‘

441
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,154
And every1hing will
be back to business.

442
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,318
It's a question of a few days.

443
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,925
So gentlemen, this is every1hing.

444
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,726
You guys can take what you want.

445
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,424
Ranjit.

446
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,133
Ibrahim.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,170
Ranjit sir...|'m sure
you haven't brought a truck.

448
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,933
So Ibrahim will load up...

449
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,735
...and deliver it to your office.

450
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,341
Tell me something...

451
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,212
Why are we dividing all the food?

452
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,784
Why don't we all
gather at one place...

453
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,853
...and take all the stuff there.

454
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,950
You know,
if we Indians stay together...

455
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,393
What happened?
- We Indians?

456
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:45,250
Oh, come on!

457
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,193
Since when did you
become an Indian, Ranjit?

458
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:48,788
Weren't you always a Kuwaiti.

459
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,667
Ranjit, let's just take the
first flight out of here.

460
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,228
Saddam has attacked them.

461
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,396
Why should we be bothered?

462
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,996
What's the bother?

463
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,807
All we need is a big space,
that's all.

464
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,209
It's a question of
couple of days, Ranjit.

465
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,838
What's the problem?
- Hold on.

466
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:09,342
Ranjit is right.
- Let's solve our own problems.

467
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,751
Trying to help 170,000..

468
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,215
...wi|| only add to our problems.

469
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,021
Come on, Ibrahim.

470
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,052
Ashok...

471
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,866
...outside of this supermarket...

472
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,195
nobody recognizes you or me.

473
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,396
We have no standing.

474
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,375
The only thing we
have is our identity.

475
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,444
We're Indian, not Kuwaiti.

476
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,810
Together we're something...

477
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:41,740
If not...

478
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:43,852
Nothing!

479
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:55,929
It's old whiskey... but not
wonh 500,000 dollars, Mr. Ranjit.

480
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,365
I did try to tell you...

481
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,373
Getting involved
in social work is a trap.

482
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,842
That's not it, sir.

483
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,100
Once the camp is set up...

484
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,238
...|'|| leave with my wife and child.

485
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,339
As long as you're with us.

486
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:17,181
Aah...you're trying to flatter me.

487
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,823
Even the President considers
Indians as friends.

488
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,057
You can setup camp anywhere you want.

489
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,356
You have my permission.
- Thank you.

490
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:31,760
But why take your family to the camp?

491
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,799
Tell your wife it's safe at home.

492
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,038
You have my word.

493
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,230
Thank you.

494
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,006
Come on.

495
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,274
Excuse me.

496
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:55,907
There are classrooms at the back.

497
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:56,917
You can sleep there.

498
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,815
There are bathrooms here too.

499
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,589
There's water available
here.

500
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,784
And Ashok's trying to find out.

501
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:07,788
You see...we can put up tents here...

502
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,957
...and let people sleep.

503
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,861
Ranjit.
- Yes, Ashok.

504
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,199
The canteen's on that side.
We can serve them meals in there.

505
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:17,228
Simu.

506
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:19,197
Simu!

507
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,174
Simu!

508
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:24,236
Simu!

509
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:25,870
Simu!

510
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,875
Simu!

511
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:29,983
Simu!

512
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:31,751
Mom.

513
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,250
Simu, out of the bus!

514
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,260
I told you to stay right here!

515
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,625
Come on.

516
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:41,192
Come here.

517
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,691
You can stay here.

518
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:49,434
This is my luggage-

519
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,765
What do you mean by that?

520
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:57,806
This is my room.
- No, we'll shift to some other room.

521
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:02,443
It should be first come, first served.

522
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,180
I saw it first.

523
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:05,414
What do you think this is...

524
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,051
‘finders keepers‘?

525
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:09,689
We'll go..
- No, no, not at all.

526
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,785
If she's okay...

527
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,431
Nonsense!

528
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:22,860
Come here.

529
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:31,811
Come on, let's go.
- No!

530
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,871
We won't stay here.

531
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:36,419
We'll all be together here.
It'll be safe.

532
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,282
Safe!

533
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,949
I found Simu playing with this!
A bullet!

534
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:43,790
You can help them settle down,
if you want.

535
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:45,155
Don't involve us.

536
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,322
Amrita...
- No.

537
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,163
When you're ready,
pick us up from home.

538
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:52,928
The Major has guaranteed
our safety, hasn't he?

539
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,264
I'm leaving.

540
00:44:58,896 --> 00:44:59,897
Are you coming?

541
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:04,811
Okay, sit.

542
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,949
I'll drop her home.
- Okay.

543
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,182
Take care of things.

544
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:27,962
What are you doing?

545
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,935
Get lost.

546
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,804
Get lost.

547
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,036
ls this a picnic?

548
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:38,472
There's a war going on...

549
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:40,080
Do you have any sense?

550
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,045
No discipline at all.

551
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,310
Look at him screaming.

552
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,352
Who's that?

553
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,346
It can be only one guy?
- Who?

554
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:47,755
My husband.

555
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,362
Let me take him...

556
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,798
While you eat something.

557
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:06,501
I'll take it... We'll eat later.

558
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,353
Ashok, we've finished our scotch...

559
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,894
Where is America?

560
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,861
Forget America...Where's India?

561
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,356
Around 150,000 Indians are stuck here.

562
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:31,729
ls anyone concerned?

563
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,462
They haven't done anything for us.

564
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,231
It's not like we've done anything
for India either.

565
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:38,374
You might
not have done any1hing.

566
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,534
We send millions of Dinar to India.

567
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,271
They want our Dinar...

568
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,882
...but they don't
care about our lives.

569
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:50,118
If this had
been a western country...

570
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,481
...their embassy would've
gotten their people out by now.

571
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,346
The embassy can do something...

572
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,255
...on|y if they know
that we've setup a camp.

573
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,385
How will they find out? When we..
- What's this?

574
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,786
There's no discipline in the camp.

575
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,031
What?

576
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:07,993
Didn't you hear?

577
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,298
I heard.

578
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,767
Good.

579
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,815
Let's go to the embassy.

580
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,657
Kurien, look there.
- Yes.

581
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,904
Where's everyone?
- Gone.

582
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:45,869
Gone?

583
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,203
Where's Brij?

584
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,104
The entire embassy has been evacuated.

585
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,335
I'm leaving too.

586
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:53,179
Saddam says there's no point in
having two embassies in one country.

587
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,748
All the embassies
are in Baghdad anyway.

588
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:57,684
So will all the Indians
go to Baghdad now?

589
00:47:57,742 --> 00:47:59,415
No point yelling at me.

590
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:01,155
Talk to the External
Affairs Ministry in Delhi.

591
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,416
They'll tell you
what Indians should do.

592
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,687
What nonsense.
- Wait. Wait.

593
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:05,953
Do you have any number?

594
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,087
Someone we can call?

595
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:18,235
Mr. Mishra, come.

596
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:19,997
Come on.

597
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:52,866
Hello, Ministry of External Affairs.

598
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:56,204
This is Ranjit Katiyal
speaking from Kuwait city.

599
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,107
Yes.

600
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,079
We've been given a few numbers...

601
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,009
By the way, who is this?

602
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,014
Joint Secretary, Sanjeev Kohli.

603
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:06,021
I wanted to talk to you about...

604
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:08,216
...the situation of
Indians living in Kuwait.

605
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,320
We Indians have setup
camp in Apex School...

606
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,358
Look,
I don't handle the Gulf Division.

607
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,824
You've been given the wrong number.

608
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,060
Look Mr. Kohli, we need help.

609
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:21,294
And we need it right now.

610
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:22,969
Well...

611
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,609
I'll communicate this...

612
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:30,678
...to the Joint
Secretary of the Gulf division.

613
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:32,646
Give me the number to your school.

614
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,351
Green chilly?

615
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:42,353
No, thanks.

616
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:43,819
Meher! Meher!

617
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,260
This is where we're going to live?

618
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:49,825
With these people?

619
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,792
I'm leaving!
- Dad!

620
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,068
They are killing people outside.

621
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,066
Meher, Saddam has guaranteed...

622
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:58,403
...that Iraqis won'thur1|ndians.

623
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,403
How would they know...

624
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,938
...who's Kuwaiti, who's Indian?

625
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,000
Meher...The bank has
my entire life's savings...

626
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,137
...not yours!

627
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:07,974
I'm leaving!

628
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:16,017
It's okay, dear.

629
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,386
It'll be okay.

630
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,359
Let me do it.

631
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,093
Can I tie that for you.

632
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:26,260
Allow me...

633
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:27,634
What?

634
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:29,937
What did you say?

635
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,439
Are you Kuwaiti?

636
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:41,549
You go ahead.

637
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:46,152
Sheer insensitivity.

638
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:49,716
There's no communication from
the External Ministry yet.

639
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,156
While taking our number...
- Papa!

640
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,989
My sweetie-pie.

641
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:55,892
Hello, stranger.

642
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,126
This is the first nice
surprise after 2nd August.

643
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,169
You hardly ever come home.

644
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,697
So I have to bring Simu
here to see her father, don't l?

645
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:06,764
Thank you.

646
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,602
What's going on?

647
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,171
Nothing much. We've been trying to
reach the External Affairs Ministry...

648
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,944
...in Delhi for four days,
but haven't managed to.

649
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:16,148
Hello, ma'am.

650
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,048
How are you?
- Fine.

651
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:17,744
Yes.

652
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:18,718
Come, Simu.

653
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:20,722
I'll show you something really nice.

654
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:23,990
Are you enjoying all this?
- What?

655
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:27,621
I have no idea when you come or go.

656
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,690
I'm trying to son all this.

657
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,834
Our peop|e..
- Our people?

658
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:35,000
Our people?

659
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,973
Calling Delhi every day,
playing Indian Indian...

660
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,037
Since when did you
stan caring so much about them?

661
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,574
Whenever I spoke about
going to India... - Amrita.

662
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:46,614
Amrita, once we have
some clarity from De|hi..

663
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,378
..about the status of our people
we'll get out of here.

664
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,915
Hello, ma'am.
- Yeah.

665
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,886
Will you answer one question?

666
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,792
And I'm not asking in anger.

667
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,593
Why? Why all this?

668
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:01,794
Why this charade?

669
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:05,800
And what are you
suddenly trying to be?

670
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,597
Ranjit?

671
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,673
Look at these people.
- Why?

672
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,203
Amrita, look at them.

673
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,882
Some of them have been
working in our office...

674
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,849
...for 5...10...12 years.

675
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,878
But I didn't even know their names.

676
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:29,618
Unfortunately, now I do.

677
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,259
If we walk away...

678
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,356
...we will be leaving these
names behind, not just any crowd.

679
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,795
It's true, they're not related to us.

680
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,700
But neither was Nair.

681
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:45,799
And he lost his life.

682
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,303
And it's not like I'm giving up
my life for these people.

683
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:54,016
If I turn away now, won't you ask...

684
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:56,782
"Ranjit, what kind of a man are you?"

685
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:00,981
Ranjit!

686
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,863
Sir, we're Indians.

687
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,760
We have permission.

688
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,296
We have permission.

689
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:50,463
Ismail, Mani. Go hide the food.
- Okay.

690
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,628
Good to see you, Mr. Ranjit.

691
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:56,624
Where's my whiskey today?

692
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:00,726
Your soldiers came...

693
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,270
They looted our camp.

694
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:03,798
I am sorry.

695
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,804
But what can they do?

696
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,809
Baghdad sent us...

697
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:10,069
...but forgot our supplies.

698
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:13,605
They thought we could depend
on your hospitality.

699
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:16,249
But... why are you so worried?

700
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,847
It's not like they
really did anything to you.

701
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:19,885
Did they?

702
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,183
Maybe they will come back.

703
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,349
I can't stop them.

704
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,581
How do I ensure the
safety of my people?

705
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,228
Ranjit! Ranjit! Ranjit!

706
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:32,293
Now I know for sure you're trapped.

707
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,760
You can all leave Kuwait
anytime if you want.

708
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:39,300
The President, like me, is
a friend of Indians.

709
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,008
And he has already
permitted Indians to leave.

710
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:46,310
You never told me that.
- You never asked.

711
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:48,049
And that's why you never told me?

712
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,844
May Allah be with you.

713
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,258
But Ranjit...te|| me..

714
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,189
Where will you go
with all these people?

715
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:09,435
Yes, sir?
- Joseph. My medicines are almost over.

716
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,964
I'll look into it, sir.

717
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:14,071
What if the soldiers come back?

718
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:15,201
There's nothing we can do, sir.

719
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,938
Joseph.
- Yes, sir.

720
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:18,068
Excuse me.

721
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,214
Make a list...

722
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:21,338
...of the people here.

723
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:22,683
Write down all their names.

724
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,275
We should know how
many people are here.

725
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:25,913
And what are we doing about food now?

726
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,785
Sir, we still have food for 2-3 days.

727
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,723
Ibrahim managed
to hide half the food.

728
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,727
Thank God.
Well, that's good.

729
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,526
But why are you calling me?

730
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,166
I already passed on
the number to the Gulf Desk.

731
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:41,997
Sir, no one has called
from the Ministry yet.

732
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,231
And they probably never will.

733
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,362
I need your help.
- What?

734
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:48,141
Look, Saddam Hussain has permitted...

735
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,269
...us Indians to get out of Kuwait.

736
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,742
But we don't know where to go...

737
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:53,975
...when or how?

738
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,779
If you could help us,
then it'll be really great.

739
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,946
Let me speak to the
Minister and call you back.

740
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:03,382
0K8‘!-

741
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:04,691
Yes, Kohli.

742
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,886
Those Indians stuck in Kuwait...

743
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,157
Talk to Sharma at the Gulf Desk.

744
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:11,129
Sir, if you could just
put in a word.

745
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:13,691
Kohli! The Prime
Minister's waiting for me.

746
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:14,832
Hurry HP!

747
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,703
Father's name, Vasudevan.

748
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:20,073
Trichur.

749
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:21,369
Okay, please.

750
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:22,936
Next.

751
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,283
We must tell sir now.

752
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,386
Ibrahim, have you lost your mind?

753
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:43,056
You shouldn't have
hidden this from me!

754
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:46,324
If those Iraqi soldiers
had found out...

755
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,763
...that she's a Kuwaiti.

756
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,233
They would've shot
everyone in the camp.

757
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:56,440
Sir, I didn't think about that.

758
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,976
I only thought about what
they would've done to her.

759
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,417
But honestly, sir...

760
00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:11,157
...what is the proof
that we're not Kuwaiti.

761
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,325
Most of them don't have any documents.

762
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,756
Agents have their passpons.

763
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:18,959
Who will believe we're Indian?

764
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,174
Mr. Ranjit Katiyal.

765
00:59:30,434 --> 00:59:33,108
Look, I couldn't find out much.

766
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,446
But I was informed
by the Gulf Division that...

767
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,452
...you could possibly go to Jordan.

768
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,115
Possibly?

769
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:45,385
But Mr. Kohli,
many of us don't have passpons.

770
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:49,020
What do we do?
- I don't know about that.

771
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:50,458
But...

772
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:53,765
Do you have any contacts in Baghdad?

773
00:59:54,525 --> 00:59:55,731
Are you crazy?

774
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,998
He'll go to Iraq?

775
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,135
Do you think it's a picnic?

776
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,936
Those boy soldiers,
who haven't even reached pubeny...

777
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:03,943
Crazy!

778
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,272
Ashok, what choice do we have?

779
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,080
You said that so easily
but what choice do we have?

780
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:12,379
Those crazy Iraqis
can come back anytime.

781
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,921
They can blow up
our school.

782
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,012
And what can we do?

783
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,382
Isn't it better that I go to Baghdad?

784
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,018
Talk to some people.
I know some people.

785
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,560
We must do something.

786
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,023
We can't just sit here
with our hands tied.

787
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,769
Sir, there's a hospital up ahead.

788
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,573
Can we stop there for a minute...

789
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:36,935
If you don't mind...

790
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:38,776
Thank you.

791
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:21,547
Sorry for the trouble, sir.

792
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,223
Come on, let's get out of here.

793
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:06,931
Paper.

794
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:07,967
Paper.

795
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,236
Indian. Indian.

796
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,235
Sticker!

797
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:18,810
How did he get this?

798
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:20,404
Okay, let him go!

799
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,239
Open the way!

800
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,980
- Go! Go!
- Thank you!

801
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,236
ls someone at the hospital?

802
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:45,430
I got married 8 days ago.

803
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,473
My bride's name is Shazin.

804
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:50,937
The ceremony was
to be two days later...

805
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:52,547
...a|ong with the send-off.

806
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:56,313
ButmSaddam sent
his cavalry that night.

807
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:01,047
Shazin is a nurse at the hospital.

808
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,549
And she's been busy
at the hospital since then?

809
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:04,985
No, sir. She's not at the hospital...

810
01:03:05,048 --> 01:03:07,187
...nor was she at home.

811
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:09,486
I've been looking for her...

812
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,423
...but I haven't
found any trace of her.

813
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:28,646
Don't go, Ranjit. It's not safe.

814
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,951
Why don't you understand
me these days?

815
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:37,157
Neither of us understands the other.

816
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:41,257
It's the circumstances
that are wrong... Not us.

817
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:46,963
"| am going to love you so much."

818
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:52,970
I'm going to love
you 100 times in a moment.

819
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:59,642
"|f you ever live me."

820
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:04,943
"| will only wait for death."

821
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,317
"|'ve forsaken the world for you."

822
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,591
"My breath stops on you."

823
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,161
"| love you so much."

824
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:17,599
"You can never imagine."

825
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,700
"|'ve forsaken the world for you."

826
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,701
"My breath stops on you."

827
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,400
"| love you so much."

828
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:30,676
"You can never imagine."

829
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:37,774
Sir, we've
setup camp in a school...

830
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:39,147
You haven't tried it yet.

831
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:40,643
Have some...

832
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,383
It's called Kleicha.

833
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,984
It's considered Iraq's
national biscuit.

834
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:47,927
I am talking about my problem.

835
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,191
I've heard a lot
about this boy lately.

836
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,963
But he made only 10
runs in the first innings...

837
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,762
...and then 27 in the second.

838
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:56,929
I think the selectors
don't have a clue.

839
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,504
I meanmthey put anyone
in the Indian team.

840
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,042
Look, I'm not here
for your biscuits...

841
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:03,941
...nor to discuss anyone's future...

842
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,071
...on the Indian cricket team.

843
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:09,941
We're all trapped in a
war-zone in a foreign country.

844
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:13,419
And you are... - I am trying
to change the subject, Mr. Katiyal...

845
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,113
...because I know what you're facing.

846
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,783
I have no interest in hassling you.

847
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:21,892
How would we know if...

848
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:25,125
...everyone in your camp is Indian.

849
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,724
What if they turn out to
be Pakistani or Bangladeshi?

850
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,094
We can't issue them passpons, can we?

851
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,804
I get it.

852
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:40,547
Thank you.

853
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:42,110
Sorry, Mr. Katiyal.

854
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,541
All I can offer you is this Kleicha.

855
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:47,148
Please take one.

856
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,015
At least take one.

857
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:56,496
Sir, anything?

858
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:00,534
Iraqi biscuit. Kleicha.

859
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:18,715
It doesn't feel like these
are the guys who just attacked Kuwait.

860
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:27,855
Thank you.

861
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:29,758
What now, sir?

862
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,929
Do we even matter to Delhi?

863
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:33,863
We matter to ourselves.

864
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,528
We'll have to keep trying, what else?

865
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,229
We can't blame Delhi either.

866
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:40,731
There are many here...

867
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:42,572
...who didn't care
about Delhi until now.

868
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,639
They thought they were Kuwaiti.

869
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,246
That's human nature, Ibrahim.

870
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,280
When you're hum,
you first call out to your mother.

871
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,554
I'll go call Kurien.

872
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:00,660
Yes, Kurien.

873
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:03,992
Nothing. Kuwaitis were of no help.

874
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,225
Just as the Indians weren't.

875
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:06,999
That leaves us with just one option.

876
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,295
I know some Iraqis.

877
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,502
I'll try asking them for help...

878
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,564
...to meet Saddam's
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.

879
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,039
Mr. Katiyal.

880
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:19,238
Hello.
- Hello.

881
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,176
Please.
- Thank you.

882
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:27,147
Would you like some tea?
- No. Thank you.

883
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,057
Have some.
- Thank you.

884
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:39,166
Mr. Katiyal,
this is what I can do for you.

885
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,332
There's a ship called Tipu Sultan...

886
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:43,933
...coming from India.

887
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:47,734
With 10,000 tons of food
and medical supplies for Iraq.

888
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:50,742
Indians have been good...

889
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,207
...when the whole
world was against us.

890
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,978
I can allow the Indians in Kuwait...

891
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,077
...to go on their ship back home.

892
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:00,852
Thank you.

893
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:02,856
Thank you, Mr. Aziz.

894
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,550
I really appreciate.
Thank you.

895
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,931
The Night's over...and
the morning has arrived.

896
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,296
"Happiness has crossed all limits."

897
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,798
The Night's over...and
the morning has arrived.

898
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:53,033
"Happiness has crossed all limits."

899
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:55,608
"My hean leaps and jumps..."

900
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:57,712
"...with the beat of the drums."

901
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,644
"Today I want to..."

902
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,542
"Today I want to dance."

903
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,812
"Today I want to dance."

904
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,218
"Today I want to dance."

905
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:10,121
"Today I want to dance."

906
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:16,291
Show me that step. Show it.

907
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:17,956
Hello, Mr. Ranjit.

908
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,661
How many people can get on that ship?

909
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,062
I don't know.

910
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,795
Women and children first.

911
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:27,673
And then the old men, I know.

912
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:28,638
Hold on.

913
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,145
Did you take it in
writing from Tariq Aziz?

914
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,040
What? Ranjit?

915
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,843
You simply took his word for it?

916
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,889
You must do things properly.

917
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,387
Paperwork is highly important.

918
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,692
I don't know how you handled
such a huge company.

919
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,043
That's good news, Mr. Katiyal.

920
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:08,915
See you soon.

921
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:11,277
Papa, what else will we see in India?

922
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:14,748
Well there's...there's...

923
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,657
You don't remember?
- No, sweetheart. Of course I do.

924
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:22,663
But if I tell you now,
it'll ruin your surprise.

925
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:27,761
"EVeFY heaIfs high on joy."

926
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:31,666
"Life Will be filled With bliss."

927
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:35,069
I'm going to lift my
feet and dance all night.

928
01:10:35,165 --> 01:10:37,668
No one's going to
feel tired and sit down.

929
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,247
We're going to shake the
earth with the thump of our feet.

930
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,845
"Its time for friends to rejoice."

931
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,854
"All thanks t0 God."

932
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,616
"Today I want to..."

933
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:51,716
"Today I want to dance."

934
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,886
"Today I want to dance."

935
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,326
"Today I want to dance."

936
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,657
"Today I want to dance."

937
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:15,445
Hello.
- Mr. Katiyal.

938
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:17,944
Yes, Mr. Kohli.
We were just leaving.

939
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:21,919
There's bad news, Mr. Katiyal.

940
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,017
UN has enforced an embargo on Iraq.

941
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,954
Which means...nothing
can enter or leave Iraq.

942
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:30,861
And...

943
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:34,835
Tipu Sultan has been stopped.

944
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,898
Unfortunately, it won't reach you.

945
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:47,938
It's being turned away to Dubai.

946
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:49,706
I'm so sorry.

947
01:12:09,259 --> 01:12:11,796
The United Nations
has proposed the imposition...

948
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:14,670
...of numerous sanctions
on Iraq for attacking Kuwait.

949
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,066
The UN has refused credibility...

950
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:21,081
...to the newly formed Kuwait
government after the attack.

951
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:26,109
They refuted Iraq's claim...

952
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:28,220
Where are you going?

953
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,116
Where would I go...

954
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:36,197
...in this pigeon coop.

955
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:40,734
We used to have a
mansion back in Lahore.

956
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,198
We used to play football...

957
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:45,034
...and cricket in there!

958
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:46,902
For years you've been telling
me about a place...

959
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:49,735
...where I'm never
going to be able to go.

960
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:51,874
Laugh all you want, son.

961
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:58,179
The Indians trapped in
Kuwait are faced with a dilemma.

962
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:03,013
Those who are forced to
leave their homes in a jiffy...

963
01:13:06,282 --> 01:13:07,659
...they don't laugh.

964
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:14,524
Sir... Food is going to be a problem.

965
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,261
What do I do?

966
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:16,998
Farm the desert?

967
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:18,970
Why do you come to me?

968
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,234
Solve your own problems.

969
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,332
Saddam hasn't made me the Emir.

970
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,169
Ranjit, what are you saying?
- What else can I do?

971
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,907
Give them hope, and then shatter
it again? And again!

972
01:13:27,103 --> 01:13:28,605
It's not your fault.

973
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:30,309
And we can't even to talk
to those who are at fault.

974
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:31,644
Stay here!

975
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:34,751
We're not going inside!

976
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,823
Let's just go.

977
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:39,051
You can go. I need to talk.

978
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,889
Talk! Talk about what?

979
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,122
I don't talk to Sidekicks!

980
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:44,597
Whom did you call a sidekick?

981
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:46,834
Who do you think you are?

982
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:49,028
You've been a trouble-maker
since you got here!

983
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:51,865
He didn't have anything in writing.

984
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:55,940
He made us pack our bags.

985
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,300
Sit in buses...

986
01:13:57,367 --> 01:13:58,710
...and then asked us to get off.

987
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:00,178
ls this a joke?

988
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,613
He was harping about Baghdad.

989
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:04,779
Where's Baghdad now?

990
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,314
Forget it. Let's go.

991
01:14:07,377 --> 01:14:09,186
I won't, you go.

992
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:14,954
You like being a leader, don't you?

993
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:16,863
<i>A leader has answers.</i>

994
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:17,863
Do you have any?

995
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,526
You're a big man...

996
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:26,771
...how would you know
what it feels like...

997
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,738
...to have hopes shattered.

998
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:31,000
Why are you standing
there quietly now?

999
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:34,213
Because he's a big man.

1000
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:36,110
If he was petty like you...

1001
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:38,243
...he'd be talking
as much as you, or more.

1002
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:41,653
What do you mean to us?

1003
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,291
He cou|d've left with
Simu and me days ago.

1004
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:51,188
He still can. But he isn't.

1005
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:54,360
Instead of staying with his family...

1006
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:57,796
...he worries about you all the time.

1007
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,196
And at a time like this...

1008
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:02,675
...he left us and went to Baghdad.

1009
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:06,313
You'd be scared to even
go to the end of the street.

1010
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:10,146
It's easy to point out mistakes,
Mr. George.

1011
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,715
But it takes a lot to
have the courage to make mistakes.

1012
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,182
And he has that courage.

1013
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:20,924
You don't. - So who asked him...
to take on our responsibility?

1014
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:22,256
No one did.

1015
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,026
You're right.

1016
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,128
I even warned him against it.

1017
01:15:26,656 --> 01:15:27,930
But what could I do?

1018
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:30,594
Suddenly he developed a conscience...

1019
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,867
...and realized he
shouldn't be selfish.

1020
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:35,801
He should help others.

1021
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:39,206
Some people have a kind of a...
manufacturing defect.

1022
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:41,205
They change during tough times.

1023
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:42,979
He changed too.

1024
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:45,643
You stand here...

1025
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,346
...b|aming him for every1hing.

1026
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:50,854
But you don't rea|ise...Mr. George...

1027
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:54,760
...you're only standing
here because of him.

1028
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,726
Because he setup this camp.

1029
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:00,626
Unfortunately, you'll never meet...

1030
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:03,431
...the man that Ranjit Katiyal
was 10 days ago.

1031
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:05,436
Otherwisemhe was an expen...

1032
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:07,197
...in showing a man his place.

1033
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,740
You talk about feelings?

1034
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,009
I saw his face when he was told...

1035
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,672
...that Tipu Sultan
had been turned back.

1036
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:19,011
You feel bad for your family...

1037
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,215
Imagine the plight of the man...

1038
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:26,418
...who was hoping to send
thousands of families back home?

1039
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,267
Any more problems?
Should I go on?

1040
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,362
Please, take him inside.

1041
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:49,282
What?

1042
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:57,784
I've already told him...

1043
01:16:57,847 --> 01:16:59,690
...Mr. Kohli is back
with the Kuwait issue.

1044
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:03,663
The Minister hasn't
been answering the phone since.

1045
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:06,028
It looks like he won't go home today.

1046
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,998
I just need to talk to him.

1047
01:17:09,892 --> 01:17:13,396
I don't get it.
You're not even in the Gulf Division.

1048
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:18,612
Everyone else is preparing
to leave for the Malaysia conference.

1049
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,938
And you're sitting here.

1050
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,318
Lata, those people are in trouble.

1051
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:26,820
There's a guy who calls me everyday.

1052
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,614
What do I say to him?

1053
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:35,828
I told you that the
Minister will support the PWD.

1054
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,228
Please sit, don't worry.

1055
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:41,668
Yes, sir.

1056
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:43,226
Has Kohli left or is he still there?

1057
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:47,968
I think he's gone.
- Good riddance.

1058
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,303
You come in.
- Here I am, sir.

1059
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:53,875
Sorry, sir.

1060
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,946
I knocked,
but you were on the intercom.

1061
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,249
Kohli, stop acting like
you're scared of me. - Sir.

1062
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,687
Kuwait is not our priority.

1063
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:04,816
Sir, I have only one request.

1064
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:08,988
You know our government is not stable.

1065
01:18:09,085 --> 01:18:11,827
There's no guarantee
how long we'll stay in power.

1066
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,164
Of course not sir..
- But you bureaucrats...

1067
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:16,429
...are here until your retirement.

1068
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:19,837
And something will happen
only if you want it to.

1069
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:22,675
You're right, sir.

1070
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:26,705
I've been waiting for
four hours to say exactly this.

1071
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:28,711
It's been four hours?

1072
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,784
Fine...

1073
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:34,713
...you guys handle it.

1074
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:45,861
Hello.

1075
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,668
Yes, hold on Kurien.

1076
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,068
Ranjit, it's Kurien.

1077
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:57,801
Hello. Yes.

1078
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,882
Fine. That's good.

1079
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,009
Fine.

1080
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:04,949
What happened?

1081
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:06,680
They're running out
of food in the camp.

1082
01:19:06,876 --> 01:19:07,786
So what are they doing?

1083
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,380
Kurien sent Ibrahim to the docks.

1084
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,915
There's some holding shed...

1085
01:19:11,981 --> 01:19:14,188
...where they used to buy
stuff for the supermarket.

1086
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,294
He saw some activity there.

1087
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:18,865
Now?
- So Kurien's going there.

1088
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,500
He might find something.

1089
01:19:20,723 --> 01:19:21,963
Shouldn't you be going?

1090
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:25,368
Why? Are you feeling
like yelling at George again?

1091
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,273
I go there, return empty handed...

1092
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,479
...George blames me,
and you yell at him

1093
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:34,271
And we get entertained in Kuwait.

1094
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:39,015
Come on, Ranjit.

1095
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:41,081
Ranjit.

1096
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:45,119
You're a negotiator, baby.

1097
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,754
They can't get what you can.

1098
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:51,492
What if I fail?

1099
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:54,459
You won't.

1100
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:56,759
You won't.

1101
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,267
Its not in your DNA

1102
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:14,387
It's definitely not a supply ship.

1103
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:16,914
Seems like they're
preparing to leave though

1104
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,314
Let's go take a look.

1105
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,760
Excuse me...are you Indian?

1106
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:34,103
Yes. Why?

1107
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:37,801
No... ls this ship going anywhere?

1108
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:43,012
Yes...is there a problem?

1109
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:46,277
No, I... Are they letting you out?

1110
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:48,117
We're taking garbage

1111
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:50,687
Garbage?

1112
01:20:50,746 --> 01:20:54,250
Hey fatso... Come here.

1113
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,825
who cares about
garbage in the middle of a war?

1114
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:02,796
I do. I am the captain of this ship.

1115
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:04,735
Our company has a contract for this.

1116
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,804
Anything else?

1117
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:09,099
Captain, how many people
can get on this ship?

1118
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:12,010
Around 500

1119
01:21:12,134 --> 01:21:13,875
But don't even think about it.

1120
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:15,472
Can you think about it if I pay you?

1121
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,087
Hey... Leave.

1122
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:29,887
Quickly. Double-march.

1123
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:35,024
I can.

1124
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:38,534
But not a single Kuwaiti.
- Of course.

1125
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:40,732
how much for a single person.

1126
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,006
5000 dollar.
- Hey...

1127
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:48,141
Who pays 5000 dollars for garbage?

1128
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:51,011
I can dump garbage in
the middle of the sea.

1129
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:52,515
Not you.

1130
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,852
Who do I have to take?
- What do you care about names?

1131
01:21:58,347 --> 01:21:59,826
I can pay you 200 dollars per person.

1132
01:22:03,819 --> 01:22:06,231
Why would I risk
my life for 200 dollars?

1133
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,097
You can for 100,000 dollars?

1134
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,468
200 dollars per person. 500 people

1135
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,562
100,000 dollars

1136
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,906
It's a two hours journey
The money will be all yours.

1137
01:22:18,968 --> 01:22:19,969
Let's go, Kurien.

1138
01:22:21,504 --> 01:22:22,380
N ow what?

1139
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,384
Don't look back,
keep walking straight.

1140
01:22:24,974 --> 01:22:26,317
Look straight...
- Wait a minute.

1141
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,250
Fine.

1142
01:22:28,978 --> 01:22:31,322
But they won't be my responsibility.

1143
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:32,515
Okay?

1144
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:35,392
Get the money and
the people at midnight.

1145
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:37,929
But not a single Kuwaiti.

1146
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:41,768
Poonawala.

1147
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:47,840
The Sheikhs are having a meeting.

1148
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,012
They didn't invite us.

1149
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:56,306
Wherever the ship takes you...

1150
01:22:56,372 --> 01:22:59,842
...you call Red Cross
and claim refugee status.

1151
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:01,986
I've spoken to the captain.

1152
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:04,990
It will be 200 dollars per person.

1153
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,824
You can all afford it.

1154
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:10,892
I personally feel,
it's a risk wonh taking.

1155
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,761
This is the army tank,
these are guns and this is the Police.

1156
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,870
Baby, why?

1157
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:21,072
Amrita, Simmu isn't ready yey?

1158
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:22,865
You haven't packed either.

1159
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:24,839
Why pack when we
aren't going anywhere?

1160
01:23:25,768 --> 01:23:26,974
Papa, give me my book.

1161
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:28,070
Give it back.

1162
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:33,715
Don't be childish.

1163
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:35,288
I think you've forgotten Punjabi.

1164
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:38,019
<i>"|'||</i> go wherever my husband goes."

1165
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,193
Don't force me, Ranjit.

1166
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,727
I'm not going anywhere without you.

1167
01:23:44,086 --> 01:23:45,360
And like you said...

1168
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:48,065
Our fate is entwined
with the fate of the others

1169
01:23:54,163 --> 01:23:56,302
Why don't you just admit
that your real problem is the garbage.

1170
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:06,318
Hello.

1171
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:08,819
Sanjeev Kohli, Mr. Katiyal.

1172
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:10,446
You've called after quite a while

1173
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:12,220
Where were you all these days?

1174
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:15,258
We||...| couldn't figure anything out

1175
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:18,398
But now we're talking to Jordan...

1176
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,265
...to let the Indians in Amman.

1177
01:24:21,323 --> 01:24:22,267
Amman?

1178
01:24:23,025 --> 01:24:25,232
Amman is 1000 kilometres from here.

1179
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,203
And we'll have to go through Iraq.

1180
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:29,500
Kohli sir, you can say it so easily.

1181
01:24:29,832 --> 01:24:31,106
But how will we get there?

1182
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,406
You see...this is
the only option we have.

1183
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,083
And even that is not confirmed.

1184
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,483
Then confirm it

1185
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:42,245
Because we can't stay here for long,
and that's confirmed

1186
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:43,781
Another thing Kohli sir.

1187
01:24:43,879 --> 01:24:46,291
I'm sending 500 people
on a ship from here.

1188
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:49,462
Please...try to get them asylum.

1189
01:24:49,852 --> 01:24:51,058
I'll give you the details.

1190
01:24:51,153 --> 01:24:52,393
And don't just stop there.

1191
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:54,131
There are still 150,000 left here.

1192
01:25:00,062 --> 01:25:05,102
Sir...how will we go with them...
- You go with Kurien

1193
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:07,340
Kurien, look after them.

1194
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,213
Don't worry.

1195
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:10,242
Come.

1196
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:18,291
Ranjit.

1197
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:23,292
Thank you, buddy.
- Good luck.

1198
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:24,958
Look after everyone.

1199
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:30,203
Ranjit. What did you say?

1200
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:34,264
First women and children
and then old men.

1201
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:35,971
But here only the rich are going.

1202
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:37,772
This is really, really unfair Mr.
Katiyal.

1203
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,846
Just because we can't give
the money... - Mr. Poonawala...

1204
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:41,210
...| know you don't have money.

1205
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:43,807
And all the people with
you don't have money either.

1206
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:45,852
I do...but I am not going.

1207
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,288
There's no point in getting
jealous of those who are going.

1208
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:52,154
And anyway, they're paying a price.
- And us?

1209
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:55,387
Should we look out for ourselves?
- I didn't say that.

1210
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:57,660
I am still here with you.

1211
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:01,326
Joseph, take the bus.
- Yes, sir.

1212
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:03,328
Look, Mr. Ranjit.
- Hey..

1213
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,670
Enough...in one moment

1214
01:26:09,031 --> 01:26:10,009
I'll prove Amrita wrong...

1215
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:12,078
...and go back to
being the old Ranjit...

1216
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:14,011
...which none of you will like.

1217
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,682
I am doing whatever I can.

1218
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,116
Don't ask for more.

1219
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:37,326
Heads down. Heads down.

1220
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:58,848
Give me. - Yeah take.

1221
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:04,321
Come on Simu.

1222
01:27:13,095 --> 01:27:15,905
Spicy Indian food and whiskey.

1223
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:20,313
I know you're a man of your words.

1224
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:25,217
Then...why are you cheating?

1225
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,411
Cheating?

1226
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:33,459
You said...| am the Emir now.

1227
01:27:34,116 --> 01:27:36,960
Wouldn't I know that...

1228
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:40,796
...you're illegally
sending 500 Indians out?

1229
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:50,808
They can still go...

1230
01:27:51,467 --> 01:27:54,505
Just pay the price to the Amir.

1231
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,550
I've already have.

1232
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:01,215
2 bottles of whiskey and this.

1233
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:09,261
I want 100,000 dollars.

1234
01:28:09,551 --> 01:28:11,121
I said I was wrong.

1235
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:14,028
You're not the Emir.

1236
01:28:18,994 --> 01:28:19,904
If you were the Emir...

1237
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,339
...then you would've know about
the deal I made in Baghdad.

1238
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:23,873
What deal?

1239
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,472
Talk to the External Minister.

1240
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,839
Everyone knows...
if the US intervenes...

1241
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:31,510
...|raq will no longer have Kuwait.

1242
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:34,847
But they will definitely
have the riches looted from Iraq.

1243
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:38,889
All that money
goes to the <i>Swiss</i> Bank.

1244
01:28:39,581 --> 01:28:42,960
And your government
has asked me to do this for them.

1245
01:28:45,954 --> 01:28:47,991
Call Baghdad and let the bus go.

1246
01:28:48,257 --> 01:28:51,170
Otherwise your President
Mr Saddam Hussien will

1247
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:52,432
hang you like he did Fawad...

1248
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,640
I want 100,000 dollars right now.

1249
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:14,853
May I please speek to Mr Tariq Aziz

1250
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,859
this is Ranjit Katiyal speaking
- Mr. Ranjit.

1251
01:29:16,919 --> 01:29:17,693
Please, stop.

1252
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:20,297
This is not necessary.

1253
01:29:20,622 --> 01:29:22,101
Please, finish dinner.

1254
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:25,898
I insist Major, please.

1255
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:38,343
Ranjit,
you never told me about the deal.

1256
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,914
There was no deal.

1257
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:42,987
Did you...

1258
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:44,690
I had no other option.

1259
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:46,382
What if he cross-checks?

1260
01:29:46,615 --> 01:29:49,186
No one can risk
cross-checking with Saddam.

1261
01:29:49,918 --> 01:29:51,397
But that Major...

1262
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:53,391
He'll definitely do something.

1263
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:55,195
I was just thinking that

1264
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,370
I hope I didn't risk
the lives of 150,000..

1265
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,104
...in order to save 500.

1266
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:14,579
Hello. - Mr. Katiyal, at this hour?

1267
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:15,950
Mr. Kohli, I am leaving
for Jordan in the morning...

1268
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:17,217
...a|ong with my people.

1269
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:17,950
Jordan?

1270
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,657
What happened?

1271
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:22,293
I never trusted the Iraqi army.

1272
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:23,930
The situation here is getting worse.

1273
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:26,363
But you can't go to Jordan just yet.

1274
01:30:26,488 --> 01:30:28,934
Look...we just started
negotiating with them...

1275
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:31,436
...and they haven't
made a decision yet.

1276
01:30:31,493 --> 01:30:33,439
Then get a decision taken, Mr. Kohli.

1277
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:34,902
We don't have an option.

1278
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:37,807
Trying to get there with
so many people is dangerous.

1279
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,504
Staying is
Kuwait is even more dangerous.

1280
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,372
Give me a few days.

1281
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:45,611
I'm talking to the
Civil Aviation ministry...

1282
01:30:45,707 --> 01:30:47,687
Mr. Kohli, please hurry up.

1283
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:50,253
Get the Jordan border to open for us.

1284
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,651
Because we're leaving.

1285
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:53,490
Goodnight.

1286
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:08,703
Hello.

1287
01:31:09,364 --> 01:31:11,366
Can I talk to Amrit Pal?

1288
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:14,639
I know it's late,
but it's very urgent.

1289
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:16,941
This is Kuwait and this is Jordan.

1290
01:31:17,072 --> 01:31:21,817
The distance from here
to here is 1091 kilometres.

1291
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:24,423
And for that I need all your help.

1292
01:31:24,546 --> 01:31:25,923
Take as many men as you can.

1293
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:33,925
Ahmed.

1294
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:09,165
Why can't I come?
- Why don't you understand?

1295
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:11,500
We're doing this for a reason.

1296
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,971
Mr. Poonawala, you get on that bus.

1297
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:14,803
Meher, go with your dad.

1298
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:16,934
Joseph, tell everyone...

1299
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:19,672
...that everyone leaves in
groups of 3-4 vehicles. - Okay.

1300
01:32:19,734 --> 01:32:21,236
And we all meet at Jahra border.
- Okay.

1301
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:22,873
And from there we go together.
- Okay, sir.

1302
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:25,883
Did you make sure some young men

1303
01:32:25,941 --> 01:32:27,579
are in each vehicle
- Yes...| did.

1304
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:28,586
0K8‘!-

1305
01:32:28,844 --> 01:32:30,050
Where's Ibrahim.

1306
01:32:30,145 --> 01:32:31,624
Sir, I don't know.

1307
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:33,187
Ok don't worry about it.

1308
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:46,537
So now you're making
a fuss instead of George.

1309
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:51,272
Sir, I won't go.

1310
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:54,271
Not without Shazin.

1311
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,740
It's not right for me to go.

1312
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:58,943
I'll stay here, and look for her.

1313
01:32:59,207 --> 01:33:02,347
If you want to find
her then move ahead.

1314
01:33:03,345 --> 01:33:05,325
By staying here you're proving...

1315
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:07,954
...that you've lost
all hope to see her.

1316
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,029
Try to look for her where
all Indians are going.

1317
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:12,689
Maybe...

1318
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,372
Good thing we are going from here.

1319
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:30,872
God knows what it will be like there.

1320
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,647
Whatever it is,
it will be better than here.

1321
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,991
What did she say?
- What?

1322
01:33:42,217 --> 01:33:44,128
She's your sponsor, right?

1323
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:45,956
Sponsor...
- She's a Kuwaiti?

1324
01:33:46,822 --> 01:33:48,358
You worked for her, didn't you?

1325
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:49,193
No, sir...

1326
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:50,836
Why are you getting involved?

1327
01:33:51,093 --> 01:33:53,937
He's the kid, not me.

1328
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:55,733
She spoke in Arabic.

1329
01:33:56,031 --> 01:33:57,601
You're a Kuwaiti, aren't you?

1330
01:33:57,666 --> 01:33:58,736
I'm telling you...

1331
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:00,073
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1332
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,080
George sir.

1333
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:03,207
Where are you going?

1334
01:34:05,173 --> 01:34:06,811
Why did you get off the bus now?

1335
01:34:06,908 --> 01:34:08,216
You need me to get something
in writing from Saddam?

1336
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:11,284
You weren't able to,
but I found out.

1337
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:13,757
A time-bomb is ticking
in the bus. - What?

1338
01:34:14,082 --> 01:34:17,063
The woman travelling with Preethi,
she's a Kuwaiti.

1339
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:19,758
I know that.
- You know.

1340
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:23,028
And yet you let her stay in the camp.

1341
01:34:23,258 --> 01:34:24,896
If the Iraqi army
would have found out...

1342
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,769
...they would've cut
us all to pieces that day.

1343
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:28,398
They didn't find out,
you're still alive, aren't you?

1344
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:29,370
Let's go.

1345
01:34:29,431 --> 01:34:31,308
ls this ajoke, Mr. Ranjit?

1346
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:35,314
If the Iraqi army finds out...

1347
01:34:35,370 --> 01:34:39,318
...that we're taking
a Kuwaiti in our bus...

1348
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:41,779
...then our lives will be in danger.

1349
01:34:42,444 --> 01:34:44,720
Leave a woman and
a child behind to die...

1350
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:47,856
...on|y because she's a Kuwaiti?

1351
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:51,160
I can't do that, George.

1352
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,021
What?

1353
01:34:53,388 --> 01:34:56,665
That Kuwaiti life
is imponant to you..

1354
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:59,031
...not ours?

1355
01:34:59,928 --> 01:35:02,465
You have no right to do this.

1356
01:35:02,998 --> 01:35:04,136
This is wrong.

1357
01:35:10,272 --> 01:35:11,342
Ranjit.

1358
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:17,216
Ask her to come out.
- Sir.

1359
01:35:17,312 --> 01:35:20,156
Tell her to come out.
- Sir, where will she go?

1360
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:21,694
You come out first.

1361
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:22,993
Come out.

1362
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:24,352
Come out.

1363
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:26,793
Give me the kid.

1364
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:29,861
Sir. - Come.

1365
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:32,269
Sir, please.
- Come.

1366
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:35,033
Sir...
- Come on.

1367
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:36,732
Sir.
- Let's go.

1368
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:39,678
Come on.

1369
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:45,784
Get down.

1370
01:35:52,046 --> 01:35:54,048
Do I have the right to risk my life...

1371
01:35:55,383 --> 01:35:57,192
Or should I get that in writing too?

1372
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:01,632
Get into the bus.

1373
01:36:17,172 --> 01:36:20,085
She's Tasneem.
She'll be going with us to Amman.

1374
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:21,413
She's a Kuwaiti.

1375
01:36:22,644 --> 01:36:24,248
You can come with us, in our car.

1376
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:30,753
"The desire of my eyes..."

1377
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:36,668
"...is to keep staring at your face."

1378
01:36:37,392 --> 01:36:42,364
"My slumbers are fi||ed..."

1379
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:47,774
"...with only your dreams."

1380
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:51,117
"They all lead me to you..."

1381
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:53,982
"...a|| the paths in the world."

1382
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:57,021
"| love you so much."

1383
01:36:57,178 --> 01:37:01,058
"You cannot imagine."

1384
01:38:29,938 --> 01:38:33,078
Go meet Mr. Tripathi, okay.

1385
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:35,316
Kohli, we've forwarded the proposal.

1386
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:37,219
And we're talking
to the Air-Force chief.

1387
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:38,518
We'll have to Airlift them.

1388
01:38:38,947 --> 01:38:41,553
But sir, 170,000 people
in Air-Force planes?

1389
01:38:42,884 --> 01:38:45,421
I know it's not possible.
- So then?

1390
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,431
The Air India Chief has
been summoned in the morning.

1391
01:38:50,225 --> 01:38:52,205
Air India planes can do it,
can't they?

1392
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:54,872
But, sir...civi|ian
aircraft in a war zone?

1393
01:38:55,029 --> 01:38:56,133
That's crazy.

1394
01:39:04,305 --> 01:39:05,579
Two dates.

1395
01:39:05,974 --> 01:39:07,920
Are we breaking a
fast or eating a meal?

1396
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:09,453
I'll take it if he doesn't want it.

1397
01:39:12,847 --> 01:39:13,484
Here you go.

1398
01:39:13,815 --> 01:39:15,852
No, mom, no dates.
Something else.

1399
01:39:16,317 --> 01:39:18,058
Baby, eat this now.

1400
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:20,224
We'll eat 'ja|ebis'
when we get to India, okay.

1401
01:39:20,488 --> 01:39:21,523
Good girl.

1402
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:29,206
You must help us with the evacuation.

1403
01:39:29,464 --> 01:39:33,037
We're commercial pilots, sir.
Not the Indian Air Force.

1404
01:39:33,101 --> 01:39:35,172
Look, we already had a
word with the Air India chief.

1405
01:39:35,237 --> 01:39:35,977
So?

1406
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:37,977
We have to fly planes
Into a war zone, not him

1407
01:39:38,173 --> 01:39:38,913
Yes.

1408
01:39:39,007 --> 01:39:41,248
And if we wanted to risk our lives...

1409
01:39:41,409 --> 01:39:43,218
...then we would've
joined the Air Force.

1410
01:39:43,377 --> 01:39:45,448
Why don't you volunteer
to fly the plane?

1411
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:46,884
Sir, can I talk to them.

1412
01:39:53,121 --> 01:39:55,328
Look, there's no
question of forcing you.

1413
01:39:56,524 --> 01:39:58,333
It's your choice
whether you go or not.

1414
01:39:58,626 --> 01:40:02,164
But 175,000 people are
waiting for us in Jordan.

1415
01:40:03,864 --> 01:40:05,070
And their only fault is...

1416
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:07,306
...that they're Indians,
but not our kin.

1417
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:11,174
I can't give you a reason...

1418
01:40:11,272 --> 01:40:12,945
...to risk your lives for them.

1419
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,046
It's best that you
find one yourselves...

1420
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:18,488
...that would save their lives.

1421
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:42,937
Meher.

1422
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:47,786
I've seen so much news.

1423
01:40:48,576 --> 01:40:52,114
But never thought that someday
we'll be the news.

1424
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,323
Indian Refugees in
Kuwait Because of Iraq.

1425
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:00,663
It's so confusing, isn't it?

1426
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:10,200
Oh yes...

1427
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:13,310
The Minister was asking...

1428
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:15,080
...who's going to pay for all this?

1429
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:19,678
I think the Finance Ministry
will have to jump in.

1430
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:23,950
Will you talk to them or should l?

1431
01:41:24,145 --> 01:41:25,215
You do it, sir.

1432
01:41:25,713 --> 01:41:26,783
You see, they have no documents...

1433
01:41:26,848 --> 01:41:29,795
...so I'll try and get
temporary passpons issued.

1434
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:57,812
Ranjit.

1435
01:41:58,279 --> 01:41:59,257
Ranjit.

1436
01:42:07,054 --> 01:42:08,431
Don't get out of the car?

1437
01:42:12,694 --> 01:42:13,672
Officer, Indian.

1438
01:42:13,728 --> 01:42:16,140
Indian.
We all Indian.

1439
01:42:16,731 --> 01:42:18,301
We got permission
from President Saddam...

1440
01:42:18,366 --> 01:42:19,902
Papers...
- To go to Jordan.

1441
01:42:20,068 --> 01:42:20,842
Passport

1442
01:42:20,902 --> 01:42:21,972
Show me the passport

1443
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,309
Don't try to ruin things now.

1444
01:42:24,372 --> 01:42:25,442
Get back.

1445
01:42:25,673 --> 01:42:26,310
Show me the passport

1446
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:27,478
I don't have passport No passport

1447
01:42:27,709 --> 01:42:28,710
But we assure you...
- Kuwaiti.

1448
01:42:28,776 --> 01:42:30,153
Kuwaiti. Kuwaiti.

1449
01:42:30,211 --> 01:42:31,485
Kuwaiti.
- No, no, no...we're not Kuwaiti.

1450
01:42:31,846 --> 01:42:32,756
Stop it.

1451
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:35,693
Passport Passport
- Stay inside, Amrita.

1452
01:42:40,955 --> 01:42:42,866
Indian. We're Indians, sir.

1453
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:46,233
Two more people.

1454
01:42:46,294 --> 01:42:47,705
I want two more passpons.
- No, no, no.

1455
01:42:47,795 --> 01:42:49,433
They are all Indians.
We don't have passpons.

1456
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:50,708
Kuwaiti?
- No, no, no...

1457
01:42:50,765 --> 01:42:51,800
No, Indian.

1458
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:52,707
Kuwaiti...

1459
01:42:52,767 --> 01:42:55,145
We're Indian. Indian.
- Kuwaiti. - No, Indian.

1460
01:42:55,303 --> 01:42:57,715
Indian. Indian.

Dollar. Money.
- You take your money, I take your wife.

1462
01:43:03,244 --> 01:43:05,520
She's a Kuwaiti.
Let my boys have some fun.

1463
01:43:52,994 --> 01:43:54,098
Ranjit.

1464
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:56,542
Stop it. Leave me.

1465
01:43:56,965 --> 01:43:57,909
Ranjit.

1466
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:59,043
Ranjit.

1467
01:44:00,001 --> 01:44:00,945
Ranjit.

1468
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:03,346
Help!

1469
01:44:06,107 --> 01:44:07,450
Please, no...

1470
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:11,546
Please, don't.
Please.

1471
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:40,944
Drop your gun...and you all can live.

1472
01:45:15,443 --> 01:45:17,980
No, no, no...it can't be
done at your level, Mr. Kohli.

1473
01:45:18,112 --> 01:45:20,752
Why are you arguing, Mr. Chapekar?

1474
01:45:21,349 --> 01:45:24,421
I told you that the Minister
from Kuwait division...

1475
01:45:24,485 --> 01:45:27,261
Mr. Kohli, without confirming
at the secretary level...

1476
01:45:27,355 --> 01:45:30,495
...at the Amman embassy,
we can't issue temporary passpons.

1477
01:45:30,725 --> 01:45:31,726
Please try and understand.

1478
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:32,964
Let people come in...

1479
01:45:33,027 --> 01:45:36,201
...and I'll ask the Minister himself
to speak to you.

1480
01:45:56,417 --> 01:45:57,794
What now?

1481
01:45:57,952 --> 01:45:59,158
Will he open the gate?

1482
01:46:10,798 --> 01:46:11,936
Well done Kohli.

1483
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:03,124
Sir...

1484
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:04,821
Sir, what now?

1485
01:47:04,985 --> 01:47:05,963
Where are the others?

1486
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:07,931
Some got down with Joseph.

1487
01:47:08,022 --> 01:47:09,831
And the rest are sitting on the buses.

1488
01:47:10,858 --> 01:47:13,304
Excuse me. Mr. Katiyal.

1489
01:47:13,361 --> 01:47:15,637
One question.
- Not now.

1490
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,400
Mr. Poonawala,
please go sit in the bus.

1491
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,202
Not now.
- Ranjit.

1492
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:20,905
There are flags from all countries...

1493
01:47:21,102 --> 01:47:22,740
...but where's the Indian ﬂag?

1494
01:47:24,005 --> 01:47:26,383
Do one thing, take her.
- Yes.

1495
01:47:26,807 --> 01:47:28,878
Hold my hand, Simu.
- Move.

1496
01:47:38,853 --> 01:47:41,060
Mr. Kohli, I cou|d've
insisted for written orders...

1497
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:42,066
But I am not.

1498
01:47:43,224 --> 01:47:44,328
Please hold on.

1499
01:47:44,859 --> 01:47:45,633
Hello.

1500
01:47:45,826 --> 01:47:46,804
Yes, Mohan.

1501
01:47:47,195 --> 01:47:48,003
Huh?

1502
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:50,738
They're at the airpon.
- They've already arrived...

1503
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:52,368
...and you're still
stuck in red tape.

1504
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:54,669
Mr. Kohli.
Will you please keep quiet?

1505
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:55,746
P|ease.!

1506
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:56,713
Hello...

1507
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:58,374
Yeah, I'll do something.

1508
01:47:58,706 --> 01:48:00,083
Give me sometime, I'll do something.

1509
01:48:00,908 --> 01:48:04,014
Chapekar sir...they are our people.

1510
01:48:04,712 --> 01:48:06,783
They've already suffered a lot.

1511
01:48:07,014 --> 01:48:08,425
Please don't make
them suffer any more...

1512
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:10,151
...by waiting for orders.

1513
01:48:10,284 --> 01:48:11,319
Please.

1514
01:48:12,086 --> 01:48:12,894
Excuse me.

1515
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:13,998
Excuse me.

1516
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:18,363
We're around 170,000 Indians...

1517
01:48:18,426 --> 01:48:19,734
who've come from Kuwait.

1518
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:21,898
And we've no clue what to do.

1519
01:48:22,096 --> 01:48:24,337
Look, all the people
standing outside...

1520
01:48:24,465 --> 01:48:26,411
...are waiting for
the same information.

1521
01:48:26,767 --> 01:48:27,768
You have to wait too, please.

1522
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:29,143
Saddam has barged into our homes...

1523
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:30,715
...and you're asking us to wait.

1524
01:48:31,172 --> 01:48:34,119
Look...no point in getting heated up.

1525
01:48:34,475 --> 01:48:36,716
I really don't know any1hing.

1526
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:37,719
Please.

1527
01:48:41,749 --> 01:48:42,489
Hello.

1528
01:48:42,717 --> 01:48:43,787
Yes, from Delhi.

1529
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:44,994
Yes.

1530
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:46,721
Yes, sir.

1531
01:48:46,787 --> 01:48:47,857
Okay, sir.

1532
01:48:47,955 --> 01:48:50,492
Okay, sir.
Thank you.

1533
01:49:15,983 --> 01:49:20,983
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

1534
01:49:29,697 --> 01:49:34,544
"You kept living on..."

1535
01:49:35,102 --> 01:49:41,542
"...and he kept dying for you."

1536
01:49:41,942 --> 01:49:48,552
"When he heard you moan with pain..."

1537
01:49:49,116 --> 01:49:55,499
...he came to your rescue,
leaving every1hing behind.

1538
01:49:55,623 --> 01:50:01,733
"With happiness in your path."

1539
01:50:02,663 --> 01:50:08,670
"He's with you at every turn."

1540
01:50:08,969 --> 01:50:14,783
"Leaving every1hing behind."

1541
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:21,787
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

1542
01:50:22,650 --> 01:50:28,498
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

1543
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:01,189
Next.

1544
01:51:01,522 --> 01:51:02,592
Behram Poonawala.

1545
01:51:06,227 --> 01:51:07,035
Yes, next.

1546
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,106
Meher Poonawala.
- Daljit Singh.

1547
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:14,138
Next.

1548
01:51:14,702 --> 01:51:15,874
Your name?

1549
01:51:17,238 --> 01:51:18,308
Ma'am, what's your name?

1550
01:51:18,872 --> 01:51:19,748
Shazin.

1551
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,050
Shazin what?

1552
01:51:21,775 --> 01:51:22,753
Shazin. Durrani.

1553
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:25,286
And you?
- Ibrahim Durrani.

1554
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:26,915
Husband-wife?

1555
01:51:30,084 --> 01:51:36,330
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

1556
01:51:36,891 --> 01:51:43,172
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

1557
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:50,080
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

1558
01:51:50,337 --> 01:51:56,049
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

1559
01:51:56,276 --> 01:52:01,276
"The tears that were..."

1560
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:12,662
"With happiness in your path."

1561
01:52:12,893 --> 01:52:15,100
How did you decide the seating?

1562
01:52:15,629 --> 01:52:17,768
Meaning, who sits in first class...

1563
01:52:17,831 --> 01:52:19,071
...and who sits in economy?

1564
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:20,370
Well, I'll just check on that, sir.

1565
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:21,303
Excuse me.

1566
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:23,946
Otherwise it's very unfair.

1567
01:52:25,573 --> 01:52:26,347
Kohli.

1568
01:52:28,609 --> 01:52:29,679
Congratulations.

1569
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:31,683
The first ﬂighfs about to take-off.

1570
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:47,762
"Vande Mataram!"

1571
01:52:49,797 --> 01:52:53,677
"Vande Mataram!"

1572
01:52:53,868 --> 01:52:55,711
The World's biggest rescue operation.

1573
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:57,472
Air India, Indian Airlines...

1574
01:52:57,538 --> 01:53:00,883
...and Indian Air Force
pilots flew 488 such flights.

1575
01:53:01,142 --> 01:53:04,385
The world has never witnessed nor will
probably ever witness...

1576
01:53:04,445 --> 01:53:07,016
a rescue operation of this scale:

1577
01:53:07,515 --> 01:53:09,927
India brought home, over a 100,000 of
her citizens

1578
01:53:10,384 --> 01:53:11,658
...who were stuck in another country.

1579
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:15,427
And we've brought our
people back safe and sound.

1580
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:20,798
Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

1581
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:27,408
Those we never met, and never
got the chance to meet later...

1582
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:30,709
Many government officers
like Sanjeev Kohli...

1583
01:53:30,871 --> 01:53:32,145
...made this possible.

1584
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,017
Birdy flew.

1585
01:53:35,776 --> 01:53:36,982
Plane flew.

1586
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:39,889
Simu flew.
- No.

1587
01:53:39,947 --> 01:53:40,982
Mom flew.

1588
01:53:41,548 --> 01:53:43,528
I flew.
How can I ﬂy?

1589
01:53:57,097 --> 01:54:02,012
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

1590
01:54:02,936 --> 01:54:05,143
Even today I get upset
over some problems in India.

1591
01:54:05,606 --> 01:54:06,812
I am still cynical.

1592
01:54:06,907 --> 01:54:09,251
But after boarding that last flight...

1593
01:54:09,643 --> 01:54:13,056
...| have never asked, what
has my country done for me.

1594
01:54:45,279 --> 01:54:50,279
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

1595
01:54:58,792 --> 01:55:03,400
"You kept living on..."

1596
01:55:04,398 --> 01:55:10,542
"...and he kept dying for you."

1597
01:55:11,205 --> 01:55:17,645
"When he heard you moan with pain..."

1598
01:55:18,345 --> 01:55:24,387
...he came to your rescue,
leaving every1hing behind.

1599
01:55:24,652 --> 01:55:30,762
"With happiness in your path."

1600
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:37,769
"He's with you at every turn."

1601
01:55:38,265 --> 01:55:42,805
"Leaving every1hing behind."

1602
01:55:46,373 --> 01:55:51,373
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

1603
01:56:59,246 --> 01:57:04,924
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

1604
01:57:05,952 --> 01:57:12,494
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

1605
01:57:12,726 --> 01:57:19,075
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

1606
01:57:19,533 --> 01:57:25,074
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

1607
01:57:25,372 --> 01:57:30,372
"The tears that were..."

1608
01:57:38,685 --> 01:57:44,795
"With happiness in your path."

1609
01:57:45,759 --> 01:57:52,005
"He's with you at every turn."

1610
01:57:52,065 --> 01:57:56,741
"Leaving every1hing behind."

1611
01:58:00,374 --> 01:58:05,374
The one you forgot...
kept remembering you.

1612
01:58:40,947 --> 01:58:47,626
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

1613
01:58:47,788 --> 01:58:54,364
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

1614
01:58:54,494 --> 01:59:01,002
Each of his moment
passed worrying about you.

1615
01:59:01,368 --> 01:59:07,148
The world was with you...
while he was all alone.

1616
01:59:07,374 --> 01:59:12,374
"The tears that were..."

1617
01:59:20,487 --> 01:59:27,496
"With happiness in your path."

1618
01:59:27,561 --> 01:59:33,807
"He's with you at every turn."

1619
01:59:33,867 --> 01:59:37,542
"Leaving every1hing behind."

1620
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:59,132
"Vande Mataram!"

1621
02:00:00,727 --> 02:00:07,474
"Vande Mataram!"

1622
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:14,110
"Vande Mataram!"

1623
02:00:14,174 --> 02:00:21,524
"Vande Mataram!"
