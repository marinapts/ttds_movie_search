327
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,239
I wonder what would happen
if you applied Penrose's
theory about black holes

to the entire universe.

329
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,116
If Einstein is right, or if
general relativity is correct,

330
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,289
then the universe
is expanding, yes?

331
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,786
Yes.
Okay.

332
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,290
So, if you reverse time,
then the universe
is getting smaller.

333
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,371
All right.

334
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,630
So, what if I reverse the
process all the way back,

335
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,803
to see what happened at the
beginning of time itself?

336
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,972
At the beginning of time itself?
Yes.

337

Yeah.

521
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,390
So, Stephen,
in summary, um,

522
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,143
as we know, chapter one,
full of holes, uh,

523
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,646
lacks mathematical support.

524
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,522
Professor Thorne?
Chapter two, not really original.

525
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,485
Uses a lot of Roger's ideas.

526
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,987
Well, at least
you run with them.

527
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:48,071
Uh, chapter three, too many
unanswered questions.

528
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,284
SCIAMA: I agree.

529
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,913
And then, of course,
we have chapter four.

530
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,835
This black hole at
the beginning of time.

531

Brilliant, Stephen.

00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,087
Superb.

534
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,132
Therefore, all there is
to say is well done.

535
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,426
Or perhaps I should say,
to be more precise,

536

(LIQUID POURING)

814
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,956
I'd like to make
a suggestion.

815
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,375
Might sound a bit unusual,
but I have seen it
work wonders.

816
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,503
I think

817
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,631
that you should consider
joining the church choir.

Mum,

820
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:42,814
I think that's possibly
the most English thing
anyone has ever said.

821
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,693
Maybe so.

822
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,067
I used to love singing.

823
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,986
You're very good at it.

824
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,072
I don't know about that.

825
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,573
Just go.

826
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,952
It's one hour a week.

01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,083
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm.

830
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,045
Okay. See you next week.

Um...

836
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,436
I just came to, um...

Yes, thank you. Yes.

01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,168

Um, and if your son wants
those piano lessons, just...

01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,725
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I, <i>um...</i> Call me.

01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:50,934

Great.

Does he play?

856
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,440
Um...

857
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,489
I could teach him,
as well. Um...

858
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,246
That's a long story.

859
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,703

Ah, okay.

(CHUCKLING) Good.
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

868
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,550
JANE: More wine?

869
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,427
Um, why not?
Thank you.

No.

01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,036
(JONATHAN CLEARING THROAT)

872
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,618
Stephen, Jane was telling me
that you have
a beautiful, uh, theorem.

873
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,289
Um...

874
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,508
That proves that
the universe, um,

875
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,460
had a beginning.
Is that it?

876
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,846
That was my PhD thesis.

877
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:53,436
My new project
disproves it.

878
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,776
Uh, disproves it? Oh.
Yes.

879
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,732
Um, so then you no longer
believe in the creation?

880
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:08,285
What one believes
is irrelevant in physics.

881
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,244
"Irrelevant in physics."

882
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,330
Oh. (CLEARING THROAT)

883
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,168
I see.

884
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,626
Stephen's done a U-turn.

885
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:20,208
The big new idea is that the
universe has no boundaries at all.

886
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,048
No boundaries,
no beginning.

887
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,130
And no God. Oh.

888
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:29,309
Oh, I see. I... (CHUCKLES)
I thought that, um,

889
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:33,389
you'd proved the universe
had a beginning
and thus a need for a creator.

890
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,016
(CHUCKLES) My mistake.

891
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,152
No, mine.

892
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,899
Stephen is looking
for a single theory

893
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,531
that explains all the
forces in the universe.

894
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,575
Therefore, God must die.

895
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,157
Oh, uh, why must God die?
I don't see.

896
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,786
The two great pillars
of physics

897
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,463
are quantum theory,

898
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,876
the laws that govern
the very small particles,
electrons and so on,

899
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,883
and general relativity.

900
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,680
Ah, yes, Einstein.

901
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,265
Einstein's theory,
the laws that govern

902
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,138
the very large planets
and such.

903
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,312
But quantum and relativity...

904
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,389
Don't tell me.
They're different?

905
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,559
They don't remotely
play by the same rules.

906
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:24,114
If the world were all
potatoes, then, easy.

907
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,908
You could trace
a precise beginning

908
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,735
as Stephen once did.

909
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,078
A moment of creation.

910
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,540
Hallelujah. God lives.

911
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,763
If you incorporate peas
into the menu,

912
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,415
well, then it all
goes a little...

913
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,959
Tits up.
Oh. (CHUCKLING)

914
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,133
Yes. Haywire.

915
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,427
It just all becomes
a godless mess.
Oh, dear.

916
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,088
(CHUCKLING)
Einstein hated peas.

917
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,511
Quantum theory. He said,
"God doesn't play dice
with the universe."

918
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,435
STEPHEN: Seems
he not only plays dice,

919
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:02,940
but he throws them
where we can't find them.

920
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,656
God is back on
the endangered species list.

is back in business.

<i>Physics is</i> back <i>in business.</i>

(EXHALING)

929
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,815
it was, uh, leukemia.

930

Um, she fought it
and I nursed her.

931

But music is my salvation.

JANE: So,
how does it work?

1196
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,597
It uses
a very simple interface

1197
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,227
that scans
through the alphabet,

1198
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:07,400
selects each letter
one at a time.

1199
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,024
I mean,
using this technique,
the Professor can expect

<i>I first met the Professor</i>

1301
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:53,217
<i>in 1963.</i>

1302
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:55,473
<i>Now there you are. Time!</i>

1303
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:56,853
<i>Where does it go?</i>

1304
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:00,308
<i>It has been
one of the great joys</i>

1305
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:05,147
<i>of my life to watch this man
defy every expectation,</i>

1306
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:08,199
<i>both scientific and personal.</i>

1307
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:13,116
<i>Please welcome onto the stage
my esteemed colleague,</i>

1308
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:16,953
<i>my dear friend,
Professor Hawking.</i>

1309
01:48:17,074 --> 01:48:18,496
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1310
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,593
<i>Thank you.
Could we please have</i>

1311
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:38,646
<i>the first pre-selected
question? Thank you.</i>

1312
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:46,445
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1313
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,863
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1314
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:52,276
Now you are
recognized everywhere.

1315
01:48:53,277 --> 01:48:55,245
How do you deal
with all the attention?

1316
01:48:55,779 --> 01:48:59,283
<i>I was stopped recently
by a tourist in Cambridge,</i>

1317
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:02,286
<i>who asked if I was
the real Stephen Hawking.</i>

1318
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:07,800
<i>I replied I was not
and said the real one
was much better looking.</i>

1319
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:14,306
In 1979, you talked
about the possibility

1320
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:17,885
of a theory of everything
being discovered
before the end of the century.

1321
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:22,014
<i>I now predict
that I was wrong.</i>

1322
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:27,978
Professor Hawking,

1323
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:30,739
you have said you do not
believe in God.

1324
01:49:32,733 --> 01:49:35,577
Do you have a philosophy of life
that helps you? (FADES OFF)

1325
01:50:38,757 --> 01:50:41,135
You have said
you do not believe in God.

1326
01:50:43,262 --> 01:50:45,640
Do you have a philosophy
of life that helps you?

1327
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:12,876
<i>It is clear that we are
just an advanced breed
of primates</i>

1328
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:17,255
<i>on a minor planet orbiting
around a very average star</i>

1329
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:22,268
<i>in the outer suburb of one
among 100 billion galaxies.</i>

1330
01:51:24,094 --> 01:51:25,095
<i>But,</i>

1331
01:51:25,762 --> 01:51:28,185
<i>ever since
the dawn of civilization,</i>

1332
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:31,068
<i>people have craved
for an understanding</i>

1333
01:51:31,143 --> 01:51:33,396
<i>of the underlying order
of the world.</i>

1334
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:37,863
<i>There ought to be
something very special</i>

1335
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:41,070
<i>about the boundary conditions
of the universe.</i>

1336
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:45,958
<i>And what can be more special
than that
there is no boundary...</i>

1337
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:52,164
<i>And there should be no
boundary to human endeavor.</i>

1338
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:55,926
<i>We are all different.</i>

1339
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:58,761
<i>However bad life may seem,</i>

1340
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:02,471
<i>there is always something
you can do and succeed at.</i>

1341
01:52:04,092 --> 01:52:07,062
<i>While there is life,
there is hope.</i>

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

1343
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:29,368
That came.

1344
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,046
It's from Stephen.

1345
01:52:48,303 --> 01:52:49,304
Gosh.

1346
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,543
Your glasses are always dirty.

Hawking, Her Majesty the Queen.

Congratulations...

My Companion of Honour.

1350
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:13,438
Not bad
for an old liberal socialist.

1351
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,359
(WHISPERS) Don't worry, you
can decline the knighthood.

1352
01:54:29,237 --> 01:54:31,160
Thank you, for today.

1353
01:54:32,616 --> 01:54:33,833
It was extraordinary.

1354
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:38,129
It's all been rather
extraordinary though, hasn't it?

01:55:00,811 --> 01:55:03,985
<i>Look what we made.</i>
