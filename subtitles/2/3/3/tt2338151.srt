To count the stars in our galaxy, at least'll have at least 6,000 years.

The thief was taken, the spacecraft is summoned to the machine

16
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,567
The remote controller can not go back to his house without him ..

17
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:24,344
He does not know our language ..

To go somewhere far away ..

24
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,332

- No.

284
00:24:54,274 --> 00:24:56,045
God is not found in religion.

285
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,973
That's news to earn God's.

286

They are not born spots.

295
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:23,168
Your father අදරණීය friend, that lifestyle is not it?

From then on, I decided, is to live in this country ..

I have a program. You can go.

After the truce again, we were talking businessman with gold නතානිවාලා.

302
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:48,577
Find more about the story, do not ever given the opportunity.

303
00:25:48,972 --> 00:25:52,821
But two weeks later, it came back to my life story.

Pandit .. Those are mine.

316
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:52,928
Once, when he was named in his hands.

00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,739
A signal coming, he visits one to take me a homeland.

402
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:57,643
They might think. It's a dangerous world that. I lived out here to die.

403
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,729
Hey ... Listen.

404
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:08,531

Look I'm not a thief. - This is what is always steals.

407
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:19,038
Where Mr. Pandya? You talk to him. - Mr. Pandya go on patrol.

408
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:21,196

00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:25,933
- Pandya all. - Hey girl, shut up. Or give ear ..

410
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,210
You think I'm crazy, crazy to do ..?

411
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:50,654
Or else what?

412
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:55,304
Your planet බෝජ්පූරිද official language?

413
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:58,851
Our world ...

414
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:01,858
What did our first language in the world. Talk to your mind. No problem.

415
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,818
Here is one. Means another one.

416
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:06,643
This means that for four months ... ..

417
00:35:07,968 --> 00:35:10,301
Says this is good .. that good.

418
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:12,475
Never mind everything else not so good

419
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:15,529
Big eyes told them,

420
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,045
Like wonder what that means ...

421
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:20,330
"Your mother accident ... good / right ...." Qur'an like.

422
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,846
.. When someone angry tone sound more.

423
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:27,576
"But ... but ... I come to teach"

424
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,115
Some thinking while continuing to paint word.

425
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:34,019
"But ......"

426
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:38,003
Pay attention to your feelings by preaching's young.

427
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,146
Then the point is that one can realize that.

428
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,296
Escape the chaos. I understand went to six hours.

429
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:50,104
It is learned completely බෝජ්පූරී're six hours. Nobody did not catch up.

430
00:35:51,017 --> 00:35:54,453
One girl, who gave her support.

431
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,977
So I exchanged her to complete my move.

432
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,342
You're going to have a brain like that one laughing.

433
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,746
Making a false kind of stuff you have cherished.

434
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,738
Like an USB cable .. if your hands?

435
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:07,992
B transfer files to another computer is a computer ...?

436
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,928
And your clothes ..?

437
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:14,031
Like you are wearing a pair of your planet b ..

438
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,261
No no no .. .. Our world, our world who are not අඳින්නෙම clothes.

439
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:23,507
As soon as I got homesick, came here ..

440
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,396
Our world different from those of the skin, the skin here.

441
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:32,871
Some of the other co-equal bright .. කළුම black look.

442
00:36:34,037 --> 00:36:36,696
Someone's skin color, cataracts another person a while.

443
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:41,323
He sticks the skin of her body .. someone hanging down.

444
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:45,949
Then one day I saw a car.

445
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,187
Dancing car.

446
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:59,408
As I understood, that is capable of and we're here.

447
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:04,805
The difference here is all they are wearing something that fashion over her body.

448
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:16,398
Then I realized how does the mix with here.

449
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,969
Oh, that is it, people are laughing.

450
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:30,674
After that, I understood little, men women විලාසිතාවනුයි විලාසිතාවනුයි to change.

451
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:34,507
One night .. one fashion style lunch.

452
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,038
One one hand playing style dining style ..

453
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:44,307
One of my clothes catch, a picture.

454
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:03,095
I went slowly realize, is that to live in this world to survive in the picture.

455
00:38:03,587 --> 00:38:06,309
This brings the picture will eat.

456
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,047
So I started to collect pictures of this old man.

457
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:26,936
What man ...

458
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:33,576
Why do I have these ..?

459
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,797
What this book to my store.

460
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:45,954
B .. .... you have to take carrots.

461
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:51,660
I realize that this picture is only one nation that is useful paper.

462
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,707
The other does not make the paper.

463
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:02,095
The need for clothes like the car was able to complete with dancing.

464
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:05,412
He did the same to my bank, I had the same clothes were coming hard

465
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:09,689
Once it got kind of a strange uniform,

466
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,895
The suit, because that has no picture,

467
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,982
The food comes to their own kind.

468
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,950
Mr. take this.

469
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:23,140
I realized that if I find a remote control that other people in the world to learn the language.

470
00:39:23,624 --> 00:39:26,481
Language can not or do not work here any.

471
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:31,735
Just like he could not say that even if Mr. style ..

472
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,097
I thought I was bad in his style that persists.

473
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,620
So I tried again, as you put it.

474
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,633
Am I met ඉන්ඳැද්දී down the road.

475
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,268
Am right to confront someone put some Douchebag go away.

476
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:24,784
If the mind is not as nice.

477
00:40:26,371 --> 00:40:28,133
Nothing has not responded.

478
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:31,077
Deaf ears do not know.

479
00:40:31,926 --> 00:40:32,926
The catch ........

480
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,806
Hear. No answers.

481
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:40,218
Firm's shot in the head like.

482
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,234
Memory lost.

483
00:40:42,813 --> 00:40:44,202
Memory gone.

484
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,064
Do you remember who hits you?

485
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,730
Remember අංකේ car?

486
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,380
Remember what is right?

487
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:35,975
Let's brother.

488
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:38,324
Go with me.

489
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:43,395
As long as you come back to your memory of my guests.

490
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,600
Take your head nails ටොක said.

If you want to know what this husband and I discovered that I need to work hand in his language exchange.

495
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,034
The name of the car is ...

496
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:10,812
Oh, I lost .. .. Ask men to know the difference forgot now ...?

Look at my driver's license.

499
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:16,724
Gender.

500
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:18,842
Men. Man.

501
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:20,762
Anything.

502
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,920
If I go back in the house ..

503
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:26,285
Was definitely one that should catch someone's hand.

504
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:47,227
Mate, friend has had a colorful ..

Where in Patna, where the පාටන් or පටියාලා complaints ..

516
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:23,429
You name of Shakespeare or something, brother ...

527
00:45:12,436 --> 00:45:16,094
Lost your memory is good .. But this is not an argument ..

528
00:45:16,118 --> 00:45:19,903
Somebody did not pay no transaction .. .. ණයකුත්

529
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:23,482
You are very pretty .. you innocent.

00:45:23,506 --> 00:45:26,894
Do not do it .. so ..

531

00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:48,511

535
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,550
My colorful guest has arrived ..

536
00:45:55,574 --> 00:45:59,026
The boy jumps down to everyone ..

537
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,925
The boy had been a true visitor ..

538
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:19,361
The boy had been a true visitor ..

539
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,792
The boy had been a true visitor ..

540
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:37,764
I can understand your pain, brother.

541
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:40,486
But do not say openly hold hands.

542
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:45,175
Although beautiful red floor, it can be life threatening.

543
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:50,889
Brother, do not hurt you.

544
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,436
Go. We now.

545
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:08,300
You're here, whose corpse someone else right hand grips,

546
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,839
No one else do not think you come here, come on ...

547
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:13,545
It's a real place.

548
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,918
There are very nice. And pretty.

549
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:20,758
Everyone was willing to take me home, take my hand.

550
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,496
I've got many girls had a decent peace of mind.

551
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,607
පුල්ගඩියා.

552
00:47:27,265 --> 00:47:28,980
පුල්ගඩියා, she did not take a honeymoon room.

553
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:20,392
පුල්ගඩියා a patient was sitting.

554
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:21,765
In the meantime, I ..

555
00:48:21,804 --> 00:48:23,272
Over six hours ...

556
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:25,788
Took her to draw on in my body.

557
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,867
Progress of ... health ... X / J

558
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:31,525
I took everything that had pulled her inside.

559
00:48:42,317 --> 00:48:43,761
The first path, useless Echo ..

560
00:48:45,396 --> 00:48:47,070
Were you in love before the start ...?

561
00:48:52,717 --> 00:48:53,717
Too.

562
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,226
Where are you ..?

563
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:03,588
I came from very far away.

564
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:07,818
You have not heard the name, I stay at.

565
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:10,238
But if we talk about how we talk.

566
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:12,508
Just what you have learned is ..

567
00:49:13,175 --> 00:49:15,738
I spoke to his sister.

568
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:19,920
Hey .. your mother, sister glitch .. .. going to go from here.

569
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,069
Brother ..

570
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,894
Brother .. brother up.

571
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:27,782
Get brother.

572
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:29,901
Brother.

573
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:33,139
You're talking brother.

574
00:49:33,718 --> 00:49:35,258
I want to help your brother.

575
00:49:35,282 --> 00:49:37,797
What did මායාවක්ද b .. පුල්ගඩියා?

576
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:39,536
Go with me now.

577
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,425
This memory has a direct connection to something.

578
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,449
The point is to tell the doctor's brother.

579
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:47,822
Boil the mixture .. pill cure.

580
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:51,250
There is a very important job. Brother .. we'll go.

581
00:49:58,486 --> 00:50:01,510
Stop here. Stop here.

582
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,375
Brother ..

583
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,676
This guy right here is my Marley was down.

584
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:12,612
I want .. I Male to Male.

585
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,041
It's very worth it? - Very much.

586
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:17,850
Listen brother.

587
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:21,230
The thief is in our own interest. But the message must Male Delhi.

588
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:24,396
Because it is so precious caught selling the chain neat.

589
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:28,816
So I go there, brother. - Where?

590
00:50:30,347 --> 00:50:31,347
Delhi.

591
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,117
This one .. - .. why?

592
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:59,236
My remote control has been stolen.

593
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:03,871
Sven's b .. The two of their remote control to find the police who are b ..

594
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,696
It's not a TV remote control.

595
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,370
So of what? - I can not say that.

596
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:12,774
But it was fenced fixed elevation hanging neck. And it's worth much more.

597
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:15,901
Where did the theft .. - Neat as well.

598
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:18,663
She ...? One of the neat stolen ..

599
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:20,996
They come to Delhi to find b ..

600
00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:23,956
But Delhi thief far. - So?

601
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:26,622
So where can you find cheats, then?

602
00:51:26,757 --> 00:51:28,472
There are two million people in this city .. weird.

603
00:51:28,622 --> 00:51:31,043
Police are men. Not without gods.

604
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:37,978
Only God can help you.

605
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:43,327
God hold two legs. Him means the only people able to help you.

606
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:48,469
Oh do know is how we know?

607
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,293
Oh know, here මකබෑවෙනවකෝ.

608
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,364
Have faith in the Son of God.

609
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,315
Who is god? I can say to help.

610
00:52:01,648 --> 00:52:03,672
-Yes, He is asking questions and not recite ..

611
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,989
After what I saw, I was freaked out.

612
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,743
Those who know this world

613
00:52:09,768 --> 00:52:11,807
Who made them ...

614
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:14,251
They themselves made them one place to be.

615
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:16,544
At least there are street street to his house.

616
00:52:16,924 --> 00:52:19,614
Hundreds of thousands of people to their questions before he goes ..

617
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:23,130
He took everyone's problems and a small amount of solution.

618
00:52:23,606 --> 00:52:26,638
He did not have this kind of a wonder of the world.

619
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:31,257
I could not believe you. Just thought I tried two or three times.

620
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:35,971
Let me know god.

621
00:52:36,455 --> 00:52:39,875
20 .. 50 .. This is what this .. and worthy to it .. 100 500 .. Then it

622
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:43,795
What is the difference between the 20 to 50 drilling drilling?

623
00:52:44,017 --> 00:52:48,430
- The size of the difference is no difference .. else. - And the 20's work is so deceptive ..

624
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:53,223
15 to Rs.

625
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,584
Lord, I am very hungry.

626
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:10,806
Give me something to eat.

627
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,375
I can not imagine anything happened.

628
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:27,097
The program argued that god.

629
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,311
Now I can go to my home.

630
00:53:30,802 --> 00:53:32,501
I took a good remote.

631
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:34,969
I brought it back දෙන්නකෝ. I want to go home.

632
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,601
Know, this is it down to God battery.

633
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,244
It does not work then we went to a little work.

634
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:57,569
What do you mean ..? - I mean, to put a new battery put කොතෙන්ටද ...?

635
00:53:57,593 --> 00:54:00,767
Do not put the battery call. - Then why this does not work ..?

636
00:54:01,203 --> 00:54:04,537
Where this kind of damage happened. - I'm not going to do it no harm happened to work.

637
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,401
You're the God created ..?

638
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:10,234
Yes, from my hands.

639
00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:14,138
God did not create you did God create you?

640
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:16,900
God created us all is that?

641
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:19,154
His sculptures we make it.

642
00:54:19,844 --> 00:54:21,598
Why create his sculptures?

643
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,241
And we can offer to hold Him.

644
00:54:23,804 --> 00:54:25,495
Tell Him about our joys and sorrows.

645
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:28,034
There have been installed communication device?

646
00:54:28,446 --> 00:54:30,558
How do we hear God say?

647
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:33,740
God does not need communication.

648
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:35,811
Hear Him directly.

649
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:38,692
If you hear directly what the sculpture?

650
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:41,811
I do not understand what the man.

651

What is Your problem?

653

654
00:54:51,396 --> 00:54:52,960

B .. not a good head? - What does that mean?

656
00:54:55,412 --> 00:54:58,592
Little to someone that you bear all know.

657
00:54:58,617 --> 00:55:01,339
Thief Leaves can do the little legs ..?

658
00:55:01,363 --> 00:55:04,593
Go inside temple. There was a big God.

Catch his bare feet. Run very fast.

662
00:55:18,424 --> 00:55:20,574
Everyone was waiting for their turn carrying swords and money.

663
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,407
To their work.

664
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:25,542
Two hours later, there was my turn.

665
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:27,566
Oh my god .. ..

666

How do huh? What money we paid, a mental hospital would go over, huh?

677
00:56:06,442 --> 00:56:09,132
The man was pulled down. So give me the bill mean.

Anyone wearing going.

00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:32,186
You two will be wearing somebody else.

683
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:34,440
The temples are you doing anyway.

684
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:52,858
අයකරගත්තා full fees. But I did not have work.

685

Divinity (God) - say the full name.

687
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,380
Do not know the full name.

688
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,396
Where you live?

689
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,062
That's in front of the temples.

690
00:57:08,649 --> 00:57:10,435
You gave her the money repaid?

691
00:57:10,697 --> 00:57:12,332
No, put his charity box.

He'll say that your job? - He does not speak.

00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:17,466
That's because ..? ගොළුවෙක්ද? - May be ...

Absolutely. - Right?

00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:23,363
Tell her appearance.

696
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:28,417
This looks like.

697
00:57:31,028 --> 00:57:32,266
But size is too large.

698
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:35,750
Come here Come here ... ..

699

Incomplete, so why drink to forget their difficulties?

706
00:58:06,373 --> 00:58:10,342
Muses a church temple.

707
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:12,889
Go to your church.

708
00:58:13,508 --> 00:58:15,341
Your God is near.

709
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:18,317

Beat it. Going out.

00:59:12,377 --> 00:59:16,694
Their sins because God put කුරුසෙට nailed.

713
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,869
කුරුසෙට nailed leave.

714
00:59:19,401 --> 00:59:22,131
When? - 2000 years ago.

715
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:23,686
For their sins.

716
00:59:24,368 --> 00:59:27,170
I think I deserve this? I came here alone.

717
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,106
They're drunk b ..

718
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:34,169
Yup. - God is watching. You're looking at how he behaves.

719
00:59:34,645 --> 00:59:37,335
Where are? Where are? Where?

What does that cup? - Wine.

721
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:42,779
Wine ...

722
00:59:43,366 --> 00:59:45,707
At that time, he took me to understand the thing.

723
00:59:46,342 --> 00:59:48,754
Coconut water has been God ..

724
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:51,111
Now he's having fun with wine.

725
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:52,579
I can give wine.

726
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:55,309
So I started to collect money.

727
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,205
Found that some of the money from the car dance.

728
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:01,594
Found some more,

729
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:04,459

731
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:31,955
Conductor, the storing of God itself matter? Yup. That is not forward.

732
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:53,649
Hold on.

733
01:00:54,744 --> 01:00:56,649
ඕවායේ what happened? - Wine.

734
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:59,046
Give God. Where is?

735
01:01:40,252 --> 01:01:42,259
This lady is very sad like.

736
01:01:42,917 --> 01:01:45,108
So I thought to know that the hand hold.

737
01:01:46,084 --> 01:01:48,401
A thing that someone hurt women widowed Asshole.

738
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:52,361
How do you know this guy who I'm a widow. - You've seen wearing a white saree b ..

739
01:02:04,978 --> 01:02:07,660

740
01:02:12,502 --> 01:02:16,303
Very sorry about the death of your husband. - What? When?

741
01:02:16,826 --> 01:02:19,930
How do I know when dead? You're wearing a white light.

742
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:24,700
Married to wear white matter. - No. මැරුණමයි wear white.

743
01:02:24,938 --> 01:02:27,597
Dirge to wear black. මූසලයෝ. - Now you understand. Get out of here.

744
01:02:39,744 --> 01:02:42,149

745
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:44,760
I'm coming here to live. You will ..

746
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,307
After eating, I understood why a lot of hurt,

747
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,243
One of the world is not

748
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,925
God, that many people.

749
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:54,385
Each is different and one way is legal wavered.

750
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:57,282
Is open to all companies that own god.

751
01:02:57,726 --> 01:02:59,694
It is known that people doctrine.

752
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,662
There are separate briefings every manager ධර්මයකටම.

753
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:06,424
Everyone in this world to be, something one of nature ..

754
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:08,543
The company is one belongs.

755
01:03:08,924 --> 01:03:13,273
It's God who is pursuing his own, not those of others.

756
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:15,860
I'm a member of what is now owned company?

757
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,899
Lord, how I hold sacred?

758
01:03:18,383 --> 01:03:21,430
If you want to know about the remote control.

759
01:03:36,898 --> 01:03:38,692
What are you doing?

760

762
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,713
That religion is marked.

763
01:03:45,831 --> 01:03:47,879
How do you know what that company, owned this?

764
01:03:48,998 --> 01:03:50,561
God, where does it run?

765
01:03:52,021 --> 01:03:53,219
Guards.

766
01:04:00,543 --> 01:04:03,003
It's getting hard to find out what happened to my religion.

767
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:05,423
Now you can do the same thing?

768
01:04:06,105 --> 01:04:08,296
I hold sacred gods every governor ධර්මයකටම.

769
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:11,066
One of them will be right, my God.

01:08:59,865 --> 01:09:00,865
Oh ..

813
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:06,301
I'm asking you, begging Him ..

814
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:11,277
I knelt down on his forehead revamped site will tell ..

815
01:09:14,475 --> 01:09:16,133
ඝන්ටාරය sounds to you ඇහැරවන්නද,

816
01:09:16,926 --> 01:09:18,490
If you call the loudspeaker,

817
01:09:20,013 --> 01:09:21,299
Gita ශ්ලෝක read ..

818
01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:22,648
If the Koran is right ..

819
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:24,029
Bible and read ..

820
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:27,513
You were one kind of Managers,

821
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,108
What is one to say ..

822
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:32,797
Says he sacrifices Monday ..

823
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:34,495
Another says he sacrifices Tuesday ..

824
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:37,757
Before I get to say the sun is food.

825
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,161
Then another man waded into the sun so do you.

826
01:09:41,153 --> 01:09:43,137
Says he offered to hold cattle ..

827
01:09:43,534 --> 01:09:45,129
Another person was killed, I tell them ..

828
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:49,549
Shoes go without saying a temple, another says to go to church wearing boots ..

829
01:09:51,905 --> 01:09:54,025
This is Eve කෝවද right කෝවද wrong.

830
01:09:54,874 --> 01:09:55,874
I do not understand anything.

831
01:09:58,906 --> 01:10:00,461
Then the Lord came here probably.

832
01:10:03,889 --> 01:10:04,889
I want to go home.

833
01:10:06,738 --> 01:10:07,992
I do want to say is you.

834
01:10:09,063 --> 01:10:10,214

836
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:15,490
What to tell.

837
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:18,601
If someone is hiding

838
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:21,196
Something answer.

839
01:10:22,394 --> 01:10:23,394

Who are you? - Do not recognize me?

I'm not a world, far from the world you come from.

857
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:26,622
This way you. Do you find my remote control? Then I can go home. You see.

858
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:28,209
Oh brother .. I go beating.

01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:31,336
I have small children. - I know.

861
01:12:34,122 --> 01:12:38,344
They can live alone. My remote control and also to find out where to go.

862
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:40,732
Lord save me.

863
01:12:41,184 --> 01:12:43,009
B .. god who are above you?

864
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:45,010
Where is ..?

865
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:50,089
Now that the Shiva dancing.

866
01:12:50,732 --> 01:12:54,597
No fear. - බේරගනියෝ me.

867
01:13:04,216 --> 01:13:06,240
බේරගනියෝ.

868
01:13:07,914 --> 01:13:09,040
බේරගනියෝ.

869
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:54,788
I Himalayas and mountains ..

870
01:13:55,772 --> 01:13:57,645
Remembering that God was ධ්යානගතවයි.

871
01:13:58,645 --> 01:14:00,557
Suddenly a light.

872
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:03,795
Great light of nowhere.

873
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:10,056
The light was raised, a small pointed down to earth.

874
01:14:10,961 --> 01:14:12,349
I looked at it.

875
01:14:13,055 --> 01:14:15,095
Remember that God is about.

876
01:14:15,547 --> 01:14:18,166
It quickly became a relationship.

877
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:21,610
God. Come to me.

878
01:14:21,634 --> 01:14:23,975
What is light?

879
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:27,300
The cold winter කඳුරකරයෙත් Heating feel makes plenty.

880
01:14:27,951 --> 01:14:29,998
God said.

881
01:14:30,585 --> 01:14:35,672
The god Shiva, drum break down priceless. This will bring.

882
01:14:36,323 --> 01:14:40,013
It had taken appropriate to this shrine built there.

883
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,322
This is only appearance devotees,

884
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:47,988
All that pain out of.

885
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,090
Do you see it?

886
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:57,106
Shiva drum break down the part.

887
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:04,581
Bola Bola බෝලෝ බම් බම්.

894
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:43,148
Where are you God?

895
01:15:43,528 --> 01:15:46,894
Come on stage. I want to thank you Lord.

896
01:15:47,933 --> 01:15:49,322
He is here.

897
01:15:49,932 --> 01:15:54,012
I met Him toilet. My request for a product, run ago.

898
01:15:54,828 --> 01:15:56,678
But I thought, I'll run.

899
01:15:56,797 --> 01:16:00,487
But it is not, he took me back here.

900
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:03,082
My product goes, thank God, whether .. Thank God, whether ..

901
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:05,986
This is not a piece of Shiva displease God,

902
01:16:06,264 --> 01:16:09,240
This one belongs to me. Accidentally sent optimistic.

903
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,414
Doubtful that displease have a piece of someone else.

904
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:16,207
Just ask him. Near the පාතම. If god came forward.

905
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:21,594
All right, I'll take it.

906
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:25,926
Oh .. I know it belongs.

907
01:16:44,946 --> 01:16:48,398
Travelers dreaming ..

Since when did you feel, you're someone else came to planet?

916
01:17:39,758 --> 01:17:40,758
Listen ..

917
01:17:41,296 --> 01:17:45,662
You had a mental doctor ගැහුනොත් met.

918
01:17:46,947 --> 01:17:47,947
Now go ma'am.

919
01:17:48,312 --> 01:17:50,329
500 is able to give so much punishment. Wait a minute.

920
01:17:57,963 --> 01:17:58,963
This is my card.

921
01:17:59,878 --> 01:18:01,942
Enlistments have written my number.

922
01:18:02,163 --> 01:18:04,726
If you like, I can prepare you for a session.

Do you think my story is not a lie.

When you have time off, I did.

935
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,599
Do not say. - How do you know.

936
01:18:56,955 --> 01:18:58,440
When you got my hand.

937
01:18:58,892 --> 01:19:01,661
When he met someone who said you can shake me.

938

You were thinking, if this story went awry. My destiny is left is issued it.

939

Do not lie. I have to tell you about it. Tell the truth.

I'm not okay to lie නොනේ. Lying mouth.

941
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:15,556
Our world is so attracted to men holding hands ..

942
01:19:17,539 --> 01:19:18,546
Where to hand. - I can not.

943
01:19:19,086 --> 01:19:20,086
Where දෙන්නකෝ.

944
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:23,095
Boy, I need help. I swallowed hard enough.

945
01:19:23,126 --> 01:19:26,714
Ask 1,000 people who are hospitalized for drugs.

946
01:19:27,452 --> 01:19:28,626
Another Rs. 500 is not enough ...

947
01:19:29,149 --> 01:19:32,324
If you can give 500 children, නෝනගේ my life ... - I'll. I'll.

948
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:37,879

01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,957
Thanks son.

951
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,750
Uncle ..

952
01:19:45,559 --> 01:19:47,892
Keep to 100. Go give it a try as a tip.

953
01:19:50,622 --> 01:19:52,122
Boy, I'll come.

954
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:55,947
.. Saw AHMAzwar realized.

955
01:19:56,438 --> 01:19:57,899
You can not read anyone's mind.

956
01:19:58,264 --> 01:20:01,089
Do not you understand? A man took the money to fool you.

957
01:20:01,398 --> 01:20:04,374
There is no hospital in the nearby foothills. - I know.

958
01:20:04,929 --> 01:20:07,644
He and his wife take a meal to bring my five-star hotel.

959
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:09,929
Today, his wife of 75 th birthday.

960
01:20:09,953 --> 01:20:12,818
Everyone 75 years and his wife were not at a five-star hotel.

961
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:15,826
A little at least one month to collect their pension from that little figure is making.

962
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:18,318
Wife to bring ice cream, it has to pay more than the thought homey.

963
01:20:18,516 --> 01:20:22,032
The money is going to come here to mate නානකාමරේට.

964
01:20:22,452 --> 01:20:23,579
Do please feel anything ..

965
01:20:25,095 --> 01:20:27,761
නෝනේ our world do not lie.

966
01:20:29,356 --> 01:20:30,364
You would imagine that.

967
01:21:31,328 --> 01:21:33,733
Wait, wait, hold on.

968
01:21:34,137 --> 01:21:35,311
Give it your hand.

972
01:22:51,649 --> 01:22:54,807
You do not tell anyone you know .. you පිටසක්වළයෙක්.

973
01:22:55,473 --> 01:22:57,418
If I said I was in a laboratory put out.

974
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,878
Dalrymple's what's inside our බලාවි cut.

975
01:23:01,877 --> 01:23:03,948
So why did I do?

976
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:09,416
On this one, I came from, everyone just took the money from me.

977
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:11,082
None of the money was not given.

978
01:23:11,336 --> 01:23:14,447
You're the first one I put in the box for charity in 5000.

979
01:23:15,486 --> 01:23:18,264
I felt inside, and I can not believe you're someone important.

980
01:23:22,382 --> 01:23:24,049
I will find your remote control, PK

981
01:23:26,049 --> 01:23:27,049
How's that?

982
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,094
This time do not tell.

983
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:31,816
But you must go back to your house.

984
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:33,387
That I promise you.

985
01:24:21,588 --> 01:24:22,762
What will you like ඔරව ඔරව ..

01:24:23,849 --> 01:24:24,849
At you.

987
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:27,499
පිටසක්වළයින් not come to my house every day.

988
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:33,903
Really .. it's your world, you hear everyone out of the way .. Which is?

989
01:24:36,426 --> 01:24:40,156
The same. - Then there all walks nude.

990
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:41,875
Do not feel strange?

991
01:24:43,153 --> 01:24:44,327
That music and naked.

992
01:24:45,374 --> 01:24:46,374
It feel strange?

993
01:24:47,176 --> 01:24:49,382
If'd wear looks strange.

994
01:24:52,357 --> 01:24:53,357
PK

995
01:24:54,008 --> 01:24:55,008
I did not sleep at night until lights.

996
01:24:56,277 --> 01:24:59,143
How do you get a remote control තාපසතුමන්ගෙන් was thinking about that.

997
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:04,317
Hello. - Connect බුල්වීර්සිංව. Room No. 4

998
01:25:04,428 --> 01:25:05,428
Wrong number.

999
01:25:06,054 --> 01:25:07,800
Is not this ෆෝටීස් hospital?

1000
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:10,786
Husband, you get a wrong number, you say I'm from yesterday.

1001
01:25:11,135 --> 01:25:14,762
How did the wrong number? I have stored phone number.

1002
01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:17,730
Okay, so what did?

1003
01:25:22,015 --> 01:25:24,737
Hello. - Connect බුල්වීර්සිංව. Room No. 4

1004
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:27,721
Oh .. you said you'm late.

1005
01:25:27,871 --> 01:25:29,856
බල්වීර් Singh died this morning. - What do you mean ..?

1006
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,745
How did the surgery haemorrhage die?

1007
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:37,522
That sad fact is. But that does not matter.

1008
01:25:37,681 --> 01:25:41,609
Let's write a death certificate, a heart that. Not on a family name to be ugly.

1009
01:25:42,308 --> 01:25:44,529
So come on, OK, take the body.

1010
01:25:44,632 --> 01:25:46,291
Oh .... - right there, then bye.

1011
01:25:49,314 --> 01:25:52,274
Why do you say? Happy people.

1012
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:56,694
Now he'll hospital. He saw how well their parents feel happy friend

1013
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:01,939
His little fun lesser offenses since it?

1014
01:26:02,596 --> 01:26:05,906
Fun ..? - PK I was joking?

1015
01:26:15,388 --> 01:26:18,721
I understood. I saw the whole game. They're kidding.

1016
01:26:19,077 --> 01:26:21,602
තාපසතුමන් hard and call God,

1017
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:24,610
This kind of head still is, God would appear.

1018
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:27,078
All of it going wrong number.

1019
01:26:28,133 --> 01:26:30,538
A person who answered the call Him kidding.

1020
01:26:30,973 --> 01:26:34,941
Or how God, my remote control Laminating with his broken Drums existence itself?

1021
01:26:36,663 --> 01:26:37,845
Looks to me ..

1022
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:43,059
Those who speak of God in this world with the telecommunications network, mess up.

1023
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,257
Every call going the wrong number.

1024
01:26:46,097 --> 01:26:48,137
- What do you mean? - I always thought ..

1025
01:26:48,938 --> 01:26:51,668
Why do not fit into God's answer to our questions.

1026
01:26:52,414 --> 01:26:56,517
Mourning scroll down to come to my house to give it says.

1027
01:26:56,818 --> 01:26:58,850
Tell me. We are all children of God, right?

1028
01:26:59,358 --> 01:27:02,112
So what dad, tell their children ..

1029
01:27:02,357 --> 01:27:04,374
Scroll down everything will be fine if you give.

1030
01:27:05,175 --> 01:27:09,302
Have it your dad ever? Scroll down if you get my daughter to have a new outfit that she attends.

1031
01:27:10,817 --> 01:27:15,087
I do not always mommy milk.

1032
01:27:15,976 --> 01:27:20,380
The calls go to PK or lesser God

1033
01:27:21,085 --> 01:27:22,967
He is what process?

1034
01:27:23,109 --> 01:27:27,117
What is he? Say, every day millions of children are on the road in my sleep.

1035
01:27:27,363 --> 01:27:30,506
Let them drink milk. I am not from me mommy milk.

1036
01:27:30,982 --> 01:27:34,506
I'm sure someone who took us fun. Now that you like.

1037
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:37,760
PK guy I thought was important lifestyle.

1038
01:27:38,062 --> 01:27:39,950
I did not have this issue to untie his head.

1039
01:27:40,305 --> 01:27:43,115
What would be a good idea came to my head.

1040
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:46,273
PK's remote control back to a better kind of idea.

1041
01:27:48,169 --> 01:27:51,630
Who is the PK? - Who? Where is home? It does not do anything.

1042
01:27:52,097 --> 01:27:54,463
But he can not see anyone as we see in this world.

1043
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:56,526
What does that mean? - Means ..

1044
01:27:57,049 --> 01:28:01,105
You see, he smokes, police spoke to say, you're trying to දිවිනහගන්න

1045
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,843
What is it? - Pack has more hit one, that smoking is cancer.

1046
01:28:06,843 --> 01:28:08,009
What do you think?

1047
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:11,484
War.

1048
01:28:12,301 --> 01:28:14,881
I would like to face the joys of PK with තාපසතුමන්.

1049
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,826
They want to talk about the other show on television.

1050
01:28:18,777 --> 01:28:20,864
Evaluation is looking more ඉන්ඳැද්දී values.

1051
01:28:21,832 --> 01:28:24,268
Clenching already back to my right side, there are three signs.

1052
01:28:25,085 --> 01:28:27,903
But it has brought you to the left, both sides are balanced, what?

1053
01:28:28,077 --> 01:28:32,355
No Jerry, what's most important in this war is not fought with PK තාපසතුමන්.

1054
01:28:32,657 --> 01:28:37,752
He will explain to him in love, he does not go to God's call that number is incorrect.

1055
01:28:38,204 --> 01:28:40,299
තාපසතුමන්ට can not imagine how we want to deal with is the PK.

1056
01:28:41,505 --> 01:28:43,442
Jerry, Jerry.

1057
01:28:44,164 --> 01:28:45,846
That are sitting out there. See once met.

1058
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:50,274
I challenge you, you will not answer his questions. Trust me.

1059
01:29:01,612 --> 01:29:04,786
Know, this is your hand down. - Oh, thank you.

1060
01:29:07,974 --> 01:29:10,641
This is not mine.

1061
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:14,125
කාමසූත්ර ස්ට්රොබෙරි taste.

1062
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:21,633
I'm sick of strawberries, ask me? අහනවකෝ others.

1063
01:29:24,308 --> 01:29:26,387
Madam, this is yours? - What do you unsuccessful?

1064
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:30,061
Just check your wallet. Do not lose the mall. Who are they, shoving one.

1065
01:29:31,782 --> 01:29:34,853
Uncle, this is yours, then? - No, I was not.

1066
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:36,743
PK It has done.

1067
01:29:37,068 --> 01:29:40,433
It's come to ask anything about her.

1068
01:29:42,075 --> 01:29:43,075
Come in.

1069
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:46,797
What is this?

1070
01:29:48,296 --> 01:29:49,336
Give condoms.

1071
01:29:50,152 --> 01:29:53,479
What is this? - Blows are controlled population.

1072
01:29:55,534 --> 01:29:58,343
How's that? - There it is dressed.

1073
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:01,049
Add up with someone else sexually cases.

1074
01:30:03,825 --> 01:30:06,713
How are you this ඇඳගත්තම world population is?

1075
01:30:06,913 --> 01:30:08,435
I'm not ඇඳගත්තාම.

1076
01:30:08,978 --> 01:30:12,014
Millions of people wear those things. - All these and get yours?

1077
01:30:12,903 --> 01:30:14,014
Everybody's got those things.

1078
01:30:14,703 --> 01:30:17,942
I have this problem. Listen, PK, to ask a question.

1079
01:30:18,815 --> 01:30:23,013
Money from the pockets of the people fall down, they all take it in my rush to do it my.

1080
01:30:23,203 --> 01:30:28,092
But you're in all cases උපත්පාලන mine that I was not afraid to run.

1081
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,472
This is, adding that sex is a private matter.

1082
01:30:32,836 --> 01:30:35,654
What is it? -'ve Entered the world just do not want to say, today I am going to have sex together.

1083
01:30:37,003 --> 01:30:38,439
But then married ..

1084
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:41,407
Crackers made, the orchestra players to teams ..

1085
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:45,415
Why is everybody city, today I going to have sex together.

1086
01:30:48,978 --> 01:30:49,978
What's this?

1087
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:53,112
I do not have an answer to your question.

1088
01:30:53,611 --> 01:30:55,476
But I have a job for you near.

We go in, give ear to listen to his phone calls.

1094
01:31:22,509 --> 01:31:25,675
You start to do something even if the other side, you have to be submitted soon.

1095
01:31:26,127 --> 01:31:28,937
It has to realize that his phone calls තාපසතුමන්ට going the wrong number.

1096
01:31:29,396 --> 01:31:30,856
That would be obliterated, he returned my remote control?

01:33:13,593 --> 01:33:15,037
What is?

1123

I understand that we all God's children, right?

1129
01:33:35,097 --> 01:33:39,954
So yes. - So, what do you get your child to you for your help ?.

God does not see a spurt received until now no ordinary mud.

1148
01:35:05,488 --> 01:35:06,948
God does what we expect ..

01:35:07,352 --> 01:35:09,003
We say, God Manager.

1159
01:35:52,131 --> 01:35:54,100
PK says not to build the temple.

1160
01:35:54,131 --> 01:35:57,591
The gem that belongs to him to tell. - What is in your pocket?

Dad, this is nonsense, if I stop the program.

This is the factory machine.

01:41:48,137 --> 01:41:49,558
So initially invested.

1239
01:41:54,454 --> 01:41:57,049
Now officially start.

1240
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:10,760
Now wait. 15 minutes to double investments.

1241
01:42:17,783 --> 01:42:18,870
Look. Look.

1242
01:42:20,988 --> 01:42:22,354
He was arrested.

Hot hot tea. - Look man selling tea,

1244
01:42:28,756 --> 01:42:33,430
How invested. Green tea, sugar, water, glass, anything.

01:42:33,659 --> 01:42:36,644
There is ගලකුයි red, green තිලකයකුයි.

1246
01:42:37,706 --> 01:42:39,190
Hot tea, hot tea.

1247
01:42:39,388 --> 01:42:41,333
There are customers out there who could bring that guy.

1248
01:42:42,078 --> 01:42:44,436
And there, consumers are unable to එලවගන්න.

1249
01:42:44,927 --> 01:42:48,879
Alright, come on. You'll have the rest of the pilgrims.

There will bow down in front of the customer.

1251
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:57,005
Here the customer in front of the stone, washed down shakes.

More people got scared ගාගෙනම belly shakes.

1253
01:43:04,336 --> 01:43:08,439
The business man speaking lesser offenses. Afraid to do business.

1254
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:12,010
Afraid of going to the temple of gaining one.

1255
01:43:12,843 --> 01:43:15,883
You're pretty scared. These are removed from it.

1256
01:43:17,141 --> 01:43:19,467
Not a question about religion.

1257
01:43:20,173 --> 01:43:21,641
It's something to believe in.

1258
01:43:22,546 --> 01:43:24,950
God does not like people questioning ..

1259
01:43:25,322 --> 01:43:29,259
He argued that we do not allow you to ask why.

1260
01:43:29,783 --> 01:43:33,187
The use of resources, the buyers, attacked and could not answer.

1261
01:43:33,814 --> 01:43:37,512
Afraid to, mouths shut. Still, we do not shut up.

1262
01:43:38,099 --> 01:43:42,147
Until now the only one who questioned the PK, PK from today, thousands of questions will light.

1263
01:43:43,163 --> 01:43:45,742
So guys, .. take up their phones

What is to aid us? Answer.

1273

Om writes. Om writes.

1274
01:44:28,813 --> 01:44:31,106
The wrong number. The wrong number.

01:57:31,056 --> 01:57:34,492
My plan worked, PK. Imagine that you have the remote control.

1434
01:57:40,237 --> 01:57:41,253
But ..

1435
01:57:42,142 --> 01:57:43,610
If you go here.

1436
01:57:45,808 --> 01:57:46,808
Gonna go ..

1437
01:57:48,490 --> 01:57:49,863
Never owned one impressed.

1438
01:57:52,808 --> 01:57:55,022
A missing friend ..

1439
01:57:57,093 --> 01:57:58,982
I would remind you, too.

1440
01:58:01,838 --> 01:58:02,838
Stop?

1441
01:58:06,599 --> 01:58:08,456
How it stop?

1442
01:58:09,987 --> 01:58:10,995
I really say.

1443
01:58:11,836 --> 01:58:15,376
Has more work. Others can share everything.

1444
01:58:15,654 --> 01:58:16,733
You can stay here.

1445
01:58:17,391 --> 01:58:21,495
If someone wants to pay me a time to meet ගැහේවිනේ.

1446
01:58:22,241 --> 01:58:23,947
To marry him. I do not ask ..?

1447
01:58:24,907 --> 01:58:26,439
Who can I marry you?

1448
01:58:27,264 --> 01:58:28,629
Why is that?

1449
01:58:29,216 --> 01:58:31,756
Your trouble is starved to introduce you to go.

1450
01:58:33,161 --> 01:58:35,153
This is my husband.

1451
01:58:35,305 --> 01:58:36,764
She's PK (Drunk)

1452
01:58:37,985 --> 01:58:41,137
That's not my name. Basically all I did. Ridiculous.

1453
01:58:41,161 --> 01:58:43,454
PK (Drunk ..) - I changed my name.

1454
01:58:45,176 --> 01:58:47,430
Something you name ...

1455
01:58:47,715 --> 01:58:49,438
Proposed testimony. To you ..

1456
01:58:50,255 --> 01:58:52,366
I feel ..හොඳයි name. - Look.

1457
01:58:52,937 --> 01:58:55,580
The person's name and his පෞර්ෂ්යත්වය ..

1458
01:58:56,127 --> 01:58:58,754
To fit. - Yes, he's right.

1459
01:58:59,444 --> 01:59:03,357
So .. how my පෞර්ෂ්යත්වය? - I have a little පෙන්නන්නම්කෝ.

1460
01:59:04,793 --> 01:59:06,849
I have හාත්රසී Kaka ..

1461
01:59:09,348 --> 01:59:12,308
The name and image, the difference ..

1462
01:59:12,332 --> 01:59:15,363
I do not want to hear poetry. Let me say something else.

1463
01:59:16,307 --> 01:59:18,870
The name and image, the difference ..

1464
01:59:18,894 --> 01:59:22,100
Damn. How do understand him?

1465
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:24,243
Got another name ..

1466
01:59:24,830 --> 01:59:26,369
Behave another way ..

1467
01:59:27,043 --> 01:59:30,519
Fire has completely cooled ..

1468
01:59:56,563 --> 02:00:00,539
Thank you very much're great .. There is a lot of work there is one.

1469
02:00:01,515 --> 02:00:04,626
You choose any name. If you have a good look inside.

1470
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:07,602
ඩන්ග්රූ ටට්ටේ Ram.

1471
02:00:08,848 --> 02:00:10,308
Indeed, no secrets.

1472
02:00:11,427 --> 02:00:14,149
Oh .. multinational Singh.

1473
02:00:16,236 --> 02:00:17,601
සර්ෆරාස්.

1474
02:00:24,076 --> 02:00:26,941
See, they are more good there.

1475
02:00:31,407 --> 02:00:32,462
Clenching What happened?

1476
02:00:33,763 --> 02:00:34,763
Nothing.

1477
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:44,929
How brother ..

1478
02:03:41,844 --> 02:03:45,082
One terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for the attack.

1479
02:03:45,955 --> 02:03:49,304
They say this is only one small attack.

1480
02:03:49,708 --> 02:03:52,597
This is what happens to those who attacked us.

1481
02:03:52,621 --> 02:03:55,343
We will defend our God.

1482
02:04:16,929 --> 02:04:17,938
Where PK?

1483
02:04:19,906 --> 02:04:23,159
Program. - No, do not want to go.

1484
02:04:25,929 --> 02:04:26,929
Must go.

1485
02:04:42,844 --> 02:04:44,486
"One more question."

1486
02:04:44,866 --> 02:04:48,113
This special program, all your welcome.

1487
02:04:48,232 --> 02:04:50,787
When you connect to the PK .. .. - Hold.

1488
02:04:50,978 --> 02:04:52,358
Wait a bit.

1489
02:04:57,785 --> 02:04:58,785
Where to.

1490
02:05:05,284 --> 02:05:06,315
What is this?

1491
02:05:07,346 --> 02:05:08,704
God is a ..

1492
02:05:09,394 --> 02:05:11,569
His drum break down a ..

1493
02:05:12,283 --> 02:05:13,339
Okay ..

1494
02:05:14,124 --> 02:05:15,148
It belongs to him.

1495
02:05:16,632 --> 02:05:18,219
God is ..

1496
02:05:19,013 --> 02:05:20,131
Temples to create.

1497
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:21,956
Okay ..

1498
02:05:22,844 --> 02:05:25,297
Temples to get it done. Mean that we are asking ..?

1499
02:05:26,646 --> 02:05:27,670
God .. that thing?

1500
02:05:28,542 --> 02:05:29,566
Or .. thing is this guy?

1501
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:34,072
Wearing a yellow helmet, the green Sudan.Even.

1502
02:05:34,936 --> 02:05:35,936
To see. To see.

1503
02:05:37,356 --> 02:05:38,380
Said first ..

1504
02:05:39,316 --> 02:05:40,657
God never find it.

1505
02:05:41,125 --> 02:05:42,760
Then he asked God a liar.

1506
02:05:43,347 --> 02:05:44,664
Tomorrow should say ..

1507
02:05:45,291 --> 02:05:46,394
God has died.

1508
02:05:48,592 --> 02:05:50,164
Boy, what do you expect?

1509
02:05:50,973 --> 02:05:54,188
I do not have a world of God?

1510
02:05:56,076 --> 02:05:57,076
To you ..

1511
02:05:57,695 --> 02:06:00,234
Understand people's feelings?

1512
02:06:01,185 --> 02:06:02,788
Some people do not eat bread.

1513
02:06:04,065 --> 02:06:05,700
Some head no roof.

1514
02:06:06,929 --> 02:06:09,270
People do not talk to a friend.

1515
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:13,547
How many lives that day නහගන්නවාද you know?

1516
02:06:14,063 --> 02:06:17,951
Buds take off. Fan hanging die.

1517
02:06:18,823 --> 02:06:21,054
Why is that? Because if they do not hope to live.

1518
02:06:21,633 --> 02:06:23,625
God came forward ..

1519
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:25,847
Tilak is kept forehead ..

1520
02:06:26,894 --> 02:06:29,442
ගැටගහගත්තාම hand thread ..

1521
02:06:29,466 --> 02:06:33,275
If we want to live in them, they do it ..

1522
02:06:33,569 --> 02:06:35,870
Who are you to seize?

1523
02:06:37,322 --> 02:06:38,322
And ..

1524
02:06:38,893 --> 02:06:42,036
The hard and tried to corrupt people say ..

1525
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:45,377
Instead, do what you tell them.

1526
02:06:46,266 --> 02:06:49,670
Every day you read this the wrong number .. .. wrong number.

1527
02:06:50,662 --> 02:06:55,074
We tell everyone, you tell me what the correct number.

1528
02:07:04,422 --> 02:07:06,471
Exactly what you say තාපසතුමනි.

1529
02:07:08,225 --> 02:07:09,431
At one time, was ..

1530
02:07:10,462 --> 02:07:13,161
I could not find food to eat.

1531
02:07:14,375 --> 02:07:15,716
I was not home.

1532
02:07:16,794 --> 02:07:18,049
I cried a lot.

1533
02:07:19,422 --> 02:07:21,231
I let this one coming, friends.

1534
02:07:23,254 --> 02:07:26,048
I only had one of ...

1535
02:07:28,927 --> 02:07:30,006
God ...

1536
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:34,180
I always thought that would be good tomorrow.

1537
02:07:35,283 --> 02:07:36,830
What is the right way to point to God.

1538
02:07:39,646 --> 02:07:40,663
I accept.

1539
02:07:41,972 --> 02:07:44,417
Faith in God that spending ..

1540
02:07:45,028 --> 02:07:46,393
Hope for the heart.

1541
02:07:48,115 --> 02:07:51,535
The difficulties that befell .. courageous, heart gives strength.

1542
02:07:53,328 --> 02:07:54,820
But I have one question.

1543
02:07:58,684 --> 02:08:00,437
I want to believe in God, and how.

1544
02:08:02,532 --> 02:08:04,992
You say that God'm drilling.

1545
02:08:06,865 --> 02:08:07,968
I do not say ..

1546
02:08:09,721 --> 02:08:10,721
There are two ..

1547
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,340
One was the one who created us all.

1548
02:08:16,657 --> 02:08:19,450
The other one is the one made by you.

1549
02:08:21,561 --> 02:08:24,434
We do not know anything about the man made us all.

1550
02:08:25,132 --> 02:08:26,759
But you're the one who made ..

1551
02:08:27,211 --> 02:08:29,092
You seem entirely.

1552
02:08:30,163 --> 02:08:32,258
Pretend play act,

1553
02:08:32,901 --> 02:08:34,083
Giving false promises.

1554
02:08:34,885 --> 02:08:36,416
Rich ones soon meet you there.

1555
02:08:37,415 --> 02:08:38,851
Letting the poor people there.

1556
02:08:39,256 --> 02:08:40,478
When praised happy.

1557
02:08:41,176 --> 02:08:42,430
People are afraid to even word for word.

1558
02:08:44,533 --> 02:08:46,454
I have the right number is very simple.

1559
02:08:48,334 --> 02:08:51,128
We are all made in God count ..

1560
02:08:51,818 --> 02:08:53,001
Put faith.

1561
02:08:54,683 --> 02:08:57,612
And you made that fake god ..

1562
02:08:58,905 --> 02:08:59,913
Get it done.

1563
02:09:03,301 --> 02:09:06,848
You hand, because our God ..

1564
02:09:07,681 --> 02:09:08,681
I'm gonna shut up and wait I think ..

1565
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:11,697
Boy, we know how to protect our God.

1566
02:09:11,721 --> 02:09:13,871
You can protect God ..?

1567
02:09:14,283 --> 02:09:15,347
You ..?

1568
02:09:16,665 --> 02:09:18,418
The world is very small.

1569
02:09:19,005 --> 02:09:21,648
In the world there is a big difference in the universe.

1570
02:09:22,045 --> 02:09:26,433
You're a little world, a little safer, a little street, so sit ..

1571
02:09:27,123 --> 02:09:30,020
I made Him to protect the universe ..

1572
02:09:31,773 --> 02:09:33,209
Him you do not care.

1573
02:09:34,804 --> 02:09:36,717
Him can protect themselves.

1574
02:09:40,303 --> 02:09:44,541
Today, one of my friends died because he tried to make his දෙවියන්වආරක්ෂා ...

1575
02:09:46,485 --> 02:09:48,271
I was just left her the shoe.

1576
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:52,398
Stop trying to defend God.

1577
02:09:52,811 --> 02:09:53,945
Or in the world ..

1578
02:09:54,501 --> 02:09:56,342
People will not only save up shoes.

1579
02:09:56,453 --> 02:09:58,318
One Muslim bomb blast ..

1580
02:09:59,763 --> 02:10:01,024
Hindu man ..

1581
02:10:01,548 --> 02:10:04,048
Sitting here asking your speech.

1582
02:10:05,413 --> 02:10:07,397
Well .. - Who's Who Hindu and Muslim ..

1583
02:10:08,127 --> 02:10:09,992
Where is marked show.

1584
02:10:11,690 --> 02:10:14,142
The difference was not like you were God.

1585
02:10:14,872 --> 02:10:15,919
And it is ..

1586
02:10:16,291 --> 02:10:18,855
The world's most dangerous, wrong number.

1587
02:10:19,299 --> 02:10:20,735
More than anything serious wrong number.

1588
02:10:21,013 --> 02:10:23,790
Most people would die. Apart from each other.

1589
02:10:24,242 --> 02:10:25,678
The wrong number, you ..

1590
02:10:25,948 --> 02:10:28,694
ජග්ගූගේ ඔළුටත් to enter, සර්ෆරාස්ව allocated to him.

1591
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:32,368
What hotline wrong? - සර්ෆරාස් to entice her ..

1592
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:34,717
Who said that Muslims are hypocrites ..

1593
02:10:34,876 --> 02:10:36,883
So .. he is deceived her.

1594
02:10:37,049 --> 02:10:39,097
It's not a lie.

1595
02:10:39,122 --> 02:10:40,558

02:22:22,525 --> 02:22:23,961
I was very දුවවව්වා.

1755
02:22:28,491 --> 02:22:30,928
PK has been recording what mom?

1756
02:22:32,872 --> 02:22:35,531
I mean, Kaputu noise, traffic congestion, noise and hear.

1757
02:22:48,053 --> 02:22:49,553
Earth seems sometimes ..

1758
02:22:50,434 --> 02:22:51,910
I listen to the piano.

1759
02:22:53,402 --> 02:22:57,084
From there, you waved his hand, said.

1760
02:22:57,813 --> 02:22:58,813
Fast ..

1761
02:23:01,113 --> 02:23:02,962
Cristina wave you hand ..

1762
02:23:04,049 --> 02:23:05,247
Get the time ..

1763
02:23:07,009 --> 02:23:08,429
Millicent has not on record my voice would not it?

1764
02:23:10,429 --> 02:23:11,913
Will see ...

1765
02:23:13,198 --> 02:23:14,198
B .. put him.

1766
02:23:14,857 --> 02:23:17,626
You say that rhyme, have it.

1767
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:21,118
It is the only poem?

1768
02:23:24,466 --> 02:23:26,386
I love කරනවායැ ..

1769
02:23:27,322 --> 02:23:28,965
I totally devoted to waste thinking about you ..

1770
02:23:49,296 --> 02:23:51,205
He did not back any one time.

1771
02:23:52,657 --> 02:23:54,348
Sometimes a glitch in his tears හංඟගන්න.

1772
02:23:55,975 --> 02:23:57,118
He did something about position ..

1773
02:23:58,133 --> 02:23:59,173
It also teaches something ..

1774
02:24:01,244 --> 02:24:02,744
Learned to lie.

1775
02:24:04,132 --> 02:24:05,291
Was taught ..

1776
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:07,791
Love is the word meaning.

1777
02:24:09,172 --> 02:24:11,664
"I would love to be able to go too."

1778
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:15,918
The world as children come ..

1779
02:24:16,838 --> 02:24:17,862
She is naked here today.

1780
02:24:19,409 --> 02:24:21,457
Like a lot of kids asking questions ..

1781
02:24:22,933 --> 02:24:24,750
Also asked a lot of questions.

1782
02:24:27,329 --> 02:24:28,575
Then one day ..

1783
02:24:31,789 --> 02:24:32,789
Go away.

1784
02:24:35,741 --> 02:24:38,638
We want them very far ..

1785
02:24:41,662 --> 02:24:44,185
The way I was given a very nice gift.

1786
02:24:47,502 --> 02:24:48,621
සර්ෆරාස්.

1787
02:24:50,765 --> 02:24:51,765
And my father.

1788
02:24:55,892 --> 02:24:57,312
පීවත් is long ..

1789
02:24:58,137 --> 02:24:59,931
He's in every night and look at the star ..

1790
02:25:01,225 --> 02:25:02,248
Waved his hand.

1791
02:25:05,017 --> 02:25:06,040
Sure ..

1792
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:08,008
It also makes.

1793
02:25:12,809 --> 02:25:13,904
I miss him.

1794
02:25:48,578 --> 02:25:52,872
After a year ...

1795
02:25:54,403 --> 02:25:58,475
We are brothers and sisters .. one hour disembark Earth.

1796
02:25:58,903 --> 02:26:02,712
Do not forget that I'm given. Have four points.

1797
02:26:03,116 --> 02:26:05,839
First, banned from walking naked on Earth.

1798
02:26:06,355 --> 02:26:08,648
They do u kiss මනං ..

1799
02:26:08,672 --> 02:26:11,656
Every one who is naked here හැංඟිලයි.

1800
02:26:11,798 --> 02:26:15,806
Trees that raise everything else is open.

1801
02:26:16,258 --> 02:26:19,774
Second, the big issue here is the language.

1802
02:26:20,021 --> 02:26:21,837
You would then ask කඩමණ්ඩියකදී,

1803
02:26:21,861 --> 02:26:23,646
I love chickens, fish .. I love you ..

1804
02:26:23,805 --> 02:26:27,249
Not much to say here, that means those animals.

1805
02:26:27,558 --> 02:26:32,138
It means that, today, the chickens eat, or one that will take fish.

1806
02:26:32,622 --> 02:26:37,225
They think about the difference between what we say and what research is.

1807
02:26:37,939 --> 02:26:41,209
Third, we need to collect clothes from the car down, quit walking and dancing.

1808
02:26:41,566 --> 02:26:44,748
You put everyone in their underwear kicked remote control.

1809
02:26:44,882 --> 02:26:48,613
Nobody steals failed to hit the nail.

1810
02:26:49,049 --> 02:26:52,081
Fourth, and most important point.

1811
02:26:52,596 --> 02:26:56,707
Needing to meet someone who can connect to God ගැහුනොත්,

1812
02:26:56,873 --> 02:27:01,207
Left side of the research, on the other side of the back, you can come back fast.

1813
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:16,490
Brothers go. Oh, do not worry.

1814
02:27:21,980 --> 02:27:23,686
What will keep ඔරව ඔරව huh?

1815
02:27:25,415 --> 02:27:27,733
I have a question. - What is?

1816
02:27:29,034 --> 02:27:30,153
When the time came before you,

1817
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:33,335
Were you how to eat cheeks roads?

1818
02:27:41,563 --> 02:27:43,610
Why these?

1819
02:27:44,919 --> 02:27:46,720
Self. B .. safety? - Yup.

1820
02:27:47,323 --> 02:27:48,799
Go. - Go.

1821
02:27:48,823 --> 02:27:51,315
Where are you going? මෙහේටයි go.

1822
02:27:51,823 --> 02:30:51,315
