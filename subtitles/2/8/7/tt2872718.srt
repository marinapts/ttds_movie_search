1
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,022
What are you doing out here?

2
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:08,390
I'm lost.

3
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,192
This is a restricted area.

4
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,727
Oh, I didn't know that.
There's no signs.

5
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:16,731
They're everywhere. Let's see some ID.

6
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:17,833
Why?

7
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,836
There's a broken gate back there,
and you're trespassing.

8
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:22,273
Excuse me, sir,

9
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:25,173
that gate was open and I was under
the opinion that this was a detour.

10
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:27,342
Let me see the ID. Take it out.

11
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:31,380
- What kind of uniform is that?
- I'll ask the fucking questions.

12
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,934
It's a private outfit, huh?

13
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:37,152
I tried to get one of those jobs.
I like guarding things.

14
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:38,685
Really?

15
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,023
Here you go, sir.
I think what must have happened

16
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:45,691
is I just must have
gotten turned around.

17
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:54,302
- <i>Is it in the high-end or the low-end range?</i>
- <i>Oh, there's no question it's up!</i>

18
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,673
- <i>Yes, but 20%?</i>
- <i>Foreclosure, foreclosure, foreclosure!</i>

19
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,609
<i>We're talking about over
two-thirds of the market,</i>

20
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:02,777
<i>and, of course,
it's linked to unemployment.</i>

21
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:06,148
<i>So, the opportunity for the average
investor with the right know-how...</i>

22
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:09,719
- <i>Is all in the book. In the seminars.</i>
- <i>Very little doubt?</i>

23
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:13,155
<i>Yes, their distress sales makes
them want them off the books.</i>

24
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:16,524
<i>They need to sell them.
They have to, right?</i>

25
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,196
<i>...you name it, we teach them all.</i>

26
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:24,633
I guesstimate that I have about
50 pounds of copper wire,

27
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,637
100 pounds of chain-link fence and two
manhole covers. The nice thick ones.

28
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:32,474
I'll give 50 cents a pound for the wire,
15 for the fence, and 10 for the covers.

29
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:35,677
- That's below market value.
- Market value?

30
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,613
You know the cops came by
asking about manhole covers?

31
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,650
I'd like to counter at a
dollar a pound for the copper,

32
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,487
30 cents a pound for the fence,
and 20 cents per for the covers.

33
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:49,124
- Sell them somewhere else.
- I'd feel good at 75, 25, and 15.

34
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:50,625
I'm not negotiating with you.

35
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,525
- I think we're close.
- I'm done.

36
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,937
I'm willing to take less to
establish a business relationship.

37
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:04,472
If that's your last best offer,
then I guess I accept.

38
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,305
All right. Drive around
back and unload them.

39
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:10,610
Excuse me, sir?

40
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,348
I'm looking for a job.

41
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:17,419
In fact, I've made up my mind to find a
career that I can learn and grow into.

42
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:20,322
Who am I? I'm a hard-worker,
I set high goals

43
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:23,825
and I've been told that I am persistent.
Now, I'm not fooling myself, sir.

44
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:26,695
Having been raised with the self-esteem
movement so popular in schools,

45
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:28,363
I used to expect my
needs to be considered.

46
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:31,386
But I know that today's work culture
no longer caters to the job loyalty

47
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:33,501
that could be promised
to earlier generations.

48
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:37,172
What I believe, sir, is that good things
come to those who work their asses off.

49
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:39,356
And that people such as yourself,
who reach the top of the mountain,

50
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:40,975
didn't just fall there.

51
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:44,613
My motto is if you wanna win the lottery,
you have to make the money to buy a ticket.

52
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,214
Did I say that I worked in a garage?

53
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:54,189
So, what do you say? I could start
tomorrow, or even why not tonight?

54
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,688
No.

55
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,367
How about an internship then?

56
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,637
A lot of young people are taking unpaid
positions to get a foot in the door.

57
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:10,638
That's something I'd be willing to do.

58
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,372
I'm not hiring a fucking thief.

59
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:47,776
This thing's gonna blow!

60
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:49,808
Crap! Gotta move!

61
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,147
Help!

62
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:05,093
This thing is not budging. Hold on.

63
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,794
I can't move!

64
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:20,973
Let's go. Let's go!

65
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,345
Let's go!

66
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,053
- We're first!
- No shit! Get a shot on the other side!

67
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:33,855
All right, all right.

68
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,723
Get a shot inside the car.

69
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,463
Go around. Get inside the car.
The fuck am I paying you for?

70
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:52,073
Yeah, it's free.

71
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:55,541
- Get back, Loder. Get back!
- I'm back, I'm back, I'm back!

72
00:07:57,245 --> 00:08:00,913
All units. EMS, just past exit 31.

73
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:21,936
Excuse me.

74
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:26,240
- Will this be on television?
- Morning news. If it bleeds, it leads.

75
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,911
- What channel?
- Whoever pays the most.

76
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:32,545
What do you get for something like this?

77
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,314
Not nearly enough.

78
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:41,890
Enough to buy all that gear.

79
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,991
Let me tell you something.
It's a flaming asshole of a job.

80
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:49,462
Can I ask you, are you currently hiring?

81
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,467
Fuck, no.

82
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:54,762
Well,

83
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,788

This is a custom racing bicycle, sir.
Designed for competitive road cycling.

121
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:11,599
This bike has a light-weight,
space-age carbon frame

and handlebars positioned to put the
rider in a more aerodynamic posture.

- It cost me over $8,000 new.
- $700.

127
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:31,083
- $2,500, and that's giving it away.
- No bike has got 37 gears.

128
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,821

129

00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:03,445
Blow, blow, blow, blow blow.
Almost. Almost.

150
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,714
Will you move that cam?
Man, you better back up.

151
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:08,316
Leave!

152
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,615
Do you think I'm playing with you?

153

seen northbound Western on foot.</i>

155
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:24,198
<i>Code Three, incident 4259. ID 703.</i>

156
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:48,155
All right, let's get some blood pressure.
He's pretty shocked.

157
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,557
Breathing is very shallow.

158
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,660
- He's got a second chest wound here.
- Put pressure on it.

159
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,961
We got it. Strap it on the other side.

160
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,329
- You got a dressing on it?
- Yeah.

161
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:59,233
- GCS is 1-1-1, guys.
- Give me pressure.

162
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,070
- 90 over 60.
- No radial pulse.

163
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,338
We're losing him.

164
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:06,438
- He's bleeding out.
- Can you bag him?

165
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:10,478
Let's start bagging him.
Keep on high flow, too.

166
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:11,980
Yep.

167
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,949
- I got no pulse here.
- Unresponsive.

168
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,318
Get back. You. Get back.

169
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,084
Get the fuck back now.

170
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,424
Okay. Shit. All right.

171
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,594
Get back, 100 feet back, now.

172
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:28,927
You get back, too. 100 feet.

173
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,999
Fucking asshole, you shut it down.

174
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,334
I had a great fucking angle back
there until you crowded in.

175
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:37,669
Get the fuck home. There's people trying
to do their fucking job. Fucking asshole.

176
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:43,611
Yeah. It's Ace Video. Your lead's
gonna be at First and Western.

177
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,714
Yeah, you wanna get there.
It's a shooting.

178
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:49,517
Yeah, I got some great footage
of a victim being treated.

179
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:53,035
No, the LAPD hasn't released it but a
manager at a Walgreens says it's a carjacking

180
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:57,291
and the victim is the owner.
He's Asian and critical. Right.

181
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:00,825
Look, I got a 60-second cut
with the manager and a neighbor.

182
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:05,366
$500. Then, make me a deal. $400.

183
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,799
$300. All right, deal.

184
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,057
Are you fucking kidding me?

185
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:13,998
Get out of here.

186
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,154
Okay, dip into graphics.

187
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:02,023
I don't think that's going to cover it.

188
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,155
Frank, it's not my call.

189
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,359
Oh, excuse me.

190
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:12,931
- Excuse me. I have video footage.
- Down the hall, to the right.

191
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:19,073
- Right here.
- Okay.

192
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:22,009
Put the neighbor here, and the kids
with their mother by the door.

193
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,945
- You can get it back from 2:16.
- Yeah.

194
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:27,181
Then I want to lay in some nat-sound.
Let's loop the neighbor's dog barking.

195
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,881
And then try taking the
crying kid from B-roll

196
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:32,486
- and dropping that in the background.
- Got it.

197
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:33,921
You my fill-in operator?

198
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:37,658
I don't think so. I'm Lou Bloom.
I have some footage for sale.

199
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:38,593
A stringer?

200
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:41,493
- What?
- Who do you work for?

201
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:45,700
At the moment, I work for myself.

202
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,036
Okay, see Frank out there,
the way you came.

203
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,670
- What's it timed to?
- 1:06.

204
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,306
What do you have?

205
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:59,180
Something I'm fairly certain
you'll be very excited about.

206
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,915
What is it?

207
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:04,018
It's a shooting. A man was shot.
Several times, in fact.

208
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:06,221
He's lying on the ground,
and he's bleeding on the ground.

209
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,722
I'd be surprised if
he survived, honestly.

210
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,723
- He was shot during a carjacking.
- Western and First?

211
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:15,763
- Yes, that's right.
- We're getting that from Ace.

212
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,065
I was there. I was much
closer to what happened.

213
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,334
Okay. Okay. Let's see it.

214
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:27,105
You can fast forward through this.

215
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,312
Keep going, keep going.

216
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:33,614
<i>Walk away, or I'll arrest you for...</i>

217
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:35,514
A minute-and-a-half in.

218
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:40,288
There.

219
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,921
- I got no pulse...
- Oh, fuck.

220
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,393
I need you to see something.

221
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,705
- Yeah?
- Lou Bloom.

222
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:01,408
Frank Kruse, our assignment editor.
Play it back.

223
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,510
<i>I got no pulse, here.</i>

224
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,185
That's the lead. I want to break it up
and do a wrap-around from the scene.

225
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,388
I want a walking stand-up,
teaser at five, repeat on the half

226
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,023
and I want the copy to
start with a warning.

227
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,158
You're going to show this?

228
00:19:17,258 --> 00:19:18,993
- With a warning.
- It's excessive.

229
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,961
We should have packages
like this every day.

230
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,965
- People are eating breakfast.
- And they'll talk about it at work.

231
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:26,467
Tie it in with the carjacking
last month in Glendale.

232
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,737
And the other one, the van in Palms.
When was that? In March?

233
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,439
- March, yeah.
- It's a carjacking crime wave.

234
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,128
That's the banner. Call the
victim's family, get a quote, mic it.

235
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:38,756
- You know what to do.
- Yeah.

236
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:40,715
How much?

237
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:42,850
I'm selling this
particular piece for $1,000.

238
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,686
Not even close. This late,
you have nowhere else to go.

239
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,688
And the quality's for shit.

240
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:49,957
I'll give you $250,
that's the most I'll do.

241
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,256
Now, let's get you paid.

242
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,437
Here you go. Buy yourself
some better equipment,

243
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:58,866
a directional mic,
and get interviews when you can.

244
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,469
- You have a good eye.
- Thank you.

245
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:04,138
I'm just beginning, so praise
from someone such as yourself,

246
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,006
well, you can imagine
that it means quite a lot.

247
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:10,511
I'll help in any way I can. And, of course,
you can help me by calling us first.

248
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:12,713
I want you to contact me
when you have something.

249
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:14,348
- Something like this.
- That's right.

250
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:15,950
Bloody.

251
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,020
Well, that's only part of it.
We like crime. Not all crime.

252
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,857
Carjacking in Compton, for example.
That isn't news, now is it?

253
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:29,263
We find our viewers are more interested
in urban crime creeping into the suburbs.

254
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:34,368
What that means is a victim, or victims,
preferably well-off and white,

255
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:37,338
injured at the hands of
the poor or a minority.

256
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:38,772
Just crime.

257
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:42,610
No. Accidents play. Cars,
busses, trains, planes. Fires.

258
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,542
But bloody.

259
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,181
Well, graphic.

260
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:50,184
The best and clearest way
that I can phrase it to you, Lou,

261
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,720
to capture the spirit of what we air,

262
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,356
is think of our newscast
as a screaming woman

263
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:57,522
running down the street
with her throat cut.

264
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,494
I understand.

265
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:04,062
I'm a very, very quick learner.
You will be seeing me again.

266
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:05,964

00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:16,157
The situation is that I lost an employee,
and I'm interviewing for a replacement.

298
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:19,791
Okay. The ad didn't say
what the job was.

299
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,228
It's a fine opportunity
for some lucky someone.

300
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,766
Okay.

301
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:29,069
I'd like to know about your prior
employment and hear, in your own words,

302
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:31,911
what you learned from each position.

303
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,513
My old jobs?

304
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:38,378
I did landscaping for a couple months.

305
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,942
Like, mow, blow, and go.

306
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,617
I learned that I had
hay fever, so I quit.

307
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:49,423
Other jobs?

308
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:52,424
I don't know.
Like, a week here, a week there.

309
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:54,875
Why hire you?

310
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,263
Sell yourself.

311
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,434
- Okay.
- Go.

312
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:02,135
Okay.

313
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,411
I'm Rick. Of course.

314
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,109
I... I took three buses to get here.

315
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:12,512
I finished high school. I need a job.

316
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:15,549
I'll do pretty much anything.
That's me. Hire Rick.

317
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:16,681
So...

318
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,684
What's your address, Richard?

319
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:23,023
I don't have one.
Not a permanent one right now.

320
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:26,193
- You're homeless.
- I was for a while.

321
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,695
- You trick.
- Work the street? No.

322
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:31,465
- Wasn't a question.
- I'm straight.

323
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:34,468
Plenty of straight guys trick.
Do you have a driver's license?

324
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:36,136
Yeah.

325
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:39,239
- Do you know Los Angeles?
- Yeah. I grew up all around here.

326
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:42,607
- Can you start tonight?
- Doing what?

327
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,016
I run a successful TV news business.

328
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,985
We film breaking stories.

329
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:54,522
Maybe you saw my item this
morning of a fatal carjacking.

330
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:58,592
No. I don't have a TV,
but that sounds cool.

331
00:25:58,692 --> 00:25:59,993
Do you have a cellphone?

332
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:01,459
Yeah.

333
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:04,231
- Does it have GPS?
- Yes, it does.

334
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:07,932
- Congratulations. You're hired.
- Okay.

335
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,772
Your job will be to listen
to the emergency radio,

336
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:16,140
learn police codes,
help navigate, and watch the car.

337
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,742
Okay.

338
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:21,045
- And what does it pay?
- It's an internship.

339
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:26,253
Man, I...

340
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:29,489
I can't do that. I need money.

341
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:33,727
I'm giving you a chance to explore career
options and get insight into my organization.

342
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:37,531
It's not at all unusual for me to make
full-time job offers to my interns.

343
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,197
No, I know. I just...

344
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:46,070
I got to get paid, like,
something at least, you know.

345
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,310
I'll give you $30 cash per night.

346
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,313
Okay. Okay.

347
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,583
Thank you. Thanks.

That's too fast!

377
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,969
Talk to me, Richard.
Talk to me, Richard. What next?

Where are we going?

381
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,115
- Talk to me! What's next?
- Okay. Keeping on this five...

382
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:11,017
- No, six blocks. Then a right.
- On what?

383
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:14,652
I made a mistake!
It's a right five blocks back.

384
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,457
It's just five blocks.

385
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,275
- Did they bring him out?
- Ambulance left two minutes ago.

00:29:57,731 --> 00:30:00,200
I bet I wasted five dollars
of gas just getting here

389
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,833
or don't you think
that's a lot of money?

390
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,737
I'm sorry. I couldn't see the screen,
you were driving so fast.

391
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,442
Okay, first of all, Richard,

392
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:13,414
don't answer me by telling me a problem.
I have enough of those already.

393
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,817
Bring me a solution, and then we
can make a decision together.

394
00:30:17,517 --> 00:30:20,684
Okay. Maybe if you didn't rush me.

395
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:26,093
Don't rush you. Okay. I can use that.

396
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,962
See, Rick, they've done studies

397
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:33,033
and they found that in any system that
relies on cooperation from a school of fish,

398
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:35,469
say, or even a professional
hockey team, for example,

399
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:38,338
these experts have
identified communication

400
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:41,105
as the number one single key to success.

401
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:50,782
You know what "fear" stands for?

402
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,285

00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:55,086
"False Evidence Appearing Real."

404
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,726
You're going really fucking fast, dude.

405
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:02,529
Get out of your head, Rick.
It's a bad neighborhood.

406
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:05,098
Now, when you get a chance,
I'd like to know where we're going.

407
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,708
Left on Third. Six blocks.

408
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,477
Find a more appropriate place to park
the car, and don't get blocked in.

409
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:19,379
Are you the one that made the call?

410
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,714
No, no. I think...

411
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:23,683
I was trying to go to sleep,
and I heard a sound.

412
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:25,685
It scared me. That's why I called.

413
00:31:25,785 --> 00:31:29,053
- Sir, what's going on?
- Who the fuck are you?

414
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:37,998
- TV news. What happened?
- It was a shooting.

415
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:42,233
I told the cops that he was waving a gun
last week, but they didn't fucking care.

416
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,238
Can you try one more
time without swearing?

417
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:48,575
- I'm not doing it again.
- But this is for TV.

418
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:50,577
Yeah? I don't have a TV.

419
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,422
It's over.

420
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:04,455
Shot the place to shit.

421
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:15,435
All right, guys, pack it up.
Let's move it out.

422
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:19,403
...running out of there as fast as
we could. Through that window there.

423
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,189
<i>Great shot.</i>

424
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:31,675
Oh, that's fantastic.

425
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:34,634
Oh, that's a great piece of tape.

426
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:38,685
- You didn't get an interview with the couple?
- I have footage of them.

427
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,754
I have an interview with a neighbor.
She curses, but you can cut that out.

428
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,756
How did you get inside the house?

429
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,725
- The door was open.
- They allowed you?

430
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:48,328
I heard somebody yell to come in,
and when nobody was inside, I left.

431
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:50,297
And the only shot of the couple
is through a window?

432
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:52,825
- The police were shutting it down.
- I don't like it.

433
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:55,201
- Like what?
- The footage looks like he broke in.

434
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,738
There's no close-up of the homeowners
and he's giving us their name

435
00:33:57,838 --> 00:34:00,740
- off a piece of private correspondence.
- Excuse me, that's junk mail.

436
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,777
- Well, I have a problem with that.
- We'll knock out a killer package.

437
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,445
- This is my job.
- No!

438
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:08,715
Your job is writing the tweet of the day.
And getting Deb to turn sideways

439
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:12,019
during the weather forecast.
We're running it.

440
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:16,556
I like how you handled Frank.
You didn't soften the truth or dilute it.

441
00:34:16,656 --> 00:34:18,491
I think being clear with your
objectives is more important

442
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:22,295
than trying to present your ideas
in a non-confrontational manner.

443
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:26,633
- Do you have experience in an office?
- Myself? Not presently, no.

444
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,635
- Where did you get all that?
- I study a lot online.

445
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,272
- Yeah? Like what?
- All sorts of things, actually.

446
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:34,290
I'm on my computer all day.

447
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:37,444
I haven't had what you'd call
much of a formal education,

448
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:40,140
but you can find most anything
if you look hard enough.

449
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:51,691
Last year, I took an online
business course, for example.

450
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:56,629
And I learned that you have to have a
business plan before starting a business.

451
00:34:56,729 --> 00:35:01,865
And that why you pursue something is
equally as important as what you pursue.

452
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:05,238
The site advised you to...

453
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:09,142
answer the following question before you
decide where to focus your abilities.

454
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:13,243
The question was "What do I love to do?"

455
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,083
The site suggested making a list
of your strengths and weaknesses.

456
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:20,487
What am I good at?
What am I not good at?

457
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:22,489
Maybe I want to strengthen
and develop knowledge

458
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:26,390
about the things I'm already good at.
Maybe I want to strengthen my weaknesses.

459
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:34,408
I recently remade my list.

460
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:38,004
And I'm thinking

461
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:40,607
that television news

462
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:43,810
might just be something I love

463
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,677
as well as something
I happen to be good at.

464
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:02,359
On TV, it looks so real.

465
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:05,376
Yes. It does.

466
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:11,504
Well, I have a show to do.
Your check is at the desk.

467
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,940
Outstanding work, Lou.
Really, just great.

468
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,941
Thanks, Nina. That means an awful lot.

469
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:19,710
Okay.

470
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:45,728
<i>It's every parent's nightmare.</i>

471
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,875
<i>Imagine singing a lullaby to your
infant and tucking them into bed</i>

472
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,510
<i>and then having to shield them</i>

473
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,947
<i>as a barrage of high-caliber bullets
literally blast into your home.</i>

474
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:58,985
<i>For the Cahills of Echo Park,
that fear became a terrifying reality</i>

475
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:04,221
<i>when an adjacent house became the setting
for a scene right out of the Wild West.</i>

476
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:31,378
<i>Paying too much at the pump?
Well, sign up for our super saver card</i>

477
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:34,814
<i>and you'll be saving buckets

478
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:38,251
<i>Takes minutes to sign up

479
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:40,987

480
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:44,421
<i>So sign up now and start saving!</i>

481
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:09,649
Rick, I'm very pleased with how
you progressed. You're doing a great job.

482
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:12,385
However, you just spilled gasoline
on my car which will eat the paint.

483
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:15,321
I need you tighten up a bit on this.
Because if you fill it like that again,

484
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,622
I will terminate you immediately,
I promise you.

485
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:55,728
"Bed, Bath & Beyond."

486
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,861
Oh, that's a good store.

487
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:03,836
Making peace with what you don't have,
that's what it's all about.

488
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:08,174
Living with what you ain't got, right?
Don't you think?

489
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:10,643
<i>Traffic units, ambulance traffic,
Benedict Canyon.</i>

490
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:14,780
- <i>Overturned vehicle with injuries.</i>
- Crash with injuries. Good neighborhood.

491
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,286
TV news. What happened?

492
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:23,889
I think it was a head-on collision,
and there's a guy who's dead over there.

493
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,491
- There's a woman...
- Did you see what happened?

494
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,627
Am I supposed to help?
I didn't see, I came after.

495
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:30,630
- Can you tell me exactly what happened?
- Will you get the camera out of my face?

496
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,164
Get it out! I'm trying to talk to 911!

497
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,634
No, it's at... The guy is down.

498
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:25,475
Make some room! We'll block it off.

499
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:39,056
Not getting through here.

500
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:41,058
Son of a bitch.

501
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:43,062
Let's go.

502
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:44,461
Fuck this.

503
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,469
Here you go.

504
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:55,041
Ben Waterman wears
the same gold tie on Fridays.

505
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:58,308
We're leading with it.
That's your third start this week.

506
00:42:59,545 --> 00:43:01,514
I'm focusing on framing.

507
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:05,685
A proper frame not only draws the eye
into a picture but keeps it there longer,

508
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:09,452
dissolving the barrier between the
subject and the outside of the frame.

509
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:12,456
Is that blood on your shirt?

510
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,595
I don't think so.

511
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:19,966
I recently heard of a Mexican restaurant
called Cabanita. Have you heard of it?

512
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:21,999
It's also on your sleeve.

513
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,402
I didn't see that.

514
00:43:27,673 --> 00:43:30,574
What I'm asking is,
do you like Mexican food, Nina?

515
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:32,612
Yes.

516
00:43:32,712 --> 00:43:35,414
Stand by, people. Here we go.

517
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:39,148
Cabanita has been called
"an authentic taste of Mexico City."

518
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:44,721
Do you wanna go with me?
I think we could have fun together.

519
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:48,094
- Thanks, but I'm busy.
- Saturday is your night off, isn't it?

520
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:52,264
I have a rule, Lou.
I don't date people I work with.

521
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:55,499
- And I'm twice your age.
- I like older women.

522
00:43:56,202 --> 00:43:58,671
Besides, I don't work with you.
You're someone I sell to.

523
00:43:58,771 --> 00:44:01,273
And I don't wanna fuck that up.

524
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:03,610
What if by saying no, you fuck it up?

525
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,711
All right, 10 seconds to go and back on.

526
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:07,377
Is that what you're saying?

527
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:12,548
- I didn't say that.
- Eight, seven...

528
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:15,521
- ...six, five, four...
- Well, I don't know what to say.

529
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:17,957
...three, two, one.

530
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:20,092
Good morning. Thank you
for joining us. I'm Lisa Mays.

531
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:23,496
And I'm Ben Waterman.
First up on <i>This Morning</i> on KWLA News,

532
00:44:23,596 --> 00:44:27,834
a horrible car crash over in Benedict Canyon.
It's claimed the life now of one man.

533
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:30,000
Severely injured a young woman.

534
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,523
Hey, Lou!

535
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:37,877
Hey, man. Joe Loder, Mayhem.

536
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:42,148
Great get tonight. They were closing
it down by the time we showed up.

537
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:44,216
Were you waiting for me out here?

538
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:46,552
No, I was driving by and I saw your car.

539
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:49,555
You're not dropping your shit off,
are you? Nobody does that.

540
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:52,091
You need an air card if you
want to be in the game.

541
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:55,160
Import the video to your laptop.
Cut the video.

542
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,964
Upload to your FTP site and notify
stations you got something for sale.

543
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:02,866
Boom, boom, boom!
Otherwise, it's a nice ride.

544
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:07,206
Listen, man, you got a good run going
but there's valleys out there.

545
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:09,975
Take it from me.
I've been nightcrawling for 14 years.

546
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,778
- You heard I'm adding a second van?
- No. I didn't hear that.

547
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:15,014
Gonna be a game changer.

548
00:45:15,114 --> 00:45:19,018
Cut my on-scene time in half.
I'm setting up a dedicated dispatch, too.

549
00:45:19,118 --> 00:45:21,821
No more listening and driving.
That's for suckers.

550
00:45:21,921 --> 00:45:25,090
- You like the Canon 305s?
- Never used one.

551
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:30,797
Six thou a piece. 2.4 megapixels.
Night vision. 18:1 zoom.

552
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:33,499
I got one of those puppies
with your name on it.

553
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,900
I have a camera.

554
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,205
I want you running my second van.
Two crews. Half the area to cover.

555
00:45:39,305 --> 00:45:42,041
Now, I know what you're thinking.
Half the money, right?

556
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:44,110
You should be thinking, twice the sales.

557
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,746
Because we're going to be
the first at every scene.

558
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:49,014
Why compete when we can work together?

559
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:53,018
You can share my press cards.
Puppy dog off my police connections.

560
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:56,823
This is the big move, the next level.
We can corner this whole thing.

561
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:59,491
I'm talking about putting some
heavy digits in our pocket, brah.

562
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,795
Thank you for offering me the position
but working for myself is

563
00:46:02,895 --> 00:46:04,795
more in line with my skills
and career goals.

564
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,835
- Take a few days to think about it.
- No.

565
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:12,438
You'll need to hire someone else,
and I don't want to hold up the process.

566
00:46:12,538 --> 00:46:14,473
You want to be on
the inside of this, man

567
00:46:14,573 --> 00:46:17,309
because I'm going to be
tag-teaming every call.

568
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:22,548
You keep talking like it's something that
I may be interested in, but I'm not.

569
00:46:22,648 --> 00:46:24,950
You don't even understand the offer.

570
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,419
If you did, you'd be
fucking sucking my dick!

571
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:30,690
You'd be asking me questions.
What does this mean? What does that mean?

572
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:34,393
I feel like grabbing you
by your ears right now

573
00:46:34,493 --> 00:46:39,262
and screaming in your face,
"I'm not fucking interested."

574
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,234
Instead, I'm going to drive home
and do some accounting.

575
00:46:48,107 --> 00:46:49,988
Fuck you!

576
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:51,563
Twerp.

577
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,226
I didn't wake up until 5:00.

578
00:47:07,126 --> 00:47:10,827
My body is so off,
I feel like it's time for breakfast.

579
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,136
I bet you're beautiful
any time of the day.

580
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,872
In fact, I'd say

581
00:47:19,972 --> 00:47:22,263
you're much prettier than Lisa Mays.

582
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,445
I like the dark makeup on your eyes.
I also like the way you smell.

583
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,083
So, where you from, Lou?

584
00:47:35,054 --> 00:47:37,553
The north end of the Valley.

585
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:39,892
Some of the calls
sometimes take me over there,

586
00:47:39,992 --> 00:47:44,597
but nobody I know still lives out there.
You're from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

587
00:47:44,897 --> 00:47:46,799
How did you know that?

588
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,584
It's online.

589
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:52,540
Everything about you is online.
Not everything, but definitely a lot.

590
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:55,241
I've watched all the videos
from when you were a reporter.

591
00:47:55,341 --> 00:47:56,675
I'm sure you look at those, of course.

592
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:59,609
No. God, no.
Not without a drink in my hand.

593
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:03,215
I watch my work all the time.

594
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:06,382
- Yeah? Do you want to become a reporter?
- No.

595
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,489
- Most of you guys want air time.
- Not me.

596
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:13,626
I want to be the guy that owns
the station that owns the camera.

597
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:18,297
The business is going well,
but in order to grow to the next level,

598
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,967
I need to stay one step ahead
of my competition and take risks.

599
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:23,500
I also need financial support
to implement expansion.

600
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:27,137
Would you like another margarita?

601
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,773
One is enough.

602
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:32,742
Thanks for coming out to talk.

603
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:34,780
The place I'm in now

604
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,551
is that I want a relationship
with someone I can team up with

605
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:42,221
and share, like we share,
the same job and hours and whatnot.

606
00:48:42,321 --> 00:48:44,356
I could go down a laundry list,
but you get the idea.

607
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:48,191
Yes. Well, I hope you find someone.

608
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,598
Here's the thing about that, Nina.

609
00:48:52,398 --> 00:48:54,459
I'm quite certain I already have.

610
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,335
Okay.

611
00:48:59,238 --> 00:49:01,273
Let me put this politely.

612
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:06,309
I only came out to dinner with you, Lou,
purely as a professional courtesy.

613
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:09,989
Thank you.

614
00:49:11,984 --> 00:49:14,120
I don't think it's any secret
that I've single-handedly raised

615
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,286
the unit price of your ratings book.

616
00:49:18,057 --> 00:49:21,495
Our ratings book price?

617
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:25,164
I'm a very fast learner.

618
00:49:25,264 --> 00:49:28,131
We had a conversation where I specifically
mentioned that. Do you remember that?

619
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:32,538
- Well, do you?
- Yes.

620
00:49:32,638 --> 00:49:35,276
I recently learned,
for instance, that...

621
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:38,541
most Americans watch
local news to stay informed.

622
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:42,781
I also learned that the average half-hour
of Los Angeles television news

623
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:46,415
packs all of its local government coverage
including law enforcement,

624
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:50,756
budget, transportation, education
and immigration into 22 seconds.

625
00:49:50,856 --> 00:49:53,759
Local crime stories, however,
not only usually led the news

626
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:56,896
but filled 14 times the broadcast,
averaging five minutes and seven seconds.

627
00:49:56,996 --> 00:50:00,165
KWLA relies heavily on such stories.

628
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:03,681
With Los Angeles crime rates going down,
I think that makes items like mine

629
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:07,070
particularly valuable.
Like rare animals.

630
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,308
I can imagine that your needs will increase
during next month's rating sweeps period.

631
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:22,418
Yeah. Well, we certainly
appreciate what you do.

632
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,361
There's certain good things
about being alone.

633
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:37,503
You have time to do the things you
wanna do, like study and plan, but...

634
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:40,072
you can't have dinners like this
or be physical with a person.

635
00:50:40,172 --> 00:50:42,605
I mean, outside of flirtation-ship.

636
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:46,676
Where are you going with this?

637
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:50,380
I want that.

638
00:50:52,284 --> 00:50:53,817
With you.

639
00:50:56,588 --> 00:50:59,522
Like you want to keep your job
and your health insurance.

640
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,229
Look, just for starters,

641
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:07,233
I don't need you to keep my fucking job.

642
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:10,869
You're the news director
on the vampire shift

643
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:15,265
of the lowest-rated
station in Los Angeles.

644
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:21,647
We have what could be considered
an almost-exclusive relationship.

645
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:24,650
There are many other places I could go.

646
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,586
I have to think that you're
invested in this transaction.

647
00:51:27,986 --> 00:51:29,855
- Here you are.
- Wow.

648
00:51:29,955 --> 00:51:32,021
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

649
00:51:35,394 --> 00:51:39,598
Where did you get the balls to even
suggest something like this?

650
00:51:39,698 --> 00:51:43,102
- We're still talking.
- No. There's nothing more to say.

651
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:44,834
You can leave.

652
00:51:51,376 --> 00:51:55,614
Okay, look. You've done well. Okay?

653
00:51:55,714 --> 00:51:59,318
And we pay you well, very well.
We always have.

654
00:51:59,418 --> 00:52:03,222
If you like, I could get you
an exclusive retainer.

655
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:06,258
That would be on top
of your segment fees.

656
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:10,029
I could maybe even get you a job at the
station starting as a production assistant.

657
00:52:10,129 --> 00:52:12,097
So that you could learn
the business from the inside.

658
00:52:12,197 --> 00:52:14,230
That's where you
said your interests lie.

659
00:52:16,268 --> 00:52:18,267
You're not listening, Nina.

660
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:21,106
I happen to know that you
haven't stayed at one station

661
00:52:21,206 --> 00:52:25,274
for longer than two years at a time,
and you're coming up on two years soon.

662
00:52:27,946 --> 00:52:30,516
I can imagine that your contract
is for that length of time.

663
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:33,352
And that next month's ratings
directly affect that.

664
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:36,588
So, you're threatening
that if I don't...

665
00:52:36,688 --> 00:52:39,324
- I'm negotiating.
- You're threatening to stop selling to me.

666
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:41,627
That's your choice.

667
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:44,796
The true price of any item is what
somebody's willing to pay for it.

668
00:52:44,896 --> 00:52:48,533
You want something. And I want you.

669
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:49,899
To fuck you.

670
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:52,171
And as a friend.

671
00:52:52,471 --> 00:52:56,473
Jesus Christ, friends don't pressure
friends to fucking sleep with them.

672
00:52:57,676 --> 00:53:00,137
Actually, that's not true, Nina.

673
00:53:01,747 --> 00:53:04,484
Because as I'm sure you know,

674
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:09,919
a friend is a gift you give yourself.

675
00:53:42,321 --> 00:53:45,524
Okay, a left on Roth,
and then six blocks to the ramp.

676
00:53:45,624 --> 00:53:46,825
You're putting me on the 5?

677
00:53:46,925 --> 00:53:49,261
Yeah, the 2 to the 5
to the 110 to the 10.

678
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:51,997
Did you read my traffic memo yesterday?

679
00:53:52,097 --> 00:53:53,899
Did I read it?

680
00:53:54,199 --> 00:53:57,436
- Yeah, I read it.
- What did it say?

681
00:53:57,536 --> 00:54:01,039
- About the 5?
- Okay. I looked at it. What?

682
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:03,542
Well, for one thing, it included that
the 5 has floating construction

683
00:54:03,642 --> 00:54:06,478
in the fast lane for the next three weeks.
So, given that, I expect you to put me

684
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:08,747
on the 2 to the 101
to the 110 to the 10.

685
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:12,718
- That's half of one, six of the other.
- It's half dozen of one, six of the other.

686
00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:15,420
What I'd like you to do is admit that
you didn't read what you said you did.

687
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,390
You know I'm a reasonable person,
but nobody likes to be lied to!

688
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:22,294
Okay! When am I going to get my raise?
That's reasonable, right?

689
00:54:22,394 --> 00:54:24,830
You keep talking about this performance
review. When is it gonna happen?

690
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,933
I've been out here two months already,
busting my ass every night.

691
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:31,703
I'm tired of your promises for more pay, man.
I'm sleeping in a garage.

692
00:54:31,803 --> 00:54:35,307
Rick, trying to leverage your salary in this
economic environment is near impossible.

693
00:54:35,407 --> 00:54:39,311
Most firms have set starting wages. Ideally,
you could leverage with other offers,

694
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:42,147
but that's just not the case
in your situation right now.

695
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:45,083
<i>Test 498. Engine 91.
North division. Battalion 12.</i>

696
00:54:45,183 --> 00:54:47,886
<i>Heavy rescue. 56. Air ops respond.
Reported plane down.</i>

697
00:54:47,986 --> 00:54:50,022
- <i>Whiteman Field, south of Foothill.</i>
- Reroute us to that.

698
00:54:50,522 --> 00:54:53,992
We're, like 22 minutes from Foothill,
and only five from a hit and run.

699
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:57,627
They're rolling heavy rescue and an
air ambulance. Get me there, please.

700
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:15,781
It's good right there.
Stay on that spot.

701
00:55:15,881 --> 00:55:17,614
Not getting through here.

702
00:55:19,284 --> 00:55:21,152
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's all over here, buddy.

703
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,285
Turn it around, let's go.

704
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,789
You're late.

705
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:33,065
Hey, brah! Five fatals.
Come screaming out of the fucking sky.

706
00:55:33,165 --> 00:55:37,507
All lit up with the brush on fire.
Mine. Exclusive.

707
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:39,465
I'm banging!

708
00:55:40,138 --> 00:55:43,208
And my other van is in Carson,
getting the jumper.

709
00:55:43,308 --> 00:55:44,943
You know...

710
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:49,748
I was trying to hook you up, man.
I was trying to teach you something.

711
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:55,095
Welcome to the future, brah.

712
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:11,592
A car crash.

713
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:15,307
Well, none of this is
gonna knock anybody out.

714
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:19,108
I can't use any of this in my rundown.
Is this it?

715
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:23,882
- No, I have a stabbing in Corona.
- Where's the plane crash at Foothill?

716
00:56:23,982 --> 00:56:27,486
I don't mind saying that I'm trying to bring
you stories that happen here on the ground.

717
00:56:27,586 --> 00:56:31,456
- Two has it. It'll be their lead.
- Well, I hope that works well for them.

718
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:32,958
Now, let me show you
the stabbing in Corona.

719
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:36,528
I don't give a goddamn
about fucking Corona!

720
00:56:36,628 --> 00:56:41,033
You know how important this week is.
This shit is fucking death to me!

721
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:45,003
I understand your frustration. I was
just trying not to be too hard on myself.

722
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:48,273
I sold you upstairs as some
kind of fucking sweeps savior.

723
00:56:48,373 --> 00:56:52,709
And I'm leading with a
goddamn stabbing. In Corona!

724
00:56:53,378 --> 00:56:56,648
- So, you want that, then?
- I want you to get in the goddamn game!

725
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:59,117
I want something
people can't turn away from.

726
00:56:59,217 --> 00:57:02,084
I want what you fucking promised me!

727
00:57:14,032 --> 00:57:16,435
<i>Good morning, everyone.
Thanks for joining us. I'm Pat Harvey.</i>

728
00:57:16,535 --> 00:57:19,070
<i>Hope your day's getting off to
a good start. I'm Kent Shocknek.</i>

729
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,541
<i>We begin with a tragedy last night
in the foothills of Santa Susana Pass</i>

730
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:25,343
<i>where a private plane crashed
with no survivors.</i>

731
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:29,147
<i>CBS2 has obtained this exclusive video.
We want to remind you now</i>

732
00:57:29,247 --> 00:57:33,282
<i>that what you're about to see is graphic,
and viewer discretion is advised.</i>

733
00:58:32,243 --> 00:58:34,646
Since when did Coldwater
become faster than Laurel?

734
00:58:34,746 --> 00:58:37,516
Huh? What was the thinking there?

735
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:39,384
I didn't ask that to hear myself speak.

736
00:58:39,484 --> 00:58:42,187
Because, you know,
Coldwater only has six lights.

737
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:45,658
Yeah, but Laurel has places to pass.
I can't get around this person until Ventura.

738
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,627
It's the same argument, man.
I said this route.

739
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:50,996
If you wanted to take Laurel,
you should have said something.

740
00:58:51,096 --> 00:58:54,299
I thought that you worked in other factors.
If I didn't think that you could do better,

741
00:58:54,399 --> 00:58:56,134
I wouldn't ride you so hard
about the routes.

742
00:58:56,234 --> 00:58:57,736
I think you know that, Rick.

743
00:58:57,836 --> 00:59:00,235
I think it may just be possible that
I have a higher opinion of you

744
00:59:00,335 --> 00:59:02,173
than you have of yourself.

745
00:59:03,036 --> 00:59:04,507
What the fuck? God damn it!

746
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,723
Seriously?

747
00:59:09,514 --> 00:59:13,552
To get to a van crash on Moorpark?
Who cares? What's the rush?

748
00:59:14,152 --> 00:59:17,320
Why aren't we at the rape at
Griffith Park like everybody else?

749
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:26,523
Oh, fuck!

750
00:59:26,623 --> 00:59:30,068
Oh, fuck me. Oh, God!
That's the fucking Mayhem van.

751
00:59:30,168 --> 00:59:33,605
Joe Loder and the other dude.
What's his name? Fucking Marcus.

752
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,872
Park the car and get your camera.

753
00:59:39,277 --> 00:59:41,379
Now, let's get one guy inside.
Hold the seats back.

754
00:59:41,479 --> 00:59:44,449
- You can't get that in right there?
- No, there's no room.

755
00:59:46,518 --> 00:59:48,151
Here we go.

756
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:54,945
What the hell happened?

757
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,763
According to witnesses, they were
driving at a high rate of speed,

758
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,216
probably toward Griffith Park,
when, apparently,

759
01:00:01,316 --> 01:00:04,800
they ran head-on into this light pole.
No other car. Single vehicle.

760
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:07,772
How did they just run into a pole?

761
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:16,247
Get that backboard
right up against him. Easy.

762
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:18,550
Hey, don't film that, man.
He's one of us.

763
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,820
Not anymore, Rick. We're professionals.

764
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,589
He's a sale.

765
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:27,390
Got facial trauma.
Got lacerations all the way down...

766
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:30,629
- Yeah, I'm calling it in.
- Minimize that movement.

767
01:00:30,729 --> 01:00:34,130
Get him back in the ambulance and put
some oxygen on him. Drop him down.

768
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,002
- Keep pressure on him.
- Back that unit off.

769
01:00:37,102 --> 01:00:39,652
Yeah, let's get some
four-by-fours on there.

770
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:42,741
Bring the gurney all the way up.

771
01:00:42,841 --> 01:00:44,976
Come on, let's go. Stay with me.

772
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:46,978
I got him, I got him.

773
01:00:47,078 --> 01:00:49,478
- Make sure you size him right.
- All right.

774
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,774
Man, we are way the hell out here.

775
01:01:25,917 --> 01:01:28,787
<i>Any Mission unit.
Residential 211 in progress.</i>

776
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:32,457
<i>37 Bonhill Road.
Receiving 211 siren activation.</i>

777
01:01:32,557 --> 01:01:35,560
Armed response on a home invasion.

778
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,872
We're five blocks away. Pull a U-turn.

779
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:50,709
At the end of the street. Coming up.

780
01:01:50,809 --> 01:01:53,042
4808. Here!

781
01:01:58,182 --> 01:01:59,751
We beat the police.

782
01:01:59,851 --> 01:02:02,018
- What do you want me to do?
- You know what to do, Rick!

783
01:04:27,432 --> 01:04:29,401
<i>3-X-21. Go ahead.</i>

784
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:33,569
<i>3-X-21, confirm address
on the 211 at Bonhill Road.</i>

785
01:05:34,865 --> 01:05:36,901
What is going on?

786
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:38,369
- We're leaving.
- What?

787
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:42,240
What's in there? What's going on?
What happened in there?

788
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,675
You should have walked in and looked,
Rick, if you're that curious.

789
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:46,845
That's what I'm paying you to do.
You need to show initiative.

790
01:05:46,945 --> 01:05:49,280
There is no better way
to achieve job security

791
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:51,849
than by making yourself
an indispensable employee.

792
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:53,084
I heard gunshots!

793
01:05:53,184 --> 01:05:55,019
All the more reason you
might have helped me.

794
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,088
You might have learned a new
skill that made you more useful

795
01:05:57,188 --> 01:05:59,054
and put us on a track toward growth!

796
01:06:36,794 --> 01:06:37,929
Stay in the car.

797
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:40,462
- Why?
- Because I said so.

798
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:29,013
We have a hit-and-run in Beverly Hills,

799
01:07:29,113 --> 01:07:31,916
a car versus pedestrian
incident and a robbery.

800
01:07:32,016 --> 01:07:34,909
- Do we have footage of the crash?
- Surveillance footage.

801
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:41,859
I've been trying to reach you
for the last hour.

802
01:07:41,959 --> 01:07:46,140
In the future, when you don't have anything,
man up and don't dodge my fucking calls.

803
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,095
I do have something.

804
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:49,934
What?

805
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:53,538
Home invasion,
triple murder in Granada Hills.

806
01:07:53,638 --> 01:07:56,838
- That's just breaking now.
- We got there before the police.

807
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:00,763
You have it?

808
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:06,251
I'm not going to list the many
benefits of this piece.

809
01:08:06,351 --> 01:08:09,220
I think it's probably best if
you just watch it for yourself.

810
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,790
I could have had someone out there
by now. Why didn't you call it in?

811
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:14,743
To increase your need,
and improve my bargaining position.

812
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:18,527
Frank, Jenny! Bay 2, now!

813
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:49,158
Get Linda in here.

814
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:02,707
Home invasion in Granada.
He got there before the cops.

815
01:09:02,807 --> 01:09:05,741
We have 10 minutes to airtime.
How much of this can we show?

816
01:09:06,844 --> 01:09:10,348
- You mean, legally?
- No, morally. Of course, legally.

817
01:09:10,448 --> 01:09:11,482
Have they been identified?

818
01:09:11,582 --> 01:09:14,819
It just happened, so you have to assume no,
and that's just one of the issues.

819
01:09:14,919 --> 01:09:17,955
We can't broadcast their identities
without notifying the next of kin.

820
01:09:18,055 --> 01:09:20,959
- We're not identifying them.
- You are by proxy, by showing their faces.

821
01:09:21,059 --> 01:09:22,727
We pixelate the faces.

822
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,429
- Where did you get this?
- Stringer.

823
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:26,698
Hi, Linda. I'm Lou.

824
01:09:27,098 --> 01:09:29,567
Jesus. Is there a dead
baby inside of there?

825
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:31,102
No. The crib was empty.

826
01:09:31,202 --> 01:09:33,969
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Are we breaking the law by showing this?

827
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:41,028
Block the faces, don't give out the
exact address. Do that, I guess.

828
01:09:41,128 --> 01:09:44,115
I don't know. I wouldn't think so, no.

829
01:09:44,215 --> 01:09:46,317
- Journalistically and ethically?
- This isn't Hartford.

830
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:50,621
- We are beyond all broadcast standards.
- Have you seen the overnights?

831
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:53,924
- I'll risk the fine.
- What did you pay for this?

832
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:56,482
The price hasn't been negotiated yet.

833
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,494
Give us a minute. Thanks.

834
01:10:04,602 --> 01:10:06,837
- How much?
- $100,000.

835
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:08,940
- How much?
- $50,000.

836
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,309
I need a number. Nine minutes.
I need a number.

837
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:13,678
- I just gave you two.
- $3,000.

838
01:10:14,178 --> 01:10:17,148
- I got $3,000 for the food truck stabbings.
- There were more dead.

839
01:10:17,248 --> 01:10:20,451
Those were poor Mexican people in a
roach coach. Two of them were illegals.

840
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:23,521
These are three wealthy white people,
shot and killed in their mansion.

841
01:10:23,621 --> 01:10:27,758
Including a suburban housewife
shotgunned in her bed. I know you, Nina.

842
01:10:27,858 --> 01:10:29,260
I know your interest and
excitement in this product

843
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,982
is greater than the
amount you're offering.

844
01:10:38,736 --> 01:10:40,671
- $5,000.
- $30,000.

845
01:10:40,771 --> 01:10:41,705
- $7,000.
- $25,000.

846
01:10:41,805 --> 01:10:42,673
- $8,000.
- $15,000.

847
01:10:42,773 --> 01:10:44,842
- $9,000.
- $15,000.

848
01:10:44,942 --> 01:10:46,177
- $10,000.
- $15,000.

849
01:10:46,277 --> 01:10:49,013
- Give me a serious number.
- $15,000.

850
01:10:49,113 --> 01:10:52,750
Can't do it. Never happen. There's a matter
of precedent. Ten is my last best offer.

851
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:54,247
Okay.

852
01:10:54,985 --> 01:10:57,989
Really? Where are you going?

853
01:10:58,389 --> 01:11:00,758
Seven has approached me
at least several times.

854
01:11:00,858 --> 01:11:03,679
The ND there gave me his number.
They'll make me a better offer.

855
01:11:03,779 --> 01:11:06,556
- It's a five-minute drive.
- Hold on!

856
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,573
- Twelve.
- Fifteen.

857
01:11:15,673 --> 01:11:18,709
I can't spend a month's budget
on a single story.

858
01:11:18,809 --> 01:11:19,908
What if the story's not over?

859
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:22,780
The people who did this escaped.

860
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,450
They're still out there,
walking around with the rest of us.

861
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,387
If I had a family and I lived in a home,
that might make me nervous.

862
01:11:29,487 --> 01:11:31,489
I'd want updates on what was going on.

863
01:11:31,589 --> 01:11:34,809
With this footage, people would
turn to your channel for the story.

864
01:11:35,326 --> 01:11:38,829
I like you, Nina. And I look
forward to our time together.

865
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:43,267
But you have to understand.
$15,000 isn't all that I want.

866
01:11:43,367 --> 01:11:45,203
From here on, starting now,

867
01:11:45,303 --> 01:11:47,905
I want my work to be credited
by the anchors and on a burn.

868
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:50,809
The name of my company is
Video Production News,

869
01:11:50,909 --> 01:11:52,610
a professional news-gathering service.

870
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,513
That's how it should be read
and that's how it should be said.

871
01:11:55,613 --> 01:11:58,683
I also want to go to the next rung,
and meet your team.

872
01:11:58,783 --> 01:12:00,718
And the station manager
and the director and the anchors.

873
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:02,853
And start developing my
own personal relationships.

874
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:05,173
I'd like to start meeting them this morning.
You'll take me around,

875
01:12:05,273 --> 01:12:07,992
you'll introduce me as the owner and
President of Video Production News

876
01:12:08,092 --> 01:12:11,262
and remind them of some
of my many other stories.

877
01:12:11,362 --> 01:12:12,456
I'm not done.

878
01:12:12,556 --> 01:12:16,000
I also want to stop our discussion
over prices. This will save time.

879
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,903
So when I say that a particular number is
my lowest price, that's my lowest price.

880
01:12:19,003 --> 01:12:22,373
And you can be assured that I arrived at
whatever that number is very carefully.

881
01:12:22,473 --> 01:12:26,444
Now, when I say that
I want these things,

882
01:12:27,044 --> 01:12:30,948
I mean that I want them.
And I don't want to have to ask again.

883
01:12:31,048 --> 01:12:34,152
And the last thing that I want, Nina, is for
you to do the things that I ask you to do

884
01:12:34,252 --> 01:12:37,686
when we're alone together in
your apartment. Not like the last time!

885
01:12:41,392 --> 01:12:42,160
So...

886
01:12:44,728 --> 01:12:46,395
I'll tell you what.

887
01:12:47,465 --> 01:12:51,202
I have the van crash on Moorpark tonight.
It was a couple of stringers, actually.

888
01:12:51,302 --> 01:12:53,825
That could lead by itself
on an average night.

889
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:56,095
I'd be willing to
throw that in for free.

890
01:12:58,976 --> 01:13:01,309
So what do you say, do we have a deal?

891
01:13:04,982 --> 01:13:07,151
Lisa Mays, Ben Waterman, Lou Bloom.

892
01:13:07,251 --> 01:13:08,986
- Hi.
- Hello. How are you, Lisa?

893
01:13:09,086 --> 01:13:11,689
You remember Lou from
the Benedict Canyon crash.

894
01:13:11,789 --> 01:13:13,090
Oh, yeah. Amazing stuff.

895
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:15,359
That was my company,
Video Production News.

896
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:16,861
I would just like to say

897
01:13:16,961 --> 01:13:20,364
that I think that what the two
of you do is incredibly valuable.

898
01:13:20,464 --> 01:13:21,899
- Thank you.
- That's nice of you to say.

899
01:13:21,999 --> 01:13:23,507
We appreciate it.

900
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:26,070
I don't know how long this tape runs,
we might dump out.

901
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,339
Twenty seconds to back.
Ben and Lisa, 20 seconds to back.

902
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:30,674
Set up a sting dig,
Camera Two on a two-shot.

903
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:32,777
- Where's the banner?
- Did we decide on one?

904
01:13:32,877 --> 01:13:35,346
Horror House. What did we talk about?

905
01:13:35,446 --> 01:13:38,382
Can you build that?
Put it on CG-one. Back in 10 seconds.

906
01:13:38,482 --> 01:13:41,786
Nine, eight, seven, six,

907
01:13:42,186 --> 01:13:45,022
five, four, three,

908
01:13:45,122 --> 01:13:47,758
two, one. Sting it.

909
01:13:49,193 --> 01:13:51,862
Mics. Dissolve. Cue.

910
01:13:51,962 --> 01:13:54,265
<i>Hello, everybody.
This is KWLA with breaking news.</i>

911
01:13:54,365 --> 01:13:56,034
<i>Over the last half-hour or so,</i>

912
01:13:56,134 --> 01:13:59,804
<i>we've now received word of an apparent
home invasion triple homicide</i>

913
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:02,206
<i>in the Granada Hills area
of the San Fernando Valley.</i>

914
01:14:02,306 --> 01:14:04,208
<i>Now, at present,
the number of those dead...</i>

915
01:14:04,308 --> 01:14:06,344
- Preset Camera Two.
- <i>...have not been confirmed yet by the police</i>

916
01:14:06,444 --> 01:14:11,349
<i>but KWLA has obtained exclusive
footage from inside the crime scene</i>

917
01:14:11,649 --> 01:14:13,718
<i>in which at least three
bodies can be observed.</i>

918
01:14:13,818 --> 01:14:16,320
<i>Now, we're going to show you
segments of that footage</i>

919
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:19,457
<i>throughout the rest of this broadcast,
but also throughout the day.</i>

920
01:14:19,557 --> 01:14:22,660
Ben, Lisa, I have a tape. When you're ready,
throw to it. I'll follow you.

921
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,564
<i>Again, we're about to show
you exclusive KWLA video</i>

922
01:14:26,664 --> 01:14:28,299
<i>from inside the actual crime scene.</i>

923
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:31,535
- It's graphic. Repeat it.
- <i>And before broadcasting this video,</i>

924
01:14:31,635 --> 01:14:35,439
<i>we want to warn our viewers that
these are extremely graphic images.</i>

925
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:38,275
<i>And I'm hearing from our control
room that we have that video,</i>

926
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,944
<i>- and we're going to show it now.
- Let's roll it now.</i>

927
01:14:40,044 --> 01:14:43,414
<i>This is footage that we have
obtained exclusively by KWLA</i>

928
01:14:43,514 --> 01:14:47,084
<i>from Video Production News. This is a
professional news-gathering service.</i>

929
01:14:47,184 --> 01:14:51,655
<i>And this is what appears to be a shotgun,
something you might use for home defense.</i>

930
01:14:51,755 --> 01:14:54,158
<i>You can see the pistol grips
on the front and the back there.</i>

931
01:14:54,258 --> 01:14:56,060
<i>Quite possibly the murder weapon.</i>

932
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,896
<i>And now, Lisa, as we move inside,
this is a beautiful home.</i>

933
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:01,299
<i>A beautiful home in a
very safe neighborhood.</i>

934
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:03,434
<i>Or, what most people think
is a safe neighborhood.</i>

935
01:15:03,534 --> 01:15:06,570
<i>And it appears that
that is the first body.</i>

936
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,739
<i>A young woman,
I'm guessing, from this angle.</i>

937
01:15:08,839 --> 01:15:10,541
<i>A young woman on a sofa, there.</i>

938
01:15:10,641 --> 01:15:13,344
<i>All of the faces, though,
have been blurred out.</i>

939
01:15:13,444 --> 01:15:16,647
- They've escaped. They're on the loose.
- <i>That is the first of what we understand</i>

940
01:15:16,747 --> 01:15:19,283
<i>are three bodies in the
home in Granada Hills.</i>

941
01:15:19,383 --> 01:15:24,188
<i>And this was committed by a suspect,
or suspects who are still out there.</i>

942
01:15:24,288 --> 01:15:26,907
<i>They're believed to have escaped.
And if you think about that,</i>

943
01:15:27,007 --> 01:15:29,193
- <i>that is a very frightening thought.</i>
- Repeat that.

944
01:15:29,293 --> 01:15:32,830
<i>Yes, scary, and very concerning,
particularly given what we're looking at here.</i>

945
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:35,499
<i>The savagery of what
these pictures show.</i>

946
01:15:35,599 --> 01:15:37,101
<i>And now, look, there on the floor.</i>

947
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:39,904
Lisa, what is that?
A bloodied article of clothing?

948
01:15:40,004 --> 01:15:41,505
<i>It looks like a silk shirt.</i>

949
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:44,675
- <i>Maybe a woman's silk blouse.</i>
- <i>It's just so sad.</i>

950
01:15:44,775 --> 01:15:46,610
Stand by to dissolve, Two.

951
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:49,113
<i>...obviously, there is the second body.</i>

952
01:15:49,213 --> 01:15:50,648
- They've escaped. Repeat it.
- <i>The person or people</i>

953
01:15:50,748 --> 01:15:53,317
<i>who committed all of this
brutal home invasion robbery,</i>

954
01:15:53,417 --> 01:15:56,687
<i>they're presently unidentified
and at large, still on the streets.</i>

955
01:15:56,787 --> 01:15:59,557
- Hit it again. Harder.
- <i>This has got to be a huge worry</i>

956
01:15:59,657 --> 01:16:02,626
<i>not only to the residents in this
neighborhood, Granada Hills area as well.</i>

957
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,144
<i>All of Los Angeles,
if you think about it.</i>

958
01:16:04,244 --> 01:16:06,864
<i>Yeah, the entire Southland, really.
Tonight, absolutely.</i>

959
01:16:06,964 --> 01:16:09,500
<i>An apparent family attacked,
savagely killed.</i>

960
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,571
<i>We believe this is their own home.
In what is one of the quieter,</i>

961
01:16:13,671 --> 01:16:16,840
<i>I think a frankly more upscale
and affluent neighborhoods</i>

962
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,810
- <i>in the whole Valley.</i>
- <i>In all of Los Angeles.</i>

963
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:22,212
<i>And now, as we're moving,
this is a nursery.</i>

964
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:23,414
<i>- And you hope to God...</i>
- Build it.

965
01:16:23,514 --> 01:16:25,849
<i>...that there's not a baby in that crib.</i>

966
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:28,218
<i>Yeah, you're just praying
that that crib is empty.</i>

967
01:16:28,318 --> 01:16:30,221
<i>Because this is definitely
a child's room.</i>

968
01:16:30,421 --> 01:16:33,223
<i>And, now, as we look, thank goodness.
Absolutely great.</i>

969
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:36,860
<i>In fact, our understanding right now is
that there was no baby found in the house.</i>

970
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,330
<i>Or any baby that was seen at all by
the people who filmed this for us.</i>

971
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,600
- <i>Thank goodness.</i>
- <i>That's Video News,</i>

972
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,603
<i>this is a professional
news-gathering service that we use.</i>

973
01:16:45,703 --> 01:16:47,771
<i>Apparently, what we're hearing
from their photographer</i>

974
01:16:47,871 --> 01:16:51,241
<i>is that they arrived even
before the police did.</i>

975
01:16:51,341 --> 01:16:55,579
<i>And then entered this home to help,
or at least offer some sort of assistance</i>

976
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,514
<i>and then came upon what
you're looking at here.</i>

977
01:16:57,614 --> 01:16:59,950
- <i>They came upon three bodies.</i>
- <i>Gruesome crime scenes that we're watching.</i>

978
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:02,853
<i>And that, right there is
the third body on the floor.</i>

979
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:05,923
<i>This is a man, gray hair. What would
you think, Lisa? Maybe 40s, 50s?</i>

980
01:17:06,023 --> 01:17:09,327
- <i>Yeah, 50s. Maybe even 60s.</i>
- "Vicious attack."

981
01:17:09,427 --> 01:17:11,262
<i>We've been looking at all
this graphic footage</i>

982
01:17:11,362 --> 01:17:13,464
<i>and just the viciousness,
the severity of violence.</i>

983
01:17:13,564 --> 01:17:15,199
Stand by master control,
we're going to come to a break.

984
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:17,668
We're going to commercial, then cutting
to Joel and a police statement.

985
01:17:17,768 --> 01:17:22,072
<i>I'm getting word right now that police
are getting ready to issue a statement</i>

986
01:17:22,172 --> 01:17:25,009
<i>from the scene and
Joel Beatty is there for that.</i>

987
01:17:25,109 --> 01:17:26,777
<i>And I think right now,
we're going to take a quick break.</i>

988
01:17:26,877 --> 01:17:30,414
Ready to break in five, four...
Sneak in your music.

989
01:17:30,514 --> 01:17:33,083
Three, two, one.

990
01:17:33,183 --> 01:17:35,953
Fade to black. Roll your break.
That's a 10-share.

991
01:17:37,488 --> 01:17:41,025
I want theme music on the return,
the cut we used for the Simi rail crash.

992
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:43,293
Audio, cut 32, please.
Cut 32 when we come back.

993
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:50,334
- Hello?
- Rolling with your banner.

994
01:17:50,434 --> 01:17:52,133
Thank you.

995
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:54,938
Actually, he'd like to meet you.

996
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:56,740
Come back, One, and key on Ben.

997
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,676
<i>Hey, heads up, you guys.
The police spokesman</i>

998
01:17:58,776 --> 01:18:01,276
<i>- is making an announcement in 60 seconds.</i>
- I gotta go.

999
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:05,783
<i>Nina, we are getting a ton of heat from
the police out here about that video.</i>

1000
01:18:06,383 --> 01:18:08,786
- Tell them to call the station.
- Fifteen seconds.

1001
01:18:08,886 --> 01:18:10,708
<i>They want to talk to
the person who shot it.</i>

1002
01:18:10,808 --> 01:18:13,857
I shot it.
Joel, it's Video Production News.

1003
01:18:13,957 --> 01:18:16,627
- Tell them to call me.
- Lou, they can't hear you.

1004
01:18:16,727 --> 01:18:17,995
Coming back in five,

1005
01:18:18,395 --> 01:18:22,332
four, three, two, one.

1006
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:23,767
Fade up.

1007
01:18:28,906 --> 01:18:32,076
<i>We have more information coming in
from the Granada Hills area</i>

1008
01:18:32,176 --> 01:18:34,144
<i>and the scene of an
apparent home invasion</i>

1009
01:18:34,244 --> 01:18:37,014
<i>that has left a husband and wife
and their housekeeper...</i>

1010
01:18:37,114 --> 01:18:38,415
<i>What we know at the moment is that</i>

1011
01:18:38,515 --> 01:18:42,153
<i>at some time around 5:00 this morning,</i>
<i>gunmen broke into this upscale...</i>

1012
01:18:42,253 --> 01:18:45,422
<i>Residents are disturbed and concerned
by the brutal triple murder...</i>

1013
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:47,591
<i>The way we got it, though,
is a video production crew</i>

1014
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:49,093
<i>that we work with from time to time.</i>

1015
01:18:49,193 --> 01:18:52,963
<i>They, apparently, arrived on the scene in
Granada Hills before the police got there.</i>

1016
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:55,933
- <i>Before anybody.</i>
- <i>The photographer who took those pictures</i>

1017
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:58,502
<i>told us earlier that
he walked up to the door,</i>

1018
01:18:58,602 --> 01:19:01,205
<i>he saw what we all saw in his videotape.</i>

1019
01:19:01,305 --> 01:19:04,174
<i>And then he started to look inside,
so that he could help</i>

1020
01:19:04,274 --> 01:19:06,009
<i>or render assistance to someone.</i>

1021
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:09,079
<i>That's when he walked into the house
and started shooting the video.</i>

1022
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:11,381
<i>- He found the three deceased in the house.
- He found the three bodies.</i>

1023
01:19:11,481 --> 01:19:13,339
<i>The two females and the one...</i>

1024
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:26,430
- Hello.
- Hi.

1025
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:29,433
I'm Detective Frontieri.
This is my partner, Detective Lieberman.

1026
01:19:29,533 --> 01:19:32,002
- Are you Louis Bloom?
- Yes, I'm Lou.

1027
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:34,338
- You live here?
- Yes, that's right.

1028
01:19:34,438 --> 01:19:35,606
May we come inside?

1029
01:19:35,806 --> 01:19:36,974
- Why?
- Why not?

1030
01:19:37,074 --> 01:19:39,009
- You want to?
- Yes.

1031
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,643
- I don't care.
- Wonderful.

1032
01:19:46,984 --> 01:19:50,220
- You were in Granada Hills last night.
- Yes, that's right.

1033
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,124
- You shot the video in the house?
- Yes, ma'am, I did. That's right.

1034
01:19:54,224 --> 01:19:57,708
You went inside the house?
You filmed all through the house?

1035
01:19:58,595 --> 01:20:01,632
You even filmed the bodies.
All before the police came.

1036
01:20:01,832 --> 01:20:04,134
- That door was open, ma'am.
- Detective.

1037
01:20:04,234 --> 01:20:08,372
The door was open and what I did was
I went in to see if I could help,

1038
01:20:08,472 --> 01:20:11,375
- because the alarm was ringing.
- An active crime scene.

1039
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:13,608
I didn't know it was a crime scene.

1040
01:20:14,344 --> 01:20:15,613
You knew what it was.

1041
01:20:15,913 --> 01:20:18,015
I know that an alarm means
someone is in trouble.

1042
01:20:18,215 --> 01:20:20,518
And you sold it to be shown on TV.

1043
01:20:20,618 --> 01:20:22,553
We're a professional
news-gathering service.

1044
01:20:22,953 --> 01:20:24,922
What did you see when you arrived?

1045
01:20:25,022 --> 01:20:28,926
- Two men leaving in a vehicle.
- You saw two men?

1046
01:20:29,026 --> 01:20:31,929
They were just shapes, really.
I was afraid, so I hid.

1047
01:20:32,029 --> 01:20:35,632
And then I saw the shapes of two men
moving inside the vehicle, if that helps.

1048
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:39,703
- Describe the men.
- It was dark. And then they drove away.

1049
01:20:39,803 --> 01:20:41,872
- Black? White? Tall?
- I couldn't see.

1050
01:20:41,972 --> 01:20:44,472
- What were they driving?
- An SUV.

1051
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:48,378
- Dark-colored.
- Rims? Tinted windows?

1052
01:20:48,478 --> 01:20:50,748
Maybe. Not that I saw.

1053
01:20:50,948 --> 01:20:52,950
Do you have any film
on the men or the car?

1054
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,619
No, I don't. I only started
filming when I was inside.

1055
01:20:57,487 --> 01:20:59,056
I'd like a copy of that footage.

1056
01:20:59,656 --> 01:21:01,625
Do I have to give it to you?

1057
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:04,161
Is there any reason why you wouldn't?

1058
01:21:04,261 --> 01:21:07,297
No, no, I made you a copy.
I expected someone to come.

1059
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:18,299
What's up, man?

1060
01:22:19,136 --> 01:22:21,672
I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

1061
01:22:21,972 --> 01:22:23,522
Why are we starting so early?

1062
01:22:24,474 --> 01:22:27,809
One of the people in the
house last night was alive.

1063
01:22:29,179 --> 01:22:31,148
I cut that part out.

1064
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:33,317
I also cut out the men
leaving in their car.

1065
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:35,605
I have a name and an address.
We're gonna drive there.

1066
01:22:35,705 --> 01:22:37,954
We're gonna find the person
that drove that car.

1067
01:22:39,174 --> 01:22:41,659
So you know who killed those people?

1068
01:22:42,259 --> 01:22:44,025
One of them, quite possibly, yes.

1069
01:22:45,262 --> 01:22:46,964
You gotta call the cops.

1070
01:22:47,264 --> 01:22:48,796
And we will, at the right time.

1071
01:22:57,641 --> 01:23:01,042
I'm offering you a real
opportunity here, Rick.

1072
01:23:01,611 --> 01:23:03,123
To do what?

1073
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,620
I don't usually share my business
plan with you.

1074
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,657
But a moment has arrived
that could allow the company

1075
01:23:13,757 --> 01:23:16,624
to make enough money
to expand to the next level.

1076
01:23:18,128 --> 01:23:20,238
We could call this...

1077
01:23:22,799 --> 01:23:25,222
the critical moment.

1078
01:23:25,936 --> 01:23:30,341
I'm inviting you, Rick, to be a part of
the team that pounces on this opportunity.

1079
01:23:30,741 --> 01:23:32,574
You've been asking a lot about
your performance review.

1080
01:23:33,343 --> 01:23:35,716
- Yeah.
- Well.

1081
01:23:36,313 --> 01:23:38,148
For starters,

1082
01:23:38,648 --> 01:23:41,916
I've been seeing a great improvement in
your overall focus and order-following.

1083
01:23:43,153 --> 01:23:46,433
Given complex problems, you're developing
a real ability to find clear

1084
01:23:46,533 --> 01:23:50,027
and simple solutions. I'm also
aware of your increased enthusiasm.

1085
01:23:50,127 --> 01:23:52,495
It's great to see your eyes light up
when you're working on a new idea.

1086
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:57,365
I hope you'll be inspiring us with your
innovative thinking for years to come.

1087
01:23:58,802 --> 01:24:01,803
Thank you, man. I'm trying. You know?

1088
01:24:03,073 --> 01:24:05,208
Which is why I'm promoting you

1089
01:24:05,308 --> 01:24:08,080
to Executive Vice President

1090
01:24:08,351 --> 01:24:10,470
of Video News.

1091
01:24:12,382 --> 01:24:14,315
What am I now?

1092
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:16,885
You're an assistant.

1093
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:21,879
That's... Big.

1094
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:29,499
- Does it come with a raise?
- Absolutely.

1095
01:24:30,477 --> 01:24:32,099
How much?

1096
01:24:33,303 --> 01:24:36,070
Pick a number. You pick a number.

1097
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,131
A...

1098
01:24:44,481 --> 01:24:48,716
$75 a night?

1099
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,232
Agreed.

1100
01:24:53,523 --> 01:24:55,892
What about... What about more? You know?

1101
01:24:55,992 --> 01:24:59,482
Not now. We closed the deal.

1102
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:05,967
- I could have gotten more, couldn't I?
- Absolutely.

1103
01:25:08,371 --> 01:25:10,707
All right. It's coming up on the left.

1104
01:25:11,007 --> 01:25:14,742
Halfway down the block.
1701 North Burns.

1105
01:25:25,355 --> 01:25:27,424
- Is that the car?
- That's the car.

1106
01:25:27,524 --> 01:25:28,589
Oh, shit.

1107
01:25:50,614 --> 01:25:53,683
- Do you think there's a reward?
- There is a reward.

1108
01:25:53,783 --> 01:25:56,178
- How much?
- $50,000.

1109
01:25:57,354 --> 01:26:00,180
- Do I get any of that?
- I just gave you a raise.

1110
01:26:01,525 --> 01:26:04,461
That's salary. I mean,
like a bonus, you know?

1111
01:26:04,561 --> 01:26:07,264
Bonuses come at the end of the year.

1112
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:16,706
So, we're gonna call it in?

1113
01:26:16,806 --> 01:26:18,675
- We're gonna wait.
- For what?

1114
01:26:18,775 --> 01:26:20,377
First, we want to see
if he's actually inside.

1115
01:26:20,477 --> 01:26:23,811
And then, we want to find a more
interesting place to film the arrest.

1116
01:26:24,614 --> 01:26:26,057
Like where?

1117
01:26:28,418 --> 01:26:30,153
Anywhere we want.

1118
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:33,257
What we're going to do, is we're gonna
wait and then we're gonna follow him.

1119
01:26:34,057 --> 01:26:36,793
When he reaches what would be considered
a better or more populated neighborhood,

1120
01:26:36,893 --> 01:26:40,397
then we'll report his location to the police.
He's a violent, wanted criminal.

1121
01:26:40,497 --> 01:26:43,831
I can't believe that he's just
going to peacefully surrender.

1122
01:26:50,407 --> 01:26:52,473
Okay. I want more money.

1123
01:26:53,076 --> 01:26:54,242
A lot more.

1124
01:27:03,453 --> 01:27:07,357
What makes a job desirable, Rick,
isn't just the dollar amount attached to it.

1125
01:27:07,457 --> 01:27:11,060
You're at the ground floor of a
growing business. Your reward is a career.

1126
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:14,564
Fuck that. You're talking about
some seriously messed-up shit.

1127
01:27:14,664 --> 01:27:18,735
You're just expecting me to just
go along with it. I want more.

1128
01:27:18,935 --> 01:27:21,738
I can't make people do things, Rick.
You have a choice if you wanna do this.

1129
01:27:21,838 --> 01:27:23,601
And I have a choice if you don't.

1130
01:27:25,642 --> 01:27:27,175
Are you threatening to fire me?

1131
01:27:28,144 --> 01:27:31,281
Hey, I... I got something, too.
How about not calling in criminals,

1132
01:27:31,381 --> 01:27:34,985
waiting for them to start some shit so you
can film it? That's against the fucking law.

1133
01:27:35,485 --> 01:27:38,788
Yeah, cops would be majorly
interested in that, no doubt.

1134
01:27:38,888 --> 01:27:41,656
Okay? So, I... I want more money.

1135
01:27:44,894 --> 01:27:46,861
We can re-open negotiations, Rick.

1136
01:27:47,697 --> 01:27:52,669
But, remember, when it comes to your
work reputation, you can't un-ring the bell.

1137
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:55,370
I want half of whatever we make tonight.

1138
01:27:56,706 --> 01:27:58,372
How did you arrive at that number?

1139
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:03,246
There's two of us out here. So, 50-50.

1140
01:28:03,346 --> 01:28:05,315
I'll counter at $10,000.

1141
01:28:05,415 --> 01:28:09,650
You don't set the numbers on this.
I want half. I want half.

1142
01:28:10,687 --> 01:28:13,788
If you're saying I can't negotiate,
then I guess I'm...

1143
01:28:21,264 --> 01:28:23,731
I'm just gonna have to give it to you.

1144
01:28:26,703 --> 01:28:28,705
Well, all right, then.

1145
01:28:29,906 --> 01:28:34,608
Now I can feel good about it, at least.
Now, I'll go the extra mile.

1146
01:28:35,245 --> 01:28:38,446
That's what you never understood, man.
It's been the problem the whole time.

1147
01:28:41,017 --> 01:28:42,819
You gotta bring people in, Lou.
Seriously.

1148
01:28:42,919 --> 01:28:45,789
You gotta talk to them like
they're fucking human beings.

1149
01:28:45,889 --> 01:28:49,693
I'm saying this for you, dude.
For the future, to help you.

1150
01:28:49,793 --> 01:28:52,470
Because you got a seriously
weird-ass way of looking at shit.

1151
01:28:53,596 --> 01:28:55,458
You know you do!

1152
01:28:56,099 --> 01:28:59,355
You know what your trouble is, man?
You don't fucking understand people.

1153
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:02,770
Okay?

1154
01:29:05,675 --> 01:29:07,642
I'll take the first watch.

1155
01:29:08,845 --> 01:29:10,378
Okay.

1156
01:29:34,571 --> 01:29:36,243
Rise and shine.

1157
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,641
He's leaving.

1158
01:29:41,778 --> 01:29:44,578
- Is that him?
- That's one of them.

1159
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:29,225
You're too fucking close, man.

1160
01:30:29,525 --> 01:30:31,059
Oh, shit.

1161
01:30:32,395 --> 01:30:33,496
You're too fucking close.

1162
01:30:33,596 --> 01:30:37,565
This guy might have already seen us,
and he's bringing us here as a trap.

1163
01:30:39,068 --> 01:30:40,801
You ever think of that?

1164
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:46,474
Oh, shit.

1165
01:31:25,748 --> 01:31:29,049
They're gonna see us.
We're in a red fucking car.

1166
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,588
Lower your window, please.

1167
01:32:03,052 --> 01:32:06,187
- Keep your window down.
- I'm fucking cold.

1168
01:32:16,099 --> 01:32:17,665
Shit, they're parking.

1169
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:20,034
Keep going.

1170
01:32:38,154 --> 01:32:39,555
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

1171
01:32:39,655 --> 01:32:42,258
Yes, good evening. Hello?
I'd like to report the location of two men

1172
01:32:42,358 --> 01:32:45,528
responsible for the triple murder
in Granada Hills last night.

1173
01:32:45,828 --> 01:32:47,565
- <i>What's your address?</i>
- I followed them,

1174
01:32:47,665 --> 01:32:50,733
and they just pulled into the Chinatown
Express at Western and Third.

1175
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:52,569
I can see them inside.

1176
01:32:52,669 --> 01:32:56,072
<i>Okay, it's a restaurant called
Chinatown Express at Western and Third.</i>

1177
01:32:56,172 --> 01:32:58,541
That's right. I can see them at
the counter and they're ordering.

1178
01:32:58,641 --> 01:33:00,910
These men are wanted for the triple
murder in Granada Hills last night.

1179
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:03,079
<i>- What's your name, sir?</i>
- Louis Bloom.

1180
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:04,814
<i>Do you have a description of the men?</i>

1181
01:33:04,914 --> 01:33:06,649
Yes, I do.
They're both Latin American men.

1182
01:33:06,749 --> 01:33:09,419
Probably what you would call Hispanic.

1183
01:33:09,519 --> 01:33:12,355
One is big, very much on the heavy side.

1184
01:33:12,455 --> 01:33:15,424
And the other's face is scratched.
He has scratches on his face.

1185
01:33:15,524 --> 01:33:16,594
<i>How old are the men?</i>

1186
01:33:17,627 --> 01:33:21,431
Thirty. Perhaps, maybe, 35.

1187
01:33:21,631 --> 01:33:23,366
<i>What are they wearing?</i>

1188
01:33:23,466 --> 01:33:25,602
The big man is wearing light
pants and a striped sweater,

1189
01:33:25,702 --> 01:33:28,304
and the man with scratches is
wearing brown pants and a vest.

1190
01:33:28,404 --> 01:33:31,371
He looks like he has a... gun.

1191
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:33,343
<i>You said the suspect is armed?</i>

1192
01:33:33,443 --> 01:33:37,111
I believe so, yes. I'm sorry, I have to go.
Otherwise, they might see me.

1193
01:33:49,325 --> 01:33:52,127
<i>All west units, possible 187.
Suspects there now.</i>

1194
01:33:52,227 --> 01:33:55,231
<i>Western and Third.
Western and Third at Chinatown Express.</i>

1195
01:33:55,331 --> 01:33:58,151
<i>Suspects are two male Hispanics.
Number one, large build.</i>

1196
01:33:58,251 --> 01:34:01,788
<i>Number two with scratches on his face,
inside the location. Possibly armed.</i>

1197
01:34:01,888 --> 01:34:05,308
<i>Code Three, incident 357 and 9753.</i>

1198
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:07,877
There's fucking people in there.

1199
01:34:07,977 --> 01:34:11,314
- I count six.
- Oh, shit!

1200
01:34:11,414 --> 01:34:13,751
So, they could start shooting.

1201
01:34:14,417 --> 01:34:15,302
They could.

1202
01:34:15,402 --> 01:34:18,387
So you said we were waiting for a
better neighborhood with more people,

1203
01:34:18,487 --> 01:34:20,740
- not a fucking restaurant.
- We work with what we're given.

1204
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,792
<i>Unit 14, responding to that Code Three.</i>

1205
01:34:22,892 --> 01:34:26,126
You're going to go down the street,
get an angle inside from over there.

1206
01:34:27,229 --> 01:34:31,868
Steady hands. Use the zoom.
No fast pans. I'll be filming from here.

1207
01:34:31,968 --> 01:34:34,568
Fuck that. I'm not
getting out of the car!

1208
01:34:36,806 --> 01:34:40,409
I need a second angle from down
the street. We'll cut it together.

1209
01:34:40,509 --> 01:34:44,447
Two angles. Believe me,
it's more dangerous here in the car.

1210
01:34:44,547 --> 01:34:48,351
I don't believe anything you say.
Man, this is fucked!

1211
01:34:48,951 --> 01:34:51,554
Do you know I've never once
sworn in front of an employer?

1212
01:34:51,654 --> 01:34:54,457
I am not doing it!
I'm not getting out of the car.

1213
01:34:54,757 --> 01:34:56,392
You're making a mistake.

1214
01:34:56,492 --> 01:34:59,860
I don't care about
the fucking job title.

1215
01:35:04,967 --> 01:35:09,203
What if my problem wasn't that I don't
understand people, but that I don't like them?

1216
01:35:12,008 --> 01:35:15,476
What if I was obliged to hurt you
for something like this?

1217
01:35:16,946 --> 01:35:18,512
I mean, physically.

1218
01:35:20,183 --> 01:35:25,021
I think you'd have to believe afterwards,
if you could, that agreeing to participate

1219
01:35:25,121 --> 01:35:28,458
and then backing out at the
critical moment was a mistake.

1220
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:30,665
Because that's what I'm telling you.

1221
01:35:33,996 --> 01:35:37,667
As clearly...

1222
01:35:38,345 --> 01:35:40,049
as I can.

1223
01:36:59,115 --> 01:37:02,182
<i>7-A-14. We're Code Six to location.</i>

1224
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:08,856
<i>7-A-21. Show us backing 7-A-14.</i>

1225
01:38:05,714 --> 01:38:07,429
Oh, God.

1226
01:38:16,525 --> 01:38:19,092
<i>7-A-21. We're Code Six with 7-A-14.</i>

1227
01:38:38,147 --> 01:38:39,880
Oh, God.

1228
01:38:41,383 --> 01:38:43,017
Oh, God.

1229
01:38:50,993 --> 01:38:52,059
Gun!

1230
01:38:53,529 --> 01:38:55,498
Oh, God! Oh, fuck!

1231
01:38:56,198 --> 01:38:58,297
We have a gun! Two of them!

1232
01:39:00,021 --> 01:39:00,970
Call it in!

1233
01:39:01,070 --> 01:39:04,006
<i>Shots fired. Shots fired.
Officer down. Officer needs help.</i>

1234
01:39:05,241 --> 01:39:07,407
One's down! In pursuit!

1235
01:39:08,344 --> 01:39:09,645
Go, go, go!

1236
01:39:19,822 --> 01:39:23,326
<i>Suspect leaving in a black Escalade
and out of the location, heading north.</i>

1237
01:39:23,626 --> 01:39:26,229
- Fuck!
- Did you get it?

1238
01:39:26,329 --> 01:39:28,131
There's people dead in there!

1239
01:39:28,931 --> 01:39:31,565
<i>7-A-27. I'm behind vehicle,
we are in pursuit.</i>

1240
01:39:33,235 --> 01:39:35,304
<i>7-A-27, roger.</i>

1241
01:39:35,404 --> 01:39:38,641
- <i>All units at all frequencies, stand by.</i>
- Aim the camera at the car and start filming.

1242
01:39:38,741 --> 01:39:41,911
<i>7-A-27 in pursuit,

<i>Suspect vehicle is a black Escalade.</i>

1244
01:39:46,115 --> 01:39:48,248
Rick, start filming!

1245
01:39:56,025 --> 01:39:58,227
<i>7-A-27. We just turned
northbound on Western.</i>

1246
01:39:58,327 --> 01:40:00,897
- Stay on the police car.
- You're right up his ass.

1247
01:40:01,597 --> 01:40:03,232
Wide angle. We want all of this.

1248

<i>Requesting backup and an air unit.</i>

<i>Any air unit, come in

<i>Northbound. 70 miles an hour.

Steady hands, Rick.

1253
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:20,383
It's a red light! It's a red light!
Red light!

<i>...approaching a red light.</i>

<i>No acknowledgment from 7-A-27.</i>

1266

He's dead. Get this shot.

1280
01:42:24,206 --> 01:42:25,639
Steady hands.

1281
01:42:30,879 --> 01:42:32,709
Use your zoom.

1282
01:43:06,782 --> 01:43:08,784
Hold it right there! Put the gun down!

1283
01:43:24,433 --> 01:43:26,068
He had a weapon. That was a just fire.

1284
01:43:26,168 --> 01:43:27,406
He's not moving.

1285
01:43:32,841 --> 01:43:34,342
Let's seal this off.

1286
01:43:38,314 --> 01:43:39,980
You saw him.

You saw him!

1288
01:43:47,756 --> 01:43:52,394
I can't jeopardize my company's success

1290

You're crazy!

1292
01:44:05,274 --> 01:44:09,678
You took my bargaining power, Rick.
You used it against me.

1293
01:44:09,778 --> 01:44:12,546
You would have done it again.
Just admit it.

1294
01:44:14,950 --> 01:44:16,483
I don't know.

1295
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:19,886
I don't know.

01:44:20,489 --> 01:44:22,022
I know.

1297
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:26,459
I know.

1298
01:44:33,869 --> 01:44:37,370
Don't touch that unless it's for prints.
Make a clean sweep.

1299
01:44:40,108 --> 01:44:41,984
Go around the vehicle.

1300
01:44:46,181 --> 01:44:48,348
Let them through, here they come.

1301
01:45:07,569 --> 01:45:09,374
Hello, Juliana.

01:45:10,606 --> 01:45:12,105
Hello, Willy.

1303
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:19,648
- Hello, Ben. Hello, Lisa.
- Hi!

1304
01:45:19,748 --> 01:45:22,017
- Hey. It's Lou, right?
- Yes, that's right!

1305
01:45:22,117 --> 01:45:23,419
- Video News?
- That's right.

1306
01:45:23,519 --> 01:45:25,343
- You got something good for us tonight?
- I think so.

1307
01:45:25,443 --> 01:45:29,658
I'm about to show Nina right now.
I can tell by your tie, it's Friday.

1308
01:46:07,763 --> 01:46:09,529
You can leave.

1309
01:46:19,408 --> 01:46:21,602
Wasn't that your partner?

1310
01:46:22,911 --> 01:46:25,260
As a matter of fact, that's him.

1311
01:46:27,249 --> 01:46:29,382
Oh, I'm floored.

1312
01:46:30,018 --> 01:46:32,740
I mean, it's amazing.

1313
01:46:33,188 --> 01:46:34,861
Thank you.

1314
01:46:35,457 --> 01:46:39,058
I mean, just amazing.

1315
01:46:40,562 --> 01:46:42,197
Thank you.

1316
01:46:42,297 --> 01:46:44,304
No, thank you.

1317
01:46:45,434 --> 01:46:47,856
Thank you for bringing it to me.

1318
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:50,503
You're welcome.

1319
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:55,909
- I want it, obviously.
- How much do you want it?

1320
01:46:57,646 --> 01:46:59,479
You tell me.

1321
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:03,585
Get this to graphics.

1322
01:47:03,685 --> 01:47:05,788
- Who's in charge here?
- Who are you?

1323
01:47:05,888 --> 01:47:09,024
LAPD. Major case.
Pull the footage from these screens.

1324
01:47:09,124 --> 01:47:11,527
- Round it up. Let's go. All copies.
- Excuse me.

1325
01:47:12,227 --> 01:47:14,496
I'm the news director. Can I help you?

1326
01:47:14,596 --> 01:47:16,932
You can help yourself by collecting up
every copy of the shootout

1327
01:47:17,032 --> 01:47:20,569
- the chase, the crash, all of it. Now.
- It's KWLA property.

1328
01:47:20,669 --> 01:47:22,404
- It's evidence.
- Of what?

1329
01:47:22,504 --> 01:47:26,508
I got a cop near death in the hospital,
three dead, four wounded,

1330
01:47:26,608 --> 01:47:30,045
and a dozen major crimes stretching
a mile of Third. This tape is evidence.

1331
01:47:30,245 --> 01:47:33,315
It's news footage bought and paid for
from an independent contractor.

1332
01:47:33,415 --> 01:47:34,583
And how do you think he got it?

1333
01:47:34,683 --> 01:47:37,319
- If there's an issue, speak to him.
- Don't get in the way of this.

1334
01:47:37,419 --> 01:47:40,055
Unless you have a judge's order,
we're going with it in four minutes.

1335
01:47:40,355 --> 01:47:43,159
Hey. Isn't that him?

1336
01:47:47,996 --> 01:47:50,002
Camera One, stay centered up.

1337
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,933
Camera Two, we'll do a
zoom out when we come out.

1338
01:47:55,237 --> 01:47:56,822
Joel has got a source on the taskforce

1339
01:47:56,922 --> 01:47:59,542
who says they found drugs
at the Granada Hills house.

1340
01:47:59,642 --> 01:48:03,245
Cocaine in wrapped packages hidden
in crawlspaces. Over 50 pounds.

1341
01:48:03,345 --> 01:48:06,148
And he confirmed it with an
investigator at the scene.

1342
01:48:06,248 --> 01:48:08,951
It wasn't a home invasion.
It was a drug robbery.

1343
01:48:09,051 --> 01:48:10,861
Give it to the noon crew.

1344
01:48:11,887 --> 01:48:14,190
- This is news.
- It detracts from the story.

1345
01:48:14,290 --> 01:48:16,158
It is the story.

1346
01:48:16,258 --> 01:48:20,530
The story is urban crime creeping
into the suburbs. That's the story.

1347
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:24,366
- Jesus, you sound like Lou.
- Ten seconds to back.

1348
01:48:24,466 --> 01:48:28,137
I think Lou is inspiring all
of us to reach a little higher.

1349
01:48:28,237 --> 01:48:31,087
Five, four, three,

1350
01:48:31,187 --> 01:48:33,548
two, one. Sting it.

1351
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:37,477
Mics. Dissolve.

1352
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:52,427
You understand that you've been read
your rights, and you're here voluntarily?

1353
01:48:52,527 --> 01:48:54,471
That's right. Yes.

1354
01:48:55,163 --> 01:48:57,300
And this is being recorded and filmed?

1355
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,166
<i>Yes, from the camera up there.</i>

1356
01:49:00,569 --> 01:49:02,770
<i>Wide angle.</i>

1357
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:10,312
Would you tell me how it is you were
at the Chinatown Express tonight

1358
01:49:10,412 --> 01:49:11,880
and called the 911?

1359
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:15,114
Of course. It began earlier in the day.

1360
01:49:16,184 --> 01:49:18,189
I was watering my plant.

1361
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:21,757
I looked out my window at my apartment.

1362
01:49:21,857 --> 01:49:24,827
The one you visited. And...

1363
01:49:24,927 --> 01:49:28,130
I saw a dark-colored vehicle with two
men inside parked across the street.

1364
01:49:28,230 --> 01:49:30,537
I didn't think anything of it,
otherwise I would have reported it then.

1365
01:49:32,234 --> 01:49:35,292
We began our night, my...

1366
01:49:37,372 --> 01:49:39,908
employee and myself.

1367
01:49:40,008 --> 01:49:43,011
And around approximately 12:38,

1368
01:49:43,111 --> 01:49:47,215
I looked in my rearview mirror and I
saw what looked like the same men

1369
01:49:47,315 --> 01:49:50,686
in the same vehicle following us.
I made an evasive maneuver.

1370
01:49:50,786 --> 01:49:53,689
I circled back and tailed
them to the restaurant.

1371
01:49:53,789 --> 01:49:55,869
At which point, I saw them
go inside and recognized them

1372
01:49:55,969 --> 01:49:58,474
as the same men from the home invasion.

1373
01:49:59,327 --> 01:50:02,798
You told me you didn't see the men.
That you didn't get a good look at them.

1374
01:50:03,098 --> 01:50:06,168
Well, it all came back to me
when I saw them going in.

1375
01:50:06,268 --> 01:50:09,438
Their shapes and their movements.

1376
01:50:09,538 --> 01:50:11,974
And then I saw that one of the men
had a gun under his shirt,

1377
01:50:12,074 --> 01:50:15,243
so I immediately got my
phone and dialed 911.

1378
01:50:15,343 --> 01:50:16,478
That's your story?

1379
01:50:16,578 --> 01:50:18,947
That's what happened.
That's why I'm sitting here with you.

1380
01:50:19,047 --> 01:50:22,384
I think that the men
saw my footage and...

1381
01:50:22,484 --> 01:50:24,687
they tracked me down.

1382
01:50:24,987 --> 01:50:27,120
You want to know what I think?

1383
01:50:28,123 --> 01:50:30,125
Yes, please.

1384
01:50:30,325 --> 01:50:33,079
I think you withheld information.

1385
01:50:33,562 --> 01:50:36,598
I think you saw the two men in
the murder house in Granada Hills

1386
01:50:36,698 --> 01:50:40,536
and you saw the car and you sat on it

1387
01:50:40,836 --> 01:50:43,005
to get something you could film.

1388
01:50:43,405 --> 01:50:45,471
What do you think about that?

1389
01:50:47,008 --> 01:50:49,011
I think that would be...

1390
01:50:49,111 --> 01:50:51,813
a very unprofessional thing
for me to do in my business.

1391
01:50:51,913 --> 01:50:53,982
It would be murder.

1392
01:50:54,282 --> 01:50:57,019
I can understand why you're looking into it,
but I didn't do anything like that.

1393
01:50:57,119 --> 01:51:00,899
- Nothing that could be considered wrong.
- You don't fool me for a minute.

1394
01:51:00,999 --> 01:51:05,327
- I'm glad.
- I think everything you said is a lie.

1395
01:51:05,727 --> 01:51:07,779
I wish my partner was here
to back up what happened.

1396
01:51:07,879 --> 01:51:09,498
You left your dead partner.

1397
01:51:09,598 --> 01:51:12,334
No, the ambulances arrived.
They're trained professionals.

1398
01:51:12,434 --> 01:51:14,832
Yeah, and you seem real
broken up about that.

1399
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:16,505
No...

1400
01:51:16,705 --> 01:51:19,038
He died doing what he loved.

1401
01:51:20,075 --> 01:51:22,912
You filmed him dying.

1402
01:51:24,513 --> 01:51:26,682
<i>Yeah. That's what I do. It's my job.</i>

1403
01:51:26,782 --> 01:51:30,383
<i>I like to say that if you're seeing me,
you're having the worst day of your life.</i>

1404
01:52:03,151 --> 01:52:06,455
<i>Any Rampart unit, ambulance to
11 Rampart on Second Avenue.</i>

1405
01:52:06,555 --> 01:52:09,255
<i>Victim, female, white.
Unknown property taken.</i>

1406
01:52:28,109 --> 01:52:29,742
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1407
01:52:31,947 --> 01:52:34,051
Congratulations.

1408
01:52:34,883 --> 01:52:38,486
Your selection by Video Production News is
evidence of the hiring committee's recognition

1409
01:52:38,586 --> 01:52:41,824
of your employment history
and unique personal qualities.

1410
01:52:42,324 --> 01:52:44,426
It is my hope that through
hard work and commitment,

1411
01:52:44,526 --> 01:52:48,530
you will move through the intern program
and continue to pursue your career goals

1412
01:52:48,630 --> 01:52:52,400
as full-time employees
of Video Production News.

1413
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:55,685
I can tell you from experience
that the surest way up the ladder

1414
01:52:55,785 --> 01:52:59,575
is to listen carefully
and follow my orders.

1415
01:53:00,075 --> 01:53:03,845
You may be confused at times,
and other times, unsure.

1416
01:53:03,945 --> 01:53:05,745
But remember,

1417
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:09,114
I will never ask you to do anything

1418
01:53:09,484 --> 01:53:12,018
that I wouldn't do myself.
