00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,634
<font color=#FFFF2D>Dr. Donnelly, you cool?</font>

270
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:40,872
<font color=#FFFF2D>yeah!</font>

271
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,510
<font color=#FFFF2D>Holy fuck!</font>

272
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:52,681
<font color=#FFFF2D>We go down in there,</font>

273
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:54,918
<font color=#FFFF2D>You can start your job.</font>

274
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,760
<font color=#FFFF2D>- ok.
- ok.</font>

275
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:01,121
<font color=#FFFF2D>- Everybody, move up.
- Alpha Team in position.</font>

276
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:04,337
<font color=#FFFF2D>We're on the move.</font>

<font color=#26F70F>(Breathing heavily)</font>

281
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:30,781
What happens now?

282
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:34,602
They'll arrive.

<font color=#26F70F>(Aliens approaching)</font>

284
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,193
Dr. Banks?

285
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:46,836
Dr. Banks?

286
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:49,629
You can start.

287
00:32:56,229 --> 00:32:58,029
<font color=#26F70F>(Voice on comms)</font>

288
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:10,319
Wait... Just a minute.

289
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:32,884
I'm fired?

290
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,422
You were better than the last guy.

291
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,910
That does not make me feel any better.

292
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:42,741
You have till 0200 hours
to think something up.

293
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:44,736
And what happens then?

294
00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:46,710
You go back in.

295
00:33:56,174 --> 00:33:58,474
<font color=#26F70F>(Recording plays of alien conversation)</font>

296
00:34:20,774 --> 00:34:25,760
Violence continues to spread across the US
today ******.

297
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:29,003
The President has declared
a mandatory dusk to dawn curfew

298
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,853
after the crack down by the National Guard

299
00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:34,036
Failed to prevent a third night
of looting across the country.

300
00:34:34,037 --> 00:34:38,236
In North Dakota, 144 members of
the St. Lawrence Pentecostal occult

301
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:41,821
Are feared dead after they
set their compound ablaze.

302
00:34:41,822 --> 00:34:44,213
Their website claims, the arrival of aliens

303
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:46,972
Set in motion a prophecy that 12...

<font color=#26F70F>(Indiscernible audio on radio)</font>

305
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:09,509
Uh.. we're up in 15...
You got any new intel?

306
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,233
Yeah. We've been playing back
some of their sounds...

307
00:35:12,922 --> 00:35:14,362
And where has that got you?

308
00:35:14,795 --> 00:35:18,051
When they play audio back at us.
Its from an unseen source

309
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:20,282
What are you up with?

310
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:24,416
Conversations from inside the
room. Branches of dialogue.

311
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:27,973
We have nothing.

312
00:35:58,097 --> 00:36:01,597
<font color=#26F70F>(Voice on comms)</font>

313
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:05,812
- Whats that for?
- Visual aid.

314
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:09,068
Look, I'm never going to
be able to speak their words,

315
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:10,720
if they aren't talking.

316
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,669
But they might have some sort of
written language

317
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,082
or basis for visual communication.

318
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,185
Ok. Let's start.

319
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,429
<font color=#26F70F>(Scribbling "HUMAN" on board)</font>

320
00:36:28,429 --> 00:36:30,063
Human.

321
00:36:57,442 --> 00:36:59,138
Human.

322
00:37:02,212 --> 00:37:04,004
I'm human.

323
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:06,792
And you?

324
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,750
Human.

325
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,140
<font color=#26F70F>(Bird fluttering in its cage)</font>

326
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,068
- Oh my God.
- Are you recording this?

327
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:14,224
Yes sir. I have sent this to base.

328
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:18,772
Louise, its incredible!

329
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:35,201
Human.

330
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:38,272
Human.

331
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:40,974
Human.

332
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:55,000
Okay... Slow down Louise.

333
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,571
I don't want to take away from your success,

334
00:39:16,572 --> 00:39:19,677
but Dr. Banks,
is it really the right approach?

335
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:22,702
Try to teach them
how to speak and read?

336
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:25,680
- Thats gonna take long.
- You're wrong!

337
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:27,771
Its faster.

338
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:31,510
Everything you do here,

339
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,882
I have to explain to a
room full of men,

340
00:39:33,883 --> 00:39:35,765
whose first and last question

341
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:37,731
Is how can this be used against us.

342
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,006
So you'll have to give me more than that!

343
00:39:41,998 --> 00:39:43,835
Kangaroo.

344
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,653
What is that?

345
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,745
In 1770,

346
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:50,237
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

347
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:52,563
off the coast of Australia and led a party,

348
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:54,607
where they found the aboriginal people.

349
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:56,933
One of the sailors pointed to the animals

350
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:59,623
that hop around and
put their babies in their pouch,

351
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:03,184
And he asked what they were.
The Aborigines said "kangaroo".

352
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,262
And your point is?

353
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:09,486
It wasn't until later that they learned
that "kangaroo" means

354
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,879
"I don't understand". So...

355
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,449
I need this so that
we don't misinterpret things in there,

356
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,660
otherwise it is going to take 10 times
as long.

357
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:20,912
I can sell that for now.

358
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,131
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary of words

359
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:25,650
before the next session.

360
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,120
Remember what happened to the Aborigines.

361
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:32,902
A more advanced race,
nearly wiped them out.

362
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,783
- Its a good story.
- Thanks.

363
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:48,041
Its not true, but it proves my point.

364
00:40:58,686 --> 00:41:01,686
HUMAN?

365
00:41:05,956 --> 00:41:10,412
I think we can present some
prime numbers here.

366
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:13,889
- It's something.
- Congratulations, you're a parrot.

367
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,969
Its a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard. Dont you see?

368
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,678
They can't seem to follow our algebra.

369
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,252
But complex behaviours - that clears.

370
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,839
That does not make any sense, does it?

371
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:36,042
Problem is, not everyone shares

372
00:41:36,043 --> 00:41:38,343
our policy of being open with the aliens.

373
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:40,344
That is Gen. Shang.

374
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:43,132
It is gathering strength in Shanghai

375
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,765
and at least four other nations
would follow him.

376
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:49,109
- Louise, we need get ground today.
- ok.

377
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,891
- You have the vocabulary for me?
- I do.

378
00:41:57,196 --> 00:42:00,597
You're gonna teach them your name
and Ian's?

379
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:03,515
Yes, so that we can learn their names,
if they have names,

380
00:42:03,516 --> 00:42:05,536
and then introduce pronouns later.

381
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,293
These are grade school words.

382
00:42:08,294 --> 00:42:10,694
Eating, walking.

383
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:13,961
Help me understand.

384
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,597
No no no! Not the top!

385
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:26,097
"What is your purpose on Earth?"

386
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:29,382
Ok, this is where you want to get to, right?

387
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:30,783
- That is the question.
- Right.

388
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:35,383
So, first we need to make sure that
they understand what a question is.

389
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:39,620
The nature of our request for information

390
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:41,142
on the response.

391
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:44,121
Then we need to clarify

392
00:42:44,122 --> 00:42:46,839
the difference between a specific "you"...

393
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,606
and a collective "you".

394
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:53,106
We don't want to know why
a 'Joe' alien is here,

395
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:55,923
we want to know why they all landed.

396
00:42:55,924 --> 00:42:59,433
A purpose requires an understanding
of intent.

397
00:42:59,434 --> 00:43:02,183
We need to find out do they make
conscious choices,

398
00:43:02,184 --> 00:43:04,617
or is the motivation so instinctive

399
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:07,412
that they don't understand
any why "?"question at all.

400
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:11,620
And biggest of all we need to have
enough vocabulary with them,

401
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,515
that we understand their answer.

402
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:17,273
Yeah.

403
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:19,610
Stick to your list.

404
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:21,852
Just...

405
00:43:23,316 --> 00:43:25,045
Don't add anything to it.

406
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,887
Let's get started.

407
00:43:52,187 --> 00:43:54,187
<font color=#26F70F>(Scribbling on the board)</font>

408
00:43:56,187 --> 00:43:58,787
<font color=#26F70F>(closes pen)</font>

409
00:43:59,977 --> 00:44:01,663
Louise.

410
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,155
Louise, I'm Louise.

411
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:12,801
What is that?

412
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:16,843
Is that a new symbol?
I can't tell.

413
00:44:16,844 --> 00:44:19,496
I don't know,
I think its the symbol for "human" again.

414
00:44:19,497 --> 00:44:21,915
But with a curl at the end.

415
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:25,085
Maybe they indicate a question.
I don't know.

416
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,291
I do not know, Louise,
I think they are confused.

417
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:32,480
Dr. Banks, move to the next word.

418
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,281
Dr. Banks!

419
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:56,581
- Its okay.
- Whats going on?

420
00:44:56,582 --> 00:44:58,178
What are you doing?

421
00:44:58,586 --> 00:45:00,484
- Im fine.
- Are you crazy?

422
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,549
They need to see me.

423
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,563
She's taking off protection.
Dr. Banks!

424
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:10,197
Are you ok?
You are at risk of contamination.

425
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:12,805
- They need to see me.
- Dr. Banks.

426
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,640
- Dr. Banks.
- She's going upto the screen.

427
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:20,813
Should we abort?

428
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:25,551
Go back to your stations.

429
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:08,158
Ominous music plays

430
00:46:40,158 --> 00:46:42,619
Now that's a proper introduction.

431
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:56,763
Louise.

432
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,414
I'm Louise.

433
00:47:01,415 --> 00:47:04,250
Ian, you want to introduce yourself?

434
00:47:06,986 --> 00:47:09,314
I...

435
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,660
Louise.

436
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,591
(Screw it?)

437
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:25,980
Everyone dies one day, right?

438
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,735
Sir, Donnelly is taking off his suit too.

439
00:47:30,736 --> 00:47:32,254
Permission to abort?

440
00:47:32,964 --> 00:47:34,848
Continue with the session.

441
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:52,551
Ian.

442
00:47:52,552 --> 00:47:54,460
Louise.

443
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:56,960
You?

444
00:47:58,284 --> 00:48:00,085
Who are you?

445
00:48:27,256 --> 00:48:29,237
I think those are their names.

446
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:34,232
They have names.

447
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,474
So what are we gonna call them?

448
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,919
I do not know.

449
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:42,163
I was thinking of Abbott and Costello.

450
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:46,562
Yeah.

451
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:48,659
I like it.

452
00:48:50,752 --> 00:48:52,199
I like it.

453
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:06,726
<font color=#26F70F>(vehicle approaches)</font>

454
00:49:08,026 --> 00:49:11,792
Vehicle One, exit your vehicles
and proceed to the decontamination camp.

455
00:49:17,842 --> 00:49:22,209
Do not take the masks.

456
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,149
Not to withdraw their masks,

457
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:10,200
and adhere to the decontamination room.

458
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,240
- How do you feel?
- Overworked.

459
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,500
Like I said, I need to tell you,
you put yourself at risk.

460
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,800
There is no signs of radiation poisoning...
yet.

461
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:27,960
I'll check your blood.

462
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,680
- For now, Im gonna give you another boost.
- ok.

463
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,940
- No radiation?
- Nothing else we can detect either.

464
00:50:35,941 --> 00:50:37,940
But I will still give her a strong
cocktail, regardless.

465
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:40,620
It was the first time we made
significant progress.

466
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,780
Alright. We'll take the risk.

467
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,740
- Honey...honey.
- What's going on?

468
00:50:49,741 --> 00:50:52,859
- Can you tell me something?
- No.

469
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,920
- You are worried.
- How can I not worry?

470
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:58,320
Calm down.

471
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,299
Becky asked if the monsters
are going to kill Dad.

472
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,800
Honey, its not gonna happen.

473
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,300
- Come soon, please.
- No need to worry.

474
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:12,820
I'm so scared.

475
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:23,460
music playing

476
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,160
Here are some of the many things

477
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:30,200
we don't know about the heptopodes.

478
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:33,420
Greek: Hepta seven. Pod foot.

479
00:52:33,421 --> 00:52:36,160
Seven feet. Heptápode.

480
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,260
Who are they?

481
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,679
Trying to answer this in any meaningful
way is hampered by the fact that,

482
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,400
outside of being able to see them
and hear them,

483
00:52:47,401 --> 00:52:50,320
They have deposited absolutely no footprint.

484
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,060
The chemical composition of their
spaceship is unknown.

485
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,000
The Shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.

486
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,220
Assuming that the ships
communicate with each other,

487
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,480
they do so without detection.

488
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,909
The air between the shells is controlled

489
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,240
by sonic emissions or light waves.

490
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,979
They are scientists or tourists?

491
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,540
If scientists,
they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

492
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,320
Why they land in these places?

493
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,760
The world's most decorated experts
can not figure that out.

494
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,540
The most plausible theory is that
they chose places on earth

495
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,940
With the lowest incidences of
lightning strikes.

496
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,379
But there are exceptions.

497
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,120
The second most plausible theory
is that Sheena Easton

498
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:39,598
Had a hit song in each of
these sites in 1980.

499
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,580
So... we just don't know.

500
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,560
How do they communicate?

501
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,940
Here, Louise has brought us all to shame.

502
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,299
The first breakthrough was discovering
that there is no co-relation

503
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,220
between what a heptápode says,
and what a heptápode writes.

504
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:06,429
IAN YOU

505
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,280
Unlike all human written language,

506
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:17,539
their writing is semasiográfica.

507
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,820
It conveyes meaning,
it does not represent sound.

508
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:29,740
Perhaps they view our form of writing
as a wasted oppurtunity,

509
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,860
Passing every second
communication's channel.

510
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,320
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank

511
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:42,840
For their study on how the
heptápodes write.

512
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,739
Because unlike speech,

513
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,940
a hologram is free of time.

514
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,560
Like their ship
or their bodies.

515
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:56,840
their written language has no form
or no direction.

516
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,640
Linguists call this nonlinear orthography.

517
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:04,060
Which raises the question:
"Is this how they think?"

518
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,040
Imagine you wanted to write a sentence

519
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,380
using 2 hands, starting from either side.

520
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,220
You have to know each word
you wanted to use,

521
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:16,900
as well as how much space they will occupy.

522
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,440
A heptápode can write a complex sentence

523
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:23,439
in two seconds effortlessly.

524
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,400
It took us a month to make
the simplest vocabulary.

525
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,839
Next, explain the vocabulary.

526
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,440
Louise thinks it will easily take
another month to get ready for that.

527
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,960
Hey.

528
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,120
- Hi.
- Weber's looking for you.

529
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,580
Why do you think I'm hiding out here?

530
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,480
C'mon up.

531
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,060
- Nice out here, huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice view.

532
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,760
Away from the noise.

533
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,280
You know, I was just thinking about you.

534
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,320
You approach language like a
mathematician. You know that right?

535
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,119
I will take that as a compliment.

536
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,960
But it is.

537
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,200
And... I want you to

538
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:39,740
Steer us around these communication traps

539
00:56:39,741 --> 00:56:41,759
that I did not even know existed.

540
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,300
What...?

541
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,440
I guess this is why I'm still single.

542
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:50,780
Trust me, you can understand communication

543
00:56:50,781 --> 00:56:52,460
and still end up single.

544
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,340
I feel like everything
that happens there...

545
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,240
It comes down to the 2 of us.

546
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,100
It's a good thing, alright? You and I?

547
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,460
See those jokers that
we are working with?

548
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,860
Thank God, I got you.

549
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:27,703
<b><font color=#C752ED>ALIEN CRISIS | DAY 25 VENEZUELA</font></b>

550
00:57:30,721 --> 00:57:32,460
<b><font color=#C752ED>UNITED KINGDOM SAVE OUR SPECIES!</font></b>

551
00:57:32,461 --> 00:57:36,040
Tonight, the first photo of the aliens
goes viral.

552
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,540
Biological contamination is a
major risk factor

553
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:43,200
At the Montana site. So say environmental
pressure groups.

554
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:45,420
800,000 march on Washington

555
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:48,180
to protest the government's handling
on the crisis.

556
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,880
All this and more, special coverage.

557
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,180
First contact was inside that thing.

558
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,760
Who's in charge? The government, of course.

559
00:57:57,761 --> 00:58:01,740
The same government who ruined our
backyard and bankrupted our military.

560
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:05,039
Look at these people.
Most of them don't even have guns.

561
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,220
We could be facing a full scale
invasion invasion.

562
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:10,960
Our President is willing to sit back,
and let them overtake the country.

563
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:13,680
We are falling asleep at the wheel, people!

564
00:58:13,681 --> 00:58:15,680
You know what Im talking about!

565
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:20,060
The smartest thing to do right now,
would be a show of force.

566
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:22,060
I'm talking about a shot across the brow.

567
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:25,920
I want to know what you think
about all this.

568
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,940
whats this word?

569
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,760
Green Planet...

570
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,400
The Earth is a planet.

571
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,760
Want to see my project
for Miss. Garrett's class?

572
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,660
Of course, little nose.

573
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,200
We had to make up our own TV show.

574
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,640
If we had one.

575
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,180
- Who are those two people?
- Thats you and Dad.

576
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,680
The show is called: "Mommy and Daddy
talk to animals."

577
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,140
Its lovely.

578
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,960
Ok.

579
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,640
- It's okay to be sad that your dad and I...
- I know. I'm not.

580
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,900
We both love you very much.

581
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:04,595
I know. It's just a drawing - not real.

582
01:00:04,596 --> 01:00:06,079
Louise?

583
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:11,997
Are you alright?

584
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:16,177
Yes I'm fine.

585
01:00:18,497 --> 01:00:20,275
I not sure if it's something...

586
01:00:20,739 --> 01:00:22,189
I can explain.

587
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,925
Would you like a checkup
with Dr. Kevin?

588
01:00:24,941 --> 01:00:26,520
I am ok.

589
01:00:27,272 --> 01:00:30,042
It's fine, I'm ok.

590
01:00:51,742 --> 01:00:54,542
<font color=#26F70F>(no dialogue)</font>

591
01:01:32,262 --> 01:01:33,754
How are you feeling?

592
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:40,164
I need some sleep, but...

593
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:42,127
I am fine.

594
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,537
Yeah?

595
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:48,980
I've been doing a bit of reading
about this idea that...

596
01:01:49,878 --> 01:01:53,452
What if you emmerse yourself into
a foreign language...

597
01:01:53,453 --> 01:01:57,484
- You can actually rewire your brain.
- It is a hypothesis.

598
01:01:58,568 --> 01:02:00,068
It is a theory that...

599
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,700
It is the theory that...

600
01:02:02,701 --> 01:02:06,235
The language you speak
determines how you think.

601
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:09,633
Yes, it affects how you see everything...

602
01:02:10,447 --> 01:02:14,368
I'm curious. Are you dreaming
in their language?

603
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:26,609
I've had some dreams.

604
01:02:28,718 --> 01:02:32,162
I don't think that makes me
unfit to do this job.

605
01:02:39,262 --> 01:02:43,262
<font color=#26F70F>(knocking on door)</font>

606
01:02:51,756 --> 01:02:54,589
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

607
01:02:55,315 --> 01:02:57,284
Know Mandarin?

608
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:03,220
People talking

609
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:13,720
The voice you're about to hear
belongs to the Chinese military chief.

610
01:03:15,228 --> 01:03:17,038
General Shang.

611
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:19,206
Put it on.

612
01:03:21,854 --> 01:03:25,140
We also have a live feed,
if you want to look.

613
01:03:26,517 --> 01:03:28,025
Rewind.

614
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,012
Stop.

615
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:36,628
He is saying each of the 12
is offering advanced technology.

616
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:41,577
Go back again... play.

617
01:03:45,012 --> 01:03:48,251
The scientific team is attempting
to decode the sense...

618
01:03:48,252 --> 01:03:51,738
"sense"?
I dont know what that means.

619
01:03:52,405 --> 01:03:54,159
Something that will manage.

620
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,253
Suits, honor and flowers. I don't...

621
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:03,248
- I don't know, that's all.
- I don't know what it means either.

622
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,196
An hour ago, China mobilized forces...

623
01:04:06,532 --> 01:04:08,865
and now Russia is following suit.

624
01:04:08,866 --> 01:04:10,882
Shang is about to start something.

625
01:04:11,441 --> 01:04:13,719
All same suits... Suits...

626
01:04:14,955 --> 01:04:18,145
suits, honor, flowers...

627
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,815
Colonel, those are all parts of Mahjong.

628
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:24,113
God... are they...?

629
01:04:24,615 --> 01:04:27,789
They are using a game to communicate
with the Heptpodes?

630
01:04:29,438 --> 01:04:32,328
Maybe... why?

631
01:04:32,981 --> 01:04:34,881
Lets say I taught them
chess instead of English.

632
01:04:35,082 --> 01:04:39,399
Every conversation would be a game,
every idea expressed through opposition.

633
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,828
Victory... defeat. You see the problem?

634
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,515
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

635
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,882
Everythings a nail.

636
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,363
We need to ask the big question.

637
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:54,358
Ready or not.

638
01:05:00,258 --> 01:05:04,258
<font color=#26F70F>(People chattering on comms
indiscernably)</font>

639
01:05:08,758 --> 01:05:09,758
<font color=#26F70F>(coversing continues... indiscernable)</font>

640
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:42,728
Heptápodes purpose.

641
01:05:52,637 --> 01:05:56,463
<font color=#26F70F>(murmering)</font>Purpose of heptápode.
Earth. What is your purpose?

642
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:05,165
Do we only have Costello?

643
01:06:10,064 --> 01:06:11,807
Ok. There you are.

644
01:06:34,315 --> 01:06:36,235
What is he saying?

645
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:45,889
Offer weapon.

646
01:06:50,635 --> 01:06:51,994
You saw what they wrote.

647
01:06:52,194 --> 01:06:54,794
Using a word that they
don't fully understand.

648
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,343
Enough!

649
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:58,045
Louise.

650
01:06:58,046 --> 01:07:00,435
We don't know if they understand

651
01:07:00,436 --> 01:07:03,103
the difference between a weapon and a tool.

652
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:07,252
Our language like a culture is messy,
and sometimes one can be both.

653
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:10,866
I think it's quite possible that they are
asking us or them for something.

654
01:07:10,867 --> 01:07:12,630
Not the other way round.

655
01:07:12,631 --> 01:07:14,267
Like the first part of trade.

656
01:07:14,268 --> 01:07:17,572
So how do we clarify their intentions
beyond these two words?

657
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:21,288
I go back in.. right
away we go back in... we clear this out..

658
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:24,371
- It's more complicated than that.
- How is it more complicated than that?

659
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:28,519
Col., the Secretary of Defense
is on the line for you.

660
01:07:35,816 --> 01:07:38,863
We need to sit on this information
till we know what it means.

661
01:07:39,303 --> 01:07:42,886
So we aren't sharing it with our enemies.
We have to consider the idea

662
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:44,662
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves,

663
01:07:44,863 --> 01:07:46,970
till only one faction prevails.

664
01:07:46,971 --> 01:07:49,518
- There is no evidence for that.
- Sure there is.

665
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:51,321
Just grab a history book.

666
01:07:51,746 --> 01:07:54,706
British in India, Germans with Rwanda.

667
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,819
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

668
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:06,989
We are a world with no single leader.

669
01:08:07,412 --> 01:08:09,875
Its impossible to deal with just one of us.

670
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:12,290
We have the word weapon now...

671
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:14,061
<font color=#26F70F>(Col Weber on phone)</font>Yes general.

672
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:18,161
<font color=#26F70F>(Alarms sounding)</font>

673
01:08:20,061 --> 01:08:25,161
<font color=#26F70F>(People conversing)</font>

674
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:40,743
What did they say?

675
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:44,380
China and Russia are off the grid.
They aren't speaking very well.

676
01:08:44,381 --> 01:08:47,430
What they learnt in the last session
has them spooked.

677
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:51,627
Yes sir.

678
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,374
We have orders to do the same.

679
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,519
- Wait these are our allies!
- Put your radio on silence!

680
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,608
- Do it.
- We received a message from the heptá...

681
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,891
Damn it!

682
01:09:02,235 --> 01:09:04,656
We need to be talking to each other!

683
01:09:04,856 --> 01:09:07,356
You want to talk to them?
Find out what this means.

684
01:09:14,701 --> 01:09:16,812
<font color=#26F70F>(Man on radio)This cam is now offline...</font>

685
01:09:21,606 --> 01:09:24,034
We've never re-entered the session before.

686
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,695
Louise, trust me ok? We got time.

687
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:28,626
Just gotta step on it, alright?

688
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,964
<b><font color=#C752ED>"USE WEAPON"</font></b>

689
01:09:30,965 --> 01:09:34,553
This is the alien message sent to provoke

690
01:09:34,554 --> 01:09:38,567
the Chinese government to withdraw their
scientists from the international mission today.

691
01:09:38,568 --> 01:09:41,053
In a statement, General Shang said:

692
01:09:41,054 --> 01:09:43,066
"China no longer trusts the aliens

693
01:09:43,067 --> 01:09:44,651
who wants to divide us.

694
01:09:44,652 --> 01:09:46,724
Humanity must be protected. "

695
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:49,781
China has asked for immediate
talks at the UN.

696
01:09:52,964 --> 01:09:55,725
<font color=#26F70F>(Man on comm)

697
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:04,104
<font color=#26F70F>Alpha 1-9, this is Condor. Come in. Over.</font>

698
01:10:09,241 --> 01:10:12,582
<font color=#26F70F>Captain Marks, Condor, not receiving a transmission.</font>

699
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,447

700

<font color=#26F70F>Capt. Marks, all escorts are

701

702
01:39:15,329 --> 01:39:17,579
No, no, no...
Dr. Banks you can't go in there.

703
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:20,290
- Just need to ask one question.
- Dr. Banks!

704
01:39:20,676 --> 01:39:23,944
The session is closed.
You can't go back in, it's dangerous...

705
01:39:23,945 --> 01:39:26,254
We just need 5 minutes. No sweat.

706
01:39:26,474 --> 01:39:27,995
Morris, Let him go.

707
01:39:30,441 --> 01:39:32,195
Hey, Abbott.

708
01:39:37,162 --> 01:39:40,432
So, what are calling our session?
Session 37?

709
01:39:40,885 --> 01:39:44,474
- No 36 Part 2
- Ok.

710
01:39:50,579 --> 01:39:52,007
Why are you alone?

711
01:39:52,008 --> 01:39:53,977
Been attempting to call Capt. Marks.

712
01:39:53,978 --> 01:39:57,570
- The escorts not responding.
- Why not?

713
01:39:58,182 --> 01:39:59,588
Send security.

714
01:40:02,687 --> 01:40:06,147
Offer a weapon... question mark.

715
01:40:10,957 --> 01:40:13,013
They are offering us something.

716
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:25,506
Technology, device, method...

717
01:40:25,507 --> 01:40:27,823
See this? This is a different word.

718
01:40:27,824 --> 01:40:30,890
This... this segment is a lot busier.

719
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:39,385
Give... technology...

720
01:40:40,718 --> 01:40:42,162
... Now.

721
01:40:50,574 --> 01:40:52,140
Whats he doing?

722
01:40:57,793 --> 01:41:00,404
Capt. ****** check.

723
01:41:08,783 --> 01:41:10,901
security team coming, sir.

724
01:41:10,902 --> 01:41:13,895
4 minutes remain.
We must see this through.

725
01:41:14,295 --> 01:41:16,144
Come on. Download weapons.

726
01:41:16,145 --> 01:41:18,957
- Fire *******.
- Understood.

727
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:20,371
We will open shooting soon.

728
01:41:20,372 --> 01:41:23,906
To be no casualties.

729
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:53,158
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

730
01:41:58,543 --> 01:42:00,643
Can you even do that?

731
01:42:01,243 --> 01:42:02,727
I don't know.

732
01:42:06,127 --> 01:42:08,127
<font color=#26F70F>(places writing the ground)</font>

733
01:42:18,830 --> 01:42:20,978
I can't do it with both hands.

734

735
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,747
Louise.

736
01:43:49,425 --> 01:43:50,852
What is that?

737
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:38,381
Hey...Hey...Hey... Take it easy.

738
01:44:38,382 --> 01:44:41,367
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

739
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:46,047
How you feeling?

740
01:44:54,517 --> 01:44:57,684
- How is Ian?
- Well, same as you. He is ok.

741
01:44:59,474 --> 01:45:02,273
- Who... who did this?
- Some soldiers.

742
01:45:04,049 --> 01:45:06,169
Been watching too much TV.

743
01:45:09,438 --> 01:45:12,869
- What is that?
- take it easy... take it easy

744
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:16,831
The place is no longer secure.
We're on standby to evacuate.

745
01:45:16,832 --> 01:45:18,493
Where is Ian?

746
01:45:19,114 --> 01:45:21,828
Weber came and got him maybe 10 minutes ago.

747
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:25,115
He wouldn't leave till
he knew you were okay.

748
01:45:28,149 --> 01:45:32,649
The whole tent is on the clock to figure
out whatever it is you were given up there.

749
01:45:38,196 --> 01:45:39,752
This is all of it?

750
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,803
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion.

751
01:45:43,448 --> 01:45:45,361
Thats right.

752
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:50,287
- You see something?
- I don't know yet.

753
01:45:50,605 --> 01:45:53,570
I need my team get together
with Louise's team.

754
01:45:53,571 --> 01:45:56,411
- I need everyone working on this.
- We can not leave.

755
01:45:56,412 --> 01:45:58,552
- Glad to see you awake.
- We need to go back in there

756
01:45:58,553 --> 01:46:00,641
and explain to them that
this wasn't our fault.

757
01:46:00,642 --> 01:46:02,602
- We can't go back inside.
- We have to!

758
01:46:02,993 --> 01:46:04,906
What happened in there was an attack.

759
01:46:04,907 --> 01:46:07,783
We can hope for the best,
but we have to prepare for retaliation.

760
01:46:07,784 --> 01:46:09,260
we may have to evacuate...

761
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:12,850
Thats a wrong move.
As long as they stay, we have to stay.

762
01:46:46,827 --> 01:46:48,922
Well, they are not leaving.

763
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:52,896
Why does it feel worse?

764
01:46:57,418 --> 01:46:59,085
China is on the offensive.

765
01:46:59,184 --> 01:47:02,994
They are positioning their military to blow
the alien vessel right out of the sky.

766
01:47:02,995 --> 01:47:06,415
If this happens, we can't sit
and wait for their retaliation.

767
01:47:06,616 --> 01:47:08,171
So get prepared.

768
01:47:08,172 --> 01:47:11,101
The Air Force and Infantry are standing by.

769
01:47:11,915 --> 01:47:13,992
<b><font color=#FF71FF>BREAKING NEWS</font></b>

770
01:47:13,993 --> 01:47:17,295
Tonight, China becomes the first world power

771
01:47:17,296 --> 01:47:20,097
To declare war against the aliens.

772
01:47:20,098 --> 01:47:23,665
Following the failure of the diplomatic
efforts of the United Nations,

773
01:47:23,666 --> 01:47:26,989
China confirmed that its language experts
tonight...

774
01:47:26,990 --> 01:47:30,389
delivered an ultimatum at the Shanghai site.

775
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:31,790
In a televised statement,

776
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:34,654
Gen. Shang, chairman of the
People's Liberation Army,

777
01:47:34,655 --> 01:47:38,555
Said the aliens have 24 hours to
leave Chinese territory,

778
01:47:38,556 --> 01:47:40,330
or face destruction.

779
01:47:40,331 --> 01:47:42,127
And he urged all other world leaders

780
01:47:42,128 --> 01:47:45,432
to unite with China and
take a similar stance.

781
01:47:46,129 --> 01:47:49,550
With a huge build up of forces
at their landing sites,

782
01:47:49,551 --> 01:47:51,830
Pakistan, Russia and Sudan

783
01:47:51,831 --> 01:47:54,266
Are thought to be following China's lead.

784
01:48:09,962 --> 01:48:11,922
It can't be random.

785
01:48:27,577 --> 01:48:29,475
Its going to take us years.

786
01:48:34,734 --> 01:48:36,488
Whats this term here?

787
01:48:40,209 --> 01:48:41,820
Mum.

788
01:48:44,267 --> 01:48:46,588
- Mother?
- Hm?

789
01:48:46,589 --> 01:48:49,975
- sweetie?
- Whats this term for that thing...

790
01:48:49,976 --> 01:48:51,983
Like a technical term...

791
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:55,526
When we make a deal and we
both get something out of it?

792
01:48:55,527 --> 01:48:58,773
- A compromise?
- No...

793
01:48:59,093 --> 01:49:01,493
Like it's competition,

794
01:49:01,494 --> 01:49:04,089
But both sides end up happy.

795
01:49:05,378 --> 01:49:07,530
And win-win?

796
01:49:07,531 --> 01:49:09,603
more sciency than that.

797
01:49:09,604 --> 01:49:11,961
If you want science, call your father.

798
01:49:26,613 --> 01:49:28,034
Thank you.

799
01:49:38,536 --> 01:49:39,993
Sorry.

800
01:49:40,337 --> 01:49:43,028
Its okay.

801
01:49:47,748 --> 01:49:49,232
What time is it?

802
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:53,458
Its time to open the bottle
you've been hiding.

803
01:49:57,273 --> 01:49:59,439
You cracked something, didn't you?

804
01:49:59,793 --> 01:50:01,975
Yeah. Come here.

805
01:50:02,708 --> 01:50:07,053
Take a look at this section.
It seems to be talking about time.

806
01:50:07,054 --> 01:50:10,585
You see the symbol of "time" - everywhere.

807
01:50:10,586 --> 01:50:12,519
So what is this?

808
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:15,880
A formula for faster than light travel?

809
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:18,026
Who can tell?

810
01:50:18,782 --> 01:50:21,807
It has too many gaps.
Its not complete.

811
01:50:21,808 --> 01:50:23,220
Then it dawned on me.

812
01:50:26,307 --> 01:50:27,743
Right here.

813
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,553
Stop focussing on the "1"s.
Look at the "0"s.

814
01:50:31,722 --> 01:50:35,327
How much of it is data and
how much of it is negative space?

815
01:50:36,498 --> 01:50:38,093
So I measured it.

816
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:42,964
0.0833 recurring.

817
01:50:48,139 --> 01:50:50,353
Perhaps you'd like to add
that as a fraction.

818
01:50:53,623 --> 01:50:55,274
1/12.

819
01:50:58,173 --> 01:51:02,005
What is saying right here, is that,
this is one of twelfth.

820
01:51:02,106 --> 01:51:05,855
- We are part of a larger hole.
- Or 1 of 12 contestants for the prize.

821
01:51:05,856 --> 01:51:08,603
- Why do we have to talk to him?
- We all working together here.

822
01:51:08,604 --> 01:51:13,122
We need to talk to the other sites,
We need to help them with what they got from the other Heptápodes.

823
01:51:13,123 --> 01:51:15,372
In case you don't remember,
we're blacked out.

824
01:51:15,373 --> 01:51:18,107
China just threatened to destroy
their Shell. We are on our own.

825
01:51:18,108 --> 01:51:19,972
But it says that all the pieces fit in.

826
01:51:19,973 --> 01:51:22,162
And I'm telling you that no one else cares.

827
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:26,136
Two hours ago we pulled this audio off
a secured channel in Russia.

828
01:51:26,137 --> 01:51:28,892
Someone from their science team
was broadcasting live.

829
01:51:31,054 --> 01:51:33,955
<font color=#20DE1B>(voice on recorder)In their final session,
the alien said:</font>

830
01:51:33,956 --> 01:51:37,225
<font color=#20DE1B>"There's no time. Many become one..."</font>

831
01:51:37,873 --> 01:51:40,223
<font color=#20DE1B>I feel we have all the given weapons.</font>

832
01:51:40,224 --> 01:51:42,351
<font color=#20DE1B>If anyone is receiving this...</font>

833
01:51:42,884 --> 01:51:44,543
<font color=#20DE1B>Please...</font>

834
01:51:44,743 --> 01:51:45,743
<font color=#20DE1B>(sound of gunshot)</font>

835
01:51:49,662 --> 01:51:51,456
Well, I mean...

836
01:51:52,334 --> 01:51:54,858
There are a lot of ways you can
interpret what he said.

837
01:51:54,859 --> 01:51:57,256
I don't need an interpreter to
know what this means.

838
01:51:57,257 --> 01:52:00,770
Russia just executed one of their own
experts to keep their secret.

839
01:52:00,771 --> 01:52:02,989
"Many become one"
can be their way of saying

840
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:05,022
Some only required.

841
01:52:05,023 --> 01:52:08,478
Why hand it out to us in pieces?
Why not give it all?

842
01:52:08,479 --> 01:52:11,212
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

843
01:52:11,842 --> 01:52:13,288
Even if I did believe you,

844
01:52:13,289 --> 01:52:17,185
How in the world are you going to get anyone
else to play along, and give out their data?

845
01:52:18,012 --> 01:52:20,028
- We offer ours in return.
- yeah?

846
01:52:22,184 --> 01:52:25,224
- What, trade?
- Its a non zero sum game.

847
01:52:27,965 --> 01:52:29,780
Non zero sum game.

848
01:52:31,145 --> 01:52:34,393
Thats it. Thanks.

849
01:52:41,618 --> 01:52:44,782
9 local completely isolated.

850
01:52:45,358 --> 01:52:49,089
Only way to reach them is to physically drive and
yell at the border guards which we are doing.

851
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,517
But it won't be fast enough.

852
01:52:50,518 --> 01:52:52,948
There must be a way to get the message.

853
01:52:52,949 --> 01:52:55,789
To our allies, maybe. But at this stage,
it's little too late.

854
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:59,181
What we need is to get all the
other nations online...

855
01:52:59,182 --> 01:53:03,010
before we start a war and theres
no way for us to reach them

856
01:53:03,011 --> 01:53:05,607
Wait. Hold on a second.
Louise.

857
01:53:06,585 --> 01:53:08,331
Its right above us.

858
01:53:09,047 --> 01:53:11,152
Thats problematic for us right now.

859
01:53:11,153 --> 01:53:13,978
The Pentagon is convinced
that our Shell will retaliate.

860
01:53:13,979 --> 01:53:16,728
I'd guess its orders say that we leave
within the hour.

861
01:53:17,834 --> 01:53:21,244
Look they are not our enemy.
They meant no act of aggression towards us.

862
01:53:21,245 --> 01:53:23,325
Maybe thats their way of being aggressive.

863
01:53:23,326 --> 01:53:26,439
- Its not the question.
- Then what is the question?

864
01:53:27,055 --> 01:53:30,600
How do we get you back in that room
thats half a mile straight up?

865
01:53:30,942 --> 01:53:32,569
I think our work here is done.

866
01:53:33,454 --> 01:53:36,137
Its in the hands of our superiors now.

867
01:53:56,271 --> 01:53:58,271
What the hell is she doing?

868

01:57:14,696 --> 01:57:16,419
Costello?

872
01:57:18,763 --> 01:57:20,493
Where is Abbott?

873
01:57:30,483 --> 01:57:33,618
<font color=#EF65FE>"ABBOTT IS DEATH PROCESS"</font>

874
01:57:50,094 --> 01:57:51,530
I'm sorry.

875
01:57:53,758 --> 01:57:55,400
We're sorry.

876
01:57:59,735 --> 01:58:01,728
I need you to...

877
01:58:02,802 --> 01:58:06,487
I need you to... to send a message...
to the other sites.

880
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:29,201
I don't... I don't understand.

881
01:58:29,605 --> 01:58:33,058

01:58:59,705 --> 01:59:02,062
How can you know the future?

886
01:59:18,706 --> 01:59:20,699
I don't...

887
01:59:21,784 --> 01:59:25,887
I don't understand. Who is this child?

888
01:59:31,124 --> 01:59:34,394
The program is called
"Mommy and Daddy talk to animals."

891
02:00:09,083 --> 02:00:12,057
Wait... No! Wait!

892
02:01:01,182 --> 02:01:02,582
- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

893
02:01:02,583 --> 02:01:04,193
Are you alright?

894
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:09,418
- You alright?
- Yeah.

895
02:01:09,419 --> 02:01:11,141
Come here.

896
02:01:11,142 --> 02:01:12,946
I tried to understand. But they...

897
02:01:12,947 --> 02:01:15,512
It doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

898
02:01:15,681 --> 02:01:17,398
- Why?
- Russia and Sudan

899
02:01:17,399 --> 02:01:18,852
will follow suit.

900
02:01:21,585 --> 02:01:23,837
Ian... I do not understand why...?

901
02:01:23,838 --> 02:01:25,834
Help me, Mama.

902
02:01:25,835 --> 02:01:27,492
Louise...

903
02:01:28,323 --> 02:01:29,783
Mom!

904
02:01:31,933 --> 02:01:33,497
Momma!

905
02:01:35,927 --> 02:01:37,879
Sorry, honey.

906
02:01:41,028 --> 02:01:43,322
What day is it, do you know baby?

907
02:01:43,323 --> 02:01:44,871
Sunday.

908
02:01:50,369 --> 02:01:52,917
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

909
02:01:53,328 --> 02:01:56,566
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

910
02:01:57,402 --> 02:01:59,751
You're gonna see him... this weekend.

911
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:03,532
He never look me anymore.

912
02:02:11,797 --> 02:02:13,654
Its my fault.

913
02:02:15,706 --> 02:02:18,952
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

914
02:02:20,789 --> 02:02:22,463
What?

915
02:02:24,122 --> 02:02:25,566
Well...

916
02:02:26,203 --> 02:02:28,124
Believe it or not...

917
02:02:28,571 --> 02:02:31,198
I know something thats going to happen.

918
02:02:33,433 --> 02:02:36,322
I can not explain how I know it,
I just do.

919
02:02:37,606 --> 02:02:40,852
And when I told your daddy, he
got really mad.

920
02:02:42,692 --> 02:02:45,057
He said I made the wrong choice.

921
02:02:47,631 --> 02:02:50,655
What? Whats going to happen?

922
02:02:53,481 --> 02:02:55,586
It has to do with a...

923
02:02:55,587 --> 02:02:57,333
A very rare disease.

924
02:03:00,342 --> 02:03:02,477
And its unstoppable.

925
02:03:04,308 --> 02:03:06,340
Kind of like you are.

926
02:03:06,908 --> 02:03:08,432
You're so amazing

927
02:03:09,306 --> 02:03:13,369
And your poetry and all the other amazing
things that you share with the world.

928
02:03:13,921 --> 02:03:18,166
- I'm unstoppable?
- Yeah.

929
02:03:35,064 --> 02:03:36,588
I got you...

930
02:03:38,082 --> 02:03:39,582
I got you.

931
02:03:40,187 --> 02:03:41,687
Louise.

932
02:03:43,219 --> 02:03:45,767
I just realized why my husband left me.

933
02:03:45,768 --> 02:03:47,516
My husband left me.

934
02:03:47,617 --> 02:03:49,070
You have been married?

935
02:03:50,303 --> 02:03:51,827
Let's get out of here.

936
02:04:25,027 --> 02:04:26,027
<font color=#00FF40>(chopper flying by)</font>

937
02:04:26,306 --> 02:04:28,191
- Mamma.
- Yeah?

938
02:04:28,937 --> 02:04:30,961
Why my name is Hannah?

939
02:04:36,406 --> 02:04:39,264
Your name is very special.

940
02:04:39,265 --> 02:04:41,457
Because it is a palindrome.

941
02:04:41,458 --> 02:04:45,048
It reads the same word from backwards.

942
02:04:45,689 --> 02:04:47,289
<font color=#00FF40>(conversation in the background)</font>

943
02:04:47,489 --> 02:04:50,677
- Turn it off.
- That goes back.

944
02:05:10,013 --> 02:05:12,100
<font color=#FF6CFF>"UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE"</font>

945
02:05:20,811 --> 02:05:21,811
<font color=#FF6CFF>"TO HANNAH"</font>

946
02:05:22,012 --> 02:05:23,255
Hey!

947
02:05:23,256 --> 02:05:25,169
We're done here.

948
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:27,363
Let's take this with us.

949
02:05:32,110 --> 02:05:34,085
<font color=#FF6CFF>"UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE BY LOUISE BANKS"</font>

<font color=#00FF40>(Inaudible)</font>

952
02:05:51,803 --> 02:05:53,446
I can read it.

953
02:05:57,461 --> 02:05:59,116
- I know what it is.
- What?

954
02:05:59,117 --> 02:06:01,747
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.

955
02:06:02,226 --> 02:06:04,163
The weapon is their language.

956
02:06:04,164 --> 02:06:06,517
They gave it all to us.

957
02:06:06,518 --> 02:06:08,951
So we can learn Heptápode?

958
02:06:08,952 --> 02:06:11,888
If you learn it... really learn it,

959
02:06:12,035 --> 02:06:14,735
you get to perceive time the way they do.

960
02:06:14,736 --> 02:06:17,352
So you get to see whats to happen.

961
02:06:17,353 --> 02:06:20,185
But time, it isn't the same for them.

962
02:06:20,186 --> 02:06:22,439
- It is not linear.
- Look...

963
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,874
We did our best but it wasn't enough.

964
02:06:25,791 --> 02:06:29,437
The captain will lift off in 5 minutes.

965
02:06:29,618 --> 02:06:33,408
Ian, Louise... It was an honor
to work with you.

966
02:06:34,115 --> 02:06:35,723
Good luck.

967
02:06:38,896 --> 02:06:40,574
Colonel...

968
02:06:47,259 --> 02:06:49,040
I'll find out where we are going.

969
02:06:57,398 --> 02:06:59,509
Wake up, Mummy.

970
02:07:34,928 --> 02:07:36,674
Dr. Banks...

971
02:07:37,656 --> 02:07:39,116
Its a pleasure.

972
02:07:39,446 --> 02:07:42,835
General Shang, the pleasure is mine.

973
02:07:43,345 --> 02:07:45,051
Your president said...

974
02:07:45,488 --> 02:07:48,767
It was an honor to host me in celebration.

975
02:07:48,768 --> 02:07:51,086
- Of course.
- I confess...

976
02:07:51,545 --> 02:07:54,878
The only reason why I am here is...

977
02:07:55,739 --> 02:07:57,564
To meet you in person.

978
02:07:58,591 --> 02:08:01,620
Well, Im flattered. Thank you.

979
02:08:02,118 --> 02:08:06,520
18 months ago, you did something remarkable.

980
02:08:07,273 --> 02:08:11,146
Something not even my superior has done.

981
02:08:12,614 --> 02:08:16,114
- What's that?
- You changed my mind.

982
02:08:18,113 --> 02:08:22,232
You are the reason for this unification.

983
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:26,499
All because you reached out to
me on my private number.

984
02:08:28,952 --> 02:08:32,428
Your private number?
General I do not know your private number...

985
02:08:39,705 --> 02:08:41,329
Now you know.

986
02:08:43,569 --> 02:08:47,061
I claimed to know how your mind works,
but...

987
02:08:47,714 --> 02:08:51,277
I believe it was important
for you to see that.

988
02:08:52,783 --> 02:08:55,069
I called you tonight?

989
02:08:55,582 --> 02:08:57,162
Yes, you did.

990
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:10,866
Louise...

991
02:09:26,653 --> 02:09:29,027
Alright, let's shut down the system.

992
02:09:29,028 --> 02:09:33,020
Sir... there's a satelite
here dialling China.

993
02:09:35,368 --> 02:09:36,951
Here? What do you mean here?

994
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:41,048
Come on, answer.

995
02:09:42,052 --> 02:09:43,672
Whose phone is it?

996
02:09:47,823 --> 02:09:49,458
It's your phone, sir.

997
02:09:56,361 --> 02:09:58,331
Search base camp now.

998
02:09:58,332 --> 02:10:00,427
Find out who is using that phone.

999
02:10:00,428 --> 02:10:03,080
- Hold on to those co-ordinates.
- Yes sir.

1000
02:10:03,081 --> 02:10:05,962
C'mon... What am I saying?

1001
02:10:06,446 --> 02:10:08,262
What am I saying?

1002
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:10,454
okay.

1003
02:10:18,732 --> 02:10:20,201
okay.

1004
02:10:21,292 --> 02:10:24,193
I never forget what you said.

1005
02:10:34,739 --> 02:10:38,168
You told me my wife's dying words.

1006
02:10:55,607 --> 02:10:57,141
We found the source of the phone call.

1007
02:10:57,142 --> 02:10:59,402
It is in decontamination.
Waiting for instructions.

1008
02:11:00,948 --> 02:11:02,960
Louise... What are you doing?

1009
02:11:04,048 --> 02:11:06,309
- What are you doing?
- Changing his opinion.

1010
02:11:06,310 --> 02:11:07,710
Buy us 20 seconds.

1011
02:11:07,711 --> 02:11:09,411
- We do not have time.
- Trust me.

1012
02:11:09,412 --> 02:11:12,352
- 20 seconds. Do you trust me?
- Now? It's all right.

1013
02:11:15,264 --> 02:11:17,059
Dr. Banks...

1014
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:19,036
Drop the phone, or we shoot.

1015
02:11:21,977 --> 02:11:24,561
- Drop it!
- Im sorry!

1016
02:11:27,071 --> 02:11:29,142
This is an act of treason!

1017
02:11:35,254 --> 02:11:37,024
- Drop it!
- Its done.

1018
02:11:37,025 --> 02:11:38,515
I got it.

1019
02:11:52,844 --> 02:11:56,044
The communications blackout
from all 12 landing sites...

1020
02:11:56,045 --> 02:11:58,378
continues this evening...

1021
02:11:58,379 --> 02:12:01,791
<font color=#00FF40>(news)Hold on... We are just hearing.</font>

1022
02:12:01,792 --> 02:12:04,355
- We are going to cut this report to tell you.
- Latest news.

1023
02:12:04,356 --> 02:12:06,649
China has called an emergency
press conference...

1024
02:12:06,650 --> 02:12:09,956
General Shang, chief of the
People's Liberation Army...

1025
02:12:09,957 --> 02:12:14,158
Has announced in an emergency press
conference that China is standing down.

1026
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:17,079
China is stating that all the intelligence
they have received...

1027
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:19,774
Will be shared immediately...

1028
02:12:20,052 --> 02:12:22,551
The world is entering a new era...

1029
02:12:22,552 --> 02:12:25,347
The Russian army are now revealing

1030
02:12:25,348 --> 02:12:29,470
information they acquired
from both their landing sites...

1031
02:12:29,471 --> 02:12:33,222
The 12 pieces of the puzzle is
slowly being put together.

1032
02:14:22,109 --> 02:14:25,409
So, Hannah...

1033
02:14:26,195 --> 02:14:28,685
This is where your story begins.

1034
02:14:30,794 --> 02:14:32,865
The day they departed.

1035
02:14:36,855 --> 02:14:38,530
Are you alright?

1036
02:14:41,628 --> 02:14:44,120
Despite knowing the journey...

1037
02:14:44,432 --> 02:14:46,337
and where it leads...

1038
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:50,866
I embrace it.

1039
02:14:53,261 --> 02:14:56,531
And I welcome every moment of it.

1040
02:15:11,287 --> 02:15:15,977
H-A-N-N-A-H.

1041
02:15:29,686 --> 02:15:31,543
Now backwards.

1042
02:15:31,544 --> 02:15:35,062
H-A-N-N-A-H.

1043
02:15:35,063 --> 02:15:36,574
Hannah.

1044
02:15:36,575 --> 02:15:37,996
You ready, baby?

1045
02:15:41,155 --> 02:15:43,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

1046
02:15:43,674 --> 02:15:46,198
- It's okay?
- Yes you can go.

1047
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:50,485
Daddy!

1048
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:02,711
Are you ok?
I'll just roll over you.

1049
02:16:05,264 --> 02:16:07,256
Are you ready?

1050
02:16:11,214 --> 02:16:13,103
Guess what... All star stuff.

1051
02:16:15,237 --> 02:16:17,523
- Ian.
- Yeah.

1052
02:16:18,255 --> 02:16:21,517
If you see your whole life,
from start to finish...

1053
02:16:23,625 --> 02:16:25,760
Would you change things?

1054
02:16:31,741 --> 02:16:33,439
Maybe I...

1055
02:16:33,982 --> 02:16:37,089
I say what I feel more often. I don't know.

1056
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:55,308
I've had my head tilted up to the stars

1057
02:16:55,309 --> 02:16:57,478
for as long as I can remember.

1058
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:02,052
But you know what surprised me?

1059
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,957
It was not meeting them.

1060
02:17:10,936 --> 02:17:12,627
It was meeting you.

1061
02:17:53,189 --> 02:17:56,277
I'd forgotten how good it felt
