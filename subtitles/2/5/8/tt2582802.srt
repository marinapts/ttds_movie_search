1
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,184
No. Stay.

3
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,071
What's your name?

4
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,741
Andrew Neiman, sir.

5
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,506
What year are you?

6
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,631
I'm first year.

7
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,990
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, sir.

8
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,941
So you know I'm looking for players.

9
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,230
Yes, sir.

10
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,389
Then why did you stop playing?

11
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,663
Did I ask you to start playing?

12
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,540
- Sorry, I...
- I asked why you stopped playing...

13
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,744
and your answer was to turn
into a wind-up monkey.

14
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,741
- Sorry, I thought...
- Show me your rudiments.

15
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,505
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,062
Double-time swing.

17
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,184
No, double-time. Double it.

18
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,431
Faster. Faster.

19
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,380
Oopsy-daisy.

20
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,423
Forgot my jacket.

21
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,063
- No Swedish Fish?
- No, not today.

22
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,670
Thanks.

23
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,744
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,871
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
He saw me play today.

25
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,830
And?

26
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,229
Well, you got plenty of options still.

27
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,460
- What does that mean?
- Just...

28
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,469
- Other options?
- Just, you know...

29
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,906
It's just life.

30
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,380
Listen, when you get to be my age,
you get perspective.

31
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,180
I don't want perspective.

32
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,666
Sorry.

33
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,825
All right.

34
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,542
I don't want the Raisinets.

35
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,350
Why didn't you say that?

36
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,708
I just eat around them.

37
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,385
I don't understand you.

38
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,223
Bye. I'll see you later. Bye.

39
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,420
My man, Ry. Oh, shit.

40
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,140
How you feeling, man?

41
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,140
It's been too long. Been too long.

42
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,620
Things were hurting
with Neiman on the kits.

43
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,867
Come on, man.

44
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,023
- What?
- He's fine.

45
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,702
- If you say so. Good seeing you.
- Yeah.

46
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,066
Yo, looking good.

47
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,900
- Hey.
- What's up?

48
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,780
- Good weekend?
- Yeah, real good.

49
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,340
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Lot of fun.

50
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,666
Nice.

51
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,184
Hey, don't worry about Greg.
Kid's a dick.

52
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,901
- No big deal.
- Good morning, everybody.

53
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,060
Good morning, everybody.

54
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,780
- Good morning.
- All right.

55
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,429
Let's do "Billy Zane"
from the top, yes? Yes?

56
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,780
- How's that? Good?
- Little right.

57
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,903
- One, two, three...
- Okay.

58
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,147
Wait.

59
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,581
All right, let's do reeds, yeah?

60
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,390
- Three.
- Yo, Ryan.

61
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,944
Watch it.

62
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,070
Yeah.

63
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,229
Accent, yeah...

64
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,945
- Not today.
- Big on the bottom. Put some sugar on it.

65
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,820
You embarrass yourself
like what's-his-face.

66
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,227
That was truly pathetic.

67
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,790
Short.

68
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,621
All right. All right.

69
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,823
That's enough of that.
Just back to the core drums, please.

70
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,867
Core players, let's go.

71
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,541
Dude, what have you been practicing?

72
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,305
May I?

73
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,751
Cute.

74
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,701
Down the line.
Trumpets, bars seven and eight.

75
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,624
Three, four.

76
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,431
Three, four.

77
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,300
Okay. All right.

78
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,140
Trombone, bar 24. The and of two.

79
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,387
Maybe not.

80
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,020
Tenor, let's start the pickup to 11.

81
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,984
Three, four.

82
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,110
Same spot. Three, four.

83
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,946
Okay. All right.

84
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,580
You're in the first chair.
Let's see if it's because you're cute.

85
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,620
Three, four.

86
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,580
Yep. That's why.

87
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,025
Drums.
Let's hear a little double-time swing.

88
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,310
Behind.

89
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,190
Same thing.

90
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,550
Bass, five bars of "Donna Lee."

91
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,705
All right.

92
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,541
Drums, with me.

93
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,950
Thank you, Joe.

94
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,147
No, no, no. Other drums.

95
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,068
Room B-16 tomorrow morning,
6:00 a.m. Don't be late.

96
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,026
All right, everybody, from the top.

97
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,587
A-one, two, three...

98
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,940
- Hey.
- How are you?

99
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,980
- Good. How are you?
- Good, thanks.

100
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,466
Good.

101
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,704
- The usual? You want, like...?
- No.

102
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,382
Look, I don't really know how...

103
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,385
I see you in here a lot, and I think
that you're really pretty and...

104
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,069
Would you wanna go out with me ever?

105
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,549
Please go away.

106
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,620
- Oh, God.
- Get out.

107
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,300
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- I'm just messing with you.

108
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,028
- I'm messing with you.
- What? Oh, my God.

109
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,580
I'm sorry.

110
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,784
- That's actually pretty mean.
- That should've... I'm sorry.

111
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,060
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

112
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,540
- What's your name?
- It's okay. No big deal.

113
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,820
Oh, I'm Andrew.

114
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,380
- Andrew.
- Yeah.

115
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,780
- I'm Nicole.
- Nice to meet you, Nicole.

116
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,820
Nice to meet you too.

117
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,260
- So you wanna take me out.
- I would love to take you out.

118
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,383
- Where do you wanna go?
- Pizza.

119
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,860
- Pizza.
- Yeah.

120
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,900
- I like pizza.
- Yeah, I know this great pizza place.

121
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,024
Cool. Okay, well...

122
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,780
I get off at 7 on Monday.

123
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,260
- Okay.
- You wanna meet here?

124
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,861
- Okay. Yeah. I will.
- Yeah.

125
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,625
Great.

126
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,823
Okay. Seven o'clock?

127
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,380
- Here.
- At 7 p.m.

128
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,580
- Monday. Andrew.
- All right.

129
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,384
- Bye.
- Bye.

130
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,900
It's not that bad. She's a go-go dancer.
Could've did porn, she chose not to.

131
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,500
- That make it better?
- Yeah, little bit.

132
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,862
- That's classier.
- I can deal with that.

133
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,391
Bitch had a foot fetish or something.

134
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,189
- This is good.
- You get on that?

135
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,071
That's it.

136
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,183
You are fucking kidding me.

137
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,180
- You the new alternate?
- Yeah. I'm Andrew Neiman.

138
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,740
Tune the set to B-flat,
then turn my pages.

139
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,430
Sure.

140
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,063
Excuse me. Could I get a B-flat?

141
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,349
Thank you.

142
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,026
Sorry. Can you...? Just one more time?

143
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,820
That's a great kit.

144
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,660
I play the new cymbals now.

145
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,066
Milk the cunt!

146
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,740
We got a squeaker today, people. Neiman.

147
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,183
Nineteen years old. Isn't he cute?

148
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,430
All right, gang, "Whiplash."

149
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,746
Page. Page!

150
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,223
Barker, that is not your boyfriend's dick.
Do not come early.

151
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,742
Bar 93.

152
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,504
Five, six, and...

153
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,630
Stop.

154
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,469
Now, this one really upsets me.
We have an out-of-tune player here.

155
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,425
Before I continue, would that player
care to identify himself?

156
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,865
No?

157
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,791
Okay, maybe a bug flew in my ear.

158
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,628
One-fifteen.

159
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,268
Five, six, and...

160
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,900
No. My ears are fine.

161
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,582
We definitely have
an out-of-tune player.

162
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,949
Whoever it is, this is your last chance.

163
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,500
And there it went.

164
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,820
Now, either you are deliberately
playing out of tune...

165
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,660
and sabotaging my band...

166
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,431
or you don't know you're out of tune...

167
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,903
which I'm afraid is even worse.

168
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,180
Reeds.

169
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,984
Five, six, and...

170
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,270
Bones.

171
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,782
Five, six, and...

172
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,829
He's here.

173
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,308
Tell me it's not you, Elmer Fudd.

174
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,704
It's okay. Play.

175
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,630
Do you think you're out of tune?

176
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,180
There's no fucking Mars bar down there.
What are you looking at?

177
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,031
Look up here. Look at me.

178
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,147
Do you think you're out of tune?

179
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,230
Yes.

180
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,424
Then why the fuck didn't you say so?

181
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,580
I've carried your fat ass for too long.

182
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,540
I won't have you
cost us a competition...

183
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,471
because your mind's on a Happy Meal
instead of on pitch.

184
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,780
Jackson, congratulations,
you're fourth chair.

185
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,427
Metz, why are you still sitting there?
Get the fuck out!

186
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,622
For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune.
You were, Erickson.

187
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,745
But he didn't know...

188
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,142
and that's bad enough.

189
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,469
All right, take 10.
When we get back, the squeaker's on.

190
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,827
Two, two, three. Two, two, three.

191
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,830
If he put half the effort
into playing the trombone...

192
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,104
Andrew.

193
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,300
- Parents musicians?
- No.

194
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,107
- What do they do?
- My dad's a writer.

195
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,421
What's he written?

196
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,304
I guess he's more of a teacher, really.

197
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,100
- College?
- Pennington High School.

198
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,950
- Your mother, what does she do?
- I don't know. She left when I was a baby.

199
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,945
No musicians in the family?

200
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,827
You just gotta listen
to the greats, then.

201
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,905
Buddy Rich, Jo Jones...

202
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,220
You know, Charlie Parker became Bird...

203
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,583
because Jones threw
a cymbal at his head.

204
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,984
See what I'm saying?

205
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,387
Listen, the key is to just relax.

206
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,940
Don't worry about the numbers.

207
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,711
Don't worry about what
other guys are thinking.

208
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,302
You're here for a reason.

209
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,868
You believe that, right?

210
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,865
Yeah.

211
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,230
Say it.

212
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,302
I'm here for a reason.

213
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,191
Cool.

214
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,670
All right, man. Have fun.

215
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,225
All right, gang, "Whiplash."

216
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,507
A little under tempo, okay?
Neiman, just do your best.

217
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,630
Here we go.

218
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,228
Five, six, and...

219
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,942
Let's hear some fills.

220
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,740
We got Buddy Rich here.

221
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,620
A little trouble there.
Just pick it up at 17.

222
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,511
Ready?

223
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,302
Five, six, and...

224
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,430
Not quite my tempo.

225
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,191
Here we go.

226
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,626
Five, six, and...

227
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,265
Downbeat on 18. Okay? Here we go.

228
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,386
Five, six, and...

229
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,260
Bar 17, the and of four.

230
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,950
Got it?

231
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,348
Five, six, seven...

232
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,820
Not quite my tempo.
It's all good. No worries. Here we go.

233
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,068
Five, six, seven...

234
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,065
You're rushing. Here we go.

235
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,548
Five... Ready? Okay.

236
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,108
Five, six, and...

237
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,420
Dragging just a hair.

238
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,990
Wait for my cue.

239
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,348
Five, six, seven...

240
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,949
Rushing. Five, six, and...

241
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,549
Dragging. Five, six, and...

242
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,302
Why do you suppose I just hurled
a chair at your head, Neiman?

243
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,062
- I don't know.
- Sure you do.

244
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,265
- The tempo?
- Were you rushing or dragging?

245
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,661
I don't know.

246
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,620
- Start.
- Five, six, seven...

247
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,345
In four, damn it. Look at me.

248
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,380
One, two, three, four.

249
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,020
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three...

250
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,348
Now, was I rushing or was I dragging?

251
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,902
- I don't know.
- Count again.

252
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,580
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

253
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,180
- One, two, three, four.
- Rushing or dragging?

254
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,620
- Rushing.
- So you do know the difference.

255
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,266
If you deliberately sabotage my band...

256
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,309
I will fuck you like a pig.

257
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,380
Now, are you a rusher...

258
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,105
or are you a dragger...

259
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,946
or are you gonna be on my fucking time?

260
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,228
I'm gonna be on your time.

261
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,260
- What does that say?
- "Quarter note equals 215."

262
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,540
- Count me a 215.
- One, two, three, four.

263
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,788
- One, two, three, four.
- Jesus Christ.

264
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,780
I didn't know they allowed retards.

265
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,300
Am I to understand
that you cannot read tempo?

266
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,300
- Can you even read music? What's that?
- Eighth note.

267
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,741
- Yes. What is that?
- Dotted 16th note.

268
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,306
Sight-read measure 101.

269
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,140
What, are you in a fucking a
cappella group? Play the goddamn kit.

270
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,540
Stop. Now answer my question.

271
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,187
Were you rushing or were you dragging?

272
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,104
- Answer!
- Rushing.

273
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,023
Oh, my dear God.

274
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,500
Are you one of those single-tear people?

275
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,580
Do I look like a double fucking rainbow
to you? You must be upset.

276
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,500
- Are you upset?
- No.

277
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,580
No? So you just don't give a shit?

278
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,989
- I do give a shit.
- So are you upset? Yes or fucking no?

279
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,180
Yes, you are upset.

280
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,420
Yeah.

281
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,820
- Say it.
- I'm upset.

282
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,830
Say it so the whole band can hear you.

283
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,509
- I'm upset.
- Louder.

284
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,860
- I'm upset.
- Louder!

285
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,420
I'm upset.

286
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,980
You are a worthless, friendless,
faggot-lipped piece of shit...

287
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,660
whose Mommy left Daddy when she
figured out he wasn't Eugene O'Neill.

288
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,540
Who's now weeping and slobbering
all over my drum set...

289
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,660
like a fucking 9-year-old girl.

290
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,780
So for the final father-fucking time...

291
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,426
- ...say it louder!
- I'm upset!

292
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,470
Carl.

293
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,585
Start practicing harder, Neiman.

294
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,467
"Whiplash," bar 125.

295
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,820
Big-boy tempo.

296
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,068
Five, six, and...

297
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,381
This place is nice.

298
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,904
Yeah. I really like the music
that they play.

299
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,906
- I mean, the food's good too, but...
- No, the pizza's really good.

300
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,145
"When I Wake."

301
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,748
- What?
- That's the name of the song.

302
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,231
Jackie Hill, July 17th, 1938.

303
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,224
Bob Ellis on the drums.

304
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,941
Every time I saw you at the theater,
your eyes were glued to the floor.

305
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,830
Really?

306
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,341
My dad says that I have...
I have trouble making eye contact.

307
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,500
My parents like to criticize me too.

308
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,540
Growing up, my mom said
I had a really big chin...

309
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,420
that's why guys wouldn't like me.

310
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,180
- Really? You don't.
- Yeah.

311
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,508
Well, she said my dad cursed me
with one.

312
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,060
It's like Jay Leno. Look.

313
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,422
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

314
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,940
- I don't... I don't think so at all.
- Well, that's nice.

315
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,701
Your chin's very nice. Very nice.

316
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,900
Your mom sounds insane.

317
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,706
She did wanna be an actress
when she was my age.

318
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,584
- What about you?
- What about me?

319
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,226
What do you do?

320
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,469
I go to Fordham.

321
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,507
What do you study?

322
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,988
I don't have a major yet.

323
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,103
- But, like, what do you want to study?
- I don't really know.

324
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,144
I don't know yet.

325
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,340
So Fordham
was just like a random school?

326
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,430
No, I applied to a bunch of schools,
Fordham let me in.

327
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,780
Why'd you pick Shaffer?

328
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,347
It's the best music school
in the country.

329
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,864
Well, Fordham was Fordham.

330
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,386
I don't love it there, to be honest.

331
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,862
- No?
- No.

332
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,704
I...

333
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,309
I don't know. I guess it's just the people.
I don't know if they like me very much.

334
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,621
I'm from Arizona,
and I think they can see it.

335
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,860
- I feel the same about people at Shaffer.
- Yeah?

336
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,380
Yeah. I don't think they like me
too much.

337
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,100
But I don't... I don't...

338
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,429
I don't care too much.
I think it just... It changes.

339
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,620
You know, people change
and things work out.

340
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,310
No, no, I know, I know.

341
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,664
I just...

342
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,509
I feel really homesick sometimes.

343
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,905
I don't know.

344
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,220
It kind of pisses me off
when people pretend like they're not.

345
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,548
In college, you know?

346
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,588
Maybe I'm literally the only one,
I don't know.

347
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,587
I still go to the movies with my dad.

348
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,940
- Hey. How are you, man?
- Good to see you.

349
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,304
And please, is this really Eva?

350
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,024
Last time I saw you, you were very tiny.

351
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,300
Are you playing an instrument yet?

352
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,860
She started piano last week.

353
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,180
When you're a big college kid,
will you come play in my band?

354
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,348
- Would you like that?
- Be my piano player?

355
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,060
Excellent. Give me five, baby.

356
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,183
- All right. Great to see you.
- Great seeing you.

357
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,340
- See you after the show.
- Absolutely.

358
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,985
Cheers.

359
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,190
Listen up, Cocksuckers.

360
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,702
Hurry the fuck up. Get your music.

361
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,020
"Irene" only. Set one.
Rhythm section out first.

362
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,827
The kit is a fucking tonal catastrophe.
Get it in tune, all right?

363
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,140
Rhythm and soloists, bar 45.

364
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,900
We're gonna pick up the tempo.

365
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,185
Bar 106, brass, do not forget
we sharp that ninth.

366
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,780
Everybody remember,
Lincoln Center use these competitions...

367
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,426
to decide who they're interested in
and who they're not.

368
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,980
I'm not gonna have my reputation
in that department tarnished...

369
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,308
by a bunch of limp-dick, sour-note...

370
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,700
flatter-than-their-girlfriends,
flexible-tempo dipshits.

371
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,700
One more thing. Give me that.

372
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,500
If I ever find one of these
lying around again...

373
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,380
I swear to fucking God,
I will stop being so polite.

374
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,948
Get the fuck out of my sight
before I demolish you.

375
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,024
Stage right, in order, now.

376
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,102
I can still fucking see you, Mini-Me!

377
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,227
Let's go. Hurry the fuck up. Let's go.

378
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,780
The Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band.

379
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,026
Hold on to this for the second set.

380
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,140
He's dumb but he's not stupid.

381
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,060
At the end of the day, he wants
a career, as dumb as he is.

382
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,151
Fudd has a chance of getting put back in,
so why would he jeopardize that?

383
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,860
- I need to look at the music.
- It's right here.

384
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,461
- Why isn't it on you?
- Where's the folder?

385
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,220
- You're joking. You're fucking around?
- No.

386
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,822
I swear I had it here two seconds ago.
It's gotta be around here.

387
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,180
- Did you see...?
- How could you be so stupid?

388
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,747
- I know. Maybe a janitor came by.
- A janitor?

389
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,506
Find the fucking folder!
A fucking janitor?

390
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,220
You're a dumb fuck! A dumb fuck!

391
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,340
- Find the folder!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

392
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,349
Tanned

393
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,180
Jesus fucking Christ,
where have you been?

394
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,111
- We have an issue.
- Okay, now is not the time.

395
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,740
I gave Neiman the folder
and Neiman lost it.

396
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,181
- Neiman lost it.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,340
The folder was your responsibility.

398
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,740
Why would you give it to Neiman? Right?

399
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,260
Give a calculator to a retard,
he's gonna turn on a TV with it.

400
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,828
- Get your sticks, get your ass on-stage.
- I... I can't.

401
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,980
You can't?

402
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,504
I... I can't go on-stage.
I don't know the charts by heart.

403
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,469
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I... You know this.

404
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,300
I need the music.
It's my memory, I need visual cues.

405
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,420
- Visual cues.
- Yes. It's a medical...

406
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,740
A medical condition?
What, are you Sanjay Gupta?

407
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,226
Play the goddamn music.

408
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,745
- I can't.
- I can.

409
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,545
- You know "Whiplash" by heart?
- Yes. Every measure.

410
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,220
All right. Well, you better fucking hope
your memory doesn't fail you.

411
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,540
I hope you play it a lot better
than you did last month.

412
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,580
I do not intend to start losing.

413
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,624
Get your sticks and get your ass
on-stage. On-stage!

414
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,020
And in first place...

415
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,109
Shaffer Conservatory.

416
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,465
Hey. Don't fucking touch my folder, man.

417
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,507
Do not touch this kit.

418
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,860
All right, let's get to work, ladies.

419
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,191
Tanner, what you doing? It's core only.
I don't have time for alternates.

420
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,143
"Cherokee." From the top.

421
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,905
Tanner, are you a fucking statue?
Let's go. Get off the stool.

422
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,387
Don't forget to turn Neiman's pages.
Here we go.

423
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,227
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

424
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,150
What did you do to your hand?

425
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,900
- Is that from drumming?
- Yeah. It's nothing.

426
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,182
So how's it going with the Studio Band?

427
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,460
Good.

428
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,628
Yeah, I think he likes me more now.

429
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,190
And his opinion means
a lot to you, doesn't it?

430
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,581
Yeah.

431
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,631
Wanna grab the shakers?

432
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,620
Jimbo? Overcooked.

433
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,788
You can barely chew this.

434
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,865
- He just laughs.
- So how's the drumming going, Andy?

435
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,020
Yeah, it's going really well.
I'm the new core drummer, so...

436
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,700
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

437
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,390
Tom Brady.

438
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,309
- Did you hear, Jim?
- No, what?

439
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,820
- Trav got named this year's MVP.
- That's fantastic, Travis.

440
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,500
Yeah, and Dustin is heading up
Model UN...

441
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,510
soon to be Rhodes Scholar
and who knows what else.

442
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,780
And Jim, teacher of the year.

443
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,780
- Well, hey, listen...
- I mean, come on.

444
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,347
The talent at this table,
that is stunning.

445
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,783
- And Andy, with your drumming.
- It's going okay, Andy?

446
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,420
Yeah, it's going really,
really well, actually.

447
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,987
I'm part of Shaffer's
top jazz orchestra...

448
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,707
which means
it's the best in the country.

449
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,100
And I'm a core member...

450
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,900
so I'll start playing in competitions.
I just...

451
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,620
I found out I'm the youngest person
in the band.

452
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,666
How do you know who wins in
a music competition? Isn't it subjective?

453
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,748
- No.
- Does the studio get you a job?

454
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,580
It's not an actual studio.

455
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,660
It's the name of the ensemble,
but it's a big step forward in my career.

456
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,069
I'm so glad you figured it out.
It's a nasty business, I am sure.

457
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,380
Hey, are you gonna tell them
about your game this week?

458
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,902
- Living up to your title.
- I scored a 93-yard touchdown.

459
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,824
School record, school record.

460
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,030
- Is that true? That's fantastic.
- It's Division Three.

461
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,426
It's Carlton football. It's not even
Division Two, it's Division Three.

462
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,423
- You got any friends, Andy?
- No.

463
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,550
- Oh, why is that?
- I don't know. I never saw the use.

464
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,740
Who are you gonna play with otherwise?
Lennon and McCartney were buddies.

465
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,342
Charlie Parker didn't know anybody
till Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

466
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,900
That's your idea of success?

467
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,700
Being the greatest musician of the 20th
century is anybody's idea of success.

468
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,340
Dying broke and drunk
and full of heroin...

469
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,980
at the age of 34
is not my idea of success.

470
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,300
I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34
and have people talk about me...

471
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,580
than live to be rich and sober at 90
and nobody remember who I was.

472
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,060
But your friends will remember you,
that's the point.

473
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,661
None of us were friends
with Charlie Parker. That's the point.

474
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,621
Travis and Dustin, they have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose.

475
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,900
They'll make great
school board presidents.

476
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,860
You think you're better than us?

477
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,900
- Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?
- I got a reply for you.

478
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,020
You think Carlton football is a joke?
Come play with us.

479
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,620
Four words you will never hear
from the NFL.

480
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,664
- Who wants dessert?
- Heard from Lincoln Center?

481
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,140
Okay, get out of here. Pick up the new
chart by the door on your way out.

482
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,506
Rehearsal 9 p.m. sharp tonight.
That's how long you have to learn it.

483
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,110
Neiman. Stick around a minute.

484
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,948
See the tempo marking on there?

485
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,340
"Quarter note equals 330."

486
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,186
That is a double-time swing.

487
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,863
- That's what got you in here, right?
- Oh, yeah.

488
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,507
As fate would have it,
I recently stumbled across another kid...

489
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,182
in the practice room
working on his double-time swing.

490
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,349
So I'm gonna give him a shot.

491
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,860
- Am I late?
- Perfect timing.

492
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,903
Come on in, Connolly.

493
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,380
- You two know each other, right?
- Yeah, Nassau band.

494
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,627
What's up, Andrew?

495
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,820
I've made Neiman a temporary core,
but with this competition coming up...

496
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,460
I just wanna make very sure
this chart is in the best shape it can be.

497
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,583
Yeah, this one right here, right?

498
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,340
I gave Connolly the chart this morning.

499
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,540
All I wanna do is give you both
a crack at it, all right?

500
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,900
So, Neiman, go ahead,
jump on the kit, take it from the top.

501
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,545
Okay.

502
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,388
I don't want you to worry
about hits now. Just tempo, okay?

503
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,110
All set?

504
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,262
One, two...

505
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,380
Not quite my tempo. Connolly.

506
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,300
- I can take it from the top.
- Connolly, go ahead.

507
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,583
- I can do...
- No. We'll go with Connolly now.

508
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,191
Hey, do you mind?

509
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,749
Okay, man, ready?

510
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,791
One and two and...

511
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,140
- Perfect, Connolly.
- Oh, my God.

512
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,380
See, this to me
is the beauty of Studio Band.

513
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,260
You walk in here an alternate,
you could be the new core.

514
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,500
- Oh, my God, are you serious?
- Thanks.

515
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,748
That shit?

516
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,264
Fletcher.

517
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,866
Thanks, man. Here you go.

518
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,505
Don't worry about Fletcher.
He's more bark than bite.

519
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,382
Hey, look, you...
I can play these charts.

520
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,780
- Now is not the time, I swear to God.
- I can play it, okay?

521
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,427
I said not now!
If you want the fucking part, earn it.

522
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,900
I'm just gonna lay it out there.

523
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,751
This is why I don't think
we should be together.

524
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,100
And I've thought about it a lot,
and this is what's gonna happen.

525
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,587
I'm gonna keep pursuing
what I'm pursuing.

526
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,620
Because I'm doing that,
it's gonna take up my time.

527
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,140
I'm not gonna be able
to spend time with you.

528
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,820
Even when I do,
I'm gonna be thinking about drumming.

529
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,945
About jazz, my charts. Because of that,
you're gonna start to resent me.

530
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,460
You're gonna tell me to ease up on
the drumming, spend more time with you.

531
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,220
I'm not gonna be able to do that. I'll start
to resent you for even asking me to stop.

532
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,740
We're just gonna start to hate
each other. It's gonna be ugly.

533
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,820
And so for those reasons...

534
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,069
I'd rather just, you know,
break it off clean.

535
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,902
Because I wanna be great.

536
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,222
And you're not?

537
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,583
I wanna be one of the greats.

538
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,950
And I would stop you from doing that?

539
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,904
Yeah.

540
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,300
You know I would stop you
from doing that?

541
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,780
You know that for a fact?

542
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,505
Yes.

543
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,665
And I'd barely see you anyway?

544
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,100
- Yeah.
- I see you, you'd treat me like shit...

545
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,860
because I'm some girl
who doesn't know what she wants.

546
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,667
You have a path, you're going
to be great, I'm gonna be forgotten...

547
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,380
and you won't be able
to give me the time of day...

548
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,504
because you have bigger things
to pursue.

549
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,300
That's exactly my point.

550
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,781
What the fuck is wrong with you?

551
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,268
You're right. We should not be dating.

552
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,182
I'm okay. Thanks.

553
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,508
Fuck! Fuck!

554
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,990
Fucking piece of shit!

555
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,780
Fuck you!

556
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,470
Fuck!

557
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,341
Fucking piece of shit! Come on!

558
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,028
Sorry, we have a new player.
Ryan Connolly.

559
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,389
I'm sorry.

560
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,351
Guys, just put your instruments
down for a minute.

561
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,542
Just listen for a minute.

562
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,502
Six years ago...

563
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,105
I came across a kid in a practice room
working on his scales.

564
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,468
He was early second year and he'd
started at Shaffer with a lot of hope.

565
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,183
Like all you guys.

566
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,427
But the truth was that he barely
squeaked in to begin with...

567
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,228
and he was really struggling.

568
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,023
The faculty were all telling him,
"Maybe this isn't for you."

569
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,140
But they didn't see what I saw.

570
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,260
This scared, skinny kid...

571
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,060
cursing himself because he
couldn't get his scales right.

572
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,581
I saw a drive in him.

573
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,471
And I put him in Studio Band.

574
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,429
And when he graduated...

575
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,900
Marsalis made him third trumpet
at Lincoln Center.

576
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,660
A year later, he was first.

577
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,942
That's who you're listening to now.

578
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,186
His name was Sean Casey.

579
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,621
I found out this morning...

580
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,549
that Sean...

581
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,707
died yesterday...

582
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,662
in a car accident.

583
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,382
And I just...

584
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,502
I wanted you guys to know
he was a beautiful player.

585
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,422
I just thought you should know.

586
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,784
I'm sorry.

587
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,510
Okay.

588
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:15,310
Let's get to work, huh?
How about "Caravan," bar 105?

589
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,942
Two bars for free.

590
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,149
One and two and...

591
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,224
It's not quite right, Connolly.

592
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,544
I'd like to try Neiman on this.

593
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,311
Maybe now's the time
for Neiman to earn the part.

594
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,751
One and two and...

595
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,865
Nope, I guess not. Tanner?

596
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,349
One and two and...

597
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,949
Motherfucker!

598
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,911
Connolly, get your ass back on the kit.

599
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,751
We will stay here for as long as it takes
until one of you fagots can play in time.

600
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,423
One and two and...

601
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,464
Looks like that might be all night.
Neiman.

602
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,220
One and two and...

603
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,990
Not my fucking tempo!

604
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,871
Sorry, guys.
Hate to put you through this.

605
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,460
If you need to fucking take a dump
or get a coffee...

606
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,340
whatever, now might be a good time.

607
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,340
We're gonna stay until I find a drummer
who can fucking play in time.

608
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,111
I apologise to the musicians.

609
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,420
Seriously, take 10, 20, a fucking hour.

610
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,940
You hear me, cocksuckers?
Better start shitting me perfect 400s.

611
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,302
Connolly, get your fucking ass
back on the kit.

612
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,905
Is that really the fastest you can play,
you worthless Hymie fuck?

613
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,227
No wonder Mommy ran out on you.
Get off the fucking kit.

614
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:39,183
And here comes Mr. Gay Pride
of the Upper West Side himself.

615
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,620
This is not a Bette Midler concert.
We will not be serving baked Alaska...

616
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,824
so just play faster
than you give hand jobs, will you?

617
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,028
One, two, one, two.

618
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,140
Not even fucking close.

619
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,786
Let's go with the Irish Mick
Paddy cracker now.

620
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,060
You know, you actually do look
quite a bit like a leprechaun.

621
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,024
I'm gonna start calling you Flannery.

622
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,024
Get off!

623
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,100
What are you looking for?
There's no gold down there.

624
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,745
Adjusting the seat? Really?

625
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,460
That's been your problem
the whole time? The seat height?

626
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,230
So now you have it, right?

627
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,144
Go.

628
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,950
Bullshit! Fuck you!

629
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,150
Neiman.

630
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,226
Maybe it's time...

631
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,748
to finally bring this home.
What do you say?

632
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,625
Show me.

633
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,467
Don't slow down.

634
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,704
Pick it up.

635
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,023
Faster!

636
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,824
Faster!

637
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,910
Faster!

638
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,746
Faster!

639
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,944
Faster!

640
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,789
Keep playing!

641
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,630
Keep playing! Keep playing!
Keep playing!

642
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,303
Don't stop.

643
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,583
Neiman...

644
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,380
you earned the part.

645
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,982
Alternates, you wanna clean
the blood off my drum set?

646
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,347
Okay, we can start now.

647
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,948
5 p.m. call tomorrow in Dunellen.

648
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,260
Give yourselves at least two hours
to get there this time, all right?

649
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,144
Save your travel receipts.

650
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,271
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

651
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,660
- Do you know where the cabs are?
- You gotta call the cabs.

652
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,740
- The cab was supposed to be here.
- You gotta call. They take forever.

653
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,271
How do I get to Hargrove?

654
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,500
Hey. Come on.
Please, come on. You're still open.

655
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,431
You're still open.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

656
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,340
Yeah, hello?

657
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,900
Neiman, where are you, man?
Call time was 5.

658
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,940
I know, I know.
I'm almost there. I'm right there.

659
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,980
- We're on-stage in 20.
- I know.

660
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,820
- Fletcher's got Connolly warming up.
- God fucking da... Okay.

661
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,786
You just tell that little fucking redhead
I'll... I'm gonna be there, okay? Fuck.

662
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,783
Hey. Hey. Sorry I'm late.

663
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,260
Well, glad you could fit us
into your busy schedule, darling.

664
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,420
I'm sorry I'm late. I'm ready to go.

665
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,180
- Connolly's playing the part.
- Like fucking hell.

666
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,825
What the fuck did you say to me?

667
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,107
It's my part.

668
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,980
It's my part and I decide
who to lend it to.

669
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,063
Usually it's somebody
that has fucking sticks.

670
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,100
I left them in the car.
I'll be right back. Five minutes.

671
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,665
I'm warming up the band now.

672
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,263
- I can use Ryan's sticks.
- Neiman, you lost the fucking part.

673
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,343
No, I didn't. You can't do this.

674
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,620
- Can't?
- Yeah.

675
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,221
When did you become a fucking expert
on what I can do...

676
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,300
- ...you fucking weepy-willow shit sack?
- I earned that part.

677
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,231
You never earned anything.
You are a self-righteous prick.

678
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,060
The only reason you're a fucking core
is because you misplaced a folder.

679
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,580
Only reason you're in Studio Band
to begin with is because I told you...

680
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,828
what I'd be asking for in Nassau.

681
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,260
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah.

682
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,900
- I'm in Studio Band because I'm the...
- Back off.

683
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,751
Hey, fuck off, Johnny Utah.
Turn my pages, bitch.

684
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,780
Hey. I can cut you
any fucking time I want.

685
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,950
- You would've cut me by now.
- Try me, you fucking weasel.

686
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,620
At 5:30, that's in exactly 11 minutes,
my band is on-stage.

687
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,060
If your ass is not on that stool
with your own sticks in hand...

688
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,308
or if you make one fucking mistake...

689
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,460
one, I will drum your ass
back to Nassau...

690
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,980
where you can turn pages
until you graduate or fucking drop out.

691
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:40,100
By the time you're done at Shaffer,
you'll make Daddy look like a success story.

692
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,509
Got it? Or we can let Johnny Utah
play the part.

693
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,540
- You choose.
- That's my part. I'll be on your stage.

694
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,220
- Fuck you.
- You got 10 minutes...

695
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,264
you fucking pathetic,
pansy-ass fruit fuck.

696
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,820
- Tell Fletcher I'm coming.
- What's taking you so long?

697
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,263
- We're moving on-stage.
- I got locked in my car. I'm coming.

698
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,100
Left turn, 200 feet.

699
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,189
- Are you driving, man?
- No.

700
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,940
What the hell was that noise?

701
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,702
Okay, why don't you just tell Fletcher
that I'm coming, you motherfucker?

702
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,106
Hey. Hey, hey.

703
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,260
Are you okay? Are you okay?

704
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,340
- I gotta get my sticks.
- No, stay away from the car.

705
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,500
- I've called 911.
- Look, I gotta go.

706
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,702
- No, no, sir.
- A couple more blocks.

707
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,181
- Sir, no, you don't have to...
- Please get off me.

708
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,665
- Hey, guy.
- What the fuck happened to you?

709
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,181
The Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band.

710
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,701
Neiman, what the fuck?

711
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,264
Fuck.

712
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,909
Neiman...

713
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,511
you're done.

714
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,744
Gentlemen, ladies, I apologise...

715
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,824
on behalf of Shaffer Conservatory.

716
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,384
Piece of shit. I'll fucking kill you.

717
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,590
- Fuck you.
- Get the...

718
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,141
- Get the fuck off me.
- Get off me. Fuck off.

719
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,151
Fuck you.

720
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,020
Fuck you!

721
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,222
Fuck you, Fletcher! Fuck you!

722
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,225
Get off. Fuck. Piece of shit!

723
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,144
Fuck you!

724
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:46,664
- When did you start talking to her?
- Your father got in contact this week.

725
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,620
Does the name Sean Casey
mean anything to you?

726
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,422
You know of his death?

727
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,150
Last month, he hanged himself
in his apartment.

728
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,780
- What does that have to do with me?
- He suffered from anxiety, depression.

729
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,382
His mother claims this started
during his time as Fletcher's student.

730
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:13,351
Now, the Caseys aren't wealthy,
they don't wanna file suit.

731
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,349
So, what do they want?

732
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,427
To make sure Terence Fletcher is never
allowed to do this to another student.

733
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,823
Hey, Dad, look at my paradiddle.

734
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,580
Yeah, that's my boy.

735
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,660
- He didn't do anything.
- What is wrong with you? It's over, okay?

736
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,460
He's out of your life.
Why would you let him get away?

737
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,028
Would you characterize his
conduct as extreme, Andrew?

738
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,702
Did he ever intentionally inflict
emotional distress?

739
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,391
This would not be a public hearing,
you know.

740
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,942
Fletcher would never know
it was you who spoke up.

741
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,584
Why would you do this to me?

742
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,943
Do you think that I would let him
put my son through hell...

743
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,581
and then just walk away scot-free?

744
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,540
Don't you know
I would never let that happen?

745
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,540
That there is nothing in the world
more important to me than you?

746
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,663
Don't you know that?

747
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,064
Andrew?

748
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,789
Andrew?

749
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,542
Just tell me what to say.

750
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,711
Hey.

751
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,580
I'd give anything to be there again
this fall.

752
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,980
I like weddings,
provided they're not mine.

753
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,620
Marriages are very healthy.

754
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,107
Married men live much longer
than bachelors.

755
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,580
They're trying to outlive their wives
so they can be bachelors again.

756
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,580
- Haven't you thought of getting married?
- I did.

757
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,180
The young lady changed her mind
at the last moment.

758
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,100
I've been deeply indebted
to her ever since.

759
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,620
And I loaded the pantry up with Gushers.

760
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,187
- Saw that.
- Okay.

761
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,985
All right.

762
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,670
Thanks.

763
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,225
Right on, man.

764
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,144
Andrew.

765
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,625
Hey.

766
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,223
I don't know if you heard.

767
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,502
I'm not at Shaffer anymore.

768
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,911
Yeah, I did hear that.

769
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,900
Did you quit?

770
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,989
Not exactly.

771
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,380
Some parents got a kid from
Sean Casey's year, I think...

772
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,460
to say some things about me.

773
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,980
Although why anybody
would have anything...

774
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,150
other than peaches and cream
to say about me is a mystery.

775
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,750
Yeah.

776
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,220
- That's a good laugh, right?
- I'm sorry.

777
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,180
- No, listen... I get it.
- I'm sorry.

778
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,348
I know I made enemies.

779
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,141
I'm conducting a little, though.

780
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,500
They brought back
the JVC Fest this year.

781
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,749
They got me opening in a
couple of weeks with a pro band.

782
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,509
That's great.

783
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,500
Yeah. It's all right.

784
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,941
Truth is, I don't think
people understood...

785
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,831
what it was I was doing at Shaffer.

786
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,664
I wasn't there to conduct.

787
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,420
Any fucking moron can wave
his arms and keep people in tempo.

788
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,182
I was there to push people
beyond what's expected of them.

789
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,029
I believe that is...

790
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,946
an absolute necessity.

791
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,980
Otherwise, we're depriving the world
of the next Louis Armstrong.

792
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,625
The next Charlie Parker.

793
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,460
I told you about how Charlie Parker
became Charlie Parker, right?

794
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,460
- Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
- Exactly.

795
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,780
Parker's a young kid,
pretty good on the sax.

796
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:42,622
Gets up to play at a cutting session,
and he fucks it up.

797
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,630
And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

798
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,466
And he's laughed off-stage.

799
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,420
Cries himself to sleep that night,
but the next morning, what does he do?

800
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,588
He practices.

801
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,740
And he practices and he practices
with one goal in mind...

802
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,546
never to be laughed at again.

803
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,700
And a year later, he goes back to
the Reno and he steps up on that stage...

804
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,427
and plays the best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard.

805
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,580
So imagine if Jones had just said:

806
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,866
"Well, that's okay, Charlie.
That was all right. Good job."

807
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,109
And then Charlie thinks to himself,
"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job."

808
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,140
End of story.

809
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,024
No Bird.

810
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,507
That, to me, is an absolute tragedy.

811
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,865
But that's just
what the world wants now.

812
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,229
People wonder why jazz is dying.

813
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,620
I tell you, man,
and every Starbucks "jazz" album...

814
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,266
just proves my point, really.

815
01:20:55,880 --> 01:21:00,780
There are no two words in the
English language more harmful...

816
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,823
than "good job."

817
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,302
But is there a line?

818
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,020
You know, maybe you go too far and
you discourage the next Charlie Parker...

819
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,260
- ...from ever becoming Charlie Parker.
- No, man, no.

820
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,862
Because the next Charlie Parker
would never be discouraged.

821
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,670
Yeah.

822
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,740
The truth is, Andrew...

823
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,111
I never really had a Charlie Parker.

824
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,829
But I tried.

825
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,380
I actually fucking tried.

826
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,500
And that's more than most people
ever do.

827
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:51,945
And I will never apologise
for how I tried.

828
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,540
I'll see you later.

829
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,901
Yeah.

830
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,500
Hey, Andrew. Listen, I have no idea
how you're gonna take this...

831
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:19,867
but the band I'm leading for JVC,
my drummer is not cutting it.

832
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,468
You understand what I'm saying?

833
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,540
No.

834
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,020
I'm using the Studio Band playlist.

835
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,588
You know, "Caravan," "Whiplash."

836
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,502
I need somebody
who really knows those charts.

837
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,064
What about Ryan Connolly?

838
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,780
All Connolly ever was to me
was incentive for you.

839
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,867
- Tanner?
- Tanner switched to premed.

840
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,430
I guess he got discouraged.

841
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,351
Hey.

842
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,307
Take the weekend. Think about it.

843
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,065
- Hello?
- Hey, Nicole, it's Andrew.

844
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,545
- Hi.
- Hey.

845
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:35,620
It's been a while since I talked to you.

846
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,700
Look, I...

847
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:41,220
I'm really sorry about everything.

848
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:46,950
I know that's not, you know, enough,
but I'm just really sorry.

849
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:56,500
But anyway, I got...
I actually have this show this weekend.

850
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,380
It's a...

851
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,900
Like, a JVC thing. And I didn't know
if maybe you'd wanna go...

852
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,740
and we, you know, maybe
get some, like, pizza afterwards...

853
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,700
and, like, complain
about our schools again.

854
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,980
What is...? You said Jayvees?

855
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,184
No, it's JVC.

856
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,550
It's like a... It's a jazz thing.

857
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,500
Yeah.

858
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,384
Oh, okay.

859
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:33,461
Well, I don't know if I can come. I...
I'll have to check with my boyfriend.

860
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,745
Okay.

861
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,505
Yeah.

862
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,340
Yeah, I'll check, but I don't know.

863
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,820
I don't really think
he likes jazz music.

864
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,785
Yeah, I mean, it's not for everybody.

865
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:57,584
Okay. Well, I guess
maybe I'll see you guys there.

866
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

867
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,665
Bye.

868
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,180
All right, gang, listen up. Now,
for those of you who are new at this...

869
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:34,783
which looks like everybody except Cal,
tonight could change your life.

870
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:40,420
The folks out there make a phone call,
you could be a Blue Note signee...

871
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,181
an EMC client, a Lincoln Center core.

872
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,180
On the other hand...

873
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,860
if you drop the ball, you might be
looking for a new line of work...

874
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:54,861
because the other thing
about these cats is they never forget.

875
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,900
We all set?

876
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,944
All right. Let's have fun.

877
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,901
You think I'm fucking stupid?

878
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,510
- What?
- I know it was you.

879
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,140
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

880
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:30,020
We're very excited to be here kicking
off the JVC Festival this year.

881
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,340
I'm Terence Fletcher, these are some
of the best musicians in New York...

882
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,300
which means they're some of the best
musicians in the world.

883
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,540
We're gonna do some old standards,
but we're gonna start with a new tune...

884
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,425
by Tim Simonec called "Upswingin'."

885
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,987
What the fuck you doing?

886
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,541
Come on, man.

887
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,140
Yeah, I guess maybe you don't have it.

888
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,949
That was a little extra avant-garde
there from the rhythm section.

889
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,511
Come on, let's go home.

890
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,264
What are you doing?

891
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,940
Now we're gonna slow it down
a little bit.

892
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,108
I'm guessing most of you folks
have heard...

893
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,700
I'll cue you in.

894
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,028
"Caravan."

895
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,909
Three, four.

896
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,182
I'm gonna gouge out
your motherfucking eyes.

897
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,990
- Andrew, what are you doing, man?
- I'll cue you.
