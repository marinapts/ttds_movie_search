1
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,661
<i>I have no idea
how to tell this story.</i>

2
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,431
<i>I don't even know
how to start it.</i>

3
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,666
<i>Like, I guess I could use
one of those classic</i>

4
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,435
<i>story beginning sentences.</i>

5
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:14,504
<i>"It was the best of times;
it was the worst of times."</i>

6
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:17,206
<i>But what would that even mean?</i>

7
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,074
<i>I mean, obviously,
somewhere in the world,</i>

8
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:21,376
<i>it's the best of times
for someone.</i>

9
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:23,277
<i>Like he's eating all this insane</i>

10
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:24,811
<i>Vietnamese food
he just got for free...</i>

11
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,813
<i>...and the woman
who delivered the food</i>

12
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:29,182
<i>looks exactly like the hot
girl from Pussy Riot</i>

13
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,350
<i>and now she's situated
in the corner</i>

14
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:33,652
<i>playing unspeakably beautiful
melodies on the harp.</i>

15
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:35,553
<i>While he's just going to town
on that food.</i>

16
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:38,355
<i>So, yeah,
that's the best of times.</i>

17
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:40,523
<i>Meanwhile, some other guy
is having</i>

18
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:42,358
<i>his will broken
by professional torturers...</i>

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,694
<i>over a crocodile-infested
pool of acid.</i>

20
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:47,362
<i>And because it's acid,</i>

21
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:49,430
<i>these crocodiles
are just pissed.</i>

22
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:51,598
<i>And they're also piping in
that gross smell you get...</i>

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,232
<i>...when they spill
a bunch of milk</i>

24
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,399
<i>in the school parking lot.</i>

25
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:56,267
<i>And this beefy torture dude</i>

26
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,202
<i>is just punching
the hell out of him.</i>

27
00:01:58,204 --> 00:02:00,303
<i>Check.</i>

28
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:11,312
<i>All right, look.
I'll just start.</i>

29
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:13,347
<i>This is the story of
my senior year of high school</i>

30
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,248
<i>and how it destroyed my life.</i>

31
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,284
<i>And how I made a film so bad,
it literally killed someone.</i>

32
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,677
<i>I used to think about it
this way:</i>

33
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:50,780
<i>Schenley High School
was a world unto itself.</i>

34
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:53,682
<i>By senior year, I had mastered
the languages and customs</i>

35
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:54,964
<i>of its various sovereign states.</i>

36
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:58,319
<i>The head nods of Jock Nation.</i>

37
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,721
<i>The fist bumps
of the Kingdom of Stoners.</i>

38
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,556
<i>The innocuous witticisms of</i>

39
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,757
<i>The People's Republic
of Theater Dorks.</i>

40
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,159
Greg, how was your summer?

41
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,227
Summer. What does that word
even mean?

42
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,195
Like, more "summ"?

43
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:11,362
<i>In a typical high school life,</i>

44
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:13,497
<i>you belong to one nation...</i>

45
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,866
<i>...which can never
guarantee you total security.</i>

46
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,181
<i>But I thought
I found a way out.</i>

47
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,771
<i>Get citizenship in every nation.</i>

48
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,173
<i>Get passports to everywhere.</i>

49
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,475
<i>Just be on low-key
good terms with everyone...</i>

50
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:30,677
<i>...casually interact with them
once in a while...</i>

51
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,845
<i>...in a way that is invisible
to everyone else.</i>

52
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,513
<i>Never commit to an interaction</i>

53
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,281
<i>that won't be casual or mellow.</i>

54
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,749
Your test was today?

55
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,851
Ugh. Tests!
I've been there.

56
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,620
<i>That's like sending troops
to Afghanistan.</i>

57
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:46,622
<i>Maintain relationships
with citizens</i>

58
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:48,223
<i>of the most
dicked-upon nations.</i>

59
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:50,692
<i>For example, Scott Mayhew,</i>

60
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,727
<i>the gothy dork
I'm sitting next to here.</i>

61
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:53,861
Scott, nice Berserker.

62
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:55,696
Thank you?

63
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,198
<i>It took years of cultivation
to win his trust.</i>

64
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,802
<i>Or the universally
ostracized Ill Phil.</i>

65
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:08,839
<i>Truly a nation of one.</i>

66
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:14,410
<i>And there were some
places I simply couldn't go.</i>

67
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:16,879
<i>Like the cafeteria.</i>

68
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,681
<i>Every last square inch of it
was disputed territory.</i>

69
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:22,450
<i>It was Crimea, Kashmir,</i>

70
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,532
<i>and the Gaza Strip
all rolled into one.</i>

71
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:28,955
<i>Also the part of
the Indian Ocean with pirates.</i>

72
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:32,858
Captain Phillips <i>pirates,</i>
<i>not</i> Pirates of the Caribbean.

73
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,493
<i>Although, actually, who knows?
Maybe both.</i>

74
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:43,632
<i>Instead, I always ate lunch
in the office</i>

75
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:44,933
<i>of my history teacher.</i>

76
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:45,967
<i>Mr. McCarthy.</i>

77
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,868
Fact:

78
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,937
I'm in 309 for
the next... 20 minutes.

79
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,840
<i>The only reasonable adult
in all of Schenley.</i>

80
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,374
Heathens.

81
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,309
Respect the research.

82
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,511
<i>With Earl,
whose role in my life</i>

83
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:03,280
<i>I'm not even gonna try to
explain to you right now.</i>

84
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:07,784
<i>The harmony of overwhelming
and collective murder.</i>

85
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:09,886
<i>Hot girls destroy your life.</i>

86
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:14,023
<i>It doesn't matter if the hot
girl is also a good person.</i>

87
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:16,892
<i>She's a moose,
you're a chipmunk.</i>

88
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:19,134
<i>She's just wandering through
the forest, oblivious.</i>

89
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:22,777
<i>And she doesn't even know that
she stomped on your head.</i>

90
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,531
Hey, Madison.

91
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,633
Hey, how was your summer?

92
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:31,268
Summer. What does that word
even mean, right?

93
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:33,903
More "summ."

94
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:36,572
Winter, same deal.
More "wint"?

95
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:39,407
McCarthy's in 309.

96
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,709
Great, thanks.

97
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,644
<i>To become humbled</i>

98
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:45,612
<i>in front of
this overwhelming misery...</i>

99
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:48,681
<i>...and overwhelming
fornication</i>

100
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,416
<i>and overwhelming lack of order.</i>

101
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,650
Titties.

102
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,953
Honey, can we come in?
Jesus, Jesus!

103
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,355
Yeah. What do you want?

104
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,956
First of all,
I was going through...

105
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,425
...your stuff
and I saw that you

106
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:04,026
have not even unwrapped
your college directory.

107
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:05,727
Mom, don't go through my stuff.

108
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:08,763
We discussed it, and she gets
to go through your stuff.

109
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,431
Just have a look.
It's fun.

110
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,732
It's like a menu
for your future.

111
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:14,568
What are you in the mood for?
Some Penn State?

112
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,337
Some Pepperdine?
Pomona? Princeton?

113
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,538
I'm not getting into Princeton.

114
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,180
He's not getting into Princeton.

115
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:21,973
Um, so, is that it?

116
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:23,941
No, honey, it's not it.

117
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:26,863
Your father and I want to talk to you
about something kind of sad.

118
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,779
What?

119
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,749
What happened?

120
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,884
Well, I just got off the phone
with Denise Kushner,

121
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:40,052
Rachel's mom. You know Denise?

122
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,887
Um, not really.

123
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,455
You're friends
with Rachel, though.

124
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:44,897
Yeah, I mean,
we're like, acquainted.

125
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,423
Come here.

126
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:48,925
Okay.

127
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,932
Rachel's been diagnosed
with leukemia.

128
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,466
They just found out.

129
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:02,501
Your test was today?

130
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:06,838
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.

131
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:10,374
Oh, God.

132
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,677
Is that serious?

133
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,911
They're doing
all kinds of tests.

134
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:17,078
They're doing
everything they can.

135
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,646
They just don't know.

136
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,547
Man, that sucks.

137
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:21,681
You're right.

138
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:23,816
It sucks.

139
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,784
It sucks really bad.

140
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:27,585
It sucks quite a bit.

141
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:28,886
Yeah.

142
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,792
Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.

143
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:38,660
Well, he's deeply distraught.

144
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:41,695
Well, you know,
I was talking to Denise...

145
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:44,097
...and Denise feels that
you might be someone...

146
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,499
...who could make
Rachel feel better.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,001
Yeah, but like I said,

148
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:50,002
we're not really friends, so...

149
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,737
Just give Rachel a call.

150
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,539
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to say?

151
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,840
"Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's

152
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,242
"never really paid
attention to you...

153
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,577
"...but now you have cancer,
so let's hang out"?

154
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,811
That's not gonna work.

155
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,978
She'll think
you're being sarcastic.

156
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,245
Are you telling me
you can't do

157
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:05,146
one nice thing
for another person?

158
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:07,181
I mean, honestly, is that
really what's happening here?

159
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:09,550
Fine. Okay.

160
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:11,818
Just, please don't
go through my stuff.

161
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,153
Or I'll start going through
your stuff.

162
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:16,822
I hope you like tampons.

163
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:19,758
<i>It's
Central Pittsburgh on 90.5...</i>

164
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:24,195
<i>This is Rachel.</i>

165
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:25,930
Hey, it's Greg Gaines.

166
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:26,932
<i>Hi.</i>

167
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,033
Yo!

168
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:33,770
So, I called a doctor...

169
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,139
...he said you needed
a prescription of Greg-acil.

170
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,381
<i>What's that?</i>

171
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:38,981
Uh...

172
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:40,709
It's me.

173
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:44,779
In convenient gel-tab form.

174
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:46,747
<i>Oh.</i>

175
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,781
Yeah.

176
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:52,217
<i>So, I guess
you heard I'm sick.</i>

177
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:53,685
Yeah.

178
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,219
<i>Did my mom tell you?</i>

179
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:57,821
Um, well, my mom told me.

180
00:08:57,823 --> 00:08:58,823
<i>Oh.</i>

181
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:00,923
So, um...

182
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,891
<i>What?</i>

183
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:03,925
What?

184
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,026
<i>What were you gonna say?</i>

185
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:07,760
Um...

186
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:10,095
<i>Greg, what?</i>

187
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:12,530
Uh, yeah,
I was just calling to see

188
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,064
if you wanted to hang out.

189
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:15,798
<i>Right now?</i>

190
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:17,899
Um, sure.

191
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:19,867
<i>No, thanks.</i>

192
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:22,102
Oh.

193
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,104
Okay, so you don't
wanna hang out?

194
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,805
<i>No. Thanks anyways.</i>

195
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,908
Okay. Um, bye.

196
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,276
<i>Bye.</i>

197
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:34,078
Mom, what are you doing?

198
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,946
Okay, Mom, listen,
she doesn't want to see me.

199
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:37,580
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you, Gregory...

200
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:38,547
...that you do not
have a choice

201
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:39,981
in this particular matter.

202
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:41,248
Mom, please, let me say
one thing for one second.

203
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,782
You have been
given an opportunity

204
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:44,884
to make a very real difference
in someone's life.

205
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:46,285
And if what you're
choosing instead

206
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,319
is to lie around the house
all day...

207
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,954
She doesn't want to see me!

208
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,655
...I will be required
to step in...

209
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,757
We're not even friends!

210
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,025
...and inform you that
that is 100% unacceptable.

211
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:58,660
Your nonstop stream of
words is making me freak out!

212
00:09:58,662 --> 00:09:59,994
And if you think that all
these excuses you're making

213
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:01,695
are in any way better...

214
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,830
...or more important,
than the happiness

215
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:05,198
of a girl with cancer...

216
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,832
Mom! I am now entering
a subhuman state.

217
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,133
...a friend with cancer,

218
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:10,001
you are sadly mistaken,
my friend.

219
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:13,804
You are going to pick up
that phone.

220
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:16,273
You're going to
call Rachel again.

221
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,195
You are going to.
You are going to.

222
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,236
Oh, Greg.

223
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:52,139
Oh, Mrs. Kushner.

224
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,073
Denise, Greg.

225
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:57,041
To you, I'm Denise, okay?

226
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,209
Oh, okay. Good.

227
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:01,878
You're a real good kid,
you know that?

228
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,013
You really are.
You just have a big heart.

229
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:06,982
You're kind, nice.

230
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,951
I really appreciate it.

231
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:13,326
Thank you.

232
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:18,042
Good, good, good, good, good...

233
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:20,924
...good boy.

234
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:22,659
Okay.

235
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,828
You really are kind,
big-hearted, delicious...

236
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,896
...yummy, yummy, young boy.

237
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,999
And you're so, so, handsome.

238
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:34,668
Oh, I'm not handsome,
but thank you.

239
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,070
And so modest.

240
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,192
I guess I'm a modest mouse.

241
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:43,108
Greg, where do you come up
with this stuff?

242
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,743
Well, that's the name
of a band, actually.

243
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,225
Oh.
Yeah.

244
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:49,278
Rachel!

245
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,080
I've got a modest little mouse
here to see you!

246
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:54,148
Rachel.

247
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,816
Greg, what are you doing here?

248
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:57,984
So, uh...

249
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,719
...the doctor
really recommends

250
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,054
a strong dosage of Gregitor.

251
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,321
You already used that joke.

252
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,323
No.

253
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:09,192
No, 'cause last time
it was about Greg-acil...

254
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:12,094
...which if you recall comes
in convenient gel-tab form.

255
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,162
Look, I don't want you
hanging out with me.

256
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:15,796
I don't need your stupid pity.

257
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:16,763
It's fine, you can just go.

258
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:18,264
No, no.

259
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,866
You got it all wrong. I'm not
here 'cause I pity you.

260
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:23,335
I'm actually here
because my mom is making me.

261
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,404
That's actually worse.

262
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,672
Yeah, I know.

263
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:32,008
Look, it's okay. Honestly,
I'm fine. Just... just go.

264
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,343
Okay, Rachel, just listen
to me for a second.

265
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:38,312
My mom is gonna turn my life
into a living hell...

266
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:40,781
...if I don't hang out
with you.

267
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:44,151
I can't overstate how annoying
she's being about this.

268
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:46,820
She's basically like
the LeBron James of nagging.

269
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:50,289
LeBron James plays basketball.

270
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,531
I know who LeBron James is.

271
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:55,993
Look, I know I'm not doing you
any favors here.

272
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:58,161
What I'm asking is for you
to do me a favor.

273
00:12:58,163 --> 00:12:58,961
You want a favor from me?

274
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,828
Yes.

275
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,330
Just let me hang out
with you for one day.

276
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,165
I could tell
my mom we hung out

277
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,467
and then we'll just be
out of each other's lives.

278
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:09,234
Deal?

279
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:12,337
Deal.

280
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,838
Word.

281
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,273
Is that a Black Power salute?

282
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,041
No, I was going in
for a fist bump.

283
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:20,175
I can't fist bump you
from up here.

284
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:22,043
Yeah, I realize that.

285
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:38,859
Books.

286
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Nice.

287
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:45,330
And, uh...

288
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:48,332
...tree wallpaper.

289
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,433
That's good.

290
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,001
Why?

291
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,002
I don't know.

292
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:23,496
There's a lot of pillows
in here.

293
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,366
Mmm-hmm.

294
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,402
Seriously, like, how many...
how many pillows is that?

295
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:32,871
I don't know.

296
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,140
I wish I had
that many pillows.

297
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,911
So, ask your parents for some.

298
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,246
No, they'd be suspicious
or something.

299
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,582
What, that you'd sleep
all the time?

300
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,584
No. Probably assume

301
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,218
I was gonna masturbate
all over them.

302
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,521
They just have
some gross ideas about me.

303
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:53,523
But that's on them.

304
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,125
They're always getting
sexy pillows.

305
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:00,427
This is a nice pillow.

306
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:01,561
This pillow is a dude,
obviously...

307
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:03,095
...but it reminds me
of this pillow

308
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:04,996
we used to have
named Francesca.

309
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:06,530
They have a similar coloring.

310
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,398
Anyway, Francesca,
we had to eventually

311
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,633
give away because in the end...

312
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:12,935
...that whole situation
was just a real problem.

313
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,536
It was a mess.

314
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,971
There was a real chemistry

315
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:19,139
between us both that
I think no one could deny.

316
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:22,208
I know the world may have
thought it was wrong...

317
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,044
...but I think, personally,
the world was wrong...

318
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:26,945
...about what
could be between...

319
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,481
...a pillow, and a boy...

320
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:33,049
...who became a man.

321
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,386
Or whatever. I'm just...

322
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,188
...trying to be funny.

323
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,589
No, that was good. Thank you.

324
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:47,659
Oh, shit.

325
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,031
I actually have to go.

326
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,966
That's okay. Who was that?

327
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,435
Sorry. Uh, that was Earl.

328
00:15:58,437 --> 00:15:59,477
Oh, who's Earl?

329
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:03,039
<i>You may remember Earl
from 15 minutes ago.</i>

330
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,540
Titties.

331
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,475
<i>So, some people think
Earl is my friend,</i>

332
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:07,676
<i>but he's really not.</i>

333
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:09,577
<i>He's more like a coworker.</i>

334
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:11,211
<i>I've known him
since kindergarten.</i>

335
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:13,580
<i>His house is
a short walk from mine,</i>

336
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:15,548
<i>but in a much
tougher neighborhood.</i>

337
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,018
<i>His dad is in Texas, his mom
is a depressed shut-in.</i>

338
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,053
<i>And his brother
Derrick's dog Doopie</i>

339
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:23,055
<i>will definitely eat me someday.</i>

340
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:26,591
Doopie, Doopie, chill!

341
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,997
<i>So over the years we've
mostly hung out at my place.</i>

342
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:38,266
<i>Usually with my dad,
a tenured sociology professor.</i>

343
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:40,501
What you got, cat?
You wanna fight?

344
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:43,103
Didn't think so, punk-ass cat.

345
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:44,971
- Boys!
<i>- His job allows him</i>

346
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:46,472
<i>to be frequently at home
doing nothing.</i>

347
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:48,507
You'll want to pay
close attention to this.

348
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,510
The insane conquistador,
Aguirre,

349
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,178
is raging through the jungle...

350
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,747
...in search of a golden city
that doesn't exist.

351
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,448
<i>The wrath of God.</i>

352
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,184
It's a classic
of foreign cinema.

353
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,685
<i>Who else is with me?</i>

354
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,687
<i>In addition to the best films...</i>

355
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,388
This is cuttlefish.

356
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,223
<i>...my house also has
the weirdest food.</i>

357
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:10,225
A sea creature
much like a squid.

358
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:12,760
It is a favorite East Asian
snack food.

359
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:15,062
<i>Obviously we come from
pretty different backgrounds.</i>

360
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:17,364
<i>But somehow, we like
most of the same things.</i>

361
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,100
Yes, its smell is
odd and repellent

362
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:21,568
to our Western noses.

363
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,070
<i>And we learned pretty early on</i>

364
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:25,538
<i>that we were the only ones
who liked...</i>

365
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,307
<i>...for example,
classics of foreign cinema.</i>

366
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:31,543
<i>Why did we like them?</i>

367
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:33,545
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

368
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:35,280
<i>Maybe it's that they were
weird and often violent,</i>

369
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:37,215
<i>like us.</i>

370
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:39,717
<i>Or confusing and possibly
meaningless, like life.</i>

371
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,352
<i>You can't escape of
this stinkin' camp</i>

372
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,553
<i>because you never know
when they call you.</i>

373
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:47,023
<i>Because you're paid for,
you're under contract.</i>

374
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,493
<i>Anyway,
we liked them so much</i>

375
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:52,695
<i>we started making our own.</i>

376
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,229
<i>Action!</i>

377
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:57,097
<i>The idea behind
each one was...</i>

378
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,198
<i>...we took a film
that we liked</i>

379
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,699
<i>and made the title stupider.</i>

380
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,267
<i>And then made a new film</i>

381
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:03,102
<i>to reflect
the new stupid title.</i>

382
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:05,104
<i>It's a formula that only
produces horrible films...</i>

383
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:07,606
<i>...but for some reason
we keep using it.</i>

384
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:53,213
<i>We've made 42 films.</i>

385
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,781
<i>You'd think we'd have stopped
making them by now.</i>

386
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,682
<i>But we haven't.</i>

387
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:58,417
<i>Honestly, it's like
you can't go anywhere.</i>

388
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,219
<i>You can't escape this
stinking place...</i>

389
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:02,820
<i>...because you don't know
when they call you...</i>

390
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:06,523
<i>and you're paid to be here,
it's bullshit.</i>

391
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,424
<i>Yeah, and it's like, you know,</i>

392
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:10,592
<i>I can't do anything.
I'm not a free person.</i>

393
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:14,395
Truly, one of my favorites
from your oeuvre.

394
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:17,231
A mature investigation
into the nature of violence.

395
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,533
Dad, for like
the billionth time,

396
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,855
you're not allowed
to watch these.

397
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,436
I'm a fan.

398
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,273
You gonna go see
that girl again?

399
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:31,176
I mean, probably, yeah.

400
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:32,610
You gonna play
with them titties?

401
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:35,346
No. It's not like that.

402
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,680
Well, that's not right.

403
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,314
I mean, this could be
her last chance on Earth

404
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:39,648
to be with a man.

405
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,116
Don't make this about you.

406
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:42,118
Earl!

407
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,353
First of all,
if it's that high-stakes,

408
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,355
probably won't even be able
to get a boner.

409
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,357
Did I even say shit
about boners?

410
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,559
No.

411
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:56,162
What kind of cancer even is
acute myelogenous leukemia?

412
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,531
You know, cancer of the, uh...

413
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,199
...the thing.

414
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,802
<i>It's bullshit!</i>

415
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,871
The Battle of Antietam was
the bloodiest day

416
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:09,605
in American history.

417
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:12,674
Class, what do you have to
say for yourselves?

418
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,676
Respect the research.

419
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,377
That is what
I'm talking about!

420
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,178
All right, run for your lives.

421
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,060
Save yourselves.
Go, go, go, go, go.

422
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,680
Good work today, everybody.

423
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,516
Way to go. Bam.
Love it. Good stuff.

424
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,451
Good job.
Excellent work today.

425
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:30,386
Excellent. Nice job.
Hey, can I talk to you?

426
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:31,387
Can I talk to you
for a second?

427
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:33,455
Sure, Greg, what's up?

428
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:36,925
Uh, do you know
any facts about leukemia?

429
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:38,626
Leukemia?

430
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:42,695
Yeah, it's a cancer of the
blood and/or bone marrow.

431
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,562
Why?

432
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:46,830
Right, so it's pretty
spread out in the body?

433
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,665
That is a fact, yes.

434
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,300
How soon do
people die from it?

435
00:20:51,302 --> 00:20:52,868
I think it's often
pretty treatable, bud.

436
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,536
Why do you ask?

437
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:57,472
Well, you know Rachel Kushner
has leukemia, right?

438
00:20:57,474 --> 00:20:58,573
Wait, Rachel has what?

439
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,508
I'm, like,
innovatively stupid.

440
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:05,945
Everyone was gonna find out
sooner or later.

441
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,280
Just hate having to share
everything about myself.

442
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:09,522
I'm the exact same way.

443
00:21:10,215 --> 00:21:12,349
You know, one thing you can do

444
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:13,616
if you don't want to
talk to anyone...

445
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:15,498
...is just enter
a subhuman state.

446
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:19,854
Here, pretend you're
someone annoying.

447
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:28,461
"Hi, Rachel.

448
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:29,903
"I'm really sorry
you have cancer."

449
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:44,741
Does that ever work?

450
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:48,745
Yeah, of course.
It works all the time.

451
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,980
It's called passive resistance.

452
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:53,449
You know, that's what Gandhi
was all about.

453
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:55,571
I'm pretty sure Gandhi
never did the subhuman thing.

454
00:21:58,554 --> 00:22:01,389
That's how India achieved
statehood. Here, try it.

455
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:06,426
Nope.

456
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:07,668
Come on, it's easy.

457
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,798
Okay. Or another thing
you can do is just

458
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,299
flat-out pretend to be dead.

459
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,435
Say something annoying to me.

460
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,437
Um...

461
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,406
"Hey, Rachel. I just want you
to remember

462
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,374
"that your cancer
is all part of God's plan."

463
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:32,748
<i>Hey, asshole.</i>

464
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,082
<i>Yeah, over here.</i>

465
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,717
<i>Just so we're straight on this,</i>

466
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,418
<i>you're advising
a girl with cancer...</i>

467
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,420
<i>...to pretend to be dead.</i>

468
00:22:41,622 --> 00:22:43,055
<i>No, seriously.</i>

469
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,990
<i>Think about what you're
doing here, dickhead.</i>

470
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,624
<i>I've been doing
my broody Wolverine face on</i>

471
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:47,925
<i>this girl's wall...</i>

472
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,760
<i>...for five
and a quarter years,</i>

473
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:51,061
<i>and at this point, I'm
probably only still here...</i>

474
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:52,695
<i>...because she'd feel
weirdly guilty</i>

475
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:54,396
<i>or disloyal taking me down.</i>

476
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:55,997
<i>But I'm goddamned
if I'm letting</i>

477
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,531
<i>a little punk like you
waltz in here...</i>

478
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:58,832
<i>...stupiding up the place!</i>

479
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,066
<i>Not on my watch, pal.</i>

480
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:01,100
Greg, what's wrong?

481
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:04,903
I'm really sorry.

482
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,406
I shouldn't have told you
to pretend to be dead.

483
00:23:08,408 --> 00:23:09,840
That was really insensitive.

484
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,876
I mean, I'm sick.
I'm not dying.

485
00:23:12,878 --> 00:23:15,111
Yeah, I know, but I just...

486
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:17,379
Now I'm being
all weird about it.

487
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,714
And I can't get un-weird,
'cause I just...

488
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:21,148
Despite what you said,

489
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,983
I'm clearly still sitting here
thinking...

490
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,345
..."death, death, death,
death, death, death."

491
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:39,630
That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

492
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:44,567
<i>So if this was
a touching romantic story...</i>

493
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:45,801
<i>...this is probably
where a new feeling</i>

494
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:47,002
<i>would wash over me...</i>

495
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:50,405
<i>and suddenly we would be
furiously making out...</i>

496
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,367
<i>...with the fire
of a thousand suns.</i>

497
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:58,778
<i>But this isn't
a touching romantic story.</i>

498
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,713
Anyway...
Yep.

499
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:02,481
<i>But we did still become friends.</i>

500
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:12,457
Daniel Craig's thing is,
he's got an accent, right?

501
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:15,193
So he's used to talking with
his mouth in a weird shape...

502
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:17,595
...which is why he has
pouty lips, like a woman.

503
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:20,464
Lickable technology, like,
I could text you a sandwich.

504
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:24,668
There's a button on the nape
of his neck, under the skin.

505
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,003
Just push it
if you want him to stop.

506
00:24:27,005 --> 00:24:29,071
Do you believe animals
just live in our house,

507
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:30,772
and everyone's cool with it?

508
00:24:30,774 --> 00:24:32,673
Like, real animals?

509
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:34,775
Anyway. You talk now.

510
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:37,610
You mean, talk about cancer?

511
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:40,045
Only if you want to.

512
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:41,713
The hardest part is
watching my mom

513
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:44,716
trying to deal with it all.

514
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:46,451
And sometimes, I mean,
I do think if it ends up

515
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:48,753
that she's alone
in that house...

516
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,488
She has no one. She and my dad
hate each other.

517
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,989
She has no siblings.

518
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,523
I don't know what she'd do.

519
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,126
Don't cry.

520
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,728
I'm not crying.

521
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,930
Right, well, you know,
you can cry if you need to.

522
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:03,652
I thought you said,
"Don't cry."

523
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:08,135
Me and my dad used to
walk around the block

524
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:10,670
and count squirrels.

525
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:12,605
Why? Did he work for, like,
the squirrel census?

526
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:14,006
No, it was just
something we did

527
00:25:14,008 --> 00:25:16,241
when it was time for us
to spend time together.

528
00:25:16,243 --> 00:25:17,675
We didn't even say anything
while we did it.

529
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:19,643
All we'd say was stuff like:

530
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:22,679
"Squirrel, seven."
"Two squirrels, nine."

531
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:26,482
Jesus. You need to apply
for a dad refund immediately.

532
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:27,516
What group am I in?

533
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:28,984
What?

534
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,685
Yesterday you were
saying you'd mapped out

535
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:31,819
the entire high school by group.

536
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,220
What's my group?

537
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:35,555
Seriously?
Yeah.

538
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:38,824
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

539
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:41,726
Please appreciate
how honest I was just now.

540
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:42,728
You're an asshole.

541
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:45,862
What group are you in?

542
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:49,031
Uh, I'm not
in a group, actually.

543
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:51,666
I just wouldn't belong to
a group that doesn't suck.

544
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,268
You know,
I'm terminally awkward

545
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,003
and I have a face
like a little groundhog.

546
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:58,270
So...

547
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,971
You can't really think that.

548
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,673
No, I don't think that.

549
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:04,808
I know that.

550
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,911
I just feel like, you know,
for a kid like me...

551
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,615
...in high school,
best case scenario,

552
00:26:12,617 --> 00:26:14,283
just... survive. You know?

553
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:17,252
Survive without creating
any mortal enemies...

554
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:19,687
...or hideously embarrassing
yourself forever.

555
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:22,122
Just survive until college?

556
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,924
College? No. God, college is
going to be even worse.

557
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:26,925
What?

558
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:29,661
I mean, at least high school,
it's over at 3:00...

559
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:32,797
...and it's kids
I mostly know by now.

560
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,665
But college is just gonna be
non-stop strangers.

561
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,166
And some of them
even live in your room.

562
00:26:36,168 --> 00:26:38,701
It's like you can
literally never relax.

563
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:40,969
I see myself dying of
a panic attack two weeks in.

564
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:43,971
I might just not apply.

565
00:26:43,973 --> 00:26:46,640
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard you say.

566
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:48,642
It's probably
not even top five.

567
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,812
And, you know,
high school, college,

568
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:54,113
we're forced to spend
these years of our lives...

569
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:56,148
...in randomly selected
groups of people

570
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,883
that we have nothing
in common with.

571
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,117
It's a nightmare.

572
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,153
Anyone who says otherwise
is lying.

573
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,055
Congratulations, Greg.

574
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,222
Tomorrow,
you're eating lunch with

575
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,757
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

576
00:27:12,627 --> 00:27:13,867
So where do you usually sit?

577
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:18,923
It's literally like we're trying
to have lunch in Kandahar.

578
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:25,903
Rachel, we just found out the
theme for this year's prom:

579
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,871
"A Knight to Remember."

580
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:29,873
Knight with a "K."
Medieval prom!

581
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,075
Isn't prom like
six months away?

582
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:33,242
Hi, guys. This is Greg,

583
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:35,244
he's gonna be
sitting with us today.

584
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:37,779
Anybody need any spoons? No?

585
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:41,114
Hello.

586
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:46,218
So, Greg, why are you
sitting with us today?

587
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,753
You know, it's lunch.

588
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:50,988
You gotta eat somewhere.
Can't stand and eat.

589
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,924
You and Rachel seem very
friendly, all of a sudden.

590
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,125
Yeah.

591
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:57,693
You're only talking to her
because she has cancer.

592
00:27:57,695 --> 00:27:59,127
What?

593
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:01,596
Greg, you hung out
with Rachel once.

594
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:02,897
You're befriending her to
feel good about yourself.

595
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:04,298
No, I'm not.

596
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
Who even does that?

597
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,169
You guys mind
if I sit with you?

598
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,171
Of course not.

599
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:15,372
Sorry, it's a...

600
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:17,040
It's a pillow.
It's meant to be a baby,

601
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:18,875
for health class.

602
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:20,042
You think it's safe here?

603
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:21,076
A pillow?

604
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,431
Greg, what do you think?

605
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:25,646
Mmm, I don't know.

606
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:27,014
Better not get it
too close to me,

607
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:29,376
otherwise I might just
masturbate onto it.

608
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,471
Ew, Greg,
that's just weird and gross.

609
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:38,689
Hey, everyone,

610
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:40,924
check out Scott Mayhew's
Tyrannosaurus walk.

611
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:43,126
It's a great way to get
from point A to point B.

612
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:44,994
That was really mean, Greg.

613
00:28:44,996 --> 00:28:46,228
I think he heard you.

614
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:53,967
<i>And just like that...</i>

615
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,703
<i>...eight years
of carefully-cultivated</i>

616
00:28:57,705 --> 00:29:00,005
<i>invisibility... gone.</i>

617
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:01,941
Fin.

618
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,342
Your mom made cookies?

619
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:09,045
Nah, I won them off
of Ill Phil in a game of tonk.

620
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,215
Got tired of whooping
your sorry ass.

621
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,750
Why do they even call it
Scholar Horizons Biology?

622
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:18,019
Maybe they should call it
Scholar Horizons Tonk.

623
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,520
Or Sometimes Paper Football.

624
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:21,188
Heathens.

625
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,710
What up?
Hi, Mr. McCarthy.

626
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:25,191
Wow.

627
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:30,195
Earl, fact,
that lunch is garbage.

628
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:33,398
You're literally poisoning
yourself right in front of us.

629
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,166
At least I ain't eating
no funky ass

630
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:37,868
seaweed-looking tentacle soup.

631
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,503
Seriously, this stuff
is the business.

632
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:42,805
It's Vietnamese.
It's called Pho.

633
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,840
It is "Pho-nomenal."

634
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:46,042
Well, let me try
some one time.

635
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,141
Mmm.

636
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:50,209
Now you want to try some?
Yeah.

637
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:51,977
Well, no.

638
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:54,245
It's strictly forbidden for me
to give you food.

639
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:55,379
However, if you go to...

640
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:59,482
...Thuyen's Super
Saigon Flavor

641
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:01,083
over in Lawrenceville...

642
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:03,051
...and ask for Thuyen.

643
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,519
Tell him to put it on my tab.
You'll be all set.

644
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,991
I ain't going to
no damn Lawrenceville.

645
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:12,258
Fair enough.

646
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:16,227
You'll have to excuse me.

647
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:21,197
Boys.

648
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,898
Respect the research.

649
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Respect!

650
00:30:30,938 --> 00:30:32,471
God! You know,
people just assume that

651
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:34,172
Rachel and I are dating.

652
00:30:34,174 --> 00:30:35,806
It's ruining my life.

653
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:38,475
Today I threatened to
sexually assault a fake baby.

654
00:30:38,477 --> 00:30:41,110
And I became mortal enemies
with Scott Mayhew.

655
00:30:41,112 --> 00:30:43,352
Both of which
are Rachel's fault.

656
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,014
Sorry, but they just are.

657
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,916
Of course I'm a dick
for complaining about it.

658
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:51,158
I mean, I am a dick
for complaining about it.

659
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:53,854
I didn't actually mean
any of that.

660
00:30:53,856 --> 00:30:55,288
Better play with them titties.

661
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:02,706
Does this taste strange to you?

662
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,047
<i>The soup had drugs.</i>

663
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:07,250
Whoa!

664
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:14,055
McCarthy must've
put weed in that soup

665
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,356
because my brain
is trying to eat itself.

666
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:16,990
Oh, my God.

667
00:32:16,992 --> 00:32:18,358
I have to go visit
Rachel right now.

668
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,093
Okay, well, you do that.

669
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:22,161
I'ma be at your house
eatin' up all your dad's food.

670
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:23,996
No! You have to
come help!

671
00:32:23,998 --> 00:32:25,163
Help with what?

672
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:26,165
Help!

673
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,067
Hey, in class,
do McCarthy act all, like,

674
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:32,334
stoned and shit?

675
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,202
Uh, I don't know.
I guess.

676
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,636
Yeah, sometimes.

677
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,537
Well, not sometimes,

678
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,038
but you know what I'm...
You know how he is.

679
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,106
Goddamn, son.

680
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:44,208
You can't even put a full damn
sentence together.

681
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,144
It's insane that Mr. McCarthy
eats soup with drugs in it.

682
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:49,379
Hey, come on, man,
keep your damn voice down.

683
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:03,592
We can't tell anyone
we're on drugs.

684
00:33:03,594 --> 00:33:04,993
Why the hell not?

685
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:09,163
Because then they'll know.

686
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:31,282
It's my humble little mouse.

687
00:33:31,284 --> 00:33:33,317
And who is
his little mouse friend?

688
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:37,954
Earl Jackson.

689
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:41,424
Earl's just my coworker,
and, uh, he's a great guy.

690
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:43,559
We were just walking around
the neighborhood, you know.

691
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:46,395
Not really doing anything,

692
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:47,996
and just wanted
to come say "What's up?"

693
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:50,231
'Cause Rachel's
about to lose her hair.

694
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:51,699
Mmm.
So, just wanted to say,

695
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:55,335
you know,
"Bye, hair. Good riddance."

696
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:58,037
She's gonna look great without
hair. That's a fact, so...

697
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:00,005
Yeah, I just wanted to say
what's up.

698
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:03,041
Rachel! We've got
two cute little mouse boys

699
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,923
on our doorstep
that wanna say hi!

700
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,315
Would you two... mice
like a little bit of cheese?

701
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:17,506
Okay.

702
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:27,327
I like your room, Rachel.

703
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:29,629
Thanks. Greg thinks
it's too girly.

704
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:32,264
No, I love girly,
I think it's fine.

705
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:33,632
Well,
it ain't too girly.

706
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:36,434
"Yo, this some
pink puffy bullshit."

707
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:38,169
I mean, Hello Kitty posters

708
00:34:38,171 --> 00:34:40,437
and chocolate and naked dudes
all over the wall.

709
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:42,572
They make me want to
throw up for real.

710
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:45,074
Hey, if you're gonna throw up,
don't do it in here, okay?

711
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:46,076
This is her room.

712
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,511
Anyways.

713
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:51,833
Rachel, we really just wanted
to see how you was doin'.

714
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:53,614
Thanks.

715
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:56,283
Yeah, chemotherapy.
That really sucks.

716
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:57,285
Greg.

717
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:01,454
What the hell, bro?
Don't say it suck, dumb-ass!

718
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:03,489
It does kinda suck.

719
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:05,390
Yeah, but I mean, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

720
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:06,524
Yeah, I guess.

721
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:09,493
Um...

722
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:13,562
Uh...

723
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:15,130
Look, you guys can go
if you want.

724
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:16,631
We're on drugs.
Oh, shit!

725
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:18,332
Why are you on drugs?

726
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,700
Well, we're accidentally
on drugs.

727
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,201
"Accidentally"?

728
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,169
McCarthy gave us some soup.

729
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:25,404
Well, McCarthy gave us
some of his,

730
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,339
you know, just regular,
normal soup...

731
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:28,406
...but then, it was
the last of the soup

732
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:29,507
so we had to
go get some more...

733
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:31,575
...from a restaurant,

734
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:33,343
on the fifth floor
of an office building.

735
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:34,777
And in the same building,

736
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:36,145
there was a Jamaican embassy...

737
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:38,680
...and we ended up
getting trapped

738
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:40,415
in an elevator
with a Rastafarian guy...

739
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:43,217
...and he just hotboxed
the whole elevator, so...

740
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,752
We were stuck in there
for, like, 25 minutes...

741
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:46,686
...and we had to breathe
the weird marijuana air.

742
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:48,587
Earl, am I right?

743
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:49,789
That's exactly what happened.

744
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:53,490
You guys had
quite an adventure.

745
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:56,125
Being on drugs
just really sucks.

746
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:58,093
Being around people
on drugs sucks.

747
00:35:58,095 --> 00:36:01,563
This whole situation, really
sorry, just sucks. I'm sorry.

748
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:04,132
Yo, yo. What the hell
is your problem, man?

749
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,600
All apologetic and shit,

750
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:07,101
making shit
'bout your sorry ass.

751
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:09,203
Look, that's not what we came
here to do. Okay?

752
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:10,404
You wanna help,
you gonna take this girl out

753
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:11,772
to get some ice cream.

754
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:14,775
And me, too,
'cause I love that shit.

755
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:16,109
You like ice cream?

756
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,777
Yeah.

757
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,445
So, you know
Greg from class?

758
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,781
I've known Greg
ever since we were little.

759
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:24,516
You know, I was in
y'all kindergarten, right?

760
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,217
Really?

761
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,751
Mmm-hmm. I remember you.

762
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,786
You was the girl who called
Justin Jones perverted...

763
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:32,221
...for showing girls
the birthmark on his butt.

764
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,223
Oh, my God, yes!

765
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:35,824
Yeah, dude came running up,

766
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,926
showed you his butt.
You were calm.

767
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:40,495
Said, "Justin, only perverts
show their butts."

768
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:41,696
I was right there.

769
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:43,798
I can't believe
you remember that.

770
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,901
You a hero. Shut his
perverted ass right down.

771
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:48,302
I never forget it.

772
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:51,438
So you and Greg are coworkers?

773
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,939
Naw, we friends.

774
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:55,541
He just hates calling people
his friend. Dude's got issues.

775
00:36:55,543 --> 00:36:58,310
Yeah, he does.
What's going on?

776
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,712
Man, I don't even know.
It might be his folks.

777
00:37:00,714 --> 00:37:02,647
I mean, dude's mom
always tellin' him

778
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:04,782
how handsome he is,
which he ain't.

779
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:07,484
So now he think he can't trust
anybody close to him.

780
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:08,918
Dude's weird-ass dad

781
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,387
don't socialize with anybody
'cept the cat.

782
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:13,856
So that's a role model
ain't got no friends.

783
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:15,624
Bottom line, dude's terrified

784
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:17,626
of callin' somebody
his friend...

785
00:37:17,628 --> 00:37:19,828
...and they sayin', "Hey, bro,
I'm not your friend."

786
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,329
Then he'd have to kill himself.

787
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:23,297
But how are you coworkers?

788
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:25,632
We, um, we make films.

789
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:27,733
Movies?

790
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:30,502
Yeah. We been making them
for a few years now.

791
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:32,370
We have, like, 42 in total.

792
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:34,772
Greg! You never told me.

793
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:36,306
Well, we never told
anybody 'bout them.

794
00:37:36,308 --> 00:37:38,308
They suck.
I mean, they're terrible.

795
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,510
I'm pretty sure they don't suck.

796
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:42,432
Well, you can see
for yourself if you want.

797
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:44,312
Are you sure?

798
00:37:44,314 --> 00:37:45,313
Hell, yeah,
don't even worry about it.

799
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:46,480
Just don't tell nobody.

800
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,562
No, of course,
I won't.

801
00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:50,616
All right, son,
get on your feet.

802
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:51,618
Sounds good.

803
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:53,750
Where are we going?

804
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,840
We can walk you home.

805
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,274
He needs to recover,

806
00:38:24,276 --> 00:38:26,196
and you probably
should look after him.

807
00:38:27,544 --> 00:38:28,744
Peace, peace.

808
00:38:28,746 --> 00:38:30,586
Thanks.
Bye.

809
00:38:33,448 --> 00:38:35,549
Goddamn it, Earl.

810
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:37,350
Son, don't even start.

811
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:38,551
Pig's foot.

812
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:46,324
<i>So, we're pretty far
into this stupid story now...</i>

813
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,626
<i>...and you're probably
saying to yourself,</i>

814
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:50,594
<i>"Hey. I like this girl Rachel.</i>

815
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:53,363
<i>"And I'm gonna be pissed
if she dies at the end."</i>

816
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:56,399
<i>don't freak out. She survives.</i>

817
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:59,635
<i>So, hopefully,
that reassures you.</i>

818
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:03,838
<i>Although, actually,
why would it?</i>

819
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,974
I'm just overwhelmed
with your enthusiasm today.

820
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:08,442
I guess we're just gonna have
to do it

821
00:39:08,444 --> 00:39:09,943
the old-fashioned way.

822
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:12,578
I'm thinking of one of you.

823
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,979
I'm not gonna mention
any names,

824
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:15,814
but your initials...

825
00:39:15,816 --> 00:39:17,549
...are Scott Mayhew.

826
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:19,584
Greg's been telling everyone

827
00:39:19,586 --> 00:39:21,052
your soup has marijuana in it.

828
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,920
I didn't tell anyone.

829
00:39:22,922 --> 00:39:24,521
I heard you bellowing about it
on public transit.

830
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:26,022
Is that a fact, Greg?

831
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:31,861
Look, yesterday,
Earl and I got stoned somehow.

832
00:39:31,863 --> 00:39:33,729
And it was after
we both ate your soup.

833
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:34,963
And we didn't smoke
any marijuana,

834
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:36,798
which I have never done, so...

835
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,099
Your soup
must have drugs in it,

836
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:39,767
'cause that was the only thing
we both ate...

837
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:41,368
...other than some cookies
we got from Ill Phil,

838
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,669
the drug dealer.

839
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,639
Aha.

840
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:48,974
Man, how did you not know
it was the cookies?

841
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:51,910
Man, it was your dumb ass
yelling that shit on the bus.

842
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:53,478
Yo, Greg!

843
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,079
Did you snitch on me?

844
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:56,513
He did snitch on you!

845
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:58,681
I was there.

846
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:00,649
I heard you ridiculing me

847
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:02,011
in front of
your loathsome harem.

848
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:05,953
You have made...
a mortal enemy.

849
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:07,854
And I will never stop
hounding you.

850
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:10,389
Yeah, you made two mortal
enemies. I stabbed a dude.

851
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,857
Jesus.

852
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,486
So they haven't really
done anything.

853
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:48,688
It's been about a month now.

854
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,424
They did say they're never
gonna stop hounding me...

855
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:53,959
...so, sooner or later...
you know...

856
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:55,093
...gonna get hounded.

857
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,998
Sorry, next time
I'll bring you some flowers.

858
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:04,934
Though I don't even know
where I'd put them.

859
00:41:04,936 --> 00:41:07,176
It's like, like the only place
left is the barf bucket.

860
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:11,705
Flowers.

861
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,741
Where you barf.

862
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,013
I like that hat.

863
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,148
It's pretty cute.

864
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,724
Look, I've never been
very beautiful...

865
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,626
...and that's fine because
that's not important to me.

866
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,093
But...

867
00:41:42,163 --> 00:41:43,863
I thought it'd be
easier looking like this.

868
00:41:43,865 --> 00:41:44,997
It's just not.

869
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:51,002
Everyone comes in here
and sees me...

870
00:41:51,004 --> 00:41:52,970
...and they're
so clearly repulsed.

871
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:56,772
It's so much harder
than I thought it would be.

872
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,573
Hey, come on.

873
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,507
You look good.

874
00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:04,777
I'm ugly, Greg! I'm so ugly.

875
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:06,745
Everyone feels like they have
to lie to me and no one

876
00:42:06,747 --> 00:42:09,447
realizes how insulting that is.

877
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:11,449
Everyone thinks they're
helping, and they're not.

878
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:28,197
Here.

879
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,899
That one's called <i>Mono Rash.</i>

880
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:33,134
It's based on <i>Rashomon</i>
by Kurosawa.

881
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,568
Plot's basically
just Earl killing people

882
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,969
'cause he has a rash...

883
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:38,252
...from mono,
you know, the STD.

884
00:42:40,205 --> 00:42:43,073
Anyway, we're supposed
to go work on

885
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:45,508
our homage to <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

886
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,576
Ours is called
<i>A Box O' Lips, Wow,</i>

887
00:42:47,578 --> 00:42:49,458
which is even worse
than <i>Mono Rash.</i>

888
00:42:49,878 --> 00:42:51,979
It's a war movie
where these two guys

889
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,647
take part in the unspeakable
brutality of war...

890
00:42:53,649 --> 00:42:55,915
...and then they find
a box of tulips.

891
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:58,150
Box O' Lips, yeah.
And they're just, "Wow."

892
00:42:58,152 --> 00:43:00,218
They can't get over
how great these tulips are,

893
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,260
it's like,
"A box o' lips, wow!"

894
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:04,220
The worst part is,
tulips might not

895
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:05,721
even be in the budget anymore.

896
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:09,591
I should actually
just stay here

897
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:10,833
and keep you
from watching that.

898
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:13,727
No! I'm fine. Go make it.

899
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:14,929
Okay.

900
00:43:17,497 --> 00:43:19,197
Okay. Have fun watching

901
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,132
this incredibly terrible movie.

902
00:43:21,134 --> 00:43:23,234
Mmm. Have fun

903
00:43:23,236 --> 00:43:25,276
making the next one.
Mmm-hmm.

904
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,825
Hey, white boy!

905
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,359
Why don't you make me a tulip
'fore I have Doopie come down

906
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:52,960
there and eat your face?

907
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:56,196
But no, for real.
Can you make me a tulip?

908
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:57,931
Oh, my God!
Am I on set right now?

909
00:43:57,933 --> 00:43:59,299
Oh, damn!
Oh, my God!

910
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:02,001
Ahh! I can't take it!
Action! Cut!

911
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:05,737
Madison, why are you here?

912
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:07,205
Rachel said that
I could find you here...

913
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:09,073
...and your phone was going
straight to voice mail.

914
00:44:09,075 --> 00:44:11,241
Probably 'cause there ain't
no good service down there!

915
00:44:11,243 --> 00:44:13,243
But I had to get here
'cause I had to let you know.

916
00:44:13,245 --> 00:44:15,912
So, I was visiting Rachel,
and I was giving her a card...

917
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:18,247
...and she was watching
one of your secret movies.

918
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:19,848
Oh, my God.
Wait, did you see any of it?

919
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,216
No! No, she turned it
off immediately.

920
00:44:21,218 --> 00:44:22,850
It was good, it was good.

921
00:44:22,852 --> 00:44:24,084
You know,
you're both Japanese, and...

922
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:25,752
...Earl beheaded you,
and, but then,

923
00:44:25,754 --> 00:44:27,420
she, like, turned it off.

924
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:29,955
But I had a brainstorm. Okay?
I had an amazing brainstorm.

925
00:44:29,957 --> 00:44:33,057
I realized... you need to
make a film for Rachel.

926
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:37,060
What do you think?

927
00:44:37,062 --> 00:44:38,995
It would be like her favorite
thing in the entire world...

928
00:44:38,997 --> 00:44:41,157
...and it's like the most
important thing you could do.

929
00:44:41,198 --> 00:44:42,731
You have to do it.

930
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,302
Yeah, word.

931
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:50,404
"Word"? Like, word,
you'll do it, word?

932
00:44:58,177 --> 00:44:59,710
Yep.

933
00:44:59,712 --> 00:45:00,944
Oh, my God, awesome!

934
00:45:00,946 --> 00:45:02,211
Okay, well,
I can't wait to see it.

935
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:03,453
Um, okay, I gotta go, but...

936
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,400
Cut!

937
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:07,488
That's a wrap!

938
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:08,915
Rolling!

939
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,216
Titties.

940
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:12,684
Goddamn it!

941
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:14,952
<i>In the next few weeks,</i>

942
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:17,154
<i>did I start
making that movie? No.</i>

943
00:45:17,156 --> 00:45:19,089
<i>Because I didn't agree
to make that movie.</i>

944
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,224
<i>All I said was, "Word."</i>

945
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:23,226
<i>"Word" could mean anything.</i>

946
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:24,694
<i>Plus, we had at least
a month or two...</i>

947
00:45:24,696 --> 00:45:28,130
<i>all the terrible films
we'd already made.</i>

948
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:30,999
<i>For example,</i>
A Sockwork Orange.

949
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:57,323
"Droogle"?

950
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:00,491
It's Google for droogs.

951
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:03,860
What's that?

952
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,502
Nothing, just the bane
of my existence.

953
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,031
Which my mom is forcing me
to carry around

954
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:10,332
until I apply
to some colleges.

955
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:13,835
She says it's like a menu

956
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:14,902
for my future,
and I was, like, "Sure.

957
00:46:14,904 --> 00:46:17,037
"A menu that only has food

958
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,272
"that will humiliate me
for four years."

959
00:46:19,274 --> 00:46:23,042
You have to be less
of an idiot about college.

960
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:25,277
Listen, even if you think
people won't like you...

961
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,380
...which is literally
an insane thing to think...

962
00:46:28,382 --> 00:46:30,181
...you're way less exposed
to people in college.

963
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:32,950
High school is 40 hours
of class a week.

964
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:35,919
College is, like, 15 and 20.

965
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,053
And if you don't want to
live with other people,

966
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,355
then go to Pittsburgh State.

967
00:46:39,357 --> 00:46:41,423
Live at home.

968
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:44,292
It's better than
sitting college out

969
00:46:44,294 --> 00:46:45,814
because you irrationally
hate yourself.

970
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:48,228
Not irrationally, though.

971
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,495
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

972
00:46:50,763 --> 00:46:53,931
Right now. Apply early.

973
00:46:53,933 --> 00:46:56,900
Come on. Do it in front of me.
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

974
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:58,142
What if I say no?

975
00:46:59,936 --> 00:47:01,870
I have stage four cancer.

976
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:06,273
So that would be a pretty
dick move. Come on.

977
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:07,275
Fine.

978
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,182
"Why I want to
go... to college."

979
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,387
By Werner Herzog.

980
00:47:26,256 --> 00:47:27,356
The highly selective

981
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:29,257
admissions process...

982
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:32,260
...weeds out the cruel
and the stupid.

983
00:47:32,262 --> 00:47:35,830
So college is unlike
the senseless chaos...

984
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:39,400
...and sickening enormity
of high school.

985
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:42,836
High school is the mouth
of a great demon...

986
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:44,571
...biting and chewing

987
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:46,005
and smushing people in the face.

988
00:47:47,374 --> 00:47:50,008
It is simply overwhelming.

989
00:47:53,846 --> 00:47:55,513
In all seriousness,

990
00:47:55,515 --> 00:47:57,481
I am looking forward
to college...

991
00:47:57,483 --> 00:48:00,250
...because I didn't really
fit in in high school,

992
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,084
because of my weird
rodent face...

993
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,585
No.

994
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:05,354
...and a habit of saying
the dumbest possible shit.

995
00:48:05,356 --> 00:48:06,988
No!

996
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,057
The sheer pastiness
of my complexion...

997
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:14,194
...overwhelms all who behold
it with existential nausea.

998
00:48:14,196 --> 00:48:18,464
"In high school, I never
truly felt comfortable...

999
00:48:19,132 --> 00:48:20,866
"...in my own skin.

1000
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:22,968
"In fact,
I've always been someone...

1001
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:27,505
"...who doesn't
really like themselves.

1002
00:48:27,507 --> 00:48:31,609
"But I think that's because I
have some growing up to do...

1003
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:35,478
"...and college is the place
where I'm going to do it."

1004
00:48:39,015 --> 00:48:40,315
That's way too personal.

1005
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:45,953
Fine, if you want to
see this again...

1006
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:47,487
Okay! Okay!

1007
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:50,623
But only because cancer.

1008
00:48:52,092 --> 00:48:54,426
And you know what? You have to
do this too now. Here.

1009
00:48:55,461 --> 00:48:57,128
Page through this huge,
horrible book

1010
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,395
and find some colleges.

1011
00:48:58,397 --> 00:48:59,637
That's yours now.

1012
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,312
Mmm. It's like a menu
for your future.

1013
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:09,236
Can I finish my movie first?

1014
00:51:30,626 --> 00:51:32,460
So,
if we make this film,

1015
00:51:32,462 --> 00:51:33,542
people are gonna be, like:

1016
00:51:33,995 --> 00:51:35,228
"Oh, Greg and Earl,

1017
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,029
"they're those weird filmmakers.

1018
00:51:37,031 --> 00:51:38,764
"They're always
creepily filming stuff.

1019
00:51:38,766 --> 00:51:40,365
"They'll probably sneak into
your house one night

1020
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:41,733
"and film you
while you're sleeping."

1021
00:51:41,735 --> 00:51:43,234
But people probably
already think that,

1022
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:46,737
So now, I've become
completely conspicuous,

1023
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:48,305
like all the time.

1024
00:51:48,307 --> 00:51:49,639
People look at me and think,

1025
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:51,007
"Filmmaker."
The hell even is this?

1026
00:51:51,009 --> 00:51:52,008
When they're not
already thinking,

1027
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,242
"Cancer girl's boyfriend."

1028
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:54,509
It tastes like a dog's
funky-ass butthole.

1029
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,111
Furthermore,
we agreed to do a film

1030
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,545
that we have no idea
what it should look like...

1031
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,547
...or sound like, or even be.

1032
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:00,648
I mean,
what the hell sort of film

1033
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,816
should we even make? Huh?

1034
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:04,818
I mean, what was I thinking?

1035
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,819
You were thinking
that girl Madison

1036
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:07,320
had nice titties.

1037
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:08,521
I mean,
I like the titties too,

1038
00:52:08,523 --> 00:52:10,389
but now you got a problem.

1039
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:11,656
'Cause I ain't agreed
to do this shit.

1040
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:12,658
You did.

1041
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,626
Are you not gonna
help me make this?

1042
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:18,661
The hell we gonna make, son?

1043
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:21,263
<i>They want fresh inspiration.</i>

1044
00:52:21,265 --> 00:52:22,631
I must tell you,
the richest inspiration

1045
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:24,733
I have ever known was...

1046
00:52:24,735 --> 00:52:27,235
...during my period of
quarantine in the Amazon.

1047
00:52:28,471 --> 00:52:30,270
Where I
and a half dozen other...

1048
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,605
...unfortunates
had nothing to watch...

1049
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:36,508
...but the bristling,
leviathan tarantula...

1050
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,677
...bunched up on
the rotting, flimsy thatch...

1051
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:41,559
...perhaps eight feet
above our faces.

1052
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:45,314
Spiders the size of your fist.

1053
00:52:45,316 --> 00:52:47,783
Their fangs glistening
with venom and...

1054
00:52:47,785 --> 00:52:49,584
...their thousand-fold
black eyes

1055
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,886
shining dully in the gloom.

1056
00:52:51,888 --> 00:52:53,354
In the darkness,
you would hear

1057
00:52:53,356 --> 00:52:55,356
the sudden anguished hiss...

1058
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,292
...of a spider being struck
by an adult leopard wasp...

1059
00:52:58,294 --> 00:52:59,593
...and in their
mortal struggle,

1060
00:52:59,595 --> 00:53:00,894
they would plummet
to one's bed...

1061
00:53:00,896 --> 00:53:03,529
...biting and stinging
and thrashing...

1062
00:53:05,498 --> 00:53:07,338
You know that you can
smoke a hornet?

1063
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:11,535
Okay, so just look at me
when you answer the questions.

1064
00:53:11,537 --> 00:53:13,337
Don't worry
about the camera, all right?

1065
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:16,605
Okay, Denise.

1066
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:18,888
Tell me a little
about Rachel's birth.

1067
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:20,675
Uh, Rachel's birth.

1068
00:53:21,443 --> 00:53:22,876
What an ordeal that was.

1069
00:53:25,545 --> 00:53:27,913
Greg, just...
let me tell you one thing.

1070
00:53:29,482 --> 00:53:30,915
I was a really good mom
to her, you know?

1071
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,183
I really was.

1072
00:53:33,185 --> 00:53:35,585
Some single moms,
their kids grow up too fast...

1073
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,353
...but I always tried to
protect Rachel from that.

1074
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:39,675
I did my very best
to protect her from...

1075
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:43,324
...growing up too quickly,
you know?

1076
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,393
Right.

1077
00:53:46,395 --> 00:53:48,261
And now,
I'm learning that there are...

1078
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:53,231
protect your kid from,
you know?

1079
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:57,007
No matter what you do,
you just...

1080
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:07,309
So, did she have
any favorite toys?

1081
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,311
Before I answer that question,
this is serious...

1082
00:54:10,946 --> 00:54:13,347
...so use your ears
and listen to me.

1083
00:54:14,682 --> 00:54:16,215
I want you
to promise me something

1084
00:54:16,217 --> 00:54:17,816
as I care about you.

1085
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:19,484
You gotta promise me you're
not gonna have a baby...

1086
00:54:19,486 --> 00:54:20,685
...unless you're ready to love

1087
00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:21,886
that baby's mother
your whole life...

1088
00:54:21,888 --> 00:54:23,520
...and this is serious.

1089
00:54:23,522 --> 00:54:26,789
I'm telling you something
that nobody's gonna tell you.

1090
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:30,292
Don't pick a girl
who's push-pull, you know?

1091
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:32,774
You wanna pick somebody
who's gonna love you...

1092
00:54:33,529 --> 00:54:36,230
...and not forget you,
and not...

1093
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:38,665
...leave you for someone
with a big, fat ass.

1094
00:54:39,533 --> 00:54:41,300
So, no favorite toy.

1095
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:42,767
Um...

1096
00:54:42,769 --> 00:54:45,936
Oh, you want to know what?
Here's a favorite toy.

1097
00:54:45,938 --> 00:54:47,470
Scissors.

1098
00:54:47,472 --> 00:54:49,472
When Rachel's father
first left...

1099
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:50,840
...she gathered up
all his books,

1100
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:54,877
...and she rounded 'em up
and she cut them right up.

1101
00:54:54,879 --> 00:54:55,911
Please, don't tell her
I'm telling you,

1102
00:54:55,913 --> 00:54:57,612
she would chop my head off.

1103
00:54:57,614 --> 00:55:00,381
But she just...

1104
00:55:00,383 --> 00:55:02,416
And I was, like, "Atta girl."

1105
00:55:02,418 --> 00:55:05,752
Snip, snip, snip.
She was very mad.

1106
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:08,254
Can we take a little break
and have a little taste?

1107
00:55:08,256 --> 00:55:09,755
You boys are old enough
to have a little taste, right?

1108
00:55:09,757 --> 00:55:11,877
Can we take a teeny break,
just have a little taste?

1109
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:16,360
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.

1110
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:18,962
Greg, will you join us?

1111
00:55:18,964 --> 00:55:20,797
Oh, I'm okay.

1112
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,299
Oh, come on,
don't be a party pooper!

1113
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:28,303
Now we can get back
to our interview.

1114
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:30,571
So, basically,
this whole setup

1115
00:55:30,573 --> 00:55:31,972
is so that, you know...

1116
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:33,840
...I can talk to you,
you can talk to me...

1117
00:55:33,842 --> 00:55:36,442
...and I can see you,
and you can see me.

1118
00:55:36,444 --> 00:55:37,676
Except it's not really me,
it's a phone.

1119
00:55:37,678 --> 00:55:39,377
And I know that
sounds kind of weird,

1120
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:41,445
but it's not.

1121
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:43,980
So, anyway, just treat it
like a get-well card,

1122
00:55:43,982 --> 00:55:45,514
you can look into the lens.

1123
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:47,349
And, uh...

1124
00:55:47,351 --> 00:55:49,284
Yeah, it's a video,
so you know...

1125
00:55:49,286 --> 00:55:50,351
...don't think about it
too hard,

1126
00:55:50,353 --> 00:55:52,286
but just make it good.

1127
00:55:52,288 --> 00:55:53,654
Start whenever you're ready.

1128
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:55,355
Hi, Rachel.

1129
00:55:55,357 --> 00:55:57,724
I guess I don't really
know you that well...

1130
00:55:57,726 --> 00:55:59,859
...but I believe in you.
You can do it.

1131
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:01,827
That's real nice, yo.

1132
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,662
It's so sweet
that your boyfriend

1133
00:56:03,664 --> 00:56:05,397
is doing this for you.

1134
00:56:05,399 --> 00:56:06,931
He must really love you.

1135
00:56:06,933 --> 00:56:08,766
Girl, that ain't her boyfriend.

1136
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:10,567
Oh.

1137
00:56:10,569 --> 00:56:12,602
<i>I know you're Jewish,
but I just wanted you to know</i>

1138
00:56:12,604 --> 00:56:14,670
<i>that God has a plan for you.</i>

1139
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:15,771
<i>You seem like
a really cool person.</i>

1140
00:56:15,773 --> 00:56:17,539
<i>I know we don't really talk.</i>

1141
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,608
<i>But you've got
a lot of friends. And, uh...</i>

1142
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,508
<i>Out of all the people
in this school,</i>

1143
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,843
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

1144
00:56:23,845 --> 00:56:25,845
<i>I believe in you
and you can do it.</i>

1145
00:56:26,479 --> 00:56:27,979
<i>You can do it.</i>

1146
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:29,513
<i>I believe in you.</i>

1147
00:56:30,047 --> 00:56:31,580
<i>You can do it.</i>

1148
00:56:31,582 --> 00:56:32,781
Damn.

1149
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:59,903
<i>So again,</i>

1150
00:56:59,905 --> 00:57:01,738
<i>if this was a touching,
romantic story...</i>

1151
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,906
<i>...we'd obviously fall in love</i>

1152
00:57:03,908 --> 00:57:05,641
<i>and she'd say all the wise,
beautiful things...</i>

1153
00:57:05,643 --> 00:57:08,777
<i>in life's twilight or whatever.</i>

1154
00:57:08,779 --> 00:57:10,645
<i>And then she'd die in my arms.</i>

1155
00:57:16,117 --> 00:57:18,718
<i>But again,
that's not what happened.</i>

1156
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,687
<i>She just got quieter.
And unhappier.</i>

1157
00:57:22,855 --> 00:57:24,422
So, how are you?

1158
00:57:25,557 --> 00:57:26,757
For real.

1159
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:29,559
For real?

1160
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:33,094
Feeling like
you might have been right.

1161
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:37,871
Right when?

1162
00:57:39,066 --> 00:57:40,699
Back in October.

1163
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:43,902
When you thought I was dying.

1164
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:52,508
Well, I mean,
I regret thinking that.

1165
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:55,977
Don't regret it.

1166
00:58:16,562 --> 00:58:18,496
What is that noise?

1167
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,096
It's Regretful Polar Bear.

1168
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:25,100
Polar Bears have
the purest expression

1169
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:27,542
of regret in the animal kingdom.

1170
00:58:28,604 --> 00:58:31,238
Just listen to how haunting
and plaintive they sound.

1171
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:37,642
Don't make me laugh.
Please. It kinda hurts.

1172
00:58:39,177 --> 00:58:40,417
All right.

1173
00:58:50,988 --> 00:58:53,428
Kind of a monster
silence in here.

1174
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:56,624
Yeah.

1175
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:01,227
It's okay to just be silent
for a while.

1176
00:59:04,097 --> 00:59:05,997
<i>Look,</i>

1177
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:07,832
<i>I know you're really
bracing for this sweet girl...</i>

1178
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:10,568
<i>...that you probably
like a lot to die.</i>

1179
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:13,871
<i>Just please bear with me.
She doesn't. She gets better.</i>

1180
00:59:13,873 --> 00:59:15,739
<i>I promise.</i>

1181
00:59:54,911 --> 00:59:57,178
<i>Pretty much all I remember
from that winter...</i>

1182
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,013
<i>...is working on
that stupid film...</i>

1183
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:02,249
<i>that made some kind of sense...</i>

1184
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:03,917
<i>...and knowing the whole time
that I couldn't...</i>

1185
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:07,220
<i>to make the thing
we wanted to make...</i>

1186
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:09,222
<i>...but it wasn't
possible for us.</i>

1187
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,891
<i>That was
an entire winter of my life.</i>

1188
01:00:17,262 --> 01:00:18,762
<i>I mean, obviously,</i>

1189
01:00:18,764 --> 01:00:20,524
<i>I remember visiting Rachel too.</i>

1190
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:23,865
<i>Sometimes she talked,</i>

1191
01:00:23,867 --> 01:00:25,766
<i>and sometimes,
she didn't want to.</i>

1192
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:29,102
<i>When she didn't want to,
I talked.</i>

1193
01:00:29,104 --> 01:00:30,770
<i>Or we watched movies.</i>

1194
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:32,391
<i>Sometimes, she laughed.</i>

1195
01:00:34,106 --> 01:00:35,339
<i>Sometimes, she didn't.</i>

1196
01:00:41,378 --> 01:00:43,946
<i>What I don't remember
is doing schoolwork.</i>

1197
01:00:46,783 --> 01:00:48,943
<i>I did literally zero
schoolwork during this time.</i>

1198
01:00:55,623 --> 01:00:56,623
<i>Not figuratively.</i>

1199
01:00:57,657 --> 01:00:59,958
<i>Literally zero schoolwork.</i>

1200
01:01:04,697 --> 01:01:06,617
<i>That's actually
sort of hard to do.</i>

1201
01:01:25,984 --> 01:01:27,851
So, what's going on at school?

1202
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:32,955
Well, right now,
the whole school looks like a castle...

1203
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:34,957
...'cause everyone's
getting ready

1204
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:36,199
for Medieval Prom.

1205
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,762
I guess everyone's trying
to figure out how to, like...

1206
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,004
...twerk medievally?

1207
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:46,131
Are you going?

1208
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:47,365
No, of course not.

1209
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:49,066
You should go.

1210
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:50,400
No way!

1211
01:01:51,435 --> 01:01:53,235
Have you seen me in a tux?

1212
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:57,438
It's like when they make
a dog wear human clothes.

1213
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,106
Have you seen that?

1214
01:01:59,108 --> 01:02:01,408
It just makes you
really sad to look at.

1215
01:02:04,445 --> 01:02:07,046
Oh, and I don't have
anyone to go with.

1216
01:02:07,048 --> 01:02:08,288
So there's that.

1217
01:02:13,385 --> 01:02:15,386
Unless...

1218
01:02:15,388 --> 01:02:17,121
...you know...
you wanted to...

1219
01:02:17,123 --> 01:02:19,089
Greg, I'm not going to prom.

1220
01:02:19,091 --> 01:02:21,124
I mean, you totally could.

1221
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:22,892
It could be like a,
s-, awesome statement.

1222
01:02:23,226 --> 01:02:25,026
Hey, uh...

1223
01:02:25,028 --> 01:02:27,761
When are you guys
finishing your movie?

1224
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,365
You don't know we're working
on a movie right now.

1225
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,333
You don't have to pretend.

1226
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:37,934
Earl told me you guys
were making a movie for me.

1227
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:41,903
God, yeah...

1228
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:44,905
I guess he probably did.

1229
01:02:46,007 --> 01:02:47,173
I was just asking, because...

1230
01:02:47,175 --> 01:02:49,208
Goddamn it, Earl! Ugh.

1231
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,410
It was just, it was
supposed to be a surprise!

1232
01:02:52,311 --> 01:02:54,278
You know? It's taking forever

1233
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,812
because we really want
to get it right, and...

1234
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:58,447
I'm probably gonna
stop treatment pretty soon.

1235
01:03:03,352 --> 01:03:04,592
What?

1236
01:03:08,856 --> 01:03:10,823
It just isn't
doing me any good.

1237
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:12,791
All it's doing
is making me sicker.

1238
01:03:21,867 --> 01:03:24,235
Yeah, but it...
I mean, if you stop, then...

1239
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:26,136
Well, we'll just
see what happens.

1240
01:03:28,106 --> 01:03:30,172
Well, we know
what's gonna happen, right?

1241
01:03:42,982 --> 01:03:44,848
I know who
you can take to prom.

1242
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:48,938
Who?

1243
01:03:51,354 --> 01:03:52,987
This sexy pillow here.

1244
01:03:52,989 --> 01:03:54,088
Oh, my God, can you just...

1245
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,989
Ooh, Greg,

1246
01:03:55,991 --> 01:03:57,123
this pillow's name is Francesca.

1247
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,290
Don't joke,
I can't deal with that.

1248
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,324
She's a filthy Italian woman.

1249
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:00,566
Please, stop!

1250
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,994
Don't yell at me.

1251
01:04:03,996 --> 01:04:05,495
So, that's it?
Just, to hell with college,

1252
01:04:05,497 --> 01:04:06,429
to hell with growing up?

1253
01:04:06,431 --> 01:04:07,997
Greg, don't.

1254
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:09,264
Rachel, what the hell
is wrong with you?

1255
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:10,832
This is your life!

1256
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,967
Yeah, it is my life.

1257
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:17,270
It's me who has to
lie in bed all day,

1258
01:04:17,272 --> 01:04:18,471
with a shaved head...

1259
01:04:18,473 --> 01:04:20,473
...getting weaker and uglier,

1260
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:24,143
and more miserable,
with no hope in sight.

1261
01:04:24,145 --> 01:04:25,811
I'm the one who
has to suffer through this,

1262
01:04:25,813 --> 01:04:27,813
not you, so don't yell at me.

1263
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,783
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna sit here

1264
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:35,185
and get comfortable
watching you die.

1265
01:04:36,821 --> 01:04:38,981
Okay? I'm not.
I'm not gonna do that.

1266
01:04:39,256 --> 01:04:40,990
So don't ask me to.

1267
01:04:42,258 --> 01:04:44,125
If you can't accept
that I'm going to do

1268
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:46,160
what I want to do
with my life...

1269
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:49,095
...then you're
a terrible friend.

1270
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:52,464
I'm a terrible friend?

1271
01:04:52,466 --> 01:04:53,431
Okay.

1272
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:56,100
You know,
I'm not the one giving up.

1273
01:04:56,102 --> 01:04:57,401
I'm not ruining
my friend's life

1274
01:04:57,403 --> 01:04:59,102
by giving up
on the whole world.

1275
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:01,070
Oh, please, Greg,
you should be overjoyed.

1276
01:05:01,072 --> 01:05:02,337
Now you can
go back to your life

1277
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:04,572
of being invisible
and detached...

1278
01:05:04,574 --> 01:05:06,273
...and self-hating.

1279
01:05:08,976 --> 01:05:10,056
Yeah.

1280
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:13,671
And you can go back
to your life of being dead.

1281
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:17,414
Nice. Really nice.

1282
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,287
This is gonna kill your mom.

1283
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,558
Have you gotten
comfortable with that?

1284
01:05:35,397 --> 01:05:37,531
That doesn't
bother you anymore?

1285
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:38,565
Thinking about your mom?

1286
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:39,933
Get outta here, Greg.

1287
01:05:39,935 --> 01:05:41,601
You've done your time.

1288
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,923
You don't have to hang around
with the sick girl anymore.

1289
01:05:47,374 --> 01:05:49,814
How can you even
say that to me?

1290
01:05:50,476 --> 01:05:53,244
Your mom forced you
to hang out with me.

1291
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:55,012
Earl forced you
to show me your movies.

1292
01:05:55,014 --> 01:05:57,180
Madison forced you
to make a movie about me.

1293
01:05:57,182 --> 01:05:59,282
So, what part of this
did you actually want to do?

1294
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,735
Just... Just do something
nice for me for once

1295
01:06:21,737 --> 01:06:23,436
and just get out.

1296
01:06:49,228 --> 01:06:51,028
<i>Earl!</i>

1297
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,430
This is it!
You've gone too far!

1298
01:06:53,432 --> 01:06:54,631
You've leaked
the unleakable secret

1299
01:06:54,633 --> 01:06:56,299
because you hold nothing sacred.

1300
01:06:56,301 --> 01:06:57,366
'Cause you're a dickhead!

1301
01:06:57,368 --> 01:06:58,633
The foundation of any

1302
01:06:58,635 --> 01:07:00,468
good working partnership
is trust...

1303
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,236
...and I can no longer
trust you in any way.

1304
01:07:02,238 --> 01:07:03,604
You'll leak anything to anyone.

1305
01:07:03,606 --> 01:07:05,172
It's like working
with Julian Assange.

1306
01:07:05,174 --> 01:07:07,107
Assangde. Ass-andge.
Damn it!

1307
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:22,722
The hell you want?

1308
01:07:22,724 --> 01:07:24,764
Just waiting for Earl.
Awright, awright.

1309
01:07:25,425 --> 01:07:27,292
Whassup, boy?
You gonna come in?

1310
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,527
So, Rachel told me that
you told her about the, uh...

1311
01:07:29,529 --> 01:07:31,649
...about the film
that we're making for her.

1312
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:34,697
You're like Julian Assange, man.

1313
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:36,331
It's like you always do this...

1314
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,665
I don't know,
'cause you, like,

1315
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:39,299
wanna be a better friend
than me or something?

1316
01:07:39,301 --> 01:07:40,433
I don't know if I can
work with you again

1317
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:41,534
after you sell me out
like a dick!

1318
01:07:41,536 --> 01:07:43,602
Oh, okay. Watch out, yo.

1319
01:07:45,037 --> 01:07:47,271
Hey, yo,
shut your ass up, man!

1320
01:07:47,273 --> 01:07:48,572
Like you care so much about
what other people think,

1321
01:07:48,574 --> 01:07:49,706
boy, you go around here...

1322
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,174
...kissin' everybody ass,

1323
01:07:51,176 --> 01:07:54,610
Look, nobody
gives a shit about you, Greg!

1324
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,677
All right? Nobody give a shit!

1325
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:57,378
Whoop his ass!

1326
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:59,546
And then the one girl
who do actually care about you...

1327
01:07:59,548 --> 01:08:00,747
...you wanna come
over here and

1328
01:08:00,749 --> 01:08:03,483
bitch and whine
about some films, yo? Huh?

1329
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:05,785
Because somebody
actually cares about you?

1330
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:07,353
Like, damn,
I'm so tired of you

1331
01:08:07,355 --> 01:08:09,188
treating this girl
like she a burden.

1332
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,089
You know,
her life is over after this!

1333
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:12,457
And you want to come over here

1334
01:08:12,459 --> 01:08:15,526
bitchin' and whinin' about
some irrelevant bullshit!

1335
01:08:15,528 --> 01:08:17,394
Like, yo, you so close to me
knocking your shit loose right now, son!

1336
01:08:17,396 --> 01:08:18,762
Go for it!

1337
01:08:18,764 --> 01:08:21,831
Yeah, I don't care!
You want me to hit you now?

1338
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:23,632
Yeah, Earl, I want you to!

1339
01:08:23,634 --> 01:08:26,034
That's right! Jack that
little dude up there!

1340
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:32,437
See, Greg?

1341
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:35,273
You lucky that was him
and not me out there...

1342
01:08:35,275 --> 01:08:37,308
...'cause I'd have been
whooping your ass up and down this street.

1343
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,670
It'd have been a ass-whoopin'
fest around here, you dig?

1344
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:51,252
So what's the status
on the 20-pager on Nixon?

1345
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:56,155
Uh, I need another extension.

1346
01:08:56,157 --> 01:08:58,257
That might prove difficult...

1347
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,826
...seeing how it's the...

1348
01:09:00,828 --> 01:09:02,628
...the end of the quarter
and all.

1349
01:09:03,195 --> 01:09:05,762
Yeah, I've just been busy.

1350
01:09:07,865 --> 01:09:09,565
You know, I heard...

1351
01:09:13,269 --> 01:09:14,509
...about Rachel.

1352
01:09:15,671 --> 01:09:17,204
How you holding up?

1353
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:22,681
You know...

1354
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,210
...not great.

1355
01:09:30,883 --> 01:09:34,619
You know, my dad died
when I was 15, Greg.

1356
01:09:34,621 --> 01:09:37,321
A couple years
younger than you.

1357
01:09:37,323 --> 01:09:39,823
You know, the thing is that,
when I was a kid...

1358
01:09:40,858 --> 01:09:43,626
...I really,
I really can only remember

1359
01:09:43,628 --> 01:09:45,728
thinking about him as this...

1360
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:48,597
...you know, big,
kind of like asshole guy.

1361
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:52,633
At his wake,
these buddies of his

1362
01:09:52,635 --> 01:09:53,900
kept coming up to me...

1363
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:56,802
...and telling me
these stories about him.

1364
01:09:56,804 --> 01:09:58,804
And it was like
they were talking about

1365
01:09:58,806 --> 01:10:00,472
some complete other guy.

1366
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:03,641
To give you an example.

1367
01:10:04,776 --> 01:10:07,711
He knew every single
European pop song

1368
01:10:07,713 --> 01:10:09,345
from the 1970s.

1369
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:12,814
He'd memorize these songs,

1370
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:14,882
and he'd do that
so he could go...

1371
01:10:14,884 --> 01:10:17,417
...and sing them
to German girls in bars.

1372
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,219
He had a go-to,

1373
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:22,354
his number one
go-to song. It was a...

1374
01:10:23,756 --> 01:10:27,491
It was a Dutch song.
It was called <i>Ding-a-Dong.</i>

1375
01:10:29,694 --> 01:10:32,762
My dad used to sing that
to German girls in bars.

1376
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:35,664
That's a fact.

1377
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:41,169
So what does that mean?

1378
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,566
Well, Greg, I think that
it just means that...

1379
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:49,875
...even after somebody dies,
you can...

1380
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:53,497
...you can still
keep learning about them.

1381
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:56,847
You know, their life.

1382
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:01,851
It can keep unfolding
itself to you just as long...

1383
01:11:03,453 --> 01:11:05,693
...just as long as
you pay attention to it.

1384
01:11:06,956 --> 01:11:08,389
Are you seriously
trying to turn this

1385
01:11:08,391 --> 01:11:10,557
into some stupid sappy lesson?

1386
01:11:12,926 --> 01:11:14,626
You're a good kid, Greg.

1387
01:11:14,628 --> 01:11:16,828
No! Look, I'm going home.

1388
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:21,365
See, I'm cutting class
right in front of you. 'Kay?

1389
01:11:21,367 --> 01:11:23,700
I'm not a good kid. I'm not.

1390
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:41,884
Okay.

1391
01:11:42,985 --> 01:11:45,252
Earl came by earlier
to drop something off...

1392
01:11:45,254 --> 01:11:47,354
...but he turned down
this superb

1393
01:11:47,356 --> 01:11:49,522
Andouille rabbit sausage...

1394
01:11:49,524 --> 01:11:51,257
...which is quite unlike him.

1395
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:53,792
Is everything all right?

1396
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,494
Buddy?

1397
01:12:15,579 --> 01:12:16,812
<i>We tried
a lot of different ways</i>

1398
01:12:16,814 --> 01:12:18,847
<i>of making a film for you...</i>

1399
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:21,583
<i>...but they were all
too goofy or irrelevant...</i>

1400
01:12:21,585 --> 01:12:23,551
<i>...or just not what we wanted.</i>

1401
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:25,619
<i>So, now I'm gonna
talk to you directly.</i>

1402
01:12:26,487 --> 01:12:28,287
<i>Um...</i>

1403
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:30,689
<i>All right, I'm gonna be
honest here. Okay?</i>

1404
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:33,024
<i>Sometimes, white girls
are particularly stupid.</i>

1405
01:12:33,026 --> 01:12:37,495
<i>I mean, everybody's stupid,
but white girls, you know...</i>

1406
01:12:37,497 --> 01:12:39,263
<i>They think
they better than everybody</i>

1407
01:12:39,265 --> 01:12:41,265
<i>and self-centered
and pretend they not.</i>

1408
01:12:41,267 --> 01:12:43,600
<i>But...</i>

1409
01:12:43,602 --> 01:12:45,522
<i>you aren't like that,
you know. Um...</i>

1410
01:12:46,336 --> 01:12:48,437
<i>It's just crazy
how patient you've been.</i>

1411
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:50,639
<i>You know, I know if it was me
that had cancer, uh...</i>

1412
01:12:51,773 --> 01:12:54,474
<i>...I'd be upset and angry</i>

1413
01:12:54,476 --> 01:12:57,510
<i>and trying to beat
everybody's ass half the time.</i>

1414
01:12:57,512 --> 01:13:00,613
<i>So I'm just, I'm just amazed
at how patient you've been.</i>

1415
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:05,050
<i>You, you make me feel blessed.</i>

1416
01:13:15,428 --> 01:13:18,762
<i>By Michael Powell
and Emeric Pressburger.</i>

1417
01:13:20,465 --> 01:13:21,864
<i>I think, ultimately,
what one has to understand</i>

1418
01:13:21,866 --> 01:13:23,599
<i>watching this film...</i>

1419
01:13:23,601 --> 01:13:25,934
<i>...it's a very special
piece of filmmaking.</i>

1420
01:13:25,936 --> 01:13:27,869
Oh.

1421
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:29,503
Are you eating lunch
in here still?

1422
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,939
Not if you are.

1423
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,981
Well, I'm not eating
lunch in here if you are.

1424
01:13:35,709 --> 01:13:38,577
Good,
'cause I like it in here.

1425
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:40,512
So I guess I could just go.

1426
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:42,580
Or you could go.

1427
01:13:43,548 --> 01:13:46,149
No, I like
the air-conditioner.

1428
01:13:46,151 --> 01:13:48,151
And I like
the comfortable chair.

1429
01:13:51,855 --> 01:13:53,922
Yeah, I like those too.

1430
01:13:55,057 --> 01:13:57,158
Sounds like your damn problem.

1431
01:13:59,628 --> 01:14:01,929
<i>Which showed
one film per week...</i>

1432
01:14:01,931 --> 01:14:04,097
<i>...twice a night,
and three times on Saturday.</i>

1433
01:14:05,165 --> 01:14:07,032
<i>In a way,</i>
Tales of Hoffmann <i>is...</i>

1434
01:14:07,034 --> 01:14:11,436
<i>...the culmination of
Powell-Pressburger's work...</i>

1435
01:14:11,438 --> 01:14:13,638
<i>...with what they call
the composed film.</i>

1436
01:14:34,925 --> 01:14:36,792
Hey!

1437
01:14:36,794 --> 01:14:38,114
Can I talk to you
about the movie?

1438
01:14:38,527 --> 01:14:39,793
Um...

1439
01:14:39,795 --> 01:14:41,761
Yeah, it's not done yet.

1440
01:14:41,763 --> 01:14:42,828
Greg, you guys
have been working on it

1441
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,995
for like four months.

1442
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:47,631
Yeah, well...

1443
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:48,565
I don't know,
we tried a bunch of stuff

1444
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,133
and it just...

1445
01:14:50,834 --> 01:14:52,067
...didn't really work.

1446
01:14:52,069 --> 01:14:52,967
It's not that good.

1447
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:54,668
Greg!

1448
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:57,103
Now is not the time for your
"I'm Greg, I suck,

1449
01:14:57,105 --> 01:14:58,771
"nothing I do
is any good" thing.

1450
01:14:58,773 --> 01:15:00,072
I'm sure what you have
is awesome

1451
01:15:00,074 --> 01:15:02,107
and I think she would
really benefit...

1452
01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:04,149
...if you just got it done
and gave it to her.

1453
01:15:05,176 --> 01:15:06,875
Madison,
she stopped treatment.

1454
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:11,279
She gave up.

1455
01:15:13,248 --> 01:15:14,748
She quit.

1456
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:18,684
Well, I guess
that's a really good reason

1457
01:15:18,686 --> 01:15:19,951
to just finish
the fucking movie.

1458
01:15:19,953 --> 01:15:21,152
And give it to her.

1459
01:15:23,555 --> 01:15:24,721
But whatever.

1460
01:15:37,735 --> 01:15:38,968
Honey?

1461
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,803
What?

1462
01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:49,742
Rachel's back
in the hospital, honey.

1463
01:15:54,214 --> 01:15:56,495
Wait, is she starting
treatment again?

1464
01:15:58,817 --> 01:16:00,684
It's not for treatment, honey.

1465
01:16:05,789 --> 01:16:06,789
Oh.

1466
01:16:10,593 --> 01:16:11,893
Mom, what?

1467
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:14,595
Well, I thought
we could go and...

1468
01:16:14,597 --> 01:16:17,297
To force me
to hang out with her?

1469
01:16:17,299 --> 01:16:18,798
Greg, come on.

1470
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,999
Don't worry, Mom,
I'm sure you can find

1471
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:22,161
another girl with cancer
after Rachel dies.

1472
01:16:23,536 --> 01:16:25,069
Which, by the way...

1473
01:16:25,737 --> 01:16:27,204
...she's decided to do.

1474
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:32,241
She's just decided to die...

1475
01:16:32,243 --> 01:16:34,910
...so maybe I can decide
not to visit her.

1476
01:16:40,582 --> 01:16:43,550
I promise you,
you will regret that...

1477
01:16:43,552 --> 01:16:44,632
...if you don't visit her.

1478
01:16:45,954 --> 01:16:47,753
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

1479
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:49,554
Mom, that's probably true.

1480
01:16:49,556 --> 01:16:50,788
But honestly,
I have a shitload of things

1481
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,790
to regret right now.

1482
01:16:52,792 --> 01:16:55,058
I regret not having a date
for tomorrow's stupid prom.

1483
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,794
I regret being too weird
to make friends.

1484
01:16:57,796 --> 01:16:58,961
I definitely regret making

1485
01:16:58,963 --> 01:17:00,629
all those shitty films
with Earl.

1486
01:17:00,631 --> 01:17:02,831
And I assume you saw the email
I got today, from Pitt?

1487
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:05,732
Oh, no? You didn't see it

1488
01:17:05,734 --> 01:17:06,899
while you're going though
all my shit? Here.

1489
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,134
Have a look.

1490
01:17:09,136 --> 01:17:10,635
I'm definitely gonna regret

1491
01:17:10,637 --> 01:17:12,317
doing literally
no school work this year!

1492
01:17:12,604 --> 01:17:13,904
Oh, my God, Greg.

1493
01:17:13,906 --> 01:17:15,939
I know. Admission rescinded,

1494
01:17:15,941 --> 01:17:18,041
due to significant change
in my academic record.

1495
01:17:18,043 --> 01:17:19,909
Oh, well,
no college next year.

1496
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:21,844
I guess I'll just be home,
which sucks for you...

1497
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:22,811
...because it's gonna be
so hard for you

1498
01:17:22,813 --> 01:17:24,612
to go through all my stuff.

1499
01:17:24,614 --> 01:17:26,080
Can you just do me a favor
right now, Mom?

1500
01:17:26,082 --> 01:17:27,748
Just leave me alone. Okay?

1501
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,349
Just let me sit here
and regret stuff.

1502
01:17:29,351 --> 01:17:30,717
I'm just gonna think about

1503
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:31,818
all the things
that I've ever done...

1504
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,252
...and all the things
I haven't done

1505
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:35,694
and just regret the living shit out of it.
Okay?

1506
01:17:40,793 --> 01:17:42,960
All the deadlines
have passed, Victor.

1507
01:17:42,962 --> 01:17:44,227
What's he gonna do next year?

1508
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:45,695
He's just gonna
waste the year?

1509
01:17:45,697 --> 01:17:46,996
He is grieving, honey.

1510
01:17:46,998 --> 01:17:48,297
You have to let him grieve.

1511
01:17:48,299 --> 01:17:49,298
But I can't just sit by

1512
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:51,033
and just let him
ruin his life.

1513
01:17:51,035 --> 01:17:54,236
The universe does not operate

1514
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:55,958
according to a college deadline!

1515
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,223
Can I ask you something?

1516
01:18:17,725 --> 01:18:19,092
Nope.

1517
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:20,726
No. It's not what you think.

1518
01:18:20,728 --> 01:18:21,960
It's just that
prom is tonight and...

1519
01:18:21,962 --> 01:18:24,095
Let me ask you something.
What is this?

1520
01:18:25,063 --> 01:18:26,963
What is up
with the arm touching?

1521
01:18:26,965 --> 01:18:28,164
Are you just being friendly,

1522
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:29,632
or is this some
calculated maneuver...

1523
01:18:29,634 --> 01:18:31,033
...to get me to do
whatever you want?

1524
01:18:31,035 --> 01:18:32,267
'Cause you have to understand

1525
01:18:32,269 --> 01:18:34,035
what it does
when a beautiful, sexy...

1526
01:18:34,037 --> 01:18:35,236
...otherwise
thoughtful girl...

1527
01:18:35,238 --> 01:18:37,137
...touches the arm
of a scrawny, pasty

1528
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:38,304
groundhog-faced kid.

1529
01:18:38,306 --> 01:18:39,405
It's an act of cruelty.

1530
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:41,907
Are you done?

1531
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:43,108
Yeah. Yeah, I'm done.

1532
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,843
I'm done with you.

1533
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,045
I'm done
with this stupid film.

1534
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:48,413
All right? I'm done.

1535
01:18:50,015 --> 01:18:51,715
Yo! But you ain't
done with me!

1536
01:18:51,717 --> 01:18:53,049
I'm back for my revenge

1537
01:18:53,051 --> 01:18:54,316
Stab you in the dick

1538
01:18:54,318 --> 01:18:56,051
Pardon my French

1539
01:18:56,053 --> 01:18:58,386
Really? You're gonna stab me
in the dick? Go ahead.

1540
01:18:58,388 --> 01:18:59,754
Stab me in the dick.

1541
01:18:59,756 --> 01:19:02,423
Just no rapping.
Okay? All right?

1542
01:19:02,425 --> 01:19:03,957
I'll break your eyeball

1543
01:19:03,959 --> 01:19:05,124
with a fist I got clenched

1544
01:19:05,126 --> 01:19:06,925
Shove your body
under another bench

1545
01:19:06,927 --> 01:19:08,726
Stop rapping!

1546
01:19:08,728 --> 01:19:10,728
Knock your teeth out
with the fist I got clenched

1547
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,970
I can't do this if you're
gonna rap the whole time.

1548
01:19:29,844 --> 01:19:30,977
Aw!

1549
01:19:33,814 --> 01:19:34,914
Break it up!

1550
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:36,248
Earl!

1551
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:38,850
Break it up! Break it up!

1552
01:19:38,852 --> 01:19:39,851
I thought you were
eating lunch

1553
01:19:39,853 --> 01:19:41,018
in Mr. McCarthy's office.

1554
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,252
Man, I was,
but he all sad talking

1555
01:19:42,254 --> 01:19:43,386
about German music and shit.

1556
01:19:43,388 --> 01:19:45,688
That's boring as hell, man.

1557
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:48,223
I'm surprised and disappointed
to see you two fighting.

1558
01:19:48,225 --> 01:19:49,958
And, Phillip,
I'm surprised and disappointed

1559
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,259
to see you
back on school grounds...

1560
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:52,893
...after being expelled!

1561
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:54,160
All right, man.

1562
01:19:54,162 --> 01:19:54,994
Please leave the premises.

1563
01:19:54,996 --> 01:19:56,328
Back to class.

1564
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:57,862
Let's go!

1565
01:19:57,864 --> 01:19:59,997
Maxwell, Ryan, Soledad,

1566
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:02,265
stop gawking and start walking!

1567
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,903
Greg!

1568
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:11,238
Yo, babe!
You see me pummel this bitch?

1569
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,472
Come on and keep walking

1570
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,174
'fore I can whoop
that ass again, man.

1571
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:15,508
Madison, what?

1572
01:20:16,576 --> 01:20:18,043
Come to prom with me.

1573
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:22,112
I know the whole
movie situation

1574
01:20:22,114 --> 01:20:23,913
was really difficult for you...

1575
01:20:23,915 --> 01:20:25,995
...and I kind of feel like
it was my fault.

1576
01:20:26,549 --> 01:20:27,949
So I just kind of wanted to

1577
01:20:27,951 --> 01:20:30,271
make it up to you
a little bit.

1578
01:20:31,519 --> 01:20:33,319
Is this a pity date?

1579
01:20:33,321 --> 01:20:34,586
No.

1580
01:20:34,588 --> 01:20:36,120
No, it's not a pity date.

1581
01:20:38,089 --> 01:20:39,289
Greg, just come
to prom with me.

1582
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,531
I think we'd have a good time.

1583
01:20:43,527 --> 01:20:45,427
Told you you would get a date.

1584
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:47,295
Yep.

1585
01:20:53,134 --> 01:20:55,969
So you're welcome.
For the tux and everything.

1586
01:20:57,237 --> 01:20:58,403
Thanks, Mom.

1587
01:21:13,852 --> 01:21:16,453
I'm very upset
about this college thing.

1588
01:21:18,322 --> 01:21:19,955
But your father and I can wait

1589
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:22,437
till you're ready
to talk about it.

1590
01:21:23,859 --> 01:21:25,125
I appreciate that.

1591
01:21:28,162 --> 01:21:29,962
Don't forget your corsage.

1592
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:34,066
All right.

1593
01:21:39,905 --> 01:21:42,239
My handsome boy...

1594
01:21:42,241 --> 01:21:43,873
...going to prom.

1595
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,611
Take lots of pictures, okay?

1596
01:22:07,496 --> 01:22:08,561
302 Halket Street.

1597
01:22:09,095 --> 01:22:10,528
What's that?

1598
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:12,062
I said 302 Halket Street.

1599
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:14,163
Huh?

1600
01:22:14,165 --> 01:22:15,564
302 Halket Street.

1601
01:22:15,566 --> 01:22:17,432
Halket? Okay.
Okay.

1602
01:22:17,434 --> 01:22:19,100
You got it, baby.

1603
01:22:19,102 --> 01:22:20,568
So you love this girl?

1604
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,204
Uh, no.
I wouldn't go that far.

1605
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:25,904
What?

1606
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:27,939
No. I... No.

1607
01:22:27,941 --> 01:22:29,006
Yeah, so you guys
are gonna be getting busy

1608
01:22:29,008 --> 01:22:30,941
on my brand new Tuscan leather?

1609
01:22:30,943 --> 01:22:32,976
No. I think...
Huh?

1610
01:22:32,978 --> 01:22:34,577
No, we're not.
I don't think so.

1611
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:36,512
Nah, I'm just
playing with you.

1612
01:22:36,514 --> 01:22:38,514
But I do hope you get some.

1613
01:22:38,516 --> 01:22:40,449
It's really gonna depend
on what she wants to do.

1614
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:41,450
If you really love her,
though,

1615
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:43,018
you definitely got a shot.

1616
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:44,386
Because she'll know.

1617
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:46,954
She is fine though?

1618
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:49,489
Huh?

1619
01:23:52,317 --> 01:23:53,417
Hey.

1620
01:23:57,355 --> 01:23:58,621
I know, I look amazing.

1621
01:24:03,559 --> 01:24:05,293
Can I put some flowers on you?

1622
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:22,041
Like that.

1623
01:24:30,016 --> 01:24:31,176
Okay.

1624
01:24:32,117 --> 01:24:34,785
Before we watch this...

1625
01:24:34,787 --> 01:24:37,087
...I'm sorry
it took so long to make.

1626
01:24:37,089 --> 01:24:39,589
But the reason is...

1627
01:24:39,591 --> 01:24:42,358
...just couldn't figure out
how to get it to not suck.

1628
01:24:43,727 --> 01:24:46,795
But... we never really
did figure it out.

1629
01:24:46,797 --> 01:24:48,229
It still sucks.

1630
01:24:53,067 --> 01:24:55,101
It's not exactly
what I wanted to say to you.

1631
01:25:01,707 --> 01:25:02,707
But...

1632
01:25:04,209 --> 01:25:06,076
...whatever.

1633
01:25:06,078 --> 01:25:08,038
Let's just
watch this first, okay?

1634
01:28:21,502 --> 01:28:22,969
Hey, should I get a nurse?

1635
01:28:24,972 --> 01:28:26,973
Denise! Denise!

1636
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:41,480
<i>That was the last time
I saw Rachel.</i>

1637
01:29:42,782 --> 01:29:45,016
<i>She went into a coma
shortly after that,</i>

1638
01:29:45,018 --> 01:29:46,484
<i>and died about 10 hours later.</i>

1639
01:29:49,754 --> 01:29:51,714
<i>I know I told you
she doesn't die.</i>

1640
01:29:52,389 --> 01:29:53,655
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

1641
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,090
<i>Deep down...</i>

1642
01:29:56,092 --> 01:29:58,659
<i>...somehow,
I didn't think she would.</i>

1643
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,694
<i>But she did.</i>

1644
01:33:28,263 --> 01:33:30,197
<i>Dear Greg,
I heard what happened</i>

1645
01:33:30,199 --> 01:33:31,665
<i>with your class work.</i>

1646
01:33:31,667 --> 01:33:32,999
<i>And with Pitt State.</i>

1647
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,867
<i>So, I wrote them a letter,</i>

1648
01:33:35,869 --> 01:33:37,949
<i>trying to convince them
to let you back in.</i>

1649
01:33:38,803 --> 01:33:41,938
<i>There's a copy in here,
if you want to read it.</i>

1650
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:43,739
<i>Hopefully, it works,
because that would mean...</i>

1651
01:33:43,741 --> 01:33:46,675
<i>...I have powers
from beyond the grave.</i>

1652
01:33:46,677 --> 01:33:48,958
<i>But you should probably
send them something too.</i>

1653
01:33:50,579 --> 01:33:53,881
<i>Goodbye, Greg.
You're a good friend.</i>

1654
01:33:53,883 --> 01:33:54,982
<i>Although if you don't
go to college,</i>

1655
01:33:54,984 --> 01:33:56,616
<i>you're also an idiot.</i>

1656
01:33:56,618 --> 01:33:58,150
<i>But you already knew that.</i>

1657
01:33:59,152 --> 01:34:00,285
<i>Love, Rachel.</i>

1658
01:34:02,788 --> 01:34:06,157
<i>I'd also like for you
to take some of my pillows.</i>

1659
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,859
<i>They'll want a good home
where they'll be loved.</i>

1660
01:34:08,861 --> 01:34:10,827
<i>Not in the way you're thinking,</i>

1661
01:34:10,829 --> 01:34:11,869
<i>that's disgusting.</i>

1662
01:37:47,107 --> 01:37:49,341
<i>Dear Pittsburgh
State Admissions:</i>

1663
01:37:49,343 --> 01:37:51,042
<i>I'm writing
on behalf of someone</i>

1664
01:37:51,044 --> 01:37:52,810
<i>who gave me
half a year of his life...</i>

1665
01:37:52,812 --> 01:37:54,077
<i>...at the time when I was at</i>

1666
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:56,312
<i>my most difficult to be around.</i>

1667
01:37:56,314 --> 01:37:58,447
<i>He has a very
low opinion of himself,</i>

1668
01:37:58,449 --> 01:37:59,514
<i>which is why
I think it's necessary...</i>

1669
01:37:59,516 --> 01:38:00,982
<i>...that you hear from someone</i>

1670
01:38:00,984 --> 01:38:03,084
<i>who sees him
as he actually is:</i>

1671
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:05,352
<i>A limitlessly kind,
sweet, giving,</i>

1672
01:38:05,354 --> 01:38:07,387
<i>and genuine person.</i>

1673
01:38:07,389 --> 01:38:09,429
<i>No matter how much
he would deny it.</i>

1674
01:38:10,256 --> 01:38:12,490
<i>The drop in his academic
performance this year...</i>

1675
01:38:12,492 --> 01:38:13,491
<i>...is the consequence
of all the time</i>

1676
01:38:13,493 --> 01:38:17,394
<i>...and the time he spent
making things for me...</i>

1677
01:38:17,396 --> 01:38:19,529
<i>...and how hard
that was for him.</i>

1678
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:21,497
<i>You can ask him about it...</i>

1679
01:38:21,499 --> 01:38:23,532
<i>...but his sort of
over-the-top humility</i>

1680
01:38:23,534 --> 01:38:25,100
<i>will probably get in the way.</i>

1681
01:38:25,102 --> 01:38:29,437
<i>No one has done more
to make me smile than he has.</i>

1682
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:31,005
<i>And no one ever could.</i>

1683
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,423
<i>Rachel's ashes were scattered</i>

1684
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:52,191
<i>in a park behind her house.</i>

1685
01:38:53,327 --> 01:38:55,061
<i>Apparently, she ran away
from home once</i>

1686
01:38:55,063 --> 01:38:56,495
<i>and tried to live there.</i>

1687
01:38:58,364 --> 01:39:01,332
<i>It was this story
her aunt told at the funeral.</i>

1688
01:39:01,334 --> 01:39:03,267
<i>She was trying
to become a squirrel.</i>

1689
01:39:04,369 --> 01:39:05,535
<i>She thought she could
turn into one</i>

1690
01:39:05,537 --> 01:39:07,136
<i>just by being in the forest...</i>

1691
01:39:07,138 --> 01:39:10,272
<i>...and wanting it really bad.</i>

1692
01:39:10,274 --> 01:39:13,375
<i>I guess maybe that's
what Mr. McCarthy meant...</i>

1693
01:39:13,377 --> 01:39:15,977
<i>...about someone's life
continuing to unfold.</i>

1694
01:39:17,412 --> 01:39:19,012
<i>It was weird to be
learning something new</i>

1695
01:39:19,014 --> 01:39:20,546
<i>about Rachel after she died.</i>

1696
01:39:22,148 --> 01:39:24,415
<i>But somehow,
it was reassuring as well.</i>
