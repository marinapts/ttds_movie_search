1
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,194
The thing I've
been asking myself is

2
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,638
what kind of sick individual
names a street Edgewood Way

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,553
and he put it half a mile away
from Edgewood Lane?

4
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,355
Huh?

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,074
It's crazy.

6
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,952
You got me out here in this creepy,
confusing ass suburb.

7
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,038
I'm serious, though.
I feel like a sore thumb out here.

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,753
All right, baby. All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
See you.

10
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,957
Okay,
so this is Rhine Ave.

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,434
It's like a fucking
hedge maze out here.

12
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
East...

13
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,592
Keep going straight and then
I think it said a left on...

14
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,910
What was that?
Peacock?

15
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,073
Go straight and a left on...

16
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,869
Okay.

17
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,871
All right,
just keep on walking, bruh.

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,758
Don't do nothin' stupid.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,273
Just keep on...

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,553
Fuck this. I'mma fucking
go the other way I came.

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,628
Not today. Not me.

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,229
You know how they like to do
motherfuckers out here, man. I'm gone.

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,072
Yo... Come on, brother,
this is...

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,196
Yo! Yo! Hey!

25
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,992
Sid, Sid, Sid.

26
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,308
How's it goin' over there?

27
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Good.

28
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,031
You got your toothbrush?

29
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Check.

30
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,950
Do you have your deodorant?

31
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,519
Check.

32
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,358
Do you have your cozy clothes?

33
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,229
Got that.

34
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,718
Can you give me
a minute, Sid?

35
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,190
We gotta pry something
out of your dad.

36
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
What?

37
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,038
Do they know I'm black?

38
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
No.

39
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,189
Should they?

40
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,318
It seems like it's something
you might wanna, you know,

41
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,355
mention.

42
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,716
"Mom and Dad,
my black boyfriend

43
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,358
"will be coming
up this weekend

44
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,080
"and I just don't
want you to be shocked

45
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,559
"that he's a black man."

46
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,216
You said I was the first
black guy you ever dated.

47
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Yeah, so what?

48
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,390
Yeah, so this is uncharted
territory for them.

49
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,392
You know, I don't wanna get chased
off the lawn with a shotgun.

50
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,959
You're not going to.
First of all,

51
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,072
my dad would've voted for Obama
a third time if he could've.

52
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,557
Like, the love is so real.

53
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,176
I'm only telling you
that 'cause he's definitely

54
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,599
gonna wanna talk
to you about that.

55
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,188
And it will definitely fucking suck.

56
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,194
But that's because he's a lame
dad more than anything else.

57
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,831
They are not racist.

58
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,791
All right.
I would've told you.

59
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,791
I wouldn't be
bringing you home to them.

60
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,856
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Think about that for, like, two seconds.

61
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,915
I'm thinkin'.

62
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,075
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

63
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,193
No, no, no.

64
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,191
Come on, I'm a grown man.
No way.

65
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
You broke my cigarette.

66
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,000
Seriously, you just
threw it out a window?

67
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,416
Just like a dollar. You basically
threw a dollar out the window. Great.

68
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,336
That was a dollar you decided
to spend on nicotine.

69
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,429
Yeah.
Tobacco.

70
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,192
Hold on, I gotta call Rod.

71
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,839
Oh, Rod.

72
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,433
Don't do that.

73
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,475
'Sup?

74
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,755
Yo, you at work?

75
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,199
Yeah, yeah,
I'm at work.

76
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,669
Look, Chris,
tell me this, okay?

77
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,034
How can I get in trouble

78
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,034
for patting down an old lady?
It's standard procedure.

79
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,470
Gary just think 'cause
an elderly bitch is elderly,

80
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,312
she can't hijack no
motherfucking plane.

81
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,080
C, wait, wait, wait.
I know you laughin'.

82
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,593
I'm serious, man.
The next 9/11

83
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,199
is gonna be on
some geriatric shit.

84
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,395
Straight up.

85
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,199
Look, man,
thanks for looking after Sid this weekend.

86
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,918
Remember, no human food.

87
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,399
He's got IBS.

88
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
Damn, C.
Give me some type of credit.

89
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,991
Okay, I don't forget shit.
You do.

90
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,752
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

91
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,480
No, I accept your apology.
It's all good.

92
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,239
How Little
Miss Rosie doin'?

93
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,873
She's good. She's driving.

94
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,155
Can I talk to him?
No.

95
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,753
I'd like to talk
to him, please.

96
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,753
Hold on, hold on.

97
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,153
- Hi, Rod!
- Now, look here.

98
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,920
You know you picked
the wrong guy, right?

99
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,873
Yeah, of course I know that.
This is all just a ploy to get to you.

100
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,696
It's not too late for us.
Okay, get your own girl.

101
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Goddamn.

102
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,856
She's all mad at you 'cause
you never take my advice.

103
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Like what?

104
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,911
Like don't go to
a white girl's parents' house.

105
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,360
What's she doin'?
Lickin' your balls or somethin'?

106
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
Yeah, bye.
You know what I'm sayin', Chris?

107
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Chris.

108
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Chri...

109
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,439
This motherfucker
hung up on me.

110
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
You're jealous.

111
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,271
I'm not jealous.
I made you jealous?

112
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,120
I'm not jealous of Rod.
It's Rod!

113
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,950
Fuck. Are you okay?

114
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,216
Yeah, that scared
the shit outta me.

115
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,309
You?
Yeah, I'm okay.

116
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
All right.

117
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,549
Oh, my God.

118
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,558
Fuck.

119
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,838
Stay here.
What?

120
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,833
What are you doing?

121
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,112
I don't know.

122
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,637
Well, maybe he's gone,
you know?

123
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Chris.

124
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,155
So, in the future, the number to
call is Animal Control Services.

125
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,074
Yes. Sorry about that.
I was just disoriented.

126
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,034
So you guys
coming up from the city?

127
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,078
Yeah, yeah. My parents are
from the Lake Pontaco area.

128
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,231
We're just heading up there
for the weekend. Hmm.

129
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,837
Sir, can I see
your license, please?

130
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,069
Wait, why?

131
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,196
Yeah.
I have state ID.

132
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,555
No, no, no.
He wasn't driving.

133
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,234
I didn't ask who was driving.
I asked to see his ID.

134
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,671
Yeah, why? That doesn't
make any sense. Here.

135
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,936
No, no, no. Fuck that. You
don't have to give him your ID

136
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,256
'cause you haven't
done anything wrong.

137
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,759
Baby, baby, it's okay.
Come on.

138
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,992
Any time there is an incident,
we have every right to ask...

139
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
That's bullshit.

140
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Ma'am...

141
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,856
Everything all right, Ryan?

142
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,953
Yeah, I'm good.

143
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,075
Get that headlight fixed.

144
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,635
And that mirror.

145
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,119
Thank you, Officer.

146
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,315
What?

147
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,919
That was hot.

148
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,799
Well, I'm not gonna
let anyone fuck with my man.

149
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,912
I see that.
Okay.

150
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,159
We're here.

151
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,519
It's the groundskeeper.

152
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Are you ready?

153
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,595
Hi!

154
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,835
My little girl!
Come here!

155
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,918
How are you? I love you too.
I missed you.

156
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,513
This is my dad, Dean.
This is Chris.

157
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,079
Call me Mr. Armitage.

158
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,376
Of course.
How you doin'?

159
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,358
I'm kiddin'! You call me Dean.
And you hug me, my man.

160
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,033
How are ya?
I'm good. How are you?

161
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,519
We're huggers.
Yes.

162
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,880
This is my mom.
This is Chris.

163
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,353
Hi, welcome.

164
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,352
Nice to meet you.

165
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,272
Your father gets
really excited, but...

166
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,916
Anyway, yeah.
I'm Missy.

167
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,031
Yes. Come on in.
Please, welcome. Inside.

168
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
So how was your drive in?

169
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,828
It was fine.
We actually hit a deer.

170
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,558
What?
Oh, no.

171
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,073
Is it dead?
Yeah.

172
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,071
That's horrible.
Are you guys all right?

173
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,276
Yeah.
It just fruck us out.

174
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
It did?

175
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,376
Yeah. It came outta nowhere.
We got it pretty good.

176
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,119
Yeah, it must have
frucked you out, big time.

177
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,556
Frucking weird. Well, you
know what I say?

178
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,433
I say one down, a couple
hundred thousand to go.

179
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Dean.
Dad.

180
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,896
No, I don't mean to get on my
high horse, but I'm telling ya,

181
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,071
I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it.
They're taking over.

182
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,628
They're like rats.
They're destroying the ecosystem.

183
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,056
I see a dead deer on the side
of the road, I think to myself,

184
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,433
"That's a start."

185
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,279
I don't even
understand that.

186
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,400
I'm sorry.
I'm just sayin'.

187
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,711
You know what, I am grateful
for what you've done today.

188
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,273
I don't like 'em.

189
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,509
We got that.

190
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,635
Okay.
Yeah.

191
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,792
All right, you guys
look so wiped out.

192
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,592
Yeah, a little.
Yeah.

193
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,272
So how long has this
been going on? This...

194
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
This thang?

195
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,914
How long?

196
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
Four months.

197
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,555
Four months?

198
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,470
Mmm.
Five months, actually.

199
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,633
She's right, I'm wrong.

200
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,950
Attaboy. Better get
used to saying that.

201
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,759
Please, I'm so sorry.

202
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,956
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She's right, I'm wrong.

203
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
See?

204
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,116
Does he have an off button?
This is exhausting.

205
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,800
I know.
I wanna give you a tour.

206
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,638
They just got...
Can we unpack first?

207
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,314
You wanna unpack?
Before the tour?

208
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,590
This is Missy's office.
She takes appointments in there.

209
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,079
She's a therapist,
right?

210
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,309
Psychiatrist, yeah.

211
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,708
Turns out people up here

212
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,616
are just as messed up in the
head as they are in the city.

213
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,914
This is Jeremy.

214
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,276
That's Rose's little brother.
There he is.

215
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,157
I've heard stories.

216
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,673
Yeah, I bet you have.

217
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,190
He's studying medicine now.
Wants to be just like his old man.

218
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,952
You'll meet him.
All right. Cool.

219
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,991
I picked these up in Bali.

220
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,393
It's pretty eclectic.
I'm a traveler and I can't help it.

221
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,193
I keep bringing
souvenirs back.

222
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,713
It's such
a privilege to be able

223
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,398
to experience
another person's culture.

224
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,840
You know what I'm saying?
Mmm-hmm.

225
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,678
Oh, you're gonna
love this.

226
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,398
My dad's claim to fame.

227
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,592
He was beat by Jesse Owens

228
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,195
in the qualifying round for
the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

229
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,376
Those are the ones where...
Owens won in front of Hitler.

230
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,958
Yeah, what a moment.
What a moment.

231
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,511
I mean, Hitler's up there with all
his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

232
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,869
This black dude
comes along,

233
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,076
proves him wrong in front
of the entire world.

234
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,389
Amazing.

235
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,874
Tough break for
your dad though.

236
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,109
Yeah.

237
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,591
He almost got over it.

238
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,949
That's the basement.
We had to seal it up.

239
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,951
We got some black
mold down there.

240
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,109
My mother loved her kitchen,
so we keep a piece of her in here.

241
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,799
Georgina, this is Chris.
This is Rose's boyfriend.

242
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Hi.

243
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,039
Hello.

244
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,593
The garbage goes
under the sink,

245
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,231
and now for the
pièce de résistance,

246
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,759
the field of play.

247
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I love it.

248
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,638
The nearest house
is across the lake.

249
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,239
It's total privacy.

250
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,913
I know what
you're thinking.

251
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
What?

252
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,428
Come on, I get it.

253
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,034
White family,
black servants.

254
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,189
It's a total cliché.

255
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,480
I wasn't gonna
take it there.

256
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,272
Well, you didn't have to.
Believe me.

257
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,794
No.

258
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,352
We hired Georgina and Walter
to help care for my parents.

259
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
When they died,

260
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,351
I couldn't bear to
let them go. I mean...

261
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,671
But, boy, I hate
the way it looks.

262
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,232
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

263
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,192
By the way, I would have voted for
Obama for a third term if I could.

264
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,590
Best president in my lifetime.
Hands down.

265
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,153
I agree.
Yeah.

266
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,471
So what do your
parents do, Chris?

267
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,473
Uh...

268
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,312
My dad wasn't
really in the picture.

269
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,232
My mom passed
away when I was 11.

270
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,391
Oh, I'm sorry.
How did she die?

271
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,788
A hit and run.

272
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,114
That's awful.

273
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,316
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
You were young.

274
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,109
Actually, I don't remember a
lot from that time, so...

275
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,115
Well, that's okay. We don't
have to talk about that.

276
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,673
You smoke, Chris?

277
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Mmm-hmm.

278
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
You jonesing
a little bit over there, huh?

279
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm quitting.

280
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,359
Dad, this is why I don't bring
people to the house anymore.

281
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,034
That's okay.
We're not judging. We're not.

282
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,679
That's a nasty habit,
though.

283
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,880
You should have Missy take
care of that for you.

284
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
How?

285
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
Hypnosis.

286
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,918
She developed a method, and I'm
telling you, it works like a charm.

287
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Wow, um...

288
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,176
Some people
don't want strangers

289
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,416
messing around in
their heads, guys.

290
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,876
Listen, Chris, I thought
it was total bullshit.

291
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,315
I smoked cigarettes
for 15 years.

292
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,755
I loved every
goddamn puff I took.

293
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,114
She puts me under once...

294
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,760
The sight of a cigarette
makes me want to vomit.

295
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,719
Okay, fall back, Dean.

296
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,950
It's a service we provide.

297
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,152
I'm good, actually.

298
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,336
Yes.
Thank you, though.

299
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,376
Well, smoker or not,
we're thrilled to have you up here

300
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,072
for the big get-together.
Yeah.

301
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,071
Wait, holy shit.
That's this weekend?

302
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
Yes, this weekend.

303
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,913
What get-together?
Oh, my God.

304
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,354
Thanks, George.

305
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,752
It's Rose's grandfather's party.

306
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,158
My dad would throw
a shindig once a year.

307
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,038
Get all his friends together,

308
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,236
bocce ball, badminton...

309
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,516
Wait, why didn't you
guys tell me about this?

310
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,951
Well, it's the same day
every year, sweetheart.

311
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,758
- No, it's not.
- Um...

312
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,354
It is.
Actually, it is.

313
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Is it really?

314
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,856
- Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong.
- Yeah.

315
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,429
We just kept it up because after
they died, it felt like...

316
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,918
We keep them close to us.

317
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,439
Yeah, they're still with us.

318
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,830
I just wanted to
have a chill weekend.

319
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,593
Sounds like fun, actually.

320
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Oh, Georgina.

321
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,189
I'm so sorry.

322
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,355
That's okay.

323
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,237
Why don't you go lay down?
Just get some rest.

324
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,030
Yes, I think I will.

325
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,919
Good.

326
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,949
My God, it must be very...

327
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,439
'Sup, fam!

328
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,314
Hey, Jer-Bear.

329
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,072
Hi, darling.
Hey, buddy.

330
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,790
Nobody answers
the door around here?

331
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,869
Hey, Rosie.

332
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,576
Why would I lie, huh?

333
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
I love it!

334
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,750
Did she tell you about
her toenail collection?

335
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,439
What?
Oh, my God!

336
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,753
She used to bite 'em off, suck on 'em,
and save 'em in a jewelry box.

337
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,880
No, I didn't. I don't know
what you're talking about.

338
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,160
That is so disgusting.

339
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,355
I fucking hate you.

340
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,078
Okay, here's a good one.

341
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,436
Uh, let me set the scene.
It was our junior year.

342
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,279
Rose has a crush on this guy,
Conner Garfield.

343
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Conner Garfield.

344
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,675
No. Mom?

345
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,990
No, Jeremy, stop.

346
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,917
No, no, these are good.

347
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,115
I want to hear them.

348
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,038
Yeah, Rose,
where are your manners?

349
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,276
Our guest wants to
hear the stories, please.

350
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
Thank you.

351
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,153
So Conner's from my lacrosse team, right?
Huge kid, like 6'3".

352
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,788
And he's pretty dumb, right?
So we threw this party.

353
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,029
You threw a party.

354
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,476
I think my parents
were in Greece or something.

355
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,995
We raided their liquor cabinet
and we're all shit-faced.

356
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Like 15 of us.

357
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,470
Oh, my God. Tell me
this isn't true, Rose.

358
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Yeah.

359
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,917
I filled the liquor
bottles with water...

360
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,595
And let me finish?

361
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,195
Uh-huh. Go ahead.
I'm curious.

362
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,116
So I'm upstairs hooking up with the
hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.

363
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Oh, God.

364
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,878
You realize you're
coming off as, like,

365
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,558
the world's
biggest douchebag, right?

366
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,270
So Conner starts banging
on the bathroom door, right?

367
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,879
I open it

368
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,838
and blood's gushing from his mouth.
And he's screaming,

369
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,474
"Your sister
bit my fucking tongue off!"

370
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,278
- You bit him?
- What?

371
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,159
Okay, to be fair,
it was my first kiss

372
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,073
and he slipped some tongue
and I was not expecting it.

373
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,913
It was a reflex.
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,275
A reflex that I have
since gotten rid of.

375
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,896
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you better be careful.

376
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,309
Yeah, I'm very careful now.

377
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,440
I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean,
maybe clean it up just a little bit?

378
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,512
So, Chris, what's your sport?
Football? Baseball?

379
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,791
Basketball, mostly, I guess.

380
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,234
You an MMA fan?

381
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,869
Dude.

382
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
"Dude" what?

383
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
What?

384
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,150
Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone
else have the floor for a second?

385
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,430
You're dating
my sister, right?

386
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,829
He's dating my sister.
You had your chance.

387
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,358
I can't get to know
the guy?

388
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,674
You mean like UFC?

389
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,360
Yes.

390
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,118
Nah, too brutal for me.

391
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,191
You ever get into
street fights as a kid?

392
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,594
I did judo after school,
first grade.

393
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,176
Aw...
You should've seen me.

394
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,269
Judo?

395
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,794
'Cause with your frame
and your genetic makeup,

396
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,635
if you really
pushed your body,

397
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,433
and I mean really train,
you know?

398
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,316
No pussyfooting around.
You'd be a fucking beast.

399
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,798
Carrot cake!

400
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,313
Ooh!
Hi.

401
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Carrot cake.

402
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,555
What did I miss?

403
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,318
A whole bunch of nothing.

404
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,473
Just talking about sports.
Right?

405
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Yeah.

406
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That sounds good.

407
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,397
So the thing
about jiu-jitsu is

408
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,590
strength doesn't matter, right?
It's all about this.

409
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,035
It's a strategic game
like chess.

410
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,508
It's all about being two,
three, four moves ahead.

411
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
Cool.

412
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,439
Stand up.

413
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,875
Jeremy, no karate
at the dinner table.

414
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,160
It's not karate, Ma.

415
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,595
Yo, I got a rule.
No play-fighting with drunk dudes.

416
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
I don't play,
I'm just...

417
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,159
Jeremy.

418
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,077
I wasn't gonna hurt him.

419
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,036
He was gonna put you
in a fucking headlock.

420
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,788
What is his problem?

421
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,030
He has never treated
any of my boyfriends that way.

422
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,394
Ever, ever, ever.

423
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Mmm-hmm.

424
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,070
Oh, my God. And then my dad
with the "my man" stuff.

425
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,708
"My man, my man."

426
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,156
I don't think he's ever heard that
or said it. And now he just...

427
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,435
It's all he says.

428
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,595
Yup.

429
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,716
Oh, and my mom being
rude to Georgina?

430
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,075
What the fuck was that about?
That was so crazy.

431
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,874
I mean...

432
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,315
How are they different
than that cop?

433
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,000
That's the fucking
bummer of it all.

434
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Mmm-hmm.

435
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Mmm-hmm?

436
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,353
Anything more
you'd like to add?

437
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,117
I told you so, like...

438
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,793
I didn't want to say it.

439
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
I didn't want to say it.
I didn't want to say that.

440
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,072
I don't like being wrong.

441
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I've noticed that.

442
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
But I am sorry.

443
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,080
No, no, no.
Wait. Come here. Come here.

444
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,878
I'm sorry.
This sucks.

445
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,519
What? Why you saying "sorry"?

446
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,035
'Cause I brought you here and
I'm related to all of them.

447
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,753
No, it's fine.
It's fine.

448
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,753
Yeah?
Yeah?

449
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,836
Uh-huh.
How are you so calm?

450
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,996
Honestly, it's nothing.

451
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,030
I like you on your
racial flow, though.

452
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,992
Is this a racial flow?
Racial flow.

453
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,200
Am I feeling
a racial flow?

454
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,032
Yeah, you're
feeling racially flowy.

455
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,030
Oh, fuck. The party.

456
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,109
How bad can it be?

457
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,788
They are so white.
Like, so white!

458
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,995
It's all good.

459
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,275
Yeah?
Yeah.

460
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,271
You know,
with my genetic makeup,

461
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,317
shit gonna go down.

462
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,232
I'm a beast.
I'm a beast!

463
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,671
Do you realize how
dangerous smoking is?

464
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,915
Yeah.

465
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,069
Come in and sit with me.

466
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Please?

467
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,548
Just for a little while.
Please.

468
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Thank you.

469
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,238
So you're
comfortable enough, right?

470
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,668
It's perfect. Thanks.

471
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Sure.

472
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,872
You wanna know
how it works?

473
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,357
You just dangle a pocket watch in
front of people's faces? Is that it?

474
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,469
You watch a lot of TV.

475
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,511
When I was a kid.
Uh...

476
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,031
Now you're
feeling very sleepy.

477
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,274
We do use focal
points sometimes

478
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,594
to guide someone into a state
of heightened suggestibility.

479
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,398
"Heightened suggestibility."

480
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,437
That's right.
That's right.

481
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,640
Do you smoke in front
of my daughter?

482
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,314
I'm gonna quit.
I promise.

483
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,516
That's my kid.
That is my kid.

484
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
You understand?

485
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,269
What about your mother?

486
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,756
What about her?
Wait, are we...

487
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,952
Where were you when she died?

488
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,952
I don't want to
think about that.

489
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,313
Home. Watching TV.

490
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,392
Do you hear the TV?
What do you hear?

491
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Rain.

492
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,759
Rain. It was raining.

493
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Hmm.

494
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,155
You hear the rain?

495
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Mmm-hmm...

496
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,150
You hear it? Find it.

497
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,272
Tell me when you've found it.

498
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,672
Come here, Chris.
Look at me.

499
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
I found it.

500
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,193
Where was your mom?

501
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,874
She was coming home
and she wasn't home.

502
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
From work?

503
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Hmm.

504
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Hmm.

505
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,677
And what do you do?

506
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Nothing.

507
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Nothing.

508
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,713
I just sat there.

509
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,197
You didn't call anyone?
No.

510
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Why not?

511
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,832
I don't know.

512
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,837
I just thought that if I did,
it would make it real.

513
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Hmm.

514
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,388
You're so scared.

515
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,752
You think it was your fault.

516
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,593
How do you feel now?

517
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,068
I can't move.

518
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,713
You can't move.

519
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,108
Why can't I move?

520
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,319
You're paralyzed.

521
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,831
Just like that day
when you did nothing.

522
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,268
You did nothing.

523
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Now,

524
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,035
sink into the floor.

525
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,111
Wait, wait, wait.
Sink.

526
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,515
Now you're in
the Sunken Place.

527
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,599
'Sup, man?

528
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,350
They're workin' you
good out here, huh?

529
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,991
Nothing I don't want
to be doing.

530
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,155
Yeah.

531
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,392
I didn't get to meet you,
actually, up close. I'm Chris.

532
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,239
I know who you are.

533
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,078
She is lovely, isn't she?

534
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Rose?

535
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,468
Yeah, she is.

536
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,513
One of a kind.
Top of the line.

537
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,150
A real doggone keeper.

538
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,713
Right.

539
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,158
Sorry about last night.

540
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
What?

541
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,109
My exercise.

542
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,191
I didn't mean to scare you.

543
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,075
Yeah. Yeah.

544
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,073
And did it work?
Did what work?

545
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,510
You were in Mrs. Armitage's
office for quite some time.

546
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,869
Oh, yeah.

547
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Hmm?

548
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,477
I guess I had too much
of that wine last night.

549
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,160
Can't really remember. Sorry.

550
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,595
Well, I should get back to
work and mind my own business.

551
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,557
I think your mom hypnotized
me last night.

552
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,309
What?

553
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
When?

554
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,439
I went out for some air last night,
and I run into her.

555
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,951
And I can barely
remember anything,

556
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,440
but now the thought of a cigarette
makes me wanna throw up.

557
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Oh, my God.

558
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,393
I'm sorry. I can't believe
she did that to you.

559
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,471
And I had some
fucked-up dreams.

560
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,954
What'd you dream?

561
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,795
I was in a hole or something.
And I couldn't move. It was like...

562
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,871
Oh, God. That sounds terrible.

563
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,109
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,954
Hey, uh, what's Walter's deal?

565
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,113
What do you mean "his deal"?

566
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,869
I just talked to him.
Dude's whole vibe is hostile.

567
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,313
Did he say something?

568
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,189
It's not what he says.
It's how he says it, you know?

569
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Hmm.

570
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,312
Maybe he likes you.

571
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,039
Maybe he's jealous
or something. I don't...

572
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,919
Are you fucking with me?

573
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
No.

574
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,436
So you think I've got
a chance with him?

575
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,434
All right, you got jokes.
Put in a good word?

576
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,999
Great. No, funny.

577
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,515
I'm gonna talk to my dad about that.
That's not...

578
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,320
No, don't talk to your dad.
It's not cool.

579
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,296
It's fine, it's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal.

580
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,356
Forget about it. It's done.

581
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Okay.

582
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Oh, boy.

583
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,193
Oh, man.

584
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,474
It begins.

585
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,312
Are you ready for this?

586
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,708
Yeah, I am.

587
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
I'm not.

588
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,791
There they are.
Oh!

589
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,954
So nice.
How are you?

590
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,358
Just smile.
Smile? All right.

591
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,595
How do you do that again?

592
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,432
Yeah, just smile
the whole time.

593
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,278
Yeah, there you go.
There it is.

594
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,556
Oh, look,
it's the Greenes.

595
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,994
Gordon and Emily,
this is Chris.

596
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,718
Chris, this is Gordon
and Emily Greene.

597
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,949
Chris. Nice to meet you.

598
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,395
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Nice to meet you indeed.

599
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,595
Oh, that's quite a grip.

600
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,715
Thank you. You too, man.

601
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,432
You, uh, ever play golf?

602
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,029
Mmm, once, a few years ago.
I wasn't very good.

603
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,514
Gordon was a professional
golfer for years.

604
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,069
Oh, you kiddin'?

605
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,072
Well, I can't quite swing the
hips like I used to, though.

606
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,196
But, uh, I do know Tiger.

607
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Oh.

608
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,031
Oh, that's great.
Super.

609
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,828
Gordon loves Tiger.

610
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,319
Oh, the best I've ever seen.

611
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,192
Ever. Hands down.

612
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,874
So, Chris, uh,
let's see your form.

613
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,192
This is Nelson and Lisa.

614
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,594
Hey, how you doin'?

615
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,479
So, how handsome is he?

616
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,237
I don't know, are you handsome?

617
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
Okay.

618
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,590
Oh!
Not bad. Eh, Nelson?

619
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,750
So, is it true?

620
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Is it better?

621
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
Oh, wow.

622
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Wow.

623
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,959
Fairer skin has been in favor for the
past, what, couple of hundreds of years?

624
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,715
But now the pendulum
has swung back.

625
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,037
Black is in fashion.

626
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,435
Pardon me, I'm gonna
take some pictures.

627
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,794
Sure thing.

628
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,232
- There he is.
- Oh!

629
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,030
Good to see another
brother around here.

630
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,039
Hi. Yes, of course it is.

631
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,873
Something wrong?

632
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,994
There you are.

633
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,313
Do something with this.

634
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
Ah, yes, yes.

635
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,075
Oh, hello. I'm Philomena.
And you are?

636
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,551
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.

637
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,073
Fantastic.

638
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,708
You two make a lovely couple.

639
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,715
Thanks.

640
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,313
Oh, where are my manners?

641
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,710
Logan. Logan King.

642
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,033
Chris was just telling me
how he felt

643
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,076
much more comfortable
with my being here.

644
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,240
That's nice.

645
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,754
Logan, I hate to tear you
away, dear, but

646
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,592
the Wincotts were
asking about you.

647
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,079
Ah, mmm.

648
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,636
Well, it was nice to
meet you, Chris.

649
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,196
Goodbye.

650
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,996
What the fuck?

651
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,029
Ignorance.

652
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
Who?

653
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,479
All of 'em.

654
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,910
They mean well but they have no
idea what real people go through.

655
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,677
Jim Hudson.
Chris.

656
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,835
I know who you are.

657
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,755
I am an admirer of your work.
You have a great eye.

658
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,748
Wait, Jim Hudson?
Hudson Galleries?

659
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,838
Believe me, the irony of being a
blind art dealer isn't lost on me.

660
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,831
How'd you do it?

661
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,678
My assistant describes the
work to me in great detail.

662
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,999
You've got something.

663
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,233
The images you capture.
So brutal, so melancholic.

664
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,630
It's powerful stuff, I think.

665
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,794
Thank you.
Hmm.

666
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,274
Used to dabble myself,
wilderness mostly.

667
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,400
I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before
realizing I didn't have the eye.

668
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,195
I began dealing.
Then, of course, my vision went to shit.

669
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,520
Damn.

670
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,671
I know. Life can be
a sick joke.

671
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,835
One day, you're developing
prints in the darkroom.

672
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,514
The next day,
you wake up in the dark.

673
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,312
Genetic disease.

674
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,153
Shit ain't fair, man.

675
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,959
Oh, you got that right.
Shit ain't fair.

676
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Hey.

677
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,754
Come here, come here.

678
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,755
What the fuck?
You left me out there.

679
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,757
Look at this.

680
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,509
She unplugged my phone.

681
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,640
Who?

682
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,752
Georgina. I came here to talk
to Rod, and I got no juice.

683
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,956
So you think she
did that because...

684
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,874
Maybe she doesn't like

685
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,597
the fact that I'm with you.

686
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,314
Really?

687
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
It's a thing.

688
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,359
So you are so sexy that people
are just unpluggin' your phone?

689
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,720
Forget it. Never mind.

690
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,791
No, no, no. Stop, don't...

691
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,638
Don't do that.
Don't...

692
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,234
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's all good, all right?

693
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,072
They got you on
display now, huh?

694
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,549
It's weird, man.
And it's the people here, too.

695
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,216
It's like they haven't met a black
person that doesn't work for 'em.

696
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,673
Yep, you're in it.

697
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,114
Also, shit...

698
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,159
I don't even wanna tell you.

699
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,360
What?

700
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,512
I got hypnotized last night.

701
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,353
Nigga, get the fuck
outta here.

702
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,831
No. Yo, yo.
Yeah, to quit smoking.

703
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,355
But it's Rose's mom's
a psychiatrist, so...

704
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,193
Bruh, I don't care if the bitch
is Iyanla Vanzant, okay?

705
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,113
She can't fix my motherfuckin' life.
You ain't gettin' in my head.

706
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,192
I know. She caught me
off guard, right?

707
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,229
But it's cool because
I'm cured. It worked.

708
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,550
Bruh, how are you
not scared of this, man?

709
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,856
Look, they could've made you
do all types of stupid shit.

710
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,155
They'd have you fuckin'
barking like a dog,

711
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,240
flying around
like you're a fuckin' pigeon,

712
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,360
lookin' ridiculous, okay?

713
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,835
Or, I don't know
if you know this,

714
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,040
white people love makin'
people sex slaves and shit.

715
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,595
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're
not a kinky sex family, dawg.

716
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,275
Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the
shit outta niggas' heads. Okay?

717
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,317
But that was after
he fucked the heads.

718
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,118
Do you think they
saw that shit comin'?

719
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,429
Hell no.

720
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,352
Okay? They was comin'
over there like,

721
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,239
"I'mma just suck a little dick,
maybe jiggle some balls and shit."

722
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,231
No. They didn't get
a chance to jiggle shit

723
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,200
because their head
was off their fuckin' body.

724
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,216
Yeah, they still sucked a dick,
but without their heads.

725
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,037
It was fuckin' weird,
detached head shit.

726
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,800
You know, that's
Jeffrey Dahmer's business.

727
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,696
And thanks for that
image right there, man.

728
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,995
Hey, man, I ain't makin' this shit up.
I saw on A&E, man.

729
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,080
It's real life.

730
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,376
Yo, and it's the black people
out here, too.

731
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,277
It's like all of them
missed the movement.

732
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,277
'Cause they
probably hypnotized.

733
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,115
Look, bruh, all I'm doin'
is connecting the dots.

734
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,436
I'm taking what you
presented to me, okay?

735
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,511
I'mma tell you this.
I think that mom

736
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,856
is puttin' everybody
in a trance,

737
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,360
and she's fuckin'
the shit out of 'em.

738
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,628
Thanks, Rod, bye.

739
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,598
Hello.
Fuck. Hi.

740
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,955
I owe you an apology.

741
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,553
How rude of me to have touched
your belongings without asking.

742
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,755
Oh...

743
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,274
No, it's cool.
I was just confused.

744
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,911
Well, I can assure you,
there was no funny business.

745
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,630
Allow me to explain.

746
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,918
I lifted your cellular phone
to wipe down the dresser,

747
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,789
and it accidentally
came undone.

748
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,269
Yeah, I told... Rather than
meddle with it further,

749
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,352
I left it that way.

750
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,998
How foolish of me.

751
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,310
It's fine.
I wasn't trying to snitch.

752
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,040
Snitch?

753
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,154
Rat you out.

754
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,754
Tattletale.

755
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,120
Yeah.

756
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,471
Oh, don't you
worry about that.

757
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,358
I can assure you,

758
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,995
I don't answer to anyone.

759
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,989
Right.

760
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,557
All I know is sometimes

761
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,109
if there's too many white people,
I get nervous, you know?

762
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,435
Oh. Oh!

763
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,195
No. No. No.

764
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,390
No, no, no, no.

765
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,312
Aren't you something?

766
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,152
That's not my experience.

767
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,278
Not at all.

768
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,313
The Armitages are
so good to us.

769
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,071
They treat us like family.

770
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,919
This bitch is crazy.

771
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,073
The bitch is crazy.

772
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,433
Oh, hey, hang on. Chris.

773
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,751
Chris, I wanna introduce you
to some friends.

774
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,355
This is David
and Marcia Wincott,

775
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,192
Ronald and Celia Jeffries,

776
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,474
Hiroki Tanaka,

777
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,596
and Jessika and
Fredrich Walden.

778
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,750
Too many names
to remember, but hi.

779
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,479
Do you find that
being African-American

780
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:45,274
has more advantage or
disadvantage in the modern world?

781
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,560
Whoa!

782
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,953
It's a tough one.

783
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,956
Yeah, um, I don't know, man.

784
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,709
Hey.

785
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,872
Yo, my man.

786
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,096
They were askin' me about the
African-American experience.

787
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,473
Maybe you could take this one.

788
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,440
Oh.

789
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,949
Well, well, I find that the
African-American experience

790
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,470
for me has been,
for the most part, very good.

791
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,632
Although I find it difficult
to go into detail

792
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,918
as I haven't had much of a desire
to leave the house in a while.

793
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,993
We've become such homebodies.

794
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,673
Yes, yes.

795
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,031
But even when you go into the city,
I've just had no interest.

796
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,756
The chores have become
my sanctuary.

797
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,676
Fucking shit.

798
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
Get out.

799
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,672
Sorry, man.
Logan.

800
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,557
Get out!
Yo!

801
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,078
Yo, chill, man.
Get out!

802
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,336
Get outta here! Get outta here!
Chill! Chill, man! Chill!

803
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,952
Get the fuck outta here!
Chill!

804
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,472
Seizures create anxiety
which can trigger aggression.

805
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,148
Yeah, but randomly
attacking other people?

806
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,753
It's not random.

807
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,071
You know, it was your flash.
That's what set him off.

808
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,349
Hey.
Well...

809
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,630
How's he doing?
He's much better.

810
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,919
I imagine that I owe
you all an apology.

811
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,433
No, no, no.

812
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,239
We're just very happy
that you're yourself again.

813
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,913
Yes. Yes, I am.
Hmm.

814
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,833
And I thank God
for you for calming me down.

815
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,553
I know that I must've
frightened you all quite a bit.

816
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,308
Especially you, Chris.

817
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,152
No. I'm sorry.

818
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,235
The flash. I didn't know.

819
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,230
Of course not.
How could you have?

820
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,595
And you shouldn't
have been drinking, either.

821
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,154
Yes.

822
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,080
Well, I'll have to
let you all get on

823
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,429
the rest of the night without
the aid of my marvelous wit.

824
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,071
The whole ordeal has made me
quite a bit exhausted.

825
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,435
Logan, you just
get some rest.

826
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,431
It was nice
meeting you, Chris.

827
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,749
Yeah.

828
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,515
Something to lighten the mood?

829
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,956
Yes! Yeah, let's get this
party back on track.

830
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,953
How about sparklers
and Bingo?

831
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,592
We're gonna go on a walk.

832
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,269
You sure?

833
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,240
Shall we?

834
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,234
My cousin's epileptic.

835
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,878
That wasn't a seizure, right?

836
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,278
My dad's a neurosurgeon.

837
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,616
And that's what he said it was.
I'm inclined to trust...

838
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,790
That wasn't a seizure.
What was it then?

839
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,313
How long have you
known that guy?

840
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,118
I met him today. Why?

841
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,996
Man, this is gonna
sound weird,

842
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,557
but when he came at me,

843
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,352
it felt like I knew him.

844
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,991
Like you've met Logan before?

845
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,320
No, I don't know Logan.
I knew the guy that come at me.

846
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,158
I think your mom got in my head, all right?
I think she got in my head.

847
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,912
Yeah, and it worked,
I thought...

848
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,072
No, it did not.
It didn't work.

849
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,275
She got in my head,

850
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,440
and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up
shit that I don't want to think about.

851
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,678
Like what?

852
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,355
I just need to go.

853
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,879
You wanna go?
Mmm-hmm.

854
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,315
Without me?

855
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,720
Whatever you want.

856
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,713
I told you about that
night my mom died.

857
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,952
When I didn't call 911,
didn't go out looking for her.

858
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,560
Yeah.

859
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,632
One hour went by,
then two, then three,

860
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,392
and I just sat there.

861
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,630
I was just watching TV.

862
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,473
There's nothing
you could've done.

863
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,235
I found out later
that, uh,

864
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,629
she had survived
the initial hit.

865
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,950
She laid there bleeding
by the side of the road,

866
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,997
cold and alone.

867
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,317
That's how she died in the
early morning, cold and alone.

868
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,152
And I was watching TV.

869
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,436
There was time. There was time.
You were just a little kid.

870
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,833
There was time.

871
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,096
There was time, if somebody
was looking for her.

872
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,192
There was time, but nobody,
nobody was looking.

873
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,152
You're all I got.

874
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,710
I'm not gonna leave here without you.
I'm not gonna abandon you, okay?

875
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,112
You're not?

876
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,998
No, no, I'm not.

877
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,712
Oh, my God.

878
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,358
You scared me.

879
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,958
Let's go home.

880
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,519
What?

881
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,592
Let's go home. This sucks.

882
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,833
This sucks. Let's go home.

883
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,433
I'll make something up.

884
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,272
I love you.

885
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,912
I love you too, baby.

886
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,640
Good night.
Thank you.

887
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,074
Come on, sweetie.

888
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,514
Good night, Chris!
It was great to meet you.

889
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,348
Asshole.

890
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,160
Yo!

891
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,594
That's Dre.

892
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,795
Dre?

893
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,599
Andre Hayworth. He used
to kick it with Veronica.

894
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,680
Veronica from what?

895
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,274
Teresa's sister, that worked at
the movie theater on Eighth!

896
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,228
Yes, that is him!
That is him! But wait...

897
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,198
This is so fucking crazy!

898
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,191
Yo, he's different.

899
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,669
No shit. Why's he
dressed like that?

900
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,677
It's not that,
it's everything.

901
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,474
He came to the party with a white
woman 30 years older than him.

902
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,871
Sex slave! Oh, shit!

903
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,816
Chris, you gotta get the
fuck up outta there, man!

904
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,638
You in some Eyes Wide Shut situation.
Leave, motherfucker.

905
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,880
Hello?

906
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,469
You gonna be a...
Hello? Chris?

907
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,359
Oh, shit. His battery
must've fuckin' died.

908
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,992
Hey, handsome.
Are you packing?

909
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,275
Rose, we gotta go.

910
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,634
We gotta go now.

911
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,834
Okay.
Okay.

912
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,149
Is everything okay?

913
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,470
I'll tell you in the car.
But we gotta go right now.

914
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,158
Is that okay?
Okay, yeah.

915
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,551
Uh, let me go get my bag.
Okay.

916
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Okay.

917
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:07,960
Shit.

918
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,309
Hey, you ready?

919
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,073
Yeah, I'm just looking
for my camera.

920
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,160
Uh...

921
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,440
It's right here.

922
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,016
Have you got the keys? I'm gonna put
the bags in the trunk real quick.

923
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,040
Okay.

924
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,192
Uh, yeah.
They are in here somewhere.

925
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,157
It's just a matter of finding them.
Yeah.

926
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,240
You okay?

927
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,919
Yeah. Yeah.

928
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,115
Okay.

929
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,839
Might take me a second.

930
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,238
Hey, uh...

931
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,599
What, you can't
find those keys?

932
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,200
No. I can never find them.

933
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,355
Let's do this on the move.

934
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
Yeah.

935
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,396
Chris?
Just get the keys.

936
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,272
Yo.
Yo, man.

937
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,400
Where you going?
The party was just getting started.

938
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,112
Just putting the bags
in the car, man.

939
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,872
Would anyone like tea?

940
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,440
Nah, I'm good.
We leavin', actually.

941
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,875
Really? Why?
Is something wrong?

942
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,629
Rose?
His dog got really sick.

943
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,234
So he has to be at the vet
first thing in the morning.

944
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,880
Sick.
Yeah.

945
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,473
Oh, how terrible.

946
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,711
- Rose, the keys.
- Looking.

947
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,440
Rose?

948
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,069
What is your
purpose, Chris?

949
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,720
What?

950
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,078
In life, what is your purpose?

951
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,280
Right now,

952
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,752
it's finding those keys.

953
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,279
Fire.

954
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,275
It's a reflection
of our own mortality.

955
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,352
We're born, we breathe,
and we die.

956
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,440
Rose?

957
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,280
I'm looking.

958
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,438
Even the sun will die someday.

959
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,958
But we are divine.

960
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,795
We are the gods
trapped in cocoons.

961
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,313
Rose...

962
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,713
I don't know where they are.

963
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,880
Rose?

964
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,789
Rose!
Rose, give me those keys!

965
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,119
Rose, give me...

966
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,112
Give me those keys.
Rose, now! Now, the keys!

967
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,314
Be careful, bro.

968
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,629
What the fuck?

969
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,793
I didn't do anything.

970
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,394
What the fuck
is going on?

971
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,639
Where are those keys, Rose?

972
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,760
You know I can't give you
the keys, right, babe?

973
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,555
Come on.

974
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,838
Oh, shit.

975
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,514
Is he hurt?
Did you see him drop?

976
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,194
Yes, I did.
Jeremy, grab his legs, please.

977
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,078
Take him downstairs.
Dean, help him.

978
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,514
I can get him alone.

979
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,874
No, you can't.

980
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,176
You've already
damaged him enough.

981
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,519
Okay, fine.

982
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,800
Okay.

983
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,273
Ready?
Mind his head. Please.

984
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,549
Easy.

985
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,840
You're gonna drop him.

986
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,949
No, I'm not.

987
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,000
You're not gonna give me
a little credit?

988
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,874
Okay, that was my fault.

989
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,632
You were
one of my favorites.

990
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,631
You hear that, Chris?
Huh?

991
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,438
You're one of her favorites. Chris?

992
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,616
Hey, it's Chris.

993
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,916
I'm either away from the phone or I
just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.

994
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,240
Chris!

995
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,976
Hey, it's Chris.

996
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,117
I'm either away from the phone or I
just don't wanna talk to you. Peace.

997
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,955
Yeah.

998
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,960
Me too.

999
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,280
...College Fund.

1000
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,113
A mind is a terrible
thing to waste.

1001
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,636
Millions of Americans
feel the effects of aging.

1002
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,833
Oh, shit.

1003
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,233
Oh, shit!

1004
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:46,752
Is there anything
more beautiful than a sunrise?

1005
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,750
Hi. I'm Roman Armitage.

1006
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:57,118
And if you're watching this, you're
probably wondering what's going on.

1007
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,396
There's no need to worry.

1008
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,118
Let's take a walk.

1009
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:07,716
You have been chosen because
of the physical advantages

1010
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,388
you've enjoyed
your entire lifetime.

1011
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,916
With your natural gifts
and our determination,

1012
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,833
we could both be
part of something greater.

1013
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,911
Something perfect.

1014
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:27,837
The Coagula procedure
is a man-made miracle.

1015
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,953
Our order has been developing
it for many, many years,

1016
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,351
and it wasn't until
recently it was perfected

1017
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,313
by my own flesh and blood.

1018
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:48,793
My family and I are honored to offer it
as a service to members of our group.

1019
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,468
Don't waste your strength,
don't try to fight it.

1020
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,633
You can't stop the inevitable.
And who knows?

1021
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:02,436
Maybe one day, you'll enjoy
being members of the family.

1022
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,312
Behold,

1023
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,559
the Coagula.

1024
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,193
What the fuck?

1025
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,952
Hello, Mr...

1026
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,470
Uh, Williams. Rod Williams.

1027
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,955
From the TSA?

1028
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,189
Yes, ma'am.

1029
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,357
You know all TSA issues should be brought
up with your authorizing officer.

1030
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,510
Yes, ma'am, but this
is not TSA business.

1031
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,036
Okay, don't call me "ma'am."
Otherwise we're not gonna get along.

1032
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,160
How can I help you,
Rod Williams from the TSA?

1033
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,798
All right, here it is.
Mmm.

1034
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,396
My boy, Chris, has been
missing for two days.

1035
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,309
Your son is missing?

1036
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,154
Oh, no. Not my son,
my friend. He's 26.

1037
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,231
His name is Chris Washington.

1038
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,036
He left on Friday with
his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

1039
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,080
She's white.

1040
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,955
All right. Go on.

1041
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,280
Look, Chris was supposed
to come back on Sunday, right?

1042
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,908
And I've been watching his dog, Sid.

1043
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,040
That's Sid.

1044
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,473
Cute, right?

1045
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,590
So Chris sent this to me from his
girlfriend's parents' house.

1046
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,638
See, that's Andre Hayworth.

1047
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,756
Okay? Somebody we knew
from back in the day.

1048
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,310
Apparently, he's been missing for
six months in some affluent suburb.

1049
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,351
Well, he don't look
so missing to me.

1050
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,510
That's 'cause we
found him, right?

1051
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,240
But Chris said
he's acting real different.

1052
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,709
Different how?

1053
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,920
This dude is from Brooklyn.

1054
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,078
Huh? He didn't dress
like this.

1055
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,112
I didn't use to
dress like this.

1056
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,755
Plus he's married to a
white woman twice his age.

1057
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,156
And that would explain
the clothes. All right.

1058
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,078
Oh, Lord! Rod Williams
from the TSA.

1059
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,160
I know, I know, I know.

1060
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,117
Okay, I'm trying to
work towards this.

1061
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,990
Look, what I'm about to
tell you gonna sound crazy.

1062
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,959
You ready?
All right.

1063
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,155
Try me.

1064
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,313
I believe they've been
abducting black people,

1065
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:31,109
brainwashing 'em, making 'em work
for 'em as sex slaves and shit.

1066
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,720
Oh, sorry about the "shit."

1067
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,520
Sorry.

1068
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,480
Hold on a second.

1069
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,296
Then he sent me some
weird picture and I'm like,

1070
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,753
"Oh, man,
that's Andre Hayworth."

1071
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,296
This dude been missing
for six months, right?

1072
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,640
So I do all my research,
you know, 'cause as a TSA agent...

1073
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,075
You guys are detectives?
I got the same training, you know?

1074
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,752
We might know more
than y'all sometimes.

1075
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,816
'Cause we dealin' with
some terrorist shit, so...

1076
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,136
But that's a
totally different story.

1077
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,754
So, look, I go do
my detective work, right?

1078
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,876
And I start putting
pieces together.

1079
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,440
And, see, this is
what I came up with.

1080
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:08,116
They're probably abducting black people,
brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.

1081
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,750
Or sex slaves. Not just regular slaves,
but sex slaves and shit.

1082
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:17,040
See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis
that's making 'em slaves or whatnot,

1083
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,711
but all I know is they already
got two brothers we know,

1084
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,400
and there could be a whole bunch
of brothers they got already.

1085
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,360
What's the next move?

1086
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,956
And don't ever, ever say that
I don't do nothin' for you.

1087
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,312
Oh! White girls.
Oh, they get you every time.

1088
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,400
Oh!

1089
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,360
Magic ain't real.

1090
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,031
None of this shit makes sense.

1091
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Hello?

1092
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,640
Chris?

1093
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,069
Yo, um...

1094
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:21,153
Hey, what up?
Rose, it's me, Rod.

1095
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,360
Hi.

1096
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,955
Where's Chris?

1097
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,675
He left two days ago.

1098
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,909
He left?

1099
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,399
Yeah. He got all paranoid,
and then he freaked out on me.

1100
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,951
And then he just got
in a cab and left his phone.

1101
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,909
Wait. You haven't seen him?

1102
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,832
No, he never came back here.

1103
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,838
Oh, my God.

1104
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,791
Look, look, I've been calling
his phone a bunch of times.

1105
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,393
Matter of fact,
I went to the police.

1106
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,039
What did you say?

1107
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,799
I just said he was missing.

1108
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,075
Oh, good. Uh...

1109
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,074
Let me ask you somethin'.

1110
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,029
What cab company
did he, uh, use to leave?

1111
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,314
Oh, gosh.

1112
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,676
I don't know. I guess
maybe a local one.

1113
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,558
Or I guess he could've
called an Uber?

1114
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,634
Um, wait. I'm so confused.

1115
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,717
Oh, you confused? Okay.

1116
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,079
You know somethin'? Me too.

1117
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,719
Could you hold on one second?
Okay.

1118
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,114
Okay. Hold on.

1119
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,158
You lyin' bitch. She is lyin' like
a motherfucker. I know that...

1120
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,671
Ooh, that TSA shit tingles.
This motherfucker's lying.

1121
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,510
Okay, I got you.
I'm gonna record your ass.

1122
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,918
I'mma record
the shit outta you.

1123
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,673
You talk too goddamn much.
You're gonna say somethin'.

1124
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,432
Hold on. Record.

1125
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,749
Speaker.

1126
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,589
Unmute.

1127
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,360
Uh, Rose?

1128
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,033
Uh-huh?
Um...

1129
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,037
So last time I talked to Chris,
he told me your mama hypnotized him.

1130
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,272
Rod, just stop.

1131
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Huh?

1132
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,679
I know why you're calling.

1133
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,355
Why is that?

1134
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,910
It's kind of obvious,
don't you think?

1135
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:14,880
What?

1136
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,917
That there's something
between us.

1137
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,720
No. What you talkin' about, girl?
I called you about Chris.

1138
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,516
No, Rod, whenever we'd go out,
I remember you looking at me.

1139
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,750
What the fuck you...
No! Chris is my best friend.

1140
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,096
Look, if you did
somethin' to him...

1141
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,509
I know you think about
fucking me, Rod.

1142
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,216
Ain't nobody thought about fucking you.
Why would you say some stupid shit?

1143
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,834
What the... You ass! Fuck you!
I didn't wanna...

1144
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,319
Fuck you! Bye!

1145
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,429
Shit!

1146
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:43,074
God! She's so...
She's a fuckin'... She's a...

1147
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,400
She's a genius.

1148
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,273
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1149
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,749
Hey, Chris.

1150
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,593
How's it going, buddy?

1151
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,073
You can answer.
There's an intercom in the room.

1152
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,512
Where's Rose?

1153
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,278
Oh, you dirty dog.

1154
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,554
You're one of the lucky ones,
trust me.

1155
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:46,315
Jeremy's wrangling method
sounds way less pleasant.

1156
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,070
I'm supposed to answer
any outstanding questions,

1157
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,708
concerns you may have so far.

1158
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,998
Apparently, our common
understanding of the process

1159
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,157
has a positive impact on the
success rate of the procedure.

1160
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,875
You could give a shit,
right? Okay.

1161
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,914
Let me just tell you
what it is.

1162
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,355
Phase one was the hypnotism.

1163
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,271
That's how they sedate you.

1164
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,396
Phase two is this.

1165
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:22,189
Mental preparation.
It's basically psychological pre-op.

1166
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,709
Pre-op?

1167
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,353
For phase three.

1168
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,637
The transplantation.

1169
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,317
Well, partial, actually.

1170
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,598
The piece of your brain connected
to your nervous system

1171
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:44,356
needs to stay put, keeping those
intricate connections intact.

1172
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,958
So you won't be gone,
not completely.

1173
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:52,238
A sliver of you will still be in there,
somewhere, limited consciousness.

1174
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,275
You'll be able to see and hear

1175
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,274
what your body is doing,

1176
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,590
but your existence
will be as a passenger.

1177
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,875
An audience. You'll live in...

1178
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,712
The Sunken Place.

1179
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,236
Now you're in the Sunken Place.

1180
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,394
Yeah. That's what
she calls it.

1181
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,070
Now, I'll control the motor
functions, so I'll be...

1182
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,160
Me.

1183
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,599
You'll be me.

1184
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,392
Good, good.

1185
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,070
You got it quick. Good on you.

1186
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,233
Why us, huh?

1187
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,832
Why black people?

1188
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,593
Who knows?

1189
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,717
People want a change.
Some people wanna be stronger,

1190
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,753
faster, cooler.

1191
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,751
Black is in fashion.

1192
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:06,752
But please don't lump me in with that.
I could give a shit what color you are.

1193
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:11,152
No. What I want is deeper.

1194
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,635
I want your eye, man.

1195
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,239
I want those things
you see through.

1196
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,158
This is crazy.

1197
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,108
Okay, I'm done.

1198
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,832
No, no, no, no.

1199
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,718
Jeremy?

1200
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,309
You fuck!

1201
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
You fuck.

1202
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,635
Fuck you!

1203
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,470
Come on! Come on!

1204
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,149
One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

1205
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,111
Three Mississippi.
Four Mississippi.

1206
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,376
911. What's your emergency?

1207
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:24,278
I'm at the Armitage house.
My name is Chris.

1208
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,118
I'm sorry, sir,
can you repeat that?

1209
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,560
I'm at the Armitage...

1210
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,830
No, no, no.
Don't do it, don't do it.

1211
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,230
Don't do it. Just fuckin' go.

1212
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,354
Grandma.

1213
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:30,150
You ruined my house!

1214
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,553
Get him, Grandpa.

1215
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,594
Damn you!

1216
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,519
Let me do it.

1217
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,870
Chris, I'm so sorry.

1218
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,828
It's me.

1219
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,639
And I love you.

1220
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,319
I love you.

1221
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,319
I love you.

1222
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,395
Help. Help.

1223
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,756
Help. Help me.

1224
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,995
Oh, shit!

1225
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:29,920
Chris!

1226
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:09,479
I mean, I told you
not to go in that house.

1227
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,799
I mean...

1228
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,032
How'd you find me?

1229
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,997
I'm T-S-motherfuckin'-A.

1230
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,798
We handle shit.

1231
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,078
That's what we do.

1232
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,070
Consider this situation
fuckin' handled.
