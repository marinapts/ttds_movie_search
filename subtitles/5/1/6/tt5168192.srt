1
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,251
Good morning, Mr Blake. My name's Amanda.

2
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,499
I've got a couple of questions
here for you today

3
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:43,134
to establish your eligibility for
Employment Support Allowance.

4
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,461
It won't take up much of your time.

5
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,296
Could I just ask firstly,

6
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:52,005
can you walk more than 50 metres
unassisted by any other person?

7
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,853
- Yes.
- Okay.

8
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:58,015
Can you raise either arm as if to
put something in your top pocket?

9
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,940
I've filled this in already
on your 52-page form.

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,560
Yeah, I can see that you have

11
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:06,029
but, unfortunately,
I couldn't make out what you had said there.

12
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:08,532
Yes.

13
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:14,954
Can you raise either arm to the top of
your head as if you are putting on a hat?

14
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,334
I've telt you, there's nowt wrong
with me arms and legs.

15
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:19,374
Could you just answer
the question, please.

16
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,747
Well, you've got me medical records.

17
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,464
Can we just talk about me heart?

18
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,459
D'you think you could
just answer these questions?

19
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:27,047
Okay.

20
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,428
So was that a yes, that you
can put a hat on your head?

21
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,260
- Yes.
- Okay, that's great.

22
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,982
Can you press a button
such as a telephone keypad?

23
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,638
There's nowt wrong with me fingers either.

24
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,190
I mean, we're getting farther
and farther away from me heart.

25
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:47,114
If we could just keep
to these questions, thank you.

26
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,404
Do you have any significant difficulty

27
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,067
conveying a simple message to strangers?

28
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:56,077
Yes. Yes, it's me fucking heart.
I'm trying to tell you but you'll not listen.

29
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:59,873
Mr Blake, if you continue
to speak to us like that

30
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:02,786
that's not gonna be very helpful
for your assessment.

31
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,416
If you could just answer
the question, please.

32
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:07,214
- Yes.
- Okay.

33
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:17,104
Do you ever experience any loss of control
leading to extensive evacuation of the bowel?

34
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,018
No. But I cannot guarantee

35
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,178
there won't be a first if we divvent
get to the point.

36
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:26,109
Can you complete a simple
task of setting an alarm clock?

37
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,399
Oh, Jesus. Yes.

38
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:32,318
Can I ask you a question?
Are you medically qualified?

39
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:34,861
I'm a health care professional

40
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,409
appointed by the
Department of Work and Pensions

41
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:41,124
to carry out assessments for
Employment and Support Allowance.

42
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,331
But there was a bloke out in the,
er, in the waiting room,

43
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,667
he says that you work
for an American company.

44
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,343
Our company's been
appointed by the Government.

45
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,554
Are you a nurse? Are you a doctor?

46
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,423
I'm a health care professional.

47
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:58,014
Listen, I've had a major heart attack.

48
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,967
I nearly fell off the scaffolding.

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,770
I wanna get back to work, too.

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,900
Now, please, can we talk about me heart?

51
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,610
Forget about me arse, that works a dream.

52
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:48,515
Piper, you lazy bastard.

53
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,686
Will you get out of bed
and do some housework!

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,940
China!

55
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,192
China!

56
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:57,116
Sorry, Dan, just got a text
to go to work. I'm late.

57
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,316
Did you enjoy your chicken tikka masala?

58
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,409
- How did you know that?
- Cos I can bloody smell it.

59
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:04,204
How many times have I told you about
leaving rubbish lying about the place,

60
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:05,367
stinking it up?

61
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,116
- Can I dump it later? I'm running late.
- No. Now!

62
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,047
Dan...

63
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,462
Erm, I've got a big favour to ask

64
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,508
I'm expecting a package. Really important.

65
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,512
They've changed my hours, so I won't be in.

66
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:21,136
Can you keep an eye out for the postman?

67
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:24,433
If you swear nae more rubbish.

68
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:28,559
- Catch!
- Don't you fucking dare.

69
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,225
- I'll kick your arse into next week.
- Okay.

70
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,225
Daft as a bloody brush.

71
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,424
When can I go back to work?

72
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,671
Ah, not yet, that's for certain.

73
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,301
You're making progress.

74
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:02,849
I think if we just
continue you on the same dosage.

75
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,262
And, yeah, rehab exercise.

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,187
We'll see if we can
the pumping capacity to increase.

77
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,687
- Yeah.
- And it might.

78
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,690
But if not, we might need to look
at fitting you with a defibrillator.

79
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:19,074
Keep up with the exercise, keep moving.
That's gonna build you up.

80
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,908
But you need to be rested as well.

81
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,030
Well, I'm a bit of a night owl, you know.

82
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,204
I got into the habit
when I was looking after the missus

83
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,664
before she passed away.

84
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,995
How you doing, son? How you doing?

85
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,094
- All right.
- How's the old ticker?

86
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,843
Ah, you know, me marathon days are over.

87
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,085
But, you know,
I'll be fine in a month or two.

88
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,217
Ah, well, be leaving that Viagra alone.

89
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,223
I'll keep it for you, shall I?

90
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,813
Aye, I probably need it more than you.

91
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,774
Right, well, owt you want here?

92
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,983
- Have a look
- Oh, that's nice, aye.

93
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,323
Meranti, aye, African Meranti.
It's great, man.

94
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,121
So, er, d'you reckon
you'll get back to Ferguson's?

95
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:06,276
Depends on the work, I suppose.

96
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,447
I mean, you know what it's like.
It's up and down.

97
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:09,618
Aye, well.

98
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,999
Gotta see this.

99
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:20,917
There you go.

100
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,009
Oh, that's a lovely piece.

101
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,392
Aye, I'll have the...
I'll have the lads drop it by for you.

102
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,428
Erm, are you all right?

103
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:32,524
I'm on the mend.

104
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,145
I mean, I can get your shopping
sorted out for you, you know.

105
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,272
Like, the heavy stuff and that,
like, it's nae bother.

106
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,067
Thanks, Joe.
You know, I like to get out and about.

107
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,364
Gives us something to do.

108
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,856
Well, give us a shout if you need anything.

109
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,779
I mean, I mean that.

110
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,366
You, you gave us a big fright, you know.

111
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,850

I knew it was you bringing your dog
in here, shitting all over the place.

128
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,896
Oh shut your mouth,

00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,002
Shut up.

137
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,554
Hello?

140
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,997
Morning, mate.
Got a package for Mr Max Million.

141
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,750
- "Mr Max Million"?
- Yeah. Mr Max Million.

142
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,084
My address?

143
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,844
Yeah, definitely this address.

144
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,633
- Where's it from?
- China.

145
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,674
Oh. Give it here.

146
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,515
D'you know how long
I've been on this phone?

147
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,175
One hour, forty-eight minutes.

148
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:41,426
Jesus Christ, that's longer than
a football match. It'll cost a fortune.

149
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,098
I'm sorry, sir, but it's been very busy.

150
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:45,597
There must be some mistake.

151
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,518
I've got a serious heart condition.

152
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:50,226
I'm in rehab and the doctor's
told us I cannae go back to work.

153
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,696
Now, I was getting the benefits
fine until that bloody assessment.

154
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,072
I see you've only
scored twelve points, er,

155
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,909
and you need 15 to obtain benefits.

156
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,115
Oh, points, that's your game?

157
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,959
I'm sorry, sir,
but according to our health, er,

158
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,544
health care professional,

159
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,084
you've been deemed fit for work.

160
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,050
So she knows better than my doctor,

161
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,841
a consultant surgeon and a physio team?

162
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,632
Well, I wanna appeal.

163
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:19,256
Well, that's fine, but you'll have to first
request a mandatory reconsideration.

164
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,934
What the bloody hell does that mean?

165
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,636
It means the decision
maker will reconsider it

166
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,687
and if he comes to the same
decision, you can then appeal.

167
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,904
Right, well put us down for that, then.

168
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,904
Okay, sir, but you must wait

169
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,646
to get a call from the decision maker.

170
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,318
Why?

171
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,025
To tell you what the decision is.

172
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,527
But that's already been decided.

173
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,945
It is, but you're supposed to get the call,

174
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,540
before the letter.

175
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,334
Well, is he gonna change his mind?

176
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,916
No, the call's just to discuss the decision.

177
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,798
Well, I know what the decision is,
I've got the letter here in front of us.

178
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,673
D'you want us to read it to you?

179
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,800
But he should have called you first.

180
00:11:57,927 --> 00:11:59,217
But he didn't.

181
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,175
But he should have.

182
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,595
Well unless we've got a time machine,
we're pretty much knackered,

183
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,062
divvent you agree?

184
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,636
Er, he has to call you first, sir.

185
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,347
Listen,

186
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,685
can you not just put him on now,
so I don't have to waste any more time?

187
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,685
I can't do that, sir.

188
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,489
Where is he?

189
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,405
He'll give you a call back when he, er,

190
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,701
- he gets the chance.
- When?

191
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,989
I don't know, sir.

192
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,122
This is ridiculous, man.

193
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:47,481
On the one hand, Jobseeker's Allowance,

194
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,481
only for those able and ready to work.

195
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:53,073
But if you're ill, you have to apply
for Employment and Support,

196
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,940
get an assessment carried out.

197
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,453
Well, I've done that
but they've knocked us back.

198
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,486
Right, well if you've been
deemed fit for work,

199
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,743
your only option is Jobseeker's Allowance.

200
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,834
Or proceed with the appeal on
Employment and Support.

201
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,248
Well, can you give me a form for...

202
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,790
You know, erm, Jobseeker's Allowance

203
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,333
and then an appeal form
Employment and Support?

204
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,828
You have to apply online, sir.

205
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,039
I cannot do that.

206
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,506
Well that's how it is, sir.
Or you can phone the helpline.

207
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,677
Listen, you know,
you give me a plot of land,

208
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,087
I can build you a house.

209
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,681
But I've never been
anywhere near a computer.

210
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,683
D'you know what, we're digital by default.

211
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,063
Oh, here we gan.

212
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:28,687
I hear this all the time on the phone,
"I'm digital by default."

213
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,597
Well I'm pencil by default.

214
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,479
Look, I mean, what happens
if you just cannae do it?

215
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,942
There's a special number
if you've been diagnosed as dyslexic.

216
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,654
Right, well can you give us that?
Cos with computers I'm dyslexic.

217
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,779
You'll find it online, sir.
I must ask you to leave now,

218
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,486
if you've got no appointment.

219
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:52,246
Right, can I help you?

220
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,504
Yeah, I'm here to see about
changing my work coach.

221
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,957
Thomas Armstrong, please.

222
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,801
Hang on a minute, Thomas, hang on.

223
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,300
Erm, would you like to take a seat?

224
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,889
Oh, I just need a minute. I just felt...
I'm just feeling dizzy, you know.

225
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,806
- Come and sit down.
- Oh, cheers, thanks.

226
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,305
Could you move up, please, love?

227
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,068
Thanks, pet, thank you.

228
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,610
- All right. I'll just get you a glass of water.
- Thank you.

229
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,700
Oh, thank you, pet. Thank you.

230
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,619
Are you all right? You look a bit pale.

231
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,831
It's just so bloody confusing,
all the jargon.

232
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,423
I mean, there must be some mistake.
I'm just ganning round and round in circles.

233
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,217
I've, I've really gotta
get this sorted out.

234
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh I can understand that,
but you were late.

235
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:46,511
Thomas. You sit here
and drink your water, pet.

236
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,847
Thank you.

237
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,234
So now you're gonna sanction me so, er...

238
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,772
- No, I'm not gonna sanction you.
- I may not get any money for a month.

239
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,312
I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker
and they'll make the decision

240
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,318
- on whether they're gonna sanction you.
- That's ridiculous...

241
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm not actually making the decision,
they're gonna do that.

242
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,648
And then if they do decide
to sanction you,

243
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:03,782
then you will take a 40%
cut in your benefits.

244
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,912
I know what it is,
I don't need you to explain it to me.

245
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,741
- I'm more than aware...
- Well there isn't anything else

246
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,787
anybody can do today.

247
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,367
So what I'm gonna have to do is,
look, I think I'm...

248
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,164
I've decided to...
Are you gonna put me in for a sanction?

249
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,328
I have to, I have to follow the rules.

250
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,915
And the thing is if you're gonna,
be aggressive with me

251
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,590
- then I'm gonna have to ask you...
- It's not about me being aggressive.

252
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,460
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- I'm trying to explain to you a situation

253
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:21,628
and you don't care.

254
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,585
- Er, security. Security?
- I don't know why people like you do this job.

255
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:25,804
I'm referring you to the decision maker.

256
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,804
It's all the same thing.
I don't wanna hear your language

257
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,677
- I, I beg your pardon.
- Listen, I, I'm sorry, love,

258
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,426
- but you're gonna have to leave.
- Yeah, all right, frankly,

259
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:34,018
take your hands off me.
I'm gonna speak to the manager,

260
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,693
- I don't wanna speak to you.
- The fact is I'm just trying to explain...

261
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:37,900
- Sorry?
- I'm just explaining...

262
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,020
Well it's not you I wanna speak to...

263
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,898
- You can go back up there.
- Right, come and talk to me then

264
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,533
- if you've got something to say.
- Okay. Sorry.

265
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:43,822
All right.

266
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,452
I've tried to explain to the woman,
I've never been to Newcastle before.

267
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:47,826
We've just moved up here from London.

268
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,946
I've been here a few days,
I don't know where I'm going. Okay?

269
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,830
I was on the bus, it's gone the wrong way.

270
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,500
We've run, got off the bus,
run so that I wasn't any more late.

271
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:58,212
She just don't wanna know and now she's telling
me she's gonna refer me for a sanction.

272
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,170
What I want you to do is listen to me. Okay?

273
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,835
The lady's told you what's right.

274
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,381
There's rules here,
rules that we have to stick to. Okay?

275
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,927
- It isn't against you, but you have a duty.
- Oh, mate, listen,

276
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,849
- I'm not saying it's against me.
- You have a duty to be here on time.

277
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,390
And I'm explaining to you
why I wasn't here on time.

278
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,885
- D'you know what? I understand, right...
- I got lost.

279
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,186
But what I gather now
is the decision maker...

280
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,812
The decision maker's gonna be
sending you a letter through the post.

281
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:21,860
So you're gonna have to wait for that.

282
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
- And then nobody...
- Yeah, I've got... My kids

283
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,645
have gotta start school tomorrow.
I've got about 12 quid in my purse.

284
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:27,858
- D'you know what?
- All because you can't just calm down

285
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:28,867
- and listen to people when they talk.
- Right.

286
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:29,987
- You have to do this.
- Right, d'you know what,

287
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,195
- I've listened to you. You've created a scene.
- With your rules.

288
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,406
- I think you need to...
- I've created a scene?

289
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,615
- You need to leave the building.
- If I was gonna create a scene,

290
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:36,746
you'd know about it, trust me.

291
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:37,876
I'm sorry, love,
but you are gonna have to go.

292
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:38,956
This is ridiculous.

293
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,421
- Jesus Christ!
- What am I supposed to do?

294
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,962
- Who's first in this queue?
- I am.

295
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,669
D'you mind if this young lass signs on first?

296
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:46,757
- No, no, you carry on.
- There you go.

297
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,512
Now you can go back to your
desk and let her sign on

298
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,885
and do the job that the taxpayer
pays you for.

299
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,470
- This is a bloody disgrace.
- Listen, all right,

300
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,894
this doesn't have to involve you.

301
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:59,234
Everybody's trying to do their job here
and you're creating more of a scene again.

302
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,563
But, look, you're not listening to her.

303
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,228
She's out of the area.
She's just been a few minutes...

304
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,897
Can you not let her sign on?
She's got two kids with her, man.

305
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,864
- What's wrong with you people?
- Right, listen, this isn't your concern.

306
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,357
I want you to get out as well. All right?

307
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:12,779
I need you to leave.
We need to do this right. Yeah.

308
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,368
- All right.
- Listen, listen, listen...

309
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,993
- They're just gonna call the police.
- Phone the police.

310
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,658
Can we get some perspective in here?

311
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,538
You need to go or we're gonna
phone the police. All right?

312
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:20,865
Come on. Thanks very much...

313
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,539
Can we have a bit of perspective,
please, here, man?

314
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,038
- Away, don't be silly.
- Shouldn't even have this job.

315
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,379
- Come on. Please.
- Shouldn't even have this job.

316
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,134
- Come on, get out.
- All she needs is help, man.

317
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,796
- Let's get going.
- Just let her sign on.

318
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,264
Let's get going, all right.

319
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,682
Please.

320
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,887
I don't know what's wrong
with you lot, I really don't.

321
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,892
I need you to keep going for me, okay?

322
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:44,023
- You want me to take one of them bags?
- No, it's all right, I'm fine, pet. I'm fine.

323
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,025
- Where's Dylan?
- I don't know.

324
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,614
Dylan! Come on!

325
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,697
- Honestly. Honestly.
- He's a handful, isn't he?

326
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,204
I can't sit down for five minutes
without him getting in trouble, can I?

327
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,446
Right.

328
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,708
- Good, good choice.
- She loves spaghetti.

329
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,292
Hey, you cannae go wrong
with spaghetti on toast.

330
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,587
Spaghetti, spaghetti on toast, isn't it?

331
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:06,961
Where's your brother gone?

332
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,795
- Dylan!
- Dylan!

333
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,512
Come on.

334
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,592
This, this is what he does.
He runs, he runs off.

335
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,048
- He's a handful, in't he?
- Come on!

336
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,723
Where ye been, on an adventure?

337
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,980
Dylan, not on the fences.

338
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,770
- It's just here.
- Mum, look, she's back, she's back.

339
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,229
She's back.

340
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:38,077
Tell you what, if it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna make this place a home.

341
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,078
You don't know how to fix a cistern, do you?

342
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,751
It's driving me insane.

343
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,326
- Yeah, I'll have a look at that.
- Yeah?

344
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,080
I can fix owt, me, pet,

345
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,091
apart from computers.

346
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,670
- Straight up. You show him...
- I'll show him.

347
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,142
Dylan, can you stop it? Get in.

348
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,816
Hello, Mum. How are you doing?

349
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:11,993
Yeah.

350
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,320
Yeah, all right. All right. Yeah.

351
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,122
It's nice, it's nice.
There's plenty of space.

352
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:23,075
And, erm, yeah, it looks like they've put...
There's a nice bit of fresh carpet down.

353
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,833
The, the walls are all
nicely painted and that.

354
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:31,707
No, I know, Mum. Well, look, once...
Once you're feeling better and we're settled,

355
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,969
then you'll have to come up. You can come up
with Auntie May and stay, can't you?

356
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,138
Yeah, they're nice, yeah, friendly.
Friendlier than London.

357
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,308
Yeah.

358
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,430
D'you wanna have a word with Daisy?

359
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,444
All right, hold on. Talk to Nana.

360
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,069
Hello, Nan.

361
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,399
- Hello, Daisy. How are you?
- Good.

362
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,164
- Yeah? D'you like it?
- Yeah.

363
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,366
- Are you happy?
- Yeah, very.

364
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,408
I miss you, too. Bye.

365
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,157
Bye-bye.

366
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,174
Hello, Mum.

367
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,301
All right. That's all right.
All right, I'll speak... Yeah, I've gotta go

368
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,050
but I'll speak, I'll call you tomorrow.

369
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,843
- All right.
- All right, love you.

370
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,545
- Love you, too. Bye.
- Bye, bye, bye.

371
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,473
So what are you doing up here, Katie?

372
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,558
It started when we got
kicked out of the flat.

373
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:25,983
We got in a bit of trouble.

374
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,189
It was ridiculous.

375
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,859
In Dylan's room there was a leak
coming through the wall,

376
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,650
coming through the top of the ceiling
down the wall.

377
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,734
And it was making him really sick.
Weren't it, Dais?

378
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,189
- Remember when Dylan weren't well?
- Yeah.

379
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,574
We had to run all the way to the hospital.

380
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,196
Yeah, he was in and out the hospital.

381
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,119
I was talking to the landlord about it,
spoke to him.

382
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,199
And cos I complained, kicked us out.

383
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,448
What, they can just do that?

384
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,118
- Just throw you out?
- Yeah, yeah.

385
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,002
So we got out of there.

386
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,877
We was in a homeless hostel
for about two years, waiting on a flat.

387
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:56,877
Yeah. But it was close to their school
which they loved, so...

388
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,891
We just had to stick it out.
But we was in one room,

389
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,140
the three of us were in one room.

390
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,270
Like eating, sleeping, all the rest of it
and Dylan was just climbing the walls.

391
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,100
Honestly,
like boxed in like that, so, yeah.

392
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,768
They eventually offered me a flat,
so the good news was it was a flat.

393
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,529
Bad news was it was up here.

394
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,861
And they couldn't give you
anywhere near your family?

395
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,157
No, not in London.

396
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:23,237
They're, they're moving out the likes of me.
It's just too expensive for 'em.

397
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,246
So how's the kids taking it?

398
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,250
They're brokenhearted about leaving school.

399
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,827
Especially Daisy. She's furious with me.

400
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,342
Having to leave her friends and her nan.

401
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,922
I mean there was nothing I could do about it.
I couldn't have Dylan boxed in like that.

402
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,969
- Ah, she'll make friends soon enough.
- That's what I've told her.

403
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,641
And I've got a plan.

404
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,603
We got a little garden now and they've
each got a room of their own.

405
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,444
I'm gonna get a part-time job
and then I'm gonna go back to me books.

406
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,306
- Oh, you at college?
- Open University.

407
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:57,276
Yeah, I mucked up a little bit at school
so it's like a second chance.

408
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,817
But that all fell apart a little bit when
we was at the hostel,

409
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:02,105
but I'm not gonna give up.

410
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,906
Can't, can I?

411
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,529
Good on you, lass.

412
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,203
It's bloody freezing in here.

413
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,956
Oh, it must be a short.

414
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,883
Right, where's your fuse box?

415
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,593
There's nothing on the metre.

416
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,757
The kids are starting school and
I wanted to get 'em some nice new clothes.

417
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:22,756
And I thought I was gonna
get me money tomorrow.

418
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,509
Right.

419
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:29,471
I'll bring me tools round
and I'll sort this place out for you.

420
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,888
- Will ya?
- Yeah, course I will.

421
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,770
Shouldn't take long.

422
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,314
Right, thank you.

423
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,630
"Max Million", to my fucking address?

424
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:48,258
- China, what's in this box?
- Dan, it's not what you think it is.

425
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,756
Don't jump to conclusions.

426
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,310
Shift that bloody rubbish
and shift your arse.

427
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,230
I wanna see what's in this box.

428
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,030
Oh my God. Wow.

429
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:11,584
- What d'you think of these?
- Bloody trainers?

430
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,328
- Trainers.
- Trainers.

431
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,333
- These are only the best, Dan.
- Very best.

432
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,083
Aren't they, Piper?

433
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,377
Aren't they?

434
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,788
Stop it, man, I've got brittle bones.

435
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,839
Anyways, I've got a test for you, Dan.

436
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,591
- Go on, open it.
- Open that.

437
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,181
What's the difference?

438
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,149
Yeah. What's the difference
between them two?

439
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,596
They look the same.

440
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,608
- Bang on, brother.
- Exactly.

441
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:45,611
The difference is, they'd have cost me
150 quid on the high street...

442
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,651
And I'm gonna sell those for 80 quid.

443
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,448
Cheap counterfeits to my fucking address?

444
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,541
I could have the Chinese Mafia
or the bloody Customs at me door.

445
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,618
The brass neck of the bloody pair of you.

446
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,622
Dan, these are not counterfeits.

447
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,040
They're from the same factory as these.

448
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:05,464
Exactly the same quality.
Continuation of the same run.

449
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,428
- D'you not believe us?
- It's fucking genius.

450
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,548
How d'you manage this?

451
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,386
Well I know a guy from Guangzhou, don't I,
who works in the factory.

452
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,060
Yeah, works in the factory.

453
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,387
He's football mad.

454
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:18,143
He knows everything
about the teams, the players, everything.

455
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,056
So we do the deals by e-mails.
I send him the money by PayPal,

456
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,358
then he sends me the package by post.

457
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,521
Me, you mean.

458
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:29,153
Honestly, Dan, I did mean to say,
like I get them sent to different mates.

459
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,489
You know, small packages
like not to attract too much attention.

460
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,124
They usually get through.

461
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,492
I'll be able to tell all me mates
I knew both of you

462
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,213
before you were arrested.

463
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,792
See these trainers, Dan,

464
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,341
these are the future.

465
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:45,922
No more crap jobs.

466
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,304
No more shit from that warehouse.

467
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,133
D'you know what the bastards
did this morning?

468
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:53,511
Got us in at 5:30.

469
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,222
Unloaded one truck.
Guess how long that took?

470
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,104
Forty-five minutes.
And you know how much I got paid?

471
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,517
Three pound and seventy-nine pence.

472
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,728
Waste of my fucking time.
It's worse than China.

473
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,530
I'm gonna make it big
one day, Dan. I'm serious.

474
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,900
Hi there, can I help you?
You look a bit lost.

475
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,020
Aye. I have to apply
for Jobseeker's Allowance...

476
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,486
- Right, yeah. Mmm-hmm.
- And I wanna use one of them

477
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,026
to get on to that Internet web thing.

478
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,490
Right, you could do that today.

479
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,491
We're a bit busy at the moment.

480
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,621
If you can come back a bit later,
would that be okay?

481
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,709
- And then contact Job Centre Plus.
- Mmm-hmm.

482
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,878
And, here we are. "Claim Jobseeker's".

483
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,710
- Okay? So double-click on that one.
- Okay. All right.

484
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,128
And then we need to scroll
right the way down here to continue.

485
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,670
And that's your,
that's your form there for you.

486
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,639
So you need to run the mouse up the screen,

487
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,549
click into there and pop your postcode in.

488
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,887
- Run the mouse up the screen, yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

489
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,639
- No. No, not quite like that.
- No?

490
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,568
- What you need to do is get your cursor...
- "Your cursor"?

491
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:13,228
It's a fucking apt name for it.

492
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,241
So when you're moving your mouse,

493
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,533
- you see what I'm doing with my hand?
- Aye, right.

494
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:20,155
- Look at my hand.
- Aye. Oh, right, it moves like that.

495
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,580
- And then continue.
- Right, okay.

496
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,660
- And then you start from there. Okay?
- Okay.

497
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,956
- I'll leave you with it. Okay?
- Right.

498
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,048
Right.

499
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,717
Excuse me, pet.
You couldn't help us with this, could you?

500
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,678
Yeah. What is it?

501
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,647
I'm just filling this in.
I'm just... I cannot get the...

502
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,605
This keeps darting all over the place.

503
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,648
What do I do? Do I get on to that and...

504
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,404
Do you just...
I mean, how do you get this down?

505
00:28:56,528 --> 00:29:00,028
Right, so you're controlling this,
and you click on this bar.

506
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,619
- Right.
- And then you pull it down.

507
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,949
- Oh, right.
- And then you get...

508
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,576
- What, do I hold that on there, do I? Okay.
- The rest of it. Yeah.

509
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:06,793
- All right, then I can just...
- On the left side.

510
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,583
What, what, so I hold this
and just pull that down?

511
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,286
- Yeah, and click the left.
- And click...

512
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,630
- Click to the left.
- Yeah. Right.

513
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,840
And I just put that in there?
Oh, that's right, thanks very much.

514
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,514
- It's fine.
- Aye.

515
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,973
You're a star. Right.

516
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,270
Right, have I done it right? There we are...

517
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,726
Oh, bloody hell. What's this now?

518
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,729
"Error"?

519
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,729
Well, what have I...

520
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,445
Here, mate, you divvent know
what I've done here, do you?

521
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,701
- This error thing.
- Yeah, that's a big thing.

522
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:45,741
Do you? I don't know, I was just
filling in the thing and it just went...

523
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,659
- There we go.
- Oh, oh, yeah, there we go.

524
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:48,785
We're back on, right.

525
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,173
- You're sorted, yeah?
- Hey, can you just hang on

526
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,170
just for two seconds so I divvent
go back here again. I'll...

527
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,671
Just, just, just, I'll just like do
a couple more questions.

528
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,343
Yeah, I'll just stand over here, don't worry.

529
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,297
Er... "Are you a Br..."

530
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:02,511
- Yeah.
- "Yes". Right. I do that.

531
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,803
- Right. What?
- Yeah.

532
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,099
- What's...
- Then you should continue.

533
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,522
Should be all right.

534
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,770
Right, okay.

535
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,688
What's...

536
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,478
It's, it's, it's not bloody, it's not...

537
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,234
- Well nowt's happening now.
- Yeah, just give it a second.

538
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,725
Just give it a second.

539
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:19,032
But it's just not mov... I mean, look,
it's not even, it's not even moving.

540
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,235
- Let me try, right.
- What? Here, get that.

541
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,779
This is driving me mental, this.
I mean, what have I done now?

542
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,452
- It's frozen. Yeah.
- It's frozen?

543
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,409
Well... Well, can you defrost it?

544
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,039
No, mate, I can't.

545
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,747
Think your time's up.

546
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,050
- What?
- Your time's up.

547
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,471
- Me time's up?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, mate.

548
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,802
Oh, sorry, mate, yeah.

549
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,010
- I'll just leave you to it.
- Oh jeez.

550
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:44,068
- Do you have a partner?
- Er, no. She, er, she's passed away.

551
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,487
- Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

552
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,954
D'you have any dependent children
aged under 20 living with you?

553
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,117
No, I don't.

554
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:56,325
It's really important we get this filled in
because we need to get the process started.

555
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:57,877
Yeah.

556
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:03,917
Excuse me, Ann. Can I have a word, please?

557
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,379
Could you just give me 30 seconds, please?
We're just getting...

558
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,389
Well, actually,
can I have a word now, in my office?

559
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,551
Thank you.

560
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,717
- Right.
- Jesus, I've got you into trouble now.

561
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,600
- I'm really sorry.
- It's me that should be sorry.

562
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,477
You just carry on, you're doing good.

563
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,107
You know, Ann, we've spoke
about this before.

564
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,532
That isn't acceptable.

565
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,900
- I think in this case it's quite reasonable...
- Come on in the office.

566
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,858
The thing is you're setting a precedent.

567
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,156
It's not acceptable.

568
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,666
Oh, bugger. Bugger, it's...

569
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,092
Jesus...

570
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,466
I don't believe this.

571
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:51,007
No, I only want my share of the football.

572
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:54,597
Right then, that's the only team you
need to know in the northeast, is Newcastle.

573
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:55,934
What other teams do you know?

574
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,856
- Er, Middle... Middle-borough.
- Middlesbrough, aye.

575
00:32:58,936 --> 00:32:59,896
- Middlesbrough. Yeah.
- Middlesbrough.

576
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,019
You know, you divvent need to think
about them either. Aye?

577
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,865
There you go.

578
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,815
Er, we only have one Wagon Wheel left,
so I cut it into four.

579
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,870
But you can have two pieces
considering you're the host.

580
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,370
Oh, there you go.
I'll put your tea down there.

581
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,160
- Oh, hang on.
- Barclay's Premier League.

582
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,173
Here's the big question, Stan Li.

583
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:21,958
Did you say "Stan Li"?

584
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,130
Yeah. Stan Li from Guangzhou.

585
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:25,959
Are you two winding me up?

586
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,380
No, that's not our style.

587
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,336
Can you hear me, Stan Li?

588
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,098
Favourite player in the Premier?

589
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,431
Charlie Adams, Stoke City.

590
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,516
Get the fuck out of here.

591
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,977
Are, are you taking the piss?

592
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,937
EPL is crazy money, man.

593
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:47,193
Charlie Adam. Four million.

594
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:48,778
No ego.

595
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,026
Team player.

596
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,031
Tough guy.

597
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:57,579
You see his goal against Chelsea
from his own half?

598
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,581
Boom!

599
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:04,421
The ball flies up, over Courtois' head.
Cross the line, line. Goal!

600
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,633
He's not in China.
He's in the bloody takeaway down the road.

601
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:12,761
You two, you're taking the piss.

602
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:18,024
Okay, Stan Li,
I'll e-mail you my best price. Top price.

603
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:21,021
I'm gonna see how I get on selling
these ones I've got, okay?

604
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,484
So I'll let you know.

605
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,980
Best price, no bullshit.

606
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:28,858
Remember, Charlie Charlie, all good money.

607
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:32,025
Okay, no best price, no more trainer.

608
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:33,606
No more business.

609
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,160
No more talkie-talkie. No more...

610
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,749
# Swing low, sweet chariot

611
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:44,632
# Coming for to carry me home #

612
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:56,887
Right, Dan.
Check your National Insurance Number.

613
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,425
Yep, that's okay.

614
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,430
Press that button right there, Bill Gates.

615
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,604
- What, this one here?
- That one there, "Send."

616
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:10,072
Huh. It's taken me bloody days
to get this sorted out.

617
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,398
Well done, son.

618
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:17,905
Jobseeker's Application done.

619
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:22,043
Dan, don't know why you're applying
for that after your heart attack.

620
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:27,706
Right, now I'm printing your appeal form
for Employment and Support Allowance.

621
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:32,465
But you can't appeal till they carry out
a mandatory reconsideration.

622
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,511
Is that printing out now?

623
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:39,642
You mean, they could have
given it to me just like that?

624
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:44,349
Dan, they'll fuck you around,
I'm warning you.

625
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,557
Make it as miserable as possible.

626
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,864
No accident. That's the plan.

627
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,861
I know dozens who have just given up.

628
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:54,565
Well they've picked the wrong one
if they think I'm gonna give up.

629
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,111
I'm like a dog with a bone, me, son.

630
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,043
I have a note on the screen, sir,

631
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,173
that you're awaiting a call
from the decision maker.

632
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,754
Jesus, 55 minutes to hear all this again.

633
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,258
Am I in a time warp?

634
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,048
You can't proceed to the appeal

635
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,011
or the mandatory reconsideration

636
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,183
till you have the call
from the decision maker.

637
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:21,561
Well, can you ask him to phone us
now, because I've got no income.

638
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:25,142
I've got no pension
and I've still got the bedroom tax.

639
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,600
I'll make a note on my screen, sir.

640
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,475
Well can you not give him the note now?

641
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,145
You know, put it in his hand?

642
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,151
This is a call centre, sir.

643
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,845
Hey, Dylan. D'you want a shot
at the screwdriver?

644
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:14,192
What kills more people,
coconuts or sharks?

645
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:30,077
He likes bouncing that ball, doesn't he?

646
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,128
Pardon?

647
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,878
That ball.
He likes bouncing it, doesn't he?

648
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:38,221
Well, it started in the hostel
where we had only one small room.

649
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,180
Why d'you think he does that?

650
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,060
I think he's missing his friends.

651
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:47,219
But he also does it when he's angry.

652
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:50,563
People never listen to him,
so why should he listen to them?

653
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:05,278
There you go. And we don't need
any glue, nothing like that.

654
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,080
Now you give me a hand
and we'll stick this up.

655
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,996
Right, you go that end and I'll go this end.

656
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,303
And we'll stick this up here.

657
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,383
Yeah? Just pass it up here.

658
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:23,086
Aye, right. You do the bottom edge.
That's it.

659
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:28,811
The sun heats up all
the air in these bubbles...

660
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,266
And it'll keep your room nice and warm.

661
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:38,942
Can you go into my tool bag there,

662
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,283
there's a piece of cloth.

663
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,284
Can you open it?

664
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:50,536
Eh?

665
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,294
- What do you think of that?
- It's gorgeous.

666
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:02,594
Well it's a little present for
your new room.

667
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:04,297
- Now...
- Thank you.

668
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,219
- Where shall we put it?
- Up there, maybe.

669
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,144
Okay, hang on.

670
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:11,731
I'll get a hook and hang it there.

671
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,765
Yeah, what do you think?

672
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,441
It's great.

673
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,313
It'll look like you're under the sea.

674
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:20,525
And the sun will shine on them.

675
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,988
I think there will be fine, yeah?

676
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,315
I'll light these candles.

677
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:30,576
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

678
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,249
- Now hang on.
- That one's big.

679
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,919
It is. Now there's four candles. Right?

680
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,332
Mind you don't burn yourself.

681
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,959
I won't burn meself,
don't worry about that.

682
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,960
But thank you for thinking about us, Daisy.

683
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,295
Put that in there like that.

684
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:48,007
And I put this one in here.
Now there's four candles in there, right.

685
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,755
And they last for four hours.

686
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,728
I'll put this small pot over. Right?

687
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,147
Block the hole off up there.

688
00:39:57,188 --> 00:40:00,358
And then I put this big pot over the top.

689
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:05,282
Now it takes a little while
but it'll take the chill off the room.

690
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:09,328
And if you just put your hand
over there now, you'll feel it, Daisy.

691
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,158
If you just put your hand over there,
you'll feel it starting to warm up.

692
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,832
- Huh, can you feel it? Yeah?
- A little bit.

693
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,536
- What about you?
- Yeah, a little bit.

694
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,502
Were you a soldier, Dan?

695
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,207
Was I a soldier?

696
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,719
Oh, more dangerous than that.
I was a carpenter.

697
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,381
Right, grub's ready.

698
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,930
- Yay!
- Go round that way then, Dylan.

699
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:31,063
Good boy. There's yours, poppet.

700
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,432
Right, put Sweet on there.

701
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,639
Sit down nicely then.

702
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,857
- And, Dan, this one's yours.
- Oh, no, not for me, thanks, no.

703
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,404
That's yours. All right?

704
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,030
Here you are. All right?

705
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:50,324
- Well, where's yours?
- I had mine earlier.

706
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,777
I'm just gonna have a bit of fruit.

707
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,499
You said that yesterday,
and the day before.

708
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,160
All right, eat up then.

709
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,293
Looks delicious but, you know,
it's a wee... It's a wee bit early for me.

710
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:03,844
Please, Dan. It's the least I can do.

711
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,222
- Thank you, Katie.
- All right.

712
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:08,237
What was that sound, Mum?

713
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,985
Oh, babe, one of the tiles just fell off
the wall in the bathroom

714
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:12,323
where I was cleaning it.

715
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,410
It's the middle of the night.

716
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,700
- I know.
- You should really get to bed.

717
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:15,985
Okay. I'm gonna go to bed.

718
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:17,158
I'm gonna go to bed.

719
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,906
I just wanted to
get all the cleaning done in there

720
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,498
so you can have a nice bath tomorrow.

721
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:22,498
You like a bath, don't ya?

722
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:23,915
Yeah?

723
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:26,625
So you're gonna go up
and get into bed and wrap up nicely.

724
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,514
Okay, good girl. Give me a kiss.

725
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,553
Go and get into bed.

726
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:37,514
- All right? Good girl.
- Promise me you'll get to bed.

727
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,520
I promise you I'm gonna go to bed.

728
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,977
- Good night.
- 'Night, baby.

729
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,458
Daniel Blake?

730
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,456
If you'd like to follow me, Mr Blake.

731
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,717
If you'd like to just take a seat.

732
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:11,728
This is the Claimant Commitment form.

733
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:15,609
You must commit yourself to spending
35 hours a week looking for work.

734
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:19,071
Now that can be newspapers, agencies,

735
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:22,616
and online via the Universal Job Match.

736
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,619
You just fill in the details.

737
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:28,878
But you must prove that
you've done this as well, mind.

738
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:32,956
Well I've been told by my doctor
that I'm not supposed to go back to work yet.

739
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:36,218
Then you should apply
for Employment and Support Allowance.

740
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,643
I have, but I've been knocked
back by some quack

741
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,432
and now I'm trying to appeal.

742
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,595
Okay. Well that's your choice, Mr Blake.

743
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,890
No, it's not my choice.

744
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:49,193
I've got no other form of income.

745
00:44:50,022 --> 00:44:52,782
Do you want to sign this or not?

746
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:58,985
You just need to put your
signature here. I shall date it later on.

747
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:07,211
Thank you.

748
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:09,915
Now can I have a look at your CV?

749
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:11,667
"CV"?

750
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:15,299
You still don't get this, do you, Mr Blake?

751
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,640
This is an agreement between
you and the State.

752
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:22,599
No, you still don't get it.

753
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:25,602
- No, you must...
- I'm desperate to go back to work.

754
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:28,812
- If you're desperate to get back to work...
- Unless the doctor tells us...

755
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:30,896
You need to have an up-to-date CV,

756
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:33,231
in order to help you look for work.

757
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:35,114
Now, just hold it right there.

758
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:39,662
There's a CV workshop
that I would like you to attend

759
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,699
and it's this Saturday at 9:00.

760
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:46,286
No, thanks, I'll sort that out on me own.

761
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:51,168
No, Mr Blake. This is a formal direction.

762
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,710
You will attend if you want to proceed
with your Jobseeker's Allowance claim.

763
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:58,632
What happens if I don't?

764
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:01,715
Then you will be referred for a sanction.

765
00:46:07,683 --> 00:46:08,773
Ten seconds.

766
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,346
Ten short seconds.

767
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:16,939
That's how much a typical employer
spends flipping through a CV.

768
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,399
Fact.

769
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:22,156
Sixty applications for every low-skilled job.

770
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,281
Fact.

771
00:46:23,407 --> 00:46:26,737
For a skilled job, it's twenty to one.

772
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:27,950
Fact.

773
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:31,785
Costa Coffee advertised eight jobs.

774
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:35,293
D'you know how many applications
they got from that?

775
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,796
Over 1,300.

776
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,420
Fact.

777
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:42,795
So, what does that mean?

778
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:45,432
We should all be drinking
a lot more bloody coffee.

779
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:47,352
Yeah, d'you wanna share that with us?

780
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:50,064
I said, we should all be drinking
a lot more bloody coffee then.

781
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:51,854
This is serious business

782
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:54,347
and people have only got
one shot at this, all right?

783
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:57,726
Well if you can count, it's obvious.
There's not enough jobs. Fact.

784
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:00,566
Yeah, well, you'll be at
the back of the queue, won't you?

785
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:03,909
For those of us in the real world,

786
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:07,331
what that means is...

787
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:16,456
"You must stand

788
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:21,257
"out from the crowd."

789
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:26,969
Get noticed. Get smart.

790
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:30,683
It's not enough these days just to, er,

791
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:32,808
just to show you have the skills.

792
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:35,018
You have to prove

793
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,070
how keen you are. How dedicated.

794
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:40,781
Okay...

795
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:45,031
What I'd like you to do now
is to, er, format your CVs.

796
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:49,945
And, remember, all of these
have to be typed up in a clear font

797
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:51,866
in hard copy.

798
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:55,706
And we're also gonna need
a digital version for online.

799
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,830
And some companies,

800
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:03,215
they're demanding CV videos,
sent in by smartphone.

801
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:04,844
How about that?

802
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:08,007
Okay? Let's make a start.

803
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,870
Are you taking any blokes on, mate?

804
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,792
I'm a joiner, you know
I'm just looking for some work, you know.

805
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,706
Not at the minute. Er, all manned up.

806
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,465
Okay, can, can I give you my CV?
And then if you can get in touch...

807
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:55,428
- Excuse me, mate.
- Yeah.

808
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:57,889
D'you know if anybody's
taking anybody on round here?

809
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:00,363
Er, no, we're not taking anyone on.

810
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,900
Er, I'll tell you what you could do.

811
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:05,898
If you try about three units
up on the left there,

812
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,903
they'll probably...
They, they might be havin' one.

813
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,740
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay? Cheers, mate.

814
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:13,948
- Your best bet is to see him.
- Is he the boss? Him?

815
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:15,832
He's, he's the supervisor.
That's the boss there.

816
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:23,922
Excuse me, mate. D'you know if
they're taking anybody on here?

817
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:25,919
Have you got any jobs ganning?

818
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,048
No, you haven't?

819
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,553
Hey, mate, I'm looking for some work.

820
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,723
- Is there anything ganning on around here?
- There's nowt here, mate. There's...

821
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,851
There might be something,
erm, a bit further up,

822
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,943
- if you try one of the other estates, but...
- Yeah?

823
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:40,941
...nothing doing on here.

824
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,158
Help you, mate?

825
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:57,907
Aye, I was just looking for some work, mate.

826
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,916
I was wondering if you had
anything ganning on?

827
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:01,582
I might have.

828
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:02,708
- Aye?
- Done this graft before?

829
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:05,714
- You got any experience?
- Oh, I've got 40 years of experience, mate.

830
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,627
I can turn me hand to owt.
Can I give you me CV?

831
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:09,416
Way-ay, course, I'll have a look at it.

832
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:13,217
There you go.

833
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:15,971
Cheers.

834
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,930
- Daniel?
- Aye, that's me.

835
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,516
I'm Harry, by the way.

836
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,270
Well, you've got plenty
of experience, like, I've gotta be honest,

837
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:25,902
I'm absolutely sick of young'uns.

838
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:28,612
Half the time they divvent turn up.
When they do, they cannot be arsed.

839
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,865
Dylan, Dylan, come off the road, come on.

840
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:42,455
Come on.

841
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,835
Dylan, come on. Catch up. Come on.

842
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,686
- Is this the, er, queue for the food bank?
- It is, aye.

843
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:03,940
D'you know how long we'll be waiting?

844
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,020
Oh, a canny long time, I reckon.
We've been here ages already.

845
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:08,732
Okay, thanks. Cheers.

846
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:47,225
- Hello.
- Hello.

847
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,444
How nice to see you.

848
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,606
Have you brought your little dog today?

849
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:53,697
Thank you very much, thank you.

850
00:51:57,449 --> 00:52:00,997
Is it just food for yourself
and the two children, Katie? Thank you.

851
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,617
Would your children have
a drink of juice and a biscuit?

852
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,790
Would you like to go and see Agnes?

853
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:09,126
Agnes?
Could you do a juice and a biscuit, please?

854
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:13,048
- Jackie?
- Yeah.

855
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,841
Would you be able to
help Katie with her shopping today, please?

856
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,297
- There you are.
- Thank you.

857
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:20,307
Hiya, Katie. Thank you.

858
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:25,103
So, we've got one adult and two
children, yeah? Come with me.

859
00:52:25,352 --> 00:52:27,942
- We'll start with the vegetables, yeah?
- Okay.

860
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,476
Right.

861
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:34,565
I'll give you one side
and we'll share it, yeah?

862
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:38,412
- Couple of onions.
- Is there anything we can do for you, hun?

863
00:52:38,532 --> 00:52:40,122
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- Are you sure?

864
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:42,115
- Aye, all right then.
- Toiletries, yeah?

865
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:44,868
Okay...

866
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,373
Have you just moved up here?
Your accent's not from here.

867
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:49,959
- You're not a Geordie girl.
- Yeah. Yeah, been up a little while.

868
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:51,165
Just come up from London.

869
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:53,134
Right. Nice accent.

870
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:55,051
Can you understand the Geordies?

871
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:56,301
Almost.

872
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,223
Right, over here.

873
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:00,683
I think we need another bag.
Have we got one?

874
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:02,597
Did you bus here?

875
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:05,809
- No? Well, sometimes.
- Well, sometimes.

876
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,732
She likes tea sometimes.

877
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:10,066
- Well, I'll just keep going in with stuff.
- Yeah.

878
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,856
And then you tell me
what you don't need, yeah?

879
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:13,232
Have you got any sanitary towels?

880
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:16,398
- We don't have sanitary towels, no.
- No? All right, not to worry. It's all right.

881
00:53:16,528 --> 00:53:18,068
- Don't really donate things much like that.
- Yeah.

882
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:19,614
It's a shame, they should.

883
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:23,163
Right, right, if you open your bag. Rice?

884
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:35,009
- And a couple of toilet rolls?
- Mmm-hmm.

885
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,170
Yeah?

886
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,130
We'll go to the food.
It's falling out me bag.

887
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:41,717
- You can put...
- I've got this one. Right.

888
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,929
Erm, tins in yours. Put them in there.

889
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,314
Can you see anything else you want?

890
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:52,436
- There you go.
- Okay, thank you.

891
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:55,074
- Erm, there's pasta sauce over here.
- Mmm-hmm.

892
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:56,991
I'll get you some pasta sauce?

893
00:53:57,986 --> 00:53:59,316
The pasta sauce...

894
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:05,867
And there's, er, pasta here as well.
I'll get you a pasta.

895
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,210
Hey, pet, are you all right?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

896
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:20,091
Come and sit down. It's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.

897
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:22,338
Come and sit down.
Come and sit down, it's all right.

898
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:24,222
Oh...

899
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:30,137
Okay, it's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.

900
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:31,556
It's all right. D'you want a drink?

901
00:54:31,895 --> 00:54:34,225
- D'you want a drink?
- I'm really sorry...

902
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:37,227
- What's the matter?
- It's okay, don't worry.

903
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,649
- I'll get you a drink.
- Mum, what's going on?

904
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:41,608
It's okay. It's okay

905
00:54:42,906 --> 00:54:45,366
I'm just really hungry.

906
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:50,245
- Okay, don't look at me.
- No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

907
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:53,423
There's no harm done.

908
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,588
I can't cope, Dan.
I feel like I'm going under.

909
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:01,628
Look, you'll get through this, darling.

910
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,255
- Thank you.
- You'll get through this.

911
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,465
Katie, listen to me.
This isn't your fault.

912
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,230
You've done amazing.

913
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,850
Dumped up here, on your own with two kids.

914
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:14,899
You've done nothing to be ashamed of.

915
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,940
Come on, you're okay.

916
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:18,395
Come on, wipe yourself.

917
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,486
Come on... You're okay.

918
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:26,237
- If my mum could see me...
- It's okay.

919
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:29,947
Look, these people are here to help you.

920
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:31,956
You know, you've done nothing
to be ashamed of.

921
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,000
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, you're all right.

922
00:55:34,124 --> 00:55:35,714
- Can I get you anything else?
- I just felt really faint.

923
00:55:35,917 --> 00:55:38,214
D'you need some paper
tissues or baby wipes?

924
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:40,304
- I'll get you some baby wipes.
- Thank you.

925
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:44,178
I felt really faint.

926
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:48,054
Katie, can I get you something to eat?
Would you like some soup or something?

927
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,389
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
If you could get her some water.

928
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:53,015
Sure, yeah, anything. Yeah.
You not want some food?

929
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:55,231
- Yeah, please, get...
- Even something sugary.

930
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:56,861
I'll get you a doughnut or something.

931
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,190
Yeah, yeah?

932
00:56:08,158 --> 00:56:10,328
There's no middlemen.
Straight from the factory.

933
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:11,999
Same quality as the shop.

934
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,250
- Same quality, exactly.
- Well, you're gonna have to do us a deal.

935
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,251
I couldn't pay 80 quid for this, though.

936
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:17,671
If you go to the shop, they're 150 pounds.

937
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,632
- A hundred and fifty quid?
- I'm selling these for 80 pounds.

938
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:21,843
- Only 80 quid.
- See, they've still got the stickers on.

939
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:24,593
Why are they 80?

940
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:27,638
The reason they're 80 is because
there's no middlemen, nothing.

941
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:30,761
- No middlemen, whatsoever.
- You and Piper, the top new businessmen.

942
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:32,268
That's my driver, Dan.

943
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,558
I'll give you a bloody driver.

944
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,390
So no-one's worn them before?

945
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:37,438
No-one's wore them. Nothing, look.
Check the quality yourself.

946
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:39,152
I'd probably wear them for the gym.

947
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:41,691
I couldn't say 80 quid, mate.
This is too expensive for 80 quid.

948
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:44,486
- They're 150 pound in the shop.
- A hundred and fifty pound, yeah.

949
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:50,584
- Oh, Dan. You all right, mate?
- Hello, Joe.

950
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:53,577
- Aye, I'm all right, mate, aye.
- How are you doing?

951
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:57,293
Erm, listen, we're ganning, erm...
We're away down the pub the night.

952
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:59,333
There's a load of us ganning.
There's a band on, you know.

953
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:02,298
We're gonna sink a few pints.
D'you fancy, fancy coming down?

954
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:06,218
Aye, I'd murder a pint, mate, but I daresn't.
I've been telt to lay off the sauce, you know.

955
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:08,304
- Oh, really?
- But, listen, tell the lads I'll come down

956
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:09,844
and pop into the sawmill, eh?

957
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:11,389
Oh, aye, aye, aye.

958
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:13,886
You know, if you fancy it anyway,
we're all going down.

959
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:15,385
So we might see you later, mate.

960
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:17,595
- Nice to see you, man.
- See you then. Ta-ta, see you.

961
00:57:28,238 --> 00:57:29,778
Message for Daniel Blake.

962
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:33,411
Mr Blake, this is a call
from the DWP decision maker.

963
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,700
You should soon receive a letter

964
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:38,209
which states that you have been
deemed fit for work

965
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:41,294
and not entitled to Employment
and Support Allowance.

966
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:43,633
If you need any further information,

967
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:46,417
it's available online. Thank you.

968
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,466
Fuck's sake.

969
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:15,793
- Hello?
- Hi, is that Daniel?

970
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,290
Yes, it is. Hi.

971
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:18,872
Hi, Daniel, it's Harry Edwards here.

972
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:20,327
We spoke the other day
at the garden centre...

973
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:22,166
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- ...when you came down and handed your CV.

974
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:25,002
- How are you doing, mate? Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, thanks, yeah.

975
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:27,761
Er, listen. I tell you what, mate,
I've been going through all the CVs

976
00:58:27,881 --> 00:58:29,551
I've had handed over
the last couple of weeks.

977
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:31,304
And I really like the look of yours.

978
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:33,256
Erm, you've got the experience
I'm looking for.

979
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:36,679
I was wondering if you could possibly, er,
pop by tomorrow and that for an interview?

980
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:40,143
Oh... I'm really sorry, er, Mr Edwards,

981
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:43,478
but, you know, er, my doctor's told
us I cannae come back to work yet.

982
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,484
So you're not actually
looking for work, then?

983
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:49,363
Well, it's hard to explain, you know.

984
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:52,775
So, well, what's the point
of handing in your CV

985
00:58:52,906 --> 00:58:54,486
if you're not looking for work?

986
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,909
Well it's the only way
I can get me benefits, you know?

987
00:58:57,535 --> 00:59:01,115
"Benefits"? So you prefer to be on
benefits than do a day's graft?

988
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,747
You know, I thought you were
a genuine bloke.

989
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,003
You know, I've spent a lot of time
going through them all.

990
00:59:05,126 --> 00:59:06,706
I've... I was gonna put some graft your way.

991
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,050
You've just wasted my time completely.
Why don't you just sod right off!

992
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,550
Listen, that's not...

993
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:44,460
- That's your change and your receipt.
- Thank you.

994
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,500
- Thank you very much. Have a good day.
- Bye.

995
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:48,044
- Bye.
- Thank you, bye.

996
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:50,549
Excuse me, madam.
I think you've been shoplifting.

997
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:53,677
Would you like to come with me to
the manager's office and we can sort it out?

998
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,217
I haven't been shoplifting.

999
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:57,595
Okay, you have, and I've seen you.
So if you'd like to come with me...

1000
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,180
No, I've got a receipt. I've got, I've just,

1001
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,845
- the lady there's just served me.
- Okay, and if everything on your receipt

1002
01:00:01,975 --> 01:00:03,305
is all you've got on you,
then there's no problem.

1003
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,481
If you'd just like to come this way
to the manager's office.

1004
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:06,482
No, I'm not going to the manager's office.

1005
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:08,772
You just stood there and watched
her serve me, I've got a receipt.

1006
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:10,398
I can lock the door and call the police.

1007
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:12,395
You're talking about locking the
door and calling the police.

1008
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:14,027
Would you like to come with me
to the manager's office?

1009
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:15,573
No, because I've just, you've
just watched me...

1010
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:17,324
Okay, and we'll sort that out.

1011
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,448
Okay, and if everything
on the receipt's in your bags,

1012
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:21,195
- then there's no problem.
- You don't need to shout at me.

1013
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:22,747
Okay, if you'd like to come this way.

1014
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:25,708
She's just, you've just stood
there and watched it...

1015
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:28,082
- Okay, then we'll sort it out.
- ...and serve me with, didn't you?

1016
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:29,589
And she's given me a receipt.

1017
01:00:29,794 --> 01:00:30,844
Just this way.

1018
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,440
Ivan, I'll take it from here.

1019
01:00:52,984 --> 01:00:54,404
What's your name, love?

1020
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,489
- Katie.
- Katie?

1021
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,742
- Katie Morgan.
- Katie Morgan.

1022
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:00,277
I'm really sorry.

1023
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:03,076
I haven't done anything like this before.
I've paid for these.

1024
01:01:07,165 --> 01:01:08,745
What are you gonna do?

1025
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,250
Katie.

1026
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,470
It's between me and you...

1027
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:18,974
It's got nowt to do with the store.
All right?

1028
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:21,966
They're paid for.

1029
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:27,854
Get yoursel' away.

1030
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:33,858
Thank you.

1031
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:50,628
Hey, hang on a second. Hey, hang on...

1032
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,088
I'm sorry about that, I am.

1033
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:54,999
Can I get a quiet word?

1034
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:00,340
Look, if you're in trouble and you
need money, I can help, okay?

1035
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:03,349
Look, a nice girl like you,
I can definitely help.

1036
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,100
That's my number. My name's Ivan, okay?

1037
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:13,107
Ring me any time, all right?

1038
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:14,521
Okay?

1039
01:02:35,962 --> 01:02:37,842
Come and have a look at this.

1040
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:41,966
That is a miracle.

1041
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:43,763
He's been sat there for about 15 minutes.

1042
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:03,107
What's this, Dan?

1043
01:03:03,698 --> 01:03:04,738
It's a cassette.

1044
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:06,119
What's a cassette?

1045
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:08,122
Plays music. Come here, I'll show you.

1046
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,790
All right.

1047
01:03:17,128 --> 01:03:20,208
You pop that in there.
Oh, no, you gotta take it out the case first.

1048
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:23,376
It'll not play like that.

1049
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:26,177
Right, you put that in there like that. Yeah?

1050
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:28,927
And press that button there.

1051
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:33,523
Bit more. Harder.

1052
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,060
That's it.

1053
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:38,321
It was Molly's.

1054
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,990
She recorded it off the radio.

1055
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:42,777
Shipping forecast.

1056
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:44,784
It's on late at night.

1057
01:03:45,448 --> 01:03:48,488
Sailing By. D'you like that tune?

1058
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:50,748
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Molly loved it.

1059
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:59,173
It's nice, isn't it?

1060
01:04:11,224 --> 01:04:12,434
So how'd the interview go?

1061
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:15,388
Oh, nothing's working out
with the school times at the minute.

1062
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:18,811
So I went to, erm, some of the agencies
and put my name down on the waiting list,

1063
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:20,822
cos I could do cleaning in the morning.

1064
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:23,820
Went to some hotels.
Went round all the cafes.

1065
01:04:24,153 --> 01:04:25,573
Must have walked for bloody miles.

1066
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:27,491
Well, I can pick the kids
up for you, you know.

1067
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:29,033
Till I start work again.

1068
01:04:35,706 --> 01:04:38,206
Dan. The answer is "coconuts".

1069
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,960
Correct.

1070
01:04:41,504 --> 01:04:42,844
What's he talking about, "coconuts"?

1071
01:04:43,214 --> 01:04:45,054
Ah, shall we tell your mum?

1072
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:50,428
- Go on.
- When I was bouncing my ball on the stairs.

1073
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,766
- What stairs?
- The stairs in our house.

1074
01:04:52,848 --> 01:04:55,728
- Yeah.
- Dan asked me a question.

1075
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:57,441
What, what question did he ask ya?

1076
01:04:57,853 --> 01:04:59,693
"What kills people more?

1077
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:01,777
- "Coconuts or sharks?"
- Mmm-hmm.

1078
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:03,187
And I said coconuts.

1079
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:04,357
And you got it right?

1080
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:05,855
- Is that right?
- Yeah, he's right.

1081
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:12,699
Is that Molly?

1082
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,410
Yeah. Yeah, that's Molly, yeah.

1083
01:05:17,415 --> 01:05:18,865
Let's see that, Dais.

1084
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,880
Show me that one.

1085
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:27,299
"Molly." Like the name.

1086
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,640
What was she like?

1087
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:31,926
She was special.

1088
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:35,677
Yeah, she was special, Daisy.

1089
01:05:37,143 --> 01:05:38,523
Not easy.

1090
01:05:40,563 --> 01:05:42,273
She was up one minute, down the next.

1091
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:46,902
Smart and funny. Huh.

1092
01:05:48,738 --> 01:05:50,908
Ah, that lass made me laugh.

1093
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:54,078
Kind.

1094
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,040
She had a big, big heart.

1095
01:05:58,914 --> 01:05:59,924
But...

1096
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:04,377
She said her head was like the ocean.

1097
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:09,092
Dead still, then wild.

1098
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:12,925
Never knew where she'd end up next.

1099
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:16,354
I mean, the music helped that.

1100
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:19,693
But then she'd hit the rocks.

1101
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:22,363
"Where'll we sail to tonight, Dan?"

1102
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:24,398
That was our little joke.

1103
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,190
Her last words to me were,

1104
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:33,994
"I wanna sail away, Dan,
with the wind at me back.

1105
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:37,121
"That's all I need, Dan."

1106
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:41,084
Do you have any children?

1107
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,128
I'd have loved that, Daisy. No.

1108
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:48,344
- Do you miss her?
- Dais.

1109
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:50,086
It's okay.

1110
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:52,966
She was crazy.

1111
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:55,763
Hard work.

1112
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,234
But I loved her to bits.

1113
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,648
I'm lost without her, really.

1114
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:10,404
- There you go, pet.
- Oh, thank you.

1115
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:12,985
That must have been hard for you, Dan.

1116
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:14,989
I mean, did you look after her
right till the end?

1117
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:19,995
Well, you know, I thought it'd be
a relief when she passed away.

1118
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:24,039
Cos it was difficult to go into work,
you know, when she was ill.

1119
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:28,166
And after you've been looking after
somebody for so long...

1120
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:30,756
It seems to take over your life, you know.

1121
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,973
- Yeah, and you forget your own.
- Huh.

1122
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:36,394
Well she was lucky to have you.

1123
01:07:38,139 --> 01:07:41,769
Daisy's dad, I thought was
something really special.

1124
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:44,228
He turned out not to be.

1125
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,980
Me mum tried to warn me about it,
but I was 18, so I didn't listen.

1126
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:51,034
And then I did the same
thing with Dylan's dad.

1127
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:54,611
You're a young lass,
you got your whole life ahead of you.

1128
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:58,033
And when you get back
to those books, you'll be flying.

1129
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:01,164
Yeah, I can't look at 'em, Dan.
They really upset me.

1130
01:08:03,998 --> 01:08:06,038
- You gotta keep a hold, you know.
- Mmm-hmm.

1131
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,287
You're doing your kids proud.

1132
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:16,053
I mean, we all need the wind
at our back every now and then.

1133
01:08:16,469 --> 01:08:18,719
- Don't we?
- Mmm. Yeah.

1134
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,108
Well that's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1135
01:08:32,651 --> 01:08:36,491
And how do I know you've actually
been in contact with all these employers?

1136
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,698
Well, I walked round the town.
I gave out me CV by hand.

1137
01:08:41,619 --> 01:08:42,949
Well, prove it.

1138
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:45,747
- How?
- Well, did you get a receipt?

1139
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,500
Take a picture with your mobile?

1140
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:50,094
With this?

1141
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:52,586
I give you my word that's what I did.

1142
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:54,418
That's not good enough, Mr Blake.

1143
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:58,007
What about the Universal Job Match online?

1144
01:08:58,886 --> 01:09:02,096
I went to the library,
there's my appointment card.

1145
01:09:05,226 --> 01:09:08,396
Did my head in. And I tried my best.

1146
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:11,108
It's not good enough.

1147
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,817
Can I look at your CV?

1148
01:09:14,193 --> 01:09:15,243
All right.

1149
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:29,117
Did you not learn anything
at the CV workshop?

1150
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:30,956
You'd be surprised.

1151
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:34,758
Not good enough, Sheila?

1152
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:38,512
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refer you

1153
01:09:38,634 --> 01:09:42,144
to a decision maker for a possible
sanction for four weeks.

1154
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:45,427
Your payment will be frozen.

1155
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:48,691
You may be entitled
to Hardship Allowance if you apply.

1156
01:09:49,562 --> 01:09:50,982
Do you understand?

1157
01:09:52,147 --> 01:09:56,317
And if you are sanctioned, you must
continue to look for work and sign on.

1158
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:59,363
If you don't, you may be sanctioned again.

1159
01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:04,155
And it's likely to be for thirteen weeks
on the second occasion, and thereafter.

1160
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:08,751
And likely to be the maximum
of up to three years.

1161
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:13,165
Would you like me to write
you a referral to a food bank?

1162
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,910
Dan, you're not leaving, are you?

1163
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:49,623
Aye, I'm off to the Bahamas.

1164
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:53,206
Nah, I'm just sick of the old stuff.
I need a change.

1165
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:55,586
Are you okay, Dan?

1166
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:58,012
I'm fine, son.

1167
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,010
You don't look okay.

1168
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:01,629
No, really, I'm fine.

1169
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:04,926
You haven't given us a row
about leaving the rubbish out.

1170
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:07,351
I'm okay, China, really.

1171
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:10,596
If you need anything, Dan, let me know.

1172
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,230
Absolutely anything.

1173
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:17,020
I mean it, Dan, anything.

1174
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:18,821
I know, son.

1175
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:23,527
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a hundred.

1176
01:11:23,656 --> 01:11:27,236
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, two hundred.

1177
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,200
All right?

1178
01:11:30,829 --> 01:11:32,159
Aye, fair enough.

1179
01:11:32,748 --> 01:11:34,248
Anything else I can help you with?

1180
01:11:35,084 --> 01:11:36,174
No, that's it.

1181
01:11:43,759 --> 01:11:44,799
What about these?

1182
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:46,262
Good quality hand tools.

1183
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:50,272
Nae chance. I'll be ganning back
to work soon enough.

1184
01:11:50,683 --> 01:11:52,773
Well, the offer's there.

1185
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:57,265
Now these look nice. How much d'you want?

1186
01:11:58,065 --> 01:11:59,265
They're not for sale, mate.

1187
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:03,025
Give us a ring if you change
your mind. See you now.

1188
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:43,322
What are you doing?

1189
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:47,162
Oh, you're freezing.

1190
01:12:48,824 --> 01:12:49,874
What's wrong?

1191
01:12:51,326 --> 01:12:55,156
Well, erm, the girls at school
are making fun of me.

1192
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:57,328
They're what?

1193
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,666
The girls at school are making fun of me.

1194
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:02,337
Why are they making fun of you?

1195
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:05,088
My shoes fell apart.

1196
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:06,340
Oh, did they?

1197
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:09,635
But we glued them back together.

1198
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,642
- Mmm.
- They fell apart again?

1199
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:16,983
All right, we can get you
a new pair of shoes.

1200
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:18,729
We don't have the money.

1201
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:21,774
Don't you worry about that,
we can get you a new pair of shoes.

1202
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:24,315
Okay.

1203
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:29,159
One of the girls heard about
what happened at the food bank.

1204
01:13:30,741 --> 01:13:32,871
And they're saying
things to you about that, are they?

1205
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:35,656
We'll get it sorted, don't you worry.

1206
01:13:38,332 --> 01:13:39,462
D'you wanna sleep here with me?

1207
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:43,375
Yeah? All right, babe,
roll over then. Tuck in.

1208
01:13:44,296 --> 01:13:47,666
That's it. Roll right over. I'll tuck you in.

1209
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:50,473
Good girl.

1210
01:14:16,495 --> 01:14:17,535
Hello?

1211
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:19,210
Hello, is that Ivan?

1212
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,420
It is, yeah. Who's that?

1213
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,339
It's, it's Katie,
the girl at the supermarket.

1214
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:26,419
You gave me... You gave me
your phone number.

1215
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:28,633
Okay, I remember you.

1216
01:14:29,216 --> 01:14:32,756
Yeah, I was, erm... I was ringing about
the work that you were talking about.

1217
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:13,887
It's nice to meet you.

1218
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:31,406
You don't need to be nervous
with me. I can see you're in pain.

1219
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:33,236
You don't... You don't need to be, all right?

1220
01:15:33,488 --> 01:15:35,488
I'm gonna help you. Okay?

1221
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:37,411
So, don't cry, right.

1222
01:15:37,492 --> 01:15:39,492
I don't want you to cry, I'm gonna help you.

1223
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:42,788
I know the situation. Ivan's told us a little
bit about you and, you know,

1224
01:15:42,915 --> 01:15:44,875
and that's what I'm here for.
I am gonna help you.

1225
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:51,505
Hey, ya.

1226
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:53,507
- All right?
- Yeah.

1227
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:55,514
Did they, er, they go down all right?

1228
01:15:55,636 --> 01:15:58,506
Nae bother. Both fast asleep. How'd it go?

1229
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:02,729
Yeah, it was good, it was good.
It was a, it was a single-parent meeting.

1230
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:05,808
One of the mums came and spoke
to me afterwards, she was really nice.

1231
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:07,442
Ah, there's some good people round, yeah.

1232
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:08,522
Yeah.

1233
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:12,395
Make sure you take care
of yourself, Dan, won't ya?

1234
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:13,737
- Course I will.
- All right.

1235
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:15,534
- See you soon.
- Good night.

1236
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:19,527
- Give my love to the kids in the morning.
- I will do.

1237
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,250
- Thank you.
- 'Night.

1238
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:29,596
Dan, it's me. Erm, thank you
for coming round tonight.

1239
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:34,194
Daisy woke up and she forgot to ask
you about her school project.

1240
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:37,071
She's, erm, she's gotta interview
somebody about their work

1241
01:17:37,195 --> 01:17:38,605
and she wants to speak to you.

1242
01:17:39,364 --> 01:17:41,454
Oh, and they, they loved all your stories.

1243
01:17:42,034 --> 01:17:44,624
She said that Dylan was just
laughing and laughing.

1244
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,710
It was lovely. Nearly made me cry
when she told me.

1245
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:54,627
All right, I'll speak to you soon.
Sleep well. 'Night.

1246
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:42,966
I've come to see the girl.

1247
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:44,680
Okay. Come in.

1248
01:18:51,895 --> 01:18:53,765
Erm, do I pay you?

1249
01:18:54,106 --> 01:18:56,686
No, you pay the girl. It's that door there.

1250
01:18:57,692 --> 01:18:58,692
Right.

1251
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:10,663
Oh, no, Dan.

1252
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:17,087
Katie, you don't need to do this.

1253
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:21,428
You shouldn't see me like this.

1254
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:24,091
I'm sorry.

1255
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:28,809
No, this, this is cut off. This is separate.
Can you... You need to get out.

1256
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:34,725
Listen, I couldn't speak to you in the flat,
I need to speak to you now.

1257
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,820
Dan, please, get out.

1258
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:39,652
Oh, Katie, please, I need to speak to you.

1259
01:19:42,863 --> 01:19:44,659
I just wanna speak to you. Katie!

1260
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:46,739
Dan, please, just go.

1261
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:53,123
Dan, please, I don't want you here!
Will you just go, please!

1262
01:19:55,709 --> 01:19:57,749
- I've built you a bookcase.
- What?

1263
01:19:57,961 --> 01:19:59,051
For your books.

1264
01:19:59,713 --> 01:20:01,973
Oh, Dan. Please, just go.

1265
01:20:02,716 --> 01:20:04,966
- Please, just go, I don't want you here.
- This is breaking my heart.

1266
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:07,143
Dan, please, just leave me alone.

1267
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:20,106
I've got 300 quid in my pocket.

1268
01:20:21,401 --> 01:20:23,151
I can buy the kids fresh fruit.

1269
01:20:29,784 --> 01:20:31,794
If you can't deal with it,
I can't see you any more.

1270
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:35,081
Listen, I've gotta go back inside.
D'you understand?

1271
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:39,963
I don't wanna speak to you any more.

1272
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,300
And don't show me any more love.

1273
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:48,141
Cos you're gonna break me, Dan.

1274
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:18,424
I don't understand.

1275
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:21,795
So what jobs have you actually applied for?

1276
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:25,215
It's a monumental farce, isn't it?

1277
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,850
You sitting there with your
friendly name tag on your chest, Ann,

1278
01:21:32,222 --> 01:21:36,022
opposite a sick man looking
for nonexistent jobs,

1279
01:21:36,476 --> 01:21:38,396
that I can't take anyway.

1280
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:42,940
Wasting my time, employers' time, your time.

1281
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:47,651
And all it does is humiliate me,
grind me down.

1282
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:51,203
Or is that the point,
to get my name off those computers?

1283
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:54,371
Well, I'm not doing it any more.

1284
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:56,039
I've had enough.

1285
01:21:57,872 --> 01:21:59,792
I want my date for my appointment

1286
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:02,884
for my appeal for Employment and Support.

1287
01:22:03,003 --> 01:22:05,213
- Have you not had that yet?
- No.

1288
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:08,261
Please listen to me, Dan.

1289
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:14,851
It's a huge decision to come off JSA
without any other income coming in.

1290
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:18,891
Look, it... It could be weeks before
your appeal comes through.

1291
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:23,517
You see, there's no time limit
for a mandatory reconsideration.

1292
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:25,315
I've got a time limit.

1293
01:22:26,026 --> 01:22:27,896
And you might not win.

1294
01:22:29,863 --> 01:22:32,823
Please, just keep signing on.

1295
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:35,953
Get somebody to help you
with the online job searches.

1296
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:39,997
Otherwise, you could lose everything.

1297
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:44,996
Please don't do this. I've seen it before.

1298
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:49,720
Good people, honest people, on the street.

1299
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,930
Thank you, Ann.

1300
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:57,472
But when you lose your self-respect,
you're done for.

1301
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,441
I'll be seeing you gentlemen later.

1302
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:42,728
Oh, wait until security sees this.

1303
01:24:01,121 --> 01:24:04,211
What's going on here?
What are you fucking playing at?

1304
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:06,956
- Aye-aye. You cannot touch us.
- Well that's clever, in't it?

1305
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:09,995
It's me new art installation.

1306
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:27,019
Eh? Certainly can, lads. Come on.

1307
01:24:28,732 --> 01:24:30,192
Look at this, you got all the technology.

1308
01:24:59,053 --> 01:25:01,563
- Look at this!
- I can't believe it.

1309
01:25:03,057 --> 01:25:05,807
I cannot believe it, man.
What have you done?

1310
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:09,059
This is me new hobby.
Shall I put that on my CV?

1311
01:25:09,606 --> 01:25:11,976
Did you stop, even for a second,

1312
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:14,566
to think about the consequences
of what you've done here?

1313
01:25:14,694 --> 01:25:18,114
All I know, mate,
is if I divvent get my appeal date,

1314
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:21,079
I'll be here every day doing this.

1315
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:23,829
- Unbelievable. Every day?
- Every day.

1316
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:26,158
Tell you what, Ben,
just phone the police. Okay.

1317
01:25:26,581 --> 01:25:28,291
I cannae... Listen, mate,
I cannot believe this now.

1318
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:30,746
This is out of our hands.
We're gonna have to phone the cops, man.

1319
01:25:30,877 --> 01:25:32,917
Well, if youse had done your job
like you should have done,

1320
01:25:33,046 --> 01:25:34,336
I wouldn't have had to resort to this.

1321
01:25:34,464 --> 01:25:36,384
I cannot believe it. I cannot believe it.

1322
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:40,013
Go on, lad, give him a hand.

1323
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:43,098
Yes!

1324
01:25:43,223 --> 01:25:45,233
Words of wisdom!

1325
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:47,313
You're the man, wee man! Eh?

1326
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:49,595
Fucking eh? Yeah!

1327
01:25:52,106 --> 01:25:53,566
Are youse out of work, mate?

1328
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:55,321
Are you fucking... Are you Daniel Blake?

1329
01:25:55,443 --> 01:25:56,493
I am Daniel Blake, yes.

1330
01:25:56,611 --> 01:25:58,201
Hey, this is Daniel Blake!

1331
01:25:58,321 --> 01:26:00,781
Fucking look at that. Yeah!

1332
01:26:00,907 --> 01:26:02,407
Yeah! Hey!

1333
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:08,161
You look fucking freezing, pal.
Here, have my jacket.

1334
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:10,044
- No, no.
- No, come on, man, have my fucking jacket.

1335
01:26:10,124 --> 01:26:12,344
It's all right, son. Look after yoursel', eh?

1336
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,750
Keep yoursel' warm like.

1337
01:26:13,878 --> 01:26:15,049
You're a gentleman.

1338
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:19,972
So what's, what's your appeal all about?

1339
01:26:22,136 --> 01:26:25,056
Liar!

1340
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,561
You're... You're under arrest
on suspicion of criminal damage.

1341
01:26:29,686 --> 01:26:32,056
Hey, a miscarriage of justice, eh.

1342
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:34,936
Slow down. Whoa. Back off.

1343
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:36,070
All right, all right, all right.

1344
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,860
What the fuck's going on? Eh?

1345
01:26:37,986 --> 01:26:41,156
You should be arresting the wankers
who came up with sanctions. Eh?

1346
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:44,330
That preachy baldy cunt. What's his name?

1347
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,950
Ian Duncan fucking what's-his-face.

1348
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:48,867
Aye, and the posh dicks in their mansions

1349
01:26:48,997 --> 01:26:51,077
who came up with the fucking
bedroom tax for disabled...

1350
01:26:51,165 --> 01:26:54,995
Listen, youse are all gonna
be out of a fucking job anyway.

1351
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:58,168
Privatizing you, eh?
All the fucking Tories, man.

1352
01:26:58,298 --> 01:27:01,095
Aye, members of the fucking big club, eh.

1353
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:02,885
Fucking posh Eton twats.

1354
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:08,102
Sir Daniel fucking Blake, pal!

1355
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:11,352
Hey, should be a statue made for you, pal.

1356
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,190
Fucking Sir Daniel Blake!

1357
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:16,611
Yer a fucking beauty!

1358
01:27:20,612 --> 01:27:22,322
Yay!

1359
01:27:27,785 --> 01:27:28,995
So, what happens now?

1360
01:27:29,287 --> 01:27:32,747
Right, this is a copy of the caution sheet.

1361
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:35,129
Because you fully admitted the offences

1362
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:37,209
and you've been of good
character in the past,

1363
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:40,213
we're cautioning you for the offence
of criminal damage,

1364
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:42,760
under Section Five of the Public Order Act.

1365
01:27:43,927 --> 01:27:47,137
But please remember
that these can come back

1366
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:50,141
and haunt you if you re-offend.

1367
01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:52,354
So try to keep yourself out of trouble.

1368
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:56,863
Aye.

1369
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:01,243
- See him out, please.
- This way, Mr Blake.

1370
01:28:43,653 --> 01:28:46,413
Dan. Dan!

1371
01:28:47,824 --> 01:28:49,664
Come, I need to talk to you.

1372
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:53,833
We called you loads of times.

1373
01:29:06,884 --> 01:29:08,014
Dan!

1374
01:29:10,847 --> 01:29:13,017
Mum's been so sad lately.

1375
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,390
Why don't you speak to her?

1376
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:18,020
Don't you have credit on the phone?

1377
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:32,325
I see you.

1378
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:40,329
We understand what happened to your heart.

1379
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:43,047
Mum spoke to one of your neighbours.

1380
01:29:44,756 --> 01:29:46,126
We didn't know about it.

1381
01:29:57,852 --> 01:29:59,102
It's cold out here.

1382
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:02,355
I'm freezing.

1383
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:09,357
Please, Daisy, I'm not feeling very well.

1384
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,163
I made you some couscous.

1385
01:30:13,326 --> 01:30:14,986
And Dylan sent you his lollipop.

1386
01:30:17,997 --> 01:30:19,367
He's really missing you, too.

1387
01:30:22,752 --> 01:30:24,382
Just go, Daisy, please.

1388
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:30,132
Can I ask you one question, Dan?

1389
01:30:32,804 --> 01:30:34,104
Did you help us?

1390
01:30:35,765 --> 01:30:36,965
Suppose so.

1391
01:30:37,183 --> 01:30:38,733
So why can't I help you?

1392
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:48,401
I'm sorry.

1393
01:30:49,946 --> 01:30:51,406
I'm sorry, Daisy.

1394
01:30:53,032 --> 01:30:54,202
I'm really sorry.

1395
01:31:06,546 --> 01:31:10,216
You know, I'm not usually a nervous person,
Katie, but I'm nervous about this.

1396
01:31:10,508 --> 01:31:11,928
It's only natural, Dan.

1397
01:31:12,051 --> 01:31:13,431
I just want it done, you know?

1398
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:16,431
Yeah. Well, you're prepared.
You got all your papers.

1399
01:31:16,514 --> 01:31:18,434
You've got a good,
good person representing you.

1400
01:31:18,766 --> 01:31:21,596
And then when you're done,
you can come, come to dinner to celebrate.

1401
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:23,650
The kids are really looking
forward to seeing you.

1402
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:50,384
Hi, er, Daniel Blake. I've come for my appeal
for the reinstatement of my...

1403
01:31:50,464 --> 01:31:52,474
Employment and Support Allowance.

1404
01:31:57,638 --> 01:31:59,718
- Daniel, hi. Hello. Are you all right?
- Hello.

1405
01:31:59,849 --> 01:32:02,189
- Hi, I'm Katie. I'm a friend of Daniel's.
- Hi.

1406
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:04,650
- You're here for support, yeah?
- Yeah.

1407
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:12,030
Daniel, your appeal will be heard by
a legally qualified chairperson and a doctor.

1408
01:32:12,612 --> 01:32:14,112
- Aye, fingers crossed.
- Yeah...

1409
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:16,738
If I lose this appeal,
I'm out on the streets.

1410
01:32:16,866 --> 01:32:20,826
Well, we've got some updated
reports here from your GP,

1411
01:32:21,078 --> 01:32:23,458
your own consultant and your
physiotherapist.

1412
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:25,211
And they're all furious.

1413
01:32:26,459 --> 01:32:27,709
You're gonna win this, Dan.

1414
01:32:28,502 --> 01:32:30,132
I do this every week.

1415
01:32:32,215 --> 01:32:33,875
- I bet me life on it.
- I told ya.

1416
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:40,473
Just be yourself,
answer the questions and relax.

1417
01:32:40,890 --> 01:32:42,480
I'm really confident.

1418
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:45,521
D'you have any questions?

1419
01:32:46,145 --> 01:32:48,515
Well, I've got one or two things
I'd like to get off me chest.

1420
01:32:49,065 --> 01:32:51,315
- But will they listen?
- It's the least they can do.

1421
01:32:51,651 --> 01:32:52,861
And can I go in with him?

1422
01:32:53,069 --> 01:32:54,448
I'll certainly ask. Would you like her to?

1423
01:32:54,528 --> 01:32:55,698
- Yeah. Definitely, yeah.
- Yeah?

1424
01:32:55,821 --> 01:32:58,281
Okay, I'll certainly ask. No problem at all.

1425
01:32:58,532 --> 01:33:00,122
All right. Thank you.

1426
01:33:00,326 --> 01:33:03,036
My pleasure.
I'll just go and see what the score is.

1427
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:06,537
- Yeah.
- Sounds good, don't it?

1428
01:33:08,459 --> 01:33:09,499
Look at them.

1429
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,970
It's funny, they've got
my life in their hands.

1430
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:21,561
Thanks, Katie, for coming.

1431
01:33:22,515 --> 01:33:23,845
Thank you for asking me.

1432
01:33:24,475 --> 01:33:26,305
You stubborn old bastard.

1433
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:34,491
I think I'll go and freshen up, yeah?

1434
01:33:34,694 --> 01:33:35,744
All right.

1435
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:31,545
Can somebody, er,
phone an ambulance, please? 9-9-9.

1436
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,915
There's a guy collapsed in the toilet.
He's flat out.

1437
01:34:34,045 --> 01:34:36,705
Phone 9-9-9. Somebody, please.

1438
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:38,376
Dan!

1439
01:34:38,549 --> 01:34:40,339
No! Dan!

1440
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,558
Just had a heart attack.
Yeah, two breaths, please.

1441
01:34:44,638 --> 01:34:45,848
Oh, Dan!

1442
01:34:46,223 --> 01:34:49,443
- Just the two breaths...
- Is he breathing?

1443
01:34:49,769 --> 01:34:51,479
Oh, Dan.

1444
01:34:51,604 --> 01:34:52,814
Listen, we're trying to help
him as much as we can.

1445
01:34:52,938 --> 01:34:55,569
No, no, no, please keep going,
please keep going. Don't stop.

1446
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:56,859
I'm afraid we've lost him.

1447
01:34:57,151 --> 01:35:01,661
No, don't say that,
please don't say that. No.

1448
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,236
- No, please!
- I'm so sorry.

1449
01:35:05,368 --> 01:35:06,408
I'm sorry.

1450
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,160
- Please...
- Where's the ambulance now?

1451
01:35:09,497 --> 01:35:11,747
- Please.
- No response at all.

1452
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:19,760
Please. Please try again.

1453
01:36:11,851 --> 01:36:12,891
Erm...

1454
01:36:13,811 --> 01:36:18,901
They call this a "pauper's funeral"
because it's the cheapest slot, at 9:00.

1455
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:22,900
But Dan wasn't a pauper to us.

1456
01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:27,488
He gave us things that money can't buy.

1457
01:36:30,953 --> 01:36:32,753
When he died, I found this on him.

1458
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,503
He always used to write in pencil.

1459
01:36:39,503 --> 01:36:40,553
Erm...

1460
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:45,760
And he wanted to read it at his appeal
but he never got the chance to.

1461
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:51,601
And I swear that this lovely man,

1462
01:36:52,683 --> 01:36:54,063
had so much more to give,

1463
01:36:56,103 --> 01:36:59,323
and that the State drove him
to an early grave.

1464
01:37:03,486 --> 01:37:04,776
And this is what he wrote.

1465
01:37:07,281 --> 01:37:12,371
"I am not a client, a customer,
nor a service user.

1466
01:37:13,913 --> 01:37:18,793
"I am not a shirker, a scrounger,
a beggar, nor a thief.

1467
01:37:19,877 --> 01:37:23,797
"I'm not a National Insurance Number
or blip on a screen.

1468
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:29,220
"I paid my dues, never a penny short,
and proud to do so.

1469
01:37:30,804 --> 01:37:35,774
"I don't tug the forelock, but look my
neighbour in the eye and help him if I can.

1470
01:37:37,019 --> 01:37:39,439
"I don't accept or seek charity.

1471
01:37:41,357 --> 01:37:46,447
"My name is Daniel Blake.
I am a man, not a dog.

1472
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:49,821
"As such, I demand my rights.

1473
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,450
"I demand you treat me with respect.

1474
01:37:55,162 --> 01:37:58,542
"I, Daniel Blake, am a citizen,

1475
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:02,423
"nothing more and nothing less."

1476
01:38:03,671 --> 01:38:04,761
Thank you.
