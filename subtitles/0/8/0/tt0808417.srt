1
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,677
Passport, please.

2
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,553
Madam,
your ticket and your passport.

3
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,436
Marji, stop running!

4
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,756
Look! It's Nioucha over there!

5
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,471
Marji, you've really grown up!

6
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,999
Did you bring me a present?

7
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,077
How is Paris?

8
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,838
And the Eiffel Tower?

9
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,995
Welcome to Teheran.

10
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,155
You're here!

11
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,110
Your luggage.

12
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,594
No, it's me!

13
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,472
Come on! They're waiting for us.

14
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,433
I remember.

15
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,074
Back then,
I had a quiet life.

16
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,872
A little girl's life.

17
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,311
I used to love fries with ketchup
and Bruce Lee,

18
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,512
I was wearing Adidas shoes
and I had 2 obsessions:

19
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,872
to shave my legs and
to become the last prophetess.

20
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,674
If you put a pen under your tits

21
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,440
and it gets stuck then you're
in deep shit.

22
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,272
If we shake this one,

23
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,277
we can fill a box.

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,910
Calm down!

25
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,680
They let me see him last week.

26
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,836
He wasn't a pretty sight.

27
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,271
They told me that they would
release him. It's been 4 years.

28
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,754
Don't worry.

29
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,872
This regime won't last much longer.
There's going to be one heck of a row.

30
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,877
Mom! Marji hurt me!

31
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,355
The dragon's revenge is a
dish best eaten cold!

32
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,790
The dragon is gonna get some.

33
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,195
"I, Marjane, future prophetess,
have decided that:

34
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,312
"One, everybody must have
a good behavior.

35
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,637
"Two, everybody must
preach good words.

36
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,638
"Three, everybody must
do one good deed.

37
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,038
"Four, the poor must be able to
eat one fried chicken everyday.

38
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,312
"Five, no old woman will
suffer ever again."

39
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,590
Marji,
if it's gonna be like that,

40
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,756
I'll be your first disciple.

41
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,552
Really? Great!

42
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,558
How to be sure that
they won't suffer anymore?

43
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,239
It'll be forbidden.

44
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,032
I should have thought about it.

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,559
What's going on?

46
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,718
Death to the shah!
Death to the shah!

47
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,674
I knew it!

48
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,995
I knew it!

49
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,516
This is an historic moment!

50
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,112
He's finally gonna pay.

51
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,232
Yes, daughter.
Your father will be avenged.

52
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,749
The shah will meet his
buddies in Washington.

53
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,793
As for myself,
I think I love the shah.

54
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,392
He's been chosen by God.

55
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,198
Yes! Absolutely!

56
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,154
God himself told me.
The teacher too.

57
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,996
The shah wasn't chosen by God.

58
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,189
Lies!

59
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,879
Shh...

60
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,393
That's what they say.

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,239
I'll tell you how it happened.

62
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,399
Truth is that 50 years ago,
the shah's father, an officer,

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,114
wanted to overthrow the
Qadjar emperor.

64
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,392
I'll do like Ataturk!
I'll modernize the country.

65
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,192
I'll create a republic!

66
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,119
But the English heard about it.

67
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,835
Hello! Why do you want
to create a republic?

68
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,235
You could be emperor!

69
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,953
Me? Emperor?

70
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,596
Of course!
It's better than president.

71
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,791
You'll have full powers.

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,672
A country like yours

73
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,111
needs a strong man like you
to rule it.

74
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,834
Hmm... It's quite true.

75
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,873
And also... you know that
the clergy

76
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,957
is against the republic.

77
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,549
Between us, he's right.

78
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,432
What must I do?

79
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,108
Nothing. You give us the oil.

80
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,273
We'll take care of the rest.

81
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,910
Now, I am the king!
Everything that belong to you is mine.

82
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,712
He was an asshole!

83
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,036
- Oh!
- Yes and no.

84
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,232
He was a dictator,
but he modernized Iran.

85
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,637
He loved his country,
unlike his son, his successor.

86
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,913
I am the king now!
I am the light of the Aryans!

87
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,954
I'll make this country
the most modern of all time!

88
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,628
Our people will shine again!

89
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,554
Yes, the shah's father
has been very hard.

90
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,478
He put your grandpa in prison.

91
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,636
But his son was ten times worse.

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,319
Grandpa has been in prison?

93
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,511
Yes! He was a member of
the royal family.

94
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,838
He was a Qadjar prince. The shah's
father took everything from him.

95
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,077
He went to prison because
he was a communist.

96
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,831
My grandpa was a Qadjar prince
and also a communist!

97
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,635
God damn it! You're still alive.
I was worried.

98
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,479
- They shot on people!
- It was hot.

99
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,956
We escaped but we got caught later.

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,594
Those sons of bitches
took my films.

101
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
- We were at the police station.
- Marji was overexcited.

102
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,030
She was a pain in the neck with the
proletarians, the class struggle

103
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,276
and this bearded man,
"Che Guevero."

104
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,233
The guy who was killed
wasn't even 20 years old.

105
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,634
What is this country?

106
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,637
- It's one hell of a mess, daughter.
- Death to the shah!

107
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,875
Here it goes again!

108
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,072
Death to the shah!
Death to the shah!

109
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,951
Marji!

110
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,798
Go to bed now!

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,028
Death to the shah!
Death to the shah!

112
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,629
I understand your revolt.

113
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,753
We'll try to walk together
towards democracy.

114
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,520
We'll build the future together.

115
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,759
Siamak!

116
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,757
- They released you?
- Hello, Ebi.

117
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,155
It's Siamak!
He's back.

118
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,351
Hello, Tadji.

119
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,869
We're so happy to see you alive!

120
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,479
Come in!

121
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,796
Don't stay in front of the door.

122
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,920
But it's Marjane!
You've grown!

123
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,908
You were still a baby
when I was arrested.

124
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,156
And now you're a young lady.

125
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,028
Who is this guy?

126
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,037
My father. He was in prison.

127
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,992
He's a hero.

128
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,112
Those scientists knew the
human body very well.

129
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,914
They knew how to hit
where it hurts.

130
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,428
I've been lashed with
large electric wire cables.

131
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,632
My foot doesn't look
like a foot anymore.

132
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,436
There are nerves going straight
to the brain under the feet.

133
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,914
It's an indescribable pain.

134
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,193
Our torturers had been
trained by the CIA.

135
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,798
They were at the
forefront of torture.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,560
What about Hamid?
What happened to him?

137
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,317
Hamid has been murdered.

138
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,274
As a member of the guerilla,
it was hell for him.

139
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,277
He has some cyanide with him.

140
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,153
But unfortunately,
he couldn't use it.

141
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,635
So he endured the worst tortures.

142
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,515
The one who loses will be
tortured to the death.

143
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,029
- Cool!
- What kind of torture?

144
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,471
He will be lashed with
the electric wire cable!

145
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,479
But first, he'll have to put
that in his mouth.

146
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,999
And chew three times.

147
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,839
Yeah!

148
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,759
Look, it's Ramine!

149
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,589
Farzad told me that his father was a
member of the shah's secret service.

150
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,918
His father killed a million of
people with his own hands!

151
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,235
A million!?

152
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,793
Absolutely.

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,880
We'll give Ramine a lesson
in their name.

154
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,152
Yeah! We'll gouge his eyes out!

155
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,879
Marjane!

156
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,308
What are you doing?

157
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,990
- Marji found some nails.
- We're gonna smash Ramine's face.

158
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,519
Would you like it if
I nailed you by the ears?

159
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,909
Go back home into your room
and stay there.

160
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,395
Marjane, what's happening to you?

161
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,319
It's not a behavior worthy
of a prophetess.

162
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,751
But God,
Ramine's father killed people!

163
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,714
Marjane, this poor Ramine
must not bear the burden

164
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,592
of his father's mistakes.

165
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,873
Bad guys will pay sooner or later.
Have faith in my justice.

166
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,471
Your duty is to forgive,
not to make justice.

167
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,836
Ramine?

168
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,075
What do you want?

169
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,955
Listen, your father is a murderer,
but it's not your fault.

170
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,309
I forgive you.

171
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,394
He killed communists,
and communists are the devil!

172
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,670
The country was euphoric

173
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,552
during the months following
the shah's departure.

174
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,514
Everybody had been a revolutionary
and had fought the shah.

175
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,711
The wine stain of our neighbour

176
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,832
had changed into a war wound.

177
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,679
Our teacher, admirer of the shah,

178
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,668
ordered us to tear off all the
pictures of the royal family.

179
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,475
Political meetings were increasing
and yesterday's enemies

180
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,399
had become heroes of the nation.

181
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,434
It's in this climate that, one night,
uncle Anouche appeared in my life.

182
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,111
Now, everything will be better.
Nothing will stop the people.

183
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,279
We'll finally have a free
and fair society.

184
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,597
Proletariat will rule
as Lenin predicted.

185
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,550
Uncle Anouche?

186
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,512
How long did you stay in prison?

187
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,675
Nine years.

188
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,438
Longer tha Laly's father?

189
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,392
How old are you?
Are you a communist?

190
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,717
Marji, let your uncle digest!

191
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,558
She wants to know everything.

192
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,910
It's a good thing to be curious.

193
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,473
Have you digested?

194
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,556
Go to bed!

195
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,954
But!

196
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,199
Put your pajamas on and I'll come.

197
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,508
Did you see?
They're preparing the elections.

198
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,392
People will want
to keep their freedom

199
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,319
after this dictatorship.

200
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,193
It will never be worse
than under the shah.

201
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,436
I'm ready!

202
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,359
You'll see,
she'll eat your brain.

203
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,516
I'm ready!!

204
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,870
I'll start with the beginning.

205
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,072
I was 18 years old when
my uncle and my friends

206
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,431
declared the independence of
Azerbaidjan's Iranian province.

207
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,755
Wow!

208
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,351
Fereydoun appointed himself as
minister of Justice of this republic.

209
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,956
Justice is the basis of democracy.

210
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,197
Men must be equal
in front of the law.

211
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,960
I became his secretary.

212
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,039
It's just a beginning.
We'll free Iran from dictatorship.

213
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,549
Province by province,
city by city.

214
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,113
I'm sure of it!

215
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,359
It wasn't easy for me because
my father was loyal to the shah.

216
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,993
My son is a traitor!
Go and meet your stupid brother!

217
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,510
You'll all be shot!
Shot!

218
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,759
My father couldn't have been
more right. One morning...

219
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,518
My God! Fereydoun!

220
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,995
I had to escape.
I had no choice.

221
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,158
While my uncle was facing
his destiny alone...

222
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,231
I walked for days in the storm.

223
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,477
I was hungry, I was cold,
but I kept going.

224
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,837
I crossed Alborz mountains
to take refuge at my parents home,

225
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,598
in Astara.

226
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,709
Who dares bother me at this hour?

227
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,070
My God, Anouche!
My God!

228
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,918
It's our son, he's almost dead.

229
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,348
My dear son!

230
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,479
My son...

231
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,433
My dear son, forgive me!

232
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,518
I couldn't stay, I was wanted.

233
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,438
I had to go into exile.

234
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,470
I swam across the Aras river
and I arrived in USSR.

235
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,319
What did you do then?

236
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,112
I went to Leningrad.

237
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,949
Then to Moscow, I got my doctorate
in Marxism-Leninism.

238
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,276
But I was missing my family.

239
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,076
I tried to came back by train
with forged identity papers
but it didn't work.

240
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,033
- They arrested me.
- Then you went to prison?

241
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,231
Yes. You know...

242
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,635
It's important that you know.

243
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,877
The memory of the family
must not be forgotten.

244
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,390
Even if it's hard,
even if you don't understand everything.

245
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,275
Don't worry, uncle Anouche.
I'll never forget.

246
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,072
Were you married in Russia?

247
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,998
It's late. You must sleep.

248
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,997
Here, it's for you.

249
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,631
I made it in prison.

250
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,918
It's made of breadcrumbs.

251
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,039
99,99% of the people
voted democratically

252
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,151
for the islamic republic.

253
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,194
It's normal. Each revolution
has its transition period.

254
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,311
Half the country is illiterate.

255
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,196
Only nationalism or religious
ethics rally people.

256
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,596
Mina left the country.
She thinks it's too dangerous.

257
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,520
We found Mohsen drowned
in the bath tube.

258
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,954
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

259
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,553
Siamak and his family left.
Those bastards killed his sister.

260
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,029
Maybe we should leave too.

261
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,550
You could be a cleaning lady
and me, a taxi driver.

262
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,113
We'll get rid of the
antirevolutionaries.

263
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,630
Between them and us, there's only
one law, the law of blood.

264
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,877
- Marji?
- Yes?

265
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,871
They arrested Anouche.

266
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,274
I know.

267
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,513
- Daddy!
- It will be all right, honey.

268
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,234
Do you want to do
something for him?

269
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,194
Anouche can have one visitor.
You're the one she wants to see.

270
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,795
I'll go.

271
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,028
Ten minutes.

272
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,994
What a nice dress!

273
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,631
What a nice little girl!

274
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,634
Your visit honours me.

275
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,878
You're the little girl
I wish I would have had.

276
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,992
But you'll see, one day,
proletariat will rule

277
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,110
Here.

278
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,274
I made another cygnus with
breadcrumbs for you.

279
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,516
It's the uncle of the first one.

280
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,556
Star of my life.

281
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,196
What's up my child?
Don't be sad.

282
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,949
Shut the fuck up!
They killed him and you did nothing!

283
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,957
I've nothing to do with it...

284
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,276
Shut up!
I don't want to see you again!

285
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,471
Go away! Go away!

286
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,718
Get lost!!!

287
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,268
One year after the revolution,
Iraq attacked Iran.

288
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,711
Saddam took advantage of the
country's weakness to strike.

289
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,319
The revolution and the army
massive cleansings had weakened us.

290
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,159
In the name of the fight
against the foreign enemy,

291
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,555
the state wiped out
the enemy inland,

292
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,399
the old opponents to
the shah's government.

293
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,351
Arrests and executions increased.

294
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,551
Everybody was scared.

295
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,958
The new government established
even more repressive laws.

296
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,358
Within two years,
our everyday life changed.

297
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,959
And so did we.

298
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,309
Come on!

299
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,636
On the heart for our martyrs!

300
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,512
Sons and daughters of Iran,

301
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,439
war killed our best children.

302
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,837
Truth will soon arise
from their blood.

303
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,598
Who did they die for?

304
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,916
It's for us.

305
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,758
It's for us!

306
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,590
Hey! Martyrs!

307
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,870
Martyrs! Martyrs!

308
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,399
Finish me off!

309
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,318
Satrapi, what are you doing?

310
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,715
I'm suffering, isn't it obvious?

311
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,717
Go to the class immediately!

312
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,911
The veil is synonymous with freedom.
A worthy woman must cover herself

313
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,193
from the eyes of men.
The one revealing herself is a sinner.

314
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,517
- She'll burn in hell.
- Hey! Did you see that?

315
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,836
- Wow!
- Our soldiers are dying

316
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,678
for our country...
- Hey!

317
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,874
Look!

318
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,878
-Pfff! Abba,
it's for the simple minded!

319
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,788
Go outside in close order!
Come on!

320
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,631
Mom, what do we eat?

321
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,671
What about some chili?

322
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,677
Yes, so we can fart!

323
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,669
Give me that!

324
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,348
- I saw it first!
- Yeah right, bitch!

325
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,356
Stop!

326
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,154
That's how it is as soon
as a shop is empty!

327
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,430
Each must take according
to their needs.

328
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,599
What business is it of yours?

329
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,755
Shut up!

330
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,998
Put your scarf back on.

331
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,433
Hey! I'm talking to you!

332
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,517
Don't get too familiar.

333
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,518
Show some respect.

334
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,675
Respect?

335
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,359
Women like you,

336
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,630
I fuck them against the walls!

337
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,556
Get in!

338
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,789
Mom, are you all right?

339
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,230
Yes, darling.
I'm fine.

340
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,839
Are you moving or what?

341
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,390
Shut the hell up!

342
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,395
Mom, give me 50 tomans!

343
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,318
What for?

344
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,669
To buy a tape.

345
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,952
What about your Bee Gees tapes?

346
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,878
The Bee Gees suck!

347
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,279
Stevie Wonder.
Julio Iglesias.

348
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,879
Pink Floyd.

349
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,274
"Jichael Mackson."

350
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,195
Lipstick, nail polish, cards.

351
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,753
Iron Maiden.

352
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,278
- How much?
- 100.

353
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,549
- 50.
- 60.

354
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,988
- 50.
- 60.

355
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,189
- 50.
- 50.

356
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,831
What the hell is this outfit?

357
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,314
Punk shoes!

358
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,635
Which ones?

359
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,431
Those.

360
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,834
They're sneakers.

361
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,234
It's punk.

362
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,795
I play basketball at school.

363
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,319
And this jacket?

364
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,589
And that?

365
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,869
Michael Jackson!

366
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,798
A symbol of decadence!

367
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,753
Not at all, madam.
It's... It's...

368
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,916
- Malcolm X.
- Are you kidding me?

369
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,951
Lower your scarf, you little whore!

370
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,311
- Follow us to the committee.
- Sorry, madam.

371
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,195
My mother is dead. My evil
mother-in-law is taking care of me.

372
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,996
She'll kill if I don't go back home.
She'll burn me with the iron.

373
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,034
She'll force my father to
put me in an orphanage.

374
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,391
Have mercy!
Please, madam. Mercy...

375
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,431
Mercy. Have mercy, madam...

376
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,479
Phew!

377
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,278
Our soldiers bravery bore fruit.

378
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,349
Tonight, our army destroyed 63 tanks
and 26 Iraqi fighters.

379
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,678
The blood of our martyrs is
irrigating our sacred land.

380
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,519
Deserts of despair
will blossom from it.

381
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,589
Dying as a martyr is like injecting
blood in the veins of society.

382
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,519
Are you all right, Mrs Nassrine?

383
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,429
No, I'm not.
They gave that to my son at school.

384
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,234
They told them that if they
died in combat

385
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,273
they would go to
heaven with this key!

386
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,391
They've been told that in heaven,

387
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,036
there's plenty of food and women...

388
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,070
Women?!

389
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,233
Well, yes...
He's 14 yers old, he's interested.

390
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,953
I suffered a lot.

391
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,594
I raised my 5 children
with my tears.

392
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,076
Now they want to take my elder
son for this key.

393
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,714
I've always been
faithful to religion.

394
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,673
I prayed, wore a veil and obeyed.

395
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,597
If that's how things are then
I don't want to believe in anything.

396
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,755
It's me!

397
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,234
They arrested the Rochanis.

398
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,537
They found some alcohol
at their home.

399
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,118
Who are you covering yourself for?

400
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,228
For mister.

401
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,113
That's how we've been raised.

402
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,508
Don't worry.

403
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,358
I'll talk to your son.

404
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,719
Thanks to my parents,

405
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,832
Mrs Nassrine's son didn't
go up to the front.

406
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,839
Between the fear of the bombings,
the government repression,

407
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,158
and the spying of the neighbours,
life was taking its course.

408
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,156
To make things bearable,

409
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,239
people were partying in secret.

410
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,796
People were getting drunk at
the parties. Alcohol was forbidden,

411
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,389
so my uncle was providing
the family with wine.

412
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,398
He has installed a wine production
laboratory in his cellar.

413
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,751
Mrs Nassrine,
my uncle's cleaning lady

414
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,313
was pressing the grapes.

415
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,238
May God forgive me!

416
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,830
Going to these
parties was dangerous

417
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,271
but it was our only
little moment of freedom.

418
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,035
Come on! Get out!

419
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,356
Identity papers,
driver licence.

420
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,239
Ok, ok.

421
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,714
Come closer.

422
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,992
Blow.
You drank.

423
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,950
No.

424
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,071
You're lying, you dirty westerner!

425
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,110
That's enough!

426
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,153
How dare you talk to me like that?

427
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,229
Shut up!

428
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,509
Listen.

429
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,756
I could be your mother.

430
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,269
How old are you?
My daughter is 13.

431
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,074
You'd be in hell without your wife.

432
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,554
Thank you!

433
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,398
Get in! We're going to your place

434
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,431
to check if there are some bottles.

435
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,878
Grandma, Marji, you go first.

436
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,071
Empty all the bottles.

437
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,510
- But how?
- Don't worry, my daughter.

438
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,551
I was used to it with your father.

439
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,069
We had to hide the flyers.

440
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,198
Listen, the neighbour on the same
floor is a bit old.

441
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,709
He has a heart condition.
He could die

442
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,912
if we make too much noise.
Can we come to an agreement?

443
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,158
Hey! Where are you going?

444
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,876
I'm diabetic, son.
I have to drink some syrup.

445
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,310
Diabetic?
Like my mother.

446
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,475
Go ahead.

447
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,117
Where are the others?

448
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,472
Their arrogance isn't ideological.
A few bills were enough.

449
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,870
Tell me,
did you throw everything away?

450
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,629
Well, yes!

451
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,239
Shit!

452
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,115
It's his heart again.

453
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,914
They wanted to stop the communists.

454
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,635
They threw a grenade.
Taher couldn't endure it.

455
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,513
He was lying on the ground
when I arrived.

456
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,153
Everything will be all right.

457
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,998
No, it won't.

458
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,998
He must have an
open-heart operation.

459
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,760
They can't afford it here.

460
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,428
He must be sent to England.

461
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,996
I went to see the administrative
director of the hospital.

462
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,953
It's unbelievable.
Do you know who he was?

463
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,594
My old window cleaner.

464
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,793
I pretended not to recognize
this moron.

465
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,959
Only people who are seriously ill
can leave the country.

466
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,310
My husband had three heart attacks.

467
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,114
He must be operated or he'll die.

468
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,072
We'll do our best.

469
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,034
If God wants it, he'll get better.
Everything depends on God.

470
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,109
I need your authorization
for his passport.

471
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,197
If God wants it.

472
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,738
This asshole grew a beard
and wears a suit.

473
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,312
And now he's a director!

474
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,351
My husband's fate depends on

475
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,993
a window cleaner!

476
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,919
He doesn't watch women in
the eyes anymore.

477
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,155
Fucking asshole!

478
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,674
I know someone who
is making passports.

479
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,518
Calm down.
It'll be all right.

480
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,598
Wait!
I'm coming with you.

481
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,678
Where did I put it?

482
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,108
Ha! Here it is!

483
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,196
Look at that.

484
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,549
It looks like a real one.

485
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,318
A month work,
just for this stamp!

486
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,033
What's your name?

487
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,151
How much time do you need?

488
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,309
Passports are very much in demand.

489
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,239
I make a living with that.
They closed my publishing business.

490
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,716
It takes 15 days,
but I'll do it in a week.

491
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,592
Great. Be quick.

492
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,919
It's Niloufar.

493
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,235
This is Ebi,

494
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,273
Anouche's brother,
I talked to you about him.

495
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,310
Hello.

496
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,078
She is a communist too.

497
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,750
Her brother was my messenger.
I'm hiding her in my cellar.

498
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,599
It's the only place
where she's safe.

499
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,356
Is he stupid or what?

500
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,471
He's gonna get crushed!

501
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,274
Here! That's what I said!

502
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,149
Don't look.

503
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,633
- It's too ugly.
- Stop!

504
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,551
What of piece of shit! Apart
from cutting their stomach open

505
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,196
and making disgusting monsters,
those Japanese can't do anything.

506
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,038
Grandma, do you think that
uncle Taher is gonna die?

507
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,196
- Of course.
- Really? You think so?

508
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,075
If he doesn't find any passport
to leave, he won't make it.

509
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,791
He shouldn't have smoked so much.

510
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,594
What a load of crap!
His heart is sick

511
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,554
because his children are far away.

512
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,469
A hot beans pastry boat please.

513
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,558
Children always leave
sooner or later.

514
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,833
But being separated from your 13 years
old children because of war is absurd!

515
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,996
It can break you heart for sure.

516
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,074
I'd be dead already if I was him.

517
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,030
May God exterminate those barbarians.

518
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,912
May God hear you.

519
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,474
Hello? Ha, Khosrow, is that you?

520
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,113
So, what's up?

521
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,357
They arrested Niloufar.
I have to escape!

522
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,709
Hello?

523
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,875
Khosrow?

524
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,235
Hello?

525
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,591
Niloufar was executed.

526
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,032
Khosrow escape by the mountains
in Turkey and went to Sweden.

527
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,478
Uncle Taher was buried
three weeks after these events.

528
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,671
The war intensified.

529
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,358
Let me pass!

530
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,788
Sorry!

531
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,274
Let me pass!

532
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,469
Stop!

533
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,279
I live over there!

534
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,949
Go.

535
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,476
- Marji!
- Mom!

536
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,029
Are you all right?

537
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,992
Yes, honey.
I'm fine.

538
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,997
Where did the missile go?

539
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,196
It hit the Baba Levys.

540
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,550
What? The Baba Levys?

541
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,671
Thanks to the government, we don't
have any political prisoner left.

542
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,949
Madam?

543
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,594
We finally earned our freedom.

544
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,597
- Madam?
- What?

545
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,952
It's the new government that ordered
the execution of my uncle.

546
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,075
From 3000 prisoners during the shah,
we now have 300 000 with you.

547
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,475
How dare you lie?

548
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,750
Stop it!

549
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,510
Who was it?

550
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,110
The school. Marji put the religion
teacher to her place.

551
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,753
- Again?
- Yes.

552
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,393
She takes after her uncle.

553
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,990
Do you want her to end like
her uncle, executed?

554
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,954
Do you know what they do to
young women like Niloufar?

555
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,276
The law forbids to kill a virgin.

556
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,436
She's forced to marry a
Guardian of the Revolution.

557
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,312
Then he takes her virginity
and executes her.

558
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,192
Do you understand?

559
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,837
If someone touches one of her
hair, I'll kill him!

560
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,033
A little later, they decided
to send me abroad.

561
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,437
Since I had studied at
the French school in Teheran,

562
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,236
I'd go to the French school in Vienna.
My father managed to get me a visa.

563
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,910
My mother's best friend
was supposed to take me in.

564
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,749
The day before my departure,
grandma came to sleep at home.

565
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,431
Every morning she put jasmine
flowers in her bra.

566
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,110
When she was taking it off, the
flowers were falling from her tits.

567
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,514
It was magic.

568
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,034
How do you manage to have
such round tits at your age?

569
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,836
Everyday I put them for 10 minutes
in an icy water bowl.

570
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,473
I'll miss you.

571
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,551
I'll come and see you.

572
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,594
Listen.

573
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,237
I'm gonna give you an advice
that will always be useful.

574
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,713
In your life, you'll meet
a lot of assholes.

575
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,072
Remember that it's stupidity
that pushes them to be evil.

576
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,999
It will prevent you from
answering to their nastiness.

577
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,988
Because there's nothing worse
than bitterness and vengeance.

578
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,034
Always remain worthy and
true to yourself.

579
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,915
You'll see,
everything will be all right.

580
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,829
No tears.
Think about your future.

581
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,598
Europe is opening to you.

582
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,792
When you'll arrive in Vienna,
eat a sachertorte.

583
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,515
It's a delicious chocolate cake.
We'll come to see you.

584
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,756
You're a grown up.
No tears!

585
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,913
- Daddy...
- Enough.

586
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,314
You must leave.

587
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,192
Never forget who you are
and where you're coming from.

588
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,799
My daughter.

589
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,997
- Mom!
- My little Marji.

590
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,628
Europe opened itself to me,
but not like I imagined.

591
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,434
After a few days at
my mother's friend home,

592
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,758
she decided that their apartment
was too small to accomodate me.

593
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,589
She found me a bed and board
where I would be very well

594
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,714
according to her.

595
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,911
What?

596
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,711
- Was?

597
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,511
- Huh?

598
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,232
I was finding

599
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,194
shelves of products that
no longer existed in my country.

600
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,998
For a while,

601
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,237
going to the supermarket
was my favorite pastime...

602
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,032
favorite pastime...

603
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,310
favorite pastime...

604
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,592
Anyway! It was urgent that
I make some new friends.

605
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,997
At the French school,
I could understand the others

606
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,838
and be understood.

607
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,235
Do you have a smoke?

608
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,997
Quickly, the school dropouts
were interested in me.

609
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,397
There was Momo, Thierry,
Olivier and Eve.

610
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,273
My nationality and my history
were fascinating them.

611
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,755
You saw a revolution and a war?

612
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,349
- Yeah.
- Did you see many dead people?

613
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,959
- Err... A few.

614
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,434
Wow!

615
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,959
Terrific.

616
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,111
I was soon a member of the band.

617
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,675
With Momo,
I discovered nonchalance,

618
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,919
a forced nihilism concept and
the alternative Vienna life.

619
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,718
I admit that at the beginning
it was a little difficult.

620
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,556
And after all, why not?

621
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,678
I was trying to convince myself
that I had found my place.

622
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,630
But I remained different.

623
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,718
Holidays were sure
to remind me of it.

624
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,319
Shit, Christmas again!
I'll have to see my whole family.

625
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,557
All this because of
an American invention.

626
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,990
Santa Claus is in red and white...

627
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,589
It was a Coca-Cola mascot.

628
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,360
I'll be bored to death in Monte-Carlo.

629
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,312
Monte-Carlo is still all right.

630
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,637
Me, I'm gonna see my father in Brazil,
what a load of crap!

631
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,478
It's at least a 13 hours flight!

632
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,478
Holidays are scraps left to the pleb.

633
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,309
If the anarchists had won,
we wouldn't work anymore.

634
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,590
Is everything all right, my dear?

635
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,714
It's fine.
What are you doing for Christmas?

636
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,796
So?

637
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,151
She'll be with some friends
from shool. Be careful.

638
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,032
Is there anything you need?

639
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,474
You're right, enjoy it.
Kisses.

640
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,875
Eat some frutis and vegetables.

641
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,319
Is it a common behavior?

642
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,509
What?

643
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,439
- The way you're eating?
- We can eat in front of TV.

644
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,473
Maybe, but not in a saucepan.

645
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,596
So it's true,
Iranians have no education.

646
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,357
Is it true that you were
all prostitutes?

647
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,436
Oh!

648
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,113
It was the beginning of
a series of moves.

649
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,311
I was flying from
apartment to apartment.

650
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,988
Eve and her mother took me in.

651
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,555
After that I was living
with 8 homosexuals.

652
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,230
Next, I was living in a maid room
then at some friends home,

653
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,396
and at some friends of
some friends home,

654
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,070
to finally end in
Frau Doktor Schloss villa.

655
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,079
She was a retired
philosophy teacher.

656
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,396
To sum up, she was nuts.

657
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,269
The rent is 2000 schillings a month.

658
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,553
- You like dogs, don't you?
- Yes, yes. I love them.

659
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,678
Yuki adopted you.

660
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,155
Dogs have a sixth sense.

661
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,635
They recognize good people.

662
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,630
I decided to become integrated
during the next year.

663
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,753
But sometimes, western culture
remained a mistery.

664
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,154
Ja voll! Ja voll!

665
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,032
I had to improve my knowledge.

666
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,913
From Sartre to Bakounin,
from Zweig to Freud,..

667
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,076
I read everything I could.

668
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,353
But I understood that some things
would be beyond me forever.

669
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,036
Did you see?
This fat pig Waldheim has been elected.

670
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,595
I want to puke!

671
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,234
It can't last any longer.
We must demonstrate!

672
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,317
All of this is hot air.

673
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,555
Life is empty.

674
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,716
When man realizes it,

675
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,639
he creates games for ruler and...

676
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,638
Bullshit!
Life isn't absurd!

677
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,559
People give their life for freedom!

678
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,716
My uncle didn't die for fun.

679
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,155
Fucking asshole!

680
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,996
My feeling of disarray was immense.

681
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,156
I was safe here while my kins
were enduring the war.

682
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,749
I couldn't let go this
feeling of guilt.

683
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,352
I wanted to live like
a girl of my age.

684
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,310
The time of change was coming.

685
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,353
Within a few months,
I became a young woman.

686
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,518
It was a time of endlessly
repeating ugliness.

687
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,474
First, I grew 18 cm.
Then my face changed.

688
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,753
My face got longer, my right eye
got bigger, followed by my chin.

689
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,316
My right hand became huge,
then it was my left foot.

690
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,392
My nose got three time bigger.
My breast grew.

691
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,709
My buttocks appeared,
restoring my centre of gravity.

692
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,356
And to finish, a huge mole
appeared on my nose.

693
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,553
You see, Yuki? I told you.
She's a whore!

694
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,038
What a shitty music!

695
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,913
There are only assholes here.

696
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,318
Bakounin wanted the socialist
resolutions to be voted.

697
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,192
We wouldn't be where we are.

698
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,276
Really?

699
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,278
Capitalism is eating away
our society, don't you see?

700
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,758
Yeah, of course. Well...
Where are you from... Marie-Jeanne?

701
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,157
Yeah... I'm from...
I'm French.

702
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,353
Ha? I wouldn't have guessed.
Last year I was in Paris.

703
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,551
Excuse me, I must go.

704
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,671
Okay. Well then, bye.

705
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,275
So you're French?

706
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,232
Grandma, stop it.

707
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,317
It was just a question.

708
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,988
I didn't know you were French.

709
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,760
Do you think it's easy to be Iranian?

710
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,554
People are looking at me
as if I was a savage.

711
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,639
We're just fanatics screaming
and fighting each other.

712
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,400
Is it a reason to disown your origin?

713
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,516
Remember what I told you.

714
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,788
Be true to yourself.

715
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,517
Do you know what she told my brother?

716
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,039
That she was French.

717
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,951
- I'm not kidding.
- Did he believe her?

718
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,435
What? Did you see her face?

719
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,634
- He wanted to chat her up?
- Don't be ridiculous!

720
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,638
I'd kill myself if
he went out with this ugly ducking.

721
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,273
Shut the fuck up!

722
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,392
I'm Iranian and proud to be!

723
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,276
After 3 years in Austria
I was finally feeling good.

724
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,995
Momo, Thierry, Eve and Olivier
had left school.

725
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,237
I had new friends.

726
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,830
There was Birgit, a 30 years old
hippy with the face of an old child.

727
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,832
She had a house in the forest
where she was having parties.

728
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,828
The State could rest easy.
Those so-called anarchist meetings

729
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,953
were just a pretext to drink
beer and eat sausages.

730
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,838
I met Fernando at one
of these parties.

731
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,998
When I saw him, I immediately knew
that he was the man of my life.

732
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,396
Marjane, are you here?

733
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,030
Ha!

734
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,629
That night, I finally understood,
thanks to you.

735
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,628
You revealed me to myself.

736
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,676
If it doesn't work with you,
it won't work with any girl.

737
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,838
I know it, now.
I am homosexual.

738
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,956
Ha! It's good to tell it.

739
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,472
Thank you, Marjane. Thank you.

740
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,355
You're welcome.

741
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,037
I swore that I wouldn't let
myself be caught at it again.

742
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,117
I won't let myself
be caught at it again!

743
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,194
Love is a conventional feeling!

744
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,595
But "Life is life",
as the other losers sang it.

745
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,191
One morning in november,
Markus came into my life.

746
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,999
Shall I walk you back?

747
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,991
I had finally found love.

748
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,476
Nothing was frightening me.
The future looked radiant.

749
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,634
Markus was to become a great writer.

750
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,149
He was reading me extracts from
his piece in his room.

751
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,318
We were as one.

752
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,432
I bought some croissants!

753
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,633
Oh!

754
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,354
Wait.
It's not what you think.

755
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,151
Marjane, I love you!

756
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,390
I love you!

757
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,757
I can't find my brooch.

758
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,349
It's you who stole it!

759
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,278
Leave me alone.

760
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,675
I shan't let it rest at that!

761
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,199
Fucking thief!

762
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,152
Go to hell!
I hate you!

763
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,430
You and your fucking dog!!!

764
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,156
Don't talk like that about my dog.
Where are you going?

765
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,515
- You won't get on with it so easily.
- Fuck off!!!

766
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,109
Fucking thief!
Give me my brooch back!

767
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,437
I'll call the police!
Come back!

768
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,596
How could I be so stupid?
This bastard got round me.

769
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,234
I'm a stupid cunt, cunt, cunt!

770
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,479
How could I fall in love with
this scumbag, this skinflint?

771
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,272
Shall I take you back?

772
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,597
I must fill it up.
Do we split 50-50?

773
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,717
This asshole's mouth smelled
like shit with his damned nature!

774
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,150
Fuck! What a stupid cunt are you?

775
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,793
My eye hurts like hell!

776
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,116
- Show me, my love.
- No!

777
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,311
Asshole!
Writer, my ass!

778
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,954
With his shitty piece!
It sucked!

779
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,510
This son of a bitch had no balls.
He didn't take my defense
in front of his mother.

780
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,835
Ja, Mutter.

781
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,792
A gutless individual, yes!

782
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,389
And it was always me
who was buying the junk!

783
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,398
This jerk was waiting
for me in the car.

784
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,512
He wouldn't have been bothered
if I had been arrested.

785
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,794
What a stupid cunt I was!
A stupid cunt!

786
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,232
It was my first night in the street.
The first of many.

787
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,551
I had lost some of my relatives
in a revolution.

788
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,276
I had survived a war.

789
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,150
And it's a love story that
almost got me.

790
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,875
How goes it?

791
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,278
You're waking up?

792
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,034
Well, that was a close one!

793
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,677
It's a good thing we found you.
You've had several bronchitis.

794
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,793
I strictly forbid you
to smoke any cigarette.

795
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,752
- Last name?
- Satrapi.

796
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,871
- First name?
- Marjane.

797
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,076
- Where do you live?
- In Iran.

798
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,190
In Iran?

799
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,152
Can I make a phone call?

800
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,117
Hello?

801
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,794
- Daddy?
- Marjane! Is that you?

802
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,276
We were worried to death
for the last 2 months!

803
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,835
Daddy... Can I come back?

804
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,350
- Of course.
- You won't ask me any question?

805
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,471
No, I promise you.

806
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,958
I'm putting you through to your mother.

807
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,596
- Marjane?
- Mom, please, don't cry.

808
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,553
Come back home.
We're waiting for you.

809
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,274
- Mom...
- We won't ask you any question.

810
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,629
It's a promise.

811
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,796
Don't you have anything forbidden?

812
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,790
Pork, alcohol, cards, music,
film, fashion, porno?

813
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,433
No, sir.

814
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,438
Arrange your veil.

815
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,349
Yes, sir.

816
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,268
You can go.

817
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,598
It's Marji!

818
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,519
- My daughter...
- I didn't recognize you.

819
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,358
- You're here.
- You've grown.

820
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,595
You're here.

821
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,835
I saw the Alborz mountains again.
It had been snowing.

822
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,113
My father was wondering if he had
to put the snow chains on his car.

823
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:11,472
We took the breakfast together,
as before.

824
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,911
My mother had prepared
my favorite omelette.

825
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,157
Nothing had changed,
and yet, I knew that...

826
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:22,558
nothing would be like before.
We talked about many things.

827
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,594
My parents kept their word
and didn't ask me any question.

828
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,669
I didn't feel very comfortable
but I thought that the nightmare
was behind us.

829
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,714
The future might get brighter
once the war will be over.

830
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,992
The war is over for sure.

831
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,033
but people forgot why
there's been 8 years of war.

832
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,708
Let her breath.

833
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,989
She's coming!

834
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,111
No, no, mom.
It's all right.

835
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,549
The West sold weapons
to both sides.

836
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,719
We had been stupid enough
to enter this cynical game.

837
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,115
8 years of war for nothing.

838
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,949
A million dead for nothing.

839
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,468
The last days had been horrifying.

840
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,035
A month before the armistice,
Irak bombed Teheran on a daily basis.

841
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,596
As if it had to be wiped
out from the map.

842
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,756
Just before the ceasefire,

843
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,431
the government got scared because
some opponents had fled to Iran.

844
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,278
The government was afraid of
the threat that represented
the thousands of political prisoners.

845
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,439
So the state decided to put
an end to it the hard way.

846
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,835
They proposed to the convicts

847
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,716
to renounce their ideals, to promise
to be loyal to the regime

848
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,275
and to serve their sentence

849
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,436
or to be executed.

850
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,311
Most of them were executed.

851
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,749
That's it.

852
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,633
Now streets are
named after martyrs.

853
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,355
That's all that's left to famillies.
Street names.

854
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,356
When you walk in Teheran,

855
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,279
it's like being in a cemetery.

856
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,432
You've really grown!

857
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,995
You'll soon be able to
catch the balls of the Lord.

858
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,553
Grandma!

859
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,631
Tell me.

860
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,114
How was Vienna?

861
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,198
Well, yeah...
It was different.

862
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,432
Do you remember Mina?

863
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,517
Of course, she's my cousin.

864
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,280
she got married.
She has two kids.

865
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,554
She's still as stupid as before.

866
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,591
And Shila, do you remember her?

867
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,358
- Yes .
- She's ugly.

868
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,439
She has hair on her face.
She looks like a gorilla.

869
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,153
And do you remember Mojdeh?

870
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,157
I remember everybody.

871
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,874
She got a divorce.
He had a small dick.

872
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,198
Well, that's what Shahri said.
She told Mehri who told me.

873
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,357
You'll see them all soon.

874
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,155
Oh no!

875
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,475
Well, yes...

876
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,673
You must be speaking German now.

877
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,710
Yes, a little.

878
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,388
I know how to say
"Ich liebe dich."

879
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,472
Vienna reminds me of
Empress Sissi.

880
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,795
You saw Romy Schneider?

881
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,759
Marjane...
Stars are shining in the sky

882
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,439
and you in my heart.

883
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,476
What a nun face! It's doesn't
look like you lived in Europe.

884
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,635
Really?

885
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,070
Talk a little!
Tell us.

886
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,554
I don't know...

887
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,399
How are the night clubs in Vienna?

888
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,478
Well... I didn't go out much.

889
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,591
- I don't like night clubs too much.
- What?!

890
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,313
Did you have sex?

891
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,316
Well, yes.

892
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,509
Is it good?

893
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,516
It depends.

894
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,439
What?
You had sex with several men?

895
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,189
- Join a nursery school.
- Have your nose fixed.

896
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,435
I can't bear it anymore!
It's 40C!

897
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,914
I can't stand it any longer.

898
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,951
Damn hairdresser!

899
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,993
- You're not worthy of my son!
- Oh! Anahita!

900
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,269
Hello!

901
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,912
Marjane just went out.

902
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,758
All right, I'll tell her.

903
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,518
Good bye.

904
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,599
Stop watching tv!
Didn't you want to try the exam?

905
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,837
You're ruining the
best years of your life.

906
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,758
Go and meet people!

907
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,712
Everybody is pissing me off.

908
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,876
Out of 7 million inhabitants,

909
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,833
isn't there one person who
you don't think is stupid?

910
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,989
There was Kia, my childhood friend,
I wanted to see him.

911
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,476
When I saw him,
I understood my grandma's words.

912
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,193
He was almost dead.

913
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,879
Kia went to war.

914
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:24,074
He lost an arm and a leg.
I spent a good time with him.

915
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,353
We even laughed.
After that, I relativized my miseries.

916
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,199
Yes. For him, it's his whole
life that's screwed up.

917
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,879
Yet, he laughed about it.

918
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,115
Hmm.

919
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,312
It's the only way to bear
the unbearable.

920
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,597
Whatever I repeat myself,
I can't do it.

921
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,119
It's still unbearable.

922
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,957
What I endured lies too heavy on me,
but who can I talk to about it?

923
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,037
- You see?
- Hmm.

924
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,911
My relatives have suffered so much.

925
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,477
I was a stranger in Austria
and I became one here.

926
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,716
I see.
Your sickness has a name.

927
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,354
It's a nervous breakdown.

928
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,313
There are some effective treatments.

929
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,159
I'll prescribe some medication.

930
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,512
Don't you want to come with us?
Some fresh air will do you some good.

931
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,995
No. I want to be alone.

932
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,997
Don't worry.

933
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,315
So, kiddo, what are you doing here?

934
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,238
Well... I'm dead.

935
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,398
My child,
your time hasn't come yet.

936
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,555
Oh really?

937
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,274
My daughter,
you'll have to put yourself out.

938
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,277
He's right for once!

939
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,199
You've got much to do.
Rise and shine.

940
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,794
Go and do what you have to do.

941
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,399
Don't forget that the fight goes on!

942
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,511
Yeah, yeah.
The fight goes on.

943
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,670
Rising up
Back on the street

944
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,113
Did my time
Took my chances

945
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,632
Went the distance
Now l'm back on my feet

946
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,594
Just a man and his will to survive

947
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,873
lt's the eye of the tiger
lt's the cream of the fight

948
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:21,358
Rising up to the challenge of our rival

949
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,519
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night

950
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,429
And he's watching us all in the eye

951
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,753
Of the tiger

952
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,553
I'm so hungry!

953
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,990
- Didn't you eat yet?
- She's on a diet.

954
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,431
- Are you nuts?
- Her cousin asked her
to bring back an issue of Vogue.

955
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,791
She's reading it all the time!

956
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,430
It looks like you've
made a hit with him.

957
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,914
Enough! I'm ashamed.

958
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,440
We'll talk about Botticelli.

959
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,438
Venus Birth in particular.

960
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,234
We could also...

961
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,557
call it The Spring,
like the other great...

962
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,435
..Botticelli's mythology
shown at the Offices.

963
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,073
Hey! You, there!

964
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,998
Why are you laughing?

965
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,916
Do you wanna bet that
I'll take off my veil?

966
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,315
- Yeah right!
- How much do we bet?

967
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,748
400 tomans?

968
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,435
Go!

969
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,912
At the begining of the 90s,
the time of great ideals was over.

970
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,750
After the Revolution, the government
had put so many students in prison

971
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,633
that we didn't dare to talk
about politics anymore.

972
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,350
And the war was finally behind us.

973
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,438
We were looking for happiness
so much that we forgot

974
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,710
that we weren't free.

975
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,593
Grandma, are you here?

976
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,279
Yes, I was here to see you.

977
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,192
How nice, you're all
dressed up to the nines!

978
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,072
Are you in love?

979
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,635
Exactly, I had a date with him.

980
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,276
I got a real fright. Guardians
of the Revolution charged.

981
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,710
Do you see how I'm made-up?

982
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,799
I was stuck. Then I remembered
this guy who was eyeballing me.

983
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,194
You know them.

984
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,358
I couldn't pretend to
be a little defenseless girl.

985
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,989
Brother!

986
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,189
Yes?

987
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,231
A man said indecent things to me.

988
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,318
Where is he so we can shut him up?

989
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,509
Over there.

990
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:42,789
That's him!

991
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,398
Aren't you ashamed?
Don't you have a mother? A sister?

992
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,352
Would you like it
if we insulted them?

993
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,710
Ouch!

994
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,279
I didn't do anything!
I swear it on my mother!

995
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,835
What did they do with the guy?

996
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,678
They picked him up.

997
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,949
Do you think that's funny?

998
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,513
Yes, don't you?

999
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,554
I think that you're a fucking slut!
That's what I think.

1000
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,152
I had no other choice!

1001
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,429
Yes, you had!

1002
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,756
Everybody has a choice.

1003
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,394
Everybody always has a choice!

1004
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:22,117
Your grandfather went to prison
for protecting innocents.

1005
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,629
And your uncle Anouche!

1006
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,432
Did you forget why he died?

1007
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,917
What did I teach you?

1008
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,156
Intergrity!

1009
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,953
Does this word ring a bell, miss?

1010
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,754
Shame on you!

1011
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,753
The lady with the bag!

1012
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,270
Stop running!
The lady with the bag!

1013
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,313
Stop running!
Hey! Stop running!

1014
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,036
Madam, why are you running?

1015
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,912
I'm late.

1016
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,599
You must not run like that.

1017
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,832
When you're running, your behind
makes indecent moves.

1018
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,476
Then don't look at my ass!!!

1019
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,117
Fuck it! Wherever we stand,
we always see the same thing!

1020
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,471
Anatomy lesson my ass! The only
thing sticking out is her big nose.

1021
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,557
Go to the central university
immediately.

1022
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,594
All the absentees

1023
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,030
will be suspended for 2 weeks.

1024
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,036
We must behave correctly.

1025
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,312
The flowers of the Revolution
grew from the blood of our martyrs.

1026
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,798
To have an indecent behavior is like
trampling on the blood of the martyrs.

1027
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,753
So, I'm asking to all
young ladies to wear

1028
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,872
tighter trousers and
longer cowls.

1029
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,755
They must cover their hair
and must not use any make-up.

1030
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,473
Does anybody have a question?

1031
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,036
If not, the session is ended.
Yes?

1032
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,038
Our cowls are short,
our trousers are indecent,

1033
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,832
we put on a lot of make-up, etc.

1034
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,759
I spend a lot of
time at the workshop.

1035
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,679
I need to be able to move
freely to draw.

1036
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,997
A longer cowl makes it difficult.

1037
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:28,677
Our trousers efficiently
hide our shapes.

1038
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,235
Knowing that those trousers
are in fashion,

1039
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,193
is the religion defending
our integrity...

1040
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,392
or is it simply
opposed to fashion?

1041
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,319
You make comments about us
while the brothers...

1042
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,476
have many different clothes
and hair cuts.

1043
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,990
Sometimes, we can even
see their underwears.

1044
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,395
Why is it that as a woman,

1045
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,798
I'm not allowed to feel anything
when watching them,

1046
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,276
while men can get excited on
our shorter cowls?

1047
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,918
It's great. It's as if you had
cut their little dick.

1048
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,633
Take off this fucking cowl.
It makes me claustrophobic.

1049
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,910
I tend to forget it.

1050
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,511
Don't ever forget it.

1051
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,792
It's fear that makes us
lose our self-awareness.

1052
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,117
It's also changing us into cowards.

1053
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,719
You had guts.

1054
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,353
I'm proud of you.

1055
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,473
- I want to leave.
- To go where?

1056
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,238
To the USA or to Europe.

1057
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,229
Where in Europe?

1058
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,351
I can't stand living
here any longer.

1059
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,595
What about us?

1060
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,028
You'll come with me.

1061
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,756
- I don't want to leave.
- That's because you're still nostalgic.

1062
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,235
Sooner or later,
people will disgust you.

1063
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,673
You can die in the West,
nobody cares.

1064
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,518
Don't worry.

1065
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,153
We'll manage.

1066
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,235
What's your relationship with him?

1067
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,515
Good.

1068
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,870
We'll call your parents.

1069
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,719
Either they pay
or it will be some lashing.

1070
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,511
When your mother and I were 15,
we used to walk together holding hands.

1071
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,868
Oh la la!

1072
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,435
And yet it was in this country.

1073
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:32,837
You know, that's how
the situation is now.

1074
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,315
You have to be careful.

1075
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,035
I think it's better if you're
not seen outside anymore.

1076
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,710
This situation is unbearable.
We can't go anywhere.

1077
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,276
We're like prisoners.
It's not a life!

1078
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,631
Yeah... We can only get married.

1079
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,989
So?

1080
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,154
- Did you cry, mom?
- No.

1081
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:35,148
I always wanted you to be
independent, educated and cultured.

1082
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,669
And now you're getting married
at 21 years old!

1083
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,839
I want you to leave Iran
to be free and liberated!

1084
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,075
It's fine.

1085
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,748
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

1086
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,153
- Did you see the car keys?
- Huh?

1087
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,510
I left them here.

1088
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,675
I don't know.

1089
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,712
They were here.

1090
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,073
We don't share anything anymore.

1091
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,874
You're the ideal couple to us.

1092
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,354
Ideal couple, my ass!

1093
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,832
What? You want my picture?

1094
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,436
Asshole!

1095
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:42,837
Not so long ago,
you were saying that you loved him.

1096
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,589
It's impossible to know...

1097
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,949
until we live under the same roof.

1098
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:51,118
What will you do?
Are you gonna get a divorce?

1099
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,558
I don't know.

1100
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,558
My sister left
her husband last year.

1101
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,671
As soon as she got a divorce,

1102
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,077
all men wanted to
have sex with her.

1103
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,111
The butcher proposed her.

1104
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,312
Then the baker and the greengrocer.

1105
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,873
And even the beggars.

1106
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,310
Men are convinced that
their thing is irresistible

1107
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,513
and that a divorced woman will
accept since she's not a virgin anymore.

1108
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,272
Stay with your husband
as long as you can.

1109
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,195
Something's wrong?

1110
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,511
Don't get yourself
into such a state!

1111
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,596
Excuse me.

1112
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,109
What is this sorrow for?

1113
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,390
Grandma!

1114
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,794
It's terrible!

1115
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,036
What's so terrible?

1116
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,312
I think that... I think that
I don't love Reza anymore.

1117
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,750
I think we'll part.

1118
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,679
So this is your terrible thing?

1119
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,791
I thought somebody had died!

1120
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,359
You've no idea what you're saying!
I have a heart condition.

1121
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,074
And you're talking to me like that!

1122
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,909
All those tears for a simple divorce!

1123
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,432
Listen to me carefully.

1124
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,313
I did it 55 years ago.

1125
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,557
Back then,
no one was getting a divorce.

1126
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,389
I knew that I would be happier
alone than with a damned nuisance!

1127
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,350
But...

1128
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,675
No buts!

1129
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,792
A first wedding is a rough
work for the second one.

1130
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,594
It will be better next time.

1131
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,914
You're crying because
you were wrong.

1132
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,510
It's hard to accept your own
mistakes, isn't it?

1133
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,071
Where were you?

1134
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,838
I was very worried.

1135
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,793
Nima is dead.

1136
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,070
Huh? What?

1137
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,589
Nima is dead.

1138
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,549
I'm leaving you.

1139
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:44,040
The time had come for me to leave.

1140
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,276
I decided to go to France.

1141
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,790
I had to wait 3 months for a visa.

1142
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,471
I went to the Caspian sea
with grandma

1143
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,831
where I filled my lungs with
this unique air.

1144
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,794
An air like nowhere else.

1145
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,078
Then I promised grandpa
that he'd be proud of me.

1146
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,391
Then I wnet behind the prison

1147
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,558
where my uncle Anouche was resting,

1148
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,637
somewhere next to
thousands of innocents.

1149
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,628
I promised him to try to be true
to myself as much as possible.

1150
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,149
Then, one day, the time
to leave had come.

1151
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,115
My father cried, as usual.

1152
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,709
you're leaving forever.
You're a free woman.

1153
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,956
Iran of today isn't for you.

1154
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,832
I forbid you to come back.

1155
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,429
Yes, mom.
Grandma!

1156
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,437
My sweet little girl!

1157
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,356
I never saw my grandma again.

1158
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,390
She died a little later.

1159
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,954
Freedom always has a price.

1160
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,396
Ah! What a shitty weather!

1161
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,159
Where do you come from?

1162
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,473
Iran.

1163
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:35,351
Grandma, you always smell good.
How are you doing?

1164
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,393
I pick up jasmine
flowers every morning

1165
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,319
and I put them in my bra.

1166
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,353
This way, I always smell good.

1167
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,074
Wow! It's great!
