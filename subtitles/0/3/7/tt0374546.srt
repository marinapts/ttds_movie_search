1
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,315
Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...
And Spring

2
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:16,920
Spring

3
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:28,054
Wake up

4
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,842
- Master!
- Yes, my boy?

5
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:31,049
Where do you want to go?

6
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,085
I want to pick herbs for medicine

7
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,386
Then let us go.
Come along

8
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,650
I'm going to pick herbs now, Master

9
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:38,448
Watch out for snakes

10
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,307
- Wait for me, Master
- Yes

11
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,189
I've picked a lot of herbs, Master

12
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:04,357
Really? You've picked a lot?

13
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,065
Careful!

14
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,418
Stop! Throw this away, my child

15
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:33,988
Why? It looks the same

16
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,860
Even though it looks the same,
this is a deadly plant

17
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:42,162
The other one can save lives

18
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,330
It still looks the same.
How can I know?

19
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:50,578
Look closely. Here at the tip
you can see a white line

20
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,940
If you ate this plant, you'd die

21
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:58,475
You mustn't pick
this sort of plant next time

22
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,553
- Is this one alright to eat?
- Yes, this one is good

23
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:07,145
Master, there is a stone on my back.
Please take it off

24
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:11,053
- Does it torment you?
- Yes, Master

25
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:14,719
Didn't you also do it to the fish?

26
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,731
Yes, Master

27
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,198
Didn't you also do it to the frog?

28
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,063
Yes, Master

29
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:25,533
Didn't you also do it to the snake?

30
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,541
Yes, Master

31
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,201
Stand up!

32
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:38,910
Walk around!

33
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,458
I can't walk, it's too heavy

34
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:50,664
How do you think the fish,
the frog and the snake endured it?

35
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,465
It was wrong to do it

36
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:58,767
Go and find all the animals
and release them from the stones

37
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,239
Then I will release you too

38
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:07,482
But if any of the animals, the fish,
the frog or the snake is dead,

39
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:14,314
you will carry the stone in your heart
for the rest of your life

40
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:10,412
Summer

41
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:22,675
You look so very healthy

42
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:35,879
This tree is over 300 years old

43
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:40,489
You will become
as healthy as this tree

44
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:16,022
Greetings

45
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,093
Come in

46
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:17,082
Will she recover, wise one?

47
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:21,511
I believe that her soul is suffering

48
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,490
When she finds peace in her soul,
her body will return to health

49
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:31,158
Please take care of her!

50
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,694
Excuse me

51
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:16,533
You are not allowed to sit on that

52
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,936
The master will be angry with you

53
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:47,552
Why are you praying all of a sudden?

54
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:22,722
Would you like to come along?

55
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:19,720
Softly!
It must prepared with a true heart

56
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:39,603
Drink!

57
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,576
It will clear your head

58
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:30,136
The boat is floating away!

59
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,128
Stop it!

60
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,820
Stop it!

61
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:03,252
Have you recovered now?

62
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:05,917
Yes, I have completely recovered

63
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:07,888
Strange

64
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,955
When I can't see you,
I go insane

65
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:13,296
What is wrong with me?

66
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:01,290
Cold! It's cold!

67
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:03,796
What shall I do?

68
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:12,842
I did wrong, Master.
Forgive me

69
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:16,079
That happens by itself.
It is just nature

70
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,918
Are you still sick?

71
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:24,186
No

72
00:47:25,726 --> 00:47:28,490
Then it was the right medicine

73
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:35,097
Now that you have recovered,
you can leave this place

74
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:37,463
No, Master! She can't!

75
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:44,577
Lust awakens the desire to possess.
And that awakens the intent to murder

76
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:47,913
Get in

77
00:51:23,563 --> 00:51:27,659
Fall

78
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:52,784
That was tiring, huh?

79
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:36,025
MAN, 30, FLEES AFTER MURDERING WIFE

80
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:54,163
You have grown a lot!

81
00:55:55,468 --> 00:55:57,026
Get in!

82
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,456
So? Have you led
a happy life up till now?

83
00:56:58,565 --> 00:57:02,057
Tell me something
interesting about your life

84
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:08,040
The world of men has grown
agonizing for you, hasn't it?

85
00:57:08,074 --> 00:57:11,373
Leave alone, Master.
Can you not see that I am suffering?

86
00:57:11,544 --> 00:57:13,444
What causes you to suffer?

87
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,107
My only sin was to love

88
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,647
I wanted nothing except her

89
00:57:18,985 --> 00:57:20,885
So?

90
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:23,548
She went with another man

91
00:57:23,656 --> 00:57:25,180
Ah, that was it

92
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:28,522
How can that be?
She said that she'd love only me

93
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:32,060
- And then?
- I couldn't bear it any more

94
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:34,565
Didn't you know beforehand
how the world of men is?

95
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:38,137
Sometimes we have to
let go of things we like

96
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:41,702
What you like,
others will also like!

97
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:43,674
But still, how could she do that?

98
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:46,537
The bitch!

99
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:50,975
- Is it so unbearable for you?
- Yes!

100
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:36,981
Master!

101
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:41,519
Master!

102
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:11,674
Young fool!

103
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:15,236
Young fool!

104
01:04:50,102 --> 01:04:55,404
Though you can so easily kill,
you yourself cannot be easily killed

105
01:04:56,075 --> 01:05:00,068
Carve out all of
these characters with the knife

106
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:05,543
And while you cut out each one,
drive out the anger from your heart

107
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:13,775
Holy one!

108
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:18,151
Holy one!

109
01:06:42,615 --> 01:06:45,277
We've come to investigate something

110
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:17,311
- Drop the knife!
- Otherwise I'll shoot!

111
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:24,252
What are you doing?
Continue cutting!

112
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:36,063
Prajnaparamita Sutra.
It helps restore inner peace

113
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,861
Please let him finish

114
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,802
How long will it take?

115
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,401
Until tomorrow morning

116
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,892
- No connection
- No?

117
01:08:06,031 --> 01:08:07,862
It's quite a deep valley, isn't it?

118
01:08:29,955 --> 01:08:31,684
What?

119
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:20,613
They make white paint
from these mussels

120
01:13:30,022 --> 01:13:31,887
Stand up

121
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:34,253
It's time to go

122
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:51,400
Detective Choi,
let's go as we are

123
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:29,140
Detective Chi,
the boat won't go forwards

124
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,813
Ah, now it's moving

125
01:18:59,951 --> 01:19:03,478
Winter

126
01:38:42,733 --> 01:38:46,601
And Spring
