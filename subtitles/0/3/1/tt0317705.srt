ANNOUNCER: In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued

157
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,327
for saving someone who,
apparently, didn't want to be saved.

158
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,079
The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,

159
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,624
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,

160
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,711
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

161
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,132
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

162
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,218
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions,"

163
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,637
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

164
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,973
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

165
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,766
LAWYER: My client has no comment.

166
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,479
ANNOUNCER: Another suit was filed
by victims of the El train accident.

167
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,649
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

168
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:55,112
And opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

169
00:10:55,196 --> 00:11:00,159
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

170
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,245
Time for them to join us, or go away.

171
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,248
ANNOUNCER: Under public pressure,
and the financial burden

172
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,792
of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,

173
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,921
the government quietly initiated
the Superhero Relocation Program.

174
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,466
The supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions,

175
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:20,888
in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work.

176
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,681
Where are they now?

177
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:27,019
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

178
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,441
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

179
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,403
Denied? You're denying my claim?

180
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,032
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

181
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,284
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

182
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,827
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

183
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,748
- It states clearly...
- (STAMMERING) I can't pay for this.

184
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,625
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

185
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,294
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

186
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,671
We're now officially moved in.

187
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,548
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

188
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,967
The last three years
don't count because...

189
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,096
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

190
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,598
HELEN: Why do we have
so much junk?

191
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,183
Listen, I've got a client.

192
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,353
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

193
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,730
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

194
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,733
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

195
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:19,363
(SOBBING) I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

196
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,490
I don't know what I'll do.

197

All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

200
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:36,296
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

201
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,341
(WHISPERING) Norma Wilcox.

202
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,677
On the third floor. But I can't.

203
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,806
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

204
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,849
with our legal department
on the second floor.

205
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,186
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

206
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,605
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

207
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,982
Oh, thank you, young man.

208
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,818
(SHOUTING) Sorry.
I know you're upset!

You authorized payment

into their house, Mr. Huph.

214
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,208
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

215
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,129
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

216
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,423
Tell me how that's possible,

Morning break is over.

219
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,647
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

220
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,068
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

221
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,323
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

222
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,783
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

223
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,911
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

224
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,789
Well... Not really. No.

225
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:53,999
Actually, not.

226
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,126
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

227
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,754
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

228
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,637

00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,348
You don't see it?

230
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,935
He moves! Right there!

00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,439
Wait, wait! Right there!

232
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,149
Right as I'm sitting down!

233
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,942
I don't know how he does it,

234
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,278
but there's no tack before he moves

235
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,491
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

236

- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

You and your son can go now,
Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble.

239
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,173
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

240

You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

241
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,394
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

242
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,981
We need to find a better outlet.
A more constructive outlet.

243
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,901
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

244
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,112
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

245
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:09,741
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,701
Dashiell Robert Parr,

247
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,288
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

248

The last thing you need is temptation.

249
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,961
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

250
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,255
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

251
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,966
Right now, honey,
the world just wants us to fit in,

252
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,593
and to fit in, we just gotta be
like everybody else.

Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

611
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,901
- Jeez.
- HELEN: Hurry, honey.

612
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,320
Or you'll be late for work.

613
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,782
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

614
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,743
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

615
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,870
All that jazz.

616
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,580
(LAUGHING)

617
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,879
You have an appointment?

618
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,798
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

619
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,802
- All visitors are required...
- E: Go check the electric fence.

620
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,929
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

621
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,226
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.
Come, come.

622
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:36,238
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

623
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:40,617
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

624
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,495
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

625
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,914
Milan, darling. Milan.

626
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,960
E: Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

627
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,212
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

628
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,840
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

629
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,844
Feh! I used to design for gods.

630
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:05,016
But perhaps you come with a challenge,
eh? I was surprised to get your call.

631
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,435
E, I just need a patch job.

632
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,814
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

633
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,443
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

634
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,113
Moonlighting hero work?

635
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,031
Must have happened a long time ago.

636
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:23,159
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

637
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,745
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

638
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,000
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

639
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,211
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

640
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,922
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

641
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,508
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

642
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,011
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

643
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,305
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

644
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,266
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

645
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,686
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

646
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,856
- E: It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

647
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,149
Heroic!

648
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,861
Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

649
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,615
Oh! He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

650
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,741
E: No capes!

651
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,913
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

652
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,749
E: Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

653
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,127
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

654
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,672
E: All was well, another day saved

655
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,550
when his cape snagged
on a missile fin.

656
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,969
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

657
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,054
Stratogale!

658
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:29,434
E: April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

659
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,811
You can't generalize
about these things.

660
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,190
E: Meta-Man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

661
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:39,069
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

662
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,572
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

663
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,699
You know I'm retired from hero work.

664
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:48,036
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

665
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,499
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

666
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,670
(SIGHS) Fine.
I will also fix the hobo suit.

667
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,341
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

668
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,353
(PHONE RINGS)

669
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,648
BOB: Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

670
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,484
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

671
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,408
MIRAGE: How soon can you get here?
BOB: I'll leave tomorrow morning.

672
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,284
- MIRAGE: See you there.
- Goodbye.

673
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,790
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

674
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,793
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

675
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,712
duty calls. (NERVOUS LAUGH)

676
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,555
- HELEN: Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

677
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,143
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

678
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,812
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

679
00:46:55,896 --> 00:47:00,066
- So much.
- I love you, too.

680
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,165
SHIP'S COMPUTER:
This is your automated Captain.

681
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,418
Would you care for more mimosa?

682
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,671
- BOB: Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

683
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:27,969
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

684
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,687
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

685
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,715
MIRAGE: Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

686
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,091
Thanks.

687
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,928
Nice to be back, Mirage.

688
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,457
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

689
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,961
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

690
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,546
See you there.

691
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,496
(GASPS) Edna.

692
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,457
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- E: This is Edna.

693
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,252
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

694
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,589
Helen Parr? You know...

695
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:29,799
Elastigirl?

696
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:34,137
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

697
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,972
(STAMMERING) It's been a while.

698
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,515
There's only one person
Bob would trust

699
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,309
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

700
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,352
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

701
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,606
Much better than those
horrible pajamas he used to wear.

702
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,191
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

703
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,360
- HELEN: I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

704
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,945
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg?

705
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,656
No, I'm calling about suit.

706
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,492
(STAMMERING) Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

707
00:49:56,577 --> 00:50:00,371
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

708
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,886
Hmm.

709
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,808
(CREAKING)

710
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,112
SYNDROME: It's bigger!

711
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,491
It's badder!

712
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:43,081
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

713
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,876
It's finally ready.

714
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:51,339
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

715
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,884
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

716
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,972
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

717
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,141
Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it.

718
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:06,396
I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan.

719
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,984
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

720
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,820
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

721
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,365
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

722
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,702
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

723
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,454
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

724
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:27,291
SYNDROME: It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

725
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,335
You can't count on anyone.

726
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,337
Especially your heroes.

727
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,716
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

728
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,219
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

729
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,762
That's the way it works.

730
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,598
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

731
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,268
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

732
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,937
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

733
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:52,066
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

734
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,946
(LAUGHING) You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

735
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,865
I can't believe it.

736
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:06,080
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

737
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,708
Am I good enough now?

738
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,794
Who's super now?

739
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,380
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

740
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,633
Oh, brilliant!

741
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,557
(COUGHING)

742
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,071
All right, try this one on for size,
big boy.

BOB: Kronos?

746
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,651
SCANNER: Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

747
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,367
E: This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

748
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,705
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

749
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:15,084
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

750
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,003
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

751
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,631
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

752
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,510
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

753
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,888
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

754
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,891
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

755
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,059
That is why I show you my work.

756
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,853
That is why you are here.

757
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,695
Edna Mode.

758
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,448
And guest.

759
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,091
Come. Sit.

760
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,806
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

761
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,643
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

762
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,730
E: Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

763
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,733
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

764
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:25,738
E: And can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

765
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,909
Completely bulletproof.

766
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,872
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

767
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,875
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

768
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,088
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

769
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,341
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

770
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,969
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

771
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,845
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

772
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,893
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

773
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:59,563
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

774
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,984
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

775
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:08,447
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

776
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:16,372
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

777
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,499
and still retain its shape.

778
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,544
Virtually indestructible,

779
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,298
yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

780
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,968
As an extra feature,
each suit contains a homing device,

781
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:33,306
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

782
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,435
Well, darling? What do you think?

783
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,064
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

784
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,649
Our family is underground.

785
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,902
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

786
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,530
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

787
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,491
Why would he keep secrets from you?

788
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,202
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

789
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,206
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

790
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,752
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

791
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,379
Do you know where he is?

792
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:08,382
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

I was wondering if you could give me
the number of the hotel he's staying at?

That's the way to do it.

- Yeah. No school like the old school.

- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

Not as cool as you running on water.

1262

That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

and whiplashed him into the other guy.

You took away my future.

I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

he might make a good sidekick.
