1
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:49,482
Always remember your promise to me.

2
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,640
Never let nobody or nothing
turn you into no cripple.

3
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:15,663
All right!

4
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:17,289
Rest stop, 45 minutes.

5
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:19,667
Come on, folks. We gotta move.

6
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:23,003
We leave at 2:45 p.m.
On the dot. Can't be late.

7
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,215
Hot meals and bathrooms inside.

8
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,051
All right, uh, there's a
window out back ...

9
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:30,511
for y'all to buy sandwiches.

10
00:02:30,594 --> 00:02:33,097
And I suggest you make
good use of them outhouses.

11
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,599
Ain't nothing but bushes
for you in the Carolinas.

12
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:36,892
Sir.

13
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:40,896
Can I help you, sir?

14
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:42,064
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:44,567
Seattle?

16
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:47,236
Who you riding with?

17
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:48,904
Nobody. Just me.

18
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:51,574
Boy, I can't take responsibility ...

19
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,493
for some blind nigger
traveling 3,500 miles alone.

20
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,745
I ... I ... I paid for this here
ticket, and it says ...

21
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,873
that you have to take me
to Seattle.

22
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,584
Don't you be smarting off
to me, boy.

23
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,712
With all due respect, sir,
I believe I earned the right.

24
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:06,672
I may have left my eyes
on Omaha Beach,

25
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,841
but I ain't asking no charity
from Uncle Sam.

26
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:11,176
I got a job waiting
for me in Seattle.

27
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:13,846
You were in Normandy?

28
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:16,223
Shuttling troopers to the beach.

29
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:18,475
We took a direct hit.

30
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:24,982
I'm sorry, son.

31
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,777
I'll keep an eye on you myself.

32
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:31,196

00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:19,620
Billy, don't get
your feathers all ruffled now.

44
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:22,414
I met this ol' boy over
at the O.C. At Clarkfield,

45
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:24,083
and well, he plays
a mean jazz piano.

46
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,460
I don't care if he whistles
Dixie out his ass.

47
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,504
He ain't gonna do it here.

48
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:29,880
Sir.

49
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,882
Boy, are you blind?

50
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,592
Yes, sir. Since I was seven.

51
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:37,054
Well, let me help you out then.

52
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:39,265
This is a country band.

53
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,642
We don't play no boogie-woogie.

54
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,270
Uh, yes, I understand.
I love country music.

55
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:46,855
All right, go on. Tell me.

56
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:49,400
What is it you love
about country music?

57
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:50,776
I ... I love the stories.

58
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:52,403
Uh, you know,
about fallin' in love ...

59
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,154
and having love
knock you around ...

60
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:56,198
and then the pressures
of the world on you so tough.

61
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:57,533
It ... It makes you
feel small.

62
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,034
You want to give your soul to God.

63
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:01,078
You might as well.
Your ass belongs to Him.

64
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,630
Boy, are you sure you blind?

65
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:13,090
Last time I checked.

66
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:27,646
Okay. Come on in.

67
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:44,246
Billy, I think you're outvoted.

68
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,707
Til, one hint of trouble,

69
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,584
and your blind nigra's out of here.

70
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:51,545
Damn!

71
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,255
Here.

72
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:55,925
I'm gonna have
to put some glasses

73
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,594
before he scares
somebody half to death.

74
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:10,147
Seattle, Washington, folks.

75
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,233
Change bus here
for all points north:

76
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:13,943
Bellingham, Mount Vernon.

77
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,653
Vancouver, Canada.

78
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:36,549
Uh, that's Diz. Emanon.

79
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,385
Yeah. But what's it
spell backwards?

80
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:40,719
Ah ... ah ... ah, come on, man.

81
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:43,013
Why don't you give me
something difficult?

82
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,348
"No Name."

83
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,935
Say, daddy-o, what ax you play?

84
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:48,978
Uh, piano.

85
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,396
Just blew in from Tampa, Florida.

86
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,314
Me and my partner,
Gossie McGee, came here,

87
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,024
you know, want to
fatten up our style.

88
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:56,402
Cop some licks from some more
experienced cats. You dig?

89
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:57,653
You know what?

90
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,321
Why don't you let me
take you inside?

91
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,531
You know, show you around.

92
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:02,157
- All right.
- Perfect gentleman.
- Yeah.

93
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,701
This is just like my place.

94
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:04,994
So, what's your name?

95
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:06,120
Ray Robinson.

96
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:07,246
I'm Quincy Jones.

97
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,289
Quincy Jones.

98
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,666
Hey, Gerry!
This here's my man, Ray.

99
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:12,501
He's here to see his friend,
Gossie McGee.

100
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:14,086
So I figured
I'll show him inside ...

101
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,338
Don't mess with me, Q.
He can come in, but not you.

102
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:18,883
Vice is on my ass for letting
you underage kids in.

103
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:20,092
Get out of here, Q.

104
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:21,635
- Can't you see ...
- Get out of here, Q.

105
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:23,512
- He's blind! I gotta show him in.
- Get out.

106
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:25,347
- Jive-ass.
- What?

107
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:28,183
Hey, Ray Robinson, when am I
gonna hear you play, baby?

108
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:29,852
Uh, well, that may cost you.

109
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:35,399
Welcome, all you cool cats
and fine felines.

110
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:38,402
You've come to the place where
the sophisti-cats and hipsters ...

111
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:40,362
hang their bebop hats.

112
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:42,698
So snuggle up and come near ...

113
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:44,366
for tonight is Talent Night
at The Rocking Chair.

114
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:49,830
Let's hear it for "Dancin' Al!"

115
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:02,760
Gossie's been cattin' around with one
of my waitresses since he got here.

116
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,971
He never told me that his partner
was a blind 'Bama boy.

117
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,474
Marlene, Demurs just called.

118
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,434
Thurmond's sick.

119
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:11,936
What about Sassy?

120
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,229
Flat tire.

121
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:24,240
Okay, 'Bama. Why don't you get on
up there and show me what you got?

122
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:27,326
Well, I — I'm not prepared to do
my thing right now, tonight ...

123
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,578
This is the only audition
you're going to get, puddin'.

124
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,207
So either get on up there, or you and
Gossie can haul your asses back down South.

125
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,209
Here. Smoke some of this.

126
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:40,756
This ain't no tobacco, man.

127
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,716
No, hold it in,
it'll calm you down.

128
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,134
All right, Oberon.

129
00:08:44,218 --> 00:08:45,678
Get on up there and introduce him.

130
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,137
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,974
Okay, 'Bama. Let's go.

132
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:52,518
Yeah.

133
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:59,400
Now, I got something special
for all you satin dolls.

134
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:02,194
And I don't mean
Oberon's big thunder.

135
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:05,114
Now that's for another show.

136
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,408
Now we got some new blood for ya.

137
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:09,618
Yeah, straight off
the bus from Florida,

138
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,498
I give you Ray
"Don't Call Me Sugar" Robinson!

139
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:25,217
How y'all doing tonight?

140
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:26,510
Better than you!

141
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:30,764
Relax, Ray. Relax.

142
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:31,974
I got it.

143
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:39,523
Uh-uh, what do y'all want to hear?

144
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:43,736
How about a little Nat King Cole?

145
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:52,161
Y'all like Nat King Cole?

146
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:59,460
♪ If you ever plan to travel west ♪

147
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,379
'Bama ain't bad.

148
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,215
Yeah, I'd say he saved our asses.

149
00:10:06,717 --> 00:10:08,510
What the hell is
Ray doin' up there?

150
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:10,512
Auditioning for you, Gossie.

151
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:13,057
He ain't no good without me.

152
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:17,019
How'd you and the 'Bama like to
do a week here at the Chair?

153
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:18,479
I know a good bass player.

154
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,857
A nice jazz trio could score
big with the right manager.

155
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:23,901
Manager?

156
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:26,654
Come on now, Gossie,
don't be so small-minded.

157
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:28,280
You know you've got to give to get.

158
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:30,366
Now what exactly do I have to give?

159
00:10:30,407 --> 00:10:31,784
25 percent.

160
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,369
But I'll be gettin' you other gigs.

161
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:36,372
All right,

favor, man, and close that bag for me?

Jack Lauderdale have to say?

Jack Lauderdale tonight,

and he gave me a $500
advance on my record.

314
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,442
He also said he'll put me

and pay me three times

Now, that's a lie!

317

Hey, no way he's not gonna put some
blind man on the road. Think about it.

00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:28,742
I mean, you ... you need
watchin' out for.

319
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:31,036
And he ain't got the time to
look after you the way I do.

320
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,539
Is that what you've been doing,
Gossie? Watchin' out for me?

321
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,457
Is that why you get
paid double what I do?

322
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,168
Who told you that?

323
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:39,295
It's true, ain't it?

324
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:41,380
You two have been
gaming me since I got here.

325
00:17:41,463 --> 00:17:43,424
Ray, baby, listen ...
I ain't listening to you!

326
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:45,885
Ray, I've ... I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

327
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,012
Then why aren't you talkin'?

328
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,641
Um, look, Ray, Ray,
let's not do nothin' stupid.

329
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:54,476
I might be blind,
but I ain't stupid!

330
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:56,228
Q., get my bag from upstairs.

331
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:57,438
- What?
- Get it!

332
00:17:57,521 --> 00:17:58,981
- Wha ... right now?
- Now.

333
00:17:59,064 --> 00:18:01,317
Ray, man, we done been
through a whole lot.

334
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:04,111
Ray, now wait a minute.
I can explain everything.

335
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:06,113
Think about what you're doing.

336
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:08,032
Ray, Ray, now you're makin'
a big mistake.

337
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:10,117
That clown is spoutin'
promises that he can't keep.

338
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,952
You'd be a fool to follow him.

339
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:13,329
Ray, Ray, we'll make a new deal!

340
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:14,538
Whatever makes you happy!

341
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,540
The deal is
you can lay the pipe now.

342
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:20,044
You'll break your neck going down
these stairs by yourself. Hang on.

343
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:21,545
Oh, man.

344
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:25,382
Ray, I ain't never seen you do
nothing like that, man. Never.

345
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:27,176
That ain't nothing, Seven-oh.

346
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:41,982
Stop cheating, Ray.

347
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:45,444
George, you can't catch me.
Come on.

348
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:46,862
Aretha!

349
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:48,864
Come on, George.

350
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:51,450
Aretha Robinson,
have you lost your mind?

351
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:54,828
Eula, you promised to split every
wash basket with me, fair and square!

352
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:55,996
And I did!

353
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,164
Hell, you did!

354
00:18:57,248 --> 00:18:59,333
You charge white folks
one thing and pay me another.

355
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,834
Now who's gonna wash these?

356
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:02,378
You can. Now pay me my money!

357
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:07,967
Okay, I'm a-giving you
your two little dollars.

358
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,177
But don't you be expectin'
no more work out of me!

359
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:11,679
I got all I need out of you.

360
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:13,264
Ray and George, come on!

361
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:14,932
That's right.
Get out of my yard ...

362
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:16,767
and don't y'all never come back!

363
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,439
Y'all got to learn
to read and write real good,

364
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:25,276
so you never have to work
for people like that.

365
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,069
Scratch a liar, find a thief.

366
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,112
Understand?

367
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,321
Yes, Mama.

368
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:44,920
Smell that, Ray.
Smell the success.

369
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:46,630
We're in LA, man,

370
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,966
the place where the Negro
comes to spread his wings.

371
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:51,468
You ... you know, man, I know
my ears ain't deceivin' me.

372
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,553
Is that Art Tatum?

373
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:54,263
It sure is, baby.
You want to meet him?

374
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:57,016
I ... I can't meet him.
A-Art Tatum is the most.

375
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:06,734
So, Ray, we got to talk about
your name, man: Robinson.

376
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:09,695
Sugar Ray got the Robinson
franchise all sewed up.

377
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:13,449
So I'm thinkin' we go with
your middle name, Charles.

378
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:15,367
As in, Ray Charles.

379
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,161
I don't care
what you call me, man,

380
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:19,038
just as long as my name's
on the record.

381
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:20,497
But we're gonna toast to that.

382
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:21,874
Hey, what's the haps, Jack?

383
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:23,584
Oh, my goodness.
Give me some skin.

384
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,711
What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

385
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:29,381
Lowell Fulson, meet your new
piano player: Ray Charles.

386
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:32,009
Ray Charles, the blind sensation.

387
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:35,888
Ow! Damn! I'm gonna use that
on the album cover.

388
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,389
He's really the sensation.

389
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,308
I ... I love your music,
Mr. Fulson.

390
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,768
Uh, the man's got taste.

391
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,145
Hey, and the man ain't
been on the road ...

392
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:45,439
with a band before,
so now you take care of him.

393
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:46,857
Like my own brother.

394
00:20:50,444 --> 00:20:51,695
Ray.

395
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:53,697
I'm gonna be right back.

396
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:54,823
All right.

397
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:57,993
Yeah, you got the one
on the left.

398
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,828
Look here,
let me do the talking.

399
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,150
Don't go inside that place.

400
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:31,694
You know what Mama said.

401
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:34,238
Go home
and don't tell Mama nothin'.

402
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,115
Go, George.

403
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:42,413
George, get out of here!

404
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:11,025
Hey, boy, who let you in?

405
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:13,402
You must be Aretha's son, huh?

406
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:15,696
Yes, sir. Ray Charles Robinson.

407
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:18,908
I've been seeing you
sneakin' around here.

408
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,910
You like the piano, huh?

409
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:23,537
Come on, you want
to learn how to play?

410
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:24,914
Come on over here.

411
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:26,707
Let me show you how to play.
Come on.

412
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,001
I'm gonna teach you how to play.

413
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:32,004
What we'll do, I'm gonna teach
you three notes, right?

414
00:22:32,087 --> 00:22:34,173
This is the first note,
right here.

415
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:36,842
Play that.

416
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,346
And here's the second note,
right here.

417
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:42,765
Play that.

418
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:46,101
Here's the third note.

419
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:50,439
Now, here's the way it goes.

420
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,107
Listen. Listen closely, now.

421
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,196
Play that.

422
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,115
Good!

423
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:03,035
Try the other notes.

424
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:13,337
Every club we hit,

425
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,881
it's your responsibility
to rehearse the band.

426
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:18,008
These are some lazy-ass bastards,

427
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:20,386
so you gotta make sure
that they don't slough off.

428
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:22,930
You gotta be ready
and dressed to open the show.

429
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:25,349
Now, Lowell likes to take
a nap before he goes on.

430
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:28,477
You just do your thing
until he feels like comin' out.

431
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:31,480
And when Lowell's playin',
you keep the band sharp.

432
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:32,523
Uh ... uh, just one thing.

433
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:33,524
What?

434
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:35,734
Did Jack tell you that
I have to be paid in singles?

435
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:39,247

00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:08,364
Fathead, open up. Open up.
I got to take a leak.

475
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:14,161
Hey, what you doing, man?
Close the door, Fat!

476
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,705
Say, Ray, we'll be in here
for a little while.

477
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:19,542
Use the women's can,
down there on your right.

478
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,168
I don't want to use
the women's can.

479
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:22,294
This way, alright.

480
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:43,399
Oh, God!

481
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,235
Say, Ray, you all right?

482
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:49,113
Yeah, I must have slipped
on the wet.

483
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:50,281
There's a pipe broke.

484
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:51,907
There's water everywhere.
You see it?

485
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:53,909
Let's go, man. Close the door.

486
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:55,369
All right, quit playing, Ray.

487
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:57,913
We'll be in here a while.
Now go on now!

488
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:06,672
Where you from, Ray?

489
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:07,965
North Florida.

490
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:09,884
Oh, North Florida boy.

491
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:11,594
Your people still down there?

492
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:12,887
No.

493
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:15,222
All right.

494
00:28:15,723 --> 00:28:17,224
Hey, uh, pardon me for askin',

495
00:28:17,308 --> 00:28:19,226
but how do you
get around so good ...

496
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,186
without a cane or a dog?

497
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:24,857
How do you get around so good
without a cane or dog?

498
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:27,067
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

499
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,238
My ears got to be my eyes, man.
Its ...

500
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:33,282
Everything sounds different.

501
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:35,451
You know that's why
I wear hard-soled shoes,

502
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:37,494
so I can hear my footsteps
echo off the wall.

503
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:40,789
So when I pass by an open
doorway, the sound changes.

504
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:42,333
Wow. That's cool.

505
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:46,378
You know you got to learn pretty quick
if you want to get around on your own.

506
00:28:46,462 --> 00:28:47,588
Yeah.

507
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:50,466
You know, during the war,
there was a whole lot ...

508
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,760
I had to learn fast,
or I wouldn't be here.

509
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:57,723
Seein' that much death
ain't natural.

510
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,936
Yeah, seein' death ain't natural.

511
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:08,400
Boys, get from 'round that still.

512
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:09,860
Y'all know better than that.

513
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:11,362
Come on, catch me.

514
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,911
Stay from 'round this fire
and get clean.

515
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:20,579
Dinner will be ready soon.

516
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:22,122
Hear me, Ray?

517
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,167
I got you. I got you.

518
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:26,627
No, you didn't. You missed me.

519
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,003
Stop cheatin', Ray.

520
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,673
Okay, you got me.

521
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:32,508
But I got you back.

522
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,301
I'm not playin' no more.

523
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:35,719
Sissy!

524
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:39,807
Come on, Ray.
Let's go swimmin'.

525
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:44,478
Let's go swim in Mama's washtub.

526
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:47,648
Ray, come on, Ray, play with me.

527
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:50,025
You better get down
before Mama sees you.

528
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:51,569
I'm a giant!

529
00:29:55,698 --> 00:29:57,157
Some giant.

530
00:29:58,242 --> 00:30:01,036
Come on, George.
I ain't playin' this game.

531
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,581
That ain't funny.

532
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:08,210
Boys, I got some field peas
and rice cooking.

533
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:10,880
And there's that smothered
corn left from yesterday.

534
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:14,925
And if you're real good, I might
have two pieces of peach cobbler.

535
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:18,387
Ray, didn't I tell you
to get in this house?

536
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,392
Dear God, no!

537
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,315
That's Aretha's boy!

538
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,774
Breathe, baby, breathe.

539
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:34,236
Just breathe, baby, breathe.
Let it out!

540
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,113
Let it out, please!

541
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,615
Breathe for your mama, now.

542
00:30:37,698 --> 00:30:39,033
Come on, George.

543
00:30:39,283 --> 00:30:41,410
Why didn't you do somethin'?

544
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:43,329
Why didn't you call me?

545
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:46,582
Help us, Lord!

546
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:48,250
The Lord done took him home.

547
00:30:57,885 --> 00:30:59,094
All right.

548
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,931
Food and piss stop. Open it up.

549
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:07,937
The food is hot.
You've got 45 minutes.

550
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:10,397
- I could eat a horse.
- Where's it?

551
00:31:10,564 --> 00:31:12,566
Follow your nose. Right over there.

552
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:14,443
Wilbur.

553
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:15,569
What?

554
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,947
45 minutes ain't enough time.

555
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:19,490
We need more than that, Jack.

556
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:21,158
Not to eat, you don't.

557
00:31:21,242 --> 00:31:23,327
Now if you got other business,
you better choose,

558
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,912
because this bus
is rollin' on time.

559
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:28,249
Come on, Mercedes got
a washroom in the back.

560
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:31,126
And you, you can smell it.

561
00:31:32,836 --> 00:31:33,837
Jeff.

562
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:34,922
Yes, sir?

563
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:36,257
Uh, could you help me in there?

564
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,716
Sure thing, Ray.

565
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,801
Hey, Mercedes.

566
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:41,679
Hey, baby. I hope you wiped
your feet before you came in here.

567
00:31:41,762 --> 00:31:43,180
- There you go. Come on.
- Take that.

568
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:45,140
The bathroom's right there
in front of you.

569
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:46,183
Okay.

570
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:47,476
You want me to fix you a plate?

571
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,852
Uh, no, I'm ... I'm fine.

572
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:50,312
All right.

573
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:52,273
Sweet potato pie it is.

574
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:54,817
Whoo, let's go, man.

575
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,652
That was a long bus ride,
wasn't it?

576
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:57,820
Oh, come on, man.

577
00:31:57,903 --> 00:32:00,990
Hey, man!
The can's down the hall.

578
00:32:01,073 --> 00:32:02,950
I know where the can is.
What y'all doing?

579
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:04,660
Do yourself a favor and leave.

580
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:06,579
I'll leave when
I'm gettin' ready to leave.

581
00:32:06,662 --> 00:32:08,163
Come on, Fathead, I want in.

582
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:09,957
This ain't no weed, Ray.

583
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:12,042
And we ain't snorting no bitch.

584
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:13,335
This is boy.

585
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:15,880
Boy'll make your ass
null and void.

586
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:17,506
So get on out of here, man.

587
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,425
Null and void, just like my life.

588
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:21,135
I'll be right at home.

589
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:22,887
Look, I ain't gonna
wait all night.

590
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:24,680
Hell, it's his funeral, man.

591
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:28,767
Ray, let's go get
something to eat.

592
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:30,436
I'll leave when I get a taste.

593
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,687
Ray, what you gonna do, man?

594
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,189
This train's pullin' out, brother.

595
00:32:33,272 --> 00:32:35,107
I ain't having nothin'
to do with this.

596
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,859
- I warned you, Ray.
- Come on, man.

597
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:38,152
I been warned.

598
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:39,486
Sit down, Ray. Right there.

599
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,071
I'm gonna take you
on a little ride.

600
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:43,824
It'll cost you, though.
You got some cash?

601
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,326
Will this do?

602
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:47,077
That'll do.

603
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,207
Where you been?
Where them other fools?

604
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:52,750
Come on, get it while it's hot!

605
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:56,420
You're going to feel
a little pinch.

606
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:00,716
I ain't givin' up on you, boy.

607
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:03,677
Feel it, baby?

608
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:06,639
Just take the ride.

609
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:09,600
It's better than sex.

610
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:12,311
There ain't nothin'
better than sex.

00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:14,183
No, I don't like it. It stings.

634
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:15,726
Boy, get up here.

635
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,230
I paid a whole dollar for it.
It better work.

636
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:21,774
Now hold up your head,
like the doctor says.

637
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:23,817
This is gonna make you feel better.

638
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,407
Ray, come on in for dinner.

639
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:32,785
And stop rubbin' those eyes.

640
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:46,757
Ray, I won't beat around
the bush with you.

641
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,092
You're goin' blind.

642
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:51,554
The doctor's sayin' there's nothing they
can do, so we got to do it ourselves.

643
00:35:51,595 --> 00:35:52,680
Yes, ma'am, I know, but ...

644
00:35:52,763 --> 00:35:53,722
Stop it.

645
00:35:53,764 --> 00:35:55,349
Stop it right now.

646
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:57,351
We ain't got no time
for no tears.

647
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:59,061
Ain't nobody gonna
have no pity on you ...

648
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,437
just 'cause you're goin' blind.

649
00:36:00,521 --> 00:36:01,689
Now wipe them eyes.

650
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:03,148
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,444
Okay, I'll show you
how to do something once.

652
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:09,154
I'll help you if you mess up twice.

653
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:10,906
But the third time,
you're on your own,

654
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,367
'cause that's the way
it is in the world.

655
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,910
All right, now get up.

656
00:36:16,787 --> 00:36:19,999
Remember, you goin' blind,
but you ain't stupid.

657
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:23,669
Remember how many stairs
there were?

658
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:25,087
Four.

659
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:28,632
Good. You're gonna have to learn
how to use your memory.

660
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:29,884
Now turn around.

661
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,886
I want you
to hold out your hands,

662
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,889
and use them as your eyes,
and find the door.

663
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:39,101
Good. That's real good, baby.

664
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:50,404

671
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:36,659
Well, he's got somethin',
ain't he?

672
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:39,161
His wax won't even hit the charts.

No, man, she's fine. She's fine.
You leave her alone.

679
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:57,888
Look at Ray.

680
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,764
You see that?

681
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:00,516
He feels her wrist
'cause he figures ...

682
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:02,852
that's the way to tell
if she's good-looking or not.

You know I had my eye on you

Oh, he right this time.

685
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,403
See what a little fame does
to Null and Void?

686
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,906
Anybody see that fine-looking
gal in the yellow dress?

687
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,617
You hear this man?

00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:20,160
You snooze, you lose.

689
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:21,996
We gonna dock your pay, man.

690
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,998

It's a shame, Jimmy.

698
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:00,075
You're just gonna
piss this right up your arm.

699
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,703
You don't tell me
what to do with my money.

700
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,749
All right, come on. Step up.
The $1 sensation.

701
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,756
You wanna keep counting?

702
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,591
What's the matter with you, boy?

703
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:17,051
$50 ain't good enough for you?

704
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:19,220
That ain't $50. Keep counting.

705
00:39:19,803 --> 00:39:23,098
I guess you want charity, since
that record of yours ain't selling.

706
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:27,645
Get him off my back!

707
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,109
Break it up!

708
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:35,945
What the hell's going on in here?

709
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:39,323
The blind sensation don't like
the money I'm trying to pay him!

710
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:40,449
He's cheating me! I quit!

711
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,201
Oh, you lying son of a bitch!

712
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:44,620
Don't be fighting nobody
that can see!

713
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:47,414
Listen, I ain't runnnin' around
lookin' for singles for this chump!

714
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:48,582
There's $50 here, Ray.

715
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:49,625
You see that, fool?

716
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:52,545
Shut up, Wilbur! Ray, from now on,
I'll handle your pay myself.

717
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:53,587
I'm tired of this!

718
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,422
I'll tell Jack to
find you somebody else!

719
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:56,715
You sure? It's cold out there.

720
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,801
Don't worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

721
00:39:58,884 --> 00:40:01,053
- Ray!
- Damn it, Wilbur!

722
00:40:01,136 --> 00:40:02,137
Let him go!

723
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:03,722
What we gonna do now?

724
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:15,234
"After the death of Moses, the
Lord spake unto Joshua saying:

725
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:17,695
Moses my servant is dead.

726
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:20,239
Now therefore arise.
Go over to Jordan.

727
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:21,448
Be not afraid,

728
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:23,617
For the Lord thy God is with thee."

729
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,160
Mr. Charles.

730
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:26,996
Who is it?

731
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,789
Mr. Charles,
my name is Ahmet Ertegun.

732
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:30,457
May I have a moment of your time?

733
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:36,088
What do you want, man?
I'm at church.

734
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,465
I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

735
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:40,634
You're here now. What do you want?

736
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:44,054
My company, Atlantic Records,
has acquired ...

737
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:46,307
your contract from Swing Time.

738
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,517
I'd like to discuss your future.

739
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:51,437
Hold on. Don't jive me now.
I ain't for sale.

740
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:53,147
May I sit down?

741
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:57,776
You see, Mr. Charles,

742
00:40:58,485 --> 00:41:00,613
Jack Lauderdale has found himself,

743
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:02,865
shall we say, a little overextended,

744
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:06,118
and has had to
unload some of his talent.

745
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:08,162
When your name
came up, I jumped at ...

746
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:10,164
the chance to work with you.
I'm a big fan.

747
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:12,124
What if I want to go
to another company?

748
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:14,627
There's a guy out there right now
that is willing to pay me ...

749
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,046
seven cents a record.
Can you do that?

750
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:20,216
Man, I could promise you
15 cents a record,

751
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:24,511
but you won't get it any more
than he'll pay you seven.

752
00:41:26,263 --> 00:41:29,391
What I will do is promise you
five cents a record ...

753
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,894
and pay you five cents
a record.

754
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:35,898
If you think pennies,
Mr. Charles, you get pennies.

755
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,526
You think dollars,

756
00:41:39,527 --> 00:41:41,111
you get dollars.

757
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:45,866
I like how you put
things together, man.

758
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,868
Ahem, you know what?

759
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:50,871
Omelet, you're all right with me.

760
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:52,498
- Ahmet.
- Ahmet.

761
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:53,749
What kind of name is that?

762
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,042
I'm Turkish.

763
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,335
Well, you know what?

764
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:59,296
I guess Jack Lauderdale's bad
luck is my good fortune.

765
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:02,508
I knew that Atlantic Records
was bigger than Swing Time.

766
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:05,135
You guys do good music.
I dig Atlantic.

767
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:06,679
You could have fooled me.

768
00:42:06,762 --> 00:42:09,431
Well, you know, I gotta keep
my eye on you city boys.

769
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:11,851
Down home,
we call it "country dumb."

770
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,813

He just don't get it.

You either sound original,
or you got nothin'.

Ahmet, what'd you think of that?

790
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:21,462
Ray, I want to tell you something,
and I don't want you to take it wrong.

00:43:21,545 --> 00:43:22,838
Then give it to me right.

792
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:26,342
I signed you because I sensed
something special in you ...

793
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:29,595
not because you sound like
Nat Cole or Charles Brown.

794
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:31,513
I thought you like what I do.

795
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:33,516
We ... we love the timbre
of your voice,

796
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:35,809
we like your virtuosity,
your energy ...

797
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:37,144
But not my music.

798
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:38,646
Come on, man, I didn't say that.

799
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:41,148
Ahmet, this is what I do, man.

800
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:43,359
I gotta make a living.
This is what the people want.

801
00:43:43,442 --> 00:43:45,027
I don't know no other way.

802
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,862
We got to help you find one.

803
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:49,240
Look, let's try a little
change of pace, okay?

804
00:43:49,323 --> 00:43:50,699
You're familiar with stride piano?

805
00:43:50,783 --> 00:43:54,078
You kidding me, man? The man who I
learned the piano from is a stride player.

806
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:57,164
Okay, I got a song.
It's called "The Mess Around".

807
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,083
"The Mess Around."
Cute title. Who wrote it?

808
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,543
I did.

809
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:02,211
Ah, you wrote it.

810
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:03,295
Yeah.

811
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:05,047
Well, sing it to me, man.

812
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:06,507
- Sing it?
- Yeah.

813
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,217
It ain't like
I can read the lyrics.

814
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,886
Okay.
Well, it's the key of G.

815
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,388
Okay. Key of G.

816
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:14,515
Uh-huh.

817
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:16,350
Yeah.

818
00:44:16,517 --> 00:44:19,353
Yeah, but it's a kind of
Pete Johnson thing.

819
00:44:19,436 --> 00:44:20,813
Pete Johnson.

820
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:24,275
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

821
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,443
You like that?

00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:30,174
That's all right there.

843
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:32,968
What do you think, Ahmet?

844
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,053
Great, Ray!

845
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:35,262
Unbelievable!

846
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:36,430
Who's that?

847
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:39,642
Ray, I want you to meet
my new partner, Jerry.

848
00:45:39,725 --> 00:45:41,268
Mr. Ray Charles, Jerry Wexler.

849
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:42,353
Hey.

850
00:45:42,436 --> 00:45:45,481
Don't worry, Ray. I'm going to
step back, I'm gonna watch,

851
00:45:45,564 --> 00:45:47,983
I'm gonna learn how to produce
a record. I'm in awe.

852
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:49,276
That was out of sight.

853
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,153
That's some running
and riffing, man!

854
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:53,155
Well, this'll make you shout, man.

855
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:03,999
We're listening to that
new recording, Mess Around ...

856
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,377
by Atlantic recording artist,
Ray Charles.

857
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,964
And we have the gentleman
live here in the KCOH studios.

858
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:13,092
So, Ray, when you're not making your
own music, what do you listen to?

859
00:46:13,175 --> 00:46:16,845
You know what, the fact is, King Bee,
I really and truly love gospel.

860
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:19,807
One of my favorite groups
is from right here in Houston:

861
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,725
The Cecil Shaw Singers.

862
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:25,479
You heard it: Ray Charles endorses
Houston's own Cecil Shaw.

863
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:27,481
We'll be playing
gospel all day Sunday ...

864
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:29,233
but right now,
let's hear some more ...

865
00:46:29,316 --> 00:46:30,943
of that Mess Around
by Ray Charles.

866
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:32,361
K.B., line 1.

867
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:36,073
King Bee.

868
00:46:37,783 --> 00:46:38,784
Mmm-hmm.

869
00:46:39,785 --> 00:46:41,453
Yeah, he's right here.

870
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,665
Miss Della Antwine
of the Cecil Shaw Singers.

871
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:49,962
Hello, Miss Antwine.

872
00:46:50,379 --> 00:46:53,132
You sung tenor in
Jesus Is My Shepherd, right?

873
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:54,425
Yes.

874
00:46:55,259 --> 00:46:57,011
How did you pick me out?

875
00:46:57,094 --> 00:47:00,055
Actually,
I ... I hear like you see.

876
00:47:00,806 --> 00:47:03,851
Like that hummingbird outside
the window, for instance.

877
00:47:10,065 --> 00:47:11,317
I can't hear her.

878
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,651
You have to listen.

879
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:31,754
Yes.

880
00:47:31,837 --> 00:47:32,838
Yeah.

881
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,256
Yes, you can.

882
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,382
OH-OH.

883
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:36,425
You hear that?

884
00:47:36,508 --> 00:47:37,551
What?

885
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:40,429
Her heart just skipped a beat.

886
00:47:42,681 --> 00:47:44,558
Oh, did you like my record?

887
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,228
The one that King Bee was playin'?

888
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,272
It was very nice.

889
00:47:50,523 --> 00:47:52,733
Different than the others.

890
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:55,236
I've heard a lot of your music.

891
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,862
Was it very nice, too?

892
00:47:56,946 --> 00:47:59,198
Look, Miss Antwine, if you
don't really like the record,

893
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:02,660
you ain't got to beat around the bush
with me. I mean, my mama never did.

894
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:05,037
It's not that I don't
enjoy your music.

895
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,456
It's just that I feel
I've heard it before.

896
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:10,042
I keep wondering what the
real Ray Charles sound like.

897
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:11,585
Ray Charles? Who's he?

898
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,587
Nobody, if you don't know.

899
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:14,630
Huh?

900
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:17,925
Sorry. I should have
kept my mouth shut.

901
00:48:18,008 --> 00:48:20,177
Oh, no, no.
Then you wouldn't be you.

902
00:48:21,387 --> 00:48:23,806
You know, it's not like
I haven't heard that before.

903
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:27,184
I guess I just, uh, never
really listened, that's all.

904
00:48:29,395 --> 00:48:32,356
Ain't nobody ever put
it that sweet, I guess.

905
00:48:49,582 --> 00:48:51,500
You know what,
Miss Della Bea Antwine?

906
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:53,669
You really are a country girl.
You know that?

907
00:48:53,752 --> 00:48:55,713
Yes.
How'd you know?

908
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:57,840
I could tell by
the way you ordered.

909
00:48:57,923 --> 00:49:00,092
"Let me get molasses
with my cornbread."

910
00:49:01,343 --> 00:49:03,012
Were you raised on a farm?

911
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:05,931
My mother did a little
sharecropping in Florida.

912
00:49:06,015 --> 00:49:07,474
Is she still there?

913
00:49:07,558 --> 00:49:10,394
God bless her heart, she passed
away when I went to school.

914
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:11,979
Ray, I'm sorry.

915
00:49:12,438 --> 00:49:14,148
She never was real healthy.

916
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:16,775
She just worked herself
to death, poor thing.

917
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,653
That's why she didn't want me
carrying around no tin cup.

918
00:49:19,737 --> 00:49:21,447
The kids I went to school with,

919
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,200
they were doing basket-weavin'
and wickerwork.

920
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:27,369
But not you. Because of your gift.

921
00:49:27,494 --> 00:49:29,121
Because of my ears.

922
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:31,332
See, I can mimic
damn near anybody,

923
00:49:31,415 --> 00:49:34,084
and I ... I ... I ... I make
a pretty decent living at it.

924
00:49:34,168 --> 00:49:36,212
It's just, if I
change my style up ...

925
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:37,838
and people really don't dig it,

926
00:49:37,922 --> 00:49:40,174
I mean, what am I
left with, you know?

927
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:42,760
I mean, when you're blind,
Miss Antwine,

928
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:45,012
you ain't got that many choices.

929
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:48,724
Seem to me like you got all
the choices in the world.

930
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:51,727
God gave you the gift to sound ...

931
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:54,063
like anybody you please,
even yourself.

932
00:49:55,814 --> 00:49:58,025
We're here. This is where I live.

933
00:49:59,151 --> 00:50:00,986
Well, you think
the preacher'd let me in?

934
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,405
I mean, uh, I'm a sinner,
but I need a little prayer.

935
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:05,950
His wife don't like
me having male company.

936
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:09,203
Well, tell him there's
a soul out here that needs savin'.

937
00:50:09,954 --> 00:50:13,374
You know what, Miss Antwine,
you really got me thinkin'.

938
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:16,669
About what?

939
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:20,089
About my life. About my music.

940
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:23,717
About everything.

941
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,431
Ray, don't ... don't you think
we're movin' a little fast?

942
00:50:31,392 --> 00:50:33,143
Listen, I'm ... I'm gonna
go to New York ...

943
00:50:33,227 --> 00:50:35,729
for a couple of weeks,
and when I get back,

944
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:38,607
you can take it as
slow as you want.

945
00:50:41,277 --> 00:50:43,112
All right, Mr. Charles.

946
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:46,240
All right, Miss Antwine.

947
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:48,284
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

948
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:50,369
Well, hold on, now.
Let me call you a cab.

949
00:50:50,452 --> 00:50:52,121
I got it. Three blocks up,

950
00:50:52,204 --> 00:50:54,915
left for two, right for one.

951
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:56,709
Fifteen giant steps,

952
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:58,711
and I'm at the
Crystal White Hotel. Hello.

953
00:51:05,968 --> 00:51:08,554
"Mess Around" was
a positive step for us, Ray.

954
00:51:08,637 --> 00:51:09,763
We're making progress.

955
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:11,974
Oh, come on, Ahmet.
Now, you've been nice to me.

956
00:51:12,057 --> 00:51:13,809
But I haven't given
you guys any hits.

957
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:15,436
Atlantic Records
has been good to me,

958
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,229
but if you want me to do
something special,

959
00:51:17,313 --> 00:51:18,647
I'm gonna need my own band.

960
00:51:19,148 --> 00:51:22,359
Oh, man. Taking a band out on
the road costs a mint, Ray.

961
00:51:22,443 --> 00:51:25,487
I mean, even Joe Morris is struggling.
His band's had a hit record.

962
00:51:25,571 --> 00:51:27,406
But, Ahmet, listen,
I'm not Joe Morris.

963
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:29,742
Man, you told me if I think
pennies, I get pennies.

964
00:51:29,825 --> 00:51:31,702
I'm thinking dollars, man.

965
00:51:33,037 --> 00:51:35,873
Ruth Brown's got
a tour booked in Georgia.

966
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:38,209
She needs a band.

967
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:39,293
I ... I'll take it.

968
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:42,129
I could write the charts
for her, I ... I could do backup,

969
00:51:42,213 --> 00:51:44,256
and also be an openin' act.

970
00:51:47,218 --> 00:51:48,552
Okay.

971
00:51:48,677 --> 00:51:50,930
But you're going to be
financially responsible.

972
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:52,932
You're gonna have
to make it work, Ray.

973
00:51:53,015 --> 00:51:55,518
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna make it
do what it do, baby.

974
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:56,977
Yeah.

975
00:52:09,114 --> 00:52:10,115
Ray!

976
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:12,785
Miss Antwine, it's been two weeks.

977
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:14,578
It's been three.

978
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:22,711
Now, where's the preacher at?
And the wife?

979
00:52:22,836 --> 00:52:24,922
They in Dallas till Monday.

980
00:52:25,005 --> 00:52:26,757
Well, hallelujah!

981
00:52:36,976 --> 00:52:38,394
Della Bea.

982
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:41,063
Kind of like a honey bee, right?

983
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:46,652
Can I call you Bea?

984
00:52:47,653 --> 00:52:49,947
Yeah, I'd like that.

985
00:52:52,825 --> 00:52:56,662
There's only been two cats that
I ever really trusted in my life.

986
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:01,417
There's Jeff Brown, he's going
to be my tour manager,

987
00:53:02,293 --> 00:53:04,587
Fathead Newman, my tenor man ...

988
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:08,257
and now you.

989
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:17,349
But you gotta do me a favor.

990
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:19,518
Bea, you gotta
always tell me the truth.

991
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:21,729
Oh, yeah.
Just like you did before.

992
00:53:22,605 --> 00:53:25,566
Don't feel sorry for me
just 'cause I'm blind.

993
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:29,195
How could I pity
someone I admire?

994
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,701
Can I play something for you?

995
00:53:35,784 --> 00:53:37,369
- Now?
- Yeah.

996
00:53:37,453 --> 00:53:38,579
No, Ray.

997
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:40,581
Yeah, right now.
Right now. I'm gonna ...

998
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:41,790
Ray!

999
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:47,546
It's right there.
You got it.

1000
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:48,839
Okay.

1001
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:50,132
Yeah, yeah, this will work.

1002
00:53:51,342 --> 00:53:53,636
Now you go ahead and play.
I'm gonna close these drapes.

1003
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:54,720
All right.

1004
00:53:54,803 --> 00:53:56,305

I know what it is.
I wrote it.

1022
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:30,172
I mean, you told me
to find my own voice.

1023

Well, Bea, this is it.

1024

But it ... it ain't ... It ain't right

are we gonna tell Ray?

1043
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:33,027
We just have
to tell him the truth:

1044
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,904
Ruth Brown's pregnant,
so there's no tour.

1045
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:36,739
What about LaVern Baker?

1046
00:55:36,864 --> 00:55:38,866
Get LaVern Baker to take the tour.

1047
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:41,118
She doesn't have a record.
There's nothing to promote.

1048
00:55:41,202 --> 00:55:43,370
You and Jesse get up there,
write a couple of songs,

1049
00:55:43,412 --> 00:55:44,830
let's get her in the studio.

1050
00:55:44,914 --> 00:55:46,582
It's gonna take
a month to do that ...

1051
00:55:46,665 --> 00:55:48,626
What are we gonna do?
We got to do somethin'.

1052
00:55:48,709 --> 00:55:50,377
Ray's got a whole
new band up there.

1053
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:52,755
How the hell did he put
together a band so fast?

1054
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:55,257
Boss! Boss, they're here.

1055

so we can show 'em this.

... break this to Ray.

1057

00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:12,501
Ray, It was
Milt's dad, Billy,

1090
00:57:12,543 --> 00:57:15,170
who first drew my attention
to a certain blind pianist ...

1091
00:57:15,212 --> 00:57:17,214
when he was
booking Lowell Fulson.

Ray Charles.
We believe in your talent.

1093
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,386
We wanna be

1094
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:24,889
We've already got you
booked on a 10-city tour ...

1095
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:26,473

1096
00:57:26,515 --> 00:57:27,725
Oh, Roy Milton, I love him.

1097
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:30,686
... and Tangula,
the Exotic Shake Dancer.

1098
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:33,439
She is gorgeous.

1099
00:57:33,564 --> 00:57:34,857
Ray, I gotta tell you,

1100
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,443
we think you're onto
something very big here.

1101
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:40,613
Nobody's ever combined
R&B and gospel before.

1102
00:57:40,696 --> 00:57:42,072
"I've Got A Woman" is a smash.

1103
00:57:42,156 --> 00:57:44,992
You better start thinking about a
follow-up, my friend. Right now.

1104
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:47,203
You know, this sounds good.
I gotta run to Texas ...

1105
00:57:47,286 --> 00:57:49,872
and take care of some business,
and, I'll be right back.

1106
00:57:49,955 --> 00:57:52,541
Well, make it fast.
I'm ready to sell, sell, sell.

00:57:52,625 --> 00:57:55,878
A-a-as long as you book
me in front of Tangula.

1108
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:57,713
Della, hold on!
Let me get my camera.

1109
00:57:57,796 --> 00:57:59,131
Let me get one picture.

1110
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:01,383
Y'all, y'all,
stay right there! Ray!

1111
00:58:02,343 --> 00:58:03,969
Della, let me get one picture!

1112
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:06,055
Come on. One picture, Della!
Come on, now.

1113
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:08,516
Be careful, Ray.

1114
00:58:08,557 --> 00:58:10,226
These are your last steps
of freedom, man.

1115
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:11,602
Don't open that door.

1116
00:58:11,685 --> 00:58:14,522
Ray, you gotta carry her
over the threshold.

1117
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:24,406
To the right, Ray!
To the right, now!

1118
00:58:27,576 --> 00:58:29,328
Ray, you need some help?

1119
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:31,247

what you're doing?

Ray.

Can I come in?

1126
00:58:50,474 --> 00:58:52,059
H-H-Hold on.

1127
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:53,769
What's goin' on, Ray?

1128
00:58:58,023 --> 00:58:59,692
Open this door.

1129
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:02,778
Why are you locking doors
on me, Ray?

1130
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:05,197
You know the place is small.

1131
00:59:05,281 --> 00:59:06,657
We gotta have a little privacy.

1132
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,159
Uh, what we need is
a little more room.

1133
00:59:09,243 --> 00:59:12,496
You know, we're gonna need some
space while we start a family.

1134
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:16,959
Well, Bea, you know I'm gonna be
on the road for most of the year.

1135
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,002
Ray.

1136
00:59:19,336 --> 00:59:22,381
I'm just thinking, what if
I'm not a good father?

1137
00:59:22,923 --> 00:59:24,466
My daddy was never around.

1138
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,719
And he had 3 different families.

1139
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:29,930
Well you,

are gonna have one,

1141

Right now?

1142
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:36,312
Mmm-hmm.

1143
00:59:37,188 --> 00:59:38,606
Well, what do you think?

1144
00:59:39,815 --> 00:59:40,774

01:00:19,855 --> 01:00:20,898
Stop all this stuff!

1154
01:00:20,981 --> 01:00:22,024
You need to be saved!

1155
01:00:22,107 --> 01:00:23,442
I can't take it no more.
Stop it!

1156
01:00:23,526 --> 01:00:24,568
I can't take it!

1157
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:26,362
Hold on.
Now, wait a minute, man.

1158
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:27,780
Take your hands off me!

1159
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:29,532
This ain't right!

1160
01:00:29,698 --> 01:00:32,076
Just let the people
hear the music.

1161
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:35,329
Y'all sitting here,
listenin' to this devil!

1162
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:38,541
You're just givin' your money
to Satan, that's what you're doin'.

1163
01:00:38,624 --> 01:00:40,584
Hold on, y — you got a problem?

1164
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:42,253
Yeah, I got a problem!

1165
01:00:42,336 --> 01:00:44,171
That's gospel you're singin'!

1166
01:00:44,255 --> 01:00:46,340
You're turning
God's music into sex.

1167
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:48,425
You're making money off the Lord!

1168
01:00:48,509 --> 01:00:51,345
Don't y'all smile at me!
All of y'all are in it, too!

1169
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:53,472
All of y'all are
going straight to hell!

1170
01:00:53,556 --> 01:00:54,557
She's right.

1171
01:00:56,267 --> 01:00:57,434
No, this here's wrong.

1172
01:00:57,518 --> 01:00:58,727
The whole thing's wrong.

1173
01:00:59,895 --> 01:01:01,730
It's okay. It's okay.
Let ... let him go.

1174
01:01:02,898 --> 01:01:04,692
You got a right to believe
in what you believe.

1175
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:06,902
You can go
to hell by yourself!

1176
01:01:06,986 --> 01:01:08,529
Boss, you want
to cancel the show?

1177
01:01:08,612 --> 01:01:09,947
Uh, no. I'm not gonna
cancel the show.

1178
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:11,574
Just find me
a bari player by tomorrow.

1179
01:01:11,657 --> 01:01:14,034
I just want to ask
the folks right now:

1180
01:01:14,076 --> 01:01:17,079
If all of y'all want me to keep
playing, let me hear you say "Amen."

1181
01:01:17,162 --> 01:01:19,164
Amen!

1182
01:01:19,248 --> 01:01:21,041
And while you're at it,
find me a girl ...

1183
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,668
with church-training
that can sing ...

1184
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:23,919
but without the church attitude.

1185
01:01:23,961 --> 01:01:25,045
All right.

1186
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:26,922
Let's go, y'all.
Keep it going, here we go ...

1187
01:01:26,964 --> 01:01:28,591
Come on.

1188
01:01:35,556 --> 01:01:37,558
♪ Let me tell you
'bout a girl I know ♪

1189
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:40,811
♪ She is my baby
and she lives next door ♪

1190
01:01:45,649 --> 01:01:47,109
Ray, you got your watch?

1191
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:48,194
Yeah.

1192
01:01:48,277 --> 01:01:51,906
Good. All right, baby,
your blue shirts are on top,

1193
01:01:51,947 --> 01:01:55,409
the pants in between, and the
white shirts are on the bottom.

1194
01:01:55,784 --> 01:01:58,454
Here's your glasses.
There you go.

1195
01:02:00,122 --> 01:02:01,123
Bea.

1196
01:02:01,624 --> 01:02:03,918
Why don't you come,
go on the road with us?

1197
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:06,086
Look, baby, what would
I do on the road?

1198
01:02:06,128 --> 01:02:08,505
You'd do what I say you do,
that's what you're gonna do.

1199
01:02:09,673 --> 01:02:13,469
I've been trying to get a female
voice in the band, anyway.

1200
01:02:13,511 --> 01:02:16,347
Can't you just picture me
wobbling around on that stage,

1201
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,640
big as a house?

1202
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:19,725
Well, I can't picture you,
you know that.

1203
01:02:19,808 --> 01:02:21,268
But I know what I can do.

1204
01:02:22,978 --> 01:02:25,731
Come on, now. Don't start
nothing you can't finish.

1205
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:27,233
Jeff is waiting.

1206
01:02:28,692 --> 01:02:30,903
You know I can't go
on the road with you,

1207
01:02:30,986 --> 01:02:32,446
not with your baby inside me.

1208
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:33,572
Mmm-hmm.

1209
01:02:33,656 --> 01:02:35,616
I'm gonna get your shaving kit.

1210
01:02:36,617 --> 01:02:38,452
Uh, Bea,
I ... I got it.

1211
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:40,704
Bea, hold ... hold on.

1212
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:46,669
Bea, let me get it.

1213
01:02:47,711 --> 01:02:50,297
How long you been
hiding this from me?

1214
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:52,716
Ray!

1215
01:02:54,176 --> 01:02:55,511
I'm your wife!

1216
01:02:55,594 --> 01:02:57,471
Bea, I ... I was just so
excited to see you.

1217
01:02:57,555 --> 01:02:59,849
I forgot to leave it back there
with the band, that's all.

1218
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:01,225
Let me ... Let me get it.

1219
01:03:01,308 --> 01:03:03,519
Oh, it's just a little medicine,
that's all, baby.

1220
01:03:03,602 --> 01:03:05,020
That ain't medicine to nobody, Ray.

1221
01:03:05,104 --> 01:03:06,480
Don't be lyin' to yourself.

1222
01:03:06,564 --> 01:03:08,148
It ain't like I'm
dealing it, baby.

1223
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,692
I just use it
to get a little taste.

1224
01:03:09,775 --> 01:03:11,527
You don't taste poison, Ray.
It kills you.

1225
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,653
Now, you got to stop.

1226
01:03:12,736 --> 01:03:14,864
I ain't got to do
a goddamn thing!

1227
01:03:16,448 --> 01:03:19,076
What about me?
What about your baby?

1228
01:03:19,743 --> 01:03:20,744
Bea.

1229
01:03:21,036 --> 01:03:23,205
It ain't like I'm new to this.

1230
01:03:23,747 --> 01:03:26,417
If I felt like this was
jeopardizing my music, or you,

1231
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,877
or providing for that baby,

1232
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,087
I would stop in a minute.
But I know it won't.

1233
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,673
How do you know that, Ray?
How do ... How do you know that?

1234
01:03:32,756 --> 01:03:35,217
You know what? You can talk till
you're blue in the face,

1235
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:36,969
it don't matter.
I'm not gonna stop.

1236
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:38,012
Then I'm comin' with you.

1237
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:39,013
No, no.

1238
01:03:39,054 --> 01:03:40,139
Well, Ray, you just said ...

1239
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:41,849
No. No.
You know what it is, Bea.

1240
01:03:41,891 --> 01:03:43,809
I ... I think
it's like you said.

1241
01:03:44,226 --> 01:03:47,563
I don't think that the road
is a place for you and the baby.

1242
01:03:50,149 --> 01:03:51,984
What are you saying to me, Ray?

1243
01:03:52,067 --> 01:03:54,236
What I'm sayin' is
that when I get home,

1244
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,655
I hope that you're
here at my house.

1245
01:03:58,407 --> 01:03:59,742

1246
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,123
Jeff, come get this bag.

1247
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:07,708
All right, Ray.

1248

01:05:11,438 --> 01:05:12,565
Mary Ann Fisher.

1263
01:05:12,648 --> 01:05:14,108
Uh, Mary Ann, how would you feel ...

1264
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:16,652
if I asked you to sing a torch
song with a gospel feel to it?

1265
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:20,322
Well, Gospel's all about
love anyway, isn't it?

1266
01:05:20,364 --> 01:05:21,365
Oh, yeah.

1267
01:05:21,448 --> 01:05:24,451
Would it make you
feel like a sinner?

1268
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:28,289
Well, Mr. Charles,
I love the Lord, the Lord loves me.

1269
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,832
But I ain't no hypocrite.

1270
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:34,295
Hello. You know what?
It's hard to fool me,

1271
01:05:34,378 --> 01:05:37,506
but it's impossible to fool
the Almighty, ain't it?

1272
01:05:37,882 --> 01:05:40,176
Why don't we rehearse
the song a little bit?

1273
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:41,302
Okay.

1274
01:05:41,343 --> 01:05:43,888
Boss, we got to go.

1275
01:05:43,971 --> 01:05:46,098
Go ahead. I'll be
with you in a minute.

1276
01:05:46,182 --> 01:05:48,350
I just really feel your ...
feel your spirit.

1277
01:05:48,434 --> 01:05:50,019
Boss, are you sure?

1278
01:05:53,731 --> 01:05:54,899

Uh, come sit next to me.

1289
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,834
So, what do you think?

1290
01:07:13,143 --> 01:07:14,687
Ray, telephone.

1291
01:07:15,062 --> 01:07:16,438
Take a message.

1292
01:07:18,232 --> 01:07:19,775
It's Della Bea.

1293
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:21,735
Damn it.

1294
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:24,071
Uh, tell her I'm busy.

1295
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:26,991
Come on, man,
I ain't lying to Bea.

1296
01:07:27,783 --> 01:07:29,118
Uh-oh.

1297
01:07:29,285 --> 01:07:30,452
Is that the wife?

1298
01:07:30,536 --> 01:07:31,912
Shut up.

1299
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,584
I-I'll be there in a second.

1300
01:07:39,336 --> 01:07:41,255
Don't mess with
this junk, all right?

1301
01:07:41,297 --> 01:07:43,299
All it'll do is make you sick.

1302
01:07:47,386 --> 01:07:49,972
Does he have all
his fingers and toes?

1303
01:07:50,472 --> 01:07:51,974
Yes, he does.

1304
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:57,730
Can he, uh ...

1305
01:08:01,483 --> 01:08:02,985
Can he see?

1306
01:08:04,653 --> 01:08:05,738
Yes.

1307
01:08:08,782 --> 01:08:10,284
You want to hold him?

1308
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:11,660
No, I can't.

1309
01:08:11,702 --> 01:08:12,703
Come on, Ray.

1310
01:08:12,786 --> 01:08:14,288
I wouldn't know
what to do it right.

1311
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:15,998
That's what you came here for.

1312
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:18,334
Use this hand to hold his head.

1313
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:21,253
Okay. Right there.

1314
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:33,057
That's your daddy.

1315
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:34,350
Yeah.

1316
01:08:36,185 --> 01:08:39,063
He ain't no bigger
than a loaf of bread.

1317
01:08:39,772 --> 01:08:41,065
Thank you.

1318
01:08:41,857 --> 01:08:44,026
He's not my gift to you, Ray.

1319
01:08:44,318 --> 01:08:45,736
He's your son.

1320
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:49,657
You know I'm gonna take care of
both of you. You know that, right?

1321
01:08:52,201 --> 01:08:53,702
I love you.

1322
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:56,872
I love you, too, Ray.

1323
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:59,083
But there's
something I got to say.

1324
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:02,336
I know you're a musician,
a working musician,

1325
01:09:02,378 --> 01:09:05,005
but don't bring the road
into our home again.

1326
01:09:05,089 --> 01:09:07,842
The home I'm making
for you and our children.

1327
01:09:07,883 --> 01:09:10,135
Bea, I ... I promise
I won't do that.

1328
01:09:10,386 --> 01:09:11,887
It ... It's just there's
some things ...

1329
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:14,014
No. Now, don't say no more.

1330
01:09:14,306 --> 01:09:16,058
I ain't no fool.

1331
01:09:16,684 --> 01:09:19,061
You know, you're
the only woman I'll ever love.

1332
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:34,869
Mama! Mama, help!

1333
01:09:35,244 --> 01:09:39,790
Mama, help!
Mama, help, please!

1334
01:09:40,082 --> 01:09:42,084
I need you!

1335
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,550
Mama, help!

1336
01:09:51,177 --> 01:09:52,469
Mama!

1337
01:11:44,373 --> 01:11:48,377
I hear you, too, Mama.
You're right there.

1338
01:11:55,885 --> 01:11:57,887
Yeah, yes, I am.

1339
01:12:01,223 --> 01:12:02,892
Why are you crying, Mama?

1340
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:04,393
'Cause I'm happy.

1341
01:12:08,564 --> 01:12:10,399
Hey, it's Uncle Jeff!

1342
01:12:10,482 --> 01:12:12,568
Got my camera!

1343
01:12:12,651 --> 01:12:14,737
Sarah! Sarah! Come on in.

1344
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,572
Put the flowers
right there behind them.

1345
01:12:16,655 --> 01:12:18,782
All right, big smiles,
everybody. Big smiles.

more to do in the show, huh?

01:14:06,849 --> 01:14:08,184
How about a solo?

1378
01:14:08,225 --> 01:14:09,894
You just don't stop, do you?

1379
01:14:10,269 --> 01:14:12,605
Look, I'm going up to New York
to do some publicity.

1380
01:14:12,688 --> 01:14:14,857
You take a week off and stay here,
find some material,

1381
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,026
and when I get back,
we can talk about it.

I dig New York, man.

1385
01:14:41,091 --> 01:14:43,260
It's like everybody here's
making their own sound.

1386
01:14:43,344 --> 01:14:45,095
They loved it.
Ray, they loved you.

1387
01:14:45,179 --> 01:14:46,889
We're gonna
get the cover of Billboard.

1388
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:50,017
You know what, I want to do a session
while I'm here. How about tomorrow?

1389
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,227
What, you got the band here?

Yeah. I've got the band here
Step down.

I need a different background.

1392
01:14:56,065 --> 01:14:58,776
You know what I'm sayin', I've been
hearing this thing in my head,

1393
01:14:58,859 --> 01:15:00,945
kind of like a dance
between a man and three women.

1394
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:02,863
Sounds fun. Can I watch?

1395
01:15:02,905 --> 01:15:04,532
It's a dance of voices, Ahmet.

Like three Mary Anns?

Oh, no, no, no.
That's too smooth.

01:15:55,624 --> 01:15:57,751
Maybe we should
sign these girls up.

1420
01:15:58,294 --> 01:16:00,296
If I know Ray,
we won't get a chance.

1440
01:16:41,086 --> 01:16:42,338
Yeah, you know what,
I love it!

1441
01:16:42,379 --> 01:16:43,839
We gonna put it out
just like that.

1442
01:16:43,923 --> 01:16:46,425
You know, I never got a record
in one take before!

You Cookies sound sweet.
Mmm-hmm.

1444
01:16:48,385 --> 01:16:50,846
When it's happening, baby,
I mean, it just feels right.

1445
01:16:50,888 --> 01:16:53,766
I know what you mean. I got the
shivers in this studio tonight.

1446
01:16:53,849 --> 01:16:56,143
That's 'cause they ain't
paid the heating bill.

1447
01:16:56,185 --> 01:16:58,312
I have a question for
all of you:

1448
01:16:58,354 --> 01:17:00,898
How would you like to
go on the road with me?

1449
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,653
Wait ... wait. How, um,
how much you gonna pay us?

1450
01:17:05,694 --> 01:17:07,488
You know, Ahmet takes care
of all of that.

1451
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:09,406
Oh, what, you mean
he don't listen to you?

1452
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,991
Yeah, you better know he does.

1453
01:17:11,283 --> 01:17:14,203
Look, don't worry about it. Brother
Ray'll take care of all of you.

1454
01:17:14,245 --> 01:17:17,373
Well, my mama taught me to
take care of myself, honey.

1455
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,250
Is your mother here?

1456
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:21,043
No, she's not,
but I speak for us.

1457
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,169
No, you don't.

1458
01:17:22,211 --> 01:17:26,340
Okay, Speak for Us, how about,
uh, ahem, $20 a week?

1459
01:17:26,382 --> 01:17:28,884
$20 a week is good.
We'll take $40. Each.

1460
01:17:29,009 --> 01:17:30,010
$40 each?

1461
01:17:30,094 --> 01:17:31,095
You heard me.

1462
01:17:31,178 --> 01:17:33,556
No, no, no.
Uh, how about $25?

1463
01:17:34,014 --> 01:17:35,474
We'll take $30.

1464
01:17:35,683 --> 01:17:38,227
I better say yeah before you
talk me out of my drawers.

1465
01:17:39,478 --> 01:17:40,980
$30 a week!

1466
01:17:41,063 --> 01:17:42,064
Uh, deal?

1467
01:17:42,147 --> 01:17:43,482
Oh! Yeah.

1468
01:17:43,732 --> 01:17:45,860
- Oh! Margie, right?
- Yeah.

1469
01:17:45,901 --> 01:17:47,695
Well, look, Margie,
from now on, you guys ...

1470
01:17:47,736 --> 01:17:49,488
are going to be called:
"The Raelettes".

1471
01:17:49,572 --> 01:17:50,948
Raelettes?

1472
01:17:51,031 --> 01:17:52,992
Does that mean
we have to "Let Ray"?

1473
01:17:53,075 --> 01:17:54,869
Oh, Lord! What am I going
to do with you?

1474
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:56,579
I'm sure you'll think
of somethin'.

1475
01:17:58,831 --> 01:18:00,082
$30 a week!

1476
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:02,668
We're going to be The Raelettes!

1477
01:18:25,524 --> 01:18:27,568
Fathead, come on,
you're on the clock.

1478
01:18:27,651 --> 01:18:29,320
Come on, Bob, you're late.

1479
01:18:30,446 --> 01:18:32,573
All right, hold on, Jeff.
Listen up.

1480
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:34,950
From now on, we're gonna sing,
uh, four-part harmony.

1481
01:18:34,992 --> 01:18:37,453
Ethel, I want you to sing,
uh, uh, alto.

1482
01:18:37,953 --> 01:18:41,415
Margie, you sing tenor.
Pat, soprano, and Mary Ann, bass.

1483
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:43,959
I ain't no bass. I'm a soprano.

1484
01:18:44,418 --> 01:18:45,794
I'll sing bass.

1485
01:18:45,878 --> 01:18:47,963
I mean, where we come from,
we can sing anything.

1486
01:18:48,047 --> 01:18:49,256
Mmm-hmm.

1487
01:18:49,298 --> 01:18:51,509
We're talking about singing,
sugar, not hog calling.

1488
01:18:51,592 --> 01:18:52,593
What?

1489
01:18:52,676 --> 01:18:53,969
Oh, that's cold.

1490
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:55,763

1491

Well, if the corncob fits ...

1492
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,475
You better shut your mouth
before you get ...

1493
01:18:59,517 --> 01:19:00,768
Wait a minute!
You stop now!

Hey, hey, hey!
What is all the cackling for?

1495
01:19:04,813 --> 01:19:08,192

It's just that this stuff ...

will take you places
that you don't want to go.

See, I want to share
that with you.

believe in Jesus!

Ray, I watch your show

Maybe because it's new to you.

every single word ...

1734
01:30:07,949 --> 01:30:09,951
Yeah, baby!
That's why I love y'all, man.

1735
01:30:10,034 --> 01:30:12,370
All right. What the hell?
It's Atlantic, right?

1736
01:30:12,454 --> 01:30:13,413
Atlantic!

1737
01:30:13,455 --> 01:30:14,664
We'll release it in the summer.

1738
01:30:14,747 --> 01:30:16,374
There's less censorship,
school's out.

1739
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,126
The kids are ready to kick loose.

1740
01:30:18,209 --> 01:30:19,961
Ha, okay!

1741
01:30:22,046 --> 01:30:25,383
Tom, let's see if we can cut
this pumpkin in two.

1742
01:30:25,467 --> 01:30:27,343
Show me what your
genius is all about.

1743
01:30:27,427 --> 01:30:28,678
You got it, boss.

1744
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:32,515
Yeah, that is it. You put one
on Side A, put another on Side B.

1745
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:33,933
Man, that sounds out of sight.

1746
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:35,059
How you feeling, Ray?

1747
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:36,644
I feel groovy, baby.

1748
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:39,439
- I'm talking about the junk.
- What?

1749
01:30:39,731 --> 01:30:41,483
It's starting to show.

1750
01:30:42,275 --> 01:30:43,777
You're scratching all the time.

1751
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:45,111
You can't sit still.

1752
01:30:45,945 --> 01:30:48,198
Hey, man, have I ever
missed a date?

1753
01:30:48,281 --> 01:30:49,991
No, you never have.

1754
01:30:50,074 --> 01:30:52,368
Who's the one who delivers
a record in one take, hmm?

1755
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:54,662
Ray, you deliver better
than anybody I know ...

1756
01:30:54,746 --> 01:30:57,165
but I'm not talking to you
as a businessman.

1757
01:30:57,248 --> 01:30:59,250
Now come on, listen to me.

1758
01:31:00,126 --> 01:31:01,961
I'm worried about you.

1759
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:05,882
As a friend, I'm telling you,
man, your slip is hanging.

1760
01:31:07,008 --> 01:31:08,426
"Your slip is hanging."

1761
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:11,930
You been hanging out with us
country boys too much, man.

1762
01:31:12,013 --> 01:31:15,475
Uh, don't worry about this, man.
If this monkey gets too heavy on my back,

1763
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:18,269
I'll get an organ grinder,
man, and put him to work.

Hello?

It's Margie, man.

1828

01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,753
Tom, this is
what I want you to do.

1889
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:38,298
We'll lay my vocals down
and finish the harmony parts.

1890
01:36:38,381 --> 01:36:40,884
Uh, how're we gonna do
the harmonies, Ray?

1891
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:42,010
You sent the girls home.

1892
01:36:42,093 --> 01:36:44,471
I know what I did with the girls.
Let me take care of that.

1893
01:36:44,512 --> 01:36:47,474
You just turn that eight-track on,
and I'll do the girls' parts myself.

1894
01:36:47,557 --> 01:36:50,477
And go out here somewhere and
find me an "Oh, Johnny" girl.

1895
01:36:50,852 --> 01:36:52,479
Uh, one minute.

1896
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,064
What the hell's an "Oh, Johnny" girl?

1897
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:56,775
I think I've got an idea.

1898
01:36:57,317 --> 01:37:01,070

1899

The sky's the limit, Ray.

1909
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:30,058
I got you a $5,000-a-night raise.

1910
01:37:30,308 --> 01:37:32,185
They're gonna up you to 15 per.

1911
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:33,728
Rehearsal in 10 minutes, guys.

1912
01:37:33,812 --> 01:37:35,563
Jeff, could you get
me some cigarettes?

1913
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:37,524
Okay, boss.

1914
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:41,402
15 per, huh?

1915
01:37:41,486 --> 01:37:45,657
You know, Ray, your contract with
ATLANTIC is expiring in four months.

1916
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:46,991
Yeah.

1917
01:37:47,075 --> 01:37:49,035
Yeah, I've got the contract with me.

1918
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,079
They're going to double my royalties.

1919
01:37:51,162 --> 01:37:53,081
Before we jump back in that pond,

1920
01:37:53,248 --> 01:37:55,416
I thought I'd find out
what else was out there.

1921
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:59,129
I had a very productive chat
with ABC-Paramount yesterday.

1922
01:37:59,254 --> 01:38:01,172
ABC? Who told you to do that, huh?

1923
01:38:01,256 --> 01:38:04,217
And you know, Atlantic is family,
just like the Shaw Agency.

1924
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:06,719
Ray, my job is to get you
the best deal possible.

1925
01:38:07,429 --> 01:38:09,389
ABC is very interested.

1926
01:38:09,431 --> 01:38:10,473
No.

1927
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:14,436
How interested?

1928
01:38:15,311 --> 01:38:20,233
How about a $50,000 advance
each year for three years?

1929
01:38:20,275 --> 01:38:22,360
You produce your own records.

1930
01:38:22,777 --> 01:38:25,280
They'll deduct recording costs
and give you ...

1931
01:38:25,655 --> 01:38:27,323
75 percent.

1932
01:38:30,994 --> 01:38:32,787
Ahmet and Jerry are
flying in tonight,

1933
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:37,748
so will you put them off until
I can talk things out with ABC?

1934
01:38:39,794 --> 01:38:42,297
Well, my mama said, ain't
nothing wrong with talking.

1935
01:38:43,423 --> 01:38:44,424
Hey, enough of the formalities.

1936
01:38:44,507 --> 01:38:46,426
Come on, let's go back
into the office, Ray.

1937
01:38:46,509 --> 01:38:47,552
I hope I can call you Ray.

1938
01:38:47,635 --> 01:38:49,095
I want you to be comfortable here.

1939
01:38:49,179 --> 01:38:52,223
Because I'll tell you something,
everything is gonna be better at ABC.

1940
01:38:52,307 --> 01:38:54,225
Moving from an indie label
to a major ...

1941
01:38:54,309 --> 01:38:55,935
means you can sell
a lot more records,

1942
01:38:55,977 --> 01:38:59,272
as well as attract much larger
crowds, both white and Negro.

1943
01:38:59,355 --> 01:39:02,942
Yeah, but Mr. Clark, you know,
I've been at Atlantic for so long,

1944
01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:07,781
I just want to give those guys a chance,
you know, to at least match the offer.

1945
01:39:07,822 --> 01:39:10,116
Mm-hmm. Oh, certainly, certainly.

1946
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,701
But, uh, I doubt they'll be able to.

1947
01:39:11,785 --> 01:39:13,745
We're giving you
a state-of-the-art deal here.

1948
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:17,207
Well, you know, since I'm producing my own
records, I was wondering if I could ...

1949
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:19,125
uh, own my masters, too.

1950
01:39:26,674 --> 01:39:27,675
Well,

1951
01:39:27,759 --> 01:39:29,969
Ray, we've ... we've never
done that before.

1952
01:39:30,053 --> 01:39:32,097
No record company has.

1953
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:36,935
Well, I think I'm going to have to have it
that way for me to leave Atlantic Records.

1954
01:39:45,777 --> 01:39:48,113
Ahmet believes
we're family here at Atlantic.

1955
01:39:48,196 --> 01:39:50,240
I believe we're family
here at Atlantic.

1956
01:39:50,323 --> 01:39:52,158
Obviously, you don't!

1957
01:39:52,617 --> 01:39:54,160
Ahmet wouldn't believe it.

1958
01:39:54,244 --> 01:39:55,787
You know what he said, Ray?

1959
01:39:55,870 --> 01:39:57,831
He said you would never
turn your back on us.

1960
01:39:57,914 --> 01:40:00,041
Never for a Schlockmeister
like Sam Clark!

1961
01:40:01,209 --> 01:40:03,294
That's rich.
Sam Clark's a corporate slug,

1962
01:40:03,378 --> 01:40:06,548
who wouldn't know the difference
between Earl Hines and Art Tatum!

1963
01:40:12,887 --> 01:40:14,931
We let you grow here, Ray.

1964
01:40:15,223 --> 01:40:18,893
And nobody's taking credit for
your talent, but we nourished it.

1965
01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:21,354
We let you do your thing.

1966
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:25,150
God damn it!
We deserve better than this.

1967
01:40:25,233 --> 01:40:27,277
You know what, don't think that
I don't appreciate ...

1968
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,154
everything you guys
have done here, Jerry.

1969
01:40:29,237 --> 01:40:31,865
Ahmet, I'm very proud of the work
that we've done here together.

1970
01:40:31,906 --> 01:40:35,160
But, Atlantic has done pretty good
money-wise on my records, haven't they?

1971
01:40:35,243 --> 01:40:36,661
Yes, we've done very well, Ray.

1972
01:40:36,744 --> 01:40:39,956
You ... you were the ones that taught
me that making a record is business,

1973
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:42,375
and find the best
business deal you can.

1974
01:40:42,459 --> 01:40:45,712
Now, 75 cents of every dollar,
and owning my own masters ...

1975
01:40:45,795 --> 01:40:47,922
is a pretty damn good deal.

1976
01:40:48,465 --> 01:40:50,091
Can you match it?

1977
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:55,180
Ray, we would love to
match it, but we just can't.

1978
01:40:56,514 --> 01:40:59,350
That's a better deal
than Sinatra gets.

1979
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:03,730
I'm very proud of you.

1980
01:41:06,232 --> 01:41:09,819
Looks like those boys are going
to get a taste of country dumb.

1981
01:41:09,903 --> 01:41:11,070
Yeah.

1982
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:15,325
He'll be all right, man.

1983
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:18,411
You guys always do find the best.

Thought you said that ABC wasn't
going to force nothing on him.

1995
01:42:18,471 --> 01:42:19,931
They didn't.

1996
01:42:20,598 --> 01:42:22,308
It was Ray's idea.

1997
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:25,437
Something new.

1998
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,106
What are we then, Jeff?
Something old?

1999
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:31,818

What the hell is wrong with that?

2006
01:43:11,649 --> 01:43:14,194
Critics say you've gone
middle-of-the-road.

2007
01:43:14,277 --> 01:43:17,363
The orchestra, the choir,
The Perry Como Show, man?

2008
01:43:17,447 --> 01:43:20,992
If I feel the music,
that means it's real.

2009
01:43:21,075 --> 01:43:23,703
No, it ain't.
Ray Charles is a sellout.

2010
01:43:23,787 --> 01:43:26,790
The blind Liberace, leaving those
Rocking Chair roots behind.

2011
01:43:26,873 --> 01:43:27,832
Quincy Jones.

2012
01:43:27,916 --> 01:43:29,793
Can we get a picture
of these two guys?

2013
01:43:29,876 --> 01:43:31,711
- Six-nine!
- Hey, boy.

2014
01:43:31,795 --> 01:43:34,214
Look, here, uh,
this interview is over.

2015
01:43:34,297 --> 01:43:36,174
I'd love to
get you two together, man.

2016
01:43:36,216 --> 01:43:37,634
S-some other time.

2017
01:43:37,967 --> 01:43:40,595
Look at you. How's it going, man?
You look good.

2018
01:43:40,678 --> 01:43:42,722
Let me look at you.
You look good, too.

2019
01:43:42,806 --> 01:43:44,474
You hear what they're
saying about me?

2020
01:43:44,557 --> 01:43:47,644
I just said that I ... I can't do it
no more. I've gone middle-of-the-road.

2021
01:43:47,727 --> 01:43:49,145
So crank out another hit.

2022
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:50,355
Let me tell you something,

2023
01:43:50,396 --> 01:43:52,857
it ain't easy
to keep on being greezy, kid.

2024
01:43:53,316 --> 01:43:54,734
Where you blow in from?

2025
01:43:55,944 --> 01:43:57,028
Paris.

2026
01:43:57,112 --> 01:43:58,238
Bonjour.

2027
01:43:58,279 --> 01:44:00,490
Yeah, man.
France is where it's at.

2028
01:44:00,657 --> 01:44:02,742
Yeah, man. And all that stuff
you've been playing,

2029
01:44:02,826 --> 01:44:05,245
man, it's just ...
it really feels out of sight.

2030
01:44:05,286 --> 01:44:07,789
You know, we gotta
record something together.

2031
01:44:07,872 --> 01:44:09,624
I mean, people will really dig it.

2032
01:44:09,707 --> 01:44:11,584
So, where you going
after the Festival?

2033
01:44:11,626 --> 01:44:15,421
Oh, I ... I go to D.C., Richmond,
uh, Virginia, Georgia.

2034
01:44:15,505 --> 01:44:18,383
You know what, once you get the
record out there, you gotta sell it.

2035
01:44:18,425 --> 01:44:19,884
The South, man?

2036
01:44:21,094 --> 01:44:22,387
I'm not doing that no more.

2037
01:44:22,429 --> 01:44:25,265
Hey, come on, kid, that's where
the money is, baby.

2038
01:44:25,348 --> 01:44:27,892
You know, When I left Seattle
with Hamp,

2039
01:44:27,976 --> 01:44:29,185
we went down there, man.

2040
01:44:29,269 --> 01:44:31,855
And it felt like
I walked into a prison cell.

2041
01:44:31,938 --> 01:44:35,567
You know, a black man
is a "boy" in Mississippi, Ray.

2042
01:44:35,650 --> 01:44:37,569
Even if he's 80 years old.

2043
01:44:40,822 --> 01:44:43,241
I'm never playing
to Jim Crow again. Ever.

2044
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:45,118
If that's what you feel, baby.

2045
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:48,872
I'm serious, Ray.
Man, we gotta do something.

2046
01:44:50,582 --> 01:44:52,459
Well, you know,
what ... what the hell, man.

2047
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:55,920
You're just going to leave a lot
more money on the table for me.

2048
01:44:56,463 --> 01:44:58,131
You're welcome to it, man.

2049
01:45:13,229 --> 01:45:14,773
You ready to work?

2050
01:45:14,856 --> 01:45:16,149
Work on what?

2051
01:45:17,358 --> 01:45:19,235
Get over here, you gotta
help me with this.

2052
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:20,737
Percy just sent me some new music.

2053
01:45:34,793 --> 01:45:37,045
You know what
they're saying about me?

2054
01:45:37,128 --> 01:45:39,547
Said I've lost something, said
I've gone middle-of-the-road.

2055
01:45:39,631 --> 01:45:41,883
They may as well say
the same thing about you.

2056
01:45:41,966 --> 01:45:43,301
You were the soul of this band.

2057
01:45:43,343 --> 01:45:45,804
Now every time you're around,
you're just drunk.

2058
01:45:47,806 --> 01:45:49,307
Drunk soul of a blind junkie.

2059
01:45:49,390 --> 01:45:51,142
What a lovely couple.

2060
01:45:51,226 --> 01:45:53,603
Why don't you
just get out of here?

2061
01:45:55,438 --> 01:45:57,440
I ain't drunk, Ray.

2062
01:45:58,358 --> 01:45:59,692
I'm pregnant.

2063
01:46:00,902 --> 01:46:03,655
Yeah, that's right.
I'm having your baby.

2064
01:46:03,696 --> 01:46:06,533
You ain't really ...
You ... you can't do that.

2065
01:46:06,991 --> 01:46:08,660
I'm gonna have to
talk to the doctor.

2066
01:46:08,701 --> 01:46:09,869
You gotta get rid of it.

2067
01:46:11,287 --> 01:46:13,123
My God!

2068
01:46:13,248 --> 01:46:15,416
What, because
I'm not your precious Bea?

2069
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,211
I'm not good enough
to have this baby?

2070
01:46:19,379 --> 01:46:21,965
You lay up
in my bed every night.

2071
01:46:22,048 --> 01:46:23,258
My bed!

2072
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:26,052
I'm gonna have this baby, Ray.

2073
01:46:29,264 --> 01:46:31,641
- No, Ray! No!
- Come on, come on. Come on, just listen.

2074
01:46:31,724 --> 01:46:32,684
Just listen to me.

2075
01:46:32,767 --> 01:46:34,102
You know
I care about you, baby.

2076
01:46:34,185 --> 01:46:36,521
I won't let nothing happen to you.
I'll pay for everything.

2077
01:46:36,563 --> 01:46:37,647
No!

2078
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:39,899
It's gonna cost you
more than money.

2079
01:46:39,941 --> 01:46:42,944
I want you to leave her, Ray.
Come and be with our baby.

2080
01:46:43,027 --> 01:46:46,531
You out of your damn mind. You knew
the rules when you got into this.

2081
01:46:46,573 --> 01:46:48,950
You know goddamn well I ain't
gonna leave my family.

2082
01:46:50,368 --> 01:46:52,036
Leave your family?

2083
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:54,873
You are a damn fool,
you know that?

2084
01:46:55,623 --> 01:46:58,960
Between the dope
and the music and me,

2085
01:46:59,043 --> 01:47:01,713
you already done left
your damn family!

2086
01:47:02,213 --> 01:47:06,092
You know what the sad part about
it is, Ray, you don't even know it.

2087
01:47:11,014 --> 01:47:12,515
You know what?

2088
01:47:12,599 --> 01:47:16,102
From now on, it's strictly
business between you and me.

2089
01:47:19,147 --> 01:47:21,900
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Keep that anger.

Hey, Ray, it's Sam.

01:48:24,629 --> 01:48:27,006
Can you hear me? It's Sam!

2122
01:48:27,173 --> 01:48:29,801
Yeah, hey, Hit the Road
is our second number one.

2123
01:48:29,843 --> 01:48:33,012
Yeah. ABC is taking out ads
in all the trades.

2124
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:35,932
Yeah, oh, and congrats
on your Grammy nomination.

2125
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:39,060
No, no, no I know
you're going to win.

2126
01:48:39,811 --> 01:48:41,479
Hey, you feeling all right?

2127
01:48:41,938 --> 01:48:44,524
Well, come on, baby, be happy.
You're doing good.

2128
01:48:44,774 --> 01:48:45,859
Thank you, Sam.

2129
01:48:47,068 --> 01:48:48,862
I really am happy about that.

2130
01:48:49,404 --> 01:48:50,947
Yeah.

2131
01:48:54,534 --> 01:48:57,912
I'll stop by Jeff's room
and get my money on my way out.

2132
01:49:04,919 --> 01:49:05,920
Ray.

2133
01:49:07,672 --> 01:49:09,549
Margie, you ain't gotta leave, baby.

2134
01:49:09,716 --> 01:49:11,676
I'm on your hit record.

2135
01:49:11,843 --> 01:49:14,679
If I'm ever going to go solo,
then now's the time.

2136
01:49:14,721 --> 01:49:16,556
Yeah, I ... I don't want you ...

2137
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:18,475
I don't want you to go solo.

2138
01:49:18,558 --> 01:49:21,019
Ray, for once,
I'm doing something for me.

2139
01:49:22,061 --> 01:49:24,522
You remember the hummingbird,
right?

2140
01:49:25,315 --> 01:49:26,316
What?

2141
01:49:26,983 --> 01:49:28,735
The hummingbird, Bea.

2142
01:49:41,664 --> 01:49:43,833
And I don't want you to go.

2143
01:49:57,138 --> 01:49:58,598
Somebody will fetch you ...

2144
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,183
when your bus gets to St. Augustine.

2145
01:50:00,266 --> 01:50:02,393
And when you get there,
show them this sign,

2146
01:50:02,477 --> 01:50:04,813
and tell them you're name is
Ray Charles Robinson.

2147
01:50:05,772 --> 01:50:08,691
And them sandwiches I made, don't
eat 'em all at once. You hear?

2148
01:50:08,775 --> 01:50:10,985
Oh, please, don't make me go away.

2149
01:50:11,069 --> 01:50:12,695
I'll keep up with the normal kids.

2150
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:14,739
I'll be good, just like George.

2151
01:50:14,823 --> 01:50:16,783
This ain't got nothing
to do with George.

2152
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:19,327
I've taken you
as far as I can, baby.

2153
01:50:19,494 --> 01:50:22,747
Them teachers at that blind school,
they can teach you things I can't.

2154
01:50:22,789 --> 01:50:24,541
And you need an education
in this world.

2155
01:50:24,624 --> 01:50:25,792
I don't want no education!

2156
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:26,876
Don't say that!

2157
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,878
I don't! I want to stay with you!

2158
01:50:28,962 --> 01:50:29,963
Stop it, Ray!

2159
01:50:30,046 --> 01:50:32,715
I won't have you living
hand-to-mouth like me, you hear?

2160
01:50:33,591 --> 01:50:37,011
Now listen, if you want to do
something to make your mama proud,

2161
01:50:37,303 --> 01:50:41,099
promise me, promise me you'll never
let nobody turn you into no cripple.

2162
01:50:41,182 --> 01:50:42,892
You won't become no charity case.

2163
01:50:42,976 --> 01:50:44,894
You'll stand on your own two feet.

2164
01:50:44,978 --> 01:50:46,312
I promise.

2165
01:50:46,646 --> 01:50:48,106
I love you, baby.

2166
01:50:49,149 --> 01:50:50,608
I'm so proud of you.

2167
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:06,749
No more segregation!

2168
01:51:06,833 --> 01:51:09,836
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2169
01:51:09,919 --> 01:51:13,006
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2170
01:51:16,968 --> 01:51:19,763
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2171
01:51:19,846 --> 01:51:22,849
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2172
01:51:22,932 --> 01:51:25,977
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2173
01:51:26,019 --> 01:51:27,812
Welcome back to Augusta, Ray!

2174
01:51:27,854 --> 01:51:29,606
Hey, good to see you.

2175
01:51:29,898 --> 01:51:32,859
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

2176
01:51:32,901 --> 01:51:34,694
Do you believe
in the protest, Ray?

2177
01:51:35,028 --> 01:51:36,404
Get out of here!

2178
01:51:36,488 --> 01:51:39,032
Ray, I'm sorry about this.
Hurry on up inside.

2179
01:51:39,115 --> 01:51:40,867
We got refreshments waiting.

2180
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:42,577
Mr. Charles!
Mr. Charles!

2181
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,370
You know tonight's show
is segregated?

2182
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:46,080
The dance floor is whites only.

2183
01:51:46,164 --> 01:51:47,582
Negroes can't leave the balcony.

2184
01:51:47,665 --> 01:51:49,751
That's how it is, man.
You know, this is Georgia.

2185
01:51:49,834 --> 01:51:51,127
You think we don't know that?

2186
01:51:51,211 --> 01:51:53,546
Negroes are persecuted
in this state every day!

2187
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:55,548
Ain't nothing I can do about that.

2188
01:51:55,632 --> 01:51:58,718
I'm an entertainer. And ... and we
all gotta play Jim Crow down here.

2189
01:51:58,802 --> 01:52:00,553
I'm sorry, man.
Now get out of here, boy.

2190
01:52:00,637 --> 01:52:01,971
It doesn't have to be that way.

2191
01:52:02,055 --> 01:52:04,307
You could change things,
right here and now!

2192
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:06,017
I'm sorry, son.
Ain't nothing I can do.

2193
01:52:06,059 --> 01:52:08,103
You hear that, boy?
That's the way things are.

2194
01:52:08,186 --> 01:52:09,813
Ain't nothing
or nobody can change it.

2195
01:52:09,896 --> 01:52:12,732
Now get your black ass out of here,
and take that trash with you!

2196
01:52:12,774 --> 01:52:16,069
Hold on ... hold on. He ...
he's right. He's right, Jeff.

2197
01:52:16,152 --> 01:52:17,195
Get them on the bus.

2198
01:52:17,278 --> 01:52:18,279
You sure?

2199
01:52:18,363 --> 01:52:19,572
Get them back on the bus!

2200
01:52:19,656 --> 01:52:21,282
Y'all heard him! Y'all heard Ray!

2201
01:52:21,366 --> 01:52:23,118
Back on the bus!

2202
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:24,994
Are you serious?

2203
01:52:26,246 --> 01:52:27,372
Get them on the bus.

2204
01:52:27,413 --> 01:52:28,915
I can't do nothing here.

2205
01:52:28,957 --> 01:52:30,250
Ray, you know me.

2206
01:52:30,333 --> 01:52:33,711
I'm not gonna lose money just
because you suddenly got religion.

2207
01:52:33,753 --> 01:52:34,921
Ain't nothing I can do, man.

2208
01:52:35,004 --> 01:52:37,424
We have a contract with me.
You break it, I'll sue your ass!

2209
01:52:37,507 --> 01:52:39,592
- I'll win, Ray!
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

2210
01:52:39,676 --> 01:52:40,635
Look, I'll win big!

2211
01:52:40,718 --> 01:52:41,803
Do what you gotta do.

2212
01:52:41,886 --> 01:52:43,638
I told you, I'll own your ass, Ray!

2213
01:52:45,432 --> 01:52:46,599
Thank you, Mr. Charles.

2214
01:52:46,683 --> 01:52:48,059
You could be the first.

2215
01:52:48,101 --> 01:52:49,727
No, thank you, son.
You were right.

2216
01:52:49,811 --> 01:52:51,354
You're right.

2217
01:52:52,981 --> 01:52:55,066
You'll never work Georgia again!

2218
01:52:56,693 --> 01:53:00,113
He filed a lawsuit and
it's more than a fine, Ray.

2219
01:53:00,738 --> 01:53:04,075
This guy's got juice. He can get you
barred from ever playing Georgia again.

2220
01:53:04,909 --> 01:53:08,204
But he's willing to drop the
suit if you'll make up the gig.

2221
01:53:08,705 --> 01:53:10,665
Not if it's segregated.

2222
01:53:10,957 --> 01:53:11,916
Ray,

2223
01:53:13,626 --> 01:53:16,588
I admire what you're doing, man,
but you can't afford this.

2224
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:18,298
Georgia is
our highest-grossing state.

2225
01:53:18,381 --> 01:53:22,135
I'm not playing any more to Jim Crow
joints ever again, did you got that?

2226
01:53:22,385 --> 01:53:24,053
Yeah. I got it.

2227
01:53:24,554 --> 01:53:26,639
Jeff, get those people in here
so we can rehearse.

2228
01:53:26,723 --> 01:53:28,224

01:54:15,647 --> 01:54:16,981
Just kids onstage dancing.

Mr. Charles, it's Western Union!

2270
01:55:10,577 --> 01:55:12,120
We have a telegram for you.

2271
01:55:12,745 --> 01:55:14,122
You have to sign for it, sir.

2272
01:55:14,205 --> 01:55:15,206
I'm coming.

2273
01:55:20,003 --> 01:55:23,006
Indianapolis police. Got a report
of loud music coming from here.

2274
01:55:23,089 --> 01:55:25,216
Where do you think
you're going, pal?

2275
01:55:26,468 --> 01:55:28,052
I'm just going to the bathroom.

2276
01:55:28,094 --> 01:55:29,846
Handcuff this son of a bitch.

2277
01:55:30,555 --> 01:55:33,516
Recognize this, Ray?
Heroin's a felony.

2278
01:55:34,058 --> 01:55:36,019
It ain't like I'm dealing it, man.

2279
01:55:36,102 --> 01:55:37,562
I'm not hurting nobody.

2280
01:55:37,604 --> 01:55:39,522
Oh, no, you're hurting everybody.

2281
01:55:39,731 --> 01:55:42,650
Your jungle music is
poisoning our kids' minds.

2282
01:55:42,734 --> 01:55:44,903
Hey, I'm gonna put
your black ass away forever.

2283
01:55:44,944 --> 01:55:48,364
You have to understand.
I got ... I got a wife, I got kids.

2284
01:55:48,448 --> 01:55:49,616
I got responsibilities.

2285
01:55:49,657 --> 01:55:51,701
Why don't you tell that story
to these people.

2286
01:55:51,785 --> 01:55:53,161
Bring them in!

2287
01:55:56,122 --> 01:55:57,916
Ray! Was it a setup, Ray?

2288
01:55:57,957 --> 01:55:59,834
How long you been on heroin?

2289
01:55:59,918 --> 01:56:01,294
Come on, Ray.

2290
01:56:01,336 --> 01:56:03,379

2298
01:56:43,878 --> 01:56:44,963
Hi, baby.

2299
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:46,339
David.

2300
01:56:46,381 --> 01:56:47,841
Uh, uh, Bea, he can stay.

2301
01:56:47,924 --> 01:56:49,509
No. Baby, come on.

2302
01:56:49,968 --> 01:56:51,261
- Bea?
- What?

2303
01:56:52,929 --> 01:56:54,180
You know, since I got back ...

2304
01:56:54,264 --> 01:56:55,890
Since you got out.

2305
01:56:56,099 --> 01:56:57,350
Yeah.

2306
01:56:57,725 --> 01:57:01,312
Well, since I got here, you haven't
said more than two words to me.

2307
01:57:01,521 --> 01:57:03,481
Ray, what am I supposed to say?

2308
01:57:03,857 --> 01:57:06,401
My words don't seem to
mean much to you anymore.

2309
01:57:06,484 --> 01:57:07,902
Maybe they never did.

2310
01:57:07,986 --> 01:57:10,196
Come on, Bea,
you ... you know I love you.

2311
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:11,990
Are you gonna stop then?

2312
01:57:14,033 --> 01:57:16,119
You know what, Bea, what you
don't understand is ...

2313
01:57:16,202 --> 01:57:18,496
there's a lot of mean-spirited
people out there.

2314
01:57:19,706 --> 01:57:20,665
Yeah.

2315
01:57:25,712 --> 01:57:26,838
Ray?

2316
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:33,261
You know, I had to bring Junior
home from school today ...

2317
01:57:33,344 --> 01:57:35,180
'cause of what
the other kids were sayin'.

2318
01:57:35,221 --> 01:57:36,723
They got mean-ass kids
around here.

2319
01:57:36,765 --> 01:57:38,725
I think we should move
to Beverly Hills.

2320
01:57:38,767 --> 01:57:40,310
No, no, Ray,
we're not gonna move.

2321
01:57:40,393 --> 01:57:42,353
'Cause it ... it's not
about where we live, Ray.

2322
01:57:42,395 --> 01:57:44,773
It's about what you're doing
to yourself.

2323
01:57:45,064 --> 01:57:46,691
And those boys worship you.

2324
01:57:46,733 --> 01:57:49,152
You want them to end up
using that poison, too?

2325
01:57:49,235 --> 01:57:50,904
Bea, that's not fair.

2326
01:57:50,945 --> 01:57:53,615
What's not fair?
What's not fair, Ray?

2327
01:57:53,698 --> 01:57:55,867
That ... that's a low blow.

2328
01:57:58,244 --> 01:57:59,245
Hello?

2329
01:58:00,747 --> 01:58:04,000
Don't jive me, Milt.
Don't jive me, man!

2330
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:05,210
Really?

2331
01:58:05,543 --> 01:58:09,130
Ah, good, good, good. Tell ...
tell Sam I said thank you.

2332
01:58:09,214 --> 01:58:11,216
All right. All right, then.

2333
01:58:12,759 --> 01:58:13,802
Oh, yeah!

2334
01:58:13,885 --> 01:58:16,596
What, Ray?
What? Come on, now.

2335
01:58:16,638 --> 01:58:18,473
Ray, tell me what happened.

2336
01:58:18,556 --> 01:58:20,767
ABC got the case dropped.

2337
01:58:20,809 --> 01:58:22,602
The police didn't have a warrant.

2338
01:58:22,685 --> 01:58:23,853
They bought them off.

2339
01:58:23,937 --> 01:58:25,897
Damn it, Bea, do you
want me to go to prison?

2340
01:58:25,939 --> 01:58:28,441
No. Ray, I want you
to stop lying to yourself,

2341
01:58:28,483 --> 01:58:30,568
and they are making that
completely impossible.

2342
01:58:30,652 --> 01:58:32,195
You know what,
you don't understand.

2343
01:58:32,278 --> 01:58:33,947
Then make me understand, Ray!

2344
01:58:34,030 --> 01:58:37,408
Baby, when I walk out that door,
I walk out alone in the dark!

2345
01:58:37,450 --> 01:58:38,868
I'm trying to do something ...

2346
01:58:38,952 --> 01:58:41,621
that ain't nobody ever done
in music and business.

2347
01:58:41,704 --> 01:58:44,374
But I can't do it if I'm alone
everywhere I go.

2348
01:58:44,958 --> 01:58:47,293
I don't want to be alone here, Bea.

2349
01:58:47,377 --> 01:58:49,129
Not in my own home.

2350
01:58:52,799 --> 01:58:55,427
Look, Bea,
if you don't understand me,

2351
01:58:56,302 --> 01:58:57,846
then who will?

2352
01:59:04,394 --> 01:59:05,979
I don't know, Ray.

2353
01:59:09,607 --> 01:59:11,943
David? I'm coming!

2354
01:59:13,027 --> 01:59:14,487
Mama's coming!

2355
01:59:18,324 --> 01:59:22,245
Ray, we pull you out of the fire,
and you want country music?

2356
01:59:22,328 --> 01:59:25,415
Look here, I've been singing
country music all my life.

2357
01:59:25,498 --> 01:59:27,959
As a matter of fact, I used to
play with the Florida Playboys.

2358
01:59:28,042 --> 01:59:29,544
We made a big investment in you ...

2359
01:59:29,627 --> 01:59:31,087
and it's paying off handsomely.

2360
01:59:31,171 --> 01:59:32,839
For both of us, I might add.

2361
01:59:32,922 --> 01:59:34,466
We don't want to lose your fan base.

2362
01:59:34,549 --> 01:59:36,634
Yeah, you know,
you got a point there,

2363
01:59:36,676 --> 01:59:40,138
but I actually think that we have
more to gain than we do to lose.

2364
01:59:41,097 --> 01:59:43,767
Ray, it's a bad idea.

2365
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:48,229
When I came to ABC, you guys
put in the contract ...

2366
01:59:48,313 --> 01:59:50,356
that I can choose my own music.

2367
01:59:51,232 --> 01:59:52,984
You want to read that paragraph?

2368
01:59:57,197 --> 01:59:58,907
It's on page three.

2369
02:00:00,241 --> 02:00:01,826
I don't need to see it.

2370
02:00:11,211 --> 02:00:13,421
Good evening, Saint Louis.

2371
02:00:13,505 --> 02:00:15,882
It's time
for the main attraction.

2372
02:00:15,924 --> 02:00:19,511
The innovator of soul.
The genius himself.

2373
02:00:19,844 --> 02:00:21,638
Ray Charles!

2374
02:00:41,074 --> 02:00:42,242
Go on, go on, Ray!

2375
02:00:47,413 --> 02:00:48,665
Thank you so much.

2376
02:00:48,748 --> 02:00:51,918
You know what, I know that a
lot of y'all don't know that ...

2377
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:55,130
I ... I was brought up in the South.

2378
02:00:55,213 --> 02:00:58,341
You know, every time you turn
on the radio there in the South,

2379
02:00:58,425 --> 02:00:59,759
you hear the Grand Ole Opry.

2380
02:00:59,843 --> 02:01:02,971
That's what I grew up singing,
so I hope you don't mind,

2381
02:01:03,596 --> 02:01:07,100
I ... I want to sing something to give
you a taste of my country roots.

2382
02:01:08,351 --> 02:01:09,644
"Unchain My Heart!"

2383
02:01:09,853 --> 02:01:11,396

Dad, if you can't see, how can
you choose the right color socks?

02:02:24,844 --> 02:02:26,805
I'm ... I'm gonna show you,

See? Right here?

2406
02:02:30,475 --> 02:02:33,478
The two, right there, I got it
sewn in thick, so I can feel it.

2407
02:02:33,603 --> 02:02:35,271
So, it means two is brown.

02:02:35,355 --> 02:02:37,690
One is black. Three is blue.

2409

And ... and ... and where's four?

2410
02:02:39,609 --> 02:02:40,693
Nowhere.

2411
02:02:40,777 --> 02:02:43,196

Change back at the hotel.

2420
02:03:23,903 --> 02:03:25,989
They bought that country
jive hook, line and sinker.

2421
02:03:26,072 --> 02:03:27,240
Ray, man, you're amazing.

2422
02:03:27,323 --> 02:03:30,452
I'm gonna tell you something. Country
music. You know why they like it?

2423
02:03:30,535 --> 02:03:32,662
The stories, man.
They got great stories.

2424
02:03:32,745 --> 02:03:33,788
Hey, Joe.

2425
02:03:33,872 --> 02:03:37,250
Ray, I want to introduce you to
Joe Adams. Hal Ziegler hired Joe ...

2426
02:03:37,292 --> 02:03:39,669
as the announcer
for the rest of the tour.

2427
02:03:39,753 --> 02:03:42,255
I know you, Mayor of Melody.

2428
02:03:42,338 --> 02:03:44,799
I used to listen to your
radio show in L.A. In the '50s.

2429
02:03:44,883 --> 02:03:47,427
We've both come a ways since then.

2430
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:50,138
What was that counting
you were doing back there?

2431
02:03:50,263 --> 02:03:52,807
I was cueing down the lights.
That shuts up the audience ...

2432
02:03:52,891 --> 02:03:55,518
so you can sing your ballad
instead of having to scream it.

2433
02:03:55,602 --> 02:03:57,896
Hey, well, I'll be damned.
Who told you to do that?

2434
02:03:57,937 --> 02:03:59,689
No one. It just needed to be done.

2435
02:03:59,773 --> 02:04:01,608
See, that's what I'm talking about.

2436
02:04:01,691 --> 02:04:04,611
I like to hear a person say
"It needed to be done" ...

2437
02:04:04,652 --> 02:04:06,154
as opposed to a person saying,
"It ain't my job."

2438
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:07,914
Well, You know ...

2439
02:04:08,114 --> 02:04:10,116
You know,
tell me about Central Avenue.

2440
02:04:10,283 --> 02:04:11,618
I know you know Jack Lauderdale.

2441

Ray, I got some good news for you.

2448
02:04:27,759 --> 02:04:29,344
We got the cover of Cash Box.

2449
02:04:29,427 --> 02:04:32,639
The nation's hottest album:
"Modern Sounds of Country & Western."

2450
02:04:32,722 --> 02:04:33,765
Man, you are hotter than hell.

2451
02:04:33,848 --> 02:04:34,849
That's what they say.

2452
02:04:34,933 --> 02:04:37,310
I've been watchin', your albums
are going through the roof,

2453
02:04:37,393 --> 02:04:39,145
your concerts are
always selling out.

2454
02:04:39,187 --> 02:04:40,772
You'll need shelters
for your money.

2455
02:04:40,814 --> 02:04:42,357
You're in a new tax bracket.

2456
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:45,276
Keep your drawers on, Fathead!
I got the instruments!

2457
02:04:45,318 --> 02:04:47,821
Jeff, Joe was in

2459
02:04:49,489 --> 02:04:50,532
Otto Preminger.

2460
02:04:50,615 --> 02:04:53,701
He was also on Broadway
with Lena Horne.

2461
02:04:53,827 --> 02:04:56,287
She was the star.
I was supporting.

2462
02:04:56,454 --> 02:04:57,997
Is that a fact?

2463

Bea, there's a park right
at the end of the street.

2482
02:05:53,845 --> 02:05:56,097
You can see the whole L.A.
Basin from there.

2483
02:05:56,181 --> 02:05:58,349
Not even Beverly Hills
has views like that.

You like it, don't you?

02:06:01,186 --> 02:06:02,687
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

You got to like it.

2487
02:06:04,272 --> 02:06:05,273
Voilà.

2488
02:06:05,356 --> 02:06:08,693
This foyer is designed to impress
anybody who walks through the door.

2489
02:06:08,735 --> 02:06:11,780
It has a big winding staircase,
just like "Gone With the Wind".

2490
02:06:11,863 --> 02:06:15,033
We should get our portraits
painted, like Rhett and Scarlett.

2491
02:06:15,241 --> 02:06:16,743
Bea, bring him on in here.

2492
02:06:16,826 --> 02:06:19,245
Ray, wait till you hear
what's waiting in the living room.

2493
02:06:19,287 --> 02:06:20,288
What is it?

2494
02:06:20,413 --> 02:06:24,250
I had them build you a solid
marble fireplace, two stories high.

2495
02:06:24,334 --> 02:06:26,503
Hot damn! How do you like it, Bea?

2496
02:06:26,586 --> 02:06:27,670
It's awful big.

2497
02:06:27,754 --> 02:06:29,339
It sure is: 8,500 square feet.

2498
02:06:29,422 --> 02:06:31,216
Biggest house in the neighborhood.

2499
02:06:31,257 --> 02:06:33,051
So, does this meet
with your approval?

2500
02:06:33,093 --> 02:06:34,594
Man, this is a palace.

2501
02:06:34,677 --> 02:06:37,180
You think this is big? Wait
until tomorrow when you see ...

2502
02:06:37,263 --> 02:06:39,557
30,000 square feet
of RPM Incorporated.

2503
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:41,392
Yeah, headquarters!

This is it, Ray.
Your brand-new recording studio.

2505
02:06:43,895 --> 02:06:45,522
Did you get everything I asked for?

2506
02:06:45,605 --> 02:06:46,856
Totally state-of-the-art.

2507
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:50,902
Tom Dowd built an eight-track mixing
console, two recorders, the works.

2508
02:06:50,944 --> 02:06:53,363
Now, this room is bigger
than most people's houses.

2509
02:06:53,446 --> 02:06:55,865
- Got your own private bathroom
to your left. - Good.

2510
02:06:55,949 --> 02:06:58,201
Right behind you
is my adjoining office.

2511
02:06:58,284 --> 02:07:00,620
And step over to your
private bar to your left.

2512
02:07:00,703 --> 02:07:02,622
Got a bottle of Bols
right in the center.

2513
02:07:02,664 --> 02:07:04,082
You know me pretty good.

2514
02:07:04,124 --> 02:07:06,543
If you run out, shout,
I'm right next door.

2515
02:07:06,876 --> 02:07:08,211
This is nice, right here.

2516
02:07:08,294 --> 02:07:09,671
It's the house that Ray built.

2517
02:07:09,754 --> 02:07:10,797
Yes, it is.

2518
02:07:11,089 --> 02:07:12,799
♪ Born to lose ♪

2519
02:07:14,467 --> 02:07:18,138
♪ I've lived my life in vain ♪

2520
02:07:22,851 --> 02:07:24,644
Ray Junior, slow down!

2521
02:07:24,727 --> 02:07:26,604
This ain't no baseball diamond!

2522
02:07:29,065 --> 02:07:30,733
Charles residence.

2523
02:07:31,401 --> 02:07:33,027
Mr. Charles?

2524
02:07:33,236 --> 02:07:35,738
Hey, girl,
Bring that boy over here!

2525
02:07:35,822 --> 02:07:37,949
I got a hot dog with his
name on it! Come on, now.

2526
02:07:38,032 --> 02:07:39,200
Hello.

2527
02:07:39,659 --> 02:07:41,786
Uh, yes, I know who you are.

2528
02:07:43,121 --> 02:07:45,290
What? Oh, God, no.

2529
02:07:45,832 --> 02:07:46,791
Ray.

2530
02:07:46,833 --> 02:07:50,336
Yes, I'll get on a plane and
I'll be there as soon as I can.

2531
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:51,755
What happened?

2532
02:07:53,882 --> 02:07:55,216
Margie's dead.

2533
02:07:55,592 --> 02:07:57,260
Oh, God! H-How?

2534
02:07:59,012 --> 02:08:00,513
She overdosed.

2535
02:08:03,892 --> 02:08:05,685
I didn't start her, Bea.

2536
02:08:06,853 --> 02:08:08,313
I didn't let her do dope around me.

2537
02:08:08,396 --> 02:08:10,356
I ... I just wouldn't
let that happen.

2538
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:13,693
Yes, I'm sure, Ray.
I'm sure you set a fine example.

2539
02:08:17,864 --> 02:08:19,616
What about her baby?

2540
02:08:24,078 --> 02:08:25,371
You knew?

2541
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:28,124
His name is Charles Wayne.

2542
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:32,337
He was born October 1, in
New York City. He's 3 years old.

2543
02:08:33,296 --> 02:08:34,798
The baby's fine.

2544
02:08:35,715 --> 02:08:37,509
He's at her sister's.

2545
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:41,221
All right. I'll start sending
them some money.

2546
02:08:41,304 --> 02:08:44,390
You don't have to.
I send them money every month.

2547
02:09:09,249 --> 02:09:10,875
In five minutes,
Mr. Charles will be here,

2548
02:09:10,917 --> 02:09:12,419
and he'll be ready to go.

2549
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:14,045
Now the charts
Jeff is handing out ...

2550
02:09:14,087 --> 02:09:16,923
should be turned in
at the conclusion of ...

2551
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:19,592
You're late, that's a $50 fine.

2552
02:09:20,135 --> 02:09:21,594
I ain't late.

2553
02:09:21,636 --> 02:09:23,721
I give them
a 10-minute grace period, Joe.

2554
02:09:23,805 --> 02:09:27,100
Five minutes after two.
He's late. He'll be charged $50.

2555
02:09:27,183 --> 02:09:29,686
What? You know what?
Where's Ray?

2556
02:09:29,769 --> 02:09:32,105
You don't have to talk to Ray,
you're talking to me.

2557
02:09:32,188 --> 02:09:36,401
I'll talk to whoever I damn well
please, and it sure as hell ain't you.

2558
02:09:36,443 --> 02:09:37,777
Jive jerk.

2559
02:09:42,532 --> 02:09:43,700
Hey, Ray,

2560
02:09:43,783 --> 02:09:47,912
this fool Joe Adams is trying
to fine me for being late.

2561
02:09:48,204 --> 02:09:49,664
What time did you get here?

2562
02:09:49,748 --> 02:09:53,752
What? Just now.
The band's still setting up.

2563
02:09:54,335 --> 02:09:55,962
- Jeff don't ...
- Look, I'm not Jeff.

2564
02:09:56,045 --> 02:09:57,797
That's a fact, Jack!

2565
02:09:58,965 --> 02:10:01,634
Ray, you said the band was my thing.

2566
02:10:01,718 --> 02:10:03,178
It is.

2567
02:10:03,261 --> 02:10:05,930
Then, Fathead,
you go on back to rehearsal.

2568
02:10:06,973 --> 02:10:08,308
Ray.

2569
02:10:08,767 --> 02:10:11,186
Ray, you know how it is,
you've been there.

2570
02:10:11,728 --> 02:10:14,063
Fathead, go on now.
Let me handle this.

2571
02:10:14,147 --> 02:10:15,857
Fathead, go on now.

2572
02:10:19,319 --> 02:10:21,404
You want to tell me what the hell
is going on, Ray?

2573
02:10:21,488 --> 02:10:23,490
I'm not doing anything
I haven't been asked to.

2574
02:10:23,573 --> 02:10:25,116
Ray's running a business.

2575
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:28,244
He shouldn't have to waste time
hearing why people were late.

2576
02:10:28,328 --> 02:10:30,121
I'm not talking to you, Joe.

2577
02:10:30,163 --> 02:10:31,915
I'm talking to Ray.

2578
02:10:36,878 --> 02:10:39,839
Ray, now I know you think
I'm soft on the band,

2579
02:10:39,881 --> 02:10:42,258
but those cats would do
whatever I ask.

2580
02:10:42,342 --> 02:10:45,011
But If you come in here with this,
uh, "running a business" crap,

2581
02:10:45,053 --> 02:10:47,305
you're gonna lose some good people.
I'm telling you, Ray.

2582
02:10:47,347 --> 02:10:49,766
There are musicians waiting in
line to play with Ray Charles.

2583
02:10:49,849 --> 02:10:52,685
Not for long,
once they get a taste of you.

2584
02:10:53,353 --> 02:10:55,563
Ray, you're the leader, man.
Be one! Come on, now.

2585
02:10:55,647 --> 02:10:57,649
You now what Jeff, I mean
things have changed.

2586
02:10:57,690 --> 02:11:00,777
It ain't like the days when it was
seven of us on the Chitlin' Circuit.

2587
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:04,322
I mean, if you weren't busy building
a bowling alley, you'd seen that.

2588
02:11:04,697 --> 02:11:06,533
So you know about that, huh?

2589
02:11:06,991 --> 02:11:08,910
I know about everything.

2590
02:11:09,536 --> 02:11:11,496
I'm just trying to figure out
how you did it.

2591
02:11:11,579 --> 02:11:13,206
You think
I'm stealing from you, Ray?

2592
02:11:13,289 --> 02:11:16,543
If the Shaw Agency is gonna give you
a cut of the 10% I'm given them.

2593
02:11:16,626 --> 02:11:19,587
I might as well keep the
goddamn money in my pocket.

2594
02:11:19,879 --> 02:11:22,173
Leave us alone. We need to talk.

2595
02:11:23,258 --> 02:11:24,342
Ray.

2596
02:11:24,759 --> 02:11:26,803
You can step outside, Joe.

2597
02:11:28,638 --> 02:11:30,432
I'll be in my office.

2598
02:11:35,895 --> 02:11:39,774
Ray, now I know that jealous bastard
planted that lie in your head.

2599
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:43,403
But I have never stolen
from you, Ray, and I never will.

2600
02:11:43,445 --> 02:11:47,282
I got a small business loan, and, yeah,
Milt Shaw was giving me a little extra,

2601
02:11:47,365 --> 02:11:48,992
but I'm not a thief, Ray.

2602
02:11:49,075 --> 02:11:50,410
Then what about that, Jeff, huh?

2603
02:11:50,452 --> 02:11:54,539
A promoter swearing you did side deals
with him so you could split my overages!

2604
02:11:54,622 --> 02:11:56,499
How could you do that to me?

2605
02:11:56,583 --> 02:11:58,668
We've been through so much,
we be so like brothers.

2606
02:11:58,752 --> 02:12:00,462
You know what, Ray?

2607
02:12:01,546 --> 02:12:04,549
If we were like brothers,

2608
02:12:04,883 --> 02:12:07,302
why are you paying Joe
more than you're paying me?

2609
02:12:07,385 --> 02:12:09,763
Damn all that!
You broke my heart, man.

2610
02:12:09,804 --> 02:12:14,142
Well, you know what, Ray? You broke
mine a long goddamn time ago!

2611
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:16,936
Well, then there it is.

2612
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,195
You know something, Ray?

2613
02:12:25,278 --> 02:12:27,071
You're going to get yours one day.

2614
02:12:27,113 --> 02:12:30,950
And I pray to God that he has mercy
on your soul, you son of a bitch!

2615
02:12:38,708 --> 02:12:40,752
Everything all right, Ray?

2616
02:12:41,961 --> 02:12:44,297
How the hell do you think it is?

2617
02:12:54,974 --> 02:12:58,311
Go tell him. Go tell him!
Go, go tell him.

2618
02:12:59,896 --> 02:13:01,272
Hey, Dad. Hi, there.

2619
02:13:01,314 --> 02:13:03,358
I made the all-star team!
The game's on Thursday.

2620
02:13:03,441 --> 02:13:04,484
Oh, that's great.

2621
02:13:04,567 --> 02:13:07,320
Oh, damn! I'm not gonna be in town.
I'm gotta go on tour.

2622
02:13:07,362 --> 02:13:09,948
How about I buy you guys
new uniforms, huh?

2623
02:13:10,031 --> 02:13:12,075
Tell the coach I don't care
how much they cost.

2624
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:13,076
Okay.

2625
02:13:13,159 --> 02:13:15,703
All right, son, you want to take
your dad's briefcase inside.

2626
02:13:15,787 --> 02:13:18,415
The plane to Montreal leaves at 11:00.
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

2627
02:13:18,498 --> 02:13:19,457
All right.

2628
02:13:19,999 --> 02:13:21,960
Did you hear what
Ray Junior said to you?

2629
02:13:22,001 --> 02:13:22,961
Yeah.

2630
02:13:23,002 --> 02:13:25,338
Do you know how much making the
all-star team means to him?

2631
02:13:25,422 --> 02:13:27,882
I know. I got things on my mind.
We had to fire Jeff.

2632
02:13:27,966 --> 02:13:28,967
What?

2633
02:13:29,008 --> 02:13:30,051
He was stealing.

2634
02:13:30,135 --> 02:13:31,219
- Jeff?
- Hmm.

2635
02:13:31,302 --> 02:13:32,595
I don't believe it.

2636
02:13:32,679 --> 02:13:34,639

We're goanna need to see some
identification, please.

2648
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,416
You just arrived from Montreal?

2649
02:14:43,458 --> 02:14:44,876
Yes. Is there a problem?

2650
02:14:44,918 --> 02:14:47,253
We were alerted there might
be drugs on this plane.

2651
02:14:47,337 --> 02:14:49,714
What? That's outrageous!
I'm going to call our lawyer.

2652
02:14:49,756 --> 02:14:52,008
No lawyers
at international checkpoints.

2653
02:14:52,092 --> 02:14:54,594
Now, we're going to have to
search everyone on this plane.

2654
02:14:54,677 --> 02:14:57,430
Mr. Charles, if you don't mind
we'd like to start with you.

2655
02:14:57,472 --> 02:14:59,349
I'd like to see your overcoat.

2656
02:14:59,432 --> 02:15:00,642
I don't mind.

2657
02:15:00,725 --> 02:15:02,102
Don't say anything, Ray.

2658
02:15:02,769 --> 02:15:03,812
What's this?

2659
02:15:05,772 --> 02:15:08,149
Ray, this isn't some judge
in Indiana.

2660
02:15:08,233 --> 02:15:10,276
It's federal.
They can charge you with smuggling ...

2661
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:12,070
which can mean real prison time.

2662
02:15:13,363 --> 02:15:16,366
Our lawyers will do
what they can, but ...

2663
02:15:36,136 --> 02:15:37,470
Hello.

2664
02:15:39,597 --> 02:15:41,474
You can't hide out
in here forever, Ray.

2665
02:15:41,516 --> 02:15:43,351
Look, it's my house.
I'm not in prison yet.

2666
02:15:43,435 --> 02:15:44,477
No, it's my house.

2667
02:15:44,561 --> 02:15:47,439
You ain't been here more than
six days since we moved in.

2668
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:49,566
No, Ray, no!
A needle ain't gonna solve this!

2669
02:15:49,649 --> 02:15:50,608
Get out of the way. Move!

2670
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:52,485
Only thing
that can help you is God, Ray.

2671
02:15:52,569 --> 02:15:55,280
Don't think of God? Do you have any
idea how it feels to go blind ...

2672
02:15:55,321 --> 02:15:56,781
and still be afraid of the dark?

2673
02:15:56,823 --> 02:15:59,993
And every day, you stand pray for just
a little light, and you get nothing.

2674
02:16:00,076 --> 02:16:01,911
'Cause God don't listen
to people like me.

2675
02:16:01,995 --> 02:16:03,037
Stop talking like that.

2676
02:16:03,121 --> 02:16:05,999
As far as I'm concerned, me and
God is even and I do what I please.

2677
02:16:06,082 --> 02:16:08,126
If goddamn it, if I want
to shoot up, I shoot up.

2678
02:16:08,209 --> 02:16:10,920
Then go ahead!
But you walk out that door ...

2679
02:16:11,004 --> 02:16:13,339
and I'm doing something I should
have done a long time ago.

2680
02:16:13,423 --> 02:16:15,175
I'm taking my boys and I'll leave.

2681
02:16:15,216 --> 02:16:17,260
You're not going away.
You ... you have no place to go.

2682
02:16:17,343 --> 02:16:18,845
- No place?
- No.

2683
02:16:18,928 --> 02:16:21,014
You think I'm scared of losing this?

2684
02:16:21,097 --> 02:16:24,017
Ray, the only thing I was
ever scared of losing was you.

2685
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:27,228
Because where was I ever gonna
find another Ray Robinson?

2686
02:16:28,730 --> 02:16:31,316
So I put up with
some terrible stuff.

2687
02:16:31,524 --> 02:16:33,359
Maybe that makes me part to blame.

2688
02:16:33,443 --> 02:16:34,778
But I ain't scared no more.

2689
02:16:34,861 --> 02:16:37,530
You know I love you and those
boys more than anything.

2690
02:16:37,614 --> 02:16:40,033
That is a damn lie
and you know it!

2691
02:16:41,576 --> 02:16:43,244
You ever look at this?

2692
02:16:43,495 --> 02:16:45,747
Really look at it, Ray!

2693
02:16:46,081 --> 02:16:49,167
Ray Charles Junior's
"Most Valuable Player."

2694
02:16:50,585 --> 02:16:52,754
He was so proud this day,

2695
02:16:53,838 --> 02:16:57,717
until you came home too loaded
to go to his banquet.

2696
02:16:57,759 --> 02:17:01,054
No! No! There is something you
love more than me and them boys,

2697
02:17:01,096 --> 02:17:03,765
more than all the women you
ever slept with on the road,

2698
02:17:03,848 --> 02:17:05,475
more than all
the dope you ever took.

2699
02:17:05,558 --> 02:17:07,894
- What are you talking about?
- Your music.

2700
02:17:09,771 --> 02:17:12,107
And if you don't stop
using that needle,

2701
02:17:12,232 --> 02:17:15,360
they're gonna take away your
music and put you in jail.

2702
02:17:19,239 --> 02:17:21,574
Is that poison
worth losing everything?

2703
02:18:03,700 --> 02:18:05,368
Mr. Charles?

2704
02:18:17,756 --> 02:18:19,257
Mr. Charles.

2705
02:18:19,924 --> 02:18:21,718
You don't have to go through this.

2706
02:18:22,594 --> 02:18:26,431
We have a substitute that can
help wean you off heroin.

2707
02:18:26,765 --> 02:18:30,977
I have to do it on my own.
I can do it. I can do it.

2708
02:18:31,686 --> 02:18:33,146
Ah. Don't touch me.

2709
02:18:36,483 --> 02:18:37,817
All right.

2710
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:40,028
We'll do it your way.

2711
02:18:51,122 --> 02:18:52,457
Doctor?

2712
02:18:52,707 --> 02:18:55,752
Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles,
I'm coming.

2713
02:18:56,503 --> 02:18:58,213
He's got no fluids left.

2714
02:18:58,338 --> 02:19:00,090
Get an I.V. in him right away.

2715
02:19:00,507 --> 02:19:02,342
- I'll insert the needle.
- No needles.

2716
02:19:02,425 --> 02:19:04,344
Yes. It's very important.
You need this.

2717
02:19:04,427 --> 02:19:06,346
Runner, I've got a runner!

2718
02:19:07,013 --> 02:19:08,014
Whoa.

2719
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:12,018
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Get him on the bed.

2720
02:19:12,602 --> 02:19:15,105
Put those restraints on him.

2721
02:19:15,563 --> 02:19:17,148
No needles.

2722
02:19:35,417 --> 02:19:36,876
No, no.

2723
02:19:37,877 --> 02:19:39,254
Oh.

2724
02:19:43,258 --> 02:19:45,593
George, I miss you.
I miss you, George.

2725
02:19:45,718 --> 02:19:48,054
I miss you.

2726
02:19:52,725 --> 02:19:54,060
Oh.

2727
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:08,825
- Okay.
- Uh-oh.

2728
02:20:08,908 --> 02:20:11,202
You might be in trouble
right there, Doc.

2729
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:22,505
Hot damn,
you whupped my ass again!

2730
02:20:22,589 --> 02:20:25,341
I — I'll tell you what, I won't
lose again the same way twice.

2731
02:20:25,425 --> 02:20:28,887
I spoke with the judge in Boston,
and he'll agree to probation.

2732
02:20:29,179 --> 02:20:31,431
He was impressed with
your attorney's arguments,

2733
02:20:31,514 --> 02:20:33,558
and he believes
you deserve one more chance.

2734
02:20:33,641 --> 02:20:35,059
Oh, that's great.

2735
02:20:35,101 --> 02:20:37,103
But you must complete
our program ...

2736
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:39,230
and agree to take
periodic drug tests.

2737
02:20:39,314 --> 02:20:41,566
You know what. I'll do it.
I know people don't believe ...

2738
02:20:41,608 --> 02:20:43,818
I'm done with this dope,
but I'm finished.

2739
02:20:44,778 --> 02:20:46,112
Who's George?

2740
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:51,993
Ray,

2741
02:20:52,619 --> 02:20:55,413
you've come through the worst of
the physical reactions.

2742
02:20:55,997 --> 02:20:58,833
We should begin
psychotherapy sessions.

2743
02:20:58,917 --> 02:21:01,503
Uh, look, forget
the head shrinking, Doc.

2744
02:21:01,586 --> 02:21:03,213
I can handle this.

2745
02:21:07,592 --> 02:21:09,010
Mr. Charles,

2746
02:21:09,094 --> 02:21:11,763
you're not the first
celebrity junkie I've treated.

2747
02:21:11,805 --> 02:21:12,931
Junkie? What ...

2748
02:21:13,014 --> 02:21:15,058
Nobody cons me at any price.

2749
02:21:15,141 --> 02:21:16,142
I'm not trying to do that.

2750
02:21:16,226 --> 02:21:19,437
If you want me to give that judge
a positive report,

2751
02:21:19,479 --> 02:21:21,481
you will have to earn it.

2752
02:21:24,943 --> 02:21:25,985
Doc?

2753
02:21:26,945 --> 02:21:28,404
Dr. Hacker?

2754
02:21:28,905 --> 02:21:29,948
Doc?

2755
02:22:02,397 --> 02:22:05,233
Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me!

2756
02:22:09,279 --> 02:22:10,947
He ain't there.

2757
02:22:19,330 --> 02:22:21,166
Talk to me, son.

2758
02:22:22,125 --> 02:22:25,670
I ain't no bad dream.
I'm a part of you.

2759
02:22:26,004 --> 02:22:28,506
Even all that dope
couldn't keep me away.

2760
02:22:31,468 --> 02:22:33,428
Mama, I kept my promise.

2761
02:22:33,553 --> 02:22:35,430
You got strong all right.

2762
02:22:35,513 --> 02:22:37,348
Went places I never dreamed of.

2763
02:22:38,057 --> 02:22:40,310
But you still became a cripple.

2764
02:22:46,065 --> 02:22:48,151
Come here, baby. Come here.

2765
02:22:55,742 --> 02:22:56,910
Ray?

2766
02:23:03,416 --> 02:23:05,168
It wasn't your fault.

2767
02:23:10,590 --> 02:23:12,050
Now promise us ...

2768
02:23:12,342 --> 02:23:14,052
you'll never let
nobody or nothing ...

2769
02:23:14,135 --> 02:23:16,554
turn you into
no cripple ever again.

2770
02:23:16,721 --> 02:23:19,724
That you'll always stand
on your own two feet.

2771
02:23:20,683 --> 02:23:21,851
Promise.

2772
02:23:42,789 --> 02:23:44,833
Today we're here
to right a wrong ...

2773
02:23:44,916 --> 02:23:48,336
that was done to one of our
native sons nearly 20 years ago.

2774
02:23:48,878 --> 02:23:50,338
In 1961,

2775
02:23:50,922 --> 02:23:54,092
Ray Charles was banned from
performing in the state of Georgia ...

2776
02:23:54,175 --> 02:23:57,303
because he refused to play
before a segregated audience.

2777
02:23:57,595 --> 02:24:00,557
Thankfully, we've come
a long way since then.

2778
02:24:00,974 --> 02:24:04,310
Some of us have fought for equality
through the political process,

2779
02:24:04,602 --> 02:24:08,940
but Ray Charles changed American
culture by touching people's hearts.

2780
02:24:09,274 --> 02:24:13,027
So on this day, March 7, 1979,

2781
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:16,740
we, the duly elected representatives
of the State of Georgia ...

2782
02:24:17,073 --> 02:24:21,077
not only proclaim "Georgia on My Mind"
our official state song,

2783
02:24:21,411 --> 02:24:24,622
we also offer Mr. Ray Charles
a public apology ...

2784
02:24:24,664 --> 02:24:26,624
and welcome him back home.
