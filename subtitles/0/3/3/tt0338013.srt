<i>Random thoughts
for Valentine's Day, 2004.</i>

<i>Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...</i>

4
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,937
<i>Last call...</i>

5
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:49,496
<i>to make people
feel like crap.</i>

6
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:54,168
<i>I ditched work today.</i>

7
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:57,605
<i>Took a train out to Montauk.</i>

<i>I don't know why.</i>

10
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:06,284
<i>Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.</i>

11
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:17,662
<i>I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.</i>

12
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:20,068
<i>I gotta get my car fixed.</i>

13
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:22,072
Hi. Cindy?

14
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,574
It's Joel. Joel!

15
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:28,602
Listen, I don't
feel very well today.

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,614
No, food poisoning,
I think.

17
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:34,174
<i>It's goddamn freezing on this beach.</i>

Brilliant, Joel.</i>

19

<i>Page is ripped out.</i>

<i>Sand is overrated.</i>

23
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:03,237
<i>It's just tiny little rocks.</i>

24
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,549
<i>If only I could
meet someone new.</i>

25
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:19,496
<i>I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished,</i>

26
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:24,160
<i>seeing that I'm incapable
of making eye contact
with a woman I don't know.</i>

27
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,433
<i>Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi.</i>

28
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:31,203
<i>She was nice.
Nice is good.</i>

29
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,779
<i>She loved me.</i>

30
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:15,884
<i>Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see...</i>

31
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:18,821
<i>who shows me
the least bit of attention?</i>

32
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,928
Hi.

33
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,899
I'm sorry?

34
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:06,631
- I just said hi.
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

35
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,364
Okay if I sit closer?

36
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,443
How far are you going?

37
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,775
Uh, Rockville Center.

38
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:18,145
Get out! Me too!

39
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:21,151
Really?
What are the odds?

40
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:25,379
Do I know you?

41
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:30,126
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

42
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:32,322
Sure. Sure.
That's it!

43
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,763
<i>Yeah?
I've seen you, man!</i>

44
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,997
Book slave there
for, like, five years now.

45
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,437
Ah. I would have thought
I would've remembered you.
Jesus! Is it five years?

46
00:05:42,507 --> 00:05:44,600
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:46,803
What might?
It changes a lot.

48
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:50,177
The color.
That's why you might not
recognize me.

49
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:53,911
It's called Blue Ruin,
the color.
Right. Yeah.

50
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,317
<i>Snappy name, huh?
I like it.</i>

51
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:58,788
Yeah.

52
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:01,951
Anyway, this company
makes a whole line of colors
with equally snappy names.

53
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:06,487
Red... Red Menace,
Yellow Fever,
Green Revolution.

54
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:09,499
That'd be a job,
coming up with those names.

55
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:12,502
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

56
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,097
I mean, how many hair colors
could there be? Fifty, maybe.

57
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,199
Someone's got that job.

58
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:23,314
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.

59
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:26,282
I apply my personality
in a paste.

60
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,285
Oh, I doubt that very much.

61
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:30,844
Well, you don't know me,
so...

62
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:34,048
you don't know, do you?

63
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:40,296
Sorry. I was just...
I'm trying to be nice.

64
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,124
Yeah. I got it.

65
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:06,623
My name's Clementine,
by the way.
I'm Joel.

66
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:09,023
Hi, Joel.
Hey.

67
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,619
No jokes about my name.

68
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:14,995
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.
You're trying to be nice.

69
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,995
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

70
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,231
Huckleberry Hound.

71
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,866
I don't know what that means.

72
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:27,070
Huckleberry Hound?
What are you, nuts?

73
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:29,079
It's been suggested.

74
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,022
No?

75
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,026
I'm sorry. Just...
It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

76
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,085
It's, uh...
It means "merciful."

77
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,097
Right? Clemency?

78
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,360
Although it hardly fits.

79
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,732
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

80
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,237
Gee, I-I wouldn't
think that about you.

81
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:57,502
Why wouldn't you
think that about me?
I don't know.

82
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,805
I just...

83
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,210
I don't know.
I just, uh...

84
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,214
You seem nice, so...

85
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:06,307
<i>Oh, now I'm nice?</i>

86
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:09,547
Oh, God. Don't you know
any other adjectives?

87
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,555
I don't need "nice."

88
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:15,616
I don't need myself to be it,
and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.

89
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,454
<i>Joel?</i>

90
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,796
It's Joel, right?

91
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:26,302
Yes.

92
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,805
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

93
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:32,365
I'm a little out of sorts today.

94
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,953
My embarrassing admission is,

95
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:45,956
I really like
that you're nice right now.

96
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:50,859
I mean, I can't tell
from one moment to the next
what I'm gonna like,

97
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,920
but right now...

98
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,056
I'm glad you are.

99
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:07,438
I have so much stuff
that, uh, I probably should, uh...

100
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:11,609
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
I-I'm writing, and...

101
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:13,776
No, no. I just...
Sure. No. That's okay.

102
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,446
I just have...
You know, this is...
Okay.

103
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:18,921
- Ohh! Hey!
- Take care, then.

104
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,981
<i>Jesus!</i>

105
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:38,238
Hi. I could, uh,
give you a ride, if you need.

106
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,243
<i>It's cold.</i>

107
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,211
<i>Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah?</i>

108
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,180
It is frosty.

109
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,047
<i>You're not a stalker
or anything, right?
I'm not a stalker.</i>

110
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:49,211
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?

111
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,551
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

112
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,750
Really?
There's a stalker book?

113
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,020
<i>Mm-hmm.
Okay.</i>

114
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:58,426
I gotta read that one.

115
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:07,933
Look, I'm sorry if I came off
sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

116
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:11,407
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't think you were.

117
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:20,112
Did you wanna have a drink?

118
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,379
I have lots of drinks,
and I could, um...

119
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,387
Um...

120
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,389
Never mind.

121
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:28,823
Sorry. That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.

122
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:30,884
Good night, Joel.

123
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:52,472
<i>Two Blue Ruins.</i>

124
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,281
Thank you.

125
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,287
Drink up, young man.

126
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:00,153
It'll make
the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

127
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:05,395
I'm just kidding!

128
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:07,454
Come on.

129
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,396
You're kinda closed-mouthed,
aren't you?

130
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:17,407
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:21,969
It's just, you know,
my life isn't that interesting.

132
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:25,643
I go to work, I come home.

133
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:29,218
<i>Don't know what to say.</i>

134
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:31,221
You should read my journal.

135
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:35,783
I mean, it's just... blank.

136
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,091
<i>Really?
Does that make you
sad or anxious?</i>

137
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:42,496
I mean, I'm always anxious,
thinking I'm not living
my life to the fullest,

138
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,501
taking advantage
of every possibility,

139
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:48,505
making sure
I'm not wasting one second
of the little time I have.

140
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,064
I think about that.
Yeah?

141
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,447
You're really nice.

142
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:00,348
Ohh!
God, I have to
stop saying that.

143
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,555
I'm gonna marry you.

144
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:06,556
<i>I know it.</i>

145
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,785
Um... okay.

146
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:18,464
Joel, you should come up
to the Charles with me sometime.

147
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,470
It gets frozen this time of year.

148
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,699
That sounds scary.
Exactly.

149
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,709
I'll pack a picnic.

150
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:28,678
A night picnic.
Night picnics are different.

151
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,577
And, um, we could...

152
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:32,582
Sounds good.

153
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:36,245
But I... I should, uh, go.
Now.

154
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,254
You should stay.

155
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,552
No, I really... I'm... I...

156
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,559
I have to get up so early.

157
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,561
I would like you
to call me.

158
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,393
Would you do that?
I would like it.

159
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,456
Yes.

160
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:55,735
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

161
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,672
That'd be nice.

162
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,383
What took you so long?

163
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,385
I just walked in.

164
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:45,047
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

165
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:47,353
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

166
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:49,359
Oh!

167
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:52,362
You said "I do."
I guess that means were married.

168
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,364
I guess so.

169
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,900
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?

170
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:59,402
It's really solid
this time of year.

171
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,335
Whoa! I don't know.

172
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,339
Come on.
Come on.
Eee!

173
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,341
Come on.
Come on, come on.

174
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,845
Whew.

175
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:12,405
Oh. So beautiful.

176
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,585
<i>Isn't it?</i>

177
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:20,590
<i>Uh, don't go too far.</i>

178
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,422
- Whoo! Oww! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!

179
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:26,691
- Are you okay?
- Ouch! Fuck it.

180
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:30,461
<i>Ohh! Oh, my ass!</i>

181
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:35,472
<i>I think I should go back.
Come on. Come on!</i>

182
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,474
What if it breaks?

183
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,477
- "What if"?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?

184
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,706
<i>Come here. Please.</i>

185
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,509
Come on.

186
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:49,819
Ohh.
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

187
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:52,822
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!

188
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,155
This is good.
Here, let me show you
this one thing.

189
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:58,320
What are you doing?
Whoa.

190
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,731
Come on.

191
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:09,639
Think I heard a crack.

192
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:13,473
It's not gonna crack
or break or...

193
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:15,535
It's so thick.

194
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:19,809
Show me which constellations
you know.

195
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:22,478
Um... Oh.

196
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:25,215
I don't... know any.

197
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,921
Show me
which ones you know.

198
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:31,393
Okay.

199
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:34,056
Okay.

200
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:37,589
Oh. Here's Osidius.

201
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,602
Where?

202
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,604
Right there.
See?

203
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:44,470
Sort of a swoop
and a cross.

204
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,476
Osidius the Emphatic.

205
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:50,912
You're full of shit.
Right?
Nope.

206
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,917
Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.

207
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,045
Shut the fuck up!

208
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,133
Clementine.

209
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,431
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

210
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,973
Hey.
Hey.

211
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,101
Hey.
Sorry to wake you,
but we're... here.

212
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,271
Ahh.

213
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,212
Can I come over
to your house...

214
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,952
to sleep?

215
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,893
I'm so tired.

216
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,760
Okay. Um, yeah. Sure.

217
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,732
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah. Oh.

218
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,061
Just...

219
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,579
Yes?

220
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:11,094
Can I help you?
What do you mean?

221
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:14,598
Can I help you with something?

222
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:17,293
No.

223
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:19,666
What are you doing here?

224
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:22,262
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

225
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,001
Oh.

226
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,000
Thanks.

227
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,152
<i>We're looking for 159.
What number's that?</i>

228
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:20,156
<i>I don't know where that is.</i>

229
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:23,159
<i>Jesus Christ, you'd think
they'd light the number,
or at least put a number on...</i>

230
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:25,161
<i>Is that him?
I think so.</i>

231
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:28,323
Yeah, that's him.
Wait. That's him.

232
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:45,605
<i>Hey, Joel.
Frank.</i>

233
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,512
Oh, shit.

234
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:55,025
<i>Jesus. The only
Valentine's Day cards I get
are from my mother.</i>

235
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:57,026
How pathetic is that, huh?

236
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:59,028
You're lucky
you have Clementine, man.

237
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:01,030
She is way cool.

238
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:03,589
Hey, you got any big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

239
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,604
No.

240
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:11,607
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations
or something.

241
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:13,802
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's. Right?

242
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,812
McRomance!

243
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,314
You want some fries
with that shake?

244
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:20,714
I have to, uh,
go to sleep now, Frank.

245
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,945
It's 8:30.

246
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:53,512
<i>Patrick, stop it.</i>

247
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:12,794
Ohh! Okay.

248
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,304
Okay. Okay.

249
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:18,739
Whew. Okay.

250
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,802
<i>Showtime at the Apollo.</i>

251
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:34,690
Shh, shh, shh. Hey.

252
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,885
Quiet.

253
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,874
<i>Hey, Joel. What's up?</i>

254
00:21:51,942 --> 00:21:53,876
<i>Oh. Hi, Frank.</i>

255
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,216
<i>I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom.</i>

256
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:06,222
How pathetic is that?

257
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,224
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

258
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:12,228
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

259
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:14,230
No.

260
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,232
It's only a day away.

261
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,734
Better make a reservation
or something.

262
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:20,736
Don't wanna end up
at Mickey D's.

263
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:23,295
<i>Oh, no!</i>

264
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:26,639
<i>Yes! Valentine's Day
is three goddamn days away!
I want it resolved.</i>

265
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,838
<i>I'm willing to be
the one to resolve it.</i>

266
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:33,246
So I call her,
and she's changed her number.

267
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:36,411
<i>So I walked over to Antic Attic,
you know, to get her something.</i>

268
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:40,423
<i>I thought I'd go over to work,
give her an early valentine, and...</i>

269
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:44,060
You won't believe it.

270
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:46,892
She's there with...

271
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:50,661
this guy,
this really young guy.

272
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:54,192
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

273
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:56,705
Excuse me?

274
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:59,436
Can I help you
find something, sir?

275
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,314
<i>Hey, Clem-ato.</i>

276
00:23:05,382 --> 00:23:08,442
Patrick! Baby boy.

277
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:13,723
<i>What you doing here, baby?
Just came to surprise you.</i>

278
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,692
Let me know
if you need something, sir.
You look good.

279
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,694
<i>Hi.</i>

280
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:21,856
<i>How are you?
Pretty good.
Pretty bored. Pretty tired.</i>

281
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:23,866
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

282
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:27,062
<i>I so want what's in your suit.
Oh, good.</i>

283
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:39,612
Why?

284
00:23:39,683 --> 00:23:42,174
Why would she do that to me?

285
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,581
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

286
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,253
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

287
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:53,262
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

288
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,264
I know, honey.
For being honest.

289
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:57,596
It's horrible.
I should just go to her house.

290
00:23:57,668 --> 00:24:00,603
<i>No! No, no, no.
You don't wanna go there, man.
You don't wanna go there.</i>

291
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:03,037
Get off. It's too...

292
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:05,041
<i>Right.
Yeah.</i>

293
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:07,043
I don't want to seem desperate.

294
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:11,707
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,
make a clean break. Right?

295
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:14,910
Right?

296
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,054
<i>All right, Joel,
look, man, seriously.</i>

297
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:21,057
<i>Rob!
Here's the deal.</i>

298
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,288
Don't do that.
Rob, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

299
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:27,524
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?

300
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:30,123
You're gonna make this
about our shit now?
This isn't about us.

301
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,261
<i>I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel, who's an adult.
Okay?</i>

302
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:36,329
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

303
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,576
<i>- What are you...
- That's your laundry!</i>

304
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:45,537
<i>That's great.
That's good.</i>

305
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,550
Okay.

306
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:08,767
<i>What is it?
I don't know.
It's some place that does a thing.</i>

307
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,677
<i>Good morning. Lacuna.</i>

308
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:26,679
<i>No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired
after the new year.</i>

309
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:32,587
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in...

310
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:34,961
How about on the fifth?

311
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:38,433
<i>That's a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?</i>

312
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:43,036
<i>Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.</i>

313
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:46,701
Great. Have a nice day.
See you then.

314
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:48,711
May I help you?

315
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,714
<i>I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?</i>

316
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:55,343
I'm Joel. Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr...

317
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:57,353
Mierzwiak.

318
00:25:57,421 --> 00:26:00,720
- Here. Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.

319
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,782
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.
Really?

320
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,954
- Thank you.
- Great.

321
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:07,963
I don't have a pen.

322
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:11,125
There's a pen right there.

323
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:13,135
<i>Good morning. Lacuna.
Oh.</i>

324
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:17,071
<i>Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.</i>

325
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,131
Mr. Barish?

326
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:23,445
How are we today?

327
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,447
Not too good, actually.

328
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:27,449
<i>Boo!
Oh, my God! Stan!</i>

329
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:30,452
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just...
I'm working!

330
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,819
Sorry. Sorry.

331
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:35,882
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

332
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,828
You should not
have seen this.

333
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:40,887
I apologize.

334
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:47,202
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem...

335
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:50,104
<i>I assure you, no.
No.</i>

336
00:26:55,512 --> 00:26:58,276
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

337
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:02,980
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

338
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:05,521
so I can't show you evidence.

339
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:11,323
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

340
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:13,454
and she wanted to move on.

341
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,464
<i>We provide that possibility.</i>

342
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:19,593
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy
and wanted to move on.

343
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,195
We provide
that possibility."

344
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,206
What the hell is that?

345
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:27,209
Nicest guy
she ever went out with.

346
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:29,211
<i>Oww! Fuck!</i>

347
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,713
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

348
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:33,716
It's okay.
It's all right.

349
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:36,480
Carrie, I am making
a birdhouse.

350
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:42,255
<i>What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.</i>

351
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,123
She's impulsive.

352
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:47,755
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

353
00:27:51,668 --> 00:27:53,602
A lark.

354
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,106
Why? Why? Why?
Why did you do that?

355
00:28:00,677 --> 00:28:02,440
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

356
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:05,447
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

357
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:08,507
Okay. I want it done.
I told him pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

358
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:11,952
- Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.

359
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,957
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...
to come inside.

360
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:18,586
<i>And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.</i>

361
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,327
Now, the, uh...

362
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:28,337
the first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

363
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:30,339
<i>is to go home...</i>

364
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:35,845
<i>and collect everything you own
that has some association with Clementine.</i>

365
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:38,142
<i>Anything.</i>

366
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:43,848
<i>And we'll use these items to create
a map of Clementine in your brain.</i>

367
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,514
<i>Okay?</i>

368
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,653
<i>So we'll need, uh,
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,</i>

369
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:56,688
<i>books she may have bought you,
CDs you may have bought together,</i>

370
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,395
<i>journal entries.</i>

371
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:01,232
<i>We want to empty your home...</i>

372
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:05,638
<i>We want to empty your life
of Clementine.</i>

373
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:10,203
<i>And after the mapping is done,
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.</i>

374
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,613
<i>That way, when you awake
in the morning,</i>

375
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:18,120
<i>you'll find yourself in your own bed
as if nothing had happened...</i>

376
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:20,679
<i>a new life awaiting you.</i>

377
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,152
Wake up, buddy!

378
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:34,132
<i>No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.</i>

379
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:37,367
<i>You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.</i>

380
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:42,037
Well, it's just not our policy...
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

381
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:45,774
<i>Hello. I'm right here.</i>

382
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:50,047
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can...
We can fit you in on the first of March.

383
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,556
<i>Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a- and he...</i>

384
00:29:53,623 --> 00:29:57,889
<i>All right, so let's make an appointment.
What day would you like
to come in this week?</i>

385
00:29:57,961 --> 00:30:01,397
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy
this afternoon.

386
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:05,424
<i>Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?</i>

387
00:30:06,436 --> 00:30:09,371
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

388
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,577
This is, uh, Stan Fink,

389
00:30:18,648 --> 00:30:21,242
<i>one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.</i>

390
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,811
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

391
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,323
Great to meet you,
Mr. Barish.

392
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:30,325
My name is Joel Barish,

393
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:34,955
and I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

394
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:40,059
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.

395
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:42,662
Uh, I was...

396
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:46,539
living with this woman, Naomi,

397
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,170
uh, a couple years ago,

398
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:54,479
and my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach...
I don't like parties.

399
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:57,782
<i>Naomi couldn't go, but I went...</i>

400
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:01,017
<i>and I, uh, met Clementine.</i>

401
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:04,083
I'm sorry.

402
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:07,096
Let's start with
your most recent memories...

403
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:10,759
and work backwards from there,
more or less.

404
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,768
There's an emotional core...

405
00:31:12,836 --> 00:31:14,770
to each of our memories,

406
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:18,604
and when you eradicate that core
it starts its degradation process.

407
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:21,109
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

408
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:24,909
all the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

409
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:27,006
as in a dream upon waking.

410
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:30,382
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

411
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:33,445
Well, uh, technically speaking,

412
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:35,457
<i>the procedure is brain damage,</i>

413
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:38,358
but it's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

414
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:40,362
Nothing you'll miss.

415
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,830
Comfortable?

416
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:48,530
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,
is actually creating a map of your brain.

417
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:50,937
<i>Okay, let's get started.</i>

418
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:54,738
<i>If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,
we have some work to do.</i>

419
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:58,645
I want you to react
to these objects, Mr. Barish,
if you will.

420
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:03,752
There's a good story
behind this one...

421
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,755
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,
I'll get a much better
emotional readout...

422
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:10,725
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items.

423
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:12,728
Just try to focus on the memories.

424
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:15,356
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

425
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:21,570
<i>Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts. Very good.</i>

426
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:24,903
<i>- Here's another object.
- That's so...</i>

427
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:27,569
Next item. Okay.

428
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,079
Potato head.

429
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:34,412
Next item. Okay.

430
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:39,353
<i>Just focus on the memories.
Patrick, do me a favor.</i>

431
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:42,755
<i>Hey, Patrick,
do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah.</i>

432
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:46,694
<i>Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?</i>

433
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:48,697
Uh, voltage looks fine.
Really?

434
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:52,758
Well, I'm not wiping
as clean as I like here.
I'm...

435
00:32:55,705 --> 00:33:00,836
<i>Well, uh, technically the procedure
is brain damage.</i>

436
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:05,379
Check the, uh...
Check the connections, please.

437
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,812
Oh, there you are.
I...

438
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:19,252
Why am I...
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

439
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:22,127
Why am I
standing here and...

440
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:25,031
Oh, my God.
Dj vu.

441
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:27,194
Dj vu.
This is so...

442
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,205
All right, we should get started.
If we're gonna get the procedure...

443
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:33,208
underway tonight,
we have some work to do.

444
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:35,801
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

445
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:39,212
I suppose so.
Uh, this is about right.

446
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:42,274
This is what it...
This is what it would look like.

447
00:33:44,854 --> 00:33:46,788
Very good.

448
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:49,120
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

449
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:52,525
That way you won't be confused later
by their unexplainable presence in your home.

450
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:54,859
Ah, there we go.

451
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:56,364
<i>Patrick?
Yeah?</i>

452
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:59,095
<i>Patrick, can you check...
Patrick?</i>

453
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:02,627
<i>I'm getting some sort of readout
of my own voice.
Patrick? Patrick?</i>

454
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:06,608
<i>- Why are there so many wires?
- A lot of equipment.</i>

455
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:10,476
<i>- Does that help?
- Are you sure
you set that thing up properly?</i>

456
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:12,481
<i>How's that?
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?</i>

457
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:14,642
<i>There we are,
Mr. Barish.
That's better.</i>

458
00:34:14,718 --> 00:34:18,051
- I don't know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.

459
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:20,021
We're almost done now.

460
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,218
<i>Mmm. Journal.
That would be invaluable.</i>

461
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:27,389
<i>"I met someone tonight.
I don't know what to do.</i>

462
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:30,024
<i>Her name is Clementine,
and she's amazing."</i>

463
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,625
Whoa! Jesus!

464
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:35,637
What? What?
Come on! Careful!
Step back!

465
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:37,639
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

466
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:39,538
That's fine.

467
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:41,440
Let's not roach the guy.

468
00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:46,973
All right, you got that one.

469
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,850
<i>This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?
It's an apartment, Patrick.</i>

470
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,184
Patrick.

471
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:57,352
<i>Well, not a dump, then,
but sorta plain. Uninspired.</i>

472
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,861
<i>And there's sort of
a stale smell.</i>

473
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:04,491
<i>Patrick, can we just please
get through this?</i>

474
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:08,196
<i>We got a very long night
ahead of us. Come on.
Yeah. Yeah.</i>

475
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:15,703
<i>This is the last time I saw you.</i>

476
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:32,828
It's 3:00.

477
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:37,492
<i>I kinda sorta wrecked your car.</i>

478
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:39,501
<i>Were you driving drunk?</i>

479
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:41,833
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

480
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:44,135
<i>I was a little tipsy.</i>

481
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:46,141
<i>Don't call me pathetic.</i>

482
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:48,143
Well, it is pathetic.

483
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:51,146
<i>It's fucking irresponsible.
Could've killed somebody.
Oh, God.</i>

484
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:54,149
<i>Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?
Oh, Christ!</i>

485
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:57,516
<i>Should I check the grill to see
if there's any children or small animals?
I didn't kill anybody!</i>

486
00:35:57,587 --> 00:36:01,455
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.
You're like an old lady or something.

487
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:03,958
<i>Well, what are you like?</i>

488
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:05,961
<i>A wino?
A wino?</i>

489
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:08,964
Jesus, are you from the '50s
or something?

490
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:10,966
<i>A wino?</i>

491
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:13,298
Face it, Joely.

492
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:17,806
You're freaked out because
I was out late without you,

493
00:36:17,874 --> 00:36:20,809
and in your little wormy brain...

494
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:24,870
you're trying to figure out,
did she fuck someone tonight?

495
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:28,417
No, see, Clem,

496
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:31,079
I assume
you fucked someone tonight.

497
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:33,588
Isn't that how you get people
to like you?

498
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:46,835
<i>I'm sorry. Okay?</i>

499
00:36:46,903 --> 00:36:49,736
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?

500
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:57,179
<i>Clem?
Your keys.</i>

501
00:36:57,247 --> 00:37:00,182
I was just... I was just...
I won't need them anymore.

502
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,344
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.

503
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,050
Clem?

504
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,024
<i>Got it.</i>

505
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,034
Mary's coming over tonight.

506
00:37:19,102 --> 00:37:20,729
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

507
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,737
<i>Just thought you'd wanna know.</i>

508
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,831
<i>I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.</i>

509
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,469
She likes you okay.

510
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:31,639
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.
I have a girlfriend now.

511
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:34,239
Do whatever you want.
Did I tell you I have...

512
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:36,251
Yeah.

513
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:43,658
Did I tell you
I have a new girlfriend?

514
00:37:43,726 --> 00:37:45,660
We gotta focus here,
Patrick.

515
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:47,662
Yeah, the thing is,

516
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,631
our situation is...
is a little weird.

517
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,691
My girlfriend situation.

518
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,567
I'm sure it is.

519
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:57,629
You gotta be...

520
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,634
Clem, let me drive you home.

521
00:38:25,702 --> 00:38:27,795
<i>Get out of my face, faggot!</i>

522
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:32,767
<i>Look at it out here!
It's all falling apart!</i>

523
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:35,208
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

524
00:38:35,278 --> 00:38:37,212
You did it to me first!

525
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,273
<i>I can't believe
you did this to me.
Goddamn it.</i>

526
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:44,286
Clem! Can you hear me?

527
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,948
By morning you'll be gone!

528
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:50,515
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

529
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:59,327
<i>Is there something wrong
with a girl being attracted to me?
Is that a problem?</i>

530
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:01,927
<i>No, I think it's... funny.</i>

531
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:05,099
<i>So, who do you think's better-looking,
me or this guy?</i>

532
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:07,108
<i>Patrick, let's focus, buddy.</i>

533
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:09,770
<i>Remember that girl
we did last week?</i>

534
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:12,974
<i>The one with the... potatoes?</i>

535
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:18,120
<i>That girl?
That's this guy's girl.</i>

536
00:39:18,187 --> 00:39:20,121
<i>Right.
Yeah.</i>

537
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:23,124
<i>Was. We took care of that.</i>

538
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:25,683
<i>Oh, God!
Well, uh...</i>

539
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:28,629
I kinda fell in love with her
that night.

540
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:31,633
What? You little fuck...

541
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:34,693
What?
She was unconscious, man.

542
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:37,797
Well, she was beautiful, and...

543
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:40,866
I stole a pair of her panties
as well.

544
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,714
Jesus!
What?

545
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:47,716
It's not like...

546
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:50,776
I mean, they were clean and all.
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

547
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:53,287
<i>They were clean!
What? D-Don't! Stop!</i>

548
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,790
<i>Okay. Yeah! All right!
We got work to do.</i>

549
00:39:55,858 --> 00:39:57,849
<i>Give me my papers.</i>

550
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:13,741
<i>There's, um...</i>

551
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:17,102
There's more.

552
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:21,216
After we did her, I kind of...

553
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:24,685
<i>went to where she works
and asked her out.</i>

554
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:28,083
<i>You what?</i>

555
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:30,785
<i>Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick!</i>

556
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:34,820
<i>Do you have... any idea...</i>

557
00:40:34,897 --> 00:40:36,728
how unethical...

558
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:39,734
It's not really that bad.

559
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:42,532
What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

560
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:45,904
<i>Patrick, you stole a girl's panties!</i>

561
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,211
There's someone here.

562
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:02,190
He stole your underwear.

563
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:06,422
I don't see anyone.

564
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:24,970
<i>Joel?</i>

565
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:27,447
<i>Where are my boots?</i>

566
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:30,975
<i>Why are you showing me poisons?
Can't you understand English?</i>

567
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:34,045
"Potions," I said.
Potions.

568
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:42,430
<i>Love potion, please.</i>

569
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:45,399
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

570
00:41:48,538 --> 00:41:51,029
Should've left you
at the flea market.

571
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:55,344
<i>First thing to do is...</i>

572
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:58,403
<i>sift in a cup
of powdered whale heart.</i>

573
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:05,814
Wanna go?

574
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,124
I want to have a baby.

575
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:12,093
Let's talk about it later.

576
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:15,324
No! I want to have a baby.

577
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:19,400
I don't think we're ready.

578
00:42:19,468 --> 00:42:21,493
You're not ready.

579
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:24,802
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

580
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:27,035
What?

581
00:42:28,544 --> 00:42:30,978
I don't wanna
talk about it here.

582
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:33,811
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

583
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:36,317
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!

584
00:42:36,385 --> 00:42:38,819
<i>We're fucking
gonna talk about it!
I... don't... want... to...</i>

585
00:42:38,888 --> 00:42:41,482
You can't just say something like that
and say you don't wanna talk about it!

586
00:42:41,557 --> 00:42:44,492
I'm sorry, Clem.
I'd make a fucking good mother!

587
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,997
I love children, I'm creative and smart,
and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God... Mmm!

588
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:52,432
<i>It's you, Joel. It's you
who can't commit to anything!</i>

589
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:56,198
It's going! It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are
I'm interested in you!

590
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:59,207
Maybe I should end this
right here, Joel!

591
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:02,642
Leave you at the flea market
with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done. This is crap.

592
00:43:02,712 --> 00:43:06,204
Maybe you could find yourself
an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion...

593
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:16,819
Oh. Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

594
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:19,828
<i>Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.</i>

595
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:21,727
<i>Find us okay?
Yeah.</i>

596
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,592
Mmm.
Hot!

597
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:30,738
Poor guy.

598
00:43:30,806 --> 00:43:33,536
Mmm? Oh.

599
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:35,839
Don't you have
anything real to drink?

600
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:38,847
<i>Uh, we haven't really
checked yet.</i>

601
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:40,849
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.

602
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,317
Uh, let me do the honors.

603
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,554
Mary hates me.

604
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:49,284
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

605
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:51,292
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

606
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,386
<i>Stan. Stan.</i>

607
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:55,896
There's more.
No!

608
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:57,262
Yes.
No!

609
00:43:57,333 --> 00:44:01,235
Hey, hey!

610
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:04,239
Oh, you didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

611
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:06,901
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.

612
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:11,276
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

613
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:15,283
Oh.

614
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,285
Oh!
Oh!

615
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:20,117
Mmm!

616
00:44:22,124 --> 00:44:25,560
<i>That's Nietzsche.
Beyond Good and Evil.</i>

617
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:27,892
<i>I found it in my Bartlett's.</i>

618
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:29,898
<i>What's your Bartlett's?</i>

619
00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:31,866
It's a quote book, Patrick.

620
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:33,834
It's a book of quotations.

621
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:36,394
<i>I think Howard
will be in Bartlett's
one day.</i>

622
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:38,406
<i>Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.</i>

623
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:40,840
<i>God!</i>

624
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,470
Can you wake him up?

625
00:44:43,546 --> 00:44:45,480
<i>You can't wake him up.</i>

626
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,709
Mmm.

627
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:57,048
You don't tell me things, Joel.

628
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:00,528
I'm an open book.

629
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:03,698
I tell you everything.

630
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:06,997
Every damn embarrassing thing.

631
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:11,698
You don't trust me.

632
00:45:11,774 --> 00:45:15,301
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

633
00:45:17,747 --> 00:45:19,738
I don't do that.

634
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:24,209
I want to know you.

635
00:45:25,388 --> 00:45:27,322
Hmm?

636
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,416
I don't constantly talk.
Jesus!

637
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:34,455
People have to
share things, Joel.

638
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,464
Mm-hmm.

639
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:38,625
That's what intimacy is.

640
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:41,636
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

641
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:43,638
I'm sorry.

642
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:46,698
It just... really just
isn't that interesting.

643
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,845
<i>I wanna read some of those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.</i>

644
00:45:50,913 --> 00:45:54,076
<i>What do you write in there
if you don't have any thoughts
or passions or...</i>

645
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,141
<i>love?</i>

646
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:08,021
<i>November 19, 2003.</i>

647
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:10,759
<i>Dinner at Kang's again.</i>

648
00:46:13,169 --> 00:46:16,104
<i>Are we like those poor couples...</i>

649
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:18,902
<i>you feel sorry for in restaurants?</i>

650
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:21,340
<i>Are we the dining dead?</i>

651
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:26,109
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

652
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:32,520
I like that.

653
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:35,790
How's the chicken?

654
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:37,849
Good.

655
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:42,230
More?
No. No. Thank you.

656
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:47,701
<i>She's gonna be drunk
and stupid now.</i>

657
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,204
Hey, would you
do me a favor...

658
00:46:50,272 --> 00:46:53,241
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

659
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:55,243
<i>Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
It's really...</i>

660
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:57,404
- Gross.
- gross.

661
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:02,206
- It's just...
- Repulsive.

662
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:03,945
It's repulsive.

663
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:12,387
<i>Patrick, can we get through this?</i>

664
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:14,224
Patrick.

665
00:47:14,296 --> 00:47:16,230
<i>Hey, Tangerine.</i>

666
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:19,426
<i>Oh, Patrick, it's you.</i>

667
00:47:19,502 --> 00:47:21,766
<i>I'm so miserable right now.</i>

668
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:24,237
<i>Why? What's wrong?
I don't know.</i>

669
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:26,240
<i>Excuse me?
I'm so confused!</i>

670
00:47:26,308 --> 00:47:28,242
<i>Can I help you
find something, sir?</i>

671
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,302
<i>Confused? What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.</i>

672
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:34,248
Baby, come here.

673
00:47:34,316 --> 00:47:36,307
<i>Scared of what?</i>

674
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:43,415
<i>Do you love me?
Of course I do.</i>

675
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:45,426
Where's the self-help section?

676
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:47,962
<i>Do you think I'm ugly?</i>

677
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,464
<i>No! You're beautiful!</i>

678
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:52,797
<i>Maybe I should come over.
No, no.</i>

679
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:55,803
<i>I don't know.
I- I'm a mess, Patrick.</i>

680
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:58,567
<i>Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.</i>

681
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:00,506
<i>Okay.</i>

682
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:03,773
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend's really upset.

683
00:48:03,846 --> 00:48:06,041
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's...

684
00:48:06,115 --> 00:48:08,049
Let him go, Stan!

685
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:11,052
Let him go. I'll help.

686
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,054
<i>See?
How hard can it be?</i>

687
00:48:13,122 --> 00:48:16,819
<i>- She hates me.
She wants me to go.
- Go.</i>

688
00:48:16,892 --> 00:48:19,793
All right.
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

689
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:21,557
You like?

690
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,690
Oh, man!

691
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:26,735
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

692
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:28,736
<i>I like it.
You do?</i>

693
00:48:28,804 --> 00:48:31,034
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!

694
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:34,564
"Clemen-teen" the tangerine.
Mmm! Juicy!

695
00:48:34,643 --> 00:48:37,134
And seedless.
I like that.

696
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:41,015
I like tangerines!

697
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,244
Can you see me doing ducks?

698
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:46,220
Tangerine.
Joel. Ducks.
Quack-quack.

699
00:48:46,288 --> 00:48:49,223
How does he know
to call you that?
How did who know?

700
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:52,055
<i>Oh, my God. Clem?
This is pretty cool.</i>

701
00:48:52,127 --> 00:48:54,061
That's what
they called themselves.

702
00:48:54,129 --> 00:48:56,563
The Clash...
the only band that mattered.

703
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:58,566
They called themselves that
for a reason.

704
00:48:58,634 --> 00:49:02,001
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice...
Yeah, it's totally incredible.

705
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:04,596
What Howard
gives to the world.

706
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:07,701
Yeah.

707
00:49:07,776 --> 00:49:10,210
To let people begin again.

708
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:14,215
It's beautiful.

709
00:49:14,283 --> 00:49:19,220
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure and so free
and so clean.

710
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:22,724
And adults are, like,
this mess of sadness...

711
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,589
and... phobias.

712
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:28,721
Howard just makes it all go away.

713
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,598
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

714
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:45,313
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!

715
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:47,781
I'm lost, I'm scared,

716
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,784
I feel like I'm disappearing.

717
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:52,787
<i>Disappearing?
My skin's coming off!
I'm getting old!</i>

718
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:55,790
<i>Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.</i>

719
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:59,089
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.

720
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:01,459
Nothing makes any sense.

721
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:05,159
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It's okay. It's okay.

722
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:09,261
Hey, let's go out dancing. Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

723
00:50:09,338 --> 00:50:11,272
Montauk?
Yeah.

724
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,037
No! Come up to Boston with me.
Sure. Yeah.
We can go next weekend.

725
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,341
No, no. Now. Now.
Yeah. I have to go now.

726
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:20,848
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

727
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,854
<i>Hi, it's Joel.</i>

728
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:32,121
<i>Um, leave a message after the beep
and I'll get back to you.</i>

729
00:50:34,196 --> 00:50:36,630
<i>Pick up! Pick up, man!</i>

730
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:39,497
W-W-W-W-Whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

731
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:44,004
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

732
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:47,167
<i>I got into a little situation
with the old lady.</i>

733
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:50,006
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I'm really sorry, man.

734
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,014
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.

735
00:50:53,082 --> 00:50:56,643
He's pretty much on autopilot
right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

736
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,449
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

737
00:51:01,323 --> 00:51:03,314
Charles.

738
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:07,452
Come on, Charles.

739
00:51:12,067 --> 00:51:16,401
"Look! You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.

740
00:51:16,472 --> 00:51:20,670
I'm just happy.
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want..."

741
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:25,306
<i>I'm so excited. Yea.
I'm excited too!</i>

742
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:29,249
Cool.
Oh, uh, I, uh...

743
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:32,185
I got you this...

744
00:51:32,254 --> 00:51:35,314
<i>What?
thing, um...</i>

745
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:37,325
Happy early Valentine's Day.

746
00:51:37,393 --> 00:51:39,384
Oh!

747
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:42,854
Wow. What is it?

748
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:45,422
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.

749
00:51:50,973 --> 00:51:52,907
Oh.

750
00:51:52,975 --> 00:51:54,909
It... It's gorgeous!

751
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:57,912
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

752
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:02,349
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

753
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:04,409
Thank you.

754
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,361
Let's go.
Okay.

755
00:52:13,796 --> 00:52:16,697
Joely?
Yeah, Tangerine?

756
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,858
<i>Am I ugly?</i>

757
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:24,372
<i>Mm-mmm.
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.</i>

758
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,536
Can't believe I'm crying already.

759
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:34,446
<i>Sometimes I think people
don't understand how lonely it is
to be a kid.</i>

760
00:52:34,516 --> 00:52:37,542
<i>Like you don't matter.</i>

761
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,952
<i>So, I'm eight...</i>

762
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:43,287
<i>and I have these toys,</i>

763
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:45,292
<i>these dolls.</i>

764
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,093
<i>My favorite is this ugly girl doll
who I call Clementine.</i>

765
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:52,099
<i>And I keep yelling at her:</i>

766
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:56,501
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

767
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:58,597
<i>It's weird.</i>

768
00:52:58,674 --> 00:53:01,700
<i>Like if I can transform her,</i>

769
00:53:01,777 --> 00:53:04,405
<i>I would magically change too.</i>

770
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:11,085
You're pretty.

771
00:53:11,153 --> 00:53:14,316
Joely, don't ever leave me.

772
00:53:14,389 --> 00:53:18,416
Pretty. Pretty.
Pretty. Pretty.

773
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:22,430
<i>Mierzwiak, please
let me keep this memory.</i>

774
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:24,432
<i>Just this one.</i>

775
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,435
<i>I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.</i>

776
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:29,198
Whoo!
Whoa!

777
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:31,205
Stop it!

778
00:53:34,643 --> 00:53:37,305
I could die right now, Clem.

779
00:53:38,547 --> 00:53:40,538
I'm just...

780
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:44,512
happy.

781
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:49,083
I've never felt that before.

782
00:53:50,225 --> 00:53:52,159
Mmm.

783
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:54,218
I'm just exactly...

784
00:53:56,465 --> 00:53:58,456
where I wanna be.

785
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:01,526
Clem?

786
00:54:07,743 --> 00:54:10,234
I wanna call it off.

787
00:54:10,312 --> 00:54:12,303
I'll give you a sign.

788
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:18,643
I wanna call it off!

789
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:23,991
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!

790
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:26,425
I wanna call it off!

791
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:36,233
Is anybody there?

792
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:45,135
<i>Clementine?
Joel?</i>

793
00:54:45,213 --> 00:54:47,443
<i>Clement...
Joely?</i>

794
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:49,609
<i>Clem!
Joel?</i>

795
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:52,483
Clem!

796
00:54:52,554 --> 00:54:54,784
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

797
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:57,290
What? Where?
I have an idea
of how to stop this.

798
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,691
Stop what?

799
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:01,695
Joely.
Come on, Clem.

800
00:55:01,763 --> 00:55:05,062
Smell my armpit!
Smell my armpit!
No!

801
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:07,693
Don't tickle me!
Don't make me smell you.
Smell my pits!

802
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:09,703
No.
Good.

803
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,137
Concentrate, Clem.

804
00:55:12,207 --> 00:55:14,698
<i>We gotta get back
to the office.</i>

805
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:17,301
<i>There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.</i>

806
00:55:17,379 --> 00:55:19,404
Not the picture.

807
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:22,541
Where is it? Back here.
Come on!

808
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:25,280
<i>Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.</i>

809
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:29,051
<i>Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,</i>

810
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:31,058
<i>so I can't show you evidence.</i>

811
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:34,527
<i>Suffice it to say that Miss, uh...
Miss Kruczynski...</i>

812
00:55:34,596 --> 00:55:38,464
<i>was not happy
and she wanted to move on.</i>

813
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:43,061
<i>Good. Now, tell me about Clementine.
Just tell me everything you remember.</i>

814
00:55:43,138 --> 00:55:46,005
That's what he said. Then...
What did we see that day?

815
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:48,008
No, wait.
Oh, look! Hey!

816
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:50,567
Shit!
We're going to see
my grandma.

817
00:55:50,646 --> 00:55:53,342
Joel, why... No, I don't want to...
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.

818
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:56,179
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!

819
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:58,583
Mierzwiak!

820
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:01,623
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!

821
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:12,933
Please.

822
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:16,368
So, why don't we begin
by you telling me...

823
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:18,531
<i>everything you can remember.</i>

824
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:21,098
<i>Mierzwiak! Wake me up!</i>

825
00:56:21,176 --> 00:56:24,202
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

826
00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:27,271
<i>I thought you understood
what was going on here.</i>

827
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:30,512
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

828
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:33,520
You're erasing me from her...

829
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:37,992
I don't know.

830
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,723
You've got this thing.
I'm in my bed. I know it.

831
00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:43,731
I'm in my brain.

832
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:46,700
<i>I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.</i>

833
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:49,396
How can I help you
from there?

834
00:56:49,471 --> 00:56:52,963
<i>Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.</i>

835
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:56,670
<i>Sorry.</i>

836
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:58,804
Look. Who's that?

837
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,939
Oh, he-he works for us.

838
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:05,680
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

839
00:57:05,754 --> 00:57:08,348
<i>baby boy.</i>

840
00:57:08,423 --> 00:57:10,914
He's stealing my identity.

841
00:57:10,992 --> 00:57:13,392
He stole my stuff.

842
00:57:13,462 --> 00:57:17,159
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

843
00:57:17,232 --> 00:57:20,429
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!

844
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:22,436
He stole her underwear.

845
00:57:22,504 --> 00:57:25,905
I could die right now, Clem.

846
00:57:25,974 --> 00:57:28,442
I'm just happy.

847
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:33,106
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where
I want to be.

848
00:57:34,649 --> 00:57:36,640
I want to go home.

849
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:39,687
Hey. What?

850
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:45,753
Clem!

851
00:57:45,827 --> 00:57:47,818
Wait. Clem!

852
00:57:48,897 --> 00:57:51,092
Clem?

853
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,634
<i>They're erasing you.</i>

854
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:55,636
I'm here!

855
00:57:55,704 --> 00:57:58,366
Clem, focus.
I hired them, okay?

856
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,374
I'm so stupid.

857
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:03,468
Sweetie, calm down.
Enjoy the scenery.

858
00:58:03,545 --> 00:58:06,878
<i>I need it to stop before I wake up
and I don't know you anymore.</i>

859
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:12,749
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

860
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:16,052
What the hell are you talking about?
I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

861
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:17,887
Wake yourself up!

862
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:20,723
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

863
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:23,697
<i>Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.</i>

864
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:26,791
I'll try really hard. Here we go.
That was a great idea.

865
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:28,995
Yeah. Okay.

866
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,301
<i>Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.</i>

867
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:34,899
<i>Don't! That tickles me!
Oh, my goodness.</i>

868
00:58:34,976 --> 00:58:37,410
<i>Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ! What the...</i>

869
00:58:37,479 --> 00:58:39,413
<i>It's a birthmark!</i>

870
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:45,982
It did work, for a second,

871
00:58:46,054 --> 00:58:48,579
<i>but I couldn't...
I couldn't move.
See?</i>

872
00:58:48,657 --> 00:58:53,321
Oh, well, isn't that just another one
of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

873
00:58:53,395 --> 00:58:55,727
It's more important
to prove me wrong
than to actually...

874
00:58:55,797 --> 00:58:58,960
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

875
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:02,367
Fine.

876
00:59:02,437 --> 00:59:05,429
Then what? I'm listening.

877
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:08,203
I don't know.
You erased me.

878
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:10,938
That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this
in the first place.

879
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:12,946
I'm sorry.
You... You!

880
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:15,448
You know me. I'm impulsive.

881
00:59:18,753 --> 00:59:20,846
That's what I love
about you.

882
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:26,150
<i>Joel?</i>

883
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:29,197
<i>Mm-hmm?
I have another idea
for this problem.</i>

884
00:59:29,264 --> 00:59:31,528
This is a memory of me,

885
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:36,299
the way you wanted
to have sex on the couch after you
looked down at my crotch.

886
00:59:36,371 --> 00:59:39,306
What?
Joel, the eraser guys
are coming here,

887
00:59:39,374 --> 00:59:42,366
so what if you take me
somewhere else,

888
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:44,605
somewhere
where I don't belong,

889
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:47,239
and we hide there
till morning?

890
00:59:51,653 --> 00:59:55,054
Oh, man. I can't remember
anything without you.

891
00:59:55,123 --> 00:59:58,286
Tsk, that's very sweet,
but try, okay?

892
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,294
Okay.

893
01:00:24,653 --> 01:00:26,712
It's working!

894
01:00:26,788 --> 01:00:30,349
<i>I'm a genius!</i>

895
01:00:50,845 --> 01:00:52,779
<i>Joel?</i>

896
01:00:52,847 --> 01:00:55,042
Joel?

897
01:00:56,785 --> 01:00:58,946
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

898
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,817
I'm supposed to come too!

899
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:04,416
<i>Listen, I'm just gonna
go get a salad bowl. Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?</i>

900
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:06,426
<i>Sure.
He just likes to be near me.</i>

901
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:08,462
<i>Absolutely!
Clem?</i>

902
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:12,694
<i>It worked.
My God, look at this! Wow!</i>

903
01:01:12,767 --> 01:01:16,931
<i>It worked! Look!
Look at this dress, man!</i>

904
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:21,567
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

905
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:24,043
Who am I?

906
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:26,012
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

907
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:28,641
I must be about four.
Oh, my gosh.

908
01:01:28,717 --> 01:01:32,016
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

909
01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:34,578
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

910
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:38,353
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

911
01:01:38,426 --> 01:01:41,486
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?
No, not at all.

912
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:44,088
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.

913
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:47,157
<i>Thank you so much.
She's not looking at me.</i>

914
01:01:47,235 --> 01:01:50,363
She's busy.
She's not looking at me.

915
01:01:50,438 --> 01:01:53,771
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.

916
01:01:53,842 --> 01:01:56,834
<i>Oh, baby Joel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!</i>

917
01:01:56,911 --> 01:01:59,436
<i>Is every little peanut
under there okay?
Mm-hmm! He's fine.</i>

918
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:01,846
Do you have something to drink?

919
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:04,578
<i>Would you drink
a cocktail at this hour?
I mean, I know it's not 5:00.</i>

920
01:02:04,652 --> 01:02:07,143
I would die for a vodka.
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.

921
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:09,952
Okay! I'm just
gonna wait right here.
Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

922
01:02:10,025 --> 01:02:11,959
<i>Uh, Joely.</i>

923
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:15,656
<i>Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.
Ice cream.</i>

924
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:20,099
<i>Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know,
you've had your dinner.</i>

925
01:02:20,168 --> 01:02:22,193
<i>Come on, Joel!</i>

926
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,204
<i>Joel, grow up!</i>

927
01:02:24,272 --> 01:02:26,638
<i>Don't leave me, Clem.
Oh, my God, Clem.</i>

928
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,142
<i>This is sort of warped.
I'm scared.</i>

929
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:32,509
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.

930
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:36,880
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

931
01:02:36,951 --> 01:02:39,749
<i>Stop it! Look, I think it's working.
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look!</i>

932
01:02:39,821 --> 01:02:42,654
Hey, honey, look.

933
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:44,715
Wait there.

934
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:50,826
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

935
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:52,833
Yuck.

936
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:58,995
It stopped.

937
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:02,805
What?
It stopped erasing.

938
01:03:02,877 --> 01:03:05,311
Oh, shit.

939
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,371
This is terrible.

940
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,215
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

941
01:03:11,286 --> 01:03:14,847
<i>Where?
I don't know where!
What do you mean? I don't know where!</i>

942
01:03:14,923 --> 01:03:19,019
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?

943
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:21,654
Okay. Crap.

944
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:24,493
Okay. What do we do?
What do I do?

945
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:27,126
<i>What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.</i>

946
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:29,432
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!

947
01:03:29,504 --> 01:03:32,132
- I just said that I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry. What do we do?

948
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:35,802
<i>I don't know.
Now, look, you're freaking me out.
Mellow out.</i>

949
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:39,711
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half-baked.

950
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:42,807
Quiet. You're freaking me out.
Shh. Shh.

951
01:03:42,884 --> 01:03:45,876
All gooey and... and half-baked.
Hmm, that sounds so good.

952
01:03:45,954 --> 01:03:47,888
<i>Oh, shit!
I'm hungry.</i>

953
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:49,890
<i>Oh, shit.
Oh! Oh!</i>

954
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:52,426
What? Oh! What, what?
What?

955
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:55,429
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

956
01:03:55,497 --> 01:03:57,658
This is my...
I can handle this.

957
01:03:57,732 --> 01:04:00,030
<i>I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.</i>

958
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:02,797
He's... There's no time
to fuck around.

959
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:05,362
I got this under control.
What are you talking about?

960
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,307
<i>Stop fucking around!
Okay, I'll call Howard.</i>

961
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:19,417
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Hey, it's Stan.

962
01:04:19,487 --> 01:04:23,321
Um, I'm working on this guy
down here, and we seem to have
lost him for a moment,

963
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:26,155
and, uh, I can't...
I can't bring him back up.

964
01:04:26,227 --> 01:04:29,663
Okay, uh, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

965
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:33,132
Well, I wasn't sure, really,
'cause I was away from the monitor
for a minute...

966
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:35,897
and I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh...

967
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,904
I had to pee.

968
01:04:37,972 --> 01:04:41,669
Where's Patrick?
Patrick? Patrick had to
go home sick.

969
01:04:41,743 --> 01:04:43,677
Ah, geez.

970
01:04:43,745 --> 01:04:46,509
Okay, what's the address?
I know. I'm so sorry.

971
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:50,278
<i>That's okay. Come on.
I'm at 159 South Village.</i>

972
01:04:50,351 --> 01:04:53,514
<i>Yeah.
Apartment 1 E.
Rockville Center.</i>

973
01:04:53,588 --> 01:04:56,250
<i>Mary?
He's coming right now.
Yeah?</i>

974
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:58,258
<i>I'm staying.</i>

975
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,692
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.

976
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:03,253
I think you should go.
Hell, no.

977
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:06,926
Mary... Shit.

978
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,994
<i>I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.</i>

979
01:05:11,072 --> 01:05:13,438
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.

980
01:05:13,508 --> 01:05:16,306
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

981
01:05:16,377 --> 01:05:20,541
<i>Mary, you have no idea how much trouble
we're gonna get into if Howard comes...
I look like shit!</i>

982
01:05:20,615 --> 01:05:23,812
<i>Joely, stop it! Joel!
Look! Hey, Joel!</i>

983
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:31,715
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.

984
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:35,320
It's weird how strong
that desire is.
Joel, look at me! Look.

985
01:05:35,396 --> 01:05:37,728
You'll remember me
in the morning,

986
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:40,962
and you'll come to me,
and you'll tell me about us,
and we'll start over.

987
01:05:41,035 --> 01:05:43,401
Pat? I just... Pat?

988
01:05:43,471 --> 01:05:45,632
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

989
01:05:45,707 --> 01:05:48,175
That Patrick guy...
he's copying me.

990
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:50,234
What Patrick guy?

991
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:52,074
That guy!
What?

992
01:05:52,146 --> 01:05:54,011
He's here in my apartment.

993
01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:56,016
He's one of those eraser guys.

994
01:05:56,084 --> 01:06:00,418
He fell for you when they were doing you,
and now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

995
01:06:00,488 --> 01:06:02,820
and you guys are dating.

996
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:06,121
Really? Is he cute?

997
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,929
Clem,
there's nothing wrong with you.

998
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:13,593
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

999
01:06:13,668 --> 01:06:16,603
You... You're kind,

1000
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:18,901
beautiful...

1001
01:06:18,973 --> 01:06:21,203
and smart and funny...

1002
01:06:21,276 --> 01:06:23,506
and... nice.

1003
01:06:23,578 --> 01:06:25,808
What?

1004
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:29,482
Okay. All right.

1005
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:33,317
Okay. Oh!

1006
01:06:33,388 --> 01:06:35,686
Move, move, move!
Come on. Let's go.
Careful, careful.

1007
01:06:35,757 --> 01:06:37,554
Fine.

1008
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:41,026
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1009
01:06:41,095 --> 01:06:43,495
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

1010
01:06:48,236 --> 01:06:50,170
Be cool. Cool.

1011
01:06:54,742 --> 01:06:57,040
<i>Hello, Mary.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.</i>

1012
01:06:57,111 --> 01:06:59,045
She was just here to help out.

1013
01:06:59,113 --> 01:07:02,276
I wanted to understand as much
as I could about the procedure
as possible.

1014
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:06,047
I think it's important for my job
to understand the inner workings...

1015
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,315
<i>of the work that we do.</i>

1016
01:07:08,389 --> 01:07:11,085
<i>Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...</i>

1017
01:07:11,159 --> 01:07:14,856
by people... where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

1018
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:17,955
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,

1019
01:07:18,032 --> 01:07:20,592
get to the bottom of this,
shall we?

1020
01:07:20,668 --> 01:07:22,659
Uh, yeah. Um...

1021
01:07:25,406 --> 01:07:27,874
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.

1022
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:31,708
<i>Did you try going
through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.</i>

1023
01:07:31,779 --> 01:07:33,576
I mean... yes.

1024
01:07:33,648 --> 01:07:35,878
Yeah.

1025
01:07:38,086 --> 01:07:40,020
All right.

1026
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:43,490
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

1027
01:07:43,558 --> 01:07:45,856
All right.

1028
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:48,555
I already... I ran
the utility programs,

1029
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:50,620
and I had nothing there,

1030
01:07:50,698 --> 01:07:53,690
so I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1031
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:55,759
<i>Here, Howard.
Okay.</i>

1032
01:07:55,837 --> 01:07:58,237
I got you a chair.
There you go.
Oh, thank you.

1033
01:07:58,306 --> 01:08:00,866
You're welcome.
Whew!

1034
01:08:00,942 --> 01:08:04,537
All right, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go through
the entire memory,

1035
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:06,603
<i>see if something comes up.</i>

1036
01:08:13,354 --> 01:08:15,845
I love being bathed in the sink.

1037
01:08:15,923 --> 01:08:18,414
Such a feeling of security.

1038
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:21,724
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.
Hmm!

1039
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:23,730
There it is.

1040
01:08:23,798 --> 01:08:28,132
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1041
01:08:28,202 --> 01:08:30,261
What the heck
was he doing there?

1042
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:41,838
<i>His eyes are open.</i>

1043
01:08:43,718 --> 01:08:47,313
<i>- Has this happened before with him?
- No.</i>

1044
01:08:47,388 --> 01:08:50,949
Oh, this is...
this is not good. No.

1045
01:08:51,025 --> 01:08:53,255
I'm gonna have to...

1046
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:55,261
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1047
01:09:19,687 --> 01:09:22,315
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1048
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:25,553
<i>Okay, we're back in.</i>

1049
01:09:25,626 --> 01:09:29,858
<i>Wow. That was beautiful
to watch, Howard.</i>

1050
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:33,958
Like a surgeon
or a concert pianist
or something.

1051
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:35,969
Thank you, Mary.

1052
01:09:36,037 --> 01:09:40,133
Um, Howard,
you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

1053
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:44,770
<i>Why can't you see I love you,
Antoine?</i>

1054
01:09:44,846 --> 01:09:46,837
Hmm. Lucky me.

1055
01:09:46,914 --> 01:09:51,317
Lay one on me.

1056
01:09:52,453 --> 01:09:54,580
Don't call me Antoine.

1057
01:09:54,655 --> 01:09:57,055
<i>My name is Wally.
Yes, I know,</i>

1058
01:09:57,124 --> 01:09:59,684
<i>but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?</i>

1059
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,160
<i>Oh! Oh! What was that?</i>

1060
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:04,926
<i>Hey.
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.</i>

1061
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:07,490
<i>There is?</i>

1062
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:11,104
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

1063
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:14,198
What, Joel... What are you doing?
We gotta go.

1064
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:16,937
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!

1065
01:10:19,814 --> 01:10:21,679
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1066
01:10:21,749 --> 01:10:23,546
Clem, come on!

1067
01:10:24,585 --> 01:10:26,519
There I am.

1068
01:10:26,587 --> 01:10:28,521
That truck.

1069
01:10:28,589 --> 01:10:31,490
Doc? Please.

1070
01:10:31,559 --> 01:10:35,689
<i>All right, let's begin
by you telling me...</i>

1071
01:10:35,763 --> 01:10:38,527
everything you remember...

1072
01:10:38,599 --> 01:10:42,501
That's strange.
He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1073
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:46,631
Oh, well, at least
we know where he is.
He's back on track, right?

1074
01:10:46,707 --> 01:10:48,641
Come on, Clem.

1075
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:51,735
<i>He seems to have developed some sort
of resistance to the procedure.</i>

1076
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:54,406
<i>I don't want to run anymore.
Shit.</i>

1077
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:00,011
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.

1078
01:11:00,087 --> 01:11:02,817
Where?
Hide me in your humiliation.

1079
01:11:03,991 --> 01:11:06,585
<i>Humiliation.
Come on, you big baby!</i>

1080
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:08,595
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

1081
01:11:12,133 --> 01:11:14,966
<i>Let me drive you home.</i>

1082
01:11:15,036 --> 01:11:17,470
No!

1083
01:11:17,538 --> 01:11:20,996
<i>- Bye, Howard.
- No, wait. Howard.</i>

1084
01:11:21,075 --> 01:11:23,339
He's disappeared again.

1085
01:11:23,411 --> 01:11:27,609
<i>Oh, dear.
I'm so sorry, Howard.</i>

1086
01:11:27,682 --> 01:11:29,673
Humiliation.

1087
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:32,378
Humiliation.

1088
01:11:32,453 --> 01:11:35,445
Hu-mi-lia...
Joel.

1089
01:11:35,523 --> 01:11:37,684
I don't like it either.

1090
01:11:37,758 --> 01:11:40,283
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to...

1091
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:43,330
Joel, honey, I have a surprise...
I just... Oh, um...

1092
01:11:43,397 --> 01:11:46,230
<i>Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.</i>

1093
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,133
<i>Good night, sweetheart.</i>

1094
01:11:49,203 --> 01:11:51,535
No.

1095
01:11:51,606 --> 01:11:54,598
<i>I'm sorry, Joel. Joely.
Shut up.</i>

1096
01:11:55,843 --> 01:11:58,710
Look! Joel!

1097
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:00,713
Joel, look!
What?

1098
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:02,715
Look where we are!

1099
01:12:02,783 --> 01:12:05,217
Whoo!

1100
01:12:05,286 --> 01:12:07,720
Clem, this isn't good.

1101
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:11,656
<i>Then hide me somewhere...
somewhere really buried.</i>

1102
01:12:14,428 --> 01:12:17,158
Hit it! Hit it!
I can't! I gotta go home.

1103
01:12:17,231 --> 01:12:19,631
<i>I'll do it later!</i>

1104
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:26,295
Come on, you big sissy!

1105
01:12:34,582 --> 01:12:36,846
<i>Ooh!</i>

1106
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:40,011
<i>Ooh, he has a girlfriend!</i>

1107
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:42,749
<i>Wait. What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her!</i>

1108
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:45,018
You don't scare me anymore.
Ow! Ow!

1109
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:47,083
Joel!

1110
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:49,994
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.
Hit him! Hit him!

1111
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:54,626
They're not worth it, Joel!
Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

1112
01:12:54,702 --> 01:12:56,761
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!

1113
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:06,744
<i>I'm so ashamed.
It's okay.</i>

1114
01:13:06,814 --> 01:13:09,078
<i>You were a little kid.
Yeah?</i>

1115
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,778
<i>Come on.
That's where I live... lived.</i>

1116
01:13:11,852 --> 01:13:14,116
<i>I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.</i>

1117
01:13:14,188 --> 01:13:17,885
<i>Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.</i>

1118
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:20,586
<i>It's my turn.
Go. One, two, three.
I can? You're really gonna die though.</i>

1119
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:22,891
<i>Okay.
One, two, three.</i>

1120
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:25,454
<i>You're dead.</i>

1121
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:28,798
<i>Oh, my mom.
It's... It's okay. We're playing.</i>

1122
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:31,565
<i>Hi, Joel's mom.
He's killing me.
It's not real.</i>

1123
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:33,869
<i>Okay, are you dead yet?</i>

1124
01:13:33,941 --> 01:13:36,068
<i>You're dead!</i>

1125
01:13:36,143 --> 01:13:38,077
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.

1126
01:13:38,145 --> 01:13:41,376
I still don't understand it,
but I'm finding him quickly enough.

1127
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:58,762
<i>Clem!</i>

1128
01:13:59,767 --> 01:14:02,065
Clem!

1129
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:18,985
Jo... Joely?

1130
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:21,180
Are you okay, Joel?

1131
01:14:21,255 --> 01:14:23,519
Joel? Joel?

1132
01:14:23,591 --> 01:14:26,458
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.

1133
01:14:26,527 --> 01:14:28,461
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.

1134
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:32,431
<i>All right.
Let me do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.</i>

1135
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,435
Okay.

1136
01:14:43,177 --> 01:14:45,338
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

1137
01:14:45,412 --> 01:14:47,744
Look at this.
This is so cool!

1138
01:14:47,815 --> 01:14:49,976
Cool. Look out! Look out!

1139
01:14:51,085 --> 01:14:53,019
Ah!

1140
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,078
Shit!
It's fluff.

1141
01:14:56,657 --> 01:14:58,648
Our house!

1142
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,155
<i>Come on. Whoo-hoo!
Come on.</i>

1143
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:04,163
Come on.
We gotta go!

1144
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:06,825
Whoo!

1145
01:15:06,901 --> 01:15:08,892
Come on!

1146
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,870
We gotta go. Clem?

1147
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:14,840
We gotta go.

1148
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:16,809
Aah! Come on!

1149
01:15:16,877 --> 01:15:19,072
No!
This is a really bad time
for this!

1150
01:15:19,146 --> 01:15:22,081
Get off me! Oh, God!

1151
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:25,084
I don't even know
where we're going.
It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1152
01:15:25,152 --> 01:15:27,677
It's the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.

1153
01:15:27,755 --> 01:15:32,385
No, no, no. This way.
You're no help at all.

1154
01:15:32,459 --> 01:15:35,189
What's wrong with you?

1155
01:15:35,262 --> 01:15:38,425
Let go of me, Joel!

1156
01:15:50,444 --> 01:15:52,071
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1157
01:15:56,183 --> 01:15:58,674
I guess, uh...

1158
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:01,550
I guess I'll go out
for... for some air,

1159
01:16:01,622 --> 01:16:03,613
if nobody minds.

1160
01:16:03,691 --> 01:16:06,888
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

1161
01:16:06,961 --> 01:16:08,895
Yeah, that's, uh...

1162
01:16:08,963 --> 01:16:10,897
<i>that's fine.</i>

1163
01:16:20,608 --> 01:16:23,600
<i>Do you like quotes, Howard?</i>

1164
01:16:24,678 --> 01:16:26,612
What do you mean?

1165
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,376
<i>Oh, you know,
like famous quotes?</i>

1166
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:31,611
I find reading them inspirational,

1167
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:35,587
and in my reading,
I've come across some
I thought you might like too.

1168
01:16:35,656 --> 01:16:39,319
Oh, well, I...
I'd love to hear some.

1169
01:16:39,393 --> 01:16:41,827
<i>There's one that goes,</i>

1170
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:45,388
"Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better
even of their blunders."

1171
01:16:45,466 --> 01:16:47,400
<i>That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.</i>

1172
01:16:47,468 --> 01:16:50,460
And here I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.
Oh, no.

1173
01:16:50,537 --> 01:16:53,665
It's... It's a good quote.
I'm happy we both know it.

1174
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,733
Yeah. Oh, and there's
this other one I like.

1175
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:59,643
It's by Pope Alexander,
and it goes...

1176
01:16:59,713 --> 01:17:02,181
<i>Alexander Pope?
Oh, yeah.</i>

1177
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:04,183
<i>Yeah, shit.</i>

1178
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:08,085
<i>It's just that I told myself
not to say "Pope Alexander"
and sound like a dope,</i>

1179
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:10,146
and then I go ahead and say it.

1180
01:17:10,224 --> 01:17:13,751
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

1181
01:17:15,596 --> 01:17:19,532
<i>The quote goes, "How happy is
the blameless vestal's lot?</i>

1182
01:17:20,768 --> 01:17:23,862
<i>"The world forgetting,
by the world forgot.</i>

1183
01:17:23,938 --> 01:17:28,272
<i>"Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind.</i>

1184
01:17:28,342 --> 01:17:31,903
<i>Each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned."</i>

1185
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:36,939
<i>I want to be
a great big, huge elephant...</i>

1186
01:17:37,017 --> 01:17:39,485
<i>with a huge trunk like that.</i>

1187
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:43,823
Clem? Clementine?

1188
01:17:43,891 --> 01:17:46,860
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1189
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:49,896
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

1190
01:17:54,568 --> 01:17:58,231
I really admire
the work you do, Howard.

1191
01:17:58,305 --> 01:18:00,796
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

1192
01:18:00,874 --> 01:18:03,399
I- I- I- I- I...
I'm happy to hear...

1193
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:10,173
I'm sorry.

1194
01:18:14,221 --> 01:18:16,553
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1195
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:22,159
<i>I shouldn't have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.</i>

1196
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:25,460
<i>It's... You're a wonderful girl.</i>

1197
01:18:25,532 --> 01:18:29,229
But I... You know,
I have a wife and kids.

1198
01:18:29,303 --> 01:18:31,237
You know
I have a wife and kids.

1199
01:18:31,305 --> 01:18:33,239
<i>Oh, Mary.</i>

1200
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:38,243
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1201
01:18:48,255 --> 01:18:50,246
Oh, whoa.

1202
01:18:54,695 --> 01:18:57,960
Well, good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1203
01:19:05,372 --> 01:19:07,363
<i>What?
Oh, my God!</i>

1204
01:19:07,441 --> 01:19:09,966
<i>Who is it?</i>

1205
01:19:14,381 --> 01:19:16,747
Uh...

1206
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:25,654
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1207
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:32,422
Hollis. Hollis!

1208
01:19:32,499 --> 01:19:34,933
<i>Hollis!</i>

1209
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:37,163
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.

1210
01:19:38,472 --> 01:19:40,963
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out
to be like this.

1211
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:44,408
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1212
01:19:44,478 --> 01:19:46,946
<i>I'm a stupid girl
with a stupid crush!
Yeah.</i>

1213
01:19:47,014 --> 01:19:49,505
I swear I basically
forced him into it!

1214
01:19:50,717 --> 01:19:53,345
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1215
01:19:56,023 --> 01:19:58,753
Tell me what?

1216
01:19:58,826 --> 01:20:00,817
Oh, you poor kid.

1217
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:03,922
You can have him.

1218
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:05,931
You did.

1219
01:20:14,441 --> 01:20:16,432
What?

1220
01:20:20,247 --> 01:20:22,238
Oh, uh,

1221
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:30,849
we have a history.

1222
01:20:30,924 --> 01:20:33,484
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1223
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,721
You...

1224
01:20:35,796 --> 01:20:38,287
You wanted it done...

1225
01:20:38,365 --> 01:20:41,664
so you could get past, uh...

1226
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:45,361
You could... Yeah.

1227
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:51,800
Um, I have to, uh,
finish the work in there.

1228
01:20:51,879 --> 01:20:53,870
It's almost morning.

1229
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:57,073
We'll talk later.

1230
01:20:58,085 --> 01:21:00,019
Okay?

1231
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:12,932
<i>Hey.</i>

1232
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:18,861
Let me give you a lift home.

1233
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:31,008
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1234
01:21:31,084 --> 01:21:34,679
Hi.
Hi.

1235
01:21:34,755 --> 01:21:38,691
Didn't figure you'd show your face
around me again.

1236
01:21:38,759 --> 01:21:41,990
I guess I thought
you were... humiliated.

1237
01:21:42,062 --> 01:21:44,030
You did run away,
after all.

1238
01:21:44,097 --> 01:21:46,861
<i>I just needed to see ya.</i>

1239
01:21:46,934 --> 01:21:49,232
Yeah?

1240
01:21:49,303 --> 01:21:52,033
I'd like to, um,

1241
01:21:52,105 --> 01:21:55,074
take you out or something.

1242
01:21:55,142 --> 01:21:57,702
You're married.

1243
01:21:57,778 --> 01:22:00,212
Not yet. Not married.

1244
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,214
No, I'm not married, no.

1245
01:22:02,282 --> 01:22:05,308
Look, man,
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance,

1246
01:22:05,385 --> 01:22:09,947
so I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1247
01:22:10,023 --> 01:22:12,355
or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1248
01:22:12,426 --> 01:22:15,554
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1249
01:22:15,629 --> 01:22:17,790
Okay.

1250
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:20,765
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1251
01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:23,632
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1252
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:27,333
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1253
01:22:27,407 --> 01:22:32,071
Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech
really well.

1254
01:22:32,145 --> 01:22:35,637
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole
human race pegged.

1255
01:22:35,716 --> 01:22:37,707
Hmm. Probably.

1256
01:22:39,886 --> 01:22:42,184
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1257
01:22:42,256 --> 01:22:44,190
even after that.

1258
01:22:44,258 --> 01:22:47,659
Mmm. I know.

1259
01:22:49,997 --> 01:22:51,988
It would be different...

1260
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:55,533
if we could just give it
another go around.

1261
01:22:59,506 --> 01:23:01,872
Remember me.

1262
01:23:01,942 --> 01:23:03,933
Try your best.

1263
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,214
Maybe we can.

1264
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:42,414
Okay, so just tell me
what you remember,

1265
01:23:42,482 --> 01:23:45,076
and, uh, then we'll
take it from there.

1266
01:23:45,152 --> 01:23:47,382
Okay.

1267
01:23:47,454 --> 01:23:50,355
I liked you immediately.

1268
01:23:50,424 --> 01:23:52,915
<i>You didn't
come on to me at all.</i>

1269
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:55,985
<i>I liked that.</i>

1270
01:23:56,063 --> 01:23:59,032
<i>I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.</i>

1271
01:23:59,099 --> 01:24:01,761
<i>I wanted you to think
I was smart.</i>

1272
01:24:02,969 --> 01:24:05,301
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1273
01:24:05,372 --> 01:24:08,864
I had these fantasies
of us being married...

1274
01:24:08,942 --> 01:24:12,309
and having kids and... just...

1275
01:24:12,379 --> 01:24:15,075
<i>Oh, Howie, I can't do this.</i>

1276
01:24:15,148 --> 01:24:17,742
<i>We agreed it's for the best, Mary.</i>

1277
01:24:17,818 --> 01:24:20,286
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1278
01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:22,288
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1279
01:24:22,622 --> 01:24:24,715
I'll take the bottom and you...
Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1280
01:24:24,791 --> 01:24:26,725
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

1281
01:24:26,793 --> 01:24:29,284
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is...

1282
01:24:29,363 --> 01:24:31,957
That's light, huh?
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.

1283
01:24:32,032 --> 01:24:33,966
No, no, no, no!

1284
01:24:34,034 --> 01:24:36,195
Don't take anything.
I can take the plane.

1285
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:39,261
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1286
01:24:41,508 --> 01:24:44,238
<i>This is the day we met.</i>

1287
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:47,508
<i>You were down by the surf.
I could just make you out
in the distance.</i>

1288
01:24:47,581 --> 01:24:49,708
<i>I remember being drawn to you
even then.</i>

1289
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:53,913
<i>I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back."</i>

1290
01:24:55,689 --> 01:24:58,852
<i>You were in that orange sweatshirt
that I would come to know so well...</i>

1291
01:24:58,925 --> 01:25:00,893
<i>and even hate, eventually.</i>

1292
01:25:00,961 --> 01:25:04,954
At the time I thought,
"How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

1293
01:25:05,031 --> 01:25:07,761
Hi there.

1294
01:25:07,834 --> 01:25:09,768
Hi.

1295
01:25:09,836 --> 01:25:12,771
I saw you sitting over here...

1296
01:25:12,839 --> 01:25:14,773
by yourself,

1297
01:25:14,841 --> 01:25:17,742
and I thought, "Thank God.

1298
01:25:17,811 --> 01:25:20,609
Someone normal
who doesn't know how to interact
at these things either."

1299
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,807
Yeah.

1300
01:25:22,883 --> 01:25:25,909
I don't ever know what to say.

1301
01:25:25,986 --> 01:25:28,716
I'm Clementine.

1302
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:31,952
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1303
01:25:32,025 --> 01:25:34,255
And then you just took it...

1304
01:25:34,327 --> 01:25:36,852
without waiting for an answer.

1305
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,891
It was so intimate,

1306
01:25:42,969 --> 01:25:46,097
like we were already lovers.

1307
01:25:46,173 --> 01:25:48,971
I'm Joel.

1308
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:51,203
Hi, Joel.

1309
01:25:51,278 --> 01:25:54,509
So, no jokes about my name.

1310
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:59,041
You mean like...

1311
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:01,610
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1312
01:26:01,688 --> 01:26:03,713
Yeah. Like that.

1313
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:05,724
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1314
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:09,523
One of my favorite things when I was a kid
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

1315
01:26:09,596 --> 01:26:11,587
<i>Oh.</i>

1316
01:26:13,533 --> 01:26:15,865
I think your name is magical.

1317
01:26:18,772 --> 01:26:21,070
This is it, Joel.

1318
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:23,336
It's gonna be gone soon.

1319
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:27,811
I know.

1320
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:29,815
What do we do?

1321
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:34,710
Enjoy it.

1322
01:26:51,371 --> 01:26:53,669
You married?
No.

1323
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:56,368
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1324
01:26:56,443 --> 01:26:58,343
I do sort of live
with someone though.

1325
01:26:58,411 --> 01:27:01,778
Male or female?
What?

1326
01:27:01,848 --> 01:27:04,282
Female. Female.

1327
01:27:06,419 --> 01:27:09,911
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1328
01:27:12,692 --> 01:27:16,685
You know these people?
No, of course not.
Come on.

1329
01:27:17,697 --> 01:27:19,631
They might have a dog.

1330
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:23,362
There's no dog.

1331
01:27:23,436 --> 01:27:25,427
What are you doing?

1332
01:27:25,505 --> 01:27:28,770
<i>It's freezing out.
I can't believe this.</i>

1333
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:31,811
Hoo-hoo!

1334
01:27:31,878 --> 01:27:35,712
<i>- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo!</i>

1335
01:27:42,455 --> 01:27:45,049
Come on, man.
The water's fine.

1336
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:48,253
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1337
01:27:50,997 --> 01:27:52,931
It's dark.

1338
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:56,992
So, uh, what's
your girlfriend's name?

1339
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:00,301
Naomi, but we're not really...
I mean...

1340
01:28:00,373 --> 01:28:02,773
We're...
Whatever.

1341
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:06,938
<i>So this is great.
Now I can look for, um,
candles, matches...</i>

1342
01:28:07,013 --> 01:28:09,481
<i>and the liquor cabinet.</i>

1343
01:28:09,549 --> 01:28:12,814
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1344
01:28:17,390 --> 01:28:19,255
I think we should go.

1345
01:28:19,326 --> 01:28:21,920
There's no phone line.
What?

1346
01:28:21,995 --> 01:28:24,156
<i>I think we should go.
Why?</i>

1347
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:26,824
It's our house...
just for tonight.

1348
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,869
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1349
01:28:31,004 --> 01:28:33,438
<i>Which one do you want to be?
Uh...</i>

1350
01:28:33,506 --> 01:28:36,998
I prefer to be Ruth,
but I can be flexible.

1351
01:28:38,511 --> 01:28:41,844
What are you do...

1352
01:28:41,915 --> 01:28:44,145
Alcohol!
Oh, boy.

1353
01:28:44,217 --> 01:28:46,811
So, are you okay with wine?

1354
01:28:46,886 --> 01:28:49,548
I don't know.
Well, you choose the wine.

1355
01:28:49,623 --> 01:28:53,855
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more... Ruth.

1356
01:28:57,263 --> 01:29:00,027
<i>I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.</i>

1357
01:29:01,768 --> 01:29:04,896
I've gotta catch my ride.

1358
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:09,231
<i>So go.</i>

1359
01:29:09,309 --> 01:29:11,402
I did.

1360
01:29:11,478 --> 01:29:14,345
<i>I thought maybe you were a nut,</i>

1361
01:29:14,414 --> 01:29:17,212
<i>but you were exciting.</i>

1362
01:29:18,318 --> 01:29:20,252
<i>I wish you'd stayed.</i>

1363
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,016
I wish I'd stayed too.
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1364
01:29:23,089 --> 01:29:26,149
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1365
01:29:26,226 --> 01:29:28,558
Oh, God, I wish I had...

1366
01:29:32,532 --> 01:29:35,660
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1367
01:29:35,735 --> 01:29:40,297
<i>Well, I came back downstairs,
and you were gone.
I walked out. I walked out the door.</i>

1368
01:29:40,373 --> 01:29:43,206
<i>Why?
I don't know.
I felt like a scared little kid.</i>

1369
01:29:43,276 --> 01:29:46,609
I was like...
It was above my head.
I don't know.

1370
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,614
<i>You were scared?</i>

1371
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:50,616
Yeah.

1372
01:29:51,651 --> 01:29:54,279
Thought you knew that
about me.

1373
01:29:54,354 --> 01:29:58,347
<i>I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.</i>

1374
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:02,054
<i>Was it something I said?
Yeah.</i>

1375
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:07,231
You said, "So go"...

1376
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,768
with such disdain, you know?

1377
01:30:09,836 --> 01:30:12,464
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.
It's okay.</i>

1378
01:30:18,044 --> 01:30:19,978
<i>Joely?</i>

1379
01:30:20,046 --> 01:30:22,913
What if you stayed this time?

1380
01:30:25,585 --> 01:30:28,213
I walked out the door.

1381
01:30:28,288 --> 01:30:30,222
There's no memory left.

1382
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:33,418
Come back and make up
a good-bye, at least.

1383
01:30:33,493 --> 01:30:35,427
Let's pretend we had one.

1384
01:30:46,539 --> 01:30:49,030
Bye, Joel.

1385
01:30:49,109 --> 01:30:51,043
I love you.

1386
01:30:51,111 --> 01:30:55,377
Meet me in Montauk.

1387
01:30:59,052 --> 01:31:03,250
<i>I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.</i>

1388
01:31:03,323 --> 01:31:07,419
<i>You were operating the plane
with the remote control,
and then it crashed.</i>

1389
01:31:07,494 --> 01:31:09,826
<i>It was fucking windy.
Come on, man.</i>

1390
01:31:09,896 --> 01:31:11,864
<i>You're stoned, and you're driving.</i>

1391
01:31:11,931 --> 01:31:14,491
<i>Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.</i>

1392
01:31:14,567 --> 01:31:17,092
<i>That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking,
then I'll smoke it.</i>

1393
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:20,799
<i>It does.
That's a medical fact.</i>

1394
01:31:20,874 --> 01:31:23,308
<i>It was proven
on the Science Network.</i>

1395
01:31:23,376 --> 01:31:25,810
<i>Honey, just watch the road.
I can't see shit.</i>

1396
01:31:28,381 --> 01:31:31,373
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

1397
01:31:31,451 --> 01:31:34,284
<i>She was nice.
Yeah, man. Who was that?</i>

1398
01:31:36,389 --> 01:31:39,688
She was, um, just a girl.

1399
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:50,067
Okay.

1400
01:32:25,572 --> 01:32:28,336
So I gotta...
I gotta drop the van off.

1401
01:32:28,408 --> 01:32:30,501
<i>Thanks, Stan. Thanks.</i>

1402
01:32:30,577 --> 01:32:33,910
We'll talk.

1403
01:33:51,925 --> 01:33:53,916
Hey!

1404
01:33:54,994 --> 01:33:56,928
Hey.

1405
01:33:58,398 --> 01:34:01,128
You got a lot
of your stuff there, I see.
Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1406
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:04,636
<i>I take it you're not coming back.
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.</i>

1407
01:34:04,704 --> 01:34:08,435
Do you swear you didn't know?
I-I swear.

1408
01:34:08,508 --> 01:34:12,103
So you didn't do the erasing?
Of course not. God, no.

1409
01:34:12,178 --> 01:34:14,373
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1410
01:34:14,447 --> 01:34:18,679
Once, maybe.

1411
01:34:18,751 --> 01:34:21,743
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

1412
01:34:21,821 --> 01:34:24,415
I saw you two talking.

1413
01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:28,221
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, you know.

1414
01:34:28,294 --> 01:34:30,592
How'd I look?

1415
01:34:32,031 --> 01:34:33,965
You looked happy.

1416
01:34:34,033 --> 01:34:36,297
Happy with a secret.

1417
01:34:37,704 --> 01:34:39,638
And after that?

1418
01:34:39,706 --> 01:34:42,869
I never saw you two together
again like that, so I just...

1419
01:34:42,942 --> 01:34:46,639
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

1420
01:35:05,565 --> 01:35:08,591
<i>Aah!
Montauk train
now boarding on track "B." All aboard.</i>

1421
01:35:11,437 --> 01:35:13,928
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1422
01:35:15,108 --> 01:35:17,406
You know that?

1423
01:35:27,453 --> 01:35:29,421
Thanks.

1424
01:36:03,056 --> 01:36:05,149
Let me get my toothbrush.

1425
01:36:05,224 --> 01:36:07,692
Yeah. Just...

1426
01:36:20,306 --> 01:36:22,866
<i>Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.</i>

1427
01:36:22,942 --> 01:36:27,311
<i>La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me,
and I don't know what I did.</i>

1428
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:30,144
<i>What did I do?</i>

1429
01:36:30,216 --> 01:36:32,684
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1430
01:36:32,752 --> 01:36:34,743
<i>I'll do anything
to make you happy.</i>

1431
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:37,085
<i>Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.</i>

1432
01:36:37,156 --> 01:36:40,922
<i>Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.</i>

1433
01:36:40,993 --> 01:36:42,927
Oh. Whew.

1434
01:36:53,739 --> 01:36:56,936
<i>Vmonos, seor.</i>

1435
01:36:57,009 --> 01:37:00,172
I-I had a really nice time
last night.

1436
01:37:00,246 --> 01:37:02,874
Nice?

1437
01:37:02,949 --> 01:37:06,180
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life...

1438
01:37:06,252 --> 01:37:08,186
last night.

1439
01:37:08,254 --> 01:37:10,245
That's better.

1440
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:17,557
<i>This is weird.
To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.</i>

1441
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:21,122
<i>My name is Mary Svevo.
"We've met,
but you don't remember me.</i>

1442
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:25,637
I worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased."

1443
01:37:25,705 --> 01:37:28,230
<i>I have since decided
that this is a horrible...
Some kind of teaser ad or something.</i>

1444
01:37:28,307 --> 01:37:32,869
<i>In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.</i>

1445
01:37:32,945 --> 01:37:36,540
<i>My name is Clementine Kruczynski.</i>

1446
01:37:36,616 --> 01:37:39,346
<i>I'm here to erase Joel Barish.</i>

1447
01:37:39,418 --> 01:37:41,648
What is this?
I don't know.

1448
01:37:41,721 --> 01:37:46,317
<i>He's boring.
Is that enough reason
to erase someone?</i>

1449
01:37:46,392 --> 01:37:50,089
<i>I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now,</i>

1450
01:37:50,163 --> 01:37:52,097
<i>and it's like he changed me.</i>

1451
01:37:52,165 --> 01:37:55,931
<i>I feel like I'm always pissy now.
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.</i>

1452
01:37:56,002 --> 01:38:00,598
<i>I can't stand to even look at him.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.</i>

1453
01:38:00,673 --> 01:38:03,870
<i>- That sort of wounded puppy shit
he does, you know?
- What are you doing?</i>

1454
01:38:03,943 --> 01:38:06,377
<i>I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly
fucking off the rose at this point.</i>

1455
01:38:06,445 --> 01:38:09,437
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

1456
01:38:09,515 --> 01:38:11,949
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I'm not!

1457
01:38:12,018 --> 01:38:16,387
- You clearly are.
- Look, let's just take a minute and...

1458
01:38:45,051 --> 01:38:46,985
Patrick, get the fuck away.

1459
01:38:47,053 --> 01:38:49,453
Oh, sweetheart...
Get the fuck away from me!

1460
01:38:49,522 --> 01:38:52,753
Can we talk about it?
No! Get the fuck away!

1461
01:39:25,024 --> 01:39:27,288
Joel Barish.

1462
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,124
<i>Hey, Clementine.
Hey.</i>

1463
01:39:30,196 --> 01:39:33,427
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1464
01:39:34,433 --> 01:39:36,367
Yeah.

1465
01:39:36,435 --> 01:39:38,426
<i>Really very educated.</i>

1466
01:39:38,504 --> 01:39:41,940
<i>I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.</i>

1467
01:39:42,008 --> 01:39:44,909
<i>I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?</i>

1468
01:39:44,977 --> 01:39:48,413
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

1469
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:51,882
<i>Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.</i>

1470
01:39:51,951 --> 01:39:54,613
<i>Sometimes...
I was embarrassed in public...</i>

1471
01:39:54,687 --> 01:39:56,678
<i>Hi.
because she would pronounce...</i>

1472
01:39:56,756 --> 01:39:59,520
<i>library "libary."
Hi.</i>

1473
01:39:59,592 --> 01:40:02,720
<i>Libary. Libary.</i>

1474
01:40:02,795 --> 01:40:04,729
Look what I found.

1475
01:40:04,797 --> 01:40:09,131
<i>I think if there's
a truly seductive quality
about Clementine,</i>

1476
01:40:09,201 --> 01:40:12,864
<i>it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.</i>

1477
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,572
<i>You made me look skinny.</i>

1478
01:40:16,642 --> 01:40:19,202
<i>Amazing, burning meteorite...</i>

1479
01:40:19,278 --> 01:40:23,578
<i>will carry you to another world
where things are exciting.</i>

1480
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:26,675
<i>But what you quickly learn
is that...</i>

1481
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:29,585
<i>it's really an elaborate ruse.</i>

1482
01:40:29,655 --> 01:40:31,646
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1483
01:40:33,259 --> 01:40:35,989
<i>It's okay.
So flashy
in a kind of obvious way.</i>

1484
01:40:37,697 --> 01:40:40,257
<i>But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.</i>

1485
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:42,563
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1486
01:40:42,635 --> 01:40:47,095
<i>- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it's... it's only fair.</i>

1487
01:40:48,441 --> 01:40:50,409
<i>Where's the real Clementine?</i>

1488
01:40:50,476 --> 01:40:53,604
<i>I mean, the whole thing with the hair...
it's all bullshit.</i>

1489
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:56,409
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1490
01:40:56,482 --> 01:40:58,712
<i>I really like your hair.
Thank you.</i>

1491
01:40:58,784 --> 01:41:00,718
<i>I do.
The world's a goddamn mess.</i>

1492
01:41:00,786 --> 01:41:04,415
<i>Is it some kind of a revolt?
Change your hair color.
You want a drink or something?</i>

1493
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:07,220
Do you have any whiskey?

1494
01:41:07,293 --> 01:41:12,595
<i>No, I don't think her sex
is... motivated.</i>

1495
01:41:12,665 --> 01:41:15,657
<i>I saw it clearly
the last night we were together.</i>

1496
01:41:15,735 --> 01:41:19,136
<i>It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.</i>

1497
01:41:19,205 --> 01:41:22,265
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1498
01:41:22,341 --> 01:41:26,004
<i>The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her...</i>

1499
01:41:26,078 --> 01:41:28,911
<i>is to fuck 'em...</i>

1500
01:41:28,981 --> 01:41:33,213
<i>or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of 'em.</i>

1501
01:41:33,285 --> 01:41:36,220
<i>And she's so desperate
and insecure...</i>

1502
01:41:36,288 --> 01:41:41,123
<i>that she'll, sooner or later,
go around fucking everybody.</i>

1503
01:41:41,193 --> 01:41:44,219
<i>I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that
about you.</i>

1504
01:41:44,296 --> 01:41:47,197
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1505
01:41:47,266 --> 01:41:50,497
<i>Because it really hurts me
that you said that
because I don't do that.</i>

1506
01:41:50,569 --> 01:41:53,663
<i>I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'm gonna... go.</i>

1507
01:41:53,739 --> 01:41:58,540
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think I can be here.

1508
01:42:02,681 --> 01:42:06,344
Um... bye.

1509
01:42:06,419 --> 01:42:09,047
<i>Bye.
I thought I knew her so well.</i>

1510
01:42:09,121 --> 01:42:12,716
<i>It was nice meeting you and all.
But I don't know her at all.</i>

1511
01:42:14,026 --> 01:42:17,393
<i>What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,</i>

1512
01:42:17,463 --> 01:42:21,365
<i>only to find out
that she's a stranger.</i>

1513
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:26,661
Wait.

1514
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:30,274
<i>What?
I don't know.</i>

1515
01:42:30,342 --> 01:42:32,503
<i>Just wait. Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?</i>

1516
01:42:32,578 --> 01:42:37,106
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...
just a while.

1517
01:42:50,663 --> 01:42:53,359
<i>Okay.
Really?</i>

1518
01:42:53,432 --> 01:42:57,562
<i>I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking
for my own peace of mind.</i>

1519
01:42:57,636 --> 01:43:01,572
- I'm not perfect.
- I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1520
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:04,336
Right now I can't.
But you will.
But you will.

1521
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:08,039
You know, you will think of things,
and I'll get bored with you
and feel trapped...

1522
01:43:08,113 --> 01:43:10,172
because that's what happens
with me.

1523
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,584
