1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The Western and Atlantic Flyer 
speeding into Marietta, Ga., in 
Spring of 1861.

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,000
There were two loves in his life.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000

His engine,

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
And ---

5
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,500
'Fort Sumter has been fired upon.'

6
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,000
'Then the war is here.'

7
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,500
'Yes, dad, and I'm going to be 
one of the first to enlist.'

8
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
'Aren't you going to enlist?'

9
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,750  
'Your name?'

10
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,900
'Occupation?'

11
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,000
'Engineer on the Western and 
Atlantic Railroad.'

12
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,750
'Don't enlist him. He is more 
valuable to the South as an engineer.'

13
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,500
'We can't use you.'

14
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
'Occupation?'

15
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
'Bartender.'

16
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
'If you lose this war
don't blame me.'

17
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,250
'Did Johnnie enlist?'

18
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,500
'He didn't even get in line.'

19
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,250
'He's a disgrace to the South.'

20
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
'Why didn't you enlist?'

21
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,250
'They wouldn't take me.'

22
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:17,000
'Please don't lie -- I don't want
you to speak to me again until
you are in uniform.'

23
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:51,250
A year later. In a Union encampment 
just North of Chattanooga.

24
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
General Thatcher, and his chief
spy, Captain Anderson.

25
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:16,750
'I know every foot of this railroad
from Marietta to Chattanooga -- and
with ten picked men I cannot fail.'

26
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:30,750
'We will enter the South as civilians coming 
from the neutral state of Kentucky to
join the Southern cause.' 

27
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:42,750
'At Big Shanty we will steal the 
train while the passengers and 
crew are at dinner, and proceeding '...


28
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,750
...' North we will burn every bridge, 
cutting off the supplies of the
army now facing you.'


28
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:10,750
'Then the day you steal the train
I will have General Parker
advance to meet you.' 

29
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,750
'As soon as I arrive I will let
you know how seriously father
is wounded.'

30
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,750
'Big Shanty. Twenty minutes 
for dinner.'

31
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
'Three men stole my General.
I think they are deserters.'

32
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,000
'Why not stop and fight them?'

33
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,250
'I'm afraid they have us 
greatly outnumbered.'

34
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The Southern army facing 
Chattanooga is ordered to 
retreat.

34
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
General Parker's victorious 
Nothern army advancing.

35
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
'There is only one man on that engine.'
 
36
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
In the enemy's country --
hopelessly lost, helplessly 
cold and horribly hungry.

37
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,000
'At nine o'clock tomorrow
morning our supply trains will
meet and unite with General '... 


37
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,000
...' Parker's army at the Rock River
bridge.'

38
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:25,834
'Then the army, backed by our supply 
trains, will advance for a surprise 
attack on the rebel's left flank.'

39
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
'Once our trains and troops cross
that bridge, nothing on earth can
stop us.'

40
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:26,750
'This girl was in the baggage 
car when we stole the train, so 
I thought it best to hold her.'

41
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,000
'We had better stay here until 
daybreak to see where we are.'

42
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,000
'It was so brave of you to risk
your life, coming into the enemy's
country, just to save me.'

43
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
After a nice, quiet, refreshing 
night's rest.

44
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,000
'We've got to get back to our
lines somehow and warn them of 
this coming attack.'

45
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:07,750
'I will get that spy BEFORE he reaches 
the Southern lines. You follow 
with the supply trains as planned.'

46
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
'We must pick up more firewood.'

47
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
The Rock River bridge

48
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
The Northern division nearing 
the bridge to meet the supply trains

49
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:05,000
'That bridge is not burned enough
to stop you, and my men will 
ford the river.'

50
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Heroes of the day.

51
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
'Is that your uniform?'

52
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
'I had to wear it to get 
through the lines.'

53
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
'Take it off!'

54
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
'Enlist the Lieutenant.'

55
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,250
'Occupation?'

56
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
'Soldier.'
