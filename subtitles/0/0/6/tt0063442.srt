1
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,287
And that completes my final report
until we reach touchdown.

2
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:26,038
We're now on full automatic,
in the hands of the computers.

3
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:28,857
I've tucked my crew in for the long sleep

4
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,929
and I'll be joining them

5
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:33,009
soon.

6
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:37,305
In less than an hour we'll finish
our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.

7
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:40,120
Six months in deep space.

8
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,194
By our time, that is.

9
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,311
According to Dr. Hasslein's theory of time in a
vehicle traveling nearly the speed of light,

10
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:52,372
the Earth has aged
nearly 700 years since we left it,

11
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:54,450
while we've aged hardly at all.

12
00:00:57,242 --> 00:00:59,250
It may be so.

13
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:01,298
This much is probably true.

14
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:05,462
The men who sent us on this journey
are long since dead and gone.

15
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:09,328
You who are reading me now
are a different breed.

16
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:11,856
I hope a better one.

17
00:01:11,963 --> 00:01:15,411
I leave the 20th century with no regrets, but...

18
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:17,044
one more thing.

19
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:19,219
If anybody's listening, that is.

20
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:22,707
Nothing scientific. It's... purely personal.

21
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:26,195
Seen from out here,

22
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,106
everything seems different.

23
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,220
Time bends.

24
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,877
Space is... boundless.

25
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:36,534
It squashes a man's ego.

26
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,568
I feel lonely.

27
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,067
That's about it.

28
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:54,004
Tell me, though...

29
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,497
Does man, that marvel of the universe,

30
00:01:57,565 --> 00:02:01,176
that glorious paradox
who has sent me to the stars,

31
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,862
still make war against his brother,

32
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:08,092
keep his neighbor's children starving?

33
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:58,937
Are you all right?

34
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:07,802
Stewart?

35
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,194
Stewart?

36
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,769
We're in the soup!

37
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:35,290
She's sinking! Dodge, read the atmosphere!

38
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:52,249
Landon, get out a last signal!

39
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,396
What signal?

40
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,468
To Earth! That we've landed!

41
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:39,138
The air's OK!

42
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:42,882
Blow the hatch before we lose all our power!

43
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,187
It's no use! The power's gone!

44
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,108
Forget it! Abandon ship!

45
00:10:36,295 --> 00:10:38,149
She's sinking.

46
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:42,753
Going...

47
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:47,041
Going...

48
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:51,266
Gone.

49
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,213
OK. We're here to stay.

50
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:12,446
Well, where are we?

51
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:14,526
Do you have any notion, skipper?

52
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,566
We're some 320 light years from Earth

53
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,562
on an unnamed planet in orbit
around a star in the constellation of Orion.

54
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,671
Is that close enough for you?

55
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:28,257
That could be Bellatrix.

56
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:30,564
It's too white for Bellatrix.

57
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:33,566
You didn't have time to read the tapes.

58
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:36,258
So you really don't know, do you?

59
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,334
What went wrong?

60
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,058
We weren't programmed to land in the water.

61
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,957
The question is not so much
where we are as when we are.

62
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:48,447
We've had enough sleep
to hold us for a while.

63
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,008
Let's start earning all that back pay.

64
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,632
Dodge, run your soil test.

65
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:34,526
- Got your sensors?
- Right.

66
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:36,641
- Geiger counter?
- Got it.

67
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:41,700
Let's see. One pistol,

68
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:46,623
20 rounds ammo, a medical kit, camera, TX9.

69
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:50,724
We've got food and water
enough for three days.

70
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:52,800
How long is a day?

71
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:54,913
That's a good question.

72
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:56,392
Landon!

73
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,367
Hey, Landon!

74
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,449
Join the expedition.

75
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:06,886
Sorry. I was thinking about Stewart.
What do you suppose happened?

76
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,960
Air leak. She died in her sleep.

77
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:11,238
You don't seem very cut up about it.

78
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:14,722
It's a little late for a wake.
She's been dead nearly a year.

79
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:18,274
That means we've been away
from Earth for 18 months.

80
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:20,320
Our time.

81
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:23,490
You've gone gray.

82
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:29,639
Apart from that you look pretty chipper
for a man who's 2,031 years old.

83
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:33,351
I read the clocks.
They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.

84
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:36,898
We have been away from Earth
for 2,000 years,

85
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:38,944
give or take a decade.

86
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,699
Still can't accept it?

87
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:44,967
Time's wiped out everything you ever knew.

88
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:47,010
It's all dust.

89
00:13:47,116 --> 00:13:49,089
Prove it.

90
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,878
If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.

91
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:55,624
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.

92
00:13:56,427 --> 00:14:00,388
Nothing will grow here.
There's just a trace of carbohydrates.

93
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,307
All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates.

94
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:05,377
No dangerous ionization?

95
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:07,459
No.

96
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,255
Well...

97
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:13,512
If there's no life here,
we've got just 72 hours to find it.

98
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,491
That's when the groceries run out. Let's go.

99
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,563
Which direction?

100
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:21,634
That way.

101
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,812
Any particular reason?

102
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:25,891
None at all.

103
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,755
Come on...

104
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,399
Everybody all right?

105
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,533
Water check.

106
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:26,953
Eight ounces.

107
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:35,783
It doesn't add up.

108
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:37,994
Thunder and lightning, and no rain.

109
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:40,102
Cloud cover at night.

110
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,990
That strange luminosity...
yet there's no moon.

111
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:45,062
If we could just get a fix.

112
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:48,997
What would that tell you?
I've told you where you are and when you are.

113
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:51,045
All right, all right.

114
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,697
You're 300 light years
from your precious planet.

115
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,695
Your loved ones are dead
and forgotten for 20 centuries.

116
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:03,688
20! Even if you could get back, they'd think
you were something that fell out of a tree.

117
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,701
Taylor, quit riding him.

118
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:08,623
There is just one reality.
We are here and it is now.

119
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,407
You get hold of that,
or you might as well be dead.

120
00:18:11,505 --> 00:18:14,024
I'm prepared to die.

121
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:18,598
He's prepared to die.

122
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:20,778
Doesn't that make you misty?

123
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,782
Chalk up another victory for the human spirit.

124
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:35,468
Clue me in on something, will you?
Why did you sign on for this trip?

125
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:37,510
You volunteered. Why?

126
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,623
Never mind. I'll clue you in.

127
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:42,892
You were the golden boy of the class of '72.

128
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:46,506
When they nominated you for the big one,
you couldn't turn it down.

129
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:49,326
Not without losing your all-American image.

130
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:51,215
Climb off, will you?

131
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:53,900
Oh, and the glory. Don't forget that.

132
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:58,223
There's a life-size bronze statue of you
standing out there somewhere.

133
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:02,031
It's probably turned green by now
and nobody can read the nameplate.

134
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:04,748
But never let it be said
that we forget our heroes.

135
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,711
- Taylor, I'm telling you to climb off my back.
- And there's one last item.

136
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:12,080
Immortality.
You wanted to live for ever, didn't you?

137
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,184
Well, you damn near made it.

138
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:18,664
Except for me and Dodge,
you've lived longer than anyone ever born.

139
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:25,196
And with our lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead,
it looks like you're the last of the line.

140
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,516
You got what you wanted, tiger.
How does it taste?

141
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,875
OK. You read me well enough.

142
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:34,920
But why can't I read you?

143
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,000
Don't bother.

144
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:39,441
Dodge, there. He's not like me at all.

145
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:41,992
But he makes sense.

146
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,465
He'd walk naked into a live volcano

147
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,491
if he thought he could learn something
that no other man knew.

148
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,952
But you... You're no seeker.

149
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:53,033
You're negative.

150
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:57,164
- And I'm not prepared to die.
- I'd like to know why not.

151
00:19:57,267 --> 00:20:01,325
You thought life on Earth was meaningless.
You despised people.

152
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:03,402
So what did you do? You ran out.

153
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,842
No, no. It's not like that, Landon.

154
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm a seeker too.

155
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:13,522
But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help
thinking somewhere in the universe

156
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:16,967
there has to be something
better than man. Has to be.

157
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:21,162
Taylor, over here!

158
00:20:58,612 --> 00:20:59,921
Life.

159
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:16,497
Where there's one, there's another.

160
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:18,986
And another and another.

161
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:21,065
Let's find 'em.

162
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,374
Skipper!

163
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:54,574
Look!

164
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,406
Scarecrows?

165
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:14,351
Let's see.

166
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:00,174
To hell with the scarecrows!

167
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,171
Taylor!

168
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,248
Look at this.

169
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:48,985
Taylor, look!

170
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,213
They didn't leave much, did they?

171
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,932
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.

172
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,064
Blessed are the vegetarians.

173
00:29:12,158 --> 00:29:14,840
They look more or less human,

174
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,883
but I think they're mute.

175
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:28,502
We got off at the wrong stop.

176
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:34,333
You're supposed to be the optimist, Landon.
Look on the bright side.

177
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:39,830
If this is the best they've got around here,
in six months we'll be running this planet.

178
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:30,907
Smile.

179
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:11,904
Which one was wearing
the strange clothes?

180
00:35:12,934 --> 00:35:14,908
This one.

181
00:35:16,518 --> 00:35:18,524
Will he live?

182
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:20,898
I don't know.

183
00:35:21,029 --> 00:35:23,330
This beast has lost a lot of blood.

184
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:32,069
There's no probe here. Find one!

185
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:34,140
Yes, sir.

186
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:36,220
This place is dirty, doctor.

187
00:35:36,294 --> 00:35:41,629
Doctor, these animals are dirty. They stink
and they carry communicable diseases.

188
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:44,930
Why aren't they cleaned up
before they're brought here?

189
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:49,917
- You don't sound happy in your work.
- I'm little more than a vet in this laboratory.

190
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,891
You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius about me.

191
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:56,446
I did. You know how
he looks down his nose at chimpanzees.

192
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:59,004
But the quota system's been abolished.

193
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,307
- You made it. Why can't I?
- What do you mean - made it?

194
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:05,952
I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.
We have no authority.

195
00:36:06,022 --> 00:36:09,283
You do all right when it comes to
getting space and equipment.

196
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:12,896
That's because Dr. Zaius
realizes our work has value.

197
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:17,571
The foundations of scientific brain surgery
are being laid right here

198
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:20,420
in studies of cerebral functions
of these animals.

199
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:24,035
They're still dirty, doctor.

200
00:36:24,102 --> 00:36:26,949
And their bite is septic. There. Look at that.

201
00:36:28,328 --> 00:36:30,335
Hold his jaw.

202
00:36:54,536 --> 00:36:57,022
- Good morning, Dr. Zira.
- Good morning, Julius.

203
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:59,485
- How's our patient today?
- No change.

204
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,112
The minute you open the door,
he goes into his act.

205
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:06,464
Well!

206
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:08,575
And what do we want this morning?

207
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:11,135
Do we want something? Come on. Speak.

208
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,645
Come on.

209
00:37:12,744 --> 00:37:13,954
Speak.

210
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,325
Do we want some sugar, old-timer?

211
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:21,029
You could get hurt doing that, doctor.

212
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:23,397
Oh, don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.

213
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:26,398
They're all tame
until they take a chunk out of you.

214
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:29,732
Well, Bright Eyes. Is our throat feeling better?

215
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:32,736
Still hurts, doesn't it?

216
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:35,710
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.

217
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,633
That Bright Eyes is remarkable.

218
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:44,125
He keeps trying to form words.

219
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:46,850
You know what they say.
Human see, human do.

220
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,447
Now what?

221
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,982
He seems to want something.

222
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:01,568
I'd be careful, doctor.

223
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:02,850
What did I tell you?

224
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,375
Try that again and I'll break your arm!

225
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:10,052
Good morning, Your Excellency.

226
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:12,127
Dr. Zaius.

227
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,839
Good morning, sir.

228
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,431
Open up, please.

229
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,513
I'm so glad you could come.

230
00:38:20,618 --> 00:38:22,625
Sir, he's over here.

231
00:38:24,873 --> 00:38:26,880
Bright Eyes...

232
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:29,536
Show him. Go ahead.

233
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:31,583
Do your trick.

234
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:33,063
Speak.

235
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,138
Go on. Speak again.

236
00:38:37,545 --> 00:38:40,578
There! Can you believe it?

237
00:38:40,682 --> 00:38:42,689
Yes, amusing.

238
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:44,768
A man acting like an ape.

239
00:38:46,953 --> 00:38:50,947
Dr. Zaius, I could swear he's answering you.

240
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,767
He has a definite gift for mimicry.

241
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:56,104
Most unusual.

242
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:58,657
He's using that old blanket as clothing.

243
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:03,808
I wonder how he'd score
on a Hopkins manual dexterity test.

244
00:39:03,914 --> 00:39:06,052
An animal?

245
00:39:06,122 --> 00:39:07,105
Look!

246
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,184
He's moving his fingers.

247
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,624
Only because he saw you moving yours.

248
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,472
But perhaps he understood.

249
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:17,767
Man has no understanding.

250
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:20,834
He can be taught a few simple tricks.
Nothing more.

251
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:24,554
I'm afraid I must disagree.

252
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:28,807
- According to my experiments...
- Dr. Zira, I must caution you.

253
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:32,932
Experimental brain surgery
on these creatures is one thing,

254
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,010
and I'm all in favor of it.

255
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:39,109
But your behavioral studies
are something else again.

256
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:43,935
To suggest that we can learn anything
about the simian nature

257
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:46,464
from the study of man is sheer nonsense.

258
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:49,603
Besides, man is a nuisance.

259
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:53,056
He eats up his food supplies in the forest,

260
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,408
then migrates to our green belts
and ravages our crops.

261
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:03,109
The sooner he is exterminated the better.

262
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:07,016
It's a question of simian survival.

263
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:21,092
Is this the one you wanted, doctor?

264
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:24,228
Oh, yes. Thank you.

265
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:27,714
Bright Eyes, I've got a present for you.

266
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,561
Put her in with him.

267
00:41:31,054 --> 00:41:33,027
Cornelius! Up here.

268
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:36,452
Do you have to work tonight?

269
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:37,734
No.

270
00:41:37,806 --> 00:41:39,813
Neither do I.

271
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:46,245
Oh, Cornelius.

272
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:03,269
There's Bright Eyes.

273
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,020
The one I was telling you about.

274
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:08,711
What's so special about him?

275
00:42:08,814 --> 00:42:10,243
Watch.

276
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,724
Hello, Bright Eyes.

277
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,797
How's our throat today?

278
00:42:18,638 --> 00:42:21,485
- Look! She remembers!
- Remembers what?

279
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:23,589
The blood transfusion.

280
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:24,971
Zira, really!

281
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:27,078
You know, they can't... Watch out.

282
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,906
Here comes number one.

283
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:34,091
Something's bothering him. He's been
prying around the lab for the last two days.

284
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:36,165
Good morning, Dr. Zaius.

285
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:40,133
- You know my... Dr. Cornelius, my fianc?
- Of course.

286
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:45,029
The young ape with a shovel. I hear you're
planning another archaeological expedition.

287
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:49,160
- With the Academy's approval, sir.
- The project will require my support.

288
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:51,238
I hope I may count on it, sir.

289
00:42:51,343 --> 00:42:53,863
Cornelius, a friendly warning.

290
00:42:53,967 --> 00:42:58,724
As you dig for artifacts,
be sure you don't bury your reputation.

291
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,834
Guard!

292
00:43:13,935 --> 00:43:15,364
Guard!

293
00:43:37,008 --> 00:43:38,382
Stop!

294
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,716
You'll hurt him!

295
00:43:40,816 --> 00:43:42,790
Take him inside.

296
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,388
Cornelius! Cornelius,
if you have a moment today,

297
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:52,358
I'd like to discuss
this expedition of yours in more detail.

298
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:56,326
Certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes
and I'll come right over.

299
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,433
I don't understand
these animal psychologists.

300
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,806
What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?

301
00:44:01,904 --> 00:44:04,838
That man can be domesticated.

302
00:44:41,905 --> 00:44:45,166
- What happened?
- Oh, those fools and their torches.

303
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:47,600
- Do you have any ointment?
- I'll see.

304
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:54,537
I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

305
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:01,093
Julius!

306
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:06,024
I told you what you'd get!

307
00:45:06,097 --> 00:45:07,438
Julius, don't, don't, don't!

308
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:09,130
It doesn't matter!

309
00:45:09,202 --> 00:45:11,209
Julius, don't hurt him!

310
00:45:13,906 --> 00:45:14,985
Julius!

311
00:45:20,882 --> 00:45:23,150
Natural-born thieves, aren't they?

312
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:38,411
Get me a collar and leash.

313
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:41,898
- I'm taking him out of here.
- He's vicious, doctor.

314
00:45:42,004 --> 00:45:44,907
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- Do as I say!

315
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:59,952
You... you wouldn't hurt me, would you,

316
00:46:02,165 --> 00:46:03,147
Taylor?

317
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:21,548
It's a stunt.

318
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,661
Humans can't write.

319
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:25,741
Dear, you're a scientist.

320
00:46:25,813 --> 00:46:27,787
Don't you believe your own eyes?

321
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:34,195
Where did you learn to do this?

322
00:46:37,271 --> 00:46:39,059
"Jefferson

323
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:41,973
Public School."

324
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,645
"Fort Wayne,

325
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:51,724
Indiana."

326
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:57,069
Back on that planet you say you came from?

327
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:05,325
Maybe he is intelligent.

328
00:47:05,399 --> 00:47:07,886
But he is also... crazy.

329
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,779
Cornelius.

330
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:11,854
Cornelius, please.

331
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,027
"Dodge was killed in the hunt."

332
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,225
"What happened to... Landon?"

333
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:26,347
I don't know.

334
00:47:26,455 --> 00:47:29,138
They fell out of the sky with you?

335
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:35,344
"Not fell. Flew."

336
00:47:35,447 --> 00:47:37,868
Flight is a scientific impossibility.

337
00:47:37,975 --> 00:47:41,041
And even if it weren't, why fly?

338
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,118
Where would it get you?

339
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,229
"Do you have maps?"

340
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:18,190
We're here. You were captured here.

341
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,607
You fell into the water here?

342
00:48:23,481 --> 00:48:25,488
You came ashore...

343
00:48:25,593 --> 00:48:27,567
Marched across the desert?

344
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,478
Mountains?

345
00:48:31,256 --> 00:48:33,263
Many days and nights.

346
00:48:33,336 --> 00:48:35,823
And reached the jungle.

347
00:48:35,928 --> 00:48:38,317
Out of the question.

348
00:48:40,154 --> 00:48:43,251
Cornelius, why do you insist
on provoking him?

349
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:48,590
No creature can survive in the forbidden
zone. I know. I've been there. I've seen it.

350
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:53,038
"Then how do you account for me?"

351
00:48:53,784 --> 00:48:55,759
I don't.

352
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,840
And I'm not going to try.

353
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:02,743
But what about your theory?

354
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:06,903
The existence of someone
like Taylor might prove it.

355
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:09,172
Do you want to get my head chopped off?

356
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:12,886
Don't be foolish.
If it's true, they'll have to accept it.

357
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:14,959
No, they won't.

358
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:18,997
Cornelius has developed
the most brilliant hypothesis.

359
00:49:19,065 --> 00:49:21,072
But I'm probably wrong.

360
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:24,527
That the ape evolved from
a lower order of primate,

361
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:26,673
possibly man.

362
00:49:26,745 --> 00:49:29,112
In his trip to the forbidden zone,

363
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:33,235
he discovered traces
of a culture older than recorded time.

364
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:36,915
- The evidence was very meager.
- You didn't think so then.

365
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:41,141
That was before Dr. Zaius and half
of the Academy said my idea was heresy.

366
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:43,698
How can scientific truth be heresy?

367
00:49:43,771 --> 00:49:47,186
What if Taylor is exactly
the proof you needed?

368
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:49,265
A mutation.

369
00:49:49,337 --> 00:49:53,166
A missing link between
the unevolved primate

370
00:49:53,242 --> 00:49:54,867
and the ape.

371
00:49:56,314 --> 00:49:58,681
Touchy, isn't he?

372
00:50:00,058 --> 00:50:02,032
"I am not a missing link."

373
00:50:02,138 --> 00:50:06,993
Well, if he were a missing link, the sacred
scrolls wouldn't be worth their parchment.

374
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:09,650
Well, maybe they're not.

375
00:50:09,722 --> 00:50:13,748
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not going to get into that battle.

376
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:17,495
- Cornelius, show some strength!
- Zira, listen to me!

377
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,864
Now, we both have fine futures.

378
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:22,002
Marriage, stimulating careers.

379
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:24,080
I'm up for a raise.

380
00:50:25,243 --> 00:50:26,933
Dr. Zaius.

381
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:31,065
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?

382
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:33,618
No, sir. I was just collecting my notes.

383
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:37,881
You know Dr. Maximus, of course.
Our commissioner for animal affairs.

384
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:40,565
Yes, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.

385
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,641
What is that?

386
00:50:42,714 --> 00:50:44,753
A man, Dr. Maximus.

387
00:50:44,826 --> 00:50:48,209
I know it's a man. And you know the rules.

388
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:53,139
No animals allowed outside the compound,
and most especially not without a leash.

389
00:50:53,244 --> 00:50:55,217
Yes, sir, but... but this

390
00:50:55,355 --> 00:50:58,104
creature is a special case.

391
00:50:58,235 --> 00:51:00,438
Why special?

392
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:02,743
We're conducting a new experiment.

393
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:06,072
Wouldn't that more properly be done
in your office?

394
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:07,665
Yes, sir.

395
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:10,869
Guards, return this beast to the compound.

396
00:51:11,899 --> 00:51:13,273
What is this?

397
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:18,226
A toy.

398
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:20,337
It floats on the air.

399
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:22,005
Zira...

400
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:23,352
Try it.

401
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,394
Nonsense.

402
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,682
- What's up, lieutenant?
- We're taking number four to surgery.

403
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:47,643
- Have him ready.
- How come?

404
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:51,798
- The beast's throat's nearly healed.
- The vet's going to geld him.

405
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:55,315
Dr. Zira won't like it.
She wants that pair to mate.

406
00:51:55,421 --> 00:52:00,209
These orders come from Dr. Zaius himself.
There's nothing she can do about it.

407
00:52:14,685 --> 00:52:17,619
If only you knew what they're going to do.

408
00:52:19,548 --> 00:52:22,166
Stay still now. Don't give me any trouble.

409
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:58,297
Weep if you must,
but make an end of sorrow.

410
00:52:58,398 --> 00:53:00,372
He lives again.

411
00:53:01,214 --> 00:53:04,378
Yes, he has found peace in heaven.

412
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:10,553
He was a model for us all,
a gorilla to remember...

413
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,845
Hunter, warrior,

414
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:15,925
defender of the faith.

415
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,868
Cherished husband,

416
00:53:18,973 --> 00:53:20,947
beloved father,

417
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:23,574
generous master, yes.

418
00:53:24,382 --> 00:53:25,757
He was

419
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:28,090
a font of simian kindness.

420
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:36,275
The dear departed once said to me
"I never met an ape I didn't like."

421
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,547
Look! It's a man!

422
00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:42,582
In heaven's name! Get rid of that creature!

423
00:53:42,655 --> 00:53:44,662
Catch him!

424
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:49,110
Catch him! Catch him!

425
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,495
Come on, Quintus.

426
00:57:24,255 --> 00:57:26,262
- Go get him!
- Taylor!

427
00:57:26,335 --> 00:57:28,506
- Why did you run away?
- Security police.

428
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:30,580
I'm in charge of this man.

429
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:33,206
He is in the custody
of the ministry of science.

430
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:36,061
Take your stinking paws off me,

431
00:57:36,127 --> 00:57:38,396
you damn dirty ape!

432
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:49,910
No one'll listen to me.

433
00:57:52,096 --> 00:57:54,103
Only you.

434
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:58,807
You.

435
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:01,692
Nova.

436
00:58:01,793 --> 00:58:04,213
You... Nova.

437
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,294
No...

438
00:58:08,256 --> 00:58:10,296
Yeah. Me Tarzan, you Jane.

439
00:58:18,753 --> 00:58:20,279
What are you doing?

440
00:58:20,353 --> 00:58:21,694
Leave her alone,

441
00:58:21,825 --> 00:58:22,839
damn you!

442
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:24,919
Where are you taking her?

443
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:36,064
Where are you taking her?

444
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:52,159
Damn you! You hairy scum!

445
00:58:52,226 --> 00:58:54,266
Shut up, you freak!

446
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:56,161
Julius, you...

447
00:58:56,226 --> 00:58:57,851
I said shut up!

448
00:58:57,923 --> 00:58:59,646
It's a madhouse!

449
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:02,520
A madhouse!

450
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,475
Now I don't even have you.

451
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,155
Imagine me needing someone.

452
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:24,024
Back on Earth I never did.
Oh, there were women. Lots of women.

453
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,100
Lots of... lovemaking, but no love.

454
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:30,019
That was the kind of world we'd made.

455
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:32,090
So I left

456
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:34,946
because there was no one to hold me there.

457
00:59:35,013 --> 00:59:37,020
Did I tell you about Stewart?

458
00:59:37,093 --> 00:59:39,711
Now there was a lovely girl.

459
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,528
The most precious cargo we'd brought along.

460
00:59:42,628 --> 00:59:45,978
She was... to be the new Eve.

461
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:49,566
With our hot and eager help, of course.

462
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:54,110
Probably just as well
she didn't make it this far.

463
00:59:57,605 --> 00:59:59,579
Do you love me, I wonder?

464
00:59:59,685 --> 01:00:03,035
Can you love, I wonder?

465
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:11,324
Well...

466
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:14,496
You're not as smart as Stewart, but

467
01:00:14,566 --> 01:00:16,572
you're the only girl in town.

468
01:00:22,055 --> 01:00:24,476
Look at that. I...

469
01:00:24,551 --> 01:00:26,655
I taught you to smile.

470
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:51,140
It's been weeks.
What happened? Where have you been?

471
01:01:51,242 --> 01:01:53,217
Why didn't you come to see me?

472
01:01:53,291 --> 01:01:55,297
- What is this?
- A hearing.

473
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,759
- Be clever. Be quiet.
- All rise!

474
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,067
Be seated!

475
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:14,499
This ad hoc tribunal of
the National Academy is now in session.

476
01:02:14,572 --> 01:02:17,091
The president of the Academy presiding.

477
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:21,897
On my right, Dr. Maximus, commissioner
for animal affairs. And on my left,

478
01:02:21,995 --> 01:02:26,753
Dr. Zaius, minister of science
and chief defender of the faith.

479
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:31,017
And appearing for the state,
Dr. Honorious, deputy minister of justice.

480
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:38,761
Bailiff! Your instructions:
To clean up the beast.

481
01:02:38,859 --> 01:02:43,945
These rags he's wearing give off a stench
that's offensive to the dignity

482
01:02:44,045 --> 01:02:46,346
of this tribunal.

483
01:02:54,445 --> 01:02:56,267
You may proceed,

484
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:59,397
- Dr. Honorious.
- By your leave, Mr. President,

485
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:03,527
this tribunal has not yet defined
the purpose for this inquiry.

486
01:03:05,357 --> 01:03:08,521
You asked for the opportunity
to present your case.

487
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:10,955
Surely you must know why you're here.

488
01:03:11,022 --> 01:03:15,811
At the very least, this man has the right to
know whether there's a charge against him.

489
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:16,900
Objection!

490
01:03:16,974 --> 01:03:19,843
This exhibit is indeed a man.

491
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:22,470
Therefore he has no rights under ape law.

492
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:25,643
Dr. Zira, this is a man,

493
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:29,800
- is it not?
- He is unlike any man you have ever seen.

494
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:31,878
As we hope to prove.

495
01:03:31,983 --> 01:03:35,178
Answer the question, Dr. Zira. Is it a man?

496
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:38,988
Sir, perhaps the... question
is the point at issue.

497
01:03:39,055 --> 01:03:41,575
Is he a man, is he a deviant,

498
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,653
or... a freak of nature?

499
01:03:43,759 --> 01:03:45,733
- Objection!
- Sustained.

500
01:03:45,807 --> 01:03:48,873
Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness,

501
01:03:48,976 --> 01:03:51,693
you must admit that
the accused is a non-ape

502
01:03:51,759 --> 01:03:54,344
and therefore has no rights under ape law.

503
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:56,487
Then why is he called the accused?

504
01:03:56,558 --> 01:03:59,591
Your Honors must think him
guilty of something.

505
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:06,127
The creature's not being tried.
He's being disposed of.

506
01:04:06,224 --> 01:04:09,768
It is scientific heresy that is being tried here.

507
01:04:09,872 --> 01:04:11,846
Well put, Dr. Zaius.

508
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,287
Let us warn our friends

509
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:18,345
that they endanger their own careers
by defending this animal.

510
01:04:19,537 --> 01:04:21,642
Then I'll... defend myself.

511
01:04:25,265 --> 01:04:27,752
Dr. Zira, would you tell

512
01:04:27,825 --> 01:04:30,028
Bright Eyes to be quiet?

513
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:32,748
- My name is Taylor!
- Bailiff! Silence the animal!

514
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:36,008
Wait! Let me...

515
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:40,807
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

516
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:44,230
Learned judges, my case is simple.

517
01:04:44,306 --> 01:04:46,826
It is based on our first article of faith.

518
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:50,127
That the almighty created the ape
in his own image.

519
01:04:50,226 --> 01:04:52,592
That he gave him a soul and a mind.

520
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:57,905
That he set him apart from the beasts of the
jungle and made him the lord of the planet.

521
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,425
These sacred truths are self-evident.

522
01:05:01,267 --> 01:05:04,049
The proper study of apes is apes.

523
01:05:05,586 --> 01:05:08,684
But certain young cynics
have chosen to study man.

524
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:15,470
Yes! Perverted scientists who advance
an insidious theory called evolution.

525
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:18,124
Come to the point, Dr. Honorious.

526
01:05:18,227 --> 01:05:22,352
The state charges that Dr. Zira
and a corrupt surgeon named Galen

527
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:25,134
experimented on this wounded animal,

528
01:05:25,236 --> 01:05:30,058
tampering with his brain and throat tissues,
to produce a speaking monster.

529
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:31,505
That's a lie!

530
01:05:31,572 --> 01:05:33,197
Mind your tongue, madam.

531
01:05:33,268 --> 01:05:36,170
Did we create his mind as well?

532
01:05:36,276 --> 01:05:38,250
Not only can this man speak,

533
01:05:38,324 --> 01:05:40,877
he can think! He can reason.

534
01:05:43,028 --> 01:05:45,002
That can reason?

535
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:50,475
With the tribunal's permission, allow me
to expose this hoax by direct examination.

536
01:05:50,548 --> 01:05:53,810
Proceed, doctor. But do not
turn this hearing into a farce.

537
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:04,815
Tell the court, Bright Eyes,
what is the second article of faith?

538
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:09,002
I know nothing of your culture. I admit that.

539
01:06:09,109 --> 01:06:13,070
Of course he doesn't know our culture,
because he cannot think!

540
01:06:14,486 --> 01:06:17,933
Tell us... Why are all apes created equal?

541
01:06:19,157 --> 01:06:21,644
Some apes, it seems,
are more equal than others.

542
01:06:21,718 --> 01:06:22,732
Ridiculous!

543
01:06:22,838 --> 01:06:24,846
Tell us, Bright Eyes.

544
01:06:24,918 --> 01:06:26,892
Why do men have no souls?

545
01:06:26,998 --> 01:06:30,925
What is the proof that a divine spark
exists in the simian brain?

546
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,126
Read this for me.

547
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,633
Since the defendant has been forbidden
to speak in his own defense,

548
01:06:55,704 --> 01:06:58,900
he requests that the following statement

549
01:06:58,967 --> 01:07:00,974
be read into the record.

550
01:07:01,048 --> 01:07:03,534
You read it, Dr. Cornelius. Read it.

551
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:11,597
"I have, uh, come to you from a planet
in a different solar system."

552
01:07:11,704 --> 01:07:14,124
"I am an explorer in space..."

553
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:16,687
Stop right there. Let me see that paper.

554
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:24,881
It's a joke.

555
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,695
In very poor taste.

556
01:07:27,768 --> 01:07:30,451
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?

557
01:07:30,553 --> 01:07:31,763
Dr. Zira,

558
01:07:31,865 --> 01:07:37,494
you state here that a ship from outer space
sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.

559
01:07:37,561 --> 01:07:41,139
You state that Bright Eyes had
two intelligent companions with him

560
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:43,096
at the time of his capture.

561
01:07:43,194 --> 01:07:45,048
That is his assertion.

562
01:07:45,147 --> 01:07:47,120
Mr. President,

563
01:07:47,225 --> 01:07:52,014
in addition to Bright Eyes,
I believe the prosecutor has reassembled

564
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:55,734
all the surviving humans
that were captured in the hunt.

565
01:07:55,802 --> 01:07:57,590
That's true, Dr. Zaius.

566
01:07:57,658 --> 01:07:59,632
Very well.

567
01:07:59,738 --> 01:08:02,585
Then I suggest that we...
go take a look at 'em.

568
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:41,620
That's him! That's Landon!

569
01:08:41,692 --> 01:08:44,058
- Which one?
- The tall one in the back.

570
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:49,524
Do you acknowledge kinship
with any of these creatures?

571
01:08:49,628 --> 01:08:53,205
- With one of them, yes.
- Identify him, then. Speak to him.

572
01:08:55,196 --> 01:08:57,170
Landon?

573
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,283
Landon.

574
01:09:04,445 --> 01:09:06,649
Oh! They cut him!

575
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:11,156
Did you know about this?

576
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:14,774
No. I... I swear. I never saw this man before.

577
01:09:14,845 --> 01:09:16,818
But they...

578
01:09:18,429 --> 01:09:19,508
You did it.

579
01:09:20,638 --> 01:09:23,540
You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon!

580
01:09:23,646 --> 01:09:25,620
Stop him!

581
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,876
Take him inside!

582
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,567
Mr. President, a word of explanation.

583
01:10:20,673 --> 01:10:23,323
The human specimen you saw outside

584
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:26,775
suffered a skull fracture
in the course of the hunt.

585
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:31,834
Two fine veterinary surgeons under
my direction were able to save his life.

586
01:10:31,905 --> 01:10:34,325
But the beast could not speak, of course.

587
01:10:34,465 --> 01:10:36,439
Nor will he ever speak.

588
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:38,520
You did that to him, damn you!

589
01:10:38,594 --> 01:10:42,206
Cut out his memory, took his identity,
and that's what you wanna do to me!

590
01:10:42,274 --> 01:10:44,061
Bailiff! Gag the animal!

591
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:46,103
Damn you!

592
01:10:48,289 --> 01:10:50,263
May it please the tribunal,

593
01:10:50,337 --> 01:10:54,135
I grant you that this creature
cannot have come from another planet.

594
01:10:54,241 --> 01:10:58,299
But this much is certain. He does come
from somewhere in the forbidden zone.

595
01:10:58,402 --> 01:11:02,777
He's described the region to us and described
it accurately for... I have been there.

596
01:11:02,882 --> 01:11:04,856
You visited the forbidden zone?

597
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:06,206
Yes, sir.

598
01:11:06,273 --> 01:11:08,728
A year ago.
With the permission of the Academy.

599
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:12,958
He exceeded his orders.
His travel permit was canceled immediately.

600
01:11:13,059 --> 01:11:15,033
Yes, sir. That is true, thanks to you.

601
01:11:15,107 --> 01:11:17,659
But not before I discovered evidence

602
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:22,203
of a simian culture that existed
long before the sacred scrolls were written.

603
01:11:22,307 --> 01:11:25,919
Objection! These remarks
are profane and irrelevant!

604
01:11:25,988 --> 01:11:31,519
Sustained. Your archaeological theories have
no bearing on the disposition of this creature.

605
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:34,456
Let them talk, Mr. President. Let them talk.

606
01:11:34,563 --> 01:11:38,839
Sirs, our theories
have a bearing on his identity.

607
01:11:38,915 --> 01:11:40,737
How so?

608
01:11:40,803 --> 01:11:44,153
Let us assume, as common sense dictates,

609
01:11:44,228 --> 01:11:47,162
that the prisoner's story is false.

610
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,529
But if he did not come from another planet,

611
01:11:50,596 --> 01:11:53,465
then surely he sprang from our own.

612
01:11:54,948 --> 01:11:57,851
Yes! Sprang! As an animal psychologist,

613
01:11:57,989 --> 01:12:03,225
I have found no physiological defect
to explain why humans are mute.

614
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,088
- Objection!
- Sustained!

615
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:10,143
Their speech organs are adequate.
The flaw lies not in anatomy, but in the brain.

616
01:12:10,213 --> 01:12:12,219
- Objection!
- Sustained!

617
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:15,741
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!

618
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:18,234
Yes! Behold this marvel!

619
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:20,316
This living paradox!

620
01:12:20,389 --> 01:12:22,843
This missing link in an evolutionary chain!

621
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:24,507
Silence there!

622
01:12:24,581 --> 01:12:26,042
You go too far.

623
01:12:26,117 --> 01:12:28,386
I think an indictment is in order.

624
01:12:28,454 --> 01:12:33,375
Yes, sir. The state charges Drs Zira and
Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal,

625
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:36,412
malicious mischief, and scientific heresy.

626
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:38,493
It is so ordered.

627
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:42,722
This tribunal will examine the evidence
and in due course render its verdict.

628
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:46,368
As to the proposed indictment
and as to the disposition

629
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:48,860
of the deviate in question,

630
01:12:48,934 --> 01:12:50,460
this hearing is adjourned.

631
01:13:36,393 --> 01:13:38,400
Wait outside.

632
01:13:48,778 --> 01:13:50,751
Well, the verdict is in.

633
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:57,534
At the moment, your two simian friends
and sponsors are free on bail.

634
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,609
But they'll soon be brought to trial for heresy.

635
01:14:00,714 --> 01:14:02,687
What about me?

636
01:14:02,825 --> 01:14:06,241
Your case was preordained.

637
01:14:06,314 --> 01:14:09,031
In a way, you did the state a service

638
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:13,831
because you made it possible for us
to expose Zira and Cornelius.

639
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:17,824
Now the tribunal
has placed you in my custody

640
01:14:17,898 --> 01:14:19,905
for final disposition.

641
01:14:21,227 --> 01:14:23,398
Do you realize what that means?

642
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:25,636
No.

643
01:14:25,706 --> 01:14:28,127
Emasculation to begin with.

644
01:14:28,203 --> 01:14:30,341
Then experimental surgery

645
01:14:30,443 --> 01:14:32,832
on the speech centers - on the brain.

646
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:35,523
Eventually a kind of living death.

647
01:14:38,123 --> 01:14:40,097
However,

648
01:14:41,484 --> 01:14:44,102
I have it in my power to grant a reprieve.

649
01:14:44,876 --> 01:14:47,330
That is why I summoned you here tonight.

650
01:14:48,747 --> 01:14:52,806
Tell me who and what you really are
and where you came from,

651
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:55,080
and no veterinary shall touch you.

652
01:14:55,148 --> 01:14:57,634
I told you that at that hearing of yours.

653
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,714
You lied!

654
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,794
Where is your tribe?

655
01:15:01,868 --> 01:15:03,875
My tribe!

656
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:07,243
They live on another planet
in another solar system.

657
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:10,635
Even in your lies, some truth slips through.

658
01:15:10,701 --> 01:15:14,923
That mythical community
you're supposed to come from - Fort Wayne.

659
01:15:15,021 --> 01:15:16,995
- What about it?
- A fort!

660
01:15:17,774 --> 01:15:21,122
Unconsciously you chose a name
that was belligerent.

661
01:15:21,197 --> 01:15:23,171
Where were you nurtured?

662
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:30,666
Then... you don't believe that prosecutor's
charge that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira?

663
01:15:30,766 --> 01:15:32,740
Certainly not.

664
01:15:34,669 --> 01:15:37,090
You're a mutant.

665
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:41,094
That's what Zira and Cornelius claim.
You're talking heresy, doctor.

666
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:43,140
Of course!

667
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:47,044
Suppose I am a mutant.
How can the appearance of one mutant

668
01:15:47,118 --> 01:15:50,184
- send you into a panic?
- Because you're not unique.

669
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:53,636
- There's the one you call Landon.
- Oh. Then you admit that...

670
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:58,085
I admit that where there's one mutant,
there's probably another and another.

671
01:15:58,191 --> 01:16:00,362
A whole nest of them.

672
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,503
Where is your nest, Taylor?

673
01:16:02,607 --> 01:16:04,580
Where are your women?

674
01:16:04,655 --> 01:16:06,695
Thank you.

675
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,807
Thank you for calling me Taylor.

676
01:16:08,879 --> 01:16:10,886
Dr. Zaius,

677
01:16:10,959 --> 01:16:12,967
I know who I am.

678
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,013
But who are you?

679
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,829
How in hell did this upside-down
civilization get started?

680
01:16:18,927 --> 01:16:22,058
You may well call it upside down,

681
01:16:22,128 --> 01:16:24,429
since you occupy its lowest level.

682
01:16:24,528 --> 01:16:26,501
And deservedly so.

683
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:31,815
Our eastern desert has never been explored

684
01:16:32,432 --> 01:16:36,686
because we've always assumed
that life cannot exist there.

685
01:16:36,784 --> 01:16:39,784
Taylor, save yourself!

686
01:16:39,889 --> 01:16:44,559
Tell me, is there another jungle
beyond the forbidden zone?

687
01:16:44,657 --> 01:16:46,794
I don't know.

688
01:16:46,865 --> 01:16:51,818
If you're trying to protect others of your kind,
it'll cost you your identity.

689
01:16:51,889 --> 01:16:53,896
I'm not protecting anyone.

690
01:16:53,969 --> 01:16:56,456
This whole thing is insane!
What have I done?

691
01:17:02,194 --> 01:17:04,463
You are a menace.

692
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,734
A walking pestilence!

693
01:17:06,802 --> 01:17:09,616
I do know who you are, Taylor.

694
01:17:11,537 --> 01:17:15,182
I'll give you just six hours
to make a full confession.

695
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:18,000
After that I shall use surgery to obtain one.

696
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:19,407
Guards!

697
01:17:19,475 --> 01:17:22,605
All right. You can cut pieces out of me.
You've got the power.

698
01:17:22,706 --> 01:17:24,877
Return this creature to his cage.

699
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:26,920
But you do it out of fear!

700
01:17:26,994 --> 01:17:31,729
Remember that! Because you're afraid of me!
What are you afraid of, doctor?

701
01:17:52,724 --> 01:17:54,730
Are you Julius?

702
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:58,666
- Who are you?
- I'm from the office of animal affairs.

703
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:03,404
That male is to be transferred to the zoo.

704
01:18:03,477 --> 01:18:05,166
At this hour?

705
01:18:05,236 --> 01:18:06,894
Who says so?

706
01:18:06,964 --> 01:18:09,168
Don't they tell you anything?

707
01:18:09,236 --> 01:18:12,913
The antivivisectionist society is up in arms.

708
01:18:13,013 --> 01:18:16,809
They're gonna save this beast
from those butchers in the lab.

709
01:18:16,884 --> 01:18:20,911
If he can speak, he belongs in a public zoo,
but what'll probably happen

710
01:18:20,981 --> 01:18:25,258
is some money-mad grown-up'll put him
in a circus, and we'll have to pay...

711
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:28,016
Stop making speeches
and show me the order!

712
01:18:43,158 --> 01:18:45,525
This order's no good.

713
01:18:46,615 --> 01:18:49,265
It must be countersigned by Dr. Zaius.

714
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:51,213
Grab him!

715
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:57,905
Who are you?

716
01:18:57,975 --> 01:18:59,948
So you can talk!

717
01:19:00,055 --> 01:19:03,186
I'm Dr. Zira's nephew.
This abduction was her idea.

718
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:05,456
You're not really going to the zoo.

719
01:19:05,526 --> 01:19:07,632
That's our story if somebody stops us.

720
01:19:07,736 --> 01:19:09,710
Get me out of this.

721
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:13,973
We've gotta move fast!

722
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,348
She comes along too.

723
01:19:18,455 --> 01:19:21,203
- Zira doesn't want your female.
- I want her.

724
01:19:22,136 --> 01:19:24,885
If you insist, but I'm not taking any orders.

725
01:19:24,984 --> 01:19:26,958
All right. Come on! Let's go!

726
01:19:48,793 --> 01:19:52,568
- I told you not to bring the other one!
- He wouldn't leave her.

727
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:54,638
Oh, all right. Come on!

728
01:20:02,073 --> 01:20:05,388
- Here. Put this on.
- Don't you have any clothes for me?

729
01:20:05,496 --> 01:20:07,830
What do you expect? An ape's new suit?

730
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:11,860
- This stuff stinks!
- Well, so do you. Like all men.

731
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:13,937
Taylor, remember,

732
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,081
all men look alike to most apes.

733
01:20:16,154 --> 01:20:20,376
So put it on and keep quiet,
and we may just get away with this. Hurry!

734
01:21:09,244 --> 01:21:11,479
Cornelius!

735
01:21:19,549 --> 01:21:20,792
How'd it go?

736
01:21:23,164 --> 01:21:24,243
Come on!

737
01:21:24,317 --> 01:21:26,324
Let me out of this!

738
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,394
Well, Taylor, we're all fugitives now.

739
01:21:37,502 --> 01:21:40,185
Do you have any weapons? Any guns?

740
01:21:40,253 --> 01:21:42,325
The best. But we won't need them.

741
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,764
I'm glad to hear it. I want one anyway.

742
01:21:53,278 --> 01:21:55,611
Taylor, I'm in charge of this expedition!

743
01:21:55,709 --> 01:21:59,418
Good for you.
But you're not in charge of me. Not any more.

744
01:21:59,485 --> 01:22:01,493
I don't plan to be caught again.

745
01:22:03,424 --> 01:22:06,489
- As you wish.
- Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was

746
01:22:06,559 --> 01:22:09,276
another jungle beyond the forbidden zone.

747
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:11,349
I'll try for that. What about you?

748
01:22:11,455 --> 01:22:14,172
Cornelius and I have been
indicted for heresy.

749
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:18,068
Unless we can prove our theories,
we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

750
01:22:18,176 --> 01:22:20,347
You're going back to the forbidden zone?

751
01:22:20,415 --> 01:22:23,546
We're going back to the diggings
I worked at over a year ago.

752
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,754
It's a three-day ride across the desert.

753
01:22:25,856 --> 01:22:28,921
Near where you claim you landed
from that planet of yours.

754
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:32,636
- You still don't believe me, do you?
- It's a long detour to Dead Lake.

755
01:22:32,704 --> 01:22:34,711
- What would we find?
- Nothing much.

756
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:40,053
An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a...
little flag, the emblem of my countrymen.

757
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:42,550
The terrain around that lake

758
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:46,617
is poisonous. There's no fresh water,
no vegetation - nothing.

759
01:22:50,561 --> 01:22:54,652
Anyway, I... ought to thank you
for saving me. You'll be in trouble for that.

760
01:22:56,289 --> 01:22:59,322
We've been in trouble
since the moment we met you.

761
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:04,824
What's she pointing at?

762
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:07,800
This must be close to home for her.
She knows it.

763
01:23:11,682 --> 01:23:13,982
Nova, no. Nova!

764
01:23:14,081 --> 01:23:16,928
Nova, you can't go there! It's not safe! Nova!

765
01:23:20,707 --> 01:23:25,245
We'd better get started. If the mounted police
pick up our trail, they'll come this far.

766
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:28,926
Right. Let's get the water
and provisions into the wagon.

767
01:24:37,957 --> 01:24:39,932
Cornelius!

768
01:24:43,013 --> 01:24:44,987
Where does this river lead to?

769
01:24:45,094 --> 01:24:49,949
It flows into a sea some miles from here.
That's where we'll find the diggings.

770
01:24:50,054 --> 01:24:52,027
And beyond that?

771
01:24:52,101 --> 01:24:55,844
I don't know. You can't ride
along the shore at high tide

772
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:58,692
and we had no boats on our last expedition.

773
01:24:58,759 --> 01:25:02,174
You never told me -
why do you call this the forbidden zone?

774
01:25:03,046 --> 01:25:08,480
No one knows. It's an ancient taboo,
set forth in the sacred scrolls.

775
01:25:08,551 --> 01:25:11,585
The lawgiver pronounced
this whole area deadly.

776
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:15,709
Shouldn't we be moving on?

777
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:18,333
I'm for that.

778
01:26:43,466 --> 01:26:45,473
Well? Do you like it?

779
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:52,737
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?

780
01:26:52,843 --> 01:26:56,455
In my world, when I left it,
only kids your age wore beards.

781
01:26:57,227 --> 01:26:58,721
Beards?

782
01:26:58,795 --> 01:27:00,802
I don't go in for fads.

783
01:27:01,644 --> 01:27:03,749
Somehow

784
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:06,208
it makes you look less intelligent.

785
01:27:07,148 --> 01:27:09,668
When will you show me what's in that cave?

786
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,747
Right now, if you like.

787
01:27:30,764 --> 01:27:31,778
Cornelius!

788
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:45,444
- Lucius, don't fire at them!
- You're all under arrest!

789
01:27:49,581 --> 01:27:54,633
If there's any more shooting, Dr. Zaius,
you'll be the first to go. You can count on it.

790
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,255
You are not in command. Put down that gun.

791
01:27:57,327 --> 01:27:58,472
Shut up!

792
01:27:58,542 --> 01:28:00,428
Very well.

793
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:01,801
Lower your weapons.

794
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:05,415
Tell them to pull back around the rocks,
out of range.

795
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:08,133
Withdraw!

796
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,757
How did you know we'd come here?

797
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:19,336
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate
would flee to the forbidden zone.

798
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:22,473
And only a fool
would give a gun to an animal.

799
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:26,374
I see you've brought
the female of your species.

800
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,092
I didn't realize
that man could be monogamous.

801
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,133
On this planet it's easy.

802
01:28:33,263 --> 01:28:36,875
I'll ask you to reconsider
the rash course you've undertaken.

803
01:28:36,943 --> 01:28:42,126
If you're convicted of heresy,
the most you'll get is two years, but

804
01:28:42,224 --> 01:28:47,242
if you persist in pointing guns in
my direction, you'll hang for high treason.

805
01:28:47,312 --> 01:28:49,865
We never meant to be treasonous, sir.

806
01:28:49,936 --> 01:28:53,928
But up there, in the face of that cliff,
there is a vast cave,

807
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,862
and in that cave a fabulous treasure
of fossils and artifacts.

808
01:28:57,968 --> 01:29:01,513
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts.
They're worthless.

809
01:29:01,617 --> 01:29:03,591
There's your minister of science.

810
01:29:03,697 --> 01:29:06,663
Honor-bound to expand
the frontiers of knowledge.

811
01:29:06,768 --> 01:29:10,347
- Taylor, please!
- Except he's also chief defender of the faith.

812
01:29:10,449 --> 01:29:14,507
There is no contradiction
between faith and science - true science.

813
01:29:14,578 --> 01:29:17,893
- Are you willing to put it to the test?
- Taylor, I would rather...

814
01:29:17,969 --> 01:29:21,995
Take it easy. You saved me from this fanatic.
Maybe I can return the favor.

815
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,072
What is your proposal?

816
01:29:24,849 --> 01:29:27,882
When were those sacred scrolls
of yours written?

817
01:29:27,954 --> 01:29:29,677
1,200 years ago.

818
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:34,600
All right. If they can prove those scrolls
don't tell the whole truth of your history,

819
01:29:34,674 --> 01:29:36,910
if they can find some real evidence

820
01:29:36,978 --> 01:29:40,589
of another culture from some remote past,
will you let them off?

821
01:29:40,658 --> 01:29:43,506
- Of course.
- Let's go up to the cave.

822
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:51,822
Sorry, Lucius. You've got to stay here
and guard the camp.

823
01:29:51,923 --> 01:29:54,890
Always giving orders.
Just like every other adult.

824
01:29:54,995 --> 01:29:57,450
Relax. You'll get to see it all later on.

825
01:30:57,013 --> 01:30:59,402
Present your evidence, Cornelius.

826
01:30:59,509 --> 01:31:04,528
It was at this level that I discovered
traces of an early ape creature.

827
01:31:04,598 --> 01:31:10,063
A stage of primitive barbarism really,
dating back some 1,300 years roughly.

828
01:31:10,166 --> 01:31:15,501
It was at this level... I discovered
cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz

829
01:31:15,606 --> 01:31:18,955
and the fossilized bones
of carnivorous gorillas.

830
01:31:19,702 --> 01:31:22,123
But the artifacts

831
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:24,271
Lying here

832
01:31:25,335 --> 01:31:28,149
were found at this level,

833
01:31:28,214 --> 01:31:31,181
and date back... 700 years earlier.

834
01:31:31,286 --> 01:31:33,294
That's the paradox.

835
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:36,815
For the more ancient culture
is the more advanced.

836
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:40,628
Now, admittedly,
many of these objects are unidentified.

837
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:44,786
But clearly they were fashioned
by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.

838
01:31:44,856 --> 01:31:48,883
Indeed, the fact that many of these tools
are unknown to us

839
01:31:49,017 --> 01:31:53,358
suggests a culture which
in certain ways equals our own.

840
01:31:53,464 --> 01:31:55,853
Some of the evidence is uncontestable.

841
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:59,604
Don't speak to me in absolutes.
The evidence is contestable!

842
01:32:00,792 --> 01:32:02,481
I apologize, sir.

843
01:32:02,551 --> 01:32:06,545
To begin with, your methods of dating
the past are crude to say the least.

844
01:32:06,617 --> 01:32:10,392
There are geologists on my staff
who'd laugh at your speculations.

845
01:32:10,457 --> 01:32:12,463
But there's the doll, sir.

846
01:32:12,537 --> 01:32:14,577
What?

847
01:32:14,649 --> 01:32:17,038
Oh, lying right there. The human doll.

848
01:32:23,449 --> 01:32:27,540
What does this prove?
My granddaughter plays with human dolls.

849
01:32:29,241 --> 01:32:32,023
The doll was found
beside the jawbone of a man

850
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:35,569
and no trace of simian fossil
has been found in this deposit.

851
01:32:35,705 --> 01:32:37,680
Your conclusion is premature.

852
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:40,786
Have you forgotten your scripture?
The 13th scroll?

853
01:32:40,891 --> 01:32:45,712
"And Proteus brought the upright beast
into the garden and chained him to a tree,

854
01:32:45,786 --> 01:32:49,910
- and the children did make sport of him."
- No, sir, I have not forgotten.

855
01:32:49,978 --> 01:32:54,321
Well, for a time the ancients
kept humans as household pets

856
01:32:54,395 --> 01:32:58,223
until our lawgiver proved
that man could not be tamed.

857
01:32:59,131 --> 01:33:03,953
Keep digging, Cornelius. You'll find evidence
of the master of this house...

858
01:33:05,307 --> 01:33:07,542
An ape.

859
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:11,411
What are you doing?

860
01:33:11,483 --> 01:33:14,352
Reconstructing a past life.

861
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,194
You say these things were found
at the same level as that doll?

862
01:33:19,292 --> 01:33:22,739
Whoever owned them
must have been in pretty bad shape.

863
01:33:22,812 --> 01:33:24,820
He wore false teeth.

864
01:33:25,789 --> 01:33:27,763
And eyeglasses.

865
01:33:28,509 --> 01:33:30,842
He had a failing heart.

866
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:36,184
Towards the end, he... had
this prefabricated valve put in it.

867
01:33:38,173 --> 01:33:40,474
I don't say he was a man
like I knew at home,

868
01:33:40,572 --> 01:33:44,314
but he must have been a close relative.
He had all the same weaknesses.

869
01:33:45,405 --> 01:33:47,379
He was a weak,

870
01:33:47,486 --> 01:33:49,460
fragile animal.

871
01:33:49,597 --> 01:33:51,570
But he was here before you

872
01:33:51,644 --> 01:33:53,651
and he was better than you are.

873
01:33:53,725 --> 01:33:59,323
That's lunacy! I can offer alternate
descriptions of every one of those articles

874
01:33:59,422 --> 01:34:02,268
which is just as ingenious as yours.

875
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:05,082
But it'd be conjecture, not proof.

876
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,003
Mamma!

877
01:34:13,502 --> 01:34:15,706
Mamma!

878
01:34:17,886 --> 01:34:21,912
Dr. Zaius, would an ape make a human doll

879
01:34:21,983 --> 01:34:23,444
that talks?

880
01:34:27,999 --> 01:34:29,046
Lucius!

881
01:34:31,552 --> 01:34:33,559
You dirty...

882
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:34,907
Nova!

883
01:34:54,496 --> 01:34:55,575
Nova!

884
01:35:31,745 --> 01:35:33,501
Cornelius!

885
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:35,392
Zira!

886
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:37,432
Help me!

887
01:35:39,459 --> 01:35:41,432
Mamma!

888
01:35:47,747 --> 01:35:49,721
I oughta kill you right now.

889
01:35:49,826 --> 01:35:51,167
Come on!

890
01:35:52,546 --> 01:35:54,520
Tell 'em to pull back. Now!

891
01:35:54,626 --> 01:35:56,993
Cease fire! Withdraw!

892
01:35:59,074 --> 01:36:00,383
Up there!

893
01:36:00,451 --> 01:36:02,458
Withdraw!

894
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:06,522
Get down!

895
01:36:19,428 --> 01:36:21,402
Lucius, are you all right?

896
01:36:21,508 --> 01:36:23,679
They took me by surprise.

897
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:27,161
Sneaked up on me
while I was feeding the horses.

898
01:36:27,267 --> 01:36:29,241
What's happened to honor?

899
01:36:30,564 --> 01:36:32,538
I got off two rounds to warn you.

900
01:36:32,644 --> 01:36:36,256
- They've taken everything.
- Not quite everything!

901
01:36:36,325 --> 01:36:39,193
They left a hostage behind.

902
01:36:39,268 --> 01:36:41,918
- How are you feeling?
- Disillusioned.

903
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:44,409
You can't trust the older generation.

904
01:36:44,517 --> 01:36:46,688
I know what you mean.

905
01:36:46,757 --> 01:36:50,848
I want you to go round the rocks and tell
those gorillas I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner.

906
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:52,989
Yes, I can do that.

907
01:36:53,061 --> 01:36:57,185
I want a horse, food, and water.
Enough for a week for me and this female.

908
01:36:57,254 --> 01:37:01,214
- And 50 rounds of ammunition.
- What if they won't agree to your terms?

909
01:37:01,285 --> 01:37:03,227
Tell them I'll shoot him.

910
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:05,307
Taylor, you can't!

911
01:37:05,381 --> 01:37:07,421
Oh, yes, he can.

912
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:10,110
He's a born killer.

913
01:37:10,181 --> 01:37:12,221
Deliver the message.

914
01:37:13,798 --> 01:37:15,805
Over here.

915
01:37:19,110 --> 01:37:21,247
Sit down.

916
01:37:36,679 --> 01:37:40,574
Taylor, please! Don't treat him like that!

917
01:37:40,648 --> 01:37:43,167
- Why not?
- It's humiliating.

918
01:37:44,487 --> 01:37:47,869
The way I was humiliated... by all of you?

919
01:37:47,943 --> 01:37:49,917
You led me around on a leash!

920
01:37:50,024 --> 01:37:52,926
That was different.
We thought you were inferior.

921
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,072
Now you know better.

922
01:37:55,176 --> 01:37:57,859
Cornelius was right, doctor. He proved it.

923
01:37:57,928 --> 01:38:01,540
Man was here first. You owe him
your science, your culture,

924
01:38:01,608 --> 01:38:05,404
- whatever civilization you've got.
- Then answer me this.

925
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:08,993
If man was superior, why didn't he survive?

926
01:38:09,064 --> 01:38:12,840
Wiped out by a plague, some natural
catastrophe, a storm of meteors.

927
01:38:12,905 --> 01:38:16,613
From the looks of some parts of this planet,
I'd say that was a fair bet.

928
01:38:16,712 --> 01:38:18,272
But we can't be sure.

929
01:38:18,344 --> 01:38:20,034
He is.

930
01:38:20,137 --> 01:38:24,293
He knew all the time.
Long before you found your cave, he knew.

931
01:38:24,392 --> 01:38:27,872
Defender of the faith?
Guardian of the terrible secret.

932
01:38:27,945 --> 01:38:32,287
- That's it, isn't it, doctor?
- What I know of man was written long ago.

933
01:38:32,362 --> 01:38:35,777
Set down by the greatest ape of all,
our lawgiver.

934
01:38:35,882 --> 01:38:36,961
Cornelius,

935
01:38:37,066 --> 01:38:39,039
come here.

936
01:38:39,145 --> 01:38:42,048
Reach into my pocket. Read to him

937
01:38:42,123 --> 01:38:44,130
the 29th scroll.

938
01:38:44,202 --> 01:38:45,543
6th verse.

939
01:38:49,226 --> 01:38:53,154
"Beware the beast man,
for he is the devil's pawn."

940
01:38:53,226 --> 01:38:55,713
"Alone among God's primates,

941
01:38:55,786 --> 01:38:59,877
he kills for sport or lust or greed."

942
01:39:00,778 --> 01:39:04,804
"Yea, he will murder his brother
to possess his brother's land."

943
01:39:04,907 --> 01:39:07,656
"Let him not breed in great numbers,

944
01:39:07,755 --> 01:39:11,910
for he will make a desert
of his home and yours."

945
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:13,985
"Shun him."

946
01:39:14,123 --> 01:39:16,578
"Drive him back into his jungle lair."

947
01:39:16,651 --> 01:39:19,782
"For he is the harbinger of death."

948
01:39:21,676 --> 01:39:25,024
I found nothing in the cave
to alter that conception of man

949
01:39:25,099 --> 01:39:27,041
and I still live by its injunction.

950
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:37,507
That's far enough!

951
01:39:44,331 --> 01:39:46,787
They think you're behaving foolishly.

952
01:39:47,437 --> 01:39:49,444
I must say, I agree!

953
01:39:49,517 --> 01:39:51,557
Where will you go?

954
01:39:51,629 --> 01:39:54,889
To start with, I'll follow
the shoreline and my nose.

955
01:39:54,988 --> 01:39:58,119
But suppose you find nothing
but... but wasteland?

956
01:39:58,188 --> 01:40:00,228
How will you survive?

957
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:01,827
He won't survive.

958
01:40:06,606 --> 01:40:08,613
Nova.

959
01:40:11,342 --> 01:40:13,316
How about coming along?

960
01:40:13,422 --> 01:40:16,520
- We can't.
- It's better than going to jail for heresy.

961
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:18,728
Oh, they can't convict us of heresy.

962
01:40:18,830 --> 01:40:21,034
You've helped prove our innocence.

963
01:40:21,134 --> 01:40:23,501
Besides... his culture

964
01:40:23,598 --> 01:40:25,802
is our culture.

965
01:40:25,903 --> 01:40:28,520
Well, good luck, then.

966
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:36,584
Lucius.

967
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,955
I still say you're making a mistake.

968
01:40:39,022 --> 01:40:41,258
That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.

969
01:40:41,326 --> 01:40:44,009
- What?
- The flags of discontent.

970
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:46,893
Remember, never trust anybody over 30.

971
01:40:46,959 --> 01:40:49,959
Doctor, I'd like to kiss you goodbye.

972
01:40:57,264 --> 01:40:59,238
All right, but

973
01:40:59,344 --> 01:41:01,317
you're so damned ugly.

974
01:41:26,033 --> 01:41:29,197
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.

975
01:41:29,297 --> 01:41:31,271
Of that I'm sure.

976
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:36,493
All my life I've awaited your coming
and dreaded it, like death itself.

977
01:41:36,593 --> 01:41:37,576
Why?

978
01:41:37,650 --> 01:41:41,578
I've terrified you from the first, doctor.
I still do.

979
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:44,333
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?

980
01:41:44,434 --> 01:41:46,571
Because you're a man.

981
01:41:46,641 --> 01:41:48,648
And you're right.

982
01:41:48,753 --> 01:41:51,142
I have always known about man.

983
01:41:52,017 --> 01:41:57,963
From the evidence, I believe his wisdom
must walk hand in hand with his idiocy.

984
01:41:58,066 --> 01:42:00,367
His emotions must rule his brain.

985
01:42:00,434 --> 01:42:03,467
He must be a warlike creature
who gives battle

986
01:42:03,538 --> 01:42:06,221
to everything around him, even himself.

987
01:42:06,322 --> 01:42:09,486
What evidence?
There were no weapons in that cave.

988
01:42:09,587 --> 01:42:12,718
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.

989
01:42:12,787 --> 01:42:16,943
Your breed made a desert of it... ages ago.

990
01:42:17,012 --> 01:42:19,116
It still doesn't give me the why.

991
01:42:19,219 --> 01:42:21,739
A planet where apes evolved from men.

992
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:25,227
There's gotta be an answer.

993
01:42:25,332 --> 01:42:27,306
Don't look for it, Taylor.

994
01:42:28,116 --> 01:42:30,416
You may not like what you find.

995
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:40,394
Untie me!

996
01:42:53,588 --> 01:42:55,562
No, no, no! Wait!

997
01:42:55,668 --> 01:42:57,643
Wait!

998
01:42:57,717 --> 01:42:59,757
Let him go!

999
01:43:01,110 --> 01:43:05,331
Lieutenant, fetch your explosives.
We're going to seal up the cave.

1000
01:43:05,397 --> 01:43:06,673
Yes, sir!

1001
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:08,812
- Seal the cave?
- That is correct.

1002
01:43:08,917 --> 01:43:11,437
And you will both stand trial for heresy.

1003
01:43:11,509 --> 01:43:15,470
- But the proof! The doll!
- In a few minutes there will be no doll.

1004
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:17,548
There can't be. I'm sorry.

1005
01:43:17,622 --> 01:43:18,996
Dr. Zaius!

1006
01:43:19,094 --> 01:43:21,395
Dr. Zaius, you mustn't! You promised!

1007
01:43:21,462 --> 01:43:23,436
What I do, I do with no pleasure.

1008
01:43:23,542 --> 01:43:25,679
- Silence him!
- Doctor.

1009
01:43:25,749 --> 01:43:28,564
Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!

1010
01:43:29,175 --> 01:43:31,564
Why must knowledge stand still?

1011
01:43:31,639 --> 01:43:33,613
What about the future?

1012
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:36,781
I may just have saved it for you.

1013
01:43:39,831 --> 01:43:42,067
What will he find out there, doctor?

1014
01:43:43,351 --> 01:43:45,621
His destiny.

1015
01:45:50,619 --> 01:45:52,627
Oh, my God!

1016
01:45:53,469 --> 01:45:55,476
I'm back!

1017
01:45:56,605 --> 01:45:58,873
I'm home.

1018
01:45:58,941 --> 01:46:01,145
All the time, it was...

1019
01:46:03,165 --> 01:46:05,172
We finally really did it.

1020
01:46:06,237 --> 01:46:08,245
You maniacs!

1021
01:46:09,597 --> 01:46:11,801
You blew it up!

1022
01:46:11,901 --> 01:46:13,875
God damn you!

1023
01:46:14,845 --> 01:46:19,482
God damn you all to hell!
