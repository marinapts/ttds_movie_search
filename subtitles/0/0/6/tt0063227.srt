1
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:03,727
Come for me!

2
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:38,738
You're gaining on it, Johnny.

3
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:41,741
Am I, father? Am I really?

4
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:44,768
Off you go now.
Run along and practice.

5
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:17,711
He'll make a good king.
He'll be ready.

6
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:20,737
That's the way.
Come on, my son!

7
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,718
Have you found religion,
Henry?

8
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:29,757
Will you look down from heaven and
see who's sitting on your throne?

9
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:32,725
I must know before I die.

10
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,765
There's a legend of a king called
Lear, with whom I have a lot in common.

11
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,768
Both of us have kingdoms
and three children we adore,

12
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:43,736
and both of us are old,
but there it ends.

13
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:46,739
He cuts his kingdom into bits.
I can't do that.

14
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:49,777
I've bullt an empire, and
I must know it's going to last.

15
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:51,744
All of Britain,
half of France...

16
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,772
I'm the greatest power in a thousand
years, and after me comes John.

17
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:05,715
I'm going to lose you,
Henry, aren't I?

18
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:09,695
Alais, in my time I've known...

19
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,733
contessas, milkmaids,
courtesans...

20
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:15,736
and novices,
whores, gypsies, jades...

21
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:18,704
and little boys,

22
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:23,733
but nowhere in God's western world
have I found anyone to love but you.

23
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:26,712
And Rosamund?

24
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:30,245
- She's dead.
- And Eleanor.

25
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,743
The new Medusa,
my good wife?

26
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,758
How is your queen?
Decaying, I suppose.

27
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:40,778
No, don't be jealous
of the Gorgon.

28
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,729
She is not
among the things I love.

29
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:47,733
How many husbands do you know
who dungeon up their wives?

30
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:53,774
I haven't kept the great bitch in the keep
for ten years out of passionate attachment.

31
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:58,768
- There's Captain Marshal.
William!

32
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:03,216
We will be holding
Christmas court at chinon.

33
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,684
We have asked the king of France
to join us.

34
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:10,724
I want Richard there and Geoffrey.
Go find my boys and tell them.

35
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,726
Then go fetch the queen
from Salisbury tower.

36
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:16,695
If the queen refuses?
Eleanor?

37
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,722
She wouldn't miss this
for the world.

38
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:22,724
Richard.

39
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,721
Richard!

40
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:34,731
Hello, Richard.

41
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:47,743
Forward!

42
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,049
Forward!

43
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:14,257
Geoffrey?

44
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:17,259
Geoffrey.

45
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:21,740
Geoffrey!

46
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,766
Father wants to see me.

47
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:50,793
Your majesty.

48
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:56,810
There's to be
a Christmas court.

49
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,877
Yes, madam.

50
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:01,847
Where?
At chinon.

51
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:10,083
Henry, what if, just for once,
I didn't do as I was told?

52
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:12,718
It's going to be
a jungle of a day.

53
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:15,085
If I start growling now,
I'll never last.

54
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:17,121
You'll last.

55
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:20,750
You're like the rocks at
stonehenge... nothing knocks you down.

56
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:30,170
In these rooms, Alais, on this
Christmas, I have all the enemies I need.

57
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:34,174
You have more than you think.
Are you one?

58
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:37,200
Has my willow
turned to poison oak?

59
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:40,781
If I decided to be trouble,
Henry, how much trouble could I be?

60
00:12:40,816 --> 00:12:43,215
Not much.

61
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:46,520
I could give away your plans.
You don't know what they are.

62
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:49,256
I know you want to disinherit
Richard. So does Eleanor.

63
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,247
She knows young Henry's dead.

64
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:55,262
The young king died in summer, and I haven't
named an heir. She knows I want John...

65
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:58,799
on the throne, and I know she wants
Richard... we are very frank about it.

66
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,734
Henry, I can't be your mistress
if I'm married to your son.

67
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,732
Why can't you?
Johnny wouldn't mind.

68
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:06,489
I do not like your Johnny.
He's a good boy.

69
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,634
He's got pimples,
and he smells of compost.

70
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:10,744
He's just 16!
He can't help the pimples.

71
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:14,271
He could have a bath!

72
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:17,317
It isn't such a dreadful thing
to be queen of England.

73
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,319
Not all eyes will weep for you.

74
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:22,056
Will yours?
I don't know.

75
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:24,723
Very likely.

76
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:28,562
All I want is not to lose you.
Can't you hide me?

77
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:32,331
Can't I simply disappear?
You know you can't.

78
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:37,404
Your little brother Philip's king of France now,
and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.

79
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:40,739
I only took you for your
dowry. You were seven...

80
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:45,779
two big knees and two big eyes,
and that's all.

81
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:47,770
How was I to know?

82
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:55,785
Hey. What's the matter, lad? Nothing.

83
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:20,479
- Geoff!
- Johnny!

84
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:23,506
Is that for me?
I love Christmas.

85
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:31,723
What difference does
my dowry make?

86
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:35,558
Let Philip have it back.
It isn't much. I can't.

87
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:40,597
The vexin is a little county,
but it's vital to me. And I'm not.

88
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,759
It's been my luck to fall
in love with landed women.

89
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,738
When I married Eleanor
I thought, "you lucky man.

90
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:49,640
"The richest woman in the
world... she owns the Aquitaine,

91
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:53,644
the greatest province in the
continent, and beautiful as well. "

92
00:14:54,781 --> 00:14:58,650
She was, you know.
And you adored her.

93
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:03,622
Memory fails. There may
have been an era when I did.

94
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:08,718
Let's have one strand askew. Nothing
in life has any business being perfect.

95
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:15,669
If I say you and I are done,
we're done.

96
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:19,740
If I say marry John,
it's John.

97
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:22,674
I'll have you by me,

98
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:25,701
and I'll use you as I like.

99
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:39,760
Ah, Christmas...
warm and rosy time.

100
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:42,280
The hot wine steams,
the yule log roars,

101
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,730
and we're the fat
that's in the fire.

102
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:46,732
She'll be here soon,
you know. Who? Mother.

103
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:51,772
She still want you to be king? We
are not as friendly as we used to be.

104
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,763
If I'm supposed to make a fuss
and kiss her hairy cheek, I won't.

105
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,771
What you kiss,
little prince, is up to you.

106
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:59,745
I'm father's favorite.
That's what counts.

107
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,750
You hardly know me, Johnny, so I
beg you to believe my reputation.

108
00:16:03,785 --> 00:16:07,721
I am a constant soldier, a
sometime poet, and I will be king.

109
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:10,736
Just you remember...
father loves me best.

110
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,716
Why John? John doesn't
care for you at all.

111
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:17,731
We love each other deeply. None
of them has any love for you.

112
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:20,699
Because we fight?

113
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:25,739
Tell me all three want the crown. I'll
tell you it's a feeble prince that doesn't.

114
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:30,744
They may snap at me and plot, and that
makes them the kind of sons I want.

115
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,712
I've snapped and plotted
all my life.

116
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:37,751
There's no other way to be a
king, alive and 50 all at once.

117
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:40,743
I'm going to fight for you.
Oh, fine.

118
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:54,745
How was your crossing?
Did the channel part for you?

119
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:58,724
It went flat when I told it to.

120
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,693
I didn't think to ask for more.

121
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:13,762
How dear of you to let me out of
jail. It's only for the holidays.

122
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:19,702
Like school, you keep me young.
Here's gentle Alais.

123
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:24,716
No,
greet me as you used to.

124
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,786
Fragile I am not.

125
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:31,723
Affection is a pressure
I can bear.

126
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:36,730
Oh, but I do have
handsome children.

127
00:19:36,765 --> 00:19:40,699
John, you're so clean and neat.

128
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:43,702
Henry takes good care of you.
And Richard.

129
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:46,900
Don't look sullen, dear. It makes
your eyes go small and piggy...

130
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:49,943
and your chin look weak.

131
00:19:49,978 --> 00:19:52,711
Geoffrey.

132
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:54,737
Is Philip here yet?
Not yet.

133
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:56,745
Let's hope he's
grown up like his father...

134
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,951
Simon pure and Simon simple...
good, good, Louis.

135
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:03,757
If I had managed sons for him
instead of all those little girls,

136
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,992
I'd still be stuck
with being queen of France,

137
00:20:06,027 --> 00:20:08,727
and we should not have
known each other.

138
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:12,027
Such, my angels,
is the role of sex in history.

139
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:16,764
Thatwill be Philip.

140
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:21,039
Where's Henry?
Upstairs with the family whore.

141
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:24,778
That's a mean and tawdry way
to talk about your fiancee.

142
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:27,045
My fiancee.
Whosever fiancee.

143
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,599
I brought her up, and she
is dear to me and gentle.

144
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:32,083
He still plans to make John
king. Of course he does.

145
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:36,755
My, what a greedy little trinity
you are... king, king, king.

146
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,782
Two of you must learn to live with
disappointment. Ah, but which two?

147
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,127
Let's deny them all
and live forever.

148
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:45,154
Tusk to tusk
through all eternity.

149
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,791
Ah, my boys.

150
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:52,205
The king of France and I will
shortly have a tactile conversation,

151
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,172
like two surgeons
looking for a lump.

152
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:57,811
We'll state positions, and I'll make the first
of many offers. He'll refuse it, naturally.

153
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:00,746
I'll make a better one, and so on
through the holidays until I win.

154
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:05,743
For the duration of this joyous ritual
you will give to your father your support.

155
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:58,794
- My lord!
- Your grace!

156
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,364
Welcome to chinon.

157
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:14,750
Ah, that's better.

158
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:22,727
I was told you were impressive
for a boy of 17.

159
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:26,459
- I'm Eleanor, who might have been your mother.
- queen Eleanor.

160
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,733
All the others here you know.

161
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:31,760
I gather you're disturbed
about your sister and her dowry.

162
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:34,739
Sixteen years ago
you made a treaty with us.

163
00:22:34,774 --> 00:22:37,766
- It is time its terms were executed.
- I should think so.

164
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:40,512
Our position comes to this:

165
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:44,050
That you will either hold the
marriage or return the vexin.

166
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:47,554
Alais marries Richard, or we'll
have the county back at once.

167
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:49,789
That's clear, concise
and well presented.

168
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:52,557
My position...

169
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:54,759
well, frankly, Philip,
it's a tangle.

170
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:57,797
Two years ago, the queen and I...
for reasons passing understanding...

171
00:22:57,832 --> 00:23:00,195
gave the Aquitaine to Richard.

172
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,558
That makes Richard
very powerful.

173
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:04,702
How can I give him Alais too?

174
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:07,539
The man she marries
has you for an ally.

175
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:11,601
It's their wedding or the vexin back.
Those are the terms you made with Louis.

176
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:14,579
True, but academic, lad.
The vexin's mine.

177
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:17,742
By what authority? It's got my troops
all over it. That makes it mine.

178
00:23:19,652 --> 00:23:21,619
Now, hear me, boy.

179
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:25,723
I am a king. I am no man's boy. A king?

180
00:23:25,758 --> 00:23:28,659
Because you put your ass
on purple cushions?

181
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:32,730
- Sir.
- Philip.

182
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:35,763
You haven't got
the feel of this at all, lad.

183
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:38,762
Use all your voices.
When I bellow, bellow back.

184
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:44,744
I'll mark that down.
This too:

185
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:46,744
We are the world in small.

186
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:49,771
A nation is a human thing. It
does what we do, for our reasons.

187
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:52,785
Surely if we're civilized,
we can put away the knives.

188
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,754
We can make peace.
We have it in our hands.

189
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:00,692
I've tutors of my own.
Will that be all? Oh, think.

190
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:02,718
You came here for a reason. Don't you
want to ask me if I've got an offer?

191
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,721
Have you got an offer? Not
yet, but I'll think of one.

192
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,724
Oh, by the way,

193
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:12,739
you're better at this
than I thought you'd be.

194
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:15,731
I wasn't sure you'd noticed.

195
00:24:19,746 --> 00:24:23,715
Well, what shall we hang...
the holly or each other?

196
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,755
Would you say, father, that I have
the makings of a king? A splendid king.

197
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,757
And would you expect me, father,
to give up without a fight?

198
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,725
Of course you'll fight.
I raised you to.

199
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,763
I don't care what you offer Philip,
I don't care what plans you make.

200
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:39,766
I'll have the Aquitaine
and Alais and the crown.

201
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:41,733
I'll not give up one
to get the other.

202
00:24:41,768 --> 00:24:45,761
I won't trade off Alais or the
Aquitaine to that walking pustule!

203
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:49,741
No, your loving son will not.

204
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:52,744
Did you hear what he
called me? Clearly, dear.

205
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:56,783
Now, run along. It's nearly dinnertime.
I only do what father tells me.

206
00:24:56,818 --> 00:24:59,751
Go and eat.
Did I say something wrong?

207
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:01,686
I'm always saying something
wrong. And don't pout.

208
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:03,712
I'm not pouting. And stand up straight!
How often do I have to tell you?

209
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:11,720
And that's to be the king.
And I'm to be his chancellor.

210
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:13,723
Has he told you?

211
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,736
John will rule the country
while I run it, that is to say,

212
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:18,703
he gets to spend
the taxes that I raise.

213
00:25:18,738 --> 00:25:22,731
How nice for you. It's
not as nice as being king.

214
00:25:23,376 --> 00:25:24,741
We've made you duke of
brittany. Is that so little?

215
00:25:25,478 --> 00:25:30,750
No one ever thinks of crown
and mentions Geoff. Why is that?

216
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:32,717
Isn't being chancellor
power enough?

217
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:35,755
It's not the power I feel deprived
of. It's the mention I miss.

218
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,723
There's no affection
for me here.

219
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:40,749
You wouldn't think
I'd want that, would you?

220
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:49,734
Henry?
Hmm?

221
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:51,760
I have a confession.
Yeah?

222
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:56,741
- I don't much like
our children.

223
00:25:56,776 --> 00:26:01,714
Only you... the child I raised but
didn't bear. You never cared for me.

224
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:04,706
I did and do, believe me.
Henry's bed is Henry's province.

225
00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:08,721
He can people it with sheep
for all I care,

226
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:10,688
which, on occasion,
he has done.

227
00:26:10,723 --> 00:26:13,691
Rosamund's been dead
for seven years.

228
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:17,526
Two months and 18 days.
I never liked her much.

229
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,722
- You count the days?
- I made the numbers up.

230
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,568
He found miss clifford
in the mists of wales...

231
00:26:23,736 --> 00:26:25,703
and brought her home
for closer observation.

232
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:29,175
Liking what he found,
he scrutinized her many years.

233
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,577
He loved her deeply, and
she, him. And yet, my dear,

234
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:36,749
when Henry had to choose
between his lady and my lands...

235
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:41,654
there is no sport in
hurting me. It's so easy.

236
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:44,622
After all the years
of loving care,

237
00:26:44,657 --> 00:26:47,649
do you think I could
bring myself to hurt you?

238
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,752
Eleanor, with both hands
tied behind you.

239
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,761
She is lovely, isn't she?

240
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:05,701
Yes, very.

241
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:09,715
Who could I have chosen
to love...

242
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,682
to gall you more?

243
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:14,685
There's no one.

244
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,687
Time hasn't done a thing
but wrinkle you.

245
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:19,725
It hasn't even done that. I've
borne six girls, five boys...

246
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,716
and 31 connubial years of you.

247
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:26,231
How am I possible? There
are moments when I miss you.

248
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:29,735
Many? That's my wooly
sheepdog. Do you doubt it?

249
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,703
So, wee Johnny gets the crown.

250
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:35,240
I've heard it rumored,
but I don't believe it.

251
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:38,505
Losing Alais will be hard,
for you do love her.

252
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,736
It's an old man's last
attachment, nothing more.

253
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,719
How hard do you find
living in your castle?

254
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:52,257
It was difficult in the
beginning, but that's past.

255
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:55,761
I find I've seen
the world enough.

256
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:57,752
I'll never let you loose.

257
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,665
You led too many
civil wars against me.

258
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,705
And I damn near won the last one.
Still, as long as I get trotted out...

259
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,697
for Christmas courts and
state occasions now and then...

260
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,713
for I do like to see you...

261
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:15,704
it's enough.

262
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:20,720
I'm famished.
Let's go in to dinner.

263
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:23,712
Arm in arm.
And hand in hand.

264
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:29,729
You're still
a marvel of a man.

265
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:31,720
And you're my lady.

266
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:45,710
It's an odd thing, Eleanor.

267
00:28:45,745 --> 00:28:48,713
I've fought and bargained
all these years...

268
00:28:48,748 --> 00:28:53,753
as if the only thing I had to live
for was what happened after I was dead.

269
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:55,755
I've something else
to live for now.

270
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,747
I've blundered onto peace.

271
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,659
On Christmas eve.

272
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:06,699
Since Louis died, while Philip
grew, I've had no France to fight.

273
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:09,691
In that lull, I've found how
good it is to write a law...

274
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:13,695
or make a tax more fair
or sit in judgment to decide...

275
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:16,698
which peasant gets a cow.

276
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,708
I tell you, there is nothing
more important in the world.

277
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:25,707
Now the french boy's big enough,
and I'm sick of war.

278
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:34,692
Do you still need
the vexin, Henry?

279
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:37,730
It's as vital as it ever was. My troops
there are one day away from paris.

280
00:29:37,765 --> 00:29:40,733
That's a march of 20 miles.
I must keep it.

281
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:43,701
Henry, dear,

282
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:47,740
if Alais does not marry Richard,
I will see you lose the vexin.

283
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:50,743
Well, I thought
you'd never say it.

284
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:53,763
I can do it.

285
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:56,714
You can try.

286
00:29:56,749 --> 00:30:00,753
We have a pack of barons we
should look the loving couple for.

287
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:03,745
Can you read love in that?

288
00:30:04,757 --> 00:30:07,749
And permanent affection.

289
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:30,748
My Richard is the next king,
not your John.

290
00:30:30,783 --> 00:30:33,786
I know you, Henry. I know
every twist and bend you've got,

291
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:36,789
and I'll be waiting
round each corner for you.

292
00:30:36,824 --> 00:30:39,325
Do you truly care
who's king?

293
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,792
I care because
you care so much.

294
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:46,799
Don't fight me, Eleanor. What would you
have me do... give out, give up, give in?

295
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:49,767
Give me a little peace.
A little?

296
00:30:49,802 --> 00:30:54,807
Why so modest? How about eternal
peace? Now, there's a thought.

297
00:30:54,842 --> 00:30:59,835
If you oppose me,
I'll strike you any way I can.

298
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,728
Henry?
Madam?

299
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:20,766
Did you ever love me?

300
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:22,757
No.

301
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:27,762
Good. That will
make this pleasanter.

302
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:42,773
Well, I've come.
I'm here.

303
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:47,184
What was it you wanted?
Just to talk.

304
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:50,222
We haven't been alone,
the two of us, in...

305
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:53,248
how long is it, lamb...
two years?

306
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:55,760
You look fit.
War agrees with you.

307
00:32:55,795 --> 00:32:59,799
I keep informed. I follow all
your slaughters from a distance.

308
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:01,699
Do sit down.

309
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:05,226
Is this an audience, a good-night
hug with kisses or an ambush?

310
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:08,490
Let's hope it's a reunion.

311
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:10,708
Must you look so stern?

312
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:13,279
I sent for you to say
I want your love again,

313
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,713
but I can't say it
to a face like that.

314
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:18,740
My love, of all things.
What would you want it for?

315
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:22,755
Why, for itself. What
other purpose could I have?

316
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,275
You will tell me
when you're ready to.

317
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,761
I scheme a lot, I know.
I plot and plan.

318
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:34,366
That's how a queen
in prison spends her time.

319
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:36,734
But there is more to me
than that.

320
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:40,364
Can't I say I love a son
and be believed?

321
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,377
If I were you,
I'd try another tack.

322
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:50,416
I've no dammed up floods of passion for
you. There's no chance I'll overflow.

323
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:54,785
You're a dull boy, dull as plainsong.
La-la-la, forever on one note.

324
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,458
I gave the church up out of
boredom. I can do as much for you.

325
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:02,693
You'll never give me up,
not while I hold the Aquitaine.

326
00:34:02,728 --> 00:34:07,722
You think I'm motivated by love of hills
and dales? I think you want it back.

327
00:34:08,434 --> 00:34:11,737
You're so deceitful, you can't
ask for water when you're thirsty.

328
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:15,741
We could tangle spiders
in the webs you weave.

329
00:34:15,776 --> 00:34:18,639
If I'm so devious,
why don't you go?

330
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:21,503
Don't stand there
qulvering in limbo.

331
00:34:21,747 --> 00:34:25,513
Love me, little lamb,
or leave me.

332
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:29,149
Leave you, madam?

333
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:31,546
With pure joy.

334
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:38,564
Departure's a simple act. You put the
left foot down, and then the right.

335
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,555
Mother! Hush, dear. Mother's fighting.

336
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:44,603
Father's finished working out
the treaty terms.

337
00:34:44,638 --> 00:34:48,596
How nice.
Where is your father?

338
00:34:51,777 --> 00:34:53,744
Ah, there you are.

339
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:55,746
Well, have you
put the terms to Philip?

340
00:34:55,781 --> 00:34:59,774
Not yet, but we're shortly granting him
an audience. I hope you'll all attend.

341
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,688
Are we to know the terms,
or would you rather tease us?

342
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:08,226
Not at all. The terms are... what are
you giving to Philip, what of mine?

343
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:11,730
Whatever you've got goes to me. And
what's the nothing Geoffrey gets?

344
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:14,750
My God, boys,
you can't all three be king.

345
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:17,736
All three of us can try.
That's pointless now.

346
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:20,704
I want you to succeed me,
Richard.

347
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:23,731
Alais and the crown...
I give you both.

348
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:26,745
I've no sense of humor.
If I did, I'd laugh.

349
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,714
- I mean to do it.
- What about me?

350
00:35:30,749 --> 00:35:32,745
I'm your favorite.
I'm the one you love.

351
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,742
I'm sorry, John.
I can't help myself.

352
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,757
Could you keep anything I gave you?
Could you beat him in the field?

353
00:35:38,792 --> 00:35:40,748
You could.
John, I won't be there.

354
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:44,763
I'm losing too.
All my dreams for you are lost.

355
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:46,730
You've led me on.
I never meant to.

356
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:49,768
You're a failure as a father.
You know that? I'm sorry, Johnny.

357
00:35:49,803 --> 00:35:52,771
Not yet, but I'll do something
terrible, and you'll be sorry then.

358
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:57,776
Did you rehearse all this,
or are you improvising?

359
00:35:57,811 --> 00:35:59,761
Good God, woman,
face the facts.

360
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:01,712
Which ones?
We have so many.

361
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,682
Power is the only fact.

362
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:07,685
How could I keep him
from the throne?

363
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,722
He'd only take it
if I didn't give it to him.

364
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:11,689
No, you'd make me
fight for it.

365
00:36:11,724 --> 00:36:14,727
I know you. You'd never give me
anything. True, and I haven't.

366
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:17,730
You get Alais and the kingdom,
but I get the thing I want most:

367
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:20,722
If you're king, England
stays intact. I get that.

368
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,737
It's all yours now... the crown,
the girl, the whole black business.

369
00:36:24,772 --> 00:36:26,728
Isn't that enough?

370
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:31,709
I don't know
who's to be congratulated.

371
00:36:31,744 --> 00:36:35,748
Kings, Queens, knights everywhere
you look, and I'm the only pawn.

372
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:40,742
I haven't got a thing to lose.
That makes me dangerous.

373
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:44,722
- Poor child.
- Poor John.

374
00:36:44,757 --> 00:36:49,727
Who says, "poor John"?
Don't everybody sob at once.

375
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:51,753
My God, if I went up in flames,
there's not a living soul...

376
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:54,767
who'd pee on me
to put the fire out.

377
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:58,736
Let's strike a flint and see.

378
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:02,235
You're everything a little
brother dreams of, you know that?

379
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,700
- I used to dream about you all the time.
- Ah, Johnny.

380
00:37:06,712 --> 00:37:10,705
I'll show you, Eleanor.
I've not lost yet.

381
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:20,715
Well, mummy,
if you want me, here I am.

382
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:27,733
John's lost his chancellor,
has he? And you've gained one.

383
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:31,702
It's a bitter thing
your mummy has to say.

384
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:35,741
She doesn't trust me. You must
know Henry isn't through with John.

385
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:39,710
He'll keep the vexin till
the moon goes blue from cold.

386
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:43,749
And as for Richard's wedding day...
we'll see the second coming first.

387
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:46,752
The needlework alone can
last for years.

388
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:48,719
I know.

389
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:50,721
You know I know.

390
00:37:50,756 --> 00:37:53,724
I know you know I know.

391
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:58,764
We know Henry knows,
and Henry knows we know it.

392
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:00,664
We're a knowledgeable family.

393
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:03,691
Will Richard take me
for his chancellor or won't he?

394
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:07,671
Why are you dropping John?

395
00:38:07,706 --> 00:38:12,711
Because you're going to win. You will,
with me to help you. I haven't yet.

396
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:15,679
I can handle John. He'll
swallow anything I tell him.

397
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:18,717
I'll take him by the hand and
walk him into the trap you set.

398
00:38:18,752 --> 00:38:20,684
You're good.
You're first class, Geoff.

399
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,687
You'd sell John out to me,
or me to John, or...

400
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:28,727
you can tell me... have you found some
way of selling everyone to everybody?

401
00:38:28,762 --> 00:38:30,752
Not yet, mummy,
but I'm working on it.

402
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,699
I don't care who's king,
but you and Henry do.

403
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:38,760
I want to watch the two of you
go picnicking on one another.

404
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:42,706
You have a gift for hating.

405
00:38:42,741 --> 00:38:45,733
You're the expert.
You should know.

406
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:48,712
Dear lord.

407
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:51,715
You've loved me
all these years.

408
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:56,855
Oh, God forgive me. I've upset
the queen. We need you. Help us.

409
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,857
What... and miss the fun
of selling you?

410
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:01,690
Be Richard's chancellor.

411
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:06,687
Rot.

412
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:15,696
Well, that's how
deals are made.

413
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:19,307
We've got him
if we want him.

414
00:39:19,342 --> 00:39:21,906
He'll sell us all,
you know,

415
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:24,909
but only if he thinks
we think he won't.

416
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:30,722
Why did I have to have
such clever children?

417
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:39,731
What's the matter, Richard? Nothing.

418
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,699
It's a heavy thing,
your nothing.

419
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:45,737
When I write or send for you
or speak or reach,

420
00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:49,741
your nothings come,
like stones.

421
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:52,009
Don't play a scene with me.

422
00:39:52,044 --> 00:39:55,741
I wouldn't if I could.
I'm simpler than I used to be.

423
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,743
I had, at one time,
many appetites.

424
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:01,747
I wanted poetry and power and the
young men who create them both.

425
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:05,079
I even wanted Henry, too,
in those days.

426
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:09,726
Now I've only one desire left...
to see you king.

427
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:12,764
The only thing you want to see is
father's vitals on a bed of lettuce.

428
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:15,767
You don't care who wins, as long
as Henry loses. You'd do anything.

429
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:17,734
You are Medea to the teeth,

430
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:21,762
only this is one son you won't use
for vengeance against your husband.

431
00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:25,766
How my captivity has
changed you.

432
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:31,775
Henry meant to hurt me.
He's hacked you up instead.

433
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:37,211
Men coveted this talon once.

434
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:41,225
Henry was 18 when we met,
and I was queen of France.

435
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,796
He came down from the north to
Paris with a mind like Aristotle's...

436
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:48,765
and a form like mortal sin.

437
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,269
We shattered the commandments
on the spot.

438
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:56,308
I spent three months annulling
Louis, then in may, in spring,

439
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:59,044
not far from here,
we married...

440
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:01,745
young count Henry
and his countess.

441
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:07,753
But in three years' time I was his
queen, and he was king of England.

442
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:13,724
Done at 21... five years
your junior, general.

443
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:18,764
I can count. There was no Thomas
Beckett then, or Rosamund...

444
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:22,332
no rivals, only me.

445
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:26,571
And then young Henry came,
and you...

446
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:30,741
and all the other blossoms
in my garden.

447
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:35,781
Yes. Had I been sterile,
darling, I'd be happier today.

448
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:38,409
Is that designed to hurt me?
What a waste.

449
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:41,446
I've fought with Henry over who
comes next, whose dawn it is...

450
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:44,779
and which son gets the sunset,
and we'll never live to see it.

451
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:48,449
Look at you.

452
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:51,762
I loved you more than Henry,

453
00:41:51,797 --> 00:41:54,493
and it's cost me everything.
What do you want?

454
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:59,805
I want us back the way we
were. No, that's not it.

455
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,740
All right, then.
I want the Aquitaine.

456
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:07,711
That's the mother I remember.
We can win. I can get you Alais.

457
00:42:07,746 --> 00:42:11,516
I can make the marriage happen, but
I've got to have the Aquitaine to do it.

458
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:14,417
I must have it back. It's
mine, and I'll never give it up.

459
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:18,488
Shall I write my will,
"to Richard... everything"?

460
00:42:18,523 --> 00:42:22,550
Would you believe me then?
Where's paper? Paper burns.

461
00:42:24,763 --> 00:42:26,730
I love you.

462
00:42:26,765 --> 00:42:29,433
You love nothing.

463
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:33,461
You're incomplete. The human
parts of you are missing.

464
00:42:33,772 --> 00:42:37,509
You're as dead
as you are deadly.

465
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:39,773
Don't leave me.

466
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:45,645
You were lovely once.

467
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,775
I've seen the pictures.

468
00:42:48,553 --> 00:42:51,386
Don't you remember
how you loved me?

469
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:54,758
We were always hand in hand.

470
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:59,161
Here's how it felt.
As hot and coarse as that?

471
00:42:59,196 --> 00:43:03,530
This won't burn.
I'll scratch a will on this.

472
00:43:03,735 --> 00:43:05,737
"To Richard... everything. "

473
00:43:05,772 --> 00:43:07,728
Mother!

474
00:43:10,742 --> 00:43:13,578
Remember how I
taught you numbers...

475
00:43:13,613 --> 00:43:16,615
and the lute and poetry?

476
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,583
See? You do remember.

477
00:43:19,618 --> 00:43:22,719
I taught you dancing, too,
and languages...

478
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:26,747
and all the music I knew and
how to love what's beautiful.

479
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:32,756
The sun was warmer then,
and we were every day together.

480
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:05,730
William, tell the french king
I'll see him in the parlor.

481
00:44:05,765 --> 00:44:07,721
Yes, my lord.
In half an hour.

482
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:10,724
Half an hour. Good.

483
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:20,734
Of course, you know there's not
a word of truth to Henry's terms.

484
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:23,748
If that's a warning,
thank you.

485
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:26,740
What if it's an offer?

486
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:30,249
"What if" is
a game for scholars.

487
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:32,746
What if angels
sat on pinheads?

488
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,257
What if I were king?

489
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:40,754
It's your game, Geoff.

490
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:43,757
You play it.

491
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:00,717
John.

492
00:45:03,722 --> 00:45:06,690
I made this for father.
All the pieces work.

493
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:09,728
It took months. I'm not a fool.
I know. Now, here's my plan.

494
00:45:09,763 --> 00:45:13,732
I read three languages.
I've studied law.

495
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:15,699
What plan?

496
00:45:15,734 --> 00:45:17,725
We've got to make a
deal with Philip. Why?

497
00:45:18,737 --> 00:45:21,705
Because you're out, and Richard's
in. And what kind of deal?

498
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,745
A war. If we three join and fight
now, we can finish Richard off.

499
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,737
You mean destroy him?
Hmm.

500
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:32,751
And mother too?

501
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:34,718
And mother too.

502
00:45:34,753 --> 00:45:38,256
Now, do we do it? Is it
on? I've got to think.

503
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:41,760
You haven't time.
We are extra princes now.

504
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:43,751
You know where
extra princes go?

505
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:48,756
Down.

506
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:53,761
Well, does John want a war
or doesn't he?

507
00:45:54,773 --> 00:45:57,776
Do you? If John asks for your
soldiers, will he get them?

508
00:45:57,811 --> 00:46:00,677
If John wants a war,
he's got one.

509
00:46:00,712 --> 00:46:03,680
John, you hear that?
I'm still thinking.

510
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:07,708
Let me help. It's either
Richard on the throne or you.

511
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:12,713
Do you think we'd win?

512
00:46:14,726 --> 00:46:16,717
I know it.

513
00:46:30,742 --> 00:46:33,734
Henry!

514
00:46:34,412 --> 00:46:39,083
But you don't understand. I would
appreciate a little qulet confidence.

515
00:46:39,118 --> 00:46:43,755
I've enough nits picking at me.
But you've promised me to Richard!

516
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,723
Good God,
you don't think I meant it?

517
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:49,726
So that whole scene,
all you said to John...

518
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:53,765
you think I'd ever give him up when I've
mothered him and fathered him and babied him?

519
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,769
He's all I've got! How often do you
people have to hear it... every supper?

520
00:46:57,804 --> 00:46:59,771
Should we start the soup with
who we love and who we don't?

521
00:46:59,806 --> 00:47:01,705
I think you like passing me
from hand to hand.

522
00:47:02,707 --> 00:47:04,709
What am I to you...
a collection plate?

523
00:47:04,744 --> 00:47:06,676
Or am I all you've got,
like John?

524
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:09,679
I've got to get
the Aquitaine for John.

525
00:47:09,714 --> 00:47:14,684
- I talk people, and you answer back in provinces!
- They get mixed up.

526
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,710
What's the Aquitaine to Eleanor? It's
not a province. It's a way to torture me.

527
00:47:17,722 --> 00:47:21,225
That's why she spent the evening
wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.

528
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,729
She'll squeeze it out of him. My
God, I'd have loved to eavesdrop.

529
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:28,756
"I taught you prancing, lamb,
and lute and flute... "

530
00:47:29,734 --> 00:47:32,760
That's marvelous.

531
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:34,796
It's absolutely me.

532
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,743
I thought as long as I was
coming down, I'd bring them.

533
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:40,777
Whatever are you giving me?

534
00:47:40,812 --> 00:47:42,803
You're such a child.
You always ask.

535
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:45,750
"To Henry. "

536
00:47:45,785 --> 00:47:47,717
Heavy.

537
00:47:47,752 --> 00:47:50,755
It's my tombstone!
Eleanor, you spoil me.

538
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,746
I never could
deny you anything.

539
00:47:52,857 --> 00:47:57,344
Don't go. It nettles her
to see how much I need you.

540
00:47:57,379 --> 00:48:01,832
You need me, Henry, like a
tailor needs a tinker's dam.

541
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:05,669
Oh, I know that look.

542
00:48:05,704 --> 00:48:07,706
He's going to say
he loves me.

543
00:48:07,741 --> 00:48:09,867
Like my life.

544
00:48:14,713 --> 00:48:17,681
I talk that way
to keep her spirits up.

545
00:48:17,716 --> 00:48:21,720
Well, how'd you do with
Richard? Did you break his heart?

546
00:48:21,755 --> 00:48:24,688
You think he ought to
give me back the Aquitaine?

547
00:48:24,723 --> 00:48:27,954
I can't see why he shouldn't. After
all, I've promised him the throne.

548
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:32,929
The boy keeps wondering
if your promises are any good.

549
00:48:32,964 --> 00:48:37,001
There's no sense asking if the air's
good when there's nothing else to breathe.

550
00:48:37,036 --> 00:48:39,731
Exactly what I told him.

551
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:44,743
Have you got it?
Will he give it back?

552
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:47,735
No Aquitaine for John.

553
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:58,722
I have to give him something.
Isn't some agreement possible?

554
00:48:58,757 --> 00:49:03,027
Love, in a world where carpenters
get resurrected, anything is possible.

555
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:06,381
You bore him, damn it.
He's your son!

556
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:09,701
Oh, heavens, yes.
280 days I bore him.

557
00:49:09,736 --> 00:49:12,035
I recall them all.

558
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,671
You'd only just found Rosamund.

559
00:49:14,706 --> 00:49:18,699
Why her so damn particularly?
I've found other women.

560
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:22,102
Countless others.

561
00:49:22,714 --> 00:49:24,113
What's your count?

562
00:49:24,716 --> 00:49:28,152
Let's have a tally of the
bedspreads you've spread out on.

563
00:49:30,722 --> 00:49:33,714
Thomas Beckett's.
That's a lie.

564
00:49:34,726 --> 00:49:40,163
I know.
You still care what I do.

565
00:49:40,198 --> 00:49:43,201
I want the Aquitaine for John!
I want it, and I'll have it.

566
00:49:43,236 --> 00:49:46,227
Is that menace you're
conveying? Is it to be torture?

567
00:49:46,738 --> 00:49:50,742
Will you boil me or stretch me...
which? Or am I to be perforated?

568
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:53,209
I have the documents,
and you will sign.

569
00:49:53,244 --> 00:49:57,282
How will you force me to... threats?
"Sign or I refuse to feed you. "

570
00:49:57,317 --> 00:50:02,719
Tears? "Oh, sign before
my heart goes crack. "

571
00:50:02,754 --> 00:50:06,747
I'm like the earth, old man...
there isn't any way around me.

572
00:50:07,325 --> 00:50:08,758
I adore you.

573
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:12,319
Save your aching arches.
That road's closed.

574
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:15,767
I have an offer for you,
my dear.

575
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:18,334
A deal? A deal?

576
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:23,363
I give the richest province on
the continent to John for what?

577
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:27,404
You tell me,
mastermind, for what.

578
00:50:30,782 --> 00:50:32,773
Your freedom.

579
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:41,789
Oh.

580
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,792
Once Johnny gets the Aquitaine,
you're free. I'll let you out.

581
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:48,765
Think: On the loose in london,
winters in provence,

582
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,792
impromptu trips to visit Richard
anywhere he's killing people...

583
00:50:52,804 --> 00:50:56,773
all that for a signature.

584
00:50:56,808 --> 00:51:01,746
- You're good.
- I thought it might appeal. You always fancied traveling.

585
00:51:01,781 --> 00:51:03,713
Yes.

586
00:51:03,748 --> 00:51:07,752
I even made poor Louis
take me on crusade.

587
00:51:07,787 --> 00:51:10,486
How's that for blasphemy?

588
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:15,760
I dressed my maids as amazons and
rode bare-breasted halfway to damascus.

589
00:51:15,795 --> 00:51:18,752
Louls had a seizure, and I
damn near died of windburn,

590
00:51:23,768 --> 00:51:26,601
but the troops were dazzled.

591
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:33,770
Henry, I'm against the wall.

592
00:51:36,648 --> 00:51:38,639
To be a prisoner...

593
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:41,778
to be bricked in...

594
00:51:42,787 --> 00:51:44,778
when you've known the world...

595
00:51:47,692 --> 00:51:50,786
I'll never know how I survived.

596
00:51:52,697 --> 00:51:57,725
These ten years, Henry,
have been unimaginable.

597
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:01,738
And now,

598
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:07,745
you offer me
the only thing I want...

599
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,680
if I give up...

600
00:52:10,715 --> 00:52:12,740
the only thing I treasure.

601
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,720
Sign the paper, and we'll
break the happy news.

602
00:52:17,755 --> 00:52:21,759
The queen is free, John gets the
Aquitaine, and Richard marries Alais.

603
00:52:21,794 --> 00:52:25,763
Yes, let's have it done.

604
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:27,754
I'll sign.

605
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:32,735
On one condition.
Name it.

606
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:36,739
Have the wedding now.
What's that?

607
00:52:36,774 --> 00:52:40,743
Why, I've surprised you.
Surely it's not sudden.

608
00:52:40,778 --> 00:52:44,782
They've been marching down the aisle
for 16 years, and that's a long walk.

609
00:52:44,817 --> 00:52:48,751
John can be best man.
That's a laugh.

610
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:52,790
And you can give the bride
away. I want to watch you do it.

611
00:52:52,825 --> 00:52:57,760
Alais...
I can live without her.

612
00:52:57,795 --> 00:52:59,762
And I thought you loved her. So I do.

613
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:03,735
Thank God. You frightened me.
I was afraid this wouldn't hurt.

614
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,727
What a tragedy you are.

615
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,734
I wonder...
do you ever wonder...

616
00:53:14,746 --> 00:53:17,738
if I slept
with your father?

617
00:53:21,753 --> 00:53:25,251
My father?
It's a lie.

618
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,749
But there are rumors.

619
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:31,728
Don't you ever wonder?

620
00:53:31,763 --> 00:53:34,755
Is it rich, despising
me? Is it rewarding? No.

621
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,734
Then stop!
How?

622
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:39,760
It's what I live for.
I'll show you.

623
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:42,739
By christ, I will.
I'll do it.

624
00:53:42,774 --> 00:53:46,505
Where's a priest?
Somebody dig me up a priest!

625
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:50,747
You!
Fetch me a bishop!

626
00:53:50,782 --> 00:53:53,750
Get old Durham.
He's just down the hall.

627
00:53:53,785 --> 00:53:57,778
Ask him to meet us in the
chapel. John, Richard, Geoffrey!

628
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:33,758
What's wrong? What's happened?
Richard's getting married.

629
00:54:33,793 --> 00:54:38,728
Getting married? Now?
He's getting married now?

630
00:54:38,763 --> 00:54:40,765
I never cease to marvel at
the qulckness of your mind.

631
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,733
You can't hurt me,
you bag of bile.

632
00:54:43,768 --> 00:54:45,735
But you can, father.
Why? Because I say so.

633
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:49,774
My lord, the bishop's waiting in the
chapel. Good. Let's get this over with.

634
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:52,742
You'll make a lovely bride.
I wonder if I'll cry.

635
00:54:52,777 --> 00:54:55,745
You sound as if you think
it's going to happen. I do.

636
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,771
He's only plotting. Can't you
tell when Henry's plotting?

637
00:54:58,783 --> 00:55:00,751
Not this time.
He'll never give me up.

638
00:55:00,786 --> 00:55:02,685
You think I won't?
Because you told me so.

639
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,723
You're not my helen. I won't fight
a war to save a face. We're done.

640
00:55:05,758 --> 00:55:08,715
I don't believe you!
Wait ten minutes!

641
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:15,733
Please! Richard, Richard,
we're not...

642
00:55:15,768 --> 00:55:17,735
honestly, we're not!

643
00:55:20,738 --> 00:55:23,730
Please!
We love each other.

644
00:55:26,744 --> 00:55:31,738
Come on! It's lunacy!
I won't do it! I won't!

645
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,743
- Lunacy! Let me go, Henry. Richard, no!
- Come on!

646
00:55:37,555 --> 00:55:39,757
I won't say the words!
Not one of them!

647
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:42,777
It makes no sense!
Why give me up?

648
00:55:42,812 --> 00:55:45,763
What do you get?
What are you gaining?

649
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:48,799
Why, the Aquitaine,
of course.

650
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:50,766
What's that again?

651
00:55:50,801 --> 00:55:53,771
Your mother gets her freedom,
and I get the Aquitaine.

652
00:55:53,806 --> 00:55:55,771
That is the proposition,
isn't it? You did agree.

653
00:55:55,806 --> 00:55:58,832
Of course she did. I knew it. It
was all pretense. I believed it all.

654
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:02,713
I meant it all. No wedding.
There'll be no wedding.

655
00:56:02,748 --> 00:56:05,681
But, my boy, look.
Durham's waiting.

656
00:56:05,716 --> 00:56:08,769
Marry her, for my sake. It
isn't much to ask. Never!

657
00:56:08,804 --> 00:56:11,787
But I promised it to Philip.
Think of my position.

658
00:56:11,822 --> 00:56:14,814
Damn the wedding and to hell with
your position. You don't dare defy me.

659
00:56:15,726 --> 00:56:17,717
Don't I?

660
00:56:17,862 --> 00:56:21,732
You're the king of France, for
God's sake. Speak up. Do something.

661
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:23,859
Make a threat. Come on,
frighten me. Am I? Dunce!

662
00:56:24,435 --> 00:56:27,703
He never meant
to have the wedding.

663
00:56:27,738 --> 00:56:31,742
Come again. You're good at
rage. I like the way you play it.

664
00:56:31,777 --> 00:56:34,734
Boy, don't ever call a king
a liar to his face.

665
00:56:34,912 --> 00:56:38,915
I'm not a boy...
to you or anyone!

666
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,748
Boy, you came here asking
for a wedding or the vexin back.

667
00:56:41,953 --> 00:56:45,946
By God, you don't get either. It's no
to both. You have a pact with France!

668
00:56:46,357 --> 00:56:49,760
Then damn the pact and damn France.
She never marries, not while I'm alive.

669
00:56:49,795 --> 00:56:52,728
Your life and never
are two different times.

670
00:56:52,763 --> 00:56:57,733
Not on my clock, boy!
Listen to the lion!

671
00:56:57,768 --> 00:57:01,706
Come on, frighten me. Don't spoil it,
Richard. Take it like a good sport.

672
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:03,673
How's your bad leg?
Better, thank you.

673
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:06,978
Your bad back? You're getting
old. You'll have me once too often.

674
00:57:07,013 --> 00:57:10,715
When? I'm 50 now. My God,
boy, I'm the oldest man I know.

675
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,706
I've got a decade
on the pope.

676
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,021
What's it to be? The
broadsword when I'm 85?

677
00:57:19,056 --> 00:57:22,727
I'm not a second son now. Your
Henry's lies in the vault, you know.

678
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:26,696
I know.
I've seen him there.

679
00:57:26,731 --> 00:57:29,100
I'll have the crown. You'll
have what daddy gives you.

680
00:57:29,135 --> 00:57:32,702
I am next in line!
To nothing!

681
00:57:32,737 --> 00:57:34,739
Then we'll only have the
broadswords now. This minute?

682
00:57:34,774 --> 00:57:36,706
No, on the battlefield!
So we're at war?

683
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:39,442
Yes, we're at war. I have 2,000
men at poitiers. Can they hear you?

684
00:57:39,477 --> 00:57:42,144
Call and see who answers. You're
as close to poitiers as you'll get.

685
00:57:42,747 --> 00:57:47,251
You don't dare hold me prisoner. Until we're
all agreed John comes next, I can and will.

686
00:57:47,286 --> 00:57:51,756
You're a king's son, so I treat you with
respect. You have the freedom of the castle.

687
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,190
The castle doesn't stand that
holds me. Post your guards.

688
00:57:56,193 --> 00:57:59,754
My God, I'm king again.
Fantastic.

689
00:57:59,997 --> 00:58:03,694
Are you happy for me, Geoff?
I'm happy for us both.

690
00:58:16,514 --> 00:58:19,244
You played it nicely.
You were good.

691
00:58:19,717 --> 00:58:24,505
Yes, I was.
I fooled you, didn't I?

692
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:29,293
Oh, God, but I do love
being king.

693
00:58:29,328 --> 00:58:31,284
Well, Henry,

694
00:58:31,729 --> 00:58:34,509
liege and lord,

695
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,290
what happens now?

696
00:58:37,735 --> 00:58:39,327
I've no idea.

697
00:58:39,737 --> 00:58:43,730
I know I'm winning, and I know I'll
win, but what the next move is...

698
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:50,745
you were scared,
weren't you?

699
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:54,749
No.

700
00:58:57,388 --> 00:58:58,753
I think you were.

701
00:58:59,423 --> 00:59:04,360
I was. You mustn't play with
feelings, Henry. Not with mine.

702
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:09,365
It wasn't possible
to lose you.

703
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,698
I must hold you dearer
than I thought.

704
00:59:14,705 --> 00:59:19,699
You've got your enigmatic face
on. What's your mood, I wonder?

705
00:59:21,445 --> 00:59:23,679
Pure delight.

706
00:59:23,714 --> 00:59:27,707
I'm locked up
with my sons.

707
00:59:28,486 --> 00:59:31,478
What mother does not
dream of that?

708
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:40,724
One thing.
Yes?

709
00:59:41,732 --> 00:59:44,530
May I watch you kiss her?

710
00:59:44,735 --> 00:59:47,653
Can't you ever stop?

711
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:50,571
I watch you every night.

712
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:53,733
I conjure it
before I sleep.

713
00:59:54,578 --> 00:59:56,712
Leave it there.

714
00:59:56,747 --> 01:00:00,178
My curiosity
is intellectual.

715
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:03,610
I want to see
how accurate I am.

716
01:00:07,758 --> 01:00:11,660
Forget the dragon
in the doorway. Come.

717
01:00:14,765 --> 01:00:17,666
Believe I love you,
for I do.

718
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:21,694
Believe I'm yours forever,
for I am.

719
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:27,710
Believe in my contentment
and the joy you give me.

720
01:00:28,779 --> 01:00:30,770
And believe...

721
01:00:35,753 --> 01:00:37,778
you want more?

722
01:00:43,794 --> 01:00:47,787
I'm an old man
in an empty place.

723
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,791
Be with me.

724
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:47,780
How beautiful you make me.

725
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:56,790
What might solomon have sung
had he seen this.

726
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,703
I can't.

727
01:02:00,738 --> 01:02:02,729
I'd turn to salt.

728
01:02:05,743 --> 01:02:07,734
I've lost again.

729
01:02:09,747 --> 01:02:12,739
I'm done for this time.

730
01:02:14,752 --> 01:02:20,748
Well, there'll be
other Christmases.

731
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,753
I'd hang you from the nipples,
but you'd shock the children.

732
01:02:33,771 --> 01:02:36,763
They kissed sweetly,
didn't they?

733
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:43,874
I'll have him next time.
I can wait.

734
01:02:43,909 --> 01:02:46,866
Ah, there you are!

735
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:52,872
My comfort
and my company.

736
01:02:54,885 --> 01:02:57,877
We're locked in
for another year.

737
01:03:00,824 --> 01:03:02,815
Four seasons more.

738
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:07,820
What a desolation.

739
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:13,826
What a life's work.

740
01:03:20,644 --> 01:03:22,811
Is it too much?

741
01:03:22,846 --> 01:03:25,849
Be sure to squlnt
as you approach.

742
01:03:25,884 --> 01:03:28,852
You may be blinded
by my beauty.

743
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:31,820
Merry Christmas.

744
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:34,858
Is that why you're here...
to tell me that?

745
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:37,861
I thought
you might be lonely.

746
01:03:37,896 --> 01:03:40,375
Here, chancellor.

747
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,855
Try it on for size.

748
01:03:43,867 --> 01:03:45,834
It's puzzling.

749
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:48,837
I remember my third birthday.

750
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:51,869
Not just pictures
of the garden or the gifts,

751
01:03:51,904 --> 01:03:54,867
but who did what to whom
and how it felt.

752
01:03:55,879 --> 01:03:57,881
My memory stretches that far back,
but never once can I remember...

753
01:03:57,916 --> 01:04:00,817
anything from you or father
warmer than indifference.

754
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:02,808
Why is that?

755
01:04:04,821 --> 01:04:07,789
I don't know.

756
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:11,851
That was not an easy question from me,
and I don't deserve and easy answer.

757
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:18,902
There are times I think we
loved none of our children.

758
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:21,870
Still too easy,
don't you think?

759
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:25,842
I'm weary, and you want
a simple answer,

760
01:04:25,877 --> 01:04:27,876
and I haven't one.

761
01:04:27,911 --> 01:04:31,847
I'm so sick
of all of you.

762
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:34,816
I thought I'd come
and gloat a little.

763
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:37,854
Mother's tired. Come stick
pins tomorrow morning.

764
01:04:37,889 --> 01:04:39,821
I'll be
more responsive then.

765
01:04:39,856 --> 01:04:42,984
It's no fun goading anyone
tonight. Bastard's boxed us up.

766
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,997
What's that, dear? We're his
prisoners, if that interests you.

767
01:04:47,032 --> 01:04:49,864
Why should it?
I'm his prisoner anyway?

768
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:52,000
It was... correct me
if I'm wrong...

769
01:04:52,035 --> 01:04:55,027
but it was my impression that
you wanted Henry's throne for me.

770
01:04:55,872 --> 01:04:59,075
We can't win, Richard.
We've lost it this time.

771
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,777
You think I'm finished, do you? So I do.

772
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:04,007
I've suffered more defeats
than you have teeth.

773
01:05:04,815 --> 01:05:06,782
I know one
when it happens to me.

774
01:05:06,817 --> 01:05:10,048
Take your wormwood like a good
boy. Swallow it and go to bed.

775
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:13,056
I will be king. So you
will, but not this year!

776
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:17,049
Oh, leave it, Richard!
Let it go for now.

777
01:05:17,828 --> 01:05:19,795
I can't.
It's not so hard.

778
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:23,095
Try saying after me:
John wins, I lose.

779
01:05:24,835 --> 01:05:26,802
And what if John died?

780
01:05:26,837 --> 01:05:29,135
You wouldn't dare! A
knife. Why wouldn't I?

781
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,842
He's got a knife! Of course he
has a knife. He always has a knife.

782
01:05:31,877 --> 01:05:35,110
We all have knives. It's
1183, and we're barbarians.

783
01:05:35,145 --> 01:05:40,816
How clear we make it. Oh, my
piglets, we are the origins of war.

784
01:05:40,851 --> 01:05:44,187
Not history's forces, nor the times,
nor justice, nor the lack of it,

785
01:05:44,222 --> 01:05:47,155
nor causes, nor religions,
nor ideas,

786
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:50,057
nor kinds of government,
nor any other thing.

787
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:53,280
Weare the killers.
Webreed wars.

788
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:56,198
We carry it,
like syphilis, inside.

789
01:05:56,233 --> 01:05:59,870
Dead bodies rot in field and stream
because the living ones are rotten.

790
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:02,805
For the love of God, can't we
love one another just a little?

791
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:05,800
That's how peace begins.

792
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:10,024
We have so much
to love each other for.

793
01:06:10,059 --> 01:06:13,239
We have such possibilities,
my children.

794
01:06:13,817 --> 01:06:15,250
We could change the world.

795
01:06:15,819 --> 01:06:18,253
And while we hugged each other,
what would Philip do?

796
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:21,290
Oh, good God, Philip!

797
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:24,828
We're supposed to start a war. If
father finds out, I'll be rulned.

798
01:06:24,863 --> 01:06:28,127
Steady, John. Don't panic.
Some adviser you are.

799
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:31,332
Don't do anything without me. Let me
handle it. He's made a pact with Philip.

800
01:06:31,835 --> 01:06:33,837
You advised John into making
war. That fearless boy...

801
01:06:33,872 --> 01:06:35,804
he's disinherited himself.

802
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,807
When Henry finds out... when
I tell him what John's done...

803
01:06:38,842 --> 01:06:42,112
I need a little time. Can you keep
John from Philip till I say so?

804
01:06:42,147 --> 01:06:45,382
Anything you say. Richard, I want
you out of here before this breaks.

805
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:47,384
And that means Philip.
Go to him, be desperate.

806
01:06:47,419 --> 01:06:49,384
Promise anything...
the vexin, brittany.

807
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:53,139
Once you're free and John is out
of favor, we'll make further plans.

808
01:06:53,174 --> 01:06:56,860
You see Philip. You're the diplomat.
You see him, you talk to him.

809
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,454
You're a friend.
You know him, I don't.

810
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,790
And Richard!

811
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:08,794
Promise anything.

812
01:07:14,544 --> 01:07:16,778
I've got the old boy
this time.

813
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:19,816
The damn fool thinks he
loves John. He believes it.

814
01:07:19,851 --> 01:07:22,478
That's where the knife
goes in...

815
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:28,480
knives.

816
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:31,817
Knives.

817
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:37,523
Where is that mirror? I'm Eleanor,
and I can look at anything.

818
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:42,804
My, what a lovely girl.

819
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:46,570
How could her king
have left her?

820
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,781
Philip?

821
01:08:03,026 --> 01:08:05,790
Philip!

822
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:10,031
It's working out. By morning,
I can be the chosen son.

823
01:08:10,066 --> 01:08:15,071
The crown can come to me. Are you still
with me? We'll have to fight them all.

824
01:08:15,106 --> 01:08:17,062
They'll band together once this
happens. Have I got your word?

825
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,810
Do I have yours? All England's
land in France if I support you?

826
01:08:20,845 --> 01:08:25,080
Are we allies then?
We were born to be.

827
01:08:25,115 --> 01:08:27,782
I should say something solemn,
but I haven't the time.

828
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:30,820
I'm off to father with news that
John's a traitor. After that...

829
01:08:30,855 --> 01:08:35,052
you stink! You know that?
You're a stinker, and you stink.

830
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:38,828
I'll kill you!
Ah!

831
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:40,193
Lump.

832
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:44,095
If you're a prince, there's
hope for every ape in africa.

833
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:47,200
I had you saved. I wasn't on
my way to father, but he was.

834
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:50,829
He would have gone to Henry and
betrayed you. Look, it's in his face.

835
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:54,844
It's true. I don't know
who my friends are.

836
01:08:54,879 --> 01:09:00,782
Philip?

837
01:09:01,785 --> 01:09:04,777
May we? That's what tapestries are for.

838
01:09:06,222 --> 01:09:08,782
I'll never learn.
I'll ruln everything.

839
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,290
Richard?
Hello, Richard.

840
01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:22,305
You're halfway to bed. I'll
wait for morning. Come in.

841
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,297
Mother sent me.
Come in anyway.

842
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:34,816
Our alchemists have stumbled
on the art of boiling burgundy.

843
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:39,823
It turns to steam, and when it
cools, we call it brandywine.

844
01:09:39,858 --> 01:09:43,384
I'm Henry's prisoner.
You find that charming?

845
01:09:43,827 --> 01:09:45,829
No. Then why the charming smile?

846
01:09:45,864 --> 01:09:47,843
I thought,
I can't think why,

847
01:09:47,878 --> 01:09:49,822
of when you were
in paris last.

848
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:53,436
Can it be two whole years
ago? It can. I need an army.

849
01:09:53,471 --> 01:09:55,438
It'll take the cold away.
I must have soldiers.

850
01:09:55,473 --> 01:09:58,807
Have I aged?
Do I seem older to you?

851
01:09:58,842 --> 01:10:02,835
They've been two fierce years. I've
studied, and I've trained to be a king.

852
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:07,484
I'll have your answer... yes or
no? You'll have it when I give it.

853
01:10:07,519 --> 01:10:09,484
You see?
I've changed.

854
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:12,856
I'm not the boy you taught to
hunt two years ago. Remember?

855
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:15,518
Racing after boar,
you flying first,

856
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:19,863
me scrambling after,
all day into dusk.

857
01:10:19,898 --> 01:10:23,867
Don't go. I must know. Will you help me?

858
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:26,859
Sit and we'll discuss it.

859
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,614
You never write.
To anyone.

860
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:41,879
Why should I make you
king of England?

861
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:44,853
Aren't I better off
with John or Geoffrey?

862
01:10:44,888 --> 01:10:47,891
Why have you to fight when I
could have the cretin or the fiend?

863
01:10:47,926 --> 01:10:51,691
Would we fight? We're
fighting now. Good night.

864
01:10:53,596 --> 01:10:55,864
You're still a boy.

865
01:10:55,899 --> 01:10:59,733
In some ways.
Which way did you have in mind?

866
01:10:59,903 --> 01:11:03,840
You haven't asked how much your
help is worth. You'll tell me.

867
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,807
You can have the vexin back.
And what else?

868
01:11:05,842 --> 01:11:08,572
All of brittany. Does that
matter? That's Geoffrey's.

869
01:11:08,845 --> 01:11:11,714
Possibly to Geoffrey. And what
else? That's all your help is worth.

870
01:11:11,749 --> 01:11:13,705
And in return,
what do you want from me?

871
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:15,715
Two thousand soldiers.

872
01:11:15,852 --> 01:11:17,717
- And what else?
- Five hundred knights on horse.

873
01:11:17,854 --> 01:11:19,821
- And what else?
- Arms and siege equlpment.

874
01:11:19,856 --> 01:11:24,759
- And what else?
- I never wrote because I thought you'd never answer.

875
01:11:28,798 --> 01:11:30,832
You got married.

876
01:11:30,867 --> 01:11:34,860
Does that make a difference? Doesn't it?

877
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:41,834
I've spent two years
on every street in hell.

878
01:11:45,848 --> 01:11:47,873
That's odd.
I never saw you there.

879
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:16,835
You haven't said
you loved me.

880
01:12:23,853 --> 01:12:25,844
When the time comes.

881
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:42,861
Shh.

882
01:12:57,887 --> 01:12:59,878
It's not too late
at night?

883
01:13:01,824 --> 01:13:04,792
I'd hoped you'd come.
Good!

884
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:07,819
We couldn't leave negotiations
where they were.

885
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:13,801
Ah!

886
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:17,840
I keep looking for your
father in you. He's not there.

887
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:19,831
I'll miss him.

888
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:23,846
Has Richard or the queen
been here to see you?

889
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:26,814
Does it matter? If they
haven't yet, they will.

890
01:13:26,849 --> 01:13:30,853
I want to reach a settlement. I
left you with too little earlier.

891
01:13:30,888 --> 01:13:33,821
Yes.
Nothing is too little.

892
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:35,823
I'm sorry
you're not fonder of me, lad.

893
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:39,862
Your father always said,
"be fond of stronger men. "

894
01:13:39,897 --> 01:13:41,853
No wonder
he loved everyone.

895
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:46,869
I've come to you
to offer peace.

896
01:13:46,904 --> 01:13:49,861
Piss on your peace.

897
01:13:50,873 --> 01:13:53,876
Your father would have wept.

898
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:55,867
My father was a weeper.

899
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,871
Fight me, and you'll lose.

900
01:14:00,817 --> 01:14:02,808
I can't lose, Henry.

901
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,788
I have time.
Why, just look at you.

902
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:10,827
Great heavy arms. But each
year they get a little heavier.

903
01:14:10,862 --> 01:14:14,848
The sand goes pit-pat
in the glass.

904
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:18,800
I'm in no hurry, Henry.
I've got time.

905
01:14:18,835 --> 01:14:22,839
Suppose I hurry things along. Suppose I
say that England is at war with France.

906
01:14:22,874 --> 01:14:27,809
Then France surrenders. I
don't have to fight to win.

907
01:14:27,844 --> 01:14:31,837
Take all you want... this county,
that one. You won't keep it long.

908
01:14:32,849 --> 01:14:35,841
What kind of courage
have you got?

909
01:14:36,853 --> 01:14:38,844
The tidal kind...

910
01:14:41,858 --> 01:14:43,849
it comes and goes.

911
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:47,829
By God, I'd love to turn you
loose on Eleanor. More brandywine?

912
01:14:47,864 --> 01:14:52,869
You recognize it? They were boiling
it in ireland before the snakes left.

913
01:14:52,904 --> 01:14:57,839
Well, things look a little bleak
for Henry, don't they?

914
01:14:57,874 --> 01:15:02,812
You'll say yes to Richard when he
comes... arms, soldiers, anything he asks.

915
01:15:02,847 --> 01:15:04,803
I'd be foolish not to.
Yeah.

916
01:15:05,815 --> 01:15:09,808
And withdraw it all before the battle
ever started. Wouldn't you, in my place?

917
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,822
Why fight Henry when his sons
will do it for you?

918
01:15:12,857 --> 01:15:15,790
Yes, exactly.

919
01:15:15,825 --> 01:15:19,818
- You've got promise, lad. That's
first-class thinking. - Thank you, sir.

920
01:15:33,843 --> 01:15:37,812
Good night. Good night? You're
going? We haven't settled anything.

921
01:15:37,847 --> 01:15:40,839
We open Christmas presents at noon.
Till then. You can't be finished with me.

922
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:44,854
Oh, but I am. It's been most
satisfactory. What's so satisfactory?

923
01:15:44,889 --> 01:15:49,871
Winning is. I did just
win. Surely you noticed.

924
01:15:49,906 --> 01:15:54,853
Not a thing. You
haven't won a damn thing.

925
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:58,833
Hmm.

926
01:15:58,868 --> 01:16:02,805
I found out the way your mind
works and the kind of man you are.

927
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,772
I know your plans
and expectations.

928
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:06,774
You've burbled every bit
of strategy you've got.

929
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:09,812
I know exactly what you will do
and exactly what you won't.

930
01:16:09,847 --> 01:16:11,779
And I've told you
exactly nothing!

931
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:15,818
To these aged eyes, boy, that's
what winning looks like! Dormez bien.

932
01:16:15,853 --> 01:16:17,809
You...

933
01:16:20,323 --> 01:16:23,815
you made my father nothing.

934
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:27,819
You were always better.

935
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:30,822
You bullied him,

936
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:33,801
you bellied with his wife,

937
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:36,839
you beat him down
in every war,

938
01:16:36,874 --> 01:16:39,353
you twisted every treaty,

939
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:41,833
you played mock the monk,

940
01:16:42,845 --> 01:16:45,848
and then you made him
love you for it.

941
01:16:45,883 --> 01:16:48,816
I was there.

942
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:51,819
His last words
went to you.

943
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:54,857
He was a loving man, and you've
learned nothing of it.

944
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:59,827
I learned how much fathers
live in sons.

945
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:03,798
A king like you has policy
prepared on everything.

946
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,792
What's the official line
on sodomy?

947
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:12,803
How stands the crown
on boys who do with boys?

948
01:17:17,813 --> 01:17:20,816
Richard finds his way
into so many legends.

949
01:17:20,851 --> 01:17:23,819
Let's hear yours
and see how it compares.

950
01:17:23,854 --> 01:17:25,838
He found me first
when I was 15.

951
01:17:25,873 --> 01:17:27,823
We were hunting.
It was nearly dark.

952
01:17:27,858 --> 01:17:30,838
My horse fell,
I was thrown.

953
01:17:30,873 --> 01:17:33,818
I woke to Richard
touching me.

954
01:17:35,831 --> 01:17:38,828
He asked me
if I loved him.

955
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:41,826
"Philip, do you love me?"

956
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:45,806
And I told him, "yes. "

957
01:17:45,841 --> 01:17:49,834
Do you know why
I told him yes?

958
01:17:50,846 --> 01:17:54,850
So that one day I could
tell you all about it.

959
01:17:54,885 --> 01:17:59,339
You cannot imagine
what that "yes" cost.

960
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:03,758
Imagine snuggling
to a chancred whore...

961
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:07,797
and bending back your lips into
something like a smile, saying,

962
01:18:07,832 --> 01:18:09,788
"yes,

963
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:14,792
"I love you,

964
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:17,873
"and I find you...

965
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:19,864
beautiful. "

966
01:18:22,878 --> 01:18:24,869
I don't know how I did it.

967
01:18:25,715 --> 01:18:29,913
- No! It wasn't like that!
- But it was.

968
01:18:32,822 --> 01:18:34,915
You loved me.

969
01:18:41,831 --> 01:18:43,822
Never.

970
01:18:53,009 --> 01:18:56,035
Get out. Please.

971
01:18:56,846 --> 01:18:58,040
I don't want you here.

972
01:18:58,848 --> 01:19:00,948
It's no great pleasure
to be here.

973
01:19:00,983 --> 01:19:03,951
So the royal corkscrew
finds me twisted, does he?

974
01:19:03,986 --> 01:19:07,790
I'll go tell your mother. She'll
be pleased. She knows. She sent me.

975
01:19:07,825 --> 01:19:10,758
How completely hers you are.

976
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:14,030
You've had four sons.
Who do you claim?

977
01:19:14,065 --> 01:19:16,030
Not Henry.
Not my buried brother.

978
01:19:16,065 --> 01:19:20,069
Not that monument to muck,
that epic idiot.

979
01:19:20,104 --> 01:19:22,950
Why him? Why always him and never me?

980
01:19:22,985 --> 01:19:25,797
He was the eldest.
He came first.

981
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:30,813
Christ, Henry,
is that all?

982
01:19:30,848 --> 01:19:33,111
You went with Eleanor.

983
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:37,147
You never called me.
You never said my name.

984
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:42,814
I'd have walked. I'd have
crawled. I'd have done anything.

985
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:48,187
It's not my fault.
I won't be blamed.

986
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:51,823
I only wanted you.

987
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:56,238
No, my crown. You want my
kingdom. You keep your kingdom.

988
01:19:56,273 --> 01:19:58,229
That I will.
I hope it kills you.

989
01:20:00,242 --> 01:20:04,235
Thank God I have another son.
Thank God for John.

990
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:08,283
And who shall we thank for
Geoffrey? You don't think much of me.

991
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:14,857
"Much"? I don't think
of you at all.

992
01:20:14,892 --> 01:20:17,825
Nurse used to say
I had your hands.

993
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:21,318
I might have had more of you.
Try seeing me.

994
01:20:21,597 --> 01:20:24,832
I haven't Richard's military skill,
but he was here betraying you, not I.

995
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:30,873
I haven't John's... God knows what you
see in John... and he's betrayed you too.

996
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:32,864
You think I'd ever
make you king?

997
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,866
You'll make me king
because I'm all you've got.

998
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:39,879
I was to be his chancellor.
Ask him why. I've heard enough.

999
01:20:40,416 --> 01:20:41,883
For moving John
to treason.

1000
01:20:43,419 --> 01:20:46,455
I don't doubt he offered,
I don't doubt you tried,

1001
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:49,447
and I don't doubt
John loves me.

1002
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:51,883
Like a glutton
loves his lunch.

1003
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:57,889
You turd.

1004
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:08,466
Well, John?

1005
01:21:09,845 --> 01:21:13,447
It isn't what you think.
What do I think?

1006
01:21:13,482 --> 01:21:17,520
What Geoffrey said. I wouldn't
plot against you, ever.

1007
01:21:17,555 --> 01:21:20,488
I know.
You're a good boy.

1008
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:24,425
Can I go now, please? It's
late. I ought to be in bed.

1009
01:21:32,568 --> 01:21:36,595
Couldn't you wait? Couldn't
you trust me? It was all yours.

1010
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:38,874
Couldn't you believe that?
Will you listen to the grief?

1011
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:41,866
Who do you think I bullt
this kingdom for? Me!

1012
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:44,578
Daddy did it all for me.

1013
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:47,878
When can I have it, daddy?
Not until we bury you?

1014
01:21:47,983 --> 01:21:52,655
- I loved you.
- You're a cold and bloody bastard, you are.

1015
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:55,647
And you don't love anything.

1016
01:21:58,694 --> 01:22:02,676
I'm it.
I'm all that's left.

1017
01:22:02,711 --> 01:22:06,658
Here, father.
Here I am.

1018
01:22:28,757 --> 01:22:32,853
My life, when it is written,
will read better than it lived.

1019
01:22:33,863 --> 01:22:37,800
Henry fitz-empress, first
plantagenet, a king at 21,

1020
01:22:37,835 --> 01:22:39,859
the ablest soldier
of an able time.

1021
01:22:41,804 --> 01:22:43,838
He led men well, he cared
for justice when he could...

1022
01:22:43,873 --> 01:22:47,832
and ruled, for 30 years, a state
as great as charlemagne's.

1023
01:22:48,878 --> 01:22:53,814
He married out of love
a woman out of legend.

1024
01:22:53,849 --> 01:22:57,876
Not in alexandria or rome or
camelot has there been such a queen.

1025
01:22:59,889 --> 01:23:03,826
She bore him many children,

1026
01:23:03,861 --> 01:23:05,793
but no sons.

1027
01:23:05,828 --> 01:23:08,820
King Henry had no sons.

1028
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:15,838
He had three whiskered things,
but he disowned them.

1029
01:23:15,873 --> 01:23:20,843
You're not mine!
We're not connected!

1030
01:23:20,878 --> 01:23:23,811
I deny you!

1031
01:23:23,846 --> 01:23:25,813
None of you will get my kingdom.
I leave you nothing!

1032
01:23:25,848 --> 01:23:30,842
And I wish you plague! May all
your children breech and die!

1033
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,851
My boys are gone.

1034
01:23:44,867 --> 01:23:46,858
I've lost my boys.

1035
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:09,324
You dare to damn me,
do you?

1036
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:11,827
Well, I'll damn you back.

1037
01:24:11,862 --> 01:24:14,819
Goddamn you!

1038
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:22,827
My boys are gone.

1039
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,831
I've lost my boys.

1040
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:33,838
Oh, jesus.

1041
01:24:35,851 --> 01:24:37,842
All my boys.

1042
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:52,850
Henry?

1043
01:27:47,009 --> 01:27:52,845
<i>The Christmas wine
is in the pot</i>

1044
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:59,048
<i>The Christmas coals
are red</i>

1045
01:28:00,022 --> 01:28:04,526
<i>I'll spend my day
the lover's way</i>

1046
01:28:04,561 --> 01:28:09,031
<i>Unwrapping all my gifts</i>

1047
01:28:09,066 --> 01:28:12,057
<i>In bed</i>

1048
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:17,088
<i>The Christmas mass</i>

1049
01:28:17,123 --> 01:28:20,073
<i>Is over now</i>

1050
01:28:20,108 --> 01:28:25,808
<i>The Christmas prayers
are done</i>

1051
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:32,786
No one else is caroling.
It might as well be lent.

1052
01:28:32,821 --> 01:28:37,159
When I was little, Christmas was
a time of great confusion to me.

1053
01:28:37,194 --> 01:28:40,822
The holy land had two kings...
God and uncle raymond.

1054
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:44,164
I never knew whose birthday
we were celebrating.

1055
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:47,191
Henry isn't here. Good, we
can talk behind his back.

1056
01:28:47,836 --> 01:28:49,827
What happened?
Don't you know?

1057
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:53,834
There was a scene with beds and
tapestries, and many things got said.

1058
01:28:54,243 --> 01:28:56,210
Spiced wine.

1059
01:28:56,245 --> 01:29:00,180
I'd forgotten Henry liked it.
May I stay?

1060
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:03,785
It's your room just as much as
mine. We're both in residence.

1061
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,219
Packed in like the poor,
three to a bed.

1062
01:29:07,789 --> 01:29:09,756
Did you love Henry...
ever?

1063
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:14,228
Ever? Back before the flood?
As long ago as rosamund.

1064
01:29:14,263 --> 01:29:18,800
Ah, that's prehistory, lamb. There
are no written records or survivors.

1065
01:29:18,835 --> 01:29:22,269
There are pictures. She was
prettier than you. Oh, much.

1066
01:29:22,304 --> 01:29:26,308
Her eyes, in certain light, were
violet, and all her teeth were even.

1067
01:29:26,343 --> 01:29:28,275
That's a rare, fair feature...
even teeth.

1068
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:32,814
She smiled to excess, but she
chewed with real distinction.

1069
01:29:32,849 --> 01:29:34,816
And you hate her
even now.

1070
01:29:34,851 --> 01:29:37,317
No, but I did.

1071
01:29:37,352 --> 01:29:42,590
He put her in my place, you see,
and that was very hard.

1072
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:47,829
Like you, she headed Henry's
table. That's my chair.

1073
01:29:49,398 --> 01:29:51,917
And so
you had her poisoned.

1074
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:54,401
No, I never poisoned rosamund.

1075
01:29:54,436 --> 01:29:56,427
Oh, I prayed for her to drop...

1076
01:29:56,838 --> 01:30:00,475
and smiled a little
when she did.

1077
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:02,809
Why aren't you happy?

1078
01:30:02,844 --> 01:30:07,482
Henry's keeping you. You
must be cleverer than I am.

1079
01:30:07,517 --> 01:30:09,449
I've tried feeling pity
for you,

1080
01:30:09,484 --> 01:30:11,850
but it keeps on turning
into something else.

1081
01:30:12,521 --> 01:30:14,488
Why pity?

1082
01:30:14,523 --> 01:30:18,860
You love Henry, but you
love his kingdom too.

1083
01:30:18,895 --> 01:30:21,563
You look at him,
and you see cities,

1084
01:30:21,598 --> 01:30:25,567
acreage, coastline,
taxes.

1085
01:30:25,602 --> 01:30:27,865
All I see is Henry.

1086
01:30:29,571 --> 01:30:31,869
Leave him to me,
can't you?

1087
01:30:33,608 --> 01:30:35,872
I left him years ago.

1088
01:30:37,612 --> 01:30:39,881
And I thought
I could move you.

1089
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:42,616
Were you always
like this?

1090
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:45,643
When I was young and worshipped
you, is this what you were like?

1091
01:30:45,887 --> 01:30:48,622
Most likely.

1092
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:53,685
Child, I'm finished, and I've come
to give him anything he asks for.

1093
01:30:55,697 --> 01:30:59,701
Do you know what I
should like for Christmas?

1094
01:30:59,736 --> 01:31:01,828
I should like
to see you suffer.

1095
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:08,674
Alais, just for you.

1096
01:31:12,848 --> 01:31:16,841
Alors, ma petite.

1097
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,746
J'ai peur, maman.
No, no.

1098
01:31:34,803 --> 01:31:37,795
The sky is pocked with stars.

1099
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:47,849
What eyes the wise men must have
had to see a new one in so many.

1100
01:31:47,884 --> 01:31:50,886
You look cold. I've mulled some wine.

1101
01:31:50,921 --> 01:31:53,854
I wonder...
were there fewer stars then?

1102
01:31:53,889 --> 01:31:57,893
I don't know. I fancy
there's a mystery in it.

1103
01:31:57,928 --> 01:32:00,828
What's this?
Warm wine.

1104
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,821
Why, so it is.

1105
01:32:06,835 --> 01:32:09,827
You are as beautiful
as I remembered.

1106
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,829
Off you go.
My widow wants to see me.

1107
01:32:13,842 --> 01:32:15,833
She came to find out what
your plans are. I know.

1108
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:19,839
She wants you back.
Go to your room.

1109
01:32:25,854 --> 01:32:28,846
So, you want me back.

1110
01:32:30,859 --> 01:32:32,826
She thinks I do.

1111
01:32:32,861 --> 01:32:35,864
She thinks the need
for loving never stops.

1112
01:32:35,899 --> 01:32:37,855
She has a point.

1113
01:32:38,867 --> 01:32:40,834
I marvel at you.
After all these years,

1114
01:32:40,869 --> 01:32:43,872
still like a democratic drawbridge,
going down for everybody.

1115
01:32:43,907 --> 01:32:47,865
At my age, there's not
much traffic anymore.

1116
01:32:49,878 --> 01:32:51,869
To your interminable health.

1117
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:59,888
- Well, wife, what's on your mind?
- I've just seen Richard.

1118
01:32:59,923 --> 01:33:03,051
Splendid boy.
He says you fought.

1119
01:33:03,825 --> 01:33:05,792
We always do.

1120
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:09,064
It's his impression that
you mean to disinherit them.

1121
01:33:09,099 --> 01:33:11,055
I fancy I'll relent.

1122
01:33:11,633 --> 01:33:14,067
Don't you?
I don't much care.

1123
01:33:14,102 --> 01:33:16,838
In fact, I wonder, Henry,
if I care for anything.

1124
01:33:16,873 --> 01:33:18,829
I wonder if I'm hungry
out of habit.

1125
01:33:19,107 --> 01:33:22,625
I could listen to you lie
for hours.

1126
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:26,143
So your lust is rusty.
Gorgeous.

1127
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:30,140
Henry, I'm so tired.

1128
01:33:30,619 --> 01:33:33,855
Sleep then. Sleep and
dream of me withcroutons.

1129
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:35,822
Henri a la mode.

1130
01:33:35,857 --> 01:33:39,159
- Henry, stop it.
- Eleanor, I haven't started.

1131
01:33:39,194 --> 01:33:42,230
What do you want? You want my
name on paper? I'll sign anything.

1132
01:33:42,265 --> 01:33:44,197
You want the Aquitaine
for John? It's John's.

1133
01:33:44,232 --> 01:33:48,236
It's his, it's yours, it's
anybody's. In exchange for what?

1134
01:33:48,271 --> 01:33:50,272
For nothing.
For a little qulet.

1135
01:33:50,307 --> 01:33:52,286
For an end to this,
for God's sake.

1136
01:33:52,321 --> 01:33:54,265
Sail me back to England,
lock me up...

1137
01:33:54,876 --> 01:33:57,276
and lose the key
and let me be alone.

1138
01:34:02,817 --> 01:34:04,808
You have my oath.

1139
01:34:07,255 --> 01:34:10,816
I give my word.
Oh, well.

1140
01:34:12,561 --> 01:34:14,825
Well, well.

1141
01:34:17,299 --> 01:34:21,827
Would you like a pillow?
Footstool? How about a shawl?

1142
01:34:22,037 --> 01:34:26,841
Your oaths are all profanities, your words a
curse, your name on paper is a waste of pulp!

1143
01:34:26,876 --> 01:34:30,333
I'm vilifying you, for
God's sake! Pay attention!

1144
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:34,371
How,

1145
01:34:34,849 --> 01:34:36,840
from where we started,

1146
01:34:38,386 --> 01:34:41,844
did we ever reach
this Christmas?

1147
01:34:44,859 --> 01:34:46,850
Step by step.

1148
01:34:49,864 --> 01:34:51,831
What happens to me now?

1149
01:34:51,866 --> 01:34:55,870
That's lively curiosity
from such a dead cat.

1150
01:34:55,905 --> 01:34:59,839
If you want to know
my plans, just ask me.

1151
01:34:59,874 --> 01:35:02,434
Conquer china, sack the
vatican, or take the veil.

1152
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:05,779
I'm not among the ones
who give a damn.

1153
01:35:05,814 --> 01:35:10,452
Just let me sign my lands
to John and go to bed.

1154
01:35:10,487 --> 01:35:12,786
No, you're too kind.
I can't accept.

1155
01:35:12,821 --> 01:35:16,825
Come on, man, I'll sign the thing
in blood or spit or bright blue ink.

1156
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:19,459
Let's have it done.
Let's not.

1157
01:35:19,494 --> 01:35:23,521
No, I don't think I want
your signature on anything.

1158
01:35:25,834 --> 01:35:28,530
You don't?
Dear God,

1159
01:35:28,837 --> 01:35:32,539
the pleasure I still get
from goading you.

1160
01:35:32,574 --> 01:35:36,711
You don't want John to have
my provinces? Bull's-eye.

1161
01:35:36,746 --> 01:35:40,814
I can't bear you when
you're smug. I know, I know.

1162
01:35:40,849 --> 01:35:45,620
You don't want Richard, and you
don't want John. You've grasped it.

1163
01:35:45,655 --> 01:35:48,822
All right, then,
shatter me!

1164
01:35:48,857 --> 01:35:53,658
Let me have it.
What do you want?

1165
01:35:55,864 --> 01:35:57,855
A new wife.

1166
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:07,798
Oh.

1167
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:13,780
So,

1168
01:36:13,815 --> 01:36:16,807
I'm to be annulled.

1169
01:36:20,689 --> 01:36:24,716
Well,
will the pope annul me,

1170
01:36:24,826 --> 01:36:26,693
do you think?

1171
01:36:26,728 --> 01:36:30,630
The pontiff owes me one
pontificate. I think he will.

1172
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:34,296
Out Eleanor,

1173
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:36,760
in alais.

1174
01:36:39,774 --> 01:36:44,837
- Why?
- A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.

1175
01:36:46,815 --> 01:36:49,841
That is the single thing...

1176
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:54,856
of which I would have thought
you had enough.

1177
01:36:54,891 --> 01:36:57,824
I want a son.
We could populate...

1178
01:36:57,859 --> 01:37:02,797
a country town with country
girls who've borne you sons.

1179
01:37:02,832 --> 01:37:05,800
How many is it?
Help me count the bastards.

1180
01:37:05,835 --> 01:37:07,791
All my sons are bastards.

1181
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:19,803
You really mean to do it.
Lady love, with all my heart.

1182
01:37:20,815 --> 01:37:22,782
Your sons are part of you.

1183
01:37:22,817 --> 01:37:25,820
Like warts and goiters,
and I'm having them removed.

1184
01:37:25,855 --> 01:37:28,840
We've made them.
They're our boys.

1185
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:31,351
I know, and good God,
look at them.

1186
01:37:31,386 --> 01:37:33,793
Geoffrey...
there's a masterpiece.

1187
01:37:33,828 --> 01:37:37,821
He isn't flesh, he's a device.
He's wheels and gears.

1188
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:41,801
And johnny...

1189
01:37:41,836 --> 01:37:44,828
was his latest treason
your idea?

1190
01:37:46,841 --> 01:37:50,810
I caught him lying,
and I've said, "he's young. "

1191
01:37:50,845 --> 01:37:53,813
I found him cheating, and
I've said, "he's just a boy. "

1192
01:37:53,848 --> 01:37:58,853
I've watched him steal and whore and
whip his servants, and he's not a child.

1193
01:37:58,888 --> 01:38:01,840
He's the man we made him.

1194
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:04,758
Don't share John with me.

1195
01:38:04,793 --> 01:38:08,786
He's your accomplishment.
And Richard's yours.

1196
01:38:10,799 --> 01:38:13,791
How could you send him off
to deal with Philip?

1197
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:17,800
I was tired.

1198
01:38:17,835 --> 01:38:19,797
I was busy.

1199
01:38:20,809 --> 01:38:22,776
They were friends.

1200
01:38:22,811 --> 01:38:25,803
Eleanor, he was the best.

1201
01:38:27,816 --> 01:38:31,820
From the cradle on, you cradled
him. I never had a chance.

1202
01:38:31,855 --> 01:38:34,812
You never wanted one. How
do you know? You took him.

1203
01:38:35,824 --> 01:38:38,827
Separation from your husband
you could bear, but not your son.

1204
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:41,847
Whatever I have done,
you made me do.

1205
01:38:41,882 --> 01:38:44,358
You threw me out of bed
for Richard.

1206
01:38:44,393 --> 01:38:46,800
Not until you threw me out
for rosamund.

1207
01:38:46,835 --> 01:38:52,841
It's not that simple. I won't
have it to be that simple.

1208
01:38:52,876 --> 01:38:56,845
I adored you.
Never.

1209
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,813
I still do.

1210
01:38:59,848 --> 01:39:02,784
Of all the lies,
that one is the most terrible.

1211
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:07,778
I know. That's why
I saved it up for now.

1212
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:24,795
Oh, Henry, we've mangled
everything we've touched.

1213
01:39:25,807 --> 01:39:29,800
Deny us what you will,
we have done that.

1214
01:39:32,814 --> 01:39:36,783
Do you remember when we met?

1215
01:39:36,818 --> 01:39:40,811
Down to the hour
and color of your stockings.

1216
01:39:45,827 --> 01:39:49,831
I could hardly see you
for the sunlight.

1217
01:39:49,866 --> 01:39:52,823
It was raining,
but no matter.

1218
01:39:56,838 --> 01:40:00,842
There was very little talk,
as I recall.

1219
01:40:00,877 --> 01:40:02,809
Very little.

1220
01:40:02,844 --> 01:40:06,342
I had never seen
such beauty.

1221
01:40:06,377 --> 01:40:09,840
I walked right up
and touched it.

1222
01:40:11,853 --> 01:40:14,856
God, where did I find
the gall to do that?

1223
01:40:14,891 --> 01:40:17,848
In my eyes.

1224
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,851
I loved you.

1225
01:40:33,875 --> 01:40:36,843
No annulment.

1226
01:40:36,878 --> 01:40:40,871
What? There will be no annulment.

1227
01:40:40,949 --> 01:40:44,886
Will there not? No, I'm afraid
you'll have to do without.

1228
01:40:44,921 --> 01:40:47,954
Well, it was
just a whim.

1229
01:40:47,989 --> 01:40:51,982
I'm so relieved.
I didn't want to lose you.

1230
01:40:54,028 --> 01:40:59,022
Out of curiosity, as
intellectual to intellectual,

1231
01:40:59,901 --> 01:41:02,836
how in the name of bleeding
jesus can you lose me?

1232
01:41:04,839 --> 01:41:05,999
Do we ever see each other?
Am I ever near you?

1233
01:41:06,841 --> 01:41:09,002
Ever with you? Am I ever
anywhere but somewhere else?

1234
01:41:09,844 --> 01:41:11,811
Do I write?
Do we send messages?

1235
01:41:11,846 --> 01:41:15,850
Do dinghies bearing gifts float up
the thames to you? Are you remembered?

1236
01:41:15,885 --> 01:41:17,817
You are.

1237
01:41:17,852 --> 01:41:21,856
You're no part of me. We
do not touch at any point.

1238
01:41:21,891 --> 01:41:25,371
How can you lose me?
Can't you feel the chains?

1239
01:41:25,406 --> 01:41:28,852
You know me well enough
to know I can't be stopped.

1240
01:41:29,097 --> 01:41:32,832
I don't have to stop you.
I have only to delay you.

1241
01:41:32,867 --> 01:41:38,139
Every enemy you have has friends
in rome. We'll cost you time.

1242
01:41:38,174 --> 01:41:41,841
What is this?
I'm not moldering.

1243
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:46,176
My paint's not peeling. I'm
good for years. How many years?

1244
01:41:46,447 --> 01:41:51,168
Suppose I hold you back for one.
I can. It's possible.

1245
01:41:51,203 --> 01:41:55,890
Suppose your first son dies.
Ours did. It's possible.

1246
01:41:55,925 --> 01:41:59,227
Suppose you're daughtered next.
We were.

1247
01:41:59,262 --> 01:42:02,547
That, too,
is possible.

1248
01:42:02,582 --> 01:42:05,709
How old is daddy then?

1249
01:42:05,744 --> 01:42:08,801
What kind of spindly,

1250
01:42:08,836 --> 01:42:12,805
rickett-ridden, milky,
wizened, dim-eyed,

1251
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:18,846
gammy-handed, limpy line
of things will you beget?

1252
01:42:18,881 --> 01:42:20,813
It's sweet of you to care.

1253
01:42:20,848 --> 01:42:25,853
And when you die, which is
regrettable but necessary,

1254
01:42:25,888 --> 01:42:30,823
what will happen to frail alais
and her pruney prince?

1255
01:42:30,858 --> 01:42:35,852
You can't think Richard's going
to wait for your grotesque to grow.

1256
01:42:36,864 --> 01:42:39,832
You wouldn't let him
do a thing like that?

1257
01:42:39,867 --> 01:42:43,860
Let him? I'd push him
through the nursery door.

1258
01:42:44,872 --> 01:42:47,840
You're not that cruel.

1259
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:51,879
Don't fret. We'll wait
until you're dead to do it.

1260
01:42:51,914 --> 01:42:55,848
Eleanor, what do you want?

1261
01:42:55,883 --> 01:42:57,850
Just what you want...
a king for a son.

1262
01:42:57,885 --> 01:43:01,788
You can make more, I can't.
You think I want to disappear?

1263
01:43:01,823 --> 01:43:06,817
One son is all I've got, and you
can blot him out and call me cruel?

1264
01:43:07,662 --> 01:43:10,832
For these ten years, you've
lived with everything I've lost...

1265
01:43:10,867 --> 01:43:14,836
and loved another woman
through it all, and I am cruel?

1266
01:43:14,871 --> 01:43:16,836
I could peel you like a pear,

1267
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:20,898
and God himself
would call it justice.

1268
01:43:23,845 --> 01:43:25,904
I will die sometime soon.

1269
01:43:26,914 --> 01:43:29,816
One day I'll duck too slow,
and at westminster,

1270
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:31,953
they'll sing out "long live
the king" for someone else.

1271
01:43:31,988 --> 01:43:34,856
I beg you, let it be
a son of mine.

1272
01:43:34,891 --> 01:43:39,826
I am not moved to tears.

1273
01:43:39,861 --> 01:43:44,855
I have no sons. You have too
many sons. You don't need more.

1274
01:43:49,871 --> 01:43:51,838
Well, wish me luck.
I'm off.

1275
01:43:51,873 --> 01:43:54,865
To rome? That's where
they keep the pope.

1276
01:43:55,042 --> 01:43:57,844
You don't dare go!

1277
01:43:57,879 --> 01:44:00,780
Say that again at noon.
You'll say it to my horse's ass.

1278
01:44:00,815 --> 01:44:04,819
Lamb, I'll be rid of you by easter!
You can count your reigning days!

1279
01:44:04,854 --> 01:44:06,786
You go to rome,
we'll rise against you!

1280
01:44:06,821 --> 01:44:09,016
Who will? Richard, Geoffrey,
John and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

1281
01:44:09,824 --> 01:44:13,055
The day those stout hearts band
together is the day that pigs get wings!

1282
01:44:13,828 --> 01:44:16,820
There'll be pork in the treetops
come morning!

1283
01:44:18,065 --> 01:44:21,091
Don't you see you've given them
a common cause: New sons?

1284
01:44:21,836 --> 01:44:23,827
You leave the country,
and you've lost it.

1285
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:30,834
- All of you at once?
- And Philip too. He'd join us.

1286
01:44:32,146 --> 01:44:34,137
Yes, he would.

1287
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:39,843
Now how's your trip
to rome?

1288
01:44:40,188 --> 01:44:44,824
Oh, I've got you,
got you, got you.

1289
01:44:44,859 --> 01:44:48,863
Should I take a thousand
men-at-arms, or is that showy?

1290
01:44:48,898 --> 01:44:51,197
Bluff away.

1291
01:44:51,232 --> 01:44:55,862
Ah, poor thing. How can I break
the news? You've just miscalculated.

1292
01:44:56,237 --> 01:44:58,228
Have I? How?

1293
01:44:58,873 --> 01:45:03,044
You should have lied. You should have
promised to be good while I was gone.

1294
01:45:03,079 --> 01:45:07,215
I would have let your three boys
loose. They could have fought me then.

1295
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:09,251
You wouldn't keep your sons
locked up here.

1296
01:45:09,286 --> 01:45:11,217
Why the devil wouldn't I?
You wouldn't dare.

1297
01:45:11,252 --> 01:45:14,244
Why not? Let them sit in
chinon for a while. I forbid it.

1298
01:45:14,522 --> 01:45:18,822
She forbids it. Did your father
sleep with me, or didn't he?

1299
01:45:20,828 --> 01:45:25,065
No doubt you're going to tell me
that he did. Would it upset you?

1300
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:29,268
What about the thousand men? I
say be gaudy and to hell with it.

1301
01:45:29,303 --> 01:45:33,341
Don't leave me, Henry. I'm at rock
bottom. I'll do anything to keep you.

1302
01:45:33,376 --> 01:45:36,809
I think you think you
mean it. Ask for something.

1303
01:45:36,844 --> 01:45:40,371
Eleanor, we're passed it, years
passed. Test me. Name an act.

1304
01:45:40,848 --> 01:45:44,350
There isn't one! About my
fornication with your father.

1305
01:45:44,385 --> 01:45:47,377
Yes, there is. You can expire. You first,
old man. I only hope I'm there to watch.

1306
01:45:47,855 --> 01:45:53,418
You're so afraid of dying. You're
so scared of it. Ah, poor Eleanor.

1307
01:45:53,861 --> 01:45:59,433
If only she'd lied. She did. She
said she never loved your father.

1308
01:45:59,468 --> 01:46:01,367
I can always count on you.

1309
01:46:01,402 --> 01:46:04,394
I never touched you without
thinking, "Geoffrey, Geoffrey. "

1310
01:46:04,805 --> 01:46:07,773
The day you hurt me,
I'll cry out.

1311
01:46:07,808 --> 01:46:10,776
I've put more horns on you
than Louis ever wore.

1312
01:46:10,811 --> 01:46:13,439
Am I supposed to care?
I'll kill you if you leave me.

1313
01:46:13,814 --> 01:46:19,418
You can try. I loved your
father's body. He was beautiful.

1314
01:46:19,453 --> 01:46:23,491
It never happened. I can see his
body now. Shall I describe it?

1315
01:46:23,526 --> 01:46:25,482
Eleanor, I hope you die!
His arms were rough,

1316
01:46:25,826 --> 01:46:27,460
with scars here.
No!

1317
01:46:27,495 --> 01:46:30,531
I can feel his arms!
I feel them!

1318
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:36,802
I feel it!

1319
01:46:36,837 --> 01:46:39,533
What?
Have I hurt you?

1320
01:46:40,841 --> 01:46:42,808
Let me finish!

1321
01:46:42,843 --> 01:46:45,835
You were in the next room
when he did it!

1322
01:47:03,597 --> 01:47:05,564
Well,

1323
01:47:05,599 --> 01:47:09,797
what family doesn't have
its ups and downs?

1324
01:47:14,809 --> 01:47:16,640
I'm cold.

1325
01:47:17,812 --> 01:47:20,679
I can't feel anything.

1326
01:47:21,816 --> 01:47:23,807
Not anything at all.

1327
01:47:26,821 --> 01:47:31,724
We couldn't go back,
could we, Henry?

1328
01:47:36,831 --> 01:47:39,732
William!

1329
01:47:44,205 --> 01:47:48,232
Up! Up!

1330
01:47:55,983 --> 01:47:59,851
When the king is off his ass,
nobody sleeps!

1331
01:50:10,718 --> 01:50:12,845
Up! Up!

1332
01:50:13,721 --> 01:50:14,847
Up! Up!

1333
01:50:22,863 --> 01:50:25,855
Tell her to pack. She
leaves when it's light.

1334
01:50:45,886 --> 01:50:47,854
Up, up!

1335
01:52:47,875 --> 01:52:50,843
- Henry?
- We're packing up and moving out.

1336
01:52:50,878 --> 01:52:54,882
Is there a war? What's happened?
Henry, what's the matter?

1337
01:52:54,917 --> 01:52:56,873
Nothing, for a change.
Would you believe it?

1338
01:52:57,017 --> 01:53:00,821
Where have you been all night?
What for? Making us an entourage.

1339
01:53:00,856 --> 01:53:02,812
We're off to rome
to see the pope.

1340
01:53:03,824 --> 01:53:04,813
He's excommunicated you again.

1341
01:53:05,826 --> 01:53:09,795
No, he's going to set me free.
I'm having Eleanor annulled.

1342
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:12,833
The nation will be shocked to learn
our marriage wasn't consummated.

1343
01:53:12,868 --> 01:53:14,800
Oh, be serious.
I am.

1344
01:53:14,835 --> 01:53:17,827
It seems that you and I
are getting married.

1345
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,831
By the pope himself.

1346
01:53:25,846 --> 01:53:28,343
You mean it?

1347
01:53:28,378 --> 01:53:30,840
Shall I kneel?

1348
01:53:31,852 --> 01:53:37,848
It's not another trick? The bridal
party's drilling on the cobblestones.

1349
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:58,844
- She'll find a way to stop us.
- How? She won't be here.

1350
01:53:58,879 --> 01:54:00,814
We're launching her for salisbury
tower when the winds change.

1351
01:54:00,849 --> 01:54:02,816
She'll be barging down
the river by lunchtime.

1352
01:54:02,851 --> 01:54:04,783
If she doesn't stop us,
Richard will.

1353
01:54:04,818 --> 01:54:08,822
Not anymore, I've corked him up. He's in
the cellar with his brothers and the wine.

1354
01:54:08,857 --> 01:54:12,826
The royal boys are aging with the
royal port. You haven't said yes.

1355
01:54:12,861 --> 01:54:14,793
Would you like
a formal declaration?

1356
01:54:14,828 --> 01:54:18,821
There, my finest angle.
It's on all the coins.

1357
01:54:19,867 --> 01:54:23,826
Sad alais,
will you marry me?

1358
01:54:24,872 --> 01:54:27,806
Be my queen.

1359
01:54:27,841 --> 01:54:29,900
We'll love each other,
and you'll give me sons.

1360
01:54:30,844 --> 01:54:33,380
Let's have six. We'll
do Eleanor one better.

1361
01:54:33,415 --> 01:54:35,881
We'll call the first one
Louis, if you like.

1362
01:54:35,916 --> 01:54:39,852
Louls le premier. How's
that for a king of England?

1363
01:54:47,995 --> 01:54:50,862
Henry, you can't ever
let them out.

1364
01:54:51,865 --> 01:54:55,834
You've lost me. Let who out? Your sons.

1365
01:54:55,869 --> 01:55:00,966
You've put them in the dungeon, and
you've got to keep them there forever.

1366
01:55:01,975 --> 01:55:04,893
Do I now? If they're free when you die,

1367
01:55:04,928 --> 01:55:07,811
it's the dungeon
or the nunnery for me.

1368
01:55:08,816 --> 01:55:11,011
But, Henry,
what about the child?

1369
01:55:11,819 --> 01:55:13,821
Don't bother me about the child.
The damn thing isn't born yet.

1370
01:55:13,856 --> 01:55:15,788
If they're free,
they'll kill it.

1371
01:55:15,823 --> 01:55:21,056
And I will not live to see
our children murdered.

1372
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:27,824
Henry!

1373
01:55:30,838 --> 01:55:33,102
Are you going down?

1374
01:55:36,844 --> 01:55:40,837
To let them out
or to keep them in?

1375
01:55:46,153 --> 01:55:50,155
Could you say
to a child of yours,

1376
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:53,853
"you've seen the sunlight
for the last time"?

1377
01:55:56,196 --> 01:55:59,859
Can you do it, Henry?

1378
01:56:00,801 --> 01:56:04,171
I shall have to,

1379
01:56:04,206 --> 01:56:06,162
shan't I?

1380
01:58:54,841 --> 01:58:56,832
He's here.

1381
01:58:58,845 --> 01:59:03,316
He'll get no satisfaction out of
me. He isn't going to see me beg.

1382
01:59:03,351 --> 01:59:07,788
Why, you chivalric fool, as if
the way one fell down mattered.

1383
01:59:07,823 --> 01:59:10,780
When the fall is all there is,
it matters.

1384
01:59:30,811 --> 01:59:32,778
My barge is sailing
with the tide.

1385
01:59:32,813 --> 01:59:34,804
- I've come to say good-bye.
- Does Henry know you're here?

1386
01:59:35,816 --> 01:59:37,807
I've brought you each a little
something. What's he planning?

1387
01:59:38,185 --> 01:59:40,813
Is he going to keep us here? For God's
sake, mother. I picked it out especially.

1388
01:59:47,828 --> 01:59:49,795
- How heavy is the outside guard?
- That's taken care of.

1389
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:52,833
The courtyard, the gates? They're putting
Henry's train together, and it's chaos.

1390
01:59:52,868 --> 01:59:54,833
You can walk right out. We'll go
to poitiers. He'll expect that.

1391
01:59:54,868 --> 01:59:57,354
But we'll meet him with an army
when he comes. You stick close to me.

1392
01:59:57,389 --> 01:59:59,840
When you run, run hard. Why run
at all? I think we ought to stay.

1393
01:59:59,875 --> 02:00:02,843
Stay here? Till Henry comes.
He will come, won't he?

1394
02:00:02,878 --> 02:00:05,811
And he'll come alone.

1395
02:00:05,846 --> 02:00:08,348
I count three knives to
one. You think we could?

1396
02:00:08,383 --> 02:00:10,851
I'd only do it wrong.
You kill him, I'll watch.

1397
02:00:10,886 --> 02:00:12,918
- Where are you going?
- Up for air.

1398
02:00:12,953 --> 02:00:16,922
Don't stop her. You don't
think I'm gonna let this happen.

1399
02:00:16,957 --> 02:00:20,861
If you tell, there'll be a rash of
executions, and you don't want that.

1400
02:00:20,896 --> 02:00:22,988
No, you don't want to lose
one of us, not even me.

1401
02:00:23,864 --> 02:00:25,964
You're clever, but I
wonder if you're right.

1402
02:00:25,999 --> 02:00:29,870
Warn him, it's the end of us. You
warn him not, it's the end of him.

1403
02:00:29,905 --> 02:00:33,874
It's that clear.
Take the knives and run.

1404
02:00:33,909 --> 02:00:36,394
No, Geoffrey's right.

1405
02:00:36,429 --> 02:00:39,155
You're not an assassin.

1406
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:41,847
Look again.
Richard.

1407
02:00:41,882 --> 02:00:45,085
Spare me that. You brought these
things. You want him dead? You do it.

1408
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:48,053
You unnatural animal.

1409
02:00:48,088 --> 02:00:51,056
Unnatural, mummy? You tell
me, what's nature's way?

1410
02:00:51,091 --> 02:00:54,895
If poison mushrooms grow and
babies come with crooked backs,

1411
02:00:54,930 --> 02:00:56,862
if goiters thrive
and dogs go mad...

1412
02:00:56,897 --> 02:01:00,031
and wives kill husbands,
what's unnatural?

1413
02:01:00,066 --> 02:01:03,092
Come, here stands your lamb. Come
cover him in kisses. He's all yours.

1414
02:01:03,837 --> 02:01:08,807
No, you're not mine.
I'm not responsible.

1415
02:01:08,842 --> 02:01:11,845
Where do you think I learned this
from? Who do you think I studied under?

1416
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:14,813
How old was I when you fought with
Henry first? Young. I don't know.

1417
02:01:14,848 --> 02:01:18,817
How many battles did I watch? But those
were battles, not a knife behind a door.

1418
02:01:18,852 --> 02:01:22,185
I never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.
What were you thinking when you fought him?

1419
02:01:22,856 --> 02:01:25,192
You. I did it all for you!
Of your unnatural animal?

1420
02:01:25,227 --> 02:01:27,826
You wanted father dead.
No, never that.

1421
02:01:27,861 --> 02:01:31,865
You tried to kill him.
Why? What did you want? Yes!

1422
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:35,232
I wanted Henry back.

1423
02:01:37,237 --> 02:01:39,228
Liar!

1424
02:01:40,874 --> 02:01:44,275
I wanted Henry.

1425
02:01:44,878 --> 02:01:48,279
Don't trust her. She'll
warn him if she gets a chance.

1426
02:01:52,886 --> 02:01:57,323
Dear, dear, whatever
shall we do with mother?

1427
02:02:34,961 --> 02:02:37,429
It wants light.

1428
02:02:42,469 --> 02:02:47,463
What we do in dungeons
needs the shades of day.

1429
02:02:49,876 --> 02:02:51,843
I stole the candles
from the chapel.

1430
02:02:51,878 --> 02:02:56,883
Jesus won't begrudge them,
and the chaplain works for me.

1431
02:02:56,918 --> 02:03:00,444
You look dreadful.
So do you.

1432
02:03:01,821 --> 02:03:04,483
I underslept a little.

1433
02:03:06,826 --> 02:03:09,818
We can all rest
in a little while.

1434
02:03:14,834 --> 02:03:18,531
There, that's better.

1435
02:03:18,838 --> 02:03:22,831
Bright and clear,
just like the morning.

1436
02:03:23,576 --> 02:03:25,840
Fine looking boy.

1437
02:03:29,582 --> 02:03:32,817
What do you want from us?
You must be mad.

1438
02:03:32,852 --> 02:03:36,845
Why did you have to come here?
Damn it, why did you come?

1439
02:03:37,624 --> 02:03:40,138
You were the best.

1440
02:03:40,173 --> 02:03:42,652
I told her so.

1441
02:03:42,862 --> 02:03:44,829
You, I loved.

1442
02:03:44,864 --> 02:03:47,856
You're going to keep us here.

1443
02:03:48,668 --> 02:03:52,706
You can't ever let me out.
You know you can't.

1444
02:03:52,741 --> 02:03:54,697
I'll never stop.

1445
02:03:55,709 --> 02:03:57,870
I can't stop either.

1446
02:04:28,208 --> 02:04:29,835
Brave boys...

1447
02:04:30,844 --> 02:04:32,835
that's what I have.

1448
02:04:39,386 --> 02:04:41,854
Come for me.

1449
02:05:04,811 --> 02:05:07,814
What's wrong?
You're Richard, aren't you?

1450
02:05:07,849 --> 02:05:09,781
But you're Henry.

1451
02:05:09,816 --> 02:05:14,821
Please, take me back.
Can't we try again?

1452
02:05:14,856 --> 02:05:16,812
Again?
We always have before.

1453
02:05:17,357 --> 02:05:21,817
Oh, yes,
we always have.

1454
02:05:26,866 --> 02:05:29,858
Go on!

1455
02:05:38,912 --> 02:05:40,903
Execute him.

1456
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:45,909
They're assassins,
aren't they?

1457
02:05:46,953 --> 02:05:49,945
This was treason, wasn't it?

1458
02:05:50,857 --> 02:05:55,851
You gave them life.
You take it.

1459
02:06:02,802 --> 02:06:06,966
Who's to say it's monstrous?
I'm the king. I call it just.

1460
02:06:14,814 --> 02:06:17,009
Therefore, I, Henry,
by the grace of God,

1461
02:06:17,817 --> 02:06:21,810
king of the english, lord of
scotland, ireland and wales,

1462
02:06:22,021 --> 02:06:24,819
count of anjou, brittany,
poutou and normandy,

1463
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:27,049
maine,
gascony and Aquitaine,

1464
02:06:28,828 --> 02:06:31,796
do sentence you to death.

1465
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:36,063
Done this Christmas day
in chinon in God's year 1183.

1466
02:07:23,216 --> 02:07:25,810
Surely that's not
what I intended.

1467
02:07:29,255 --> 02:07:31,246
Children.

1468
02:07:32,825 --> 02:07:34,816
Children.

1469
02:07:38,831 --> 02:07:40,822
They're all we have.

1470
02:07:43,836 --> 02:07:45,827
Go on.

1471
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:49,331
I'm done.

1472
02:07:51,844 --> 02:07:53,835
I'm finished with you.

1473
02:07:55,348 --> 02:07:57,373
You and I are finished.

1474
02:08:25,411 --> 02:08:29,814
You spare the rod,
you'll spoil those boys.

1475
02:08:35,822 --> 02:08:38,484
I couldn't do it, Eleanor.

1476
02:08:40,493 --> 02:08:42,825
Nobody thought you could.

1477
02:08:50,536 --> 02:08:52,527
Come rest.

1478
02:08:53,539 --> 02:08:58,567
I want no women in
my life. You're tired.

1479
02:08:58,845 --> 02:09:02,515
I could have conquered europe,
all of it,

1480
02:09:02,550 --> 02:09:04,779
but I had women in my life.

1481
02:09:06,786 --> 02:09:09,550
Go on, get out.
Go on.

1482
02:09:18,598 --> 02:09:22,591
I should have
killed you years ago.

1483
02:09:22,802 --> 02:09:26,602
You put me here. You made me
do mad things. You've bled me.

1484
02:09:26,806 --> 02:09:29,724
Shoulder it yourself.

1485
02:09:29,759 --> 02:09:32,642
Don't put it on my back.

1486
02:09:32,812 --> 02:09:35,804
Pick it up and carry it.
I can.

1487
02:09:36,649 --> 02:09:39,819
My losses are my work.

1488
02:09:39,854 --> 02:09:41,786
What losses?

1489
02:09:41,821 --> 02:09:44,688
I'm the one with nothing.

1490
02:09:44,824 --> 02:09:47,725
Lost your life's work,
have you?

1491
02:09:48,828 --> 02:09:51,831
Provinces are nothing.

1492
02:09:51,866 --> 02:09:54,799
Land is dirt.

1493
02:09:54,834 --> 02:10:00,773
I could take defeats like
yours and laugh. I've done it.

1494
02:10:00,808 --> 02:10:03,833
If you're broken,
it's because you're brittle.

1495
02:10:05,845 --> 02:10:08,831
I've lost.

1496
02:10:08,866 --> 02:10:11,817
You won.

1497
02:10:11,851 --> 02:10:15,810
And I can't ever
have you back again.

1498
02:10:17,857 --> 02:10:21,850
You're all
that I have ever loved.

1499
02:10:23,863 --> 02:10:27,856
Christ, you don't know
what nothing is.

1500
02:10:28,868 --> 02:10:31,871
I want to die.
No, you don't.

1501
02:10:31,906 --> 02:10:35,392
I want to die.
I'll hold you.

1502
02:10:35,427 --> 02:10:38,654
Henry, I want to die.
Eleanor.

1503
02:10:38,689 --> 02:10:41,881
I want to die.
Let me hold you.

1504
02:10:41,916 --> 02:10:43,872
I want to die.

1505
02:10:44,884 --> 02:10:47,852
You will, you know,
someday.

1506
02:10:47,887 --> 02:10:49,889
Just wait long enough,
and it'll happen.

1507
02:10:54,894 --> 02:10:56,885
So it will.

1508
02:11:01,834 --> 02:11:05,838
We're in the cellar,
you're going back to prison,

1509
02:11:05,873 --> 02:11:10,843
my life is wasted,
we've lost each other,

1510
02:11:10,878 --> 02:11:12,834
and you're smiling.

1511
02:11:14,847 --> 02:11:17,839
It's the way
I register despair.

1512
02:11:21,854 --> 02:11:24,846
There's everything in life
but hope.

1513
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:29,851
We're both alive.

1514
02:11:31,864 --> 02:11:34,856
And for all I know,
that's what hope is.

1515
02:11:42,875 --> 02:11:45,867
We're jungle creatures,
Henry,

1516
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:51,873
and the dark
is all around us.

1517
02:11:53,886 --> 02:11:57,890
See them...
in the corners?

1518
02:11:57,925 --> 02:12:00,825
You can see the eyes.

1519
02:12:08,835 --> 02:12:10,826
And they can see ours.

1520
02:12:20,847 --> 02:12:22,838
I'm a match for anything.

1521
02:12:24,851 --> 02:12:26,818
Aren't you?

1522
02:12:26,853 --> 02:12:30,857
I should have been
a great fool...

1523
02:12:30,892 --> 02:12:32,848
not to love you.

1524
02:12:50,877 --> 02:12:52,844
You'll let me out
for easter?

1525
02:12:52,879 --> 02:12:56,883
Come the resurrection,
you can strike me down again.

1526
02:12:56,918 --> 02:12:58,885
Perhaps next time
I'll do it.

1527
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:01,820
And perhaps you won't.

1528
02:13:10,830 --> 02:13:14,834
You know,
I hope we never die!

1529
02:13:14,869 --> 02:13:16,825
So do I.

1530
02:13:17,036 --> 02:13:19,839
You think there's
any chance of it?
