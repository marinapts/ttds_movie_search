<i>It's your misfortune

Get along, little doggies

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,399
For you know New York
will be your new home

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,595
Get along, little doggies

6
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,150
<i>It's your misfortune

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,710
<i>Where's that Joe Buck?</i>

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,553
Get along, little doggies

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,310
Look at this crap!

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,709
<i>Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?</i>

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,758
<i>Where's that Joe Buck?</i>

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,399
You're late!

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,314
You know what you can do
with them dishes.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,757
<i>If you ain't man enough,
I'd be happy to oblige.</i>

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,273
I really would.

16
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,192
<i>How you doin', Ralph?</i>

17
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,072
<i>4.00 to midnight.
That's when you're here.</i>

18
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,516
Could you have a word with me?

19
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,752
Why are you in that getup?
Grab an apron.

20
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,556
He knows what he can do
with that.

21
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,108
- You come to work?
- Guess not.

22
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,476
<i>Come for my pay.
I'm heading up east.</i>

23
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,950
<i>- Heading up east?
- Thought I'd say goodbye.</i>

24
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,156
Just come to look around.

25
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,275
Cups!

26
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,468
Well...

27
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,679
Goodbye.

28
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,355
Goodbye.
What'll you do back east?

29
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,150
<i>There's a lot of rich women
begging and paying for it.</i>

30
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,596
The men are tutti-fruttis.

32
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,875
<i>It's a mess back there.</i>

33
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,632
<i>I'm gonna cash in.</i>

34
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,154
<i>I don't know nothing about it.</i>

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,472
Why stay around here?
I got places to go.

36
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,757
<i>Oh, that's nice.</i>

37
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,398
Oh, lower...

38
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,270
<i>That's real... nice, honey.</i>

39
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,832
<i>It's powerful, ain't it?</i>

40
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,156
Yeah, sure is powerful.

41
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,478
<i>It's shooting season.</i>

42

<i>Go to Lloyd's
for all of your gun supplies.</i>

43
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,718
Listen to these values:
Remington shotgun for $72.47...

44
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,591
You look real nice, lover boy.

45
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,158
Make your old grandma proud.

46
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,277
You're the handsomest cowboy

<i>the best-lookin' one.</i>

48

<i>Bye, honey.
Dinner's in the fridge.</i>

49
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,195
Grandma got herself a new beau!

50
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,037
Excuse me. Do you have
another piece of gum for her?

51
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,952
Yes, I do. Here.

52
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,277
Take one for yourself.

53
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,275
<i>No, thanks. It's just till the
Dramamine works. She's carsick.</i>

54
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,430
I get carsick on boats.

55
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,708
<i>But that's more the fish smell
than the bouncing.</i>

56
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,472
How far you headed?

57
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,029
- To Dallas.
- Up Dallas?

58
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,351
- Where you going?
- New York City, ma'am.

59
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,712
Do you love me, Joe?

60
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,190
Do you love me? You love me?

61

You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.

62

You're better

You're the best, Joe. The best.

67

This is the Sunshine Hour.

68

Yes, sweet Jesus, faith healeth!

69

<i>and two tumours she coughed up
during last week's broadcast.</i>

71
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,758
Before we join
in prayer for her,

72
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,312
Jesus wants to know who sent in
$5.00 for the home worship kit.

73
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,075
- Want a cigarette, sir?
- No, thanks. Chew tobacco.

74
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,992
<i>...with Sister Rosellen.</i>

75
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,072
Throw in Rosellen,
you got a deal!

76
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,357
You ever met a cowhand named
Woodsy Niles? Woodsy Niles, sir?

77
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,477
<i>- Not to my knowledge.
- My grandma's friend.</i>

78
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,392
I want it on.

79
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,911
<i>For it's hi! Hi! Hee!

98

<i>Everything but the sofa.
That's my remedy for insomnia.</i>

99

Ma'am!

110
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,518
Were you serious

<i>- Yes, ma'am. I mean business.

Well, the Statue of Liberty...

I think you take
the Seventh Avenue subway.

114

- No, wait...
- You're sure pretty.

115

You're not looking for
the Statue of Liberty at all!

116
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,992
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

<i>Come on, Baby, do it for Mama.
Come on, Mama's tired.</i>

How do you feel?

127
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,554
I loved your friend

the last of the great
King Midases.

My God, I was exhausted.
It was beautiful, but...

130

God, stop!
I die from that! What?

131
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,713
No one. I was talking to Baby.
I was talking to the dog, Maury.

132

<i>You're annoying me.
Don't start up again.</i>

Baby wants to say hello.</i>

<i>I won't talk to the dog!</i>

135
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,998
- Daddy wants to say hello.
- Hello, Baby.

136
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,472
Hello, you goddamn dog.
Bow-wow-wow, Baby.

- What time?

140
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,872
<i>Like 5.30.
We don't have to rush.</i>

141
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,952
<i>- My wife's away.
- Beautiful, baby.</i>

142
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,874
I can stay all night.
How about a kiss?

143
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,748
You got it. A big wet one.

144

Save some of that

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,234
<i>Knock off a couple of pounds,
and I'd really be gorgeous.</i>

157
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,838
<i>Don't touch. I'm late already.
What time is it? Oh, my God.</i>

158
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,796
Straighten out the bed, Tex.

159
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,997
Say, Cass, sure have
enjoyed being here.

160
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,868
<i>It's as fine a time
as I've ever had.</i>

161
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,428
<i>- Me, too, lover.
- That's good.</i>

162
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,231
You made me feel so at home,
I hate to bring up business.

163
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,598
<i>It's murder. What line are
you in? Zip me up.</i>

164
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,838
<i>Maury's always complaining
about ulcers.</i>

165
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,109
<i>I don't know what line Maury's
in, but I'm a kind of hustler.</i>

166
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,956
Pardon me, ma'am?

167
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,951
Got to make a living.

168
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,273
<i>- Did you hear me?
- My mind isn't all here.</i>

169
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,990
<i>I don't want to be late.
Why don't you run along.</i>

170
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,629
Take the number.
We'll get in touch soon.

171
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,637
I forgot to get to the bank.
I need a few bucks for a taxi.

172
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,918
I hate to ask you,
but you're such a doll.

173
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,197
<i>That's funny,
you mentioning money.</i>

174
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,674
- I was gonna ask you for some.
- You were?

175
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,752
<i>That's why I come up here.</i>

176
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,392
You were gonna ask me for money.
Who do you think I am?

177
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,153
Some old slut on 42nd Street?

178
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,995
<i>In case you didn't notice,
you Texas longhorn bull,</i>

179
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,877
<i>I'm a gorgeous chick!</i>

180
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
- Take it easy.
- You're 28!

181
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,876
<i>You can't pull
this kind of crap!</i>

182
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,349
- You're crazy!
- Come on now.

183
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,955
I could kill you!
Get out of here!

184
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,031
Get out of here!

185
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,113
Cass, honey...

186
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,079
Come on.

187
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,035
You think I meant that?

188
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,796
Would I ask you for money
with a wad like that?

189
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,440
Stop your crying.
You're gorgeous.

190
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,548
<i>A guy gets horny just lookin'
at you. How much you want?</i>

191
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,712
Five? Ten?

192
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,593
Twenty?

193
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,756
There you go, girl.

194
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,799
Terrific shirt.

195
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,908
- You speaking to me?
- I was admiring your shirt.

196
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,959
I bet you paid
a pretty price for it.

197
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,793
<i>- I ain't cheap.
- Yeah. Birds.</i>

198
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,599
<i>- It's an all-right shirt.
- I like birds.</i>

199
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,150
<i>I don't like
to wear cheap stuff.</i>

200
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,993
- Sure.
- Hi, cowboy. Got a cigarette?

201
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,319
- Hey, sweetheart.
- More faggots in this town...

202
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,789
- Kiss it, Ratso.
- Up yours.

203
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,668
- Watch out for that.
- You really know the ropes.

204
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,320
Wish I bumped into you before.

205
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,273
- Joe Buck from Texas.
- Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx.

206
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,397
<i>- I'm gonna buy you a drink.
- Sure.</i>

207
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,029
Drinks all around.
One for my friend, too.

208
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,033
When I get satisfaction,
I give her satisfaction.

209
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,954
<i>See what I'm getting at?
She got a penthouse,</i>

210
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,316
a colour TV, more diamonds
than the archbishop.

211
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,676
- She bawls when I ask her.
- For what?

212
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,116
- For money.
- Money for what?

213
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,476
<i>I'm a hustler.
You didn't know that?</i>

214
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,553
How should I know? You gotta
tell people these things.

215
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,312
<i>I'm a hustler.</i>

216
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,676
All right, you're a hustler.

217
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,152
<i>You're pickin' up trade
on the street... that's nowhere.</i>

218
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,598
- You gotta get some management.
- You put your finger on it.

219
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,559
You need my friend O'Daniel.

220
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,838
He operates the biggest stable
in the whole metropolitan area.

221
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,878
<i>It's stupid,
a stud like you paying.</i>

222
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,748
<i>A dame starts crying,
I'd cut my heart out.</i>

223
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,798
<i>I'd call that
a very minor operation.</i>

224
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,193
You just sit comfy, and
I'll cut it out for you, Ratso.

225
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,033
<i>- It's Rizzo.
- That's what I said.</i>

226
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,554
<i>- You heard him.
- That's OK.</i>

227
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,952
<i>I'm used to these types
that like picking on cripples.</i>

228
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,715
<i>- The sewer's full of 'em.
- One question, cowboy.</i>

229
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,712
<i>You're sitting here,
and he's sitting there.</i>

230
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,318
<i>How'll he get into your pocket?
But I guess he's figured it out.</i>

231
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,029
- Good night, sweets.
- Faggot.

232
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,358
Most of these gals
are older, dignified.

233
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,431
Social register types.

234
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,354
<i>They can't pick out
the merchandise in Times Square.</i>

235
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,116
<i>They got to have a middleman.
That's where O'Daniel comes in.</i>

236
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,879
<i>Hey! I'm walkin' here!</i>

237
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,748
Up yours, you son of a bitch!

238
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,872
<i>Don't worry about that.
Good way to pick up insurance.</i>

239
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,715
<i>That's crazy, a stud like you
paying that dame.</i>

240
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,392
With proper management,

241
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,836
you could earn 50,
$100 a day, easy.

242
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,117
Hey, Brucie,
hang in there, baby.

243
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,474
<i>What's that?</i>

244
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,438
Placed him with O'Daniel
two weeks ago.

245
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,750
<i>Ain't much of a stud.</i>

246
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,553
All right.

247
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,668
How about you introduce me
to Mr O'Diddleburg right now?

248
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,595
<i>I'd be doing both of you
a favour, but for what?</i>

249
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,036
Why am I dragging
my bum leg around?

250
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,113
Tomorrow, someone like that
may be scratching your back.

251
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,918
Where will I be?

252
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,993
<i>Hold on. You think
I'm that kind of son'bitch?</i>

253
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,437
You name your cut,
and you got it, I swear.

254
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,432
- All right.
- What you want? Five? Ten?

255
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,876
You kidding me?
I'll ask somebody else.

256
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,951
<i>- There's ten.
- All right.</i>

257
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,873
Forget it. I'll take the ten.

258
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,557
But I'll have to have
another ten to cover expenses.

259
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,393
I'll buy you a coffee.

260
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,829
Get out of here, creeps.
Go to work.

261
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,837
<i>He needs you tonight.
I got his tongue hangin' out.</i>

262
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,276
<i>His name is Joe Buck.
He's a cowboy.</i>

263
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,717
<i>Came in from Texas.
He don't know the ropes yet,</i>

264
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,792
<i>but he's
very promising material.</i>

265
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,910
<i>Fabulous. Right away.
What's your room number again?</i>

266
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,433
Right. OK.

267
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,719
The guy...
Hold it a second, will you?

268
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,472
How do you look?

269
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,472
Fine. You look fine.

270
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,393
Could I have that other ten?

271
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,918
I'll make this right
when I get set up.

272
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,594
- Forget it.
- Where do you live?

273
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,037
<i>- Sherry Netherland's Hotel.
- Sherry Neverland's Hotel.</i>

274
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,875
<i>Get your ass in there.
He's waitin'. You on vacation?</i>

275
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,077
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

276
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,150
- You must be Joe Buck.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,958
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

278
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,235
Turn around.

279
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,794
Good strong back.
You'll need it.

280
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,235
So you want help, hey?

281
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,518
Sit down. Relax.

282
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,910
<i>- Cowboy?
- I ain't a for-real cowboy.</i>

283
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,834
<i>- I'm one hell of a stud.
- Take it easy.</i>

284
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,838
You're different
from most of the others.

285
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,754
Most of them
are troubled and confused.

286
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,559
You know exactly what you want.

287
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,437
You bet I do.

288
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,551
Yeah... but you got one thing
in common with those other boys.

289
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,517
I'll bet you're lonesome.

290
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,353
Well, not too. I mean, a little.

291
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,669
Lonesome.

292
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,672
<i>I'm lonesome, so I'm a drunk.</i>

293
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,709
<i>I'm lonesome, so I'm
a dope fiend, I'm a thief,</i>

294
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,679
<i>I'm a fornicator, a whoremonger!</i>

295
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,196
Poop, I say. Poop!
I've heard it all.

296
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,239
<i>- I'm sick of it.
- I can see that.</i>

297
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,238
Lonesomeness... you take it, and
you go right on with your work.

298
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,108
<i>- I'm rarin' to go, sir!
- I believe you are.</i>

299
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,192
- Cowboy, eh?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,636
<i>- Ready for hard work?
- I'm ready for anything!</i>

301
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,508
It'll be easier for you
than for most others.

302
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,512
- Like money from home.
- Money from home!

303
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,750
<i>There's your strength, son!</i>

304
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,469
You put things earthy
so anybody can understand.

305
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:51,351
<i>I warn you, I'm gonna use you.
I'm gonna run you ragged!</i>

306
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,788
You're wonderful, boy.
We'll have fun together.

307
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,917
<i>- It needn't be joyless.
- No, it don't.</i>

308
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,348
<i>Why don't you and me get right
down on our knees right now.</i>

309
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,274
<i>- How's that strike you?
- Where?</i>

310
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,674
Right here! Here!
Right now! Why not?

311
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,039
I've prayed in the streets,
the saloons, and the toilets.

312
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,398
<i>It don't matter where
if He gets that prayer!</i>

313
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,119
<i>- Shit!
- That's the ticket!</i>

314
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,320
Open your heart and let it flow!

315
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,439
<i>- Don't be frightened!
- I baptise thee...</i>

316
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,160
And you shall be heard!

317
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,436
<i>...and the Holy Spirit.</i>

318
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,391
<i>Don't run from Him!</i>

319
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,990
You know that runty bastard
I was with?

320
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,638
<i>Don't know nothing.</i>

321
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,592
Stop it! Stop it!

322
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,076
<i>What's that monstrosity?</i>

323
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,754
- A toupee for dogs.
- For dogs?

324
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,834
<i>- This is Fifi's wig.
- That's for that dog?</i>

325
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,835
<i>I don't believe this!
There's something going on here.</i>

326
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,109
<i>Seriously, isn't this a case of
conning a lot of lonely people?</i>

327
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,319
We're lonely, yes.
Who else would do it?

328
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,074
A woman who is alone...

329
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,516
<i>Dinner's in the fridge,
lover boy.</i>

330
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,113
<i>Here's movie money.</i>

331
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,839
<i>That's sick,
dressing dogs like children.</i>

332
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,551
This is in case
she eats an onion.

333
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,678
<i>- That's terrible!
- She likes it.</i>

334
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,273
If I can find the hole...

335
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,519
Gold, silver, candlelight,

336
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,915
wine, and skyrockets
that glitter in your mind.

337
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,714
You're special.
Give yourself special treatment.

338
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,677
<i>Need money?
We'd love to lend it to you.</i>

339
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,073
Why worry about your future?
What do you want?

340
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,799
Take it easy, but take it.

341
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,155
Room 514, please.

342
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,628
Looks like you been locked out
till you pick up the tab.

343
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,915
What about all my things?

344
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,788
We keep them safe
till you get this settled.

345
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,319
You can keep everything but the
suitcase. It means a lot to me.

346
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,709
We keep everything. House rules.

347
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,712
Gonna eat them crackers?

348
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,838
<i>Spilled somethin' on my pants.</i>

349
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,792
- How do I get to Grand Central?
- Follow the green lights.

350
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,078
Officer, how do I get
to Grand Central?

351
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,316
You know what
you got to do, cowboy?

352
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,751
Spacecraft to Earth Control.
Check trajectory.

353
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,753
Captain Grace is
investigating the malfunction.

354
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,913
Orbital module has failed
to separate as planned.

355
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,076
Mission Control to spacecraft.
You have 30 seconds...

356
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,835
before you are ejected
into lunar trajectory.

357
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,592
Do you read me?

358
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,758
Spacecraft to Earth Control,
I read you.

359
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,229
Chuck, I've lost you!

360
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,757
We've lost contact with Captain
Grace. Can you track him?

361
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,911
Kiss me, Joe.

362
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,073
<i>He's in freefall.
Try to make contact.</i>

363
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,672
You're the only one, Joe.

364
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,472
<i>Kissin' Crazy Annie, man,
you'd better drink a drugstore.</i>

365
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,559
Kiss me, Joe.

366
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,158
You're the only one, Joe!

367
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,755
<i>I'm sorry you're sick.</i>

368
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,398
You'll have to give me
that money.

369
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,268
<i>I was lying. I don't have it.
What'll you do to me?</i>

370
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,319
<i>- You ain't got no $25 on you?
- No.</i>

371
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,393
- What'll you do to me?
- What do you think?

372
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,110
Want me to beat on you?
Is that what you want?

373
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,270
- How much you got?
- Nothing.

374
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,920
Empty your pockets out
over there.

375
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,558
<i>- Take my books.
- Don't want your books.</i>

376
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,757
<i>- What's that worth?
- Don't take my watch.</i>

377
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,719
<i>Please don't take it.
It's a cheap watch.</i>

378
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,952
<i>I can't go home without it.</i>

379
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,194
<i>My mother would die.
Don't take it. She'd die.</i>

380
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,191
She would die.

381
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,952
Please.

382
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,877
<i>I don't want it.</i>

383
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,270
Preparing for
this moment of glory,

384
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,752
<i>a basic training as rigorous
as the the star players'...</i>

385
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,876
long hours of choreography...

386
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,872
that would put
the Rockettes to shame.

387
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,953
Musical arrangements,
rehearsals, costume fittings.

388
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,989
America is being invaded.

389
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,516
You can spot the invaders
if they're alone.

390
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,115
They're dark, heavy,
and have noticeable accents.

391
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,670
Every day, they're working
themselves into more homes.

392
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,389
What can you do about them?
Enjoy them.

393
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,315
Better Homes and Gardens tells
you about new Spanish furniture.

394
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,437
<i>Don't hit me! I'm a cripple!</i>

395
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,876
<i>I ain't gonna hit you.
I'll strangle you!</i>

396
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,635
<i>- Wait a minute.
- Where's my money?</i>

397
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,358
- Here.
- Put it there.

398
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,512
All right, here.

399
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,398
<i>- That's all I got.
- That's all?</i>

400
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,512
<i>- What's in your socks?
- Nothing, I swear.</i>

401
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,152
<i>I swear on my mother's eyes.
Sixty-four cents. Take it.</i>

402
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,754
<i>It's sticky.
You slobber on it?</i>

403
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,992
Here. Have a cigarette.
Come on.

404
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,799
Come on.

405
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,394
Sit down.

406
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,918
<i>How do you like
O'Daniel flippin' out?</i>

407
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,555
I tried to find you,
but I've had this cold.

408
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,037
You want some medical advice?
Keep your mouth shut about that.

409
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,908
Right. Fine. OK.
Another subject.

410
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,116
You still at the hotel?

411
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,920
<i>Why am I talkin' to you?</i>

412
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,472
Hey, come on!

413
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,357
- Hey, wait up!
- Keep away from me!

414
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,079
<i>Don't come near me again.</i>

415
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,551
<i>I ain't fightin' you.
I got a place for you.</i>

416
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,757
<i>- I'm invitin' you!
- You're inviting shit.</i>

417
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,114
<i>The "X" on the windows
means no rent. It's condemned.</i>

418
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,870
Front door. Actually,
I prefer it that way.

419
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,520
Keeps the punks and creeps out.

420
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,078
My own private entrance.
You're the only one who knows.

421
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,635
Watch the plank!
Break your goddamn skull.

422
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,233
<i>Can't collect insurance.</i>

423
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,199
Back, back.

424
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,833
<i>There's glass there.</i>

425
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,317
Get that fridge, will you?

426
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,154
- Need any help?
- Not from you.

427
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,916
<i>You OK? It's not far.</i>

428
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,476
<i>It's just one more up.
The electric's off.</i>

429
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,791
<i>I don't mess with it.
Another convenience.</i>

430
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,475
But the icebox
will keep out the roaches.

431
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,519
<i>- Where'd you steal it?
- Been down there for weeks.</i>

432
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,718
<i>- I don't mean now. Before.
- Don't get a hernia.</i>

433
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,675
Just drop it anywhere.

434
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,678
Not bad, huh?

435
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,836
<i>There's no heat, but by winter,
I'll be in Florida.</i>

436
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,036
You want to stretch out?

437
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,673
Make yourself comfortable?

438
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,955
<i>OK... go ahead.
Why don't you take a nap?</i>

439
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,636
You like some coffee?

440
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,068
Joe, do you love me?

441
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,839
You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.

442
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,551
Joe, stop that!

443
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,318
<i>He's the one. The only one.</i>

444
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,676
<i>He's the one.
He's the only one.</i>

445
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:21,753
There have been
429 American casualties,

446
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,436
twenty-nine on the death list,
as opposed to 643...

447
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,718
Hey, why are you mad?

448
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,318
<i>- What's the matter?
- Where's my damn boots?</i>

449
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,319
Over there.

450
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,630
<i>- How'd they get off?
- I took 'em off.</i>

451
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,395
- What for?
- So you could sleep. Christ.

452
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,869
<i>- I should haul ass out of here.
- What's the matter now?</i>

453
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,191
You're after something.
What are you after?

454
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,230
<i>- Don't look like a fag.
- What's that mean?</i>

455
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,068
You want me to stay, right?

456
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,038
<i>I ain't forcing you.
Who's forcing you?</i>

457
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,635
<i>I'm truly sorry. Must've got
the wrong impression.</i>

458
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,830
OK. OK, boy.

459
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,392
I want you to stay.
I invited you, right?

460
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,871
<i>I hope you know what
you're in for. I'm dangerous.</i>

461
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,235
Someone does me bad...

462
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,394
<i>If I'd caught up to you
that night, you'd be dead.</i>

463
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,234
<i>- You hear?
- I'm impressed. You're a killer</i>

464
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,671
<i>I thought you should know,
that's all.</i>

465
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,470
Probably Y.M.C.A.
You make me want to puke, Ratso.

466
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,514
Joe, do me one favour.

467
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,353
- This is my place. Am I wrong?
- No.

468
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,989
<i>In my own place,
my name ain't Ratso.</i>

469
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,512
In my own place, my name
is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

470
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,318
<i>Can't say all that.</i>

471
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,635
Rico, then. At least
call me Rico in my own place.

472
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,836
OK. Rico, Rico, Rico.

473
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,310
<i>- Rico, Rico, Rico. That enough?
- That's fine.</i>

474
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,392
Give me one of those pillows.

475
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,717
<i>Don't touch my radio.</i>

476
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,312
Are you here again?
I told you to stay away!

477
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,632
- Every time, you take stuff!
- Stop picking on the cripple!

478
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,349
<i>- Cripple or not, I don't care!
- Goddamn it!</i>

479
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,394
The two basic items
necessary to sustain life...

480
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,199
are sunshine and coconut milk.

481
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,230
<i>You know that? That's a fact.</i>

482
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,676
<i>In Florida,
there's a lot of coconut trees.</i>

483
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,150
They even got 'em
in the gas stations.

484
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,191
And ladies! In Miami,
you got... You listening to me?

485
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,714
You got more ladies
than in any resort area.

486
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,078
<i>On a given day, there's
probably 300 on the beach.</i>

487
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,072
<i>You can't scratch yourself...</i>

488
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,232
<i>without gettin'
a bellybutton up the kazoo.</i>

489
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,470
<i>It's hot. Let's go.</i>

490
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,993
Come on!

491
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,392
Smells worse hot.

492
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,958
Then cook for yourself or get
a rich lady to cook for you.

493
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,508
<i>- I'm eatin' it.
- In her penthouse.</i>

494
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,558
<i>I'm eatin' it, Ratso. Good!</i>

495
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,396
<i>- It's good.
- Got to get out of here.</i>

496
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,040
Got to get out of here.

497
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,793
Anybody can score
in MiamiBeach, even you.

498
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,031
Nobody buys
that cowboy crap any more.

499
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,792
They're laughing at you.

500
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,750
<i>- Nobody's laughin'.
- I seen 'em laughin' at you.</i>

501
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,071
<i>When's the last time
you scored, boy?</i>

502
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,114
I only talk about that
in confession.

503
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,714
<i>When's the last time
you confessed?</i>

504
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,678
<i>That's between me
and my confessor.</i>

505
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,151
<i>You're beginning to smell.
For a stud, that's a handicap.</i>

506
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:25,713
<i>I ain't never seen you change
your underwear. That's weird.</i>

507
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,190
<i>I ain't got no need
to expose myself.</i>

508
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,469
<i>Bet you ain't never been laid,
and you tell me what women want!</i>

509
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,712
<i>I know that cowboy crap
don't appeal to nobody...</i>

510
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,030
except every 42nd Street Jackie.

511
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,270
<i>That's faggot stuff!</i>

512
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,557
<i>That's strictly for fags!</i>

513
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,110
<i>You gonna tell me
John Wayne's a fag?</i>

514
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,869
The way I look
makes me feel good.

515
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,788
<i>Women like me. Only thing
I ever been good for is lovin'.</i>

516
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,271
They're crazy for me.
They had to send Annie away.

517
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,875
<i>How come you ain't scored
this whole time?</i>

518
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,192
<i>'Cause I need management!
You stole $20 off of me!</i>

519
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,397
<i>Stop crappin' around
about Florida.</i>

520
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,836
Get your butt moving
and earn some management,

521
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,592
which you owe me!

522
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,238
<i>A woman in your condition
shouldn't have to do this.</i>

523
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,800
You have a lot of laundry!

524
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,755
<i>- It ain't right.
- What did it cost her?</i>

525
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,992
- What do you mean?
- The laundry lost some coins.

526
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,911
<i>- That's it.
- Take it.</i>

527
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,959
<i>That's good. Where's mine?
The black Homburg.</i>

528
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,273
<i>I don't know if your hat's here.
Bring me the ticket.</i>

529
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,989
What about that black Homburg?
Is that it?

530
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:54,116
<i>Ticket? Yeah, here's my ticket.
It's right there in the corner.</i>

531
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,274
- I'll look 'em over.
- Keep going. In the corner.

532
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,548
It not belong to you.
It belong to somebody else.

533
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,316
Bet you could
make a living at that.

534
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,394
And end up a hunchback
like my old man?

535
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:10,312
My dad spent 14 hours
a day in the subway.

536
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,188
<i>He'd come home
with two or three dollars.</i>

537
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,193
Coughed his lungs out
from breathing in that wax.

538
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,993
<i>Even the faggot undertaker
couldn't get his nails clean.</i>

539
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,196
Buried him with gloves on.

540
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,396
Go ahead. Take a look.

541
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,830
<i>Don't rush me.
Got to take your time.</i>

542
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,391
Get myself primed up for
some pretty little blond lady.

543
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,070
<i>When I'm feelin' good,
I spin around.</i>

544
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,914
There you are,
you handsome deviI!

545
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,072
Not bad. Not bad...

546
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,353
<i>...for a cowboy.</i>

547
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,633
You're OK.

548
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,753
You're OK.

549
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,393
Taxi!

550
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,038
You got something
on your shoulder. You got it.

551
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,599
Go ahead.

552
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,155
<i>You haven't got
a quarter, have you?</i>

553
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,156
- How do you like that?
- What you got?

554
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,152
I struck gold -
one high-class chick.

555
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,472
Barkley Hotel for Women. Women.

556
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,079
<i>Is this the gentlemen's
escort service?</i>

557
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,154
<i>I'm calling for Miss Beecham
at the Barkley Hotel.</i>

558
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,074
<i>She changed her mind.
She won't need nobody tonight.</i>

559
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,674
<i>That's right. Thanks. Bye.</i>

560
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,070
Would you believe a whole hotel
full of lonely ladies?

561
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,072
Score once,
and the way they talk,

562
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,118
I could open an office in there.

563
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,589
Go ahead. Get the money.

564
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,196
Listen, get the cash!
Remember the penthouse lady.

565
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,794
Those rich ladies
write a cheque,

566
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,838
and in the morning,
they stop payment.

567
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,754
Watch the car! Go on.

568
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,989
Rico! Up here! Up here!

569
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,354
B-6, G-49.

570
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,795
G-49.

571
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,118
L-24.

572
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,952
L-24.

573
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:48,956
And the next one is O-62,
ladies and gentlemen.

574
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,319
O-62. Are there any bingos?
The next one is B-13.

575
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,551
- How dare you!
- Wait a second, lady!

576
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,517
<i>Don't touch her!</i>

577
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,152
<i>It's 28 degrees,
and it's going down tonight.</i>

578
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,710
We can expect some
snow flurries later on.

579
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,120
I'll give you $5.00 for it.

580
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,039
Yeah.

581
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,639
I got a telephone
call from Jesus

582
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,393
I got him on the line

583
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,954
Got a telephone call from Jesus

584
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,634
I got him on the line

585
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,720
I want to show you something.

586
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,595
<i>There's money for you.</i>

587
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:22,148
<i>That's $9.00 plus assorted
change, minus 26 cents for milk.</i>

588
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,232
Plus five cents
for Dentyne. Gum.

589
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,315
<i>That's smart. Light a cigarette.</i>

590
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,680
Buy a carton. Do it right.

591
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,235
<i>- Where'd you get it?
- I got it.</i>

592
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,715
<i>Where you been, 42nd Street?
That's where you been.</i>

593
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,109
<i>- Movies, that's where you been.
- Ain't been nowhere.</i>

594
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,876
<i>- That's where you got that.
- What, this?</i>

595
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,714
- "What, this?"
- A friend give it to me.

596
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,631
- A friend.
- Yeah.

597
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:11,555
<i>Who'd you ever do
a favour for? You stole it.</i>

598
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,268
<i>It's for you.
It's too big for me.</i>

599
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,717
<i>- I wouldn't wear it.
- I'll be goddamned if I will.</i>

600
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,153
Here.

601
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,837
Buy some medicine
before you die.

602
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,594
<i>- I hate boneyards.
- He ain't your father.</i>

603
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,395
<i>He was dumber than you.
He couldn't write his own name.</i>

604
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,315
<i>"X", that's what it ought
to say on that headstone.</i>

605
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,076
Just like our dump,
condemned by order of City Hall.

606
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,076
<i>My grandma, Sally Buck... she
died without lettin' me know.</i>

607
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:28,039
They're stormtroopers!
They made me get out of the car.

608
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,556
It all depends
on what you believe in.

609
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:36,839
Sometimes your spirit goes up,
sometimes it goes other places.

610
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,039
How long did I hold up traffic?

611
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,239
Give someone power, and they'll
supercede their authority.

612
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,835
This kind of thing is spiritual.

613
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,798
<i>Now you're talkin' priest talk.</i>

614
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,553
<i>I'm talkin' about
what people believe.</i>

615
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,838
Some people believe you can
come back in another body.

616
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,152
<i>- Not in yours, I hope.
- I ain't askin' you to.</i>

617
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:08,758
You could come back as
anything - a dog or a president.

618
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,198
<i>If I had my choice,
I'd come back as the president.</i>

619
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,271
What do you think?

620
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:21,150
Maybe you got to think
about those things for a while.

621
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,916
<i>I'm usually a very calm person.
Forgive me, I'm awfully sorry.</i>

622
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,958
I'll write a letter
to the mayor.

623
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,189
You're entitled
to think what you want.

624
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,794
- Maybe I do.
- Him.

625
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,315
Maybe I do believe it.

626
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,399
And I'll...

627
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,475
<i>...do some thinkin' about it.</i>

628
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,837
- What was that all about?
- Lookee here.

629
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,150
I've been chosen for something.

630
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,079
- A come-on.
- A come-on to a party.

631
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,438
<i>Couple of whackos. Where do you
go, Klein's Bargain Basement?</i>

632
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,637
You go, you'll get
an encyclopaedia subscription.

633
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:16,555
Broadway and Harmony Lane.
Hansel and Gretel McAlbertson.

634
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,790
<i>- That's perfectly clear.
- Get out of here.</i>

635
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,589
What do whackos like that
want with us?

636
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,911
<i>It don't say nothin' about you.</i>

637
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,110
<i>- Nothin' about you, either.
- They took my picture.</i>

638
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,715
Want me to get lost?

639
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:41,909
<i>I didn't say nothin' about that.
Did I say that? Did I?</i>

640
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,312
<i>I'll tell 'em I don't go
nowhere without my buddy.</i>

641
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,040
<i>I ain't dressed for a party.</i>

642
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,036
There you go, right here.

643
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,359
Hey, dog.

644
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,633
You all right?

645
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,959
You OK?

646
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,631
You're sweating
all over the damn place.

647
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,719
Come here.

648
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,072
<i>- You got a comb?
- I don't need one.</i>

649
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,869
<i>Here. A few dozen cooties
won't kill me.</i>

650
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,351
- OK?
- Yeah.

651
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,351
- I look OK?
- Yeah.

652
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,596
OK, come on.

653
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,792
Take my picture.

654
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,508
One more close-up of her.

655
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,993
I love the theatre.
I want to die on the stage.

656
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:55,791
<i>My hair, it's fur. It's tendrils
reaching out into space.</i>

657
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,269
I've watched it touch stars.

658
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,112
They're all whackos.

659
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,919
<i>We better tell
somebody I'm here.</i>

660
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:12,268
- I made it. This is Ratso.
- Rico. Rico Rizzo.

661
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,035
<i>- Hello.
- There's beer behind me.</i>

662
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,713
Anything you want.

663
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,838
Oh, Jesus.

664
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,312
<i>Hansel's a fag, and Gretel's
got the hots for herself.</i>

665
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,311
Load up on salami.

666
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,914
<i>- It's like what?
- It's like heroin.</i>

667
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,073
<i>Death is like heroin,
and it's nothing.</i>

668
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,230
<i>It's like death. It's nothing.</i>

669
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,834
- Why are you here?
- I dunno.

670
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,232
<i>- Who brought you?
- I don't know.</i>

671
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,993
Thank you, ma'am.

672
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,628
<i>What you doin'?
She give it to me.</i>

673
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,119
Do you want up or down?

674
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,878
Why are you stealing food?

675
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,758
I noticed you're out of salami.

676
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,594
You should have someone go
to the delicatessen.

677
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,593
<i>You don't have
to steal it. It's free.</i>

678
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,912
<i>- Then I ain't stealing.
- How'd you get crippled?</i>

679
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,470
<i>- Slipped on a banana peel.
- What's the matter?</i>

680
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,597
- Get off me!
- Go use my shower.

681
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:56,037
<i>Go take a walk.
Don't touch me! Take a walk.</i>

682
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,395
Take a shave.

683
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,711
- Keep your hands off!
- You look hot!

684
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,997
- Guess who I am.
- Who?

685
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:09,232
<i>Me! How you doin'?
Gettin' your picture taken?</i>

686
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,358
Let's... leave now.

687
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,554
Your place... or mine?

688
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,274
<i>- She's hooked.
- Why, cowboy?</i>

689
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,148
- I'll expect 20 bucks.
- Why, cowboy whore?

690
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:52,792
<i>- Did you know we'd make it?
- You really mean business?</i>

691
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,954
<i>Who is he? Don't tell me
you two are a couple.</i>

692
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,071
Are you really a cowboy?

693
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:14,915
<i>I ain't a for-real cowboy,
but I'm a stud.</i>

694
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,151
<i>A very expensive stud.
I'm his manager.</i>

695
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,190
- How much will this cost me?
- Twenty bucks.

696
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,638
- OK.
- And taxifare.

697
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,280
Get lost, will you?

698
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,432
That'll cost
one buck taxifare.

699
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,832
- OK?
- Yeah, OK, OK.

700
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,198
Oh, boy.

701
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,879
Here.

702
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,357
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

703
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,558
<i>- I don't even know your name.
- My name's Joe.</i>

704
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,792
Oh, fabulous!
Joe could be anyone.

705
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,668
I like that.
"Come here, Joe. Kiss me, Joe".

706
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,593
<i>That's a good idea. Kiss me.</i>

707
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:17,872
Too much. He fell.
Hey, fella, you fell.

708
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,671
<i>- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's fine.</i>

709
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,799
<i>Why you hangin' on the banister?
Can't you walk?</i>

710
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,668
<i>- Naturally, I can walk.
- Yeah. He's got taxifare.</i>

711
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,753
- Come on.
- You sure you're all right?

712
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,397
<i>Well, it happens.
Don't worry about it.</i>

713
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:26,836
<i>It ain't never happened
to me before.</i>

714
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,152
<i>Bet your bottom dollar on that.
Where's the matches?</i>

715
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,913
Behind that thing.

716
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:49,868
<i>Maybe if you didn't call me
ma'am, it might work out better.</i>

717
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,918
<i>That's the first time
the thing ever quit.</i>

718
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:01,117
<i>That's a fact.
You think I'm lying to you?</i>

719
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,228
<i>No, I don't think you're lying.
I just had this funny image.</i>

720
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:13,074
I had an image of a policeman
without his stick...

721
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:18,757
and a bugler without his horn,
etcetera, etcetera.

722
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,677
<i>I'm making it worse.</i>

723
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,596
We should take a nap...

724
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,355
<i>...and see what happens.</i>

725
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,998
<i>I ain't sleepy.</i>

726
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,190
I know... Scribbage.

727
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,033
Shit!

728
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:20,510
<i>- Look at this here.
- There's an "E" in "money".</i>

729
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,469
<i>- I mean, if that's your word.
- That's how you spell it.</i>

730
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:29,872
<i>It's on that big building.
M-O-N-Y. Money.</i>

731
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:36,756
"Y". What starts with "Y"?

732
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:42,152
It can end in "Y".

733
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,750
Like "say", "pay..."

734
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,592
"Lay".

735
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,956
Hey, hey... "lay".

736
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,509
<i>You're teasing me
so I can't think.</i>

737
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,712
"Gay" ends in "Y".
You like that?

738
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:19,872
- Cut that out.
- Gay. Is that your problem?

739
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,676
I'll show you a problem.

740
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,668
<i>I'm not. I'm not exaggerating.</i>

741
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:44,915
You should try it.
It might be terrific for you.

742
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:51,469
<i>For God's sake! What night
is PhiI's poker night?</i>

743
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,039
Well, think!

744
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,356
Yeah, all right.

745
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,353
Joe, are you available
Thursday night? What time?

746
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:04,274
- Around 8.30?
- Let me think.

747
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:10,356
Thursday, 8.30. I guess
I can be available. Hell, yes!

748
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,310
<i>It's all set
for Thursday at 8.30.</i>

749
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,472
<i>I can't talk now.
Call me at the office.</i>

750
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,119
Yeah. Bye-bye.

751
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,157
Ma'am, I sure hate
to trouble you...

752
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,593
Sure.

753
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,399
<i>Twenty, wasn't it?</i>

754
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,879
Yes'm.

755
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,033
Bye.

756
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:07,479
Look right in there.
What do you see?

757
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,632
Try that on for size.

758
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:16,556
I got some aspirin,
Mentholatum, and all that crap.

759
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,357
<i>- Are they raw?
- No, but why'd you buy 'em?</i>

760
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:29,514
I could've lifted this.
Is that hot?

761
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,910
- You want some soup?
- Yeah.

762
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,630
<i>I'll get you some.
We ain't got to steal no more.</i>

763
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:42,999
I got eight bucks in my pockets
and 20 more come Thursday.

764
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,596
<i>- Give me some soup.
- What do you think I'm gettin'?</i>

765
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:50,319
<i>That's good healthy stuff.</i>

766
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,188
- Lookee there. Soup.
- Thank you.

767
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,952
<i>It's hot. Watch out.</i>

768
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,919
How was she?

769
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,994
- She went crazy.
- Yeah?

770
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:07,312
- She turned into an alley cat.
- Thanks for this stuff.

771
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,994
<i>- Don't mention it.
- It's good.</i>

772
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,791
<i>- Don't get sore.
- I ain't sore.</i>

773
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:23,319
<i>I can't walk any more.
I've been falling down.</i>

774
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,748
<i>I'm scared.</i>

775
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,236
What are you scared of?

776
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:38,190
<i>You know what they do when
they find out you can't walk.</i>

777
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,599
Oh, Christ.

778
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,598
I got to lay down.
I got to lay down.

779
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,070
Just take it easy.
I'll lay you down.

780
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:54,669
I'll lay you down.
There you go.

781
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:58,150
Put this over you.
Now, you stay here.

782
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,998
<i>- Where you goin'?
- To get a doctor.</i>

783
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,798
- What?
- A doctor.

784
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,270
<i>- Don't get me no doctor!
- You're sick.</i>

785
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:13,353
<i>No doctors. No cops.
Don't be so stupid.</i>

786
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,432
- What do you want?
- Florida.

787
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:20,229
<i>- I can't go.
- Put me on a bus.</i>

788
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:24,950
<i>- I don't need you.
- How will you get to Florida?</i>

789
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:30,398
<i>They'll only send me
to Bellevue. What're you doin'?</i>

790
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,916
- You're sick. Keep it on.
- Too hot now.

791
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,549
<i>Dumb. You're really dumb.
I don't need...</i>

792
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:40,552
- Shut up!
- Dumb cowboy.

793
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,154
Damn it! Shut up!

794
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,199
You got to pull
a damn stunt like this.

795
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,952
<i>Shirley, how you doin'?</i>

796
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,193
With who?

797
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,235
When will she be home?

798
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,913
<i>It's a good friend of hers.</i>

799
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,316
<i>It can't wait that long.</i>

800
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,038
Too bad. We all have off days.

801
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:38,271
<i>I'm Townsend P Lott
from Chicago. Call me Towny.</i>

802
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:42,273
<i>I'm here to have a little fun.</i>

803
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:47,598
<i>It's my first night.
Will you have dinner with me?</i>

804
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,912
<i>There's a French restaurant
not too far from here.</i>

805
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,193
<i>Don't worry about
how you're dressed.</i>

806
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:01,229
I'll tell them
you're with a rodeo.

807
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:04,153
Besides, you look very elegant.

808
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:08,472
<i>I'm expecting a telephone call
back at the hotel.</i>

809
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:13,717
Mama? A coincidence.
Guess who was being discussed.

810
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,476
<i>Is that thing turned up?
Why aren't you wearing it?</i>

811
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,233
Really, Mama,
this is impossible.

812
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,436
Why go to the expense?

813
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,351
Did I tell you
I got me a sick kid?

814
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:33,752
I got to get him south,
quick as I can.

815
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:39,470
<i>I got a sick boy,
and I'm gonna get him south.</i>

816
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,278
You understand me, Towny?

817
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:47,118
What you got me up here for?

818
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,948
<i>Joe, it's... it's so difficult.</i>

819
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,390
I should never
have asked you up here.

820
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,192
You're lovely, really.

821
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,312
Oh, God, I loathe life.

822
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:10,916
- Please go.
- You want me to leave?

823
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,079
No.

824
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:21,395
I mean yes. Please go.
Come back tomorrow. Promise?

825
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,836
<i>- I'm going to Florida tomorrow.
- That's terrible.</i>

826
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,038
You meet someone, you think...

827
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:33,193
I want to give you
something for your trip.

828
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,759
Please take it.

829
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,273
<i>Take it. You don't have
to be Catholic.</i>

830
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,796
<i>St Christopher's the patron
saint of all travellers.</i>

831
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,838
Take it...
for helping me be good.

832
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:56,040
- I got to have money.
- Yes, of course. Wait here.

833
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,393
I said wait.

834
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,354
<i>Here. Don't thank me.</i>

835
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:13,318
I need more than 10. I need $57.

836
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:16,392
<i>- I don't have it.
- I got family!</i>

837
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,597
<i>- There's nothing here.
- Out of my way.</i>

838
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,632
- Get out of my way!
- No, no...

839
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:30,511
Let go of that table,
please, sir.

840
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:36,550
Oh, I deserve it. I know I do.
My nose is bleeding.

841
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:42,795
You gonna let go of that table,
or you want a busted skull?

842
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,796
Joe... thank you.

843
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,349
Operator. Number, please.

844
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,637
- Number, please.
- Hello. Hello.

845
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,792
<i>- I wasn't calling anyone.
- Hello?</i>

846
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:04,838
<i>I wasn't calling anyone.</i>

847
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,599
<i>I wasn't calling anyone, Joe...</i>

848
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:26,349
31 hours. 11.30 in the morning,
we get there.

849
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:31,070
Not this morning,
but the next, at 11.30.

850
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,834
- These guys are good drivers.
- They got to be.

851
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:44,996
<i>You didn't kill him, did you?
There's blood on your jacket.</i>

852
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,592
<i>Don't talk about it.</i>

853
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:25,470
If you're shivering,
put your blankets up.

854
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,912
<i>I been thinkin'.</i>

855
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:36,553
<i>I hope we won't have any trouble
about my name down there.</i>

856
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,638
Keep your blankets on.

857
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:46,392
<i>Can you see this guy
runnin' around with a suntan,</i>

858
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:51,838
<i>goin' in swimmin', and then
somebody yells, "Hey, Ratso!"</i>

859
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,870
<i>What's that sound like?</i>

860
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,349
Sounds like they knew you.

861
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:03,479
<i>Sounds like crap.
I'm Rico all the time, OK?</i>

862
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,200
<i>We'll tell everyone
my name's Rico.</i>

863
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,351
- OK?
- OK.

864
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:53,596
<i>- What's the matter?
- I'm wet.</i>

865
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:58,196
- You're... you're what?
- I wet my pants.

866
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:02,995
Hell, no use crying
over the damn thing.

867
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:10,108
My leg hurts, my butt hurts,
my chest hurts, my face hurts.

868
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,909
Now I got to pee
all over myself.

869
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,790
<i>That's funny?
I'm fallin' apart here.</i>

870
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:22,558
You just took a little rest stop

871
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:25,313
<i>that wasn't on the schedule.</i>

872
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,756
I'll put you up here.

873
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:50,313
What size pants you wear?

874
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,272
Hi, honey.

875
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,990
- Where you from?
- New York.

876
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:30,829
<i>- Ever been here before?
- It's my first time.</i>

877
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,429
- Have a good time in Florida.
- Thanks.

878
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,917
<i>Hey... what are you doin'?</i>

879
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,389
<i>I'm zippin' your fly.</i>

880
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,870
- Thanks, Joe.
- These shirts are comfortable.

881
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:24,319
Yours was the last one
with a palm tree.

882
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,991
Clothes are cheap here.

883
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:41,398
All this only set us back ten.

884
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:48,835
You know, Ratso...
Rico, I mean...

885
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:51,434
I got this figured out.

886
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:57,789
<i>When we get to Miami, I'm gonna
get some sort of job, you know?</i>

887
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:03,000
<i>I ain't no hustler. There must
be easier ways to make money.</i>

888
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,712
Some sort of outdoors work.
What do you think?

889
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,832
<i>That's what I'll do.</i>

890
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,433
OK, Rico?

891
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,880
<i>Everything's fine.
Nothing to worry about.</i>

892
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,672
He kin to you?

893
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,959
- Want to close his eyes?
- What?

894
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,759
Just close his eyes.

895
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,034
Nothing else we can do.

896
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:36,870
Just a little illness.
We'll be in Miamisoon.

897
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,437
<i>Nothin' to worry about.
Just a little illness.</i>

898
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,512
