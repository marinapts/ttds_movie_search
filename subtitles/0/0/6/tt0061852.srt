1
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,120
Many strange legends are told
Of these jungles of India...

2
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,000
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.

3
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,560
It all began when the silence
Of the jungle was broken by
an unfamiliar sound.

4
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,360
It was a sound like one never heard
before in this part of the jungle.

5
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,600
It was a man cub!

6
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Had I known how deeply
I was to be involved...

7
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,920
I would've obeyed my
first impulse and walked away.

8
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,800
This man cub would have to
have nourishment, and soon.

9
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,080
It was many days travel
to the nearest man village...

10
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,280
and without a mother's care,
he would soon perish.

11
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,280
Then it occurred to me.

12
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,960
A family of wolves I knew
had been blessed with a litter of cubs.

13
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,440
Oh, I knew there'd be no problem
with the mother thanks to
the maternal instinct, but...

14
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,880
I wasn't so sure
about Rama, the father.

15
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,480
Ten times the rains
had come and gone.

16
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,960
And I often stopped by to see how Mowgli
the man cub was getting along.

17
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,320
He was a favorite of all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.

18
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,760
No man cub was
ever happier.

19
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,760
And yet, I knew
that someday...

20
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,280
he would have to go back
to his own kind.

21
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,640
Then one night, the wolf pack
elders met at council rock...

22
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,480
because Shere Khan
the tiger...

23
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
had returned to
their part of the jungle.

24
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,040
This meeting was to change
the man cub's entire future.

25
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,840
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him.

26
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,480
Now, are we all in agreement
as to what must be done?

27
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,680
Now it is my unpleasant duty
to tell the boy's father.

28
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,360
Rama. Uh, come
over here, please.

29
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,480
- Yes, Akela?
- The council has reached its decision.

30
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,040
The man cub can no longer
stay with the pack.

31
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,240
- He must leave at once.
- Leave?

32
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,760
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.

33
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,400
But-- But the man cub is--
Well, he's like my own son.

34
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,320
Surely he's entitled to
the protection of the pack.

35
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,800
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack
is no match for the tiger.

36
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,560
But the boy cannot survive
alone in the jungle.

37
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,800
Akela. Perhaps
I can be of help.

38
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,480
You, Bagheera? How?

39
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,680
I know of a man village
where he'll be safe.

40
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,280
Mowgli and I have taken many
walks into the jungle together,
so I'm sure he'll go with me.

41
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,280
So be it. Now there's
no time to lose. Good luck.

42
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,920
Bagheera.

43
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm getting a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we start back home?

44
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,640
Mowgli, this time
we're not going back.

45
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,040
- I'm taking you to a man village.
- But why?

46
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,520
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle.

47
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,760
And he has sworn
to kill you.

48
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,840
Kill me? But why would he
wanna do that?

49
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,880
He hates man.

50
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,000
And Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man--

51
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,120
just another hunter
with a gun.

52
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,680
Aw, we'll just explain to him that
I'd never do a thing like that.

53
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,640
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.

54
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,560
Well, maybe so.
But I'm not afraid.

55
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,560
- And besides, I--
- Now that's enough.

56
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,000
We'll spend the night here.
Things will look better in the morning.

57
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Man cub? Man cub!

58
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,320
Now come on, up this tree.
Be safer up there.

59
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,040
I don't wanna go back
to the man village.

60
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,280
Go on. Up you go.

61
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,480
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.

62
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,480
Is that all the better
you can climb?

63
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,200
I-- Oh-- It's
too big around.

64
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,080
And besides, I don't
have any claws.

65
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
Now, get some sleep.

66
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,640
We've got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow.

67
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
I-- I wanna stay
in the jungle.

68
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Huh? You wouldn't
last one day.

69
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,440
I'm not afraid. I-I can
look out for myself.

70
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,600
Say now, what have we here?

71
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,080
It's a man cub.

72
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,720
A delicious man cub.

73
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,280
Oh, go away and
leave me alone.

74
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,640
Oh, that's just what I
should do, but I'm not.

75
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,640
Now, now, please go
to sleep, man cub.

76
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,360
Yes, man cub.
Please go to sleep.

77
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,240
Please go to sleep

78
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,440
Sleep, little man cub

79
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
Rest in peace

80
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,200
Sleep. Sleep.

81
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,360
Ba-- Ba-Bagh-gheera.

82
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,400
Oh, now-- Now look, there's
no use arguing any more.

83
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,880
Oh! Now no more talk
till morning.

84
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,640
He won't be here
in the morning.

85
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,000
Hmm? Oh, yes, he will.
I-- Kaa!

86
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,920
Hold it, Kaa!

87
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,840
Oh! My sinus.

88
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,960
You have just made
a serious mistake, my friend.

89
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,800
A very stupid...

90
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,080
- Now, now, now, now, Kaa, I was--
- mistake.

91
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,720
Look me in the eye when
I'm speaking to you.

92
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,240
- Oh, please, Kaa.
- Both eyes, if you please.

93
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,760
You have just
sealed your doom.

94
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,360
Look, Bagheera!
Look, Bagheera.

95
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,440
Wake up, Bagheera.

96
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,920
Just you wait till
I get you in my coils.

97
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,920
Bagheera, he's got
a knot in his tail!

98
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,000
"He's got a knot
in his tail."

99
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,200
Ooh, this is going to
slow down my slither.

100
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,560
So, you can look out
For yourself, can you?

101
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,080
So you want to stay
in the jungle, do you?

102
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes. I wanna stay
in the jungle.

103
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,520
Oh! Now, now, now for
the last time, go to sleep!

104
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,800
Man cub.

105
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,720
Man cub.

106
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,600
Hup, two, three, four

107
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,320
Keep it up
Two, three, four

108
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,480
Hup, two, three, four

109
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,080
Keep it up
Two, three, four

110
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,960
Hup, two, three, four

111
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,160
A parade.

112
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,280
Oh, no!
The dawn patrol again.

113
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,600
Company, sound off!

114
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,360
Oh, the aim of our patrol
Is a question rather droll

115
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,200
For to march and drill
Over field and hill

116
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,720
Is a military goal

117
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,240
Is a military goal

118
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,480
With a hup
Two, three, four

119
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,920
Dress it up
two, three, four

120
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,280
By the ranks or single file

121
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,520
Over every jungle mile

122
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,360
Oh, west amp and crush
through the underbrush

123
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,920
In the military style

124
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,960
In the military style

125
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,880
Hello. What are you doing?

126
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,760
Shh! Drilling.

127
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,480
- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.

128
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,280
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.

129
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,720
To the rear! March!

130
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,480
The other way.
Turn around.

131
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
Hup, two, three, four

132
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,640
Keep it up
Two, three, four

133
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,280
To the rear! Ho!

134
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,800
Company, halt!

135
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,000
That means stop.

136
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
Company, left face!

137
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,840
March, march, march.
My feet are killing me.

138
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,440
I'm puttin' in for
a transfer to another herd.

139
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
Silence in the ranks!

140
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,200
Dress up that line.

141
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,280
Pull it in, Winifred.

142
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,560
Inspection! Arms!

143
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
Stick your nose out.

144
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,960
- Like this?
- That's right.

145
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
A dusty muzzle.

146
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,680
Soldier, remember, in battle,
that trunk can save your life.

147
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,320
- Take good care of it, my man.
- Yes, sir!

148
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
Very good. Cary on.

149
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,600
- Let's have a little more spit
and polish on those bayonets.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,600
Esprit de corps.

151
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,080
That's the way I earned my commission in
the Maharajah's fifth pachyderm brigade.

152
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Back in '88, it was.
Uh, or was it?

153
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,400
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.

154
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,200
It was then I received
the Victoria Cross...

155
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,880
for bravely  above and
beyond the call of duty.

156
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,800
Those were the days.

157
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,040
Discipline.
Discipline was the thing.

158
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,280
Builds character, and all that
sort of thing, you know.

159
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,840
Oh, oh, where was I?
Oh, yes. Inspection.

160
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,720
Well, very good.

161
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,720
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.

162
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
Eyes front.

163
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,240
Lieutenant, that haircut
is not regulation.

164
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,640
Rather on the gaudy side,
don't you think?

165
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,640
There. That's better.

166
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,960
And as for you--

167
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,480
Oh, there you are.

168
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,320
Let's keep those heels
together, shall we, son?

169
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,880
Okay, Pop. Sir.

170
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes, now that's better.

171
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,120
Well, a new recruit, eh?

172
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,160
I say, what happened
to your trunk?

173
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,080
Hey! Stop that!

174
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,520
A man cub!
Oh, this is treason!

175
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,760
Sabotage! I'll have
no man cub in my jungle!

176
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,760
-I-It's not your jungle!
-Hold it! Hold it! I can explain, Hathi.

177
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,320
Colonel Hathi,
If you please, sir.

178
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
Oh, yes, yes.
Colonel Hathi.

179
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,800
Uh, the man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man village.

180
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,360
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.

181
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,640
Good. And remember,
an elephant never forgets.

182
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,640
I don't know what the army's
coming to these days.

183
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,880
These young whippersnappers,
who do they think they are?

184
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,720
Let's get on with it!
Right face!

185
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,920
Forward march!

186
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,720
Dear, haven't you
forgotten something?

187
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,080
Nonsense, Winifred old girl.
An elephant never forgets.

188
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,600
Well, you just
forgot our son.

189
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,920
Uh, uh, son-- Son?

190
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,800
Son! Oh, yes, yeah, yeah!
Quite right.

191
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,760
To the rear! March!

192
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,680
When I grow up, I'm gonna be
a Colonel, just like my--

193
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,640
- If I've told you once, I've
told you a thousand times--
- Oh!

194
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,120
Pop! Look out!

195
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,640
Gee, Pop, you forgot
to say "halt."

196
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,040
He said an elephant
never forgets.

197
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,360
It's not funny.

198
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,560
Now let's get out of here quick
before anything else happens.

199
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,240
Bagheera!
Where are we goin'?

200
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
You're going back to
the man village right now.

201
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,440
- I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are!

202
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
I'm staying right here!

203
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,040
You're going if I have to
drag you every step of the way.

204
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,200
- Let go, you--
- You let go of me!

205
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,360
Oh, that does it.

206
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,120
I've had it, man cub!

207
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,160
From now on, you're
on your own alone!

208
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,640
Don't worry about me.

209
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,680
Foolish man cub.

210
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,560
Doo-bee doo-bee
doo-bee-dee-doo

211
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,840
Well, it'sa doo-bah-dee-doo
Yes, it'sa doo-bah-dee-doo

212
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,880
lmean a doo-bee doo-bee, doo-bee
doo-bee, doo-bee-dee-doo

213
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,720
And with--

214
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,680
Well, now.

215
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
What have we here?

216
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,320
Hey, what a funny
little bit of a--

217
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,560
- Oh!
- Go away!

218
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,520
Oh, boy, I've seen
everything in these woods.

219
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,560
Hoo! What have I run on?
What a pretty thing this is.

220
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,840
- Leave me alone.
- Well, now.

221
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,720
That's pretty big talk,
little britches.

222
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm big enough.

223
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,480
Pitiful. Hey, kid,
you need help.

224
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,200
And old Baloo's gonna learn you
to fight like a bear.

225
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,120
Now come on,
I'm gonna show you.

226
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,880
Yeah!

227
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,520
All right, now, kid, loosen up.
Get real loose and then start to weave.

228
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,920
Weave a little.
Now move! That's it!

229
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,760
Now give me a big bear growl.
Scare me.

230
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,480
Oh, boy.

231
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,440
I'm talkin' about
like a big bear.

232
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,640
He's in trouble! Why, I-I
shouldn't have left him alone.

233
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,160
- A big one. Right from your toes.
- How's that?

234
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,720
- Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid.
- Oh, no! It's Baloo.

235
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,960
That shiftless,
stupid jungle bum.

236
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,560
Weave about now and
look for an opening.

237
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
Keep movin'. Keep--

238
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,520
Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid.
Come on, that's it.

239
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,760
He's a dandy.

240
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,760
Fine teacher you are,
old iron paws.

241
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,480
- Oh, thanks, Bagheera.
- Eh, tell me, tell me, uh...

242
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,480
after you knock your pupil
senseless, uh, how do you expect
him to remember the lesson? Hmm?

243
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,240
Well, I-- I, uh-- Well, I didn't
mean to lay it on him so hard.

244
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,200
I'm not hurt.
I'm all right.

245
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,360
I'm a lot tougher than
some people think.

246
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,440
You better believe it.

247
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,840
Now let's go once more.
Now I want you to keep circlin'
or I'm gonna knoc kyour roof in again.

248
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,760
You better keep movin'.

249
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,640
Hey! Right on the button.

250
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,680
No, no-no, no-no.
Now you're ticklin'.

251
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,440
No! No. N-N-Now, now we don't
do that here in the jungle.

252
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,160
No, you're ticklin'.
I-I can't stand that ticklin'.

253
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,560
- Help, Bagheera!
- Oh, boy, that's all he needs.
More confidence.

254
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,880
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya.

255
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
Ooh! I give-- Hey!

256
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,040
You know somethin'? You're all right,
kid. What do they call you?

257
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,080
Mowgli. And he's going back
to the man village right now.

258
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,880
Man village? They'll ruin him.
They'll make a man out of him.

259
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,640
Oh, Baloo, I wanna
stay here with you.

260
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,680
Certainly you do.

261
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,040
Oh? And just how do you
think he will survive?

262
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,400
"How do you think he will--" What do
you mean, "How do you think he--"

263
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,560
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.

264
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,800
Well, that shouldn't
take too long.

265
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,760
Look, now it's like this,
little britches.

266
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,640
All you've gotta do is--

267
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Look forthe bare necessities
The simple bare necessities

268
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,560
Forget about your worries
And your strife

269
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,480
I mean the bare necessities
are Mother Nature's recipes

270
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,560
That bring the bare
necessities of life

271
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,040
Wherever I wander
Wherever I roam

272
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,560
I couldn't be fonder
Of my big home

273
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,520
The bee sare buzzin' in the tree
to make some honey just for me

274
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,000
When you look under
the rocks and plants

275
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,040
And take a glance
at the fancy ants

276
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,960
Then maybe try a few

277
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,400
You eat ants?

278
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,720
You better believe it. And you're
gonna love the way they tickle.

279
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
Mowgli, look out!

280
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,120
- The bare necessities
of life will come to you
- But when?

281
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,400
They'll come to you

282
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,600
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities

283
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,320
Forget about your worries
And your strife

284
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,160
I mean the bare necessities

285
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,440
That's why a bear
can rest at ease

286
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,360
With just the bare necessities
Of life

287
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,600
Now when you pick a paw paw

288
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,880
- Or a prickly pear
- Ow!

289
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,280
And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time, beware

290
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,480
Don't pick the prickly pear
By the paw

291
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,200
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw

292
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,360
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big paw paw

293
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,080
- Have I given you a clue?
- Golly. Thanks, Baloo.

294
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,000
Pawpaw.

295
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,280
Of all the silly gibberish.

296
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Come on, Baghee,
get with the beat.

297
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,880
- The bare necessities
of life will come to you
- They'll come to me!

298
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,400
They'll come to you

299
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,280
How 'bout scratchin' that ol' left
shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?

300
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,360
Now just a hair lower.
There. Right there. That's it.

301
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,640
Oh! This is beautiful.

302
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,680
That's good.
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin'.

303
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,600
You're lots of fun, Baloo.

304
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,560
Right on it. Yeah!

305
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,080
That's delicious.

306
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,960
Just a little bit--

307
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,880
Yeah!

308
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,680
Yeah.

309
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,080
Oh, man, this is
really livin'.

310
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,320
So just try and relax.

311
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,760
Yeah. Cool it.

312
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,400
Fall apart in my backyard.

313
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,120
'Cause let me tell you somethin',
little britches.

314
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,680
If you act like
that bee acts...

315
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,880
uh-uh, you're
workin' too hard.

316
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,680
And don't spend your time
lookin' around...

317
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,640
for something you want
that can't be found.

318
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,000
When you find out you can live without
it and go along not thinkin' about it

319
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,040
I'll tell you somethin' true

320
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,840
The bare necessities
Of life will come to you

321
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,520
I give up. Well, I hope
his luck holds out.

322
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,160
Mowgli, how 'bout you sing?

323
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,320
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities

324
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,160
- Forget about your worries
and your strife
- Yeah, man.

325
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,960
I mean the bare necessities

326
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,240
That's why a bear
can rest at ease

327
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,920
With just the bare necessities
Of life

328
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,720
- Yeah!
- With just the bare necessities of life

329
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,640
Yeah, man!

330
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,680
Beautiful!
That's real jungle harmony.

331
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,000
- I like being a bear.
- That's my boy.

332
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,640
And you're gonna make one swell bear.
Why, you even sing like one.

333
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,480
Hey, Mowgli, how 'bout you
flickin' that old, mean fly...

334
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,680
of fo' your
papa bear's nose?

335
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,280
Ouch!

336
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,400
Boy, when you flick a fly,
you really--

337
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,960
Why you flat-nosed,
little-eyed, flaky creep!

338
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,200
Hey! Let go of me!

339
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,080
Take your flea-pickin' hands
Of fo' my cub!

340
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,000
Come on and get him, champ!

341
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,400
- He ain't no champ. He's a chump!
- Baloo!

342
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,360
Yeah! A big hothead!

343
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,760
Okay, you guys asked for it.
I'll--

344
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,680
That'll cool him off.

345
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,920
Gimme back my man cub!

346
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,360
Here he is.
Come and get him!

347
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
That's how a bear
can rest at ease.

348
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,280
Here's some bare necessities.

349
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,040
Now just try that again, you--

350
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,480
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity.

351
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,120
Look, monk, you turn him loose
or I'll jerk a knot in your tail--

352
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,040
We give up!
Here he comes!

353
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,160
Baloo! Catch me!

354
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,800
- Baloo!
- Back up! Back up!
Faster! Faster! Faster!

355
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,240
A rolling bear
gathers no hair!

356
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,680
Baloo! Help me!
Baloo, they're carrying me away!

357
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,360
Bagheera!

358
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,080
Bagheera!

359
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,360
Well, it's happened.

360
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,680
Took a little longer than I thought,
but it's happened.

361
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,840
Bagheera!

362
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,600
Oh, you heard me, huh?

363
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,000
Mowgli. Mowgli!

364
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,880
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?

365
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,960
They ambushed me.
Thousands of'em.

366
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,680
I jabbed with my left. Then I swung
with a right. And then I let--

367
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,680
Oh, for the last time,
what happened to Mowgli?

368
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,600
Like I told ya, them
mangy monkeys carried him off.

369
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,960
The ancient ruins.
Oh, I hate to think what'll happen
when he meets that king of theirs.

370
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,920
- We got him, King Louie!
- Here he is. Man, we got him.
We got him!

371
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,320
So you're the man cub.
Crazy.

372
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,920
I'm not as crazy as you are.
Put me down!

373
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
You cut that out!

374
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,520
Cool it, boy.
Unwind yourself.

375
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,360
Now come on,
let's shake, cousin.

376
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,520
What do you want me for?

377
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,560
Word has grabbed my royal ear--
Have a banana--

378
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,120
that you wanna
stay in the jungle.

379
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,000
Stay in the jungle?
I sure do.

380
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,720
Well, good.
And old King Louie--

381
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,360
That's me--
can fix it for you.

382
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,840
Have two bananas.

383
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
- Have we got a deal?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,600
I'll do-- I'll do anything
to stay in the jungle.

385
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,160
Well, then.

386
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,160
I'll lay it on
the line for you.

387
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,000
Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VlP

388
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,240
I've reached the top
And had to stop

389
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,720
And that's what's botherin' me

390
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,400
I wanna be a man, man cub
And stroll right into town

391
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,560
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around

392
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Oh, ooh-bee-doo

393
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,520
I wanna be likeyou

394
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,160
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you too

395
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,720
You see it's true

396
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,360
An ape like me

397
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,840
Can learn to be human too

398
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,840
What?

399
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Gee, Cousin Louie,
you're doin' real good.

400
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,240
Now here's your part
Of the deal, cuz.

401
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,920
Lay the secret on me
of man's red fire.

402
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,160
But I don't know
how to make fire.

403
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,800
Now don't try to kid me, man cub
I made a deal with you

404
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,280
What I desire
Is man's red fire

405
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
To make my dream come true

406
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,240
Now give me the secret, man cub
Come on, clue me what to do

407
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,680
Give me the power
Of man's red flower

408
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,720
So I can be like you

409
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,520
Fire? So that's what
that scoundrel's after.

410
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,600
I'll tear him limb from limb.
I'll beat him.

411
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,680
I'll-- I'll--

412
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,520
Yeah!

413
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,680
Well, man, what a beat.

414
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,600
Will you stop that silly
beat business and listen?

415
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,680
This will take brains,
not brawn.

416
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,120
You better believe it,
and I'm loaded with both.

417
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,160
- Will you listen?
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.

418
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,520
Now, while you
create a disturbance...

419
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,400
I'll rescue Mowgli.
Got that?

420
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,800
I'm gone, man. Solid gone.

421
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,440
Not yet, Baloo!

422
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,360
Hey!

423
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,920
Get mad, baby.

424
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,200
You
l wanna be like you

425
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,040
l wanna walk like you
Talk like you too

426
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,320
You see it's true

427
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,240
Someone like me

428
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,200
Can learn to be
Like someone like me

429
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,120
Take me home, daddy!

430
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,320
Can learn to be
Like someone like you

431
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,040
- One more time!
- Yeah, can learn to be

432
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,080
Like someone like me

433
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,240
- Man!
- It's Baloo, the bear!

434
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,960
Yeah, that's him!
How'd that square get in there?

435
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,880
Baloo, it's you!

436
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,080
Man, that's what I call
a swingin' party.

437
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,880
And furthermore, Baloo...

438
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,120
Mowgli seems to have man's
ability to get into trouble.

439
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,040
And your influence
hasn't been exactly--

440
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,000
Shh. Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.

441
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,600
- Dah.
- Well, he's had a big day.

442
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,720
It was a real sockaroo.

443
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,600
You know, it ain't easy
learnin' to be like me.

444
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,320
Pah!
A disgraceful performance.

445
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,040
Associating with those undesirable,
scatterbrained apes.

446
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,120
Unh. I hope Mowgli learned
something from that experience.

447
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,800
Scooby-dooby,
dooby-doo.

448
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,080
That's my boy.

449
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,440
Oh, nonsense.

450
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,520
Baloo.

451
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,400
Over here. I'd like
to have a word with you.

452
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,800
A word? You gonna
talk some more?

453
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,160
All right,
what's up, Bagheera?

454
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,520
Baloo...

455
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,760
the man cub must go back
to the man village.

456
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,400
The jungle is not
the place for him.

457
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,160
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.

458
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,680
Yes, just look at yourself.

459
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,720
Look at that eye.

460
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,400
Yeah. It's beautiful,
ain't it?

461
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Yeah. Frankly, you're
a disreputable sight.

462
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,360
Well, you don't look exactly
like a basket off ruit yourself.

463
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,400
Ohh.

464
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,520
Baloo, you can't adopt
Mowgli as your son.

465
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,200
Why not?

466
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,880
H-H-How can I put it?
It-- Baloo...

467
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,600
birds of a feather
should flock together.

468
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,680
You wouldn't marry
a panther, would you?

469
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,200
I don't know.

470
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,640
Come to think of it,
no panther ever asked me.

471
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,400
No. Baloo, you-you've got
to be serious about this.

472
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,000
Oh, stop woryin', Baghee.
Stop woryin'.

473
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,920
I'll take care of him.

474
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,920
Yes. Like you did when
the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?

475
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,680
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.

476
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,600
And another thing.

477
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,400
Sooner or later, Mowgli
will meet Shere Khan.

478
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,960
The tiger? What's he got
against the kid?

479
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,480
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.

480
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,480
Because he fears man's gun
and man's fire.

481
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,080
But little Mowgli
don't have those things.

482
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,960
Shere Khan won't wait
until he does.

483
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,480
He'll get Mowgli while
he's young and helpless.

484
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,600
-Just one swipe and--
- No.

485
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,120
Well-- Well, what
are we gonna do?

486
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,080
- We'll do what's best for the boy.
- You better believe it.

487
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,800
You name it,
and I'll do it.

488
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,520
Good. Then make Mowgli
go to the man village.

489
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,760
Are you out of your mind?
I promised him...

490
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,680
he could stay here
in the jungle with me.

491
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,400
Well, that's just the point.
As long as he remains with you...

492
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,960
he's in danger,
so it's up to you.

493
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,520
- Why me?
- Be-Be-Because he won't listen to me.

494
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,360
I love that kid.

495
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,320
I love him like
he was my own cub.

496
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,800
Then think of what's best
for Mowgli and not yourself.

497
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,520
Uh, well, can't-- Well,
can't I wait until morning?

498
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,440
It's morning now.

499
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,240
Go on, Baloo.

500
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,120
Uh--

501
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,120
Oh, boy.

502
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,880
Mowgli. Mowgli.

503
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,360
Uh, it's time to get up.

504
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,240
Oh. Hi, Baloo.

505
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,000
Hi. Hey, rub that old
sleep out of your eyes.

506
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,360
You and me, uh, we got
a long walk ahead of us.

507
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,600
Swell. Gee, we'll have
lots of fun together.

508
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,240
Sure. Yeah.
Yeah. Uh--

509
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,080
All right, let's
hit the trail, kid.

510
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,320
See ya around,
uh, Bagheera.

511
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,280
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.

512
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,320
Me and Baloo,
we've got things to do.

513
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,600
Goodbye, man cub.
And good luck.

514
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is--

515
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,480
Look for the bare necessities

516
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,720
Some good old bare necessities

517
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,680
Forget about your worries
And your strife

518
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,440
l mean the bare necessities

519
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,640
That's why a bear
can rest at ease

520
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,360
With just the bare
necessities of life

521
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,080
Yeah I'll live here
in the jungle

522
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,800
All my life
Yeah, man

523
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,440
I like bein' a bear.

524
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,800
- Where we goin', Baloo?
- Well, uh, it's, uh--

525
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,520
Um, well, it's
sort of new and, uh--

526
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,280
Oh, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.

527
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,280
Mowgli, uh,
look, buddy, uh...

528
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,360
there's somethin'
I gotta tell ya.

529
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,720
Tell me what, Baloo?

530
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,640
Gee whiz.

531
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,880
Now how did old Baghee
put it? It's, uh--

532
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,560
Uh, uh, Mowgli?

533
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,600
Ha! You wouldn't marry
a panther, would you?

534
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,440
Gee, I don't even know
what you're talkin' about.

535
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,760
Mowgli, don't you realize
that you're a human?

536
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,840
I'm not any more, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.

537
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,640
Little buddy, look,
listen to me.

538
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,680
- Come on. Come on, Baloo.
- Now, Mowgli, stop it now.

539
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,200
Now hold still. I-I want
to tell you something.

540
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,160
Now listen to me.

541
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,720
- What's the matter, old Papa Bear?
- Look, Mowgli...

542
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,520
I been tyin' to tell ya.
I been tyin' all morning to tell ya.

543
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,840
I've got to take you
back to the man village.

544
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,880
- The man village!
- Now look, kid...

545
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,680
- I can explain, and--
- But, but you said we were partners.

546
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,200
- Now believe me, kid, I-I-I--
- You're just like, like old Bagheera!

547
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,560
Now just a minute.
That's goin' too far.

548
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,840
Hey, Mowgli,
where you goin'?

549
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,160
Wait a minute! Stop!

550
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,400
Wait!

551
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,120
Wait! Listen to old Baloo.

552
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,760
Mowgli. Mowgli!

553
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,960
Mowgli!

554
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,120
- Mowgli. Mowgli!
- Now what's happened?

555
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,760
Well, you, you, you're not
gonna believe me, Bagheera...

556
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,000
but look, now I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me.

557
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,960
Well, don't just stand there.

558
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,320
Let's separate.
We-- We've got to find him.

559
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,520
Oh, if anything happens
to that little guy...

560
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,240
I'll never forgive myself.

561
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,240
I gotta find him.
Mowgli!

562
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,680
Mowgli.

563
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,040
Hup, two, three, four

564
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,160
Hup, two, three, four

565
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,200
Keep it up
Two, three

566
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,640
What beastly luck.

567
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,360
Confound that ridiculous
Colonel Hathi.

568
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,960
Company, sound off.

569
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,160
Oh, we march from here to there

570
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,720
And it doesn't matter where

571
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,280
You can hear us push
through the deepest bush

572
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,400
Hup, two, three, four

573
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,840
With a military air

574
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,560
With a military air

575
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,440
The jungle patrol.

576
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,880
We're a cracker jack brigade

577
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,200
On a pachyderm parade

578
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,080
But we'd rather stroll
to a waterhole

579
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,080
Hup, two, three, four

580
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,600
For a furlough in the shade

581
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,400
Stop! W-Wait a minute.

582
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,520
Halt!

583
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,720
Who said halt?
I give the commands around here.

584
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,840
- Now speak up. Who was it?
- Oh, it was me, Colonel.

585
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,080
What do you mean, sir,
taking over my command?

586
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,040
- Highly irregular, you know.
- Oh, Colonel, I-I'm sorry...

587
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,560
- but, but I need your help.
- Oh, absolutely impossible.

588
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,080
- We're on a cross-county march.
- But it's an emergency, Colonel.

589
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,840
- The man cub must be found.
- Man cub? What man cub?

590
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,840
-How interesting.
-The one I was taking to the man village.

591
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,200
Good.
That's where he belongs.

592
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,120
Now, sir,
If you don't mind...

593
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,040
we'd like to get on
with the march.

594
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,480
No, no, no, you,
you don't understand, Hathi.

595
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,960
He is lost.
He ran away.

596
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,120
How delightful.

597
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,440
Well, serves the young
whippersnapper right.

598
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,320
But, but Shere Khan,
the tiger--

599
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,840
He's sure to pick up
the man cub's trail.

600
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,040
Shere Khan.
Nonsense, old boy.

601
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,960
Shere Khan isn't
within miles of here.

602
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,880
Oh, sorry, Bagheera.

603
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,080
Fortunes of war, and all that
sort of thing, you know.

604
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,080
This has gone far enough.
Far enough.

605
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,760
Now just a minute,
you pompous old windbag.

606
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,280
Winifred! What are you
doing out of ranks?

607
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,280
Never mind.

608
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,360
How would you like
to have our boy...

609
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,600
lost and alone
in the jungle?

610
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,880
Our son? W-Well--

611
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,160
But, Winifred old girl,
that's an entirely different matter.

612
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,960
- Huh!
- Different, entirely.

613
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,520
That little boy is no different
than our own son.

614
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,160
Now you help find him,
or I'm taking over command.

615
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,880
What! A female
leading my herd?

616
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,680
Utterly preposterous.

617
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,720
Pop? The man cub and I
are friends.

618
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,440
He'll get hurt
If we don't find him.

619
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,040
Please, Pop? Sir?
Please?

620
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,920
Now don't you worry, son.

621
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,480
Your father had a plan
in mind all the time.

622
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,240
Sure you did.

623
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,880
Troopers!
Company, left face!

624
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,800
Volunteers for
a special mission...

625
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,760
will step
one pace forward.

626
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,400
That's what I like to see.
Devotion to duty.

627
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,920
Now, you volunteers
will find the lost man cub.

628
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
Now there's no time to lose.

629
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,640
Yes, yes.
Well, bugler.

630
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,560
When the man cub is sighted,
you will sound your trumpet...

631
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,760
- three times.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,080
Not now, soldier.

633
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,280
Sorry, sir.

634
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,240
Lieutenant, our strategy shall
be the element of surprise.

635
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,040
You will take one squad...

636
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,440
- and cover the right flank.
- Yes, sir.

637
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,800
And I shall lead
the other squad...

638
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,160
on the left flank.

639
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,720
Very well. Company...

640
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,800
forward march!

641
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Element of surprise?

642
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,120
Oh, I say.

643
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,200
And now for my rendezvous
with the little lost man cub.

644
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,880
Kaa! It's you!

645
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,360
Yes, man cub.

646
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,120
So nice to see you again.

647
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,120
Oh, go away.
Leave me alone.

648
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,040
Let me look at you.

649
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,760
You don't want me
to look at you?

650
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,640
Then you look at me.

651
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,680
No, sir. I know what
you're tryin' to do, Kaa--

652
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,480
You do? Uh, I mean...

653
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,280
- you don't trust me.
- No.

654
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,120
Then there's nothing
I can do to help.

655
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,040
You wanna help me?

656
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,280
Certainly.

657
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,240
I can see to it that you never
have to leave this jungle.

658
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,120
How could you do that?

659
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,120
Hmm? Oh, I have my own...

660
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,960
subtle little ways.

661
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,720
But first,
you must trust me.

662
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,720
I don't trust
anyone any more.

663
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,480
I don't blame you.

664
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,760
I'm not like
those so-called...

665
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,920
fair-weather friends
of yours.

666
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,120
You can believe in me.

667
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,000
Trust in me

668
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,720
Just in me

669
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,840
Shut your eyes

670
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,440
And trust in me

671
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,880
Hold still, please.

672
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,240
You can sleep

673
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,120
Safe and sound

674
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,720
Knowing I

675
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,400
Am around

676
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,880
Slip into silent slumber

677
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,560
Sail on a silver mist

678
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,880
Slow Iy and sure lyyoursenses

679
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,760
Will cease to resist

680
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,720
You're snoring.

681
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,360
Sorry.

682
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,520
Trust in me

683
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,800
And just in me

684
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,800
Shut your eyes

685
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,280
And trust in me

686
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,120
Oh, now what?

687
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,040
I'll be right down.

688
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,960
Yes? Yes?
Who is it?

689
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,440
It's me, Shere Khan.

690
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,960
I'd like a word with you
If you don't mind.

691
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,600
Shere Khan.

692
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,880
What a surprise.

693
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,200
Yes, isn't it?

694
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,440
I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.

695
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,440
Oh, no, no,
nothing at all.

696
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,400
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.

697
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,880
Coils? Someone?
Oh, no.

698
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,680
I was just curling up
for my siesta.

699
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,480
But you were singing to someone.
Who is it, Kaa?

700
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,040
Uh, who? Oh, no.

701
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,720
Well, I was just singing,
uh, to myself.

702
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,320
- Indeed.
- Yes. Yes, you see...

703
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,280
I have trouble
with my sinuses.

704
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,480
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.

705
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,560
It's simply terrible.

706
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,520
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

707
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,160
So I sing myself to sleep.

708
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,520
You know, self-hypnosis.

709
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,840
Let me show you
how it works.

710
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,240
Ah, trust in me

711
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,320
No, I can't be bothered with that. I
have no time for that sort of nonsense.

712
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,680
Some other time perhaps?

713
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,440
Perhaps. But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.

714
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,080
Man cub? What man cub?

715
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,240
The one who's lost.

716
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,880
Now where do you suppose
he could be?

717
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,120
- Search me.
- That's an excellent idea.

718
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,760
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me
your coils, would you, Kaa?

719
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,880
Uh, certainly not.

720
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,520
Nothing here.

721
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,720
And nothing in here.

722
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,560
My sinuses.

723
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,120
Hmm. Indeed.

724
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,320
And now, how about
the middle?

725
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,400
The middle?

726
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,400
Oh, the middle.

727
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,040
Absolutely nothing
in the middle.

728
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,360
Really?

729
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,760
Well, if you do just happen
to see the man cub...

730
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,680
you will inform me first,
understand?

731
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,960
I get the point.
Cross my heart, hope to die.

732
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,200
Good show.

733
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,040
And now I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.

734
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,840
Ooh, who does he think
he's fooling?

735
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,760
"The helpless little lad."

736
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,440
Ooh, he gives me
the shivers.

737
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,480
Picking on that poor
little helpless boy.

738
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,280
Oh, yes.

739
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,160
Poor little helpless boy.

740
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,520
You told me a lie, Kaa.

741
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,440
You said
I could trust you.

742
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,080
It's like you said.

743
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,240
You can't trust anyone.

744
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,280
If I never see that
skinny little shrimp again...

745
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,520
it will be too soon.

746
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,080
Ooh, my sacroiliac.

747
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,200
Hey, Flaps,
what we gonna do?

748
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,240
I don't know.
What you wanna do?

749
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,000
I've got it! Let's flap over
to the east side of the jungle.

750
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,720
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin' scene all right.

751
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,960
Ah, come off it.
Things are right dead all over.

752
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,520
You mean you wish they were.

753
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,040
Very funny.

754
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,640
Okay.
So what we gonna do?

755
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,680
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?

756
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,440
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"

757
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,360
Then you say, "I don't know.
What you wanna do?"

758
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,280
Then I say, "What we gonna do?"
You say, "What you wanna do?"

759
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,720
"What we gonna do?" "What you
want--" Let's do something!

760
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,480
Okay. What you wanna do?

761
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,440
Blimey. There you go again.
The same notes again.

762
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,040
I've got it! This time
I've really got it.

763
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,640
So you've got it.
Then what we gonna do?

764
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,880
Hold it, lads. Look.
Look what's coming our way.

765
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,760
Hey, what in the world
is that?

766
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,640
What a crazy-looking
bunch of bones.

767
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,600
Yeah, and they're all
walkin' about by themselves.

768
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,360
Yeah.

769
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,840
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

770
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,840
Hey, now don't
start that again!

771
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,560
Come on, lads. Come on. Let's have
some fun with this little fella...

772
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,680
this little blokey.

773
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,680
Blimey. He's got legs
like a stork, he has.

774
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,400
Like a stork. But he ain't
got no feathers, he ain't.

775
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,280
Go ahead. Laugh.
I don't care.

776
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,440
- What's wrong with him?
- I think we overdid it.

777
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,240
We were just having a bit
Of fun, that's all.

778
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,440
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.

779
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,160
You know, he must be
down on his luck.

780
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,920
Yeah, or he wouldn't be
in our neighbourhood.

781
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,120
Hey, new kid,
wait a minute! Hey!

782
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,320
-Just leave me alone.
- Oh, come on. What's wrong?

783
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,080
You know, you look like you
haven't got a friend in the world.

784
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,520
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?

785
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,040
No.
Nobody wants me around.

786
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,840
Yeah, we know
how you feel.

787
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,080
Nobody wants us
around either.

788
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,440
Ah, we may look a bit shabby,
but we've got heart.

789
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,840
And feelings too.

790
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,840
And just to prove it to you, we're gonna
let you join our little group.

791
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,920
Kid, we'd like to make you
an honouray vulture.

792
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,000
Thanks, but I-- I'd rather
be on my own, alone.

793
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,920
Aw, now look, kid.

794
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,840
Eveybody's got to have friends.

795
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,480
Hey, fellas,
are we his friends?

796
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,200
We'reyourfriends

797
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,280
We're your friends

798
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,880
We're your friends
to the bitterend

799
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,280
The bitterend

800
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,600
When you're alone

801
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,680
When you're alone

802
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,600
Who comes around

803
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,480
Who comes around

804
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:25,320
- To pluck you up
- To pluck you up
- Give us a smile.

805
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,320
When you are down

806
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:32,480
When you are down

807
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,560
And when you're
outside lookin' in

808
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,320
- Who's there to open the door
- Come on, kid. We need a tenor.

809
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:49,720
- That's what
- What friends are for

810
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,480
Who's always eager to extend

811
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,480
A friendly claw

812
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,120
That's what friends are for

813
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,600
And when you're lost
in dire need

814
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,520
Who's at your side
at lightning speed

815
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,000
We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike

816
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,520
In fact we've never met
an animal we didn't like

817
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,440
Ha-ha. You take it, kid.

818
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:25,440
Didn't like

819
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,280
So you can see we're friends

820
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,200
- We're friends in need
- We're friends in need

821
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,120
-And friends in need
- Friends in need

822
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,920
-Are friends indeed
-Are friends indeed

823
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,960
- Whoop, whoop.
Take it easy, lads.
- We'll keep you safe

824
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,560
- Steady, steady. Watch it!
- In the jungle

825
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:45,000
Forevermore

826
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:50,480
That's what friends

827
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:56,920
Are for

828
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,520
Bravo, bravo.

829
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,160
An extraordinary performance.

830
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,880
And thank you for
detaining my victim.

831
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,040
Uh, do-don't mention it,
Your Highness.

832
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,360
- Boo.
- Let's get out of here.

833
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,800
Give me room!
Gangway!

834
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,760
Run, friend! Run!

835
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,880
Run? Why should I run?

836
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,800
Why should you run?

837
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,000
Could it be possible that
you don't know who I am?

838
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,040
I know you, all right.
You're Shere Khan.

839
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,920
Precisely.
Then you should also know...

840
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,880
that everyone runs
from Shere Khan.

841
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,080
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.

842
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,080
Ah. You have spirit
for one so small.

843
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,840
And such spirit is deserving
Of a sporting chance.

844
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,720
Now, I'm going to close my eyes
and count to ten.

845
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,440
It makes the chase
more interesting...

846
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,360
for me.

847
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,960
One, two...

848
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,360
three...

849
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,040
four--

850
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,800
You're tying my patience.

851
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,600
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten!

852
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,280
Run, Mowgli. Run!

853
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,320
Let go, you big oaf.

854
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,600
Take it easy. Take it--
Whoo! Ho-Hold it, hold it.

855
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,840
Whoa. Slow down. Ooh!
Yow! Whoa! Slow! Easy now.

856
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,880
Ooh. Oh, boy. Easy.

857
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,800
He's got a tiger
by the tail, he has.

858
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,800
And he'd better
hang on too.

859
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,800
Take that, ya big bully.

860
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,840
Let him have it again, kid.
Hit him again, kid. Go on!

861
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,160
Baloo! Help me!

862
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,840
Somebody do somethin'
with that kid.

863
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,880
Come on, lads.

864
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,880
He's safe now.

865
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,960
You can let go, Baloo.

866
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,640
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.

867
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,480
I'll kill you for this.

868
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,320
Let go!
Baloo needs help!

869
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,960
Fire! That's the only thing
old Stripes is afraid of.

870
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,240
You get the fire.
We'll do the rest.

871
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,520
- Charge!
- You there, punch and blow.

872
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,160
Stay out of this,
you mangy fools.

873
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,800
Yeah, yeah.
Missed me a mile, he did.

874
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,880
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Pull his blinkin' whiskers.

875
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,320
He's a bloomin' pussycat,
he is.

876
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,160
Look behind you, chum.

877
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,280
Well, that's
the last of him.

878
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,560
Old Stripes took off like
a flaming comet, he did.

879
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,000
Well, come on. Let's go
congratulate our friend.

880
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,920
Hold it, fellas.

881
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,800
Now's not the time for it.
Look.

882
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,000
Baloo?

883
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,280
Baloo, get up.
Oh, please get up.

884
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,840
Mowgli, try to understand.

885
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,480
Bagheera, what's
the matter with him?

886
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,400
You've got to be brave,
like Baloo was.

887
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,080
You-- You don't mean--

888
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,560
Oh, no. Baloo.

889
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,440
Now, now.

890
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,960
I know how you feel.

891
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,200
But you must remember,
Mowgli...

892
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,960
greater love
hath no one...

893
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,560
than he who lays down
his life for his friend.

894
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,680
When great deeds are
remembered in this jungle...

895
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:48,920
one name will stand
above all others--

896
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,080
our friend, Baloo, the bear.

897
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,600
- He's crackin' me up.
- The memory of Baloo's...

898
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,520
sacrifice and bravey...

899
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:03,920
will forever be engraved
on our saddened hearts.

900
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:08,560
- Beautiful.
- This spot where Baloo fell...

901
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,680
will always be a hallowed
place in the jungle...

902
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,520
for there lies
one of nature's...

903
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,440
noblest creatures.

904
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,880
I wish my mother
could've heard this.

905
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,040
It's best we leave now.

906
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,440
Come along, man cub.

907
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,320
Hey, don't stop now, Baghee.
You're doin' great!

908
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,720
There's more, lots more.

909
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,240
Why, you big fraud!

910
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,200
You, you, you four-flusher!

911
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,400
I-I'm fed up, and I-I--

912
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,960
Baloo! You're all right!

913
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,080
Who, me? Sure I am.

914
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,400
Never felt better.

915
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,280
You sure had us worried.

916
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,840
Ah, I was just takin' five.

917
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,680
You know, playin' it cool.

918
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,640
Yeah, but he was too easy.

919
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,000
Good old Papa Bear.

920
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,880
It's going to be a bit dull without
the little bloke, isn't it?

921
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,480
Yeah. So what we gonna do?

922
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,960
I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start that again!

923
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,240
Hey, Baghee, too bad
you missed the action.

924
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,920
You should have seen how
I made a sucker out of old Stripes
with that left up in his face.

925
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,840
Boom, boom,
I was givin' him. Whang!

926
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,560
You wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparrin' partners.

927
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,320
You'd better believe it.

928
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,200
Yes, sir.

929
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:36,720
Nothin' or nobody is ever
gonna come between us again.

930
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,040
My own home

931
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,560
My own home

932
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:48,240
My own home

933
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:52,080
My own home

934
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,040
- Look. What's that?
- Oh, it's the man village.

935
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,440
No, no. I mean that.

936
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,480
Forget about those.
They ain't nothin' but trouble.

937
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,400
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.

938
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,280
So you've seen one.
So let's go.

939
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,640
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.

940
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,680
- Mowgli, wait a minute.
- Ah, Baloo.

941
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,600
Let him have
a better look.

942
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,040
Father's hunting in the forest

943
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,720
Mother's cooking in the home

944
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,320
I must go to fetch the water

945
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,000
Till the day that I am grown

946
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,680
Till I'm grown

947
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,200
Till I'm grown

948
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:53,120
I must go to fetch the water

949
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:57,480
Till the day that I am grown

950
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,280
Then I will have
a handsome husband

951
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,320
And a daughter of my own

952
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:25,160
And I'll send her
to fetch the water

953
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,400
I'll be cooking in the home

954
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,120
Then I'll send her
to fetch the water

955
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,840
I'll be cooking in my home

956
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,760
She did that on purpose.

957
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,680
Obviously.

958
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:30,800
Mowgli, come back.
Come back!

959
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,120
Go on! Go on!

960
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,120
He's hooked.

961
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,400
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.

962
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,240
The boy couldn't help himself.
It was bound to happen.

963
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,520
Mowgli is where
he belongs now.

964
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,080
Yeah...

965
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,520
I guess you're right.

966
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:17,320
But I still think he'd
have made one swell bear.

967
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,640
Well, come on,
Baghee buddy.

968
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,800
Let's get back
to where we belong...

969
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,360
and get with the beat.

970
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,200
Look for the bare necessities

971
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,360
The simple bare necessities

972
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,280
Forget about your worries
And your strife

973
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,000
I mean the bare necessities

974
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,200
Are Mother Nature's recipes

975
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:43,560
That bring the bare
necessities of life
