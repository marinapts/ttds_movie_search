1
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,439
Pardon me for asking, but who's that
little old man?

2
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,000
-What little old man?
-That little old man.

3
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,639
-Oh, that one. That's my grandfather.
-Your grandfather?

4
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,039
-That's not your grandfather.
-It is, you know.

5
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,960
But I've seen your grandfather.
He lives in your house.

6
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,159
That's my other grandfather, but he's
my grandfather as well.

7
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,759
How do you reckon that one out?

8
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,599
Everyone's entitled to two, aren't
they? And that's my other one.

9
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,360
We know all that, but what's he doing
here?

10
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,199
-Mother thought the trip'd do him good.
-How's that?

11
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
He's nursing a broken heart.

12
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,479
Poor old thing.

13
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,639
Are you nursing a broken heart?

14
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,560
He's a nice old man, isn't he?

15
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,000
He's very clean.

16
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,360
-Hello, Grandfather.
-Hello.

17
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
He can talk then, can he?

18
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,039
Of course.
He's a human being, isn't he?

19
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
If he's your grandfather, who knows?

20
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,560
-And we're looking after him, are we?
-I'll look after meself.

21
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,599
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

22
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
He's got you worried, then?

23
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,480
Him? He's a villain, a real mixer.

24
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,720
And he'll cost you a fortune in breach
of promise cases.

25
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,319
-Get on.
-No, straight up.

26
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,040
-Hello, Shake.
-Hello, Shake.

27
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,279
You got on all right, then?

28
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,879
No.

29
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,680
We're here. Norm will be along in a
minute with the tickets.

30
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,560
Who's the little old man?

31
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,959
It's Paul's grandfather.

32
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,920
-But I thought--
-No, That's his other one.

33
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,920
Oh, that's all right, then.

34
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,959
Clean though, isn't he?

35
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,360
Aye. He's very clean.

36
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,759
Thank God, you all got here. I've had
a marvelous idea.

37
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:59,439
Once, let's all try to behave like
ordinary respectable citizens.

38
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,519
Let's not cause trouble or pull any
strokes.

39
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,920
Or do anything I'd be sorry for inj
that television theater.*

40
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,399
Are you listening to me, Lennon?

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,439
You're a swine. Isn't he, George?

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,959
Yeah, a swine.

43
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,439
Thanks.

44
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,399
Hey!

45
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
Who's that little old man?

46
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,079
-Well, who is he?
-He belongs to Paul.

47
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,839
I'm going down for a cup of coffee.
Anyone coming?

48
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,240
We'll follow you down.

49
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,480
-I want me coffee.
-You can come with Shake and me.

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,279
And look after him. I don't want to
find you've lost him.

51
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't be cheeky. I'll bind him to me
with promises.

52
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,000
Very clean, isn't he?

53
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,759
Come on, Granddad.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,160
Make up your mind, will you?

55
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,959
Hello. Morning.

56
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,639
All right.

57
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,240
Do you mind if we have it open?

58
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,519
Yes, I do.

59
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,399
Four of us want it open, if it's all
the same to you.

60
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,759
It isn't. I travel on this train
regularly twice a week...

61
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
...so I suppose I have some rights.

62
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
So have we.

63
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,319
We'll have that thing off as well.

64
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,360
Knowledge of the Railway Acts tell you
I'm within my rights.

65
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,759
But we want to hear it.

66
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,279
We're a community, majority vote, up
the workers and all that stuff.

67
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,439
Then I suggest you take that damn thing
into the corridor...

68
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,920
...or some other part of the train
where you obviously belong.

69
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,759
Give us a kiss.

70
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,199
Look, we paid for our seats too, you
know.

71
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,040
I travel on this train regularly,
twice a week.

72
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,680
Knock it off, Paul. You can't win
with his sort.

73
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,600
After all, it's his train.
Isn't it, mister?

74
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
And don't take that tone with me,
young man.

75
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,439
I fought the war for your sort.

76
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,879
I bet you're sorry you won.

77
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,439
-I shall call the guard.
-Ah, but what?

78
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,600
They don't take kindly to insults,
you know.

79
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,879
Let's go have some coffee and leave
the kennel to Lassie.

80
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,120
Hey, mister, can we have
our ball back?

81
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,959
Look, mister!

82
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,439
Mister, can we have our ball back?

83
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,600
-You want to watch it!
-Well, it's not my fault.

84
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,519
-You stick to that story, son.
-I can't help it. I'm taller than you.

85
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,040
They always say that.

86
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,519
I've got me eye on you.

87
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,839
I'm sorry, Norm. I can't help being
taller than you.

88
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,399
Don't rub it in. I've a good mind to
thump you, Shake.

89
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
If you have a barney, can I hold your
coat?

90
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,560
-He started it.
-I did not, you did.

91
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,839
What happened?

92
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,000
The old fellow said could he have
these pictures and Norm said no.

93
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,279
I said "Why not be big about it?"

94
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:17,920
And?

95
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,959
Your grandfather said that Shake was
always being taller just to spite me.

96
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,399
I knew it. He started it.

97
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,199
-I should've known.
-You what?

98
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,160
You two never argue and in two minutes
flat he's got you at it.

99
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,879
He's a king mixer.

100
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,600
He hates group unity, so he gets
everyone at it.

101
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,360
I suggest you just give him the photos
and have done with it.

102
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,679
All right, you old devil.
Here you are.

103
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,360
Hey, Pauly, would you ever sign
one of them for us?

104
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,120
Come on, Shake.

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Hey, look at the talent.

106
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,919
-Let's give them a pull.
-Should l?

107
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,559
Don't rush. None of your five-bar gate
jumps.

108
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,639
What's that supposed to mean?

109
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,120
I don't know. I thought it just
sounded distinguished.

110
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,799
George Harrison, The Scouse of
Distinction.

111
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,799
Excuse me, madam.

112
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,279
These young men I'm with wondered if
two of us could come over and join you.

113
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,399
I'd ask you meself only I'm shy.

114
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,440
I'm sorry, miss. You mustn't
fraternize with me prisoners.

115
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,159
-Prisoners?
-Convicts in transit.

116
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,240
-Typical old lags, the lot of them.
-You what?

117
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,080
Get out, ladies! Get out, while you
can!

118
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,679
SON OF MAD

119
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,279
He's been gone a long time.

120
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,159
-Who?
-Paul's grandfather.

121
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,919
-I didn't notice. Where did he go?
-Down the, uh....

122
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,559
-Oh, down the, uh....
-Yeah. Down the, uh....

123
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,000
Give him a couple of minutes, then.

124
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,559
Hey, have you seen Paul's grandfather?

125
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,840
Of course. He's concealed about me
person.

126
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,440
He must have slipped off somewhere.

127
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,279
-Have you lost him?
-Don't exaggerate.

128
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,039
-You've lost him!
-Look, put it this way, Pauly....

129
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
He's mislaid him.

130
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
Honest, you can' t trust you with
anything, Norm.

131
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,039
-If you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
-He can't have gone far.

132
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,799
Come, lads, let's look up the sharp
end.

133
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,919
What's the matter with you, then?

134
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,519
It's his grandfather. He doesn't like
me 'cause I'm little.

135
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,840
You've got an inferiority complex.

136
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,840
That's why I play the drums. It's me
active compensatory factor.

137
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,000
Going in, then?

138
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,919
No. She'll only reject me in the end
and I'll be frustrated.

139
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,759
You may be lucky this time.

140
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,240
No, I know the psychological pattern.
It plays havoc with me drum skins.

141
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,879
-You seen that old man we were with?
-We've broken out!

142
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,440
The blessed freedom of it all.

143
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,240
Have you got a nail file?
These handcuffs are killing me.

144
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,159
I was framed. I'm innocent.

145
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,000
Sorry for disturbing you girls.

146
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,840
I bet you can't guess what I was in for.

147
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,840
Should we go in here?

148
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,399
No, it's probably a honeymoon couple or
a company director.

149
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I don't care. I'm going to broaden me
outlook.

150
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,240
-Congratulate me, boys. I'm engaged.
-Oh, no you're not.

151
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,360
And to think me own grandson would've
let them put me behind bars.

152
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,200
Don't dramatize. You're lucky
to be here.

153
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,799
If they'd have had their own way you'd
have been dropped off already.

154
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,799
You've got to admit you've upset
a lot of people.

155
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,120
At least I can keep my eye on you while
you're stuck in here.

156
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,919
Shove up.

157
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,480
-Odds or evens?
-Odds.

158
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,559
Don't worry, son. We'll get the best
lawyer green stamps can buy.

159
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,480
It's a laugh a line with Lennon.

160
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,080
-Anyway, it's your fault.
-Why me?

161
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,000
Why not you?

162
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,240
God, it's depressing in here, isn't it?

163
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,679
Funny. They usually reckon dogs more
than people in England.

164
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
You'd expect something more palatial.

165
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,320
-Let's do something, then.
-Like what?

166
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,840
Okay.

167
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,960
There's the girls.

168
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,960
I'll deal.

169
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,200
The Liverpool Shuffle.

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,639
1 for you, 2 for me, 3 for him.

171
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,320
-He's wearing his lucky rings.
-All mine.

172
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,840
They won't buy you happiness, my son.

173
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,480
Hey! Don't move, any of you.

174
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,519
They've gone potty out there. The
place is surging with girls.

175
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,799
Please, sir, can I have one?

176
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,960
No, you can't.

177
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,000
When I tell you, get out through this
door into that big car that's waiting.

178
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,000
Come on, lads! Go ahead!

179
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,919
-I don't snore.
-You do. Repeatedly.

180
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,600
-Do I snore, John?
-Yeah. You're a window rattler, son.

181
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,759
It's just your opinion. Do I snore,
Paul?

182
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,720
With a trombone hooter like yours it
would be unnatural if you didn't.

183
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,120
No, Pauly. Don't mock the afflicted.

184
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,720
Come off it. It's only a joke.

185
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,039
It may be a joke, but it's his nose.

186
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,839
He can't help having a hideous,
great hooter.

187
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,839
And the poor little head trembling
under the weight of it.

188
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,599
John, Paul, George, come on.

189
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,079
Get at it.

190
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,200
The income tax caught up with us at
last.

191
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,839
-None for me, then?
-Sorry.

192
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,440
This will keep you busy.

193
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,200
It's your nose, you know. Fans are
funny that way.

194
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,480
They take a dislike to things. They'll
pick on a nose.

195
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,400
You pick on your own.

196
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,240
Here.

197
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,400
-Are those yours?
-No. They're for Ringo.

198
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,039
It must have cost you a fortune
in stamps, Ringo.

199
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,319
He comes from a large family.

200
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,039
Well.

201
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,920
What's The Circle Club?

202
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,599
"The Circle Club requests the company
of Mr. Richard Starkey"...that's you--

203
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,640
"...to their gaming rooms. Chemin de
fer, baccarat and champagne buffet."

204
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,759
-They want me.
-It's got round you're a big spender.

205
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,680
You're not going.

206
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,319
Quite right. Invites to gambling dens
full of easy money and fast women...

207
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,039
...chicken sandwiches and cornets of
caviar. Disgusting.

208
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:04,839
That's mine.

209
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,799
Get your pens out.

210
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:07,559
Why?

211
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,759
It's homework time for you load of
college puddings.

212
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,039
I want this lot answered tonight.

213
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
I want to go out.

214
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,240
'll brook no denial.

215
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,119
You couldn't get a pen in your foot,
you swine.

216
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,599
Chatter on, son, chatter on.

217
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,000
A touch of the writer's cramp will soon
sort you out. Come on, Shake.

218
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,480
For now, then.

219
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,400
-Where you going, then?
-He told us to stay, didn't he?

220
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,559
-Come, lad.
-What?

221
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,200
I just got to get me jacket.

222
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,799
-Couldn't we get a taxi?
-No, we couldn't get a taxi.

223
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,359
Come in.

224
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,799
I'll clear up, sir.

225
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,559
Suivez.

226
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,359
Alors, monsieur?

227
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,640
Souffl.

228
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,759
I bet you're a great swimmer.

229
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,759
My turn?

230
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,359
Bingo!

231
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,440
Pas "Bingo", monsieur. "Banco."

232
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,559
I'll take the little darlings anyway.

233
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:11,359
Two and one are three, carry one is
four.

234
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,519
Bingo!

235
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,359
The manager!

236
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,160
Come on!

237
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,359
Now, come on you lot,
get on with it.

238
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,519
-We were gonna do them, but you know.
-Aye. Well, now, now, now!

239
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,960
I'm starting.

240
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,880
Hey? Any of you lot put a man in the
cupboard?

241
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,400
No.

242
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,279
Well, somebody did.

243
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,200
He's right, you know.

244
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,599
There you go.

245
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,319
Hey?

246
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,920
What's all this?

247
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,559
Oh, him. He's been lurking.

248
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,359
He looks a right lurker, doesn't he?

249
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,000
You're undressed.
Where are your clothes?

250
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,519
Well, the old gentlemen, he borrowed
them to go gambling at the Circ'.

251
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,359
-He's gone to my club, has he?
-Yeah. It's all your fault.

252
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,200
-What?
-Getting invites to gambling clubs.

253
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
He's probably in the middle of some
orgy by now.

254
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,599
Orgy!

255
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:11,160
-Yeah, but what about me?
-You're too old.

256
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,319
Encore du champagne, monsieur?

257
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,799
Oh, yeah. And I'll have some more
champagne as well.

258
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,160
Lord John McCartney, millionaire,
lrish peer, filthy rich, of course.

259
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,480
I don't know.
He looks quite clean to me.

260
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,920
Try to act with a bit of decorum.
This is a posh place.

261
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,880
We know how to behave.
We've had lessons.

262
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:31,440
I'm sorry, sir, members and invited
guests only.

263
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,119
Aye, well, uh....

264
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm with them. I'm Ringo's sister.

265
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,480
-Have you got a little old man here?
-Do you mean Lord McCartney?

266
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:47,640
He's at it again. I'm his grandfather.
I mean....

267
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,599
It must be the dolly floor show.

268
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,759
Put me down!

269
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,799
Who are these ruffians?

270
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,599
Before you go, gentlemen, there's the
little matter of the bill.

271
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,599
I'll take care of that.

272
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,559
-A hundred and eighty pounds?!
-I beg your pardon, guineas.

273
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,359
Your winnings, my Lord,
one hundred and ninety pounds.

274
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,359
-What about me change?
-Cloak room charge.

275
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,680
Ah, well, easy come, easy go.

276
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,240
Well?

277
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,160
Ah, the filthy Englander.

278
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,480
Keep boating, Tiny.

279
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
-Go on, George.
-Don't be ridiculous.

280
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,559
-But you said I could.
-Me mind boggles at the very idea.

281
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,960
A grown man and you haven't shaved
with a safety razor.

282
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,440
It's not my fault. I come from a long
line of electricians.

283
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,319
-Well, you're not practicing on me.
-All right, then. But show us.

284
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,920
Come on, then.

285
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,920
Rule Britannia! Britannia, rule the--

286
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,559
Put your tongue away. It looks
disgusting hanging there.

287
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,039
One slip of the razor and....

288
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,200
Henreich! Headphones!

289
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,839
Help!

290
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Torpedoed again, eh?

291
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:37,039
The car's waiting to take you to the
studio. Where's John?

292
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,559
In the bath.

293
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,799
All right, Lennon, let's have you.

294
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,920
Come on, John, stop larking about.

295
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,079
John?

296
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,640
John? John?

297
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,480
What are you messing around
with that boat for?

298
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
There's a car waiting. Come on!

299
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,599
Ready, John? As soon as we draw up,
open that door and straight in.

300
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,680
-Can't be waiting much longer.
-I knew they'd be late.

301
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,839
It's your press conference.

302
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,960
Where have you been?

303
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,440
Give us a couple of shakes
to get our breath.

304
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,359
Give us a shout when it's over.

305
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,000
I have a suit just like him, you know.

306
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,920
This lot means it.
They're even taking hostages.

307
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,839
I don't like the handkerchief.
I have it in me trouser pocket.

308
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,759
You can't blow your nose on it up
there, can you, mister?

309
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,359
No, you can't.

310
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,119
I've always liked that question.

311
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,960
I never notice his nose
till about six months ago.

312
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Me mother asked me before we left for
America if we wanted any sandwiches.

313
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,759
And when I plugged her in
she just blew up.

314
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:49,119
Tell me, how did you find America?

315
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,640
Turn left at Greenland.

316
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,559
-Has success changed your life?
-Yes.

317
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,319
I'd like to keep Britain tidy.

318
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,960
Are you a mod or a rocker?

319
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,200
Um, no. I'm a mocker.

320
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Have you any hobbies?

321
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,160
No, actually we're just
good friends.

322
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,160
Do you think these haircuts
have come to stay?

323
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,759
Well, this one has, you know, it's
stuck on good and proper now.

324
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
Frightfully nice.

325
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,799
-What would you call that hairstyle?
-Arthur.

326
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,039
No, actually we're just good friends.

327
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,119
Yours are brown, aren't they?

328
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,400
What do you call that collar?

329
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,160
Oh, a collar.

330
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,920
-Do you often see your father?
-No, actually we're just good friends.

331
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,960
How do you like your girlfriends
to dress?

332
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,279
That was a drag. I'm starving.

333
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,240
-Didn't even get a jam butty. Did you?
-No.

334
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,359
Anything left?

335
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,119
We just finished, Pauly.

336
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,319
Hey, George, give us your John Henry
on that picture.

337
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,000
-Look at that!
-What's there?

338
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,920
-It's our set down there.
-Should we go down and have a go?

339
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,599
-There's trees and everything.
-That's a lot of fellows for one set.

340
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,000
-That's not a tree.
-It is.

341
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,559
It's a bird.

342
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,559
Just passing through.

343
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,079
-Where are they?
-On the stage. Down here.

344
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,400
Leave them drums alone.

345
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,400
Surely, I could have
just a little touch.

346
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,960
You so much as breathe,
I'm out on strike.

347
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?

348
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,519
There you go. Hiding behind a smoke
screen of bourgeois clichs.

349
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,119
I don't go messing about with your
earphones, do l?

350
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,200
Spoilsport.

351
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,720
Well.

352
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,359
He's very fussy about his drums, you
know. They loom large in his legend.

353
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,359
-What's up?
-He's sulking again.

354
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,839
I'll show him.

355
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,480
Pardon, Tiny.
I'd like more drums there.

356
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,279
-I think it's on the third bit.
-It sounds like a cover.

357
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,839
On the third bit, more bang!

358
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,160
All right, let's hear no more about it.
You're probably right.

359
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Look.

360
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,119
If you think I'm unsuitable, let's be
open. I can't stand backstage politics.

361
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,839
Aren't you tending to black-and-white
the situation somewhat?

362
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,519
Well, quite honestly, I wasn't
expecting a musical arranger...

363
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,200
...to question my ability
picture- wise.

364
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,039
I could listen to him for hours.

365
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,839
What's all this about
a musical arranger?

366
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,400
Mr. McCartney, Sr.

367
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,679
Pauly, they're trying to fob you off
with this musical charlatan...

368
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,840
...but I gave him the test.

369
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:16,800
I'm quite happy to be replaced.

370
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,920
He's a typical buck-passer.

371
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,400
-I won an award.
-A likely story.

372
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,559
It's on the wall in my office.

373
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,800
Hello, our lot. Everybody happy?

374
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,079
All right. If you don't need them,
I'll lock them up in the dressing room.

375
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,000
Please do. I'll not need them for half
an hour. Thank you.

376
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,840
Get me a bottle of milk and some
tranquilizers.

377
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,119
It's a I see it all now. It's a plot.

378
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,639
Tranquilizers.

379
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,119
Come on, I've got the key.

380
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,400
Come on, Ringo.

381
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,079
Come on.

382
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,639
Leslie Jackson?

383
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,599
I saw your father in the old Empire
in 1 909.

384
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,840
If you're as good as him, son,
you're all right.

385
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,599
Gear costume.

386
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,880
-Swap?
-Cheeky.

387
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,440
Come on, lads.
No messing about.

388
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,800
Lennon, put them girls down
or I'll tell your mother.

389
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,519
Stop messing about.

390
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,039
Stay in here until that rehearsal.

391
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,679
If I have to, I'll put the key in the
lock and turn it.

392
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,719
We're out!

393
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:59,000
I suppose you realize
this is private property.

394
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,480
Sorry we hurt your field, mister.

395
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,599
Not here.
Hello, Dicky.

396
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,639
Probably gone to the canteen.

397
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,119
No, that's too easy for Lennon.

398
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,559
He's out there somewhere
causing trouble, just to upset me.

399
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,920
You're imagining it,
letting it prey on your mind.

400
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:24,760
No, this is a battle of nerves
between John and me.

401
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,039
John hasn't got any.

402
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,800
-What?
-Nerves.

403
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,000
No, that's just the trouble.

404
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,920
I've toyed with the idea
of a ball and chain...

405
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:36,519
...but he'd just rattle them at me.

406
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:38,920
Sometimes I think he enjoys
seeing me suffer.

407
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,880
-Hello!
-Hello.

408
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,320
-Don't tell me you're--
-No, I'm not.

409
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,559
-You are.
-I'm not.

410
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,000
I know you are.

411
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:51,480
I'm not, no.

412
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,480
-You look just like him.
-Do l?

413
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,199
You're the first one
that's said that, ever.

414
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,119
Yes, you do. Look.

415
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,000
No, my eyes are lighter.
All right, Noddy.

416
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,199
-The nose.
-Yes, your nose is, very.

417
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,039
-Is it?
-I would have said so.

418
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,320
-You know him better.
-He's only a casual acquaintance.

419
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,360
-That's what you say.
-What have you heard?

420
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,599
-It's all over the place.
-Is it really?

421
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,000
But I wouldn't have it.
I stuck up for you.

422
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,639
-I knew I could rely on you.
-Thanks.

423
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,239
You don't look like him at all.

424
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,360
She looks more like him than I do.

425
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,239
There will be a full rehearsal
in ten minutes.

426
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:46,119
Ten minutes from now,
a full rehearsal.

427
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,719
There you are.

428
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,320
Sorry, I must have made a mistake.

429
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,320
No, you're just late. Actually, I
think he'll be very pleased with you.

430
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,199
-Really?
-You're quite a feather in the cap.

431
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
I've got one.

432
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,679
I think so.

433
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,599
Yes, he can talk.

434
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,440
No, and I think
you ought to see him.

435
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,320
All right.

436
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,679
Come on.

437
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,880
Sorry.

438
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,840
You don't see many of these nowadays,
do you?

439
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,360
Come on.

440
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,360
Simon, will this do?

441
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:43,199
Not bad, dolly, not really bad.
Turn around, chicky baby.

442
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,360
He's a definite poss.
He'll look good alongside Susan.

443
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:49,960
This will be quite painless. Don't
breathe on me, Adrian.

444
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,280
I'm terribly sorry, but there seems to
be some sort of misunderstanding.

445
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,519
You can come off it with us.

446
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,920
Don't do all the old adenoidal glottal
stop and carry on for our benefit.

447
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm afraid I don't understand.

448
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,960
-My God, he's a natural.
-I told them not to send real ones.

449
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,400
They know by now, the phonies
are much easier to handle.

450
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,440
Still, he's a good type.

451
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,719
We'd like you to give us your opinion
on some clothes for teenagers.

452
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,400
By all means, I'd be quite prepared
for that eventuality.

453
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,519
Not your real opinion.
You'll learn it.

454
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,079
-Can he read?
-Of course I can.

455
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,559
I mean lines.
Can you handle lines?

456
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,159
I'll have a bash.

457
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,000
Give him whatever it is they drink,
a cokerama?

458
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,320
Ta.

459
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,920
At least he's polite.

460
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,119
Show him the shirts. Adrian.

461
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,719
You'll like these.

462
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,079
You'll really dig them. They're fab
and all the other pimply hyperboles.

463
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,880
I wouldn't be seen dead in them.
They're dead grotty.

464
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,760
-Grotty?
-Yeah, grotesque.

465
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,239
Make a note of that word
and give it to Susan.

466
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,679
It's rather touching, really.

467
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,639
This kid is trying to give me his
utterly valueless opinion...

468
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,559
...when I know that within a month...

469
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,039
...he'll be suffering from a violent
inferiority complex...

470
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:06,840
...and loss of status because he isn't
wearing one of these nasty things.

471
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,159
Of course they're grotty, you wretched
nit! That's why they were designed.

472
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,519
-But that's what you'll want.
-I won't.

473
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,719
-You can be replaced, chicky baby.
-I don't care.

474
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:16,800
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim.

475
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,400
The new thing is to care passionately
and be right wing.

476
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,960
Anyway, if you don't cooperate, you
won't meet Susan.

477
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:25,519
And who's this Susan when she's at
home?

478
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,679
Only Susan Campey,
our resident teenager.

479
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,079
You'll have to love her.
She's your symbol.

480
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,280
You mean that posh bird who gets
everything wrong?

481
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,239
I beg your pardon?

482
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,039
The lads frequently sit round the
television and watch her for a giggle.

483
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:43,760
Once we wrote these letters saying how
gear she was and all that rubbish.

484
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,119
She's a trendsetter.
It's her profession.

485
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,360
She's a drag. A well-known drag.

486
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:50,599
We turn the sound down on her
and say rude things.

487
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,440
-Get him out of here.
-Have I said something amiss?

488
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,280
He's mocking the program's image.

489
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,519
-Sorry about the shirts.
-Get him out!

490
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:03,039
You don't think he's a new phenomenon,
do you?

491
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,199
You mean an early clue to the new
direction?

492
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,159
Where's the calendar?

493
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,079
No. It's all right. He's just a
troublemaker.

494
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,119
The change isn't due
for three weeks yet.

495
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,559
All the same, make a note not to extend
Susan's contract.

496
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,280
Let's not take
any unnecessary chances.

497
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,559
So I explained to my mommy
he was a very clean man.

498
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,199
There's no one here.

499
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,840
Where have they gone?

500
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,400
Surely, that's wrong, isn't it?
Not you.

501
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,360
Get him out!

502
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,239
Someone's coming! Quick, hide!

503
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,880
Stop being taller than me.

504
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,559
It's not my fault.

505
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,679
Right on time.

506
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:48,360
-What are you doing here?
-Hiding.

507
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,199
-You must be soft or something.
-We weren't hiding. We were resting.

508
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,000
I thought I told you lot to stay here.

509
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:56,480
When I say stay put, I mean stay put.

510
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:58,559
Don't cane me, sir. I was led astray.

511
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,400
Shut up, John. They're waiting for you
in the studio.

512
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,079
Gear, I'm dying to do a bit of work.

513
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,519
God bless you, Ringo.

514
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:06,239
-Teacher's pet.
-Crawler.

515
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,159
-Betrayed the class, eh?
-Lay off.

516
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
-Temper!
-Well!

517
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,280
Get a move on,
they're waiting for you!

518
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,719
Sorry.

519
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,239
I now declare this bridge open.

520
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,960
Where are they?

521
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,440
Where are they?

522
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,599
Where are they?

523
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,159
They're coming.

524
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,119
They're coming. I promise you.

525
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,519
If they're not on this floor in
thirty seconds there'll be trouble.

526
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:36,320
Understand me?

527
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:37,639
Trouble.

528
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,559
Standing about?

529
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,239
-Some people have it dead easy.
-Once your over thirty, your past it.

530
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,360
It's a young man's medium. I just
can't stand the pace.

531
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:51,679
-As young as that, then?
-I was.

532
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,800
There he goes. Look at him. Bet his
wife doesn't know about her.

533
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,360
If he's got one.
Look at his sweater.

534
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:59,000
You never know.
She might have knitted it.

535
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:00,159
She knitted him.

536
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,760
Run through your number and try
not to jiggle out of position.

537
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,239
Hello, three? Coming to you.

538
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,239
Three? Three?
Coming to you. Three?

539
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,639
We are on three.

540
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,079
-What?
-We're on three.

541
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,239
Oh, yes.

542
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,679
Music.

543
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,039
Thank you. Very nice.

544
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
-Make-up?
-Not really. They don't need any.

545
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,880
-We'll powder them off for the shine.
-Yes.

546
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:54,039
Norm, take them down to Make-up and
powder them off. The shine, you know.

547
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,599
Sure.

548
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,199
You blinked!

549
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,480
Your grandfather's not talking to me.
I think he's got a sulk on.

550
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:05,480
It must be catching on. He's given it
to Ringo here.

551
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:08,000
-Stop picking on him.
-I don't need you to protect me.

552
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:09,840
Got a touch of the swine fever,
haven't you?

553
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:10,960
Come on, lads. Sit down.

554
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,000
This is impossible. We'll never get
them all done in time.

555
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,360
Then do us first. It doesn't matter to
them whether they're made up or not.

556
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,199
By the way, what's that?

557
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:20,280
My name's Betty.

558
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,239
Do you want a punch
up your frogged tunic?

559
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,559
John, behave yourself or I'll murder
you.

560
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,199
Shake, take that wig off.
It suits you.

561
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
Ringo, what are you up to?

562
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:31,920
Page five.

563
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:34,559
You always fancied yourself as a
guardsman, didn't you?

564
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,320
"That this too too solid flesh would
melt."

565
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,400
You won't interfere with the rugged
concept of my personality, will you?

566
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:44,719
QUEEN

567
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,760
He's reading "The Queen". That's an
in-joke, you know.

568
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,039
It's my considered opinion that you're
a bunch of sissies.

569
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,039
You're just jealous.

570
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,079
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell
them all the truth about you.

571
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,280
-You wouldn't.
-I would, though.

572
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:01,679
Lookit, I thought I was supposed to be
getting a change of scenery...

573
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,159
...and so far I've been in a train and
a room...

574
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,679
...and a car and a room and a room and
a room.

575
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,360
Maybe that's all right for a bunch of
powdered gewgaws like you.

576
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,599
But I'm feeling decidedly
straight-jacketed.

577
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,960
What a clean old man.

578
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:15,639
Don't press your luck.

579
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,280
He's sex-obsessed. The older generation
leading this country to galloping ruin.

580
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,519
What's a pretty girl like you doing in
a place like this?

581
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,239
They're nearly ready for you, lads.
Just finishing the band call.

582
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,519
I say, did you go to Harrod's?

583
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:34,159
I was there in fifty-eight, you know.

584
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,440
-I can get you on the stage.
-How?

585
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,840
Turn right at the corridor and go past
the fireplace.

586
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,119
I don't like yours.

587
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,840
Kids, I got an idea.

588
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,440
Why don't we do the show right here?

589
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,519
Two, three, four.

590
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,199
Very good, that, George.

591
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:20,840
We're trying.

592
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,400
-You're trying. Let's go.
-That was great, lads.

593
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,119
You've got about an hour, but don't
leave the theater.

594
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,559
Where are you going, John?

595
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,360
She's gonna show me
her stamp collection.

596
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,239
So's mine.

597
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,639
John, I'm talking to you.

598
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,840
This final run-through is important,
understand? lmportant!

599
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,280
I want a cup of tea!

600
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Shake?

601
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:44,199
I gotta adjust the decibels on the
imbalance, Norm.

602
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,880
Clever. George?

603
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:48,440
Ringo, look after him, will you?

604
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:49,559
Aw, Norm!

605
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,360
Do I have to raise my voice?

606
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,480
All right. Come on, Granddad.

607
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:57,960
I'm a drummer, not a wet nurse.
Why does it have to be me?

608
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,679
Look at him sitting there with his
hooter scraping away at that book.

609
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,960
Well, what's the matter with that?

610
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:28,480
Have you no natural resources
of your own?

611
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:30,360
Have they even robbed you of that?

612
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,119
You can learn from books.

613
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,880
You can, can you?

614
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:36,079
Sheeps heads!

615
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,360
You could learn more by getting out
there and living.

616
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,119
Out where?

617
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,920
Any old where!

618
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:43,880
But not our little Richard. Oh, no.

619
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,880
When you're not thumping them pagan
skins...

620
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,440
...you're tormenting your eyes with
that rubbish.

621
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:49,800
Books are good.

622
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,599
Parading's better.

623
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:53,960
Parading?

624
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,039
Parading the streets...

625
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:59,280
...trailing your coat, bowling along,
living!

626
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:02,360
-Well, I am living.
-You? Living?

627
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,760
When was the last time you gave
a girl a pink-edged daisy?

628
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,639
When did you last embarrass a sheila
with your...

629
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,119
...cool appraising stare?

630
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:14,880
You're a bit old for that sort of chat,
aren't you?

631
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,840
At least I've got a backlog of
memories.

632
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:19,360
All you've got is that book!

633
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:21,599
Stop picking on me. You're as bad as
the rest of them.

634
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,119
So you are a man after all!

635
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,840
What's that mean?

636
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,880
Do you think I haven't noticed?

637
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,719
Do you think I wasn't aware of the
drift?

638
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:33,480
You poor, unfortunate scruff.

639
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,599
They've driven you into books with
their cruel, unnatural treatment...

640
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,639
...exploiting your good nature.

641
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:42,000
I don't know.

642
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:45,559
Sure, that lot's never happier unless
they're jeering you.

643
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,719
Where'd they be without the steady
support of your drum beat...

644
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,360
...that's what I'd like to know.

645
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,119
Yeah, that's right.

646
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,199
And what's it all come to in the end?

647
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,360
Yeah, what's in it for me?

648
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:00,599
A book.

649
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:02,480
Yeah, a blooming book!

650
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:05,519
When you could be out there betraying
a rich American widow...

651
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:09,639
...or sipping palm wine in Tahiti
before you're too old like me.

652
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:14,000
Funny, being middle-aged and old...

653
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:15,760
...takes up most of your time,
doesn't it?

654
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,440
You're only right.

655
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,920
Where are you going?

656
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:24,639
I'm going parading
before it's too late.

657
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,559
-Do you know what just happened to me?
-No, I don't.

658
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,559
Stop looking so scornful.
It's twisting your face.

659
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,320
Tell you about--

660
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:47,159
Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.

661
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,960
I thought you were looking after the
old man.

662
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:54,400
We've only half an hour till the final
run-through. He can't walk out on us.

663
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,199
Can't he? He's done it, son.

664
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,519
-You know what happened?
-We know.

665
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,239
-Your grandfather stirred him up.
-He hasn't.

666
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,320
Yeah, he filled his head with notions,
seemingly.

667
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:07,239
The old mixer! Come on, we'll have to
put him right.

668
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,800
Can we have all dancers on stage for
rehearsal, please?

669
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,719
Split up and look for him.

670
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,960
We've become a limited company.

671
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:27,280
I'll look in here again.

672
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,159
WE BUY ANYTHING

673
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,559
-Hello, there.
-Get out of it, Shorty.

674
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,480
You should have more sense than
to go round chucking bricks about!

675
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,199
Southerner!

676
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:28,320
That's my hoop!
Stop playing with it!

677
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:31,119
That no hoop, it's a lethal weapon.
Have you got a license for it?

678
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,840
Don't be so stroppy!

679
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:34,719
A boy your age bowling hoops
at people.

680
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,199
-How old are you?
-Eleven.

681
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,880
I bet you're only ten and a half.

682
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:38,760
Ten and two-thirds.

683
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,880
There you are, then, and don't be
bowling people.

684
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:43,519
You can have it. I'm packing it in.
It depresses me.

685
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:45,320
-You what?
-It gets on me wick.

686
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:48,239
-Why aren't you at school?
-I'm a deserter.

687
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,119
Are you, now?

688
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,400
-I've blown school out.
-Just you?

689
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,440
No. Ginger, Eddie Fallon
and Ding Dong.

690
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,039
-Ding Dong bell, eh?
-That's right.

691
00:59:57,239 --> 00:59:59,639
They were supposed to come with us,
but they chickened.

692
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,280
They're your mates?

693
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,719
-Not much cop without them, is it?
-It's all right.

694
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,960
What're they like?

695
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:07,320
Ginger's mad.
He says things all the time.

696
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,840
-Eddie's good at spitting and punching.
-How about Ding Dong?

697
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,000
He fancies himself. It's all right
though, he's one of the gang.

698
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,719
Why aren't you at work?

699
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,000
I'm a deserter, too.

700
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,559
Charlie!

701
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:24,400
See you.

702
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,639
Come in, number seven,
your time's up!

703
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:49,440
I'm sorry, boys. I didn't mean it,
honest.

704
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:54,039
If he says that again,
I'll strike him.

705
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:56,440
They're good lads.
They'll be back.

706
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,280
Yes, but we've only twenty minutes to
the final run-through.

707
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,760
I meant no harm. I was trying to
encourage Ringo to enjoy himself.

708
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,440
God knows what you've unleashed
on the unsuspecting South.

709
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:14,119
It'll be wine, women and song all the
way when he gets the taste for it.

710
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,519
That was fresh this morning.
Two and nine.

711
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,519
Right! On your way!

712
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:13,840
-You what?
-You heard.

713
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:16,000
On your way, troublemaker.

714
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,960
Watch it!

715
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,920
-What?
-Worry, will you?

716
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:36,960
That's it, two minutes to the final
run-through.

717
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,599
-They're bound to miss it now.
-I'll murder that Lennon!

718
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,679
-We could survive a missed run-through.
-As long as they head up for the show?

719
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,039
You're right, I wouldn't do
to miss the show.

720
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:47,800
Shut up, cheerful.

721
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,320
You don't think--

722
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,480
-Don't worry.
-They can't do this to me!

723
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:53,559
It's all your fault.

724
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,239
-Me?
-Yes, it is.

725
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,440
If they don't turn up, I wouldn't be in
your shoes--

726
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:00,360
For all the tea in
China. Neither would l.

727
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:02,880
-You dirty traitor!
-Well, of course.

728
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,760
Yes, of course.

729
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:11,559
-Did you want something?
-I could eat the lot of you.

730
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,760
You'd look great
with an apple in your gob.

731
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,519
Do you realize you could have missed
the final run-through?

732
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:16,960
We're sorry about that.

733
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:18,719
Norm? There's only three of them.

734
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,320
We were looking for Ringo, but we
realized he must have come back here.

735
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:24,320
Would you realize that
we're on the air...

736
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:27,599
...live, in front of an audience in 45
minutes and you're one short?

737
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,719
Control yourself.
He must be here somewhere.

738
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,480
We'll look in the dressing room.

739
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,119
Yes, to the dressing rooms.

740
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,280
Where's me grandfather?

741
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,280
-He can look after himself.
-I suppose so.

742
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,159
Personally signed and hand-written by
your own sweet boys!

743
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,360
The chance of a lifetime!

744
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:48,719
Be the envy of your less fortunate
sisters!

745
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,440
Me photos! Where's me hat?

746
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:53,519
Break it up! Move up!

747
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,880
Come on, move along.

748
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:00,679
Why don't you go?

749
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,559
-Will you just move along?
-They'll take you apart if you stay.

750
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,760
I'll have the law on you!

751
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,440
Let's take you in.

752
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,760
Thank you.

753
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,679
Got you!
You nasty little person, you.

754
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,400
You what?

755
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,960
I'm Ringo Starr! I've got a show to
do. I'm on in a few minutes.

756
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:48,639
You've got to let me go.
I'm Ringo!

757
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,280
That's what they all say.

758
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,079
I don't care who you are. You can save
that for the stipendiary.

759
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,000
Here you are, Sarge.

760
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:57,199
-What is he?
-I've got a little list here.

761
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,119
"Wandering abroad, malicious intent,
acting in a suspicious manner...

762
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,840
...conduct liable to cause
a breach of the peace."

763
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,880
-You name it, he's done it.
-A little savage, is he?

764
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,920
-A proper little aborigine.
-I demand to see my solicitor.

765
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,360
What's his name?

766
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,199
If you're going to get technical
about it.

767
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,280
It's going to be one of those nights,
is it?

768
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,199
Sit Charlie Peace down over there.

769
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:21,039
You got me here, so do your worst!

770
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:23,719
But by God, I'll take
one of you with me.

771
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:26,280
I know your game!

772
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,840
You'll get me into tiled room and
then out come the rubber hoses!

773
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,800
There's a fire, is there?

774
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:34,719
You ugly, great brute!

775
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,000
You have sadism stamped all over your
bloated British kisser!

776
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,960
I'll go on hunger strike!

777
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,719
I know your caper.

778
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:43,719
The kidney punch
and the rabbit-clout...

779
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,880
...and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.

780
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:48,039
What's he on about?

781
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,960
I'm a soldier of the Republic!

782
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:52,719
You'll need a mahogany truncheon
on this boy-o.

783
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,440
A nation once again

784
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,719
A nation once again

785
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,519
Get Lloyd George over there next to the
mechanic in the cloth cap...

786
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,400
...and I'll sort this lot out.

787
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:05,079
Come on, Dad. Sit down over here.

788
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,480
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed your
leg for the iron too.

789
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:10,639
I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.

790
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,960
Have they roughed you up yet?
-What?

791
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:17,239
They're a desperate crew of drippings
and they've fists like matured hams...

792
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,360
...for pounding poor, defenseless lads
like you.

793
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,159
One of us has got to escape.
I'll get the boys.

794
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,239
-Hold on, son, I'll be back for you.
-For me?

795
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,320
And if they get you on the floor,
watch out for your brisket.

796
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:29,920
They seem all right to me.

797
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:33,440
That's what they want you to think.
All coppers are villains.

798
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:35,119
Would you two like a cup of tea?

799
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,199
You see? Sly villains.

800
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,159
No, thank you, Mister Sergeant, sir.

801
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,000
No, not for me. Please, don't.

802
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,239
So you just brought the old chap out of
the crowd for his own good?

803
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,840
He was getting a bit nasty, so we had
to bring him in.

804
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,639
He can't stop here.

805
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,280
This is the stuff he's been hawking
round?

806
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,480
-Yes, Sarge. Photographs.
-Photographs.

807
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,440
Well, son, it's now or never.

808
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,000
Johnny McCartney will give you a run
for your threepence ha'penny!

809
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,440
You forgot your photographs.

810
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:12,440
Only half an hour and you're on.

811
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,719
-Can I say something?
-Yes, anything.

812
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,480
It seems highly unlikely we'll be on.

813
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:20,039
I mean, the law of averages
are against it.

814
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,320
If you could get the juggler on with a
couple more clubs...

815
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,159
...that would fill in a bit of time.

816
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:42,320
You can't go in here.

817
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,960
I'll have the hides of you lot.

818
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,519
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Go home.

819
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:51,440
-I must see Pauly.
-Go home and see him on the telly.

820
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:55,480
-Can you fix him for me?
-Yeah.

821
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,039
Sixpence.

822
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,760
-Each.
-In advance.

823
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:01,639
Mercenaries.

824
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,199
It's all right.
Leave him alone.

825
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:25,880
What's happening here?

826
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:27,680
Paul, where are you?

827
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,359
Granddad, where's Ringo?

828
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,520
The police have the poor, unfortunate
lad in the Bridewell.

829
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,199
-The police station!
-He'll be pulp by now.

830
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,920
-Go get him!
-We'll get him. We'll fix it, Norm.

831
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,199
We've only got
twenty minutes.

832
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,600
What is all this?

833
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,039
Hold on until we get our breath.

834
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,239
Are you all right now?

835
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:03,600
Yeah.

836
01:10:04,359 --> 01:10:06,039
-Yeah?
-See you.

837
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,439
Quick, follow them!

838
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:56,640
I'd have to laugh even
when they kick the stool away.

839
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,840
Lads! You're back, thank goodness.
Where's Ringo?

840
01:11:00,039 --> 01:11:01,920
-There he is. We got him.
-Great!

841
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,479
If you hadn't come back it would have
meant...

842
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,880
...the epilogue or the news in Welsh
for life.

843
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:11,159
Aren't you supposed to be
in that box?

844
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,760
Where's the old mixer?

845
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,720
Here, Pauly.

846
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,880
I've got a few words to say to you,
two-faced John McCartney.

847
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:18,880
Leave him alone. He's back, isn't he?
It's not his fault he's old.

848
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:22,560
What's old got to do with it? He's a
troublemaker and a mixer.

849
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,039
You're right, but he's only asking for
attention.

850
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,439
Your trouble is you should have gone
west to America.

851
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,319
You would have been a senior citizen
of Boston.

852
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,520
You took a wrong turn and you're a
lonely old man from Liverpool.

853
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:35,319
Well, I'm clean.

854
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,239
Are you?

855
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:37,800
-Norm?
-What?

856
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:40,680
-I've been thinking, it's not my fault.
-What isn't?

857
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:44,479
I'm not taller than you are.
You're smaller than I am.

858
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,439
Anyone at home?

859
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,039
Shake, where's me boot?

860
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,600
-Will you get us some tea?
-All right.

861
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:55,399
Lads, get changed. We're going out
in five minutes.

862
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:13,520
I've got the stuff.
Come on, lads.

863
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,640
Aren't we going--

864
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,000
The office thinks it's best if we go to
Wolverhampton straight away.

865
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:20,920
-Tonight? We'll never make it.
-You've got a midnight matinee.

866
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:23,560
There's only one thing I've got to say
to you, John Lennon.

867
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,920
-What?
-You're a swine.

868
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:43,840
Come on, you're hanging up
the parade!

869
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,840
Get rid of those things.
