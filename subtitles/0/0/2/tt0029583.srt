1
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,339
Slave in the magic mirror,

2
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,925
come from the farthest space,

3
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:58,637
...through wind and darkness
I summon thee.

4
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:00,097
Speak!

5
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,769
Let me see thy face.

6
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,106
What wouldst thou know,
my Queen?

7
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,318
Magic mirror on the wall,

8
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,072
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,492
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:24,205
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:29,085
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:34,382
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:39,053
Alas for her!
Reveal her name.

14
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,056
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:44,725
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,353
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,731
Snow White!

18
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,435
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,103
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:34,233
We are standing by
a wishing well

21
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,279
Make a wish into the well

22
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,906
That's all you have to do

23
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,243
And if you hear it echoing

24
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,788
Your wish will soon come true

25
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:52,043
-I'm wishing
-I'm wishing

26
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,089
For the one I love to find me

27
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,799
To find me

28
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,594
-Today
-Today

29
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,930
-I'm hoping
-I'm hoping

30
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:11,103
-And I'm dreaming of
the nice things
-The nice things

31
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:14,190
-He'll say
-He'll say

32
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,860
-Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
-Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh

33
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,863
-Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
-Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh

34
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,199
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh

35
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,040
-I'm wishing
-I'm wishing

36
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,377
For the one I love

37
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,546
-To find me
-To find me

38
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,093
-Today
-Today

39
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,178
-Oh!
-Hello.

40
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,138
-Oh.
-Did I frighten you?

41
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,934
Wait. Wait, please.

42
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,061
Don't run away.

43
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,107
Now that I've found you

44
00:05:56,482 --> 00:06:00,903
Hear what I have to say

45
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,864
One song

46
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:07,493
I have but one song

47
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:15,001
One song only for you

48
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:21,215
One heart tenderly beating

49
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:25,219
Ever entreating

50
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:32,977
One love

51
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,565
That has possessed me

52
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,526
One love

53
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:44,864
Thrilling me through

54
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:49,035
One song

55
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:52,913
My heart keeps singing

56
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:57,084
Of one love

57
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:03,090
Only for you

58
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,358
Take her far into the forest.

59
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:25,946
Find some secluded glade
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:32,328
And there,
my faithful Huntsman,

62
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,789
you will kill her!

63
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,999
But, Your Majesty,
the little Princess!

64
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,709
Silence!

65
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:43,547
You know the penalty
if you fail.

66
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,884
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,221
But to make doubly sure...

68
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,099
you do not fail,

69
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,769
bring back her heart...

70
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,313
in this.

71
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:10,282
One song
I have but one song

72
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:29,176
Hello there.
What's the matter?

73
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,804
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,974
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,435
Oh, please, don't cry.

76
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,151
Come on. Perk up.

77
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,738
Won't you smile for me?
That's better.

78
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,284
Your mama and papa can't be far.

79
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,704
There they are.

80
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,333
Can you fly?

81
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,889
I can't! I can't do it!

82
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:19,852
Forgive me. I beg
of Your Highness, forgive me.

83
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:23,731
-I don't understand.
-She's mad! Jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothin'!

84
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:26,233
-But-- But who?
-The Queen!

85
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:29,195
-The Queen?
-Now, quick, child, run!
Run away, hide!

86
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,240
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!

87
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,451
Now, go! Go!

88
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:41,248
Go! Run! Run! Hide!

89
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,659
Oh!

90
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:49,251
Please, don't run away.
I won't hurt you.

91
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,632
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

92
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,343
But you don't know
what I've been through.

93
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,180
And all because
I was afraid.

94
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,142
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.

95
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:09,146
What do you do
when things go wrong?

96
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:14,360
Oh!
You sing a song!

97
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,032
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh

98
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,078
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh

99
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:30,084
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh

100
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:36,590
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh

101
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:46,308
With a smile and a song

102
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,688
Life is just like
a bright, sunny day

103
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,399
Your cares fade away

104
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:58,029
And your heart is young

105
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,451
With a smile and a song

106
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:07,538
All the world
seems to waken anew

107
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:15,296
Rejoicing with you
as the song is sung

108
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,924
There's no use in grumbling

109
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,428
When raindrops come tumbling

110
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:27,183
Remember you're the one

111
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:32,938
Who can fill the world
with sunshine

112
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:37,401
When you smile and you sing

113
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:41,322
Everything is in tune
and it's spring

114
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:44,784
And life flows along

115
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,956
With a smile and a song

116
00:13:55,294 --> 00:14:00,299
I really feel quite happy now.
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

117
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,594
Everything's going
to be all right.

118
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:07,932
But I do need
a place to sleep at night.

119
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:11,477
I can't sleep
in the ground like you.

120
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,855
Or in a tree,
the way you do.

121
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:19,235
And I'm sure no nest could
possibly be big enough for me.

122
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:22,947
Maybe you know
where I can stay.

123
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,533
In the woods somewhere?

124
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,785
You do?

125
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,080
Will you take me there?

126
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,585
Oh, it's adorable.

127
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,047
Just like a doll's house.

128
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:37,355
I like it here.

129
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:52,036
It's dark inside.

130
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,632
Guess there's no one home.

131
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,597
Hello?
May I come in?

132
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,851
Shh.

133
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,373
Oh!

134
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:42,628
What a cute little chair.

135
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,177
Why, there's seven little chairs.
Must be seven little children.

136
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:54,890
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

137
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:00,813
A pickax.
A stocking too.

138
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,069
And a shoe.

139
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:16,746
And just look at that fireplace.
It's covered with dust.

140
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,881
And look, cobwebs everywhere.

141
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,841
My, my, my!

142
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,802
What a pile of dirty dishes.

143
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,724
And just look at that broom.

144
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,227
Tsk, tsk, tsk!
Tsk, tsk, tsk!

145
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,146
Why, they've never
swept this room.

146
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,815
You'd think their mother would--

147
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,860
Maybe they have no mother.

148
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,197
Then, they're orphans.

149
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,616
That's too bad.

150
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:58,496
I know. We'll clean the house
and surprise them.

151
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,956
Then, maybe they'll let me stay.

152
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:09,840
Now, you wash the dishes.

153
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,426
You tidy up the room.

154
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,264
You clean the fireplace.
And I'll use the broom.

155
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,524
Just whistle
while you work

156
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,656
And cheerfully together
we can tidy up the place

157
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,950
So hum a merry tune

158
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:42,623
It won't take long
when there's a song
to help you set the pace

159
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:44,709
And as you sweep the room

160
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:49,505
Imagine that the broom
is someone that you love

161
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,550
And soon you'll find
you're dancing to the tune

162
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,303
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Put them in the tub.

163
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:59,265
When hearts are high
the time will fly

164
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,600
So whistle
while you work

165
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,737
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
Not under the rug.

166
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,119
So whistle
while you work

167
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:52,480
We dig, dig, dig, dig
dig, dig, dig

168
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,440
In our mine
the whole day through

169
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:59,028
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
is what we like to do

170
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,489
It ain't no trick
to get rich quick

171
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:03,866
If ya dig, dig, dig
with a shovel or a pick

172
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,077
-In a mine
-In a mine

173
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:08,329
-In a mine
-In a mine

174
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:13,250
-Where a million diamonds
-Shine

175
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:15,753
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

176
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,880
From early morn 'til night

177
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:22,343
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
Dig up everything in sight

178
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,845
We dig diamonds
by the score

179
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,181
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more

180
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,558
Though we don't know what
we dig 'em for

181
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,727
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

182
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:03,843
Heigh-ho

Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

Let's see what's upstairs.

198
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:59,667
Oh, what adorable little beds.

199
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:05,131
And look, they have
their names carved on them.

200
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,508
Doc, Happy,

201
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:09,176
Sneezy, Dopey--

202
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,388
What funny names for children.

203
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:16,517
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

204
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,147
I'm a little sleepy myself.

205
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,445
Oh, oh.

206
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:54,597
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

207
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:59,226

213
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,681
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:41,769
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's home from work we go

215
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,524
-Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh--
-Look!

216
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:52,405
Our house! The lit's light--
Uh, the light's lit.

217
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:00,204
Jiminy Crickets.

218
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:02,373
-The door is open.
-The chimney's smokin'.

219
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:04,417
-Something's in there.
-Maybe a ghost.
-Or a goblin.

220
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,585
-A demon.
-Or a dragon.

221
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:10,923
Mark my words,
there's trouble a-brewin'.

222
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:14,635
Felt it coming' all day.
My corns hurt.

223
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,846
-Gosh.
-That's a bad sign.

224
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:19,140
-What'll we do?
-Let's sneak it up on it.

225
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:21,225
Yes. Ahem,
we'll, uh, squeak up--

226
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,520
Sneak up. Come on, hen--
Uh, men. Follow me.

227
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:44,123
Psst.

228
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,272
Shh!

229
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,901
Shh!

230
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:15,780
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny--

231
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,949
Uh, hook and granny--
Uh, crooked fan--
Uh, search everywhere.

232
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:41,430
Shh! Quiet.

233
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:49,939
Look! The floor!
It's been swept!

234
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,486
Hah! Chair's been dusted.

235
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,322
Our window's been washed.

236
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:01,534
Gosh, our cobwebs are missin'.

237
00:29:02,076 --> 00:29:04,745
Why, why, why--
Why, the whole place is clean!

238
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,623
There's dirty work afoot.

239
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,459
Sink's empty.

240
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:14,005
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

241
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:17,508
They ain't stole. They're hid in the cupboard.

242
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,098
My cup's been washed.
Sugar's gone.

243
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,646
Something's cookin'.
Smells good.

244
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:34,775
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

245
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:40,323
See?
It's witch's brew.

246
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:44,493
Look what's happened
to our stable--uh, table.

247
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:47,330
Flowers!

248
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,583
-Huh?
-Look, goldenrod.

249
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,710
Don't do it.
Take them away. My nose!

250
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:55,338
My hay fever!
You know I can't stand it.

251
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:59,091
I can't--
I can't--I-- Oh!

252
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:01,510

Thanks.

254
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:10,603
Ah-chooooo!

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,483
Hey!

256
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:19,945

Ya crazy fool!
Fine time ya picked to sneeze!

258
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:26,994
I couldn't help it.
I can't tell.

259
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,915
When you gotta, you gotta.
I--I-- I gotta.

260
00:30:31,457 --> 00:30:34,794
I-It's comin'.
Ah-- Ah--

261
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:37,963
- Don't let him.

262
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:39,840
Oh, ah-- Ah-- Ah--

263
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:42,718
-Don't let go.
-Hold him tight.

264
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:44,887
-I'll tie it.
-Make a hard knot.

265
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:47,306
There, that'll hold him.

266
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,309
-Thanks!
-Shh!

267
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:53,813
Quiet, you fool.
Want to get us all killed?

268
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,154
-Wha-- What's that?
-That's it.

269
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:06,951
Sounded close.
It's in this room right now.

270
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:31,976
It's up there.
Yeah, in the bedroom.

271
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:37,231
One of us has got to go down...
and chase it up.

272
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,567
Uh, uh, uh, up, down.

273
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,211
Here, take it.

274
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,214
Don't be nervous.

275
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,942
Don't be afraid.
We're right behind you.

276
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,403
Yes, right behind ya.

277
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:07,113
Here it comes!

278
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:19,875
-It's after us!
-Don't let it out!
-Hold it shut!

279
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:34,181
-Here it comes.
-Now's our chance.

280
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:35,599
Hit it, now.

281
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:38,102
-Give it to 'im.
-Don't let him get away!

282
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:41,397
Take that, and that, and that!

283
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:45,151
Hold on there,
i-it's only Dopey.

284
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,902
-Did you see it?
-How big is it?

285
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,739
-Was it a dragon?
-Has it got horns?

286
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:51,782
-Was it breathing fire?
-Was it droolin'?

287
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:53,576
What was it doin'?

288
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:01,500
He's says it's...a monster...
asleep in our beds!

289
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:04,503
-Let's attack.
-While it's sleeping.
-Yeah, while it's sleeping.

290
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:07,048
-Hurry, men, it's now or never.
-Off with its head.

291
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:08,758
-Break its bones.
-Chop it to pieces.

292
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,259
We'll kill it dead.

293
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:39,288
-Jiminy Crickets.
-Gosh!

294
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:42,917
-Gee, what a monster.
-Covers three beds.

295
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:47,171
-Let's kill it before it wakes up.
-Which end do we kill?

296
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:48,422
-Shh!
-Shh!

297
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:19,078
-Well, uh, uh--
-What is it?

298
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:22,248
Why, i-it's a girl!

299
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,168
She's mighty pretty.

300
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:30,673
She's beautiful.
Just like a angel.

301
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,135
Angel, hah!
She's a female!

302
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:38,014
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles!

303
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:40,975
What are "wicked wiles"?

304
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,436
I don't know,
but I'm "agin" 'em.

305
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:47,148
Shh! Not so loud.
You'll wake her up.

306
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,859
Aw, let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow!

307
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:52,320
Look out. She's movin'.

308
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:53,779
-She's wakin' up.
-What do we do?

309
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:55,656
Hide!

310
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:01,704
Oh, dear!

311
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:05,708
I wonder if the children are--

312
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:10,129
Oh!

313
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:19,472
Why--Why, you're little men.

314
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,562
How do you do?

315
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:32,693
I said, "How do you do"?

316
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:34,987
How do ya do what?

317
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:38,199
Oh, you can talk.
I'm so glad.

318
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,452
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

319
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:45,373
I know, you're Doc.

320
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:48,542
Why-- Why--
Why, yes! Yes! That's true.

321
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:52,630
And you're--
You're Bashful.

322
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:55,925
Oh, gosh!

323
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:01,305
And, you? You're Sleepy.

324
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,140
How'd you guess?

325
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,228
-And you?
-Ah--

326
00:37:07,478 --> 00:37:09,480
Ah-- Ah-- Ah--

327
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:11,565
You're Sneezy.

328
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:14,610
Ah-choo!

329
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:19,824
-Yes, and you must be--
-Happy, ma'am. That's me.

330
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:22,076
And this is Dopey.
He don't talk none.

331
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:26,539
-You mean he can't talk?
-He don't know. He never tried.

332
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,667
Oh, that's too bad.

333
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:36,799
Oh, you must be Grumpy.

334
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:42,096
Oh, yeah.

335
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:43,514
Hah!
We know who we are.

336
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,933
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here!

337
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:49,228
Hmph! Yes! What are you
and who are you doin'?

338
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:52,273
Uh, uh, what are you--
Uh, who are you, my dear?

339
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:55,151
Oh, how silly of me.
I'm Snow White.

340
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,820
-Snow White? The Princess?
-Yes.

341
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:01,449
Well, my dear Quincess--

342
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:04,535
Uh, Princess. We're, uh--
We're honored. Yes, we're--

343
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:08,497
-Mad as hornets!
-"Mad as hornets!"
No, no, we're not!

344
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:11,834
We're bad as cornets--
No, no, as bad as--
What was I sayin'?

345
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,628
Nothin'! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

346
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:19,091
Who's butterin' like
a spoodledug? Who's uh, uh--

347
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,469
Aw, shut up!
And tell her to git out!

348
00:38:21,886 --> 00:38:25,431
Please, don't send me away.
If you do, she'll kill me.

349
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:26,640
-Kill you?
-Who will?
-Yes, who?

350
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:29,602
-My stepmother, the Queen.
-The Queen!

351
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,312
-She's wicked.
-She's bad.

352
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:34,982
-She's mighty mean.
-She's an old witch! I'm warnin' ya!

353
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:39,111
If the Queen finds her here,
she'll swoop down...

354
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,113
and wreak
her vengeance on us!

355
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:43,616
But she doesn't
know where I am.

356
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:46,911
She don't, huh?
She knows everything.

357
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,330
She's full of black magic.

358
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,084
She can even make
herself invisible. Pfft!

359
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:57,797
Might be in this room right now.

360
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:04,595
Oh, she'll never find me here.

361
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,890
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

362
00:39:08,224 --> 00:39:11,018
I'll wash, I'll cook...

363
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,480
Can ya make dapple lumpkins--
Uh, lumple dapplins--

364
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,190
Apple dumplings!

365
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:18,734
Ah, yes!
Crapple dumpkins.

366
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:21,112
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie--

367
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:24,407
Gooseberry pie?
Hurray! She stays!

368
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:47,847
Ah! Soup!

369
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:49,765
Hurray!

370
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:07,992
Uh, uh, uh, just a minute.

371
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:13,914
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

372
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,833
Wash?

373
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:20,004
Hah! Knew there's a catch to it!

374
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:25,676
-Why wash?
-What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

375
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,428
'Tain't New Year.

376
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,639
Oh, perhaps
you have washed.

377
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,558
Perhaps we--

378
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:37,897
But when?

379
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:42,318
When? Uh, when?
Uh, you said, "When?"

380
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:46,614
Why, last week-- uh, month--
year-- Why, recently.

381
00:40:48,616 --> 00:40:51,369
Yes, recently.

382
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:57,708
Let me see your hands.

383
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,258
Let me see your hands.

384
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:15,768
Why, Doc, I'm surprised.

385
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:25,486
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

386
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,906
And you? Tsk, tsk, tsk!

387
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,451
Worse than I thought.

388
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,453
Oh!

389
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,999
How shocking.

390
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,792
Tsk, tsk, tsk!

391
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:43,671
Goodness me, this will never do.

392
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:50,136
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

393
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:22,335
Hah!

394
00:42:25,171 --> 00:42:28,257
Well, aren't you going to wash?

395
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:33,095
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

396
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:45,483
Oh, did you hurt yourself?

397
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:46,984
Hmph!

398
00:42:57,787 --> 00:43:00,164
Hah, women!

399
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,834
Courage, men, courage!

400
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,379
Don't be nervous.

401
00:43:10,466 --> 00:43:11,801
Gosh, it's wet.

402
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:15,304
It's cold too!

403
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,641
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

404
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:21,519
Well, i-it'll please the Princess.

405
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:25,106
-I'll take a chance for her.
-Me too!

406
00:43:26,065 --> 00:43:29,193
Hah! Her wiles
are beginnin' to work.

407
00:43:29,652 --> 00:43:33,864
But I'm warnin' ya, you give 'em
an inch, and they'll walk all over ya!

408
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:37,576
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.

409
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,205
-How hard do ya scrub?
-Will our whiskers shrink?

410
00:43:41,414 --> 00:43:44,875
-Do ya get in the tub?
-Do ya have to wash where it doesn't show?

411
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:48,337
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

412
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:51,215
Step up to the tub
'Tain't no disgrace

413
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:54,051
Just pull up your sleeves
and get 'em in place

414
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:56,929
Then scoop up the water
and rub it on your face

415
00:43:57,138 --> 00:43:58,723
And go--

416
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,602
Pick up the soap
Now, don't try to bluff

417
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,272
Work up a lather
and when you got enough

418
00:44:06,522 --> 00:44:08,983
Get your hands full of water
and you snort and you snuff

419
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,735
And go--

420
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:15,072
You douse and you souse
Rub and ya scrub

421
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:18,159
You sputter and splash
all over the tub

422
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:21,078
You may be cold and wet
when you're done

423
00:44:21,287 --> 00:44:23,914
But ya gotta admit
it's good and clean fun

424
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,917
So splash all ya like
'Tain't any trick

425
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:30,046
As soon as you're through
you'll feel mighty slick

426
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:33,049
Bunch of old nanny goats
Ya make me sick

427
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:35,009
Going--

428
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:51,692
Hah!
Next thing ya know...

429
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:54,862
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons...

430
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:59,867
and smellin' ya up with that
stuff called, uh, "perfoom."

431
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:01,077
Hah!

432
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,063
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

433
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:34,402
I'd like to see anybody
make me wash, if I didn't wanna.

434
00:45:37,863 --> 00:45:38,906
Ahem.

435
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,102
Get him!

436
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:10,896
Hey! Let go of me!

437
00:46:11,439 --> 00:46:13,316
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

438
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:15,776
Let me loose, you fools!
Let me loose!

439
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,987
Get 'im up on the tub.
Get 'im up! Hang onto 'im!

440
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:20,531
Get him up on the tub.
The tub, the tub!

441
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:23,284
Don't get excited!
Don't get--

442
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,376
Get the soap!

443
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:44,055
Oh! Steady, men!

444
00:46:44,055 --> 00:46:45,056
We'll get him there.

445
00:47:18,964 --> 00:47:21,133
Now scrub good and hard
It can't be denied

446
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:23,844
That he'll look mighty cute
as soon as he's dried

447
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:26,180
Well, it's good for the soul
and it's good for the hide

448
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,932
To go--

449
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:48,077
-Ain't he sweet?
-Smells like a petunia.

450
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:50,788
He sure is cute.

451
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:53,457
You'll pay dearly for this!

452
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,210
Supper!

453
00:47:57,086 --> 00:47:59,255
-Supper!
-Food! Hurray!

454
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:05,344
Hah!

455
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,946
Magic mirror on the wall,

456
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:28,034
who now is
the fairest one of all?

457
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:31,787
Over the seven jewelled hills,

458
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:34,248
beyond the seventh fall,

459
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:36,876
in the cottage
of the Seven Dwarfs,

460
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:42,089
dwells Snow White,
fairest one of all.

461
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:47,011
Snow White lies dead
in the forest.

462
00:48:47,303 --> 00:48:50,014
The Huntsman has brought me proof.

463
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:53,976
Behold, her heart.

464
00:48:54,352 --> 00:48:56,729
Snow White still lives,

465
00:48:57,063 --> 00:48:59,315
the fairest in the land.

466
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:04,487
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

467
00:49:04,737 --> 00:49:06,864
The heart of a pig!

468
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:08,908
Then I've been tricked!

469
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:37,395
The heart of a pig!
The blundering fool!

470
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:40,982
I'll go myself
to the dwarfs' cottage...

471
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:46,278
in a disguise so complete
no one will ever suspect.

472
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:55,204
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness.

473
00:49:55,579 --> 00:50:00,042
Change my queenly raiment
to a peddler's cloak.

474
00:50:01,127 --> 00:50:04,588
"Mummy Dust" to make me old.

475
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:09,135
To shroud my clothes, the black of night.

476
00:50:12,388 --> 00:50:17,184
To age my voice,
an old hag's cackle.

477
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:29,196
To whiten my hair,
a scream of fright.

478
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:35,369
A blast of wind...

479
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:39,040
to fan my hate!

480
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:42,835
A thunderbolt...

481
00:50:44,003 --> 00:50:47,298
to mix it well.

482
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:49,467
Now...

483
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:53,763
begin thy magic spell.

484
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:20,956
Look! My hands!

485
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:31,425
My voice!
My voice!

486
00:51:35,805 --> 00:51:39,350
A perfect disguise.

487
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:46,816
And now, a special...

488
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:51,612
sort of death for one so fair.

489
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:54,365
What shall it be?

490
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:59,286
Ah! A poisoned apple!

491
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:02,289
"Sleeping Death."

492
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,211
"One taste
of the Poisoned Apple...

493
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:11,173
"and the victim's eyes
will close forever...

494
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:16,137
in the Sleeping Death."

495
00:53:01,766 --> 00:53:02,475
Ahem!

496
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,395
I'd like to dance and tap my feet
but they don't keep in rhythm

497
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,524
You see, I washed 'em both today
and I can't do nothin' with 'em

498
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:14,362
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

499
00:53:14,654 --> 00:53:18,449
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing

500
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:41,889
Oh, g-gosh!

501
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:49,063
I chased a polecat up a tree
Way out upon a limb

502
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:53,025
And when he got the best of me
I got the worst of him

503
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:56,988
Ho-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

504
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:01,075
Isn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing

505
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:16,382
Ahhh

506
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:13,981
Be careful.
Watch out.

507
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:15,608
Be-- Be care--
Watch it! Watch it!

508
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:17,985
Watch--
Watch-- Ah--

509
00:55:19,737 --> 00:55:21,238
Thanks.

510
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,662
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

511
00:56:29,432 --> 00:56:31,851
Ah-ch-- Ah-ch--
Ah-- Ah--

512
00:56:32,435 --> 00:56:36,022
Ah-ch--
Ah-ch-- Ah-ch--

513
00:56:39,317 --> 00:56:41,819
Ah-- Ah--
Ah-chooooo!

514
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,922
That was fun.

515
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:05,885
-Now, you do somethin'.
-Well, what shall I do?

516
00:57:06,135 --> 00:57:09,138
-Tell us a story.
-Yes! Tell us a story!

517
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:12,725
-A true story.
-A love story.

518
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,854
Well, once there was a princess.

519
00:57:17,146 --> 00:57:19,065
Was the princess you?

520
00:57:19,315 --> 00:57:22,318
-And she fell in love.
-Was it hard to do?

521
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:27,823
Oh, it was very easy.
Anyone could see that the prince was charming.

522
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:32,536
-The only one for me.
-Was he, uh, strong and handsome?

523
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:34,664
Was he big and tall?

524
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:38,626
There's nobody like him...
anywhere at all.

525
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:42,380
-Did he say he loved ya?
-Did he steal a kiss?

526
00:57:42,797 --> 00:57:46,634
He was so romantic

527
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:51,597
I could not resist

528
00:58:00,147 --> 00:58:06,445
Some day
my Prince will come

529
00:58:06,988 --> 00:58:12,159
Some day we'll meet again

530
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:15,913
And away to his castle

531
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,749
We'll go

532
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:22,628
To be happy forever

533
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,132
I know

534
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:29,093
Hah! Mush.

535
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:34,640
Some day when spring is here

536
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:40,938
We'll find our love anew

537
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:46,569
And the birds will sing

538
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:52,450
And wedding bells will ring

539
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:59,623
Some day when my dreams

540
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:04,295
Come true

541
00:59:16,015 --> 00:59:19,477
Oh, my goodness,
it's past bedtime.

542
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,479
Go right upstairs to bed.

543
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:26,525
Wait! Hold on there, men.

544
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:32,865
The, uh, Princess will
sleep in our beds upstairs.

545
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:35,785
-But... where will you sleep?
- Oh, we'll be quite
comfortable down here..

546
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:40,331
- in, uh, in, uh--
- In a pig's eye!

547
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:43,584
"In a pig's eye--"
Sty-- No! No! I mean--

548
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:47,046
We'll be comfortable,
won't we, men?

549
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:50,007
Oh, yes, mighty comfortable.

550
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:52,426
Now, don't you
worry about us.

551
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:56,222
-We'll be all right.
-Go right up now,
uh, uh, my dear.

552
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:00,643
Well, if you insist.

553
01:00:02,103 --> 01:00:03,771
Good night.

554
01:00:04,146 --> 01:00:06,107
Good night, Princess.

555
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:10,778
You're sure
you'll be comfortable?

556
01:00:11,237 --> 01:00:14,323
Oh, yes,
very comfortable.

557
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:17,201
Well, pleasant dreams.

558
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,204
Pleasant dreams.

559
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:27,086
-Let go!
-Now, men, don't get excited. Remember...

560
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:29,964
share and share alike.

561
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:31,757
Look out, it'll rip!

562
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:48,816
Bless the seven little men...

563
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:51,360
who have been so kind to me.

564
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:55,406
And may my dreams come true.

565
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:57,491
Amen.

566
01:00:58,826 --> 01:01:02,079
Oh, yes, and please make
Grumpy like me.

567
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:04,999
Hah!
Women!

568
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:12,798
A fine kettle of fish.

569
01:02:57,528 --> 01:03:00,406
Dip the apple in the brew.

570
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:04,744
Let the sleeping death seep through.

571
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:18,007
Look! On the skin!

572
01:03:18,466 --> 01:03:22,470
The symbol of what lies within.

573
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:27,808
Now, turn red
to tempt Snow White.

574
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,020
To make her hunger for a bite.

575
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:35,733
Have a bite?

576
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:40,571
It's not for you!

577
01:03:40,905 --> 01:03:42,865
It's for Snow White.

578
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:49,205
When she breaks the tender peel
to taste the apple in my hand,

579
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:53,209
her breath will still,
her blood congeal.

580
01:03:53,626 --> 01:03:57,963
Then I'll be the fairest in the land.

581
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,801
But wait!

582
01:04:02,802 --> 01:04:05,137
There may be an antidote.

583
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:07,640
Nothing must be overlooked.

584
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:12,895
Ah! Here it is!

585
01:04:13,437 --> 01:04:16,107
"The Victim
of the Sleeping Death...

586
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:21,821
can be revived only
by Love's First Kiss."

587
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,157
"Love's First Kiss"!

588
01:04:25,533 --> 01:04:28,995
Bah! No fear of that.

589
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:32,164
The dwarfs
will think she's dead.

590
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:35,626
She'll be buried alive!

591
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:50,808
Buried alive!

592
01:05:01,694 --> 01:05:04,989
Thirsty?
Have a drink!

593
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:06,967
Now, don't forget, my dear.

594
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:10,012
Th-The old Queen's a sly one.

595
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:14,433
Full of witchcraft.
So beware of strangers.

596
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:17,395
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.

597
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:23,985
-See you tonight.
-Oh, oh, yes.

598
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:26,737
Well, uh, come on, men.

599
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:34,912
Be awful careful, 'cuse
if anything would happen to you,

600
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:37,373
-I-- I--
-Good-bye.

601
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:40,751
Oh, gosh!

602
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:44,714
Hah! Disgustin'!

603
01:06:45,423 --> 01:06:48,509
And be sure to watch out--
To wa-- To wa--

604
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:50,261
To wa--
Watch out!

605
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,599
Thanks.
Ah-ch-- Ah-ch-ch--

606
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:59,520
Ah-ch--
Ah-chooooo!

607
01:07:23,669 --> 01:07:26,172
Well... all right.

608
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:29,967
But that's the last--

609
01:07:32,303 --> 01:07:35,056
Oh!
Go on. Run along.

610
01:07:36,182 --> 01:07:40,061
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

611
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:43,606
Heigh-ho

612
01:07:43,773 --> 01:07:46,108
Good-bye. Good-bye!

613
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:52,281
Now, I'm warnin' ya. Don't let
nobody or nothin' in the house.

614
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:56,160
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

615
01:08:19,058 --> 01:08:20,101
Huh!

616
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:37,535
Good-bye, Grumpy!

617
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:50,798
The little men will be away...

618
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:53,759
and she'll be alone...

619
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:59,015
with a harmless
old peddler woman.

620
01:09:00,224 --> 01:09:03,728
A harmless old peddler woman.

621
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:18,034
Some day my Prince will come

622
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:23,331
Some day we'll meet again

623
01:09:23,914 --> 01:09:29,211
And away to his castle we'll go

624
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:35,176
To be happy forever I know

625
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:41,307
Some day when spring is here

626
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:46,771
We'll find our love anew

627
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:51,233
And the birds will sing

628
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:56,447
And wedding bells will ring

629
01:09:56,947 --> 01:10:01,035
Some day when my dreams

630
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:04,830
Come true

631
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:14,965
All alone, my pet?

632
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:17,802
Why-- Why, yes, I am, but--

633
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:22,390
The... little men are not here?

634
01:10:22,682 --> 01:10:25,351
No, they're not, but--

635
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:27,812
Mm-hmm.

636
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:30,314
Makin' pies?

637
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:32,817
Yes, gooseberry pie.

638
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:38,322
It's apple pies that make
the menfolks' mouths water.

639
01:10:39,407 --> 01:10:44,578
Pies made from apples like these.

640
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:48,833
-Oh, they do look delicious.
-Yes!

641
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:53,129
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

642
01:10:57,133 --> 01:11:00,511
Like to try one?
Hmm?

643
01:11:01,262 --> 01:11:05,308
Go on.
Go on, have a bite.

644
01:11:07,685 --> 01:11:09,103
Ah! Ah!

645
01:11:12,023 --> 01:11:15,526
Stop it, stop it.
Go away, go away.

646
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:18,195
Shame on you, frightening
a poor old lady.

647
01:11:19,405 --> 01:11:23,034
Oh, I thought I lost it.

648
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:26,579
There, there.
I'm sorry.

649
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:29,582
Oh! My heart!

650
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:32,877
Oh, my--
My poor heart.

651
01:11:33,294 --> 01:11:36,672
Take me into the house
and let me rest.

652
01:11:37,048 --> 01:11:39,508
A drink of water, please.

653
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:13,209
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho
Heigh-ho

654
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,628
Heigh-ho
It's off to work we go

655
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:20,675
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

656
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:36,691
Hey, look!

657
01:12:41,654 --> 01:12:44,824
Stop that. Get away!
Get away! Go on, shoo!

658
01:12:45,408 --> 01:12:46,492
Go on, get outta here!

659
01:12:51,956 --> 01:12:54,166
What ails these crazy birds?

660
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:56,419
Th-They've gone plumb daffy.

661
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,254
Yeah, they've gone--
Ah-- Ah--

662
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,881
Ah-chooooo!

663
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:07,888
And because you've been
so good to poor old Granny.

664
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:11,267
I'll share a secret with you.

665
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:13,936
This is no ordinary apple.

666
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,897
It's a magic wishing apple.

667
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:20,860
-A wishing apple?
-Yes!

668
01:13:21,402 --> 01:13:25,990
One bite and all
your dreams will come true.

669
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,327
-Really?
-Yes, girlie!

670
01:13:30,411 --> 01:13:34,040
Now, make a wish and take a bite.

671
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,335
Go on, git! These pesky critters
won't stop!

672
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:39,045
'Taint natural.
There's something wrong!

673
01:13:39,503 --> 01:13:41,339
They ain't actin' this way
for nothin'!

674
01:13:42,506 --> 01:13:45,843
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

675
01:13:46,135 --> 01:13:47,720
-The Queen!
-Snow White!

676
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:49,805
The Queen will kill her!
We gotta save her!

677
01:13:50,431 --> 01:13:52,683
Yes, yes,
we-we gotta save her!

678
01:13:53,059 --> 01:13:56,228
-S-She'll kill her!
-What'll we do?
-Yes, w-what'll we do?

679
01:13:56,604 --> 01:13:59,523
Come on!
Giddap!

680
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:11,577
Wait for me!
Wait--

681
01:14:26,717 --> 01:14:30,721
There must be something
your little heart desires.

682
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:33,849
Perhaps there's someone you love.

683
01:14:34,266 --> 01:14:36,435
Well, there is someone.

684
01:14:36,686 --> 01:14:39,689
I thought so.
I thought so.

685
01:14:40,064 --> 01:14:43,651
Old Granny knows
a young girl's heart.

686
01:14:43,985 --> 01:14:48,322
Now, take the apple, dearie,
and make a wish.

687
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:53,661
I wish--
I wish--

688
01:14:53,828 --> 01:14:55,955
That's it.
Go on. Go on.

689
01:15:09,427 --> 01:15:12,221
..and that he will
carry me away to his castle...

690
01:15:13,597 --> 01:15:16,767
where we will live
happily ever after.

691
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:19,729
Fine! Fine!
Now, take a bite.

692
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:26,444
Don't let the wish grow cold!

693
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:31,407
Oh! I feel strange.

694
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:35,661
-Her breath will still.
-Oh.

695
01:15:37,705 --> 01:15:41,417
-Her blood congeal.
-Oh.

696
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:55,723
Now I'll be fairest in the land!

697
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,733
Hurry, hurry!

698
01:16:11,364 --> 01:16:12,448
There she goes!

699
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:33,844
After her!

700
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:06,293
I'm trapped.
What will I do?

701
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,839
The meddling little fools!

702
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:22,268
I'll fix ya!
I'll crush your bones!

703
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:25,229
Look out!

704
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:36,652
-One song
-One song

705
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:48,247
-One song only for you
-One song only for you

706
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:54,879
One heart tenderly beating

707
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:59,967
-Ever entreating
-Ever entreating

708
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:03,512
Constant and true

709
01:20:03,721 --> 01:20:05,014
So true

710
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:08,517
-One love
-One love

711
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:12,480
That has possessed me

712
01:20:13,522 --> 01:20:16,233
-One love
-One love

713
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:21,739
-Thrilling me through
-So true

714
01:20:22,031 --> 01:20:24,742
-One song
-One song

715
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:30,206
-My heart keeps singing
-Keeps singing

716
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:35,586
-Of one love
-One love

717
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:43,010
Only for you

718
01:21:08,953 --> 01:21:11,497
And away to his castle

719
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:14,583
You'll go

720
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:17,712
To be happy forever

721
01:21:18,212 --> 01:21:20,923
We know

722
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:00,087
Good-bye.

723
01:22:03,341 --> 01:22:04,842
Good-bye, Grumpy.

724
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:07,261
Good-bye.

725
01:22:14,018 --> 01:22:17,146
Oh, Dopey.

726
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,193
Good-bye!

727
01:22:38,209 --> 01:22:43,255
Some day when spring is here

728
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:48,719
We'll find our love anew

729
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:53,099
And the birds will sing

730
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:57,311
And wedding bells will ring

731
01:22:58,104 --> 01:23:02,149
Some day when my dreams

732
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:07,071
Come true

733
01:23:09,907 --> 01:23:18,249
