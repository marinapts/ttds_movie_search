3
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,082
He looks just like me.

4
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,456
I feel like I'm seeing double.

5
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:07,563
I have impersonated you
for a long time,

6
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,631
but he is a miracle.

7
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,733
Where did you find him?

8
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,208
At the execution grounds.

9
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,970
The execution grounds?

10
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,187
He was going to be crucified.

11
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:37,825
I thought he would be useful
as a double for you.

12
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,425
What did he do?

13
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:49,534
He was caught stealing.
He's a thief.

14
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,206
A thief?

15
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:01,553
And a tough one.
Torture failed to make him talk.

16
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,989
Besides stealing,
he may have also killed.

17
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,720
What did the prosecutors say

18
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:15,595
about his resemblance to me?

19
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,367
Nothing.

20
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:25,802
Only l, your brother,
could see it from the start.

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,910
His hair, his clothes, the way he talked
were all so different.

22
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,447
No one had the slightest idea

23
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,720
of his resemblance to our lord.

24
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:49,295
Even l, who recognized
the resemblance,

25
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:54,839
am doubly amazed at the likeness
once we dressed him like you.

26
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,040
Where is he from?

27
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,079
As you see,

28
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,343
he is very much like you.

29
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:14,058
I wondered if our father
might have had another son somewhere.

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,934
But do not fear.
He is a drifter from the north.

31
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,205
He could not be our half brother.

32
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,975
Even with this resemblance,
Nobukado,

33
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:42,052
he is so wicked as to be
sentenced to crucifixion.

34
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,885
How could this scoundrel
be my double?

35
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,293
Quiet!

36
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:01,667
I only stole a few coins.
I'm a petty thief.

37
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:06,401
A man who's killed hundreds

38
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,881
and robbed whole domains
is hardly the one...

39
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,119
is hardly the one...

40
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,655
to call...

41
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,665
to call me a scoundrel.

42
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,325
Hold your tongue!

43
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,601
I was going to be crucified.

44
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,536
My life could have ended this very day!

45
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,640
Threats...

46
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:54,090
Threats don't mean a fart to me!
Boil me, broil me, for all I care!

47
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,028
Very well.

48
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,298
Whatever you wish to say, say it.

49
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,943
If you will not say it, I will.

50
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,650
I am wicked, as you say.
I am a scoundrel.

51
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,389
I banished my own father

52
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,021
and killed my own son.

53
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:38,468
I will do anything
to rule this country.

54
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,799
War is everywhere.

55
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:49,843
Unless somebody unifies
the nation and reigns over us,

56
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,883
we will see more rivers of blood

57
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,586
and more mountains of the dead.

58
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,548
It is cold.

59
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:33,050
My old wound hurts
when the air is cold.

60
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:40,890
Nobukado, he has spoken boldly.

61
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,468
He might be of some use.
Train him.

62

KAGEMUSHA

1573

64
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,244
Sire,

65
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,144
we've cut off the water
entering the castle.

66
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:56,329
The castle is now sure to fall.

67
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,100
I would like to think so.

68
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,603
We thought a little push would do it,
but they've held out for 20 days.

69
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:09,138
They're not likely to surrender
just because their water line is cut.

70
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,044
Indeed.

71
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,481
We breach their outer
and inner perimeters,

72
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,447
and they calmly hole up in the keep.

73
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,322
Someone plays the flute every night.

74
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,830
And he plays well.

75
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:32,136
Our men are impressed.
They can't wait for night to come.

76
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:33,939
That's right.

77
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,471
Listen!

78
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:43,046
We must let my father know
we've cut the aqueduct.

79
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,080
Your father Lord Shingen
is right here.

80
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,579
Except for us chief vassals,

81
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:56,591
not only the enemy, but our own men
believe the lord is here.

82
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:00,721
It would not do
to send messengers to him.

83
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,509
Sire, Masakage Yamagata is here.

84
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,082
Send him in.

85
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,729
Leave us alone.

86
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,273
My lord,
I trust you are in good spirits.

87
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,850
No!

88
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:45,268
Asakura sent me a message.
He is returning to his fief.

89
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,073
His men are weary
and it is midwinter.

90
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,469
Nobunaga's men are tired, too.

91
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,478
If Asakura retreats,

92
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:03,145
Nobunaga will reinforce
leyasu Tokugawa and block my way.

93
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:07,485
Asakura's retreat is treason against me.

94
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,225
How old are you, sire?

95
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:21,034
Fifty-three, as I remember.
- Why?

96
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:27,908
Yet you still behave
like a five-year-old child!

97
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,175
People gather and scatter.

98
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:36,981
They go left and right,
following their interests.

99
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,956
You know that very well,
yet you lose yourself in anger.

100
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,354
How I weep for you!

101
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:50,833
A man of such small mind
cannot dream of ruling.

102
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,972
Go back to your own domain.

103
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,700
You are a mountain monkey.

104
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,539
You should be gathering nuts
in the mountains of Kai!

105
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,476
That's enough.

106
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,382
What has brought you here?

107
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,088
We've cut the aqueduct.

108
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,196
Will the castle fall soon?

109
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,864
I wonder.

110
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,441
There will be rain and snow.

111
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,803
Then the castle may stand
a little longer.

112
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,374
The garrison leader is a fine warrior.

113
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:43,280
He has someone
play a flute at night.

114
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,021
I've heard about that flute.

115
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,922
Will the flute play again tonight,

116
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,400
even with their water cut?

117
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,402
If we hear him tonight,

118
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,631
the garrison will hold.

119
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,071
The castle will not fall.

120
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:10,576
But if we do not hear the flute,
the castle is doomed.

121
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:14,582
Its fall is near.

122
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:19,019
I want to hear for myself
if the flute is played tonight.

123
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,124
Prepare a seat for me
at the castle.

124
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,095
- What was that?
- What happened?

125
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,873
What? Lord Shingen was shot?

126
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,153
A sniper shot him.

127
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,812
He was badly wounded.

128
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,153
- We don't know if he still lives?
- Correct, sire.

129
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,763
Either way, it is a perfect opportunity
for our Tokugawa clan.

130
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,193
Quiet.

131
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:12,369
Even if he did beat me
at the battle of Mikata,

132
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,631
I am no coward.
His death does not please me.

133
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:32,681
As a warlord,
he has been unrivaled.

134
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,087
He is just over 50.

135
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,229
If he is really dead,

136
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,633
it is a great loss.

137
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,971
My lord.

138
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,571
With Asai and Asakura in Otani,

139
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,279
the shogun in Kyoto,

140
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,817
the Ikkou uprising in Ishiyama,

141
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,978
and Shingen in Mikawa,

142
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,959
Lord Nobunaga
must wage battle on all four sides.

143
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,864
As his ally, it is only natural

144
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,729
that we rejoice
in Shingen's misfortune.

145
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,629
At any rate,

146
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,934
we should immediately send word
to Lord Nobunaga.

147
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,168
That should not be necessary.

148
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:30,941
News such as this
could not have escaped his ears.

149
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,511
In fact,

150
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,822
it would be unlike him
to miss a single move of Shingen's.

151
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,063
What? Shingen is dead?

152
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,636
According to our spy,

153
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,176
there is a rumor
that he was shot and killed.

154
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,041
Fool! I have no use for rumors.

155
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,083
I need facts.
Is he alive or is he dead?

156
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,277
Bring me my stool.

157
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,588
There is only one thing
in the world that can frighten me:

158
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,995
that mountain monkey.

159
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,864
He's been standing in my way.

160
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,634
His death would be a boon.

161
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,042
I could march to Kyoto,
relaxed and at ease.

162
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:41,417
So spare no effort.
Find out if he lives or dies. Understand?

163
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,750
My horse!

164
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,428
What?

165
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,594
Lord Shingen is dead?

166
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,248
We have lost a great leader.

167
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,098
He was truly...

168
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,236
a heroic man.

169
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:27,574
We came all this way and took the castle.
Why retreat now?

170
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,815
There must be a reason.

171
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,183
I heard a rumor.

172
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,925
Our lord's been shot.

173
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,790
Open your eyes
and look for yourself.

174
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,697
Lord Shingen is

175
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,835
right over there.

176
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,239
To occupy Kyoto...

177
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:37,753
to fly my flags in the capital...

178
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:46,862
has been my long-cherished dream.

179
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,965
But...

180
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:59,742
if something should happen to me,

181
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,510
do not pursue that dream.

182
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,153
Remember.

183
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:18,929
My death must not be made known.

184
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,926
Keep it a secret

185
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,036
for at least three years.

186
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:34,472
Guard our domain.
Never move from it.

187
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,040
Do not move.

188
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:47,524
If you ignore my order
and set out to attack,

189
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,359
our Takeda clan will be no more.

190
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,200
Heed my words!

191
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,597
This...

192
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:10,210
is my final wish.

193
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,215
Father.

194
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,886
But I am not going to die.

195
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,491
I said "if."

196
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:28,396
I must be prepared for the worst.

197
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,899
But no...

198
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,470
I will not die.

199
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,010
The lancet holes of the castle
were like this.

200
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,612
And the target?

201
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:29,487
Beneath the second rampart,
up the steps from the outer wall.

202
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,828
Taking this spot as an example,

203
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,791
that pine tree

204
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,463
is the same distance and direction.

205
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,700
You saw Takeda's men
prepare a seat there during the day?

206
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:51,673
They put up three bamboo poles
with white paper.

207
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,920
I thought an enemy lord
might go there to listen to the flute.

208
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,920
I set up my gun during the day.

209
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,655
Do as you did then.

210
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,859
I set the barrel against the corner

211
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,861
and dropped a plumb line.

212
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,022
I set up my aim like this
and waited for the night.

213
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,956
Shoot.

214
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,862
Go ahead. Shoot.

215
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,674
It was dark,
no bonfires or anything,

216
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,283
so I could not see.

217
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,195
Some time after the flute began,

218
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:29,034
I pulled the trigger like this.

219
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,012
Then what?

220
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,522
As soon as I fired,

221
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,887
noises came from the spot
where I had aimed,

222
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,051
just like now.

223
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,822
Calm them.

224
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:03,106
Now we can believe
that Shingen was wounded.

225
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,536
Not yet.

226
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,309
If he was,

227
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,339
the Takeda army would have
annihilated the enemy.

228
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:18,648
They would have tried
to kill this sniper at the very least.

229
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,721
No.

230
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:27,427
They want to keep it a secret.
They would not.

231
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,028
They made peace
when they had almost won

232
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,000
and returned home.

233
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,105
There's something very strange...

234
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,537
about this sudden turn.

235
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,843
It could be a ruse.

236
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,956
If we press on too long,
it could aggravate his wound.

237
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,027
We should stop for a rest.

238
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,778
My lord.

239
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,456
My lord.

240
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:27,082
Have we crossed the Seta bridge?

241
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,685
I can see Kyoto.

242
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:38,228
Occupy it!
Fly my flags over the capital!

243
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,363
My lord!

244
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,329
Our lord?

245
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,261
I cannot see him yet,

246
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,198
but what a beautiful sight!

247
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,735
Takeda's finest,
marching in perfect step.

248
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,172
Keep in formation!

249
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,664
I know it was my father's last wish,

250
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,177
but I don't think
we can keep his death a secret.

251
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:46,105
Some saw his body in the palanquin.

252
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,182
Don't worry.
I took care of those who might talk.

253
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,982
But there are spies
from Nobunaga and leyasu.

254
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,623
We must observe your father's wishes.

255
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,228
We must try our best.

256
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,421
That's right.

257
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:07,801
Nobukado impersonated
our late lord many times in battle.

258
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,972
The enemy has never known.

259
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,435
We must deceive our own men too.

260
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:19,275
But even Nobukado cannot do that.
The secret would get out.

261
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,678
He is right.

262
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:27,818
I cannot carry it off by myself.

263
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:34,321
But if we brought in
another double of the lord,

264
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,364
it would change things.

265
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,331
Another double?

266
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,095
Exactly.

267
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:45,008
I have prepared for such an occasion.

268
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,670
Take a look at him.

269
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,454
Enter!

270
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,744
Remove your mask.

271
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,866
Where is the lord?

272
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,769
You were born base!

273
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:08,085
The lord doesn't often receive
the likes of you!

274
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,617
Make way for the lord!

275
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,991
Make way for the lord!

276
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,134
- You saw him?
- Yes.

277
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,774
I think it's Shingen.

278
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,541
Let's have a closer look.
It might be a double.

279
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,837
I'm sure it is Shingen.

280
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,395
Did leyasu send you?

281
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,401
Nobunaga sent me.

282
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,333
I don't understand.

283
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,944
I found a guarded palanquin
hurrying north.

284
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,279
I thought it had to be Shingen,
so I tailed it.

285
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:58,821
A doctor traveled with it.
I thought Shingen was wounded.

286
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,648
But look at that.

287
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,751
Shingen was not in the palanquin.

288
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,363
Listen.

289
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:16,871
The party rested
and then rejoined the main force.

290
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:27,850
And the doctor's assistant
was killed on the pass.

291
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,822
It doesn't make sense.

292
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,692
Why did they turn back?

293
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:43,323
Why did the assistant
have to be killed?

294
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,041
But it is Shingen.

295
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,982
No doubt about it.

296
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:14,591
That's right.
It is Shingen himself.

297
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,720
Do not push your luck!

298
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,428
What if someone saw you just now?

299
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,028
Impossible!

300
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,967
He was dying before.
Now he's healthy.

301
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,504
You don't know the truth.

302
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,550
Are your spies blind
or old men whose senses have failed?

303
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:26,256
Shingen must have some reason

304
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,625
for pulling back so abruptly
after reaching Mikawa.

305
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,225
He is either dead

306
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,729
or wounded.

307
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,540
Otherwise, he'd be pressing on
toward Kyoto,

308
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,872
and he'd have surrounded us by now.

309
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,411
Don't move!

310
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,912
Identify yourself!

311
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,307
You've disappointed me.

312
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,719
Of all things,
trying to steal and escape.

313
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:24,489
I can play this role of double
from time to time.

314
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:29,727
But not from morning till night.

315
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:31,961
It is too much.

316
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,230
Besides,

317
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:41,074
the lord is already dead!

318
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,572
You lied to me! You tricked me!

319
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,045
Shut up!

320
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,580
Do as you are told!

321
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:51,721
I'm not a puppet!
You can't control me!

322
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,412
Come, come.

323
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,553
There is a good reason for it.

324
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,859
We must keep
the lord's death a secret,

325
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,936
as was his wish.

326
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:12,007
What do you mean, keep it a secret?

327
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,837
We must pretend he is alive.

328
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,639
But these three know.

329
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:25,879
Those who were close to him
had to know.

330
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,485
I intended to tell you too

331
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,492
that I wanted you
to continue this role.

332
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,655
No more. I cannot.

333
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,927
- Do not be obstinate.
- It's not that.

334
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:42,900
I...

335
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:48,533
I don't feel like it anymore,
now that I know he's dead.

336
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,304
Listen!

337
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,742
He asked us to conceal his death

338
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:59,685
so he could live three more years
for the sake of the Takeda clan!

339
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:05,487
If you cared for your lord at all,
now is the time to serve him!

340
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,791
Perhaps you are right.

341
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:15,065
But I thought he was alive.

342
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,139
Then I found him dead.

343
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,067
Suddenly, it all seems so stupid!

344
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,734
He's hopeless!

345
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,347
We cannot use him!

346
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,947
There is no other way.

347
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:36,052
Only he can deceive everyone,
even those in our camp.

348
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,934
Listen.

349
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:51,004
If you refuse to play the lord's role,
you will die.

350
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,170
Now that you've seen him dead,
we can't let you live.

351
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,050
But if you do this for us,

352
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:06,850
you will be rewarded
and released in three years.

353
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:11,790
You owe your life to Lord Nobukado.

354
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,560
Now he is asking you to help him.

355
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,028
Enough!

356
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:21,831
No matter what you say,
he will never understand us.

357
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,933
When you think about it,

358
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:31,171
why should he care one whit

359
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,078
about the Takeda clan?

360
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:38,481
It is selfish of us to force him
to solve our problems.

361
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:42,421
This role is for someone

362
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:46,858
who is willing to die
for the Takeda clan.

363
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,350
Release him.

364
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,156
Are you mad?

365
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:25,801
If he goes free,
then everyone will know.

366
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:29,428
We cannot prevent that.

367
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,637
Tomorrow, we reach Suwa.

368
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:39,613
We will bury the lord's body
in Lake Suwa as he wished.

369
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:45,720
This is no time for killing.

370
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,983
The next day we reach Fuchu.

371
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:52,227
It will be a sad march home
without our lord.

372
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,953
Let us plan for it now.

373
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,320
What are they doing?

374
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,321
What's in that jar?

375
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,526
Strange.

376
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,397
The jar is gone.

377
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:17,557
What happened?

378
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,073
I've got it.

379
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:36,483
I thought the jar contained treasure,
but I was wrong.

380
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,178
They would not abandon that.

381
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:43,519
And the Takeda warriors
were behaving strangely.

382
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:47,925
I am sure the jar
contained Shingen's body.

383
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,564
In that case,

384
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,967
the man we saw
from the mountain was his double?

385
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:57,538
It had to be.

386
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:11,519
Quick!

387
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:15,547
Three spies were in that hut!

388
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,758
They saw everything!
Send your men to kill them!

389
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,021
Go away!

390
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:24,598
We're going to tell
our soldiers of his death today.

391
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,732
Naturally,
the enemy will know at once.

392
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,569
I said go away!

393
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,498
What do you want?

394
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,538
You looking to be paid?

395
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,845
No!

396
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:16,442
Let me help you.

397
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,383
I want no reward.
Make use of me.

398
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,437
I want to be of use to him.

399
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,681
Use me!

400
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,378
I beg you!

401
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,191
Please, let me help!

402
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,674
"A jar of sake was offered
to the god of the lake this morning."

403
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:45,606
What did it say?

404
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,933
What a disappointment.

405
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:52,804
The jar contained sake.

406
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,244
Sake?

407
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,279
It was offered
to the god of the lake.

408
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,154
Damn!

409
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:05,553
Then is Shingen alive?

410
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,127
Wait.

411
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:13,765
There will be a Noh performance tonight
to celebrate the victory.

412
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,336
We will see if the lord is real.

413
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:58,251
This is indeed a lucky day.

414
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,088
Boys' Festival,

415
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,389
and now the return
of your grandfather.

416
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:05,327
Two good things in one day.

417
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,765
Will my father come home, too?

418
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:09,599
Yes.

419
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:14,532
But you are the lord's heir,

420
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,703
so you must greet the lord first.

421
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,314
I know.

422
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,781
Grandfather
is the most important person here.

423
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:27,283
And you come after him.

424
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:31,517
Why do I come before my father?

425
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:37,833
I do not know.

426
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:43,060
Lord Katsuyori, your father,
is your guardian.

427
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:48,336
You are his charge
until you come of age.

428
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:49,603
Hurry.

429
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,510
The heralds are at the gate.

430
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,240
At once.

431
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,983
Now go and greet them.

432
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:07,795
The east gate?

433
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,865
No. You will see him
in the main hall.

434
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,275
The lord has returned!

435
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:33,847
Sweepers!

436
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:43,156
Hurry!

437
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,628
Hurry!

438
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,640
Idiot!

439
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,327
Kneel!

440
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,629
Kneel!

441
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:17,486
First enter Bishamon Hall.

442
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,357
Next, Fudo Hall,

443
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,289
then pray in Izuna Hall,

444
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:29,065
and finally to the main hall
for the welcome home.

445
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:31,771
Understand?

446
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:36,707
In all things, comport yourself
as I have taught you these past days.

447
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:25,716
Congratulations
on your victory, my lord.

448
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,504
No! He is not my grandfather.

449
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:46,005
What are you saying?

450
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:52,546
He's fought many months.
His countenance may have changed.

451
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:57,090
Besides, he was wounded in battle.

452
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,489
A serious injury can change us.

453
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,524
Get closer to him.

454
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,633
Have a good look at him.

455
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:38,094
It's true. He has changed.

456
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,337
He's not scary anymore.

457
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,508
That's good!

458
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,182
That was close.

459
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:36,218
Thinking he was a mere child
made me careless.

460
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,018
You can't fool a child.

461
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:45,694
But you dealt with him properly.
Well done.

462
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:50,033
I didn't know what else to do.

463
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,837
That's all right.

464
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:56,569
The late lord was straightforward.

465
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:01,538
He stepped straight
into others' hearts.

466
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:07,521
Remember that.
Behave as your heart tells you.

467
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,815
That is best.

468
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,962
This is the hidden guard compartment.

469
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:33,413
When the lord gives an audience,
guards are in attendance here.

470
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:39,476
Guards are here all night as well.

471
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:53,228
This is the sutra room.

472
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:57,600
The lord reads the sutras here.

473
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:37,443
And this is the sitting room
or leisure room.

474
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:40,747
The lord relaxes here.

475
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:44,645
Beyond this is his bedchamber.

476
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,590
Now then,

477
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,771
these three attendants and two pages

478
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:13,507
know everything.

479
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:18,178
One of them
will always be at your side.

480
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:23,615
Behave as they bid you.

481
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,011
You will not be suspected.

482
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:49,977
Listen.

483
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,809
These men know who you truly are.

484
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:55,506
They're like your family.

485
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:57,447
Be frank with them.

486
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:01,055
I've chosen clever fellows for you.

487
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,539
I know from experience,

488
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:23,242
having played
the lord's double for so long...

489
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:26,906
that it's a difficult task.

490
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:34,615
It's not easy to suppress
your identity and become another.

491
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,621
That's right.

492
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:46,732
I often wanted to be myself,
to be free.

493
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:55,002
But now I think
it was selfish of me.

494
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:01,707
The shadow of a man
can never stand up

495
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,444
and walk on its own.

496
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,854
I was my brother's shadow.

497
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:15,462
Now that I have lost him...

498
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,032
I don't know what to do.

499
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:09,915
Well,

500
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:14,485
you will meet
the lord's mistresses tonight.

501
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:19,190
These men will teach you manners.

502
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:24,165
Study the floor plan of this mansion
and keep it in your head.

503
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:28,201
Don't get lost in your own house.

504
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:17,041
My name is Tsuchiya,
chief attendant.

505
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,391
Amemiya. The same.

506
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,199
Hara. The same.

507
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,933
Amari. Page.

508
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:45,745
Tomono. The same.

509
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:47,781
Very well.

510
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,917
Don't be overconfident.

511
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,853
What kind of behavior is that?

512
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,524
The late lord never acted so vulgar.

513
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,765
How is this?

514
01:21:56,144 --> 01:22:00,945
Little Takemaru was a problem,
but the horse is worse.

515
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:06,253
It can tell.
Only the late lord could ride it.

516
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:07,683
Indeed.

517
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:12,753
If the double falls off,
everyone will suspect.

518
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:22,529
Lord Shingen has been ill.
He must refrain from riding.

519
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:23,898
Good idea.

520
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,168
There are many other problems.

521
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:33,743
We must be very careful if we are
to carry out the late lord's wishes.

522
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:35,109
A case in point.

523
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:39,713
Tonight he will have to meet
the late lord's mistresses.

524
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:42,652
That will present another problem.

525
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:45,656
Our master suffered a serious injury.

526
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:49,619
He must refrain from mounting
his mistresses, too.

527
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:11,846
Where is Lord Katsuyori?

528
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,351
With Takemaru.

529
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:16,615
He is another problem.

530
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:18,452
Perhaps the biggest of all.

531
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:24,496
He has never once smiled
since his son Takemaru was chosen as heir.

532
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,323
No wonder.

533
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,795
He has won many battles.

534
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:33,441
Now he is a mere guardian.
He cannot be happy.

535
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:37,806
And besides that,
he has to call that double Father.

536
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:40,209
It's no different for any of us.

537
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:44,949
This is no time for personal concerns.

538
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:49,153
We must be united.

539
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:55,422
That is all.

540
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,897
I will return to Suwa Castle.

541
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:22,280
He is late.

542
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:27,009
But we cannot go any further.
I'm worried.

543
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:29,349
Nobukado is with him.

544
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:35,153
Besides, even I cannot tell
which is which.

545
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,757
He will not be discovered.

546
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:43,535
What about in bed?

547
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:26,274
Do I look like a different man?

548
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:31,251
You have not changed in appearance,

549
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:35,450
but your voice has changed

550
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,388
because of your illness.

551
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,451
The way you speak, too.

552
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:45,630
A serious illness can change
even a man's heart.

553
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:58,939
On second thought,
you do look like a different man.

554
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:30,741
Very well.

555
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:32,871
The game is over.

556
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:36,414
Actually...

557
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,143
Actually,

558
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:43,381
I am not Lord Shingen.

559
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:47,220
I impersonate the lord.

560
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:50,159
You're joking.

561
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,466
No, it's true.

562
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:57,294
Nobukado grew tired of the role

563
01:27:57,472 --> 01:28:00,168
and hired me.

564
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:02,901
Ask him.

565
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,209
You're so funny.

566
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:10,874
Isn't that true, Nobukado?

567
01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:15,281
How about you over there?

568
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:20,060
Look closely.
I am not your master.

569
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:55,453
Sire.

570
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,760
You are drunk.

571
01:28:57,932 --> 01:29:00,400
It is late.
It's time for you to retire.

572
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,106
The master will not stay

573
01:29:08,209 --> 01:29:10,040
with either of you.

574
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:16,282
The doctor said
he must not exert himself.

575
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:04,091
The spies agree that
Shingen has returned home,

576
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:08,895
and everything there is as usual.

577
01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:10,998
I don't understand.

578
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:14,737
It was his chance to take Kyoto.

579
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:20,180
Nobunaga, his rival,
is busy fighting other warlords.

580
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:26,085
Shingen would not miss
such an opportunity.

581
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:39,329
Very well. Let's attack.

582
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,731
Attack whom?

583
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:47,099
The Takeda outpost in Suruga.

584
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:51,902
Attack Suruga
and see how they react.

585
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:55,776
Their reaction will tell us

586
01:30:56,751 --> 01:31:00,380
whether Shingen is dead or alive.

587
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:44,027
You are now the leader
of the Takeda clan.

588
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:47,131
No one may deny this.

589
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:49,194
The late lord...

590
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:55,973
attacked and destroyed Lord Suwa,
who owned this castle.

591
01:31:56,210 --> 01:32:00,613
He loved Suwa's daughter,
and you are the result.

592
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:05,080
You are Suwa's grandson.

593
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:08,450
He could not appoint you heir.

594
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:14,493
So he compromised and
made your son Takemaru his heir.

595
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:21,165
In his heart, I'm sure he always
thought the position was yours.

596
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:22,632
You're wrong!

597
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:25,197
I was not a son to him.

598
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,236
I was just another one of his men.

599
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:31,205
He never once treated me like a son.

600
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,945
You're mistaken.

601
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:47,584
He wished to be buried in Lake Suwa

602
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:50,196
in his armor.

603
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:52,298
Do you know why?

604
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:56,136
Since you live here in Suwa Castle,

605
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:00,333
he wanted to be near you,
to aid you.

606
01:33:01,642 --> 01:33:04,873
I believe this shows his feelings.

607
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:08,140
Then why did he forbid me
to use his banner

608
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:12,749
with the four symbols for
Wind, Forest, Fire and Mountain?

609
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:17,687
It represents the head
of the Takeda clan.

610
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:24,129
That banner represents
your late father.

611
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:27,897
He forbade you to use it

612
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:31,635
because he wanted you
to surpass him,

613
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:35,435
to fly your own banner.

614
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:44,615
What really infuriates me
is the way his chief retainers

615
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:49,814
make his last wishes their excuse
to treat me with disrespect.

616
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:51,583
Consider that!

617
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,155
Even if this was his plan,

618
01:33:56,230 --> 01:34:01,133
how could I call a thief my father
and bow down to him?

619
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:10,008
But now your name
as a brave warrior is well known.

620
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,307
The day will come

621
01:34:13,514 --> 01:34:18,315
when the retainers
will kneel to you.

622
01:34:34,902 --> 01:34:37,268
Why are you called a mountain,
Grandfather?

623
01:34:38,272 --> 01:34:39,330
Mountain?

624
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:44,171
Everybody calls you that.
Where is the mountain?

625
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:50,847
Is it because we have
this mountain in our garden?

626
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:03,492
You know the master's banner.

627
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:06,929
What is written there?

628
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,967
"Swift as the wind.

629
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:13,972
Quiet as a forest.

630
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:20,176
Fierce as fire.

631
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:23,706
Immovable as a mountain."

632
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,375
The lord is that mountain.

633
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:31,887
Both in battle and at home,

634
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:36,018
he is steadfast, like a mountain.

635
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:39,090
When his army advances,

636
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:44,067
first the horsemen attack,
swift as the wind.

637
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:48,068
Second, the lancers
raise a forest of spears,

638
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:51,175
advancing with silent resolve.

639
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:54,837
Third, more horsemen
engulf the enemy ranks

640
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:57,142
as mercilessly as fire.

641
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:03,718
And the lord is always behind them,
watching over them,

642
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,859
immovable as a mountain.

643
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:10,896
That is why our army,
from general to foot soldier,

644
01:36:11,132 --> 01:36:14,932
can fight so resolutely.

645
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,204
Immovable as a mountain.

646
01:36:18,906 --> 01:36:21,272
The lord is that mountain.

647
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:25,742
So we call him the mountain.

648
01:36:25,913 --> 01:36:27,380
I see.

649
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,813
Understand, Takemaru?

650
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:38,386
Messenger from Lord Katsuyori!

651
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:12,656
What are you doing?

652
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,057
Lord Nobukado is coming.

653
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:18,363
You must be more careful.
They could see you.

654
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:49,826
Listen.

655
01:37:50,097 --> 01:37:53,863
Tonight, as soon as
Lord Katsuyori arrives,

656
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:57,299
we will have a conference
with the entire clan.

657
01:37:59,473 --> 01:38:04,001
You will have only to sit
with dignity and listen.

658
01:38:04,812 --> 01:38:08,771
The generals will make the decisions.

659
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:12,447
Then I will say,

660
01:38:13,254 --> 01:38:16,246
"The discussion is over.

661
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:19,324
Let us have your instructions."

662
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,927
Then you will nod

663
01:38:22,162 --> 01:38:27,190
in satisfaction and say,
"Well done. Thank you all."

664
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:30,269
Then you will stand up and leave.

665
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:32,663
Understand?

666
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,000
Well done. Thank you all.

667
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:37,975
Then I stand up and leave.

668
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:47,349
Do not try to put on airs.

669
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:52,189
The late lord was like a mountain.

670
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:55,555
Act naturally.

671
01:38:57,998 --> 01:38:59,556
And relaxed.

672
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:14,501
The discussion is concluded.

673
01:40:15,275 --> 01:40:19,541
Let us make our decision.

674
01:40:19,813 --> 01:40:22,077
leyasu is unforgivable.

675
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:25,909
We beat him once at Mikata.

676
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:30,956
He did not learn,
and now he is attacking us.

677
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:37,119
I will drive them all
from our domain.

678
01:40:41,535 --> 01:40:46,598
Only one outer castle has fallen.
You need not go yourself.

679
01:40:47,174 --> 01:40:50,166
We must study leyasu's moves

680
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:54,143
to understand his purposes.

681
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:04,622
According to the latest word,

682
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:08,421
the Tokugawa army
has not only burned Okabe Castle,

683
01:41:08,662 --> 01:41:13,622
they have surrounded Futamata Castle
and fortified their position.

684
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:19,771
We must counterattack now
to save Futamata.

685
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:27,906
That castle is protected by Anayama.

686
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:30,812
It will not fall easily.

687
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:36,456
If he believes the castle is in danger,
he will ask the lord for help.

688
01:41:45,999 --> 01:41:49,901
leyasu does not move capriciously.

689
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:55,241
He studies our reactions
to his initial attack.

690
01:41:56,643 --> 01:42:02,047
He is young,
but very thoughtful and cunning.

691
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:14,216
That's why Nobunaga
acts as his right hand.

692
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:19,924
He frightens me!

693
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:29,465
Our first question

694
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:34,611
is whether leyasu is serious
or only testing.

695
01:42:34,915 --> 01:42:36,576
We must first determine that.

696
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,012
But...

697
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:43,822
it will be too late if we wait
until we know he's serious.

698
01:42:46,093 --> 01:42:47,788
Attack now...

699
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:52,826
or wait and see.

700
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:59,597
What does our lord think?

701
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:05,772
Father, what are your instructions?

702
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,873
Do not move.

703
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:44,477
A mountain does not move.

704
01:43:51,491 --> 01:43:53,186
Well done.

705
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,796
Thank you all.

706
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,799
Lord Katsuyori!

707
01:45:10,504 --> 01:45:12,131
There's no other way to put it.

708
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:16,476
Lord Katsuyori behaved badly.

709
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:22,914
He knew it was
the late lord's double.

710
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:32,521
But that man countered beautifully.

711
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:40,158
But we cannot approve.

712
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:44,968
He shamed Katsuyori publicly.

713
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:47,402
He went too far.

714
01:45:47,574 --> 01:45:52,443
I admire his quick wits,
smoothing things over like that.

715
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:58,017
But quick-witted men
can easily get carried away.

716
01:45:58,885 --> 01:46:01,911
He must stay
within the limits of his role.

717
01:46:02,122 --> 01:46:05,319
You must keep a tight rein on him,
Lord Nobukado.

718
01:46:08,228 --> 01:46:09,593
I understand.

719
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:13,089
But think about it.

720
01:46:15,335 --> 01:46:19,772
No matter how resourceful he may be,

721
01:46:21,274 --> 01:46:23,834
it's a difficult assignment.

722
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:31,378
He must feel
as if he were up on the cross.

723
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:35,946
Yet he handles it so well.

724
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:39,789
And all because...

725
01:46:46,366 --> 01:46:50,826
one brief meeting
with the late lord won his heart...

726
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:56,842
and he was saddened by his death.

727
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:05,179
You have to feel sorry for him.

728
01:50:45,805 --> 01:50:46,703
What is it?

729
01:50:51,044 --> 01:50:52,477
A dream.

730
01:50:56,783 --> 01:50:59,911
A million enemies surrounded me.

731
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:28,440
Musket Company 3, forward march!

732
01:52:26,673 --> 01:52:28,664
Tell leyasu this:

733
01:52:29,509 --> 01:52:33,275
While I fight Lord Asai,

734
01:52:33,613 --> 01:52:37,105
he should ride out himself
to challenge Shingen.

735
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:41,817
Sending a token force won't tell us
whether Shingen is dead or alive.

736
01:53:09,883 --> 01:53:12,147
I didn't know the priests
were still here.

737
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:14,977
They return to Sakai today.

738
01:53:15,288 --> 01:53:16,585
Wait.

739
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:21,091
One of them was a man of medicine.

740
01:53:21,494 --> 01:53:24,486
Send him to pay Shingen
a sympathy visit.

741
01:53:24,664 --> 01:53:27,565
A visit from an enemy camp
might be difficult.

742
01:53:27,734 --> 01:53:30,328
Idiot. You think I don't know that?

743
01:53:30,503 --> 01:53:32,095
Use Nobutora.

744
01:53:32,872 --> 01:53:37,434
The geezer's at loose ends in Kyoto
since his own son Shingen banished him.

745
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:39,874
They can't turn away
a messenger from him.

746
01:53:40,046 --> 01:53:43,914
He has servants
who know Shingen well.

747
01:53:44,083 --> 01:53:47,610
With one of them along,
we can learn the truth.

748
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:50,916
Settle down!

749
01:54:18,651 --> 01:54:20,915
Amari and Okudaira have turned coat!

750
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:24,351
Noda Castle and Nagashino Castle
have fallen to leyasu!

751
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:40,229
Here goes, Takemaru.

752
01:54:46,412 --> 01:54:48,573
You're good, Grandfather.

753
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:01,817
Another war?

754
01:55:01,995 --> 01:55:03,986
Are you scared?

755
01:55:04,163 --> 01:55:08,793
No. But you'll be gone.
I'll miss you.

756
01:55:12,772 --> 01:55:16,731
Noda and Nagashino have fallen.
Where is leyasu?

757
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:21,704
He and his men have surrounded
Futamata Castle.

758
01:55:30,023 --> 01:55:31,354
Katsuyori's gone to battle!

759
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:37,722
What?

760
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:41,025
On his own, without consulting us?

761
01:55:41,234 --> 01:55:42,201
Where did he go?

762
01:55:42,368 --> 01:55:43,699
Takatenjin.

763
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:46,898
Takatenjin Castle?

764
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:54,941
Not a bad strategy.

765
01:55:55,815 --> 01:55:59,717
If he takes the castle,
leyasu will be threatened.

766
01:55:59,886 --> 01:56:01,012
Only if he takes it.

767
01:56:01,187 --> 01:56:04,520
Even his father failed to take it.

768
01:56:04,757 --> 01:56:06,850
I don't think he can.

769
01:56:07,026 --> 01:56:11,326
leyasu has a chance
to attack him from the rear.

770
01:56:12,131 --> 01:56:13,462
You may go.

771
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:26,240
We have no choice.

772
01:56:28,014 --> 01:56:30,175
We must send our troops

773
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:34,548
to show his father is behind him.

774
01:56:35,688 --> 01:56:36,950
That's right.

775
01:56:37,757 --> 01:56:41,386
When leyasu sees Shingen's banners,
he'll stay away.

776
01:56:46,499 --> 01:56:47,830
<i>Sire! </i>

777
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:51,197
A messenger has arrived
from Master Nobutora.

778
01:56:53,306 --> 01:56:55,069
From Father?

779
01:56:57,677 --> 01:56:58,837
What is the message?

780
01:56:59,412 --> 01:57:03,849
Your father has sent a foreign physician
to pay our lord a sympathy visit.

781
01:57:26,839 --> 01:57:28,807
This way, please.

782
01:57:46,626 --> 01:57:49,288
He says Father sent him...

783
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:52,865
but I'm suspicious.

784
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:58,935
Someone else is behind this.

785
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:06,274
They sent a doctor to see
what they could find out about our lord.

786
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:11,743
But if we send them away,
it will raise suspicions.

787
01:58:15,588 --> 01:58:17,215
Very well.

788
01:58:18,157 --> 01:58:20,921
We'll let them see the double.

789
01:58:21,928 --> 01:58:27,025
Maybe this will dispel enemy doubts
about whether Shingen is still with us.

790
01:58:28,201 --> 01:58:29,463
All right.

791
01:58:30,002 --> 01:58:33,130
We'll leave that to you.

792
01:58:33,973 --> 01:58:36,271
The rest of us
must prepare to march!

793
01:58:57,029 --> 01:58:59,054
Fall in!

794
01:59:03,035 --> 01:59:04,559
I'll take you to him.

795
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:10,575
I'll take your sword.

796
01:59:30,363 --> 01:59:31,830
Groom!

797
01:59:32,498 --> 01:59:34,659
His horse isn't needed!

798
01:59:49,448 --> 01:59:51,279
Please wait here.

799
02:00:21,948 --> 02:00:26,351
Well, well, Taguchi.
Long time no see.

800
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:29,586
Is my father well?
- Yes, sir.

801
02:00:33,025 --> 02:00:37,052
It was good of you to come.

802
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:41,725
Since Lord Shingen
fell ill with a high fever

803
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:44,335
after the battle of Mikata,

804
02:00:44,503 --> 02:00:46,733
it seemed prudent to pull back.

805
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:49,204
But he's now fully recovered.

806
02:01:00,019 --> 02:01:01,247
Taguchi.

807
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,513
I'm pleased to find you well.

808
02:01:07,093 --> 02:01:10,392
This boy is my heir, Takemaru.

809
02:01:10,763 --> 02:01:14,255
I'm pleased
to make your acquaintance.

810
02:01:14,433 --> 02:01:15,457
Thank you.

811
02:01:18,838 --> 02:01:23,332
The lord has no ailments now,
but since you are here...

812
02:01:24,410 --> 02:01:25,900
approach.

813
02:01:34,186 --> 02:01:38,714
I understand my lord
was wounded at Kawanakajima

814
02:01:39,091 --> 02:01:42,117
by Kenshin's sword.

815
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:44,695
Has the wound healed well?

816
02:01:48,134 --> 02:01:51,695
Indeed. All that remains
of that wound is the tale to tell.

817
02:01:51,871 --> 02:01:52,838
It's nothing.

818
02:01:53,839 --> 02:01:55,466
May I take your pulse?

819
02:02:15,161 --> 02:02:16,958
It's such a shame.

820
02:02:17,129 --> 02:02:21,293
I'd like to sit a while
and hear all about Father.

821
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:25,603
But as you can see,
we're preparing to march.

822
02:02:25,771 --> 02:02:27,432
Indeed, my lord.

823
02:02:30,376 --> 02:02:34,176
MAY, 1574

824
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:35,260
The lord's banners in the rear!

825
02:06:10,930 --> 02:06:13,831
MOUNTAIN

826
02:07:26,572 --> 02:07:27,834
Do not move.

827
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:31,571
No matter what happens,
stay calm and do not move.

828
02:07:31,977 --> 02:07:33,274
Understand?

829
02:08:03,575 --> 02:08:04,974
Not again!

830
02:08:05,277 --> 02:08:08,838
He stands behind me at every battle!

831
02:08:11,250 --> 02:08:13,980
He treats me like a child!

832
02:08:14,319 --> 02:08:16,082
Let him.

833
02:08:16,588 --> 02:08:20,547
We will take over this castle
with our own hands

834
02:08:20,893 --> 02:08:23,657
and show the chief retainers
who's who.

835
02:08:27,299 --> 02:08:29,460
Tell the men on the line

836
02:08:29,902 --> 02:08:32,393
to break into the castle tonight!

837
02:08:32,571 --> 02:08:34,163
No, burn it!

838
02:09:14,213 --> 02:09:18,240
<i>Wind Company, present! </i>

839
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:20,112
<i>Forest Company</i>

840
02:09:20,219 --> 02:09:23,154
<i>and Fire Company, present! </i>

841
02:09:53,185 --> 02:09:57,383
Fire Company, on guard!

842
02:09:57,723 --> 02:10:01,352
Forest Company, on guard!

843
02:10:01,527 --> 02:10:05,395
Wind Company, forward!

844
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:19,269
What's that sound?

845
02:11:19,938 --> 02:11:23,339
A group of horsemen
are coming this way.

846
02:11:23,609 --> 02:11:26,009
Why would our flank guard move?

847
02:11:26,178 --> 02:11:27,167
Whose flags are they?

848
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:30,277
There are none.

849
02:11:36,188 --> 02:11:39,316
Were those shots ours or theirs?

850
02:11:39,491 --> 02:11:41,288
I cannot tell.

851
02:11:41,627 --> 02:11:42,958
Now I see!

852
02:11:43,896 --> 02:11:45,989
Enemy musketmen!

853
02:11:49,902 --> 02:11:51,927
Horses, back!

854
02:11:52,104 --> 02:11:54,470
Make walls of those lances.

855
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:02,071
Battle formation!

856
02:12:11,857 --> 02:12:13,791
Forest, on guard, forward!

857
02:12:13,959 --> 02:12:16,723
Wind, on guard, flanks!

858
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:37,642
Fire, on guard, rear left!

859
02:13:18,423 --> 02:13:22,689
Fire, open to right!

860
02:13:24,262 --> 02:13:27,891
Flank guard, right!

861
02:13:31,403 --> 02:13:34,964
Company 3, on guard, rear!

862
02:13:40,345 --> 02:13:43,542
Company 1, right!

863
02:14:04,736 --> 02:14:08,695
Fire, Company 3, right!

864
02:14:43,241 --> 02:14:47,439
Wind, open to left!

865
02:14:55,053 --> 02:14:57,283
The enemy! A raid!

866
02:15:17,843 --> 02:15:19,037
Keep calm.

867
02:15:34,793 --> 02:15:36,658
Let them go!

868
02:15:36,828 --> 02:15:38,887
Come back!

869
02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:57,242
Enemy on the left hillside!

870
02:15:57,582 --> 02:16:00,483
Enemy on the left. Attack!

871
02:16:25,610 --> 02:16:28,306
Enemy's retreated!

872
02:16:38,657 --> 02:16:42,093
Return to original battle formation!

873
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:49,456
Look.

874
02:17:50,428 --> 02:17:54,421
They died protecting you.

875
02:18:16,454 --> 02:18:20,948
Imagine you are already crucified.
Do not move.

876
02:18:53,625 --> 02:18:55,422
What's that?

877
02:18:56,061 --> 02:18:58,052
Enemy on the right.

878
02:18:58,463 --> 02:19:03,196
The banner bears the mark of Hon.

879
02:19:05,236 --> 02:19:10,299
It's Heihachi Honda,
one of Tokugawa's bravest generals!

880
02:19:32,797 --> 02:19:34,355
Halt!

881
02:19:44,709 --> 02:19:45,767
Far enough!

882
02:19:45,944 --> 02:19:47,639
Pull back!

883
02:19:58,923 --> 02:20:00,481
Do not move!

884
02:21:03,688 --> 02:21:06,179
Companies to left!

885
02:21:09,027 --> 02:21:12,053
Companies to left!

886
02:21:22,307 --> 02:21:23,774
Good work.

887
02:21:28,913 --> 02:21:31,404
According to their report,

888
02:21:31,583 --> 02:21:34,984
far from being dead,
Shingen is in the best of health.

889
02:21:35,153 --> 02:21:38,281
So it would seem.

890
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:43,389
- Bring me wine.
- Right away, sire.

891
02:21:51,002 --> 02:21:54,768
For some reason,
I cannot help feeling

892
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:57,604
that Shingen is dead.

893
02:21:57,775 --> 02:22:00,437
I have the same feeling.

894
02:22:00,712 --> 02:22:01,610
Why?

895
02:22:02,146 --> 02:22:03,477
I do not know.

896
02:22:03,648 --> 02:22:07,243
Something tells me so.

897
02:22:16,661 --> 02:22:22,463
We both want Shingen dead.
It would help us greatly.

898
02:22:29,274 --> 02:22:32,641
So we anticipate his death.

899
02:22:33,711 --> 02:22:35,303
We want to believe he's dead.

900
02:22:43,688 --> 02:22:45,747
Maybe that is all.

901
02:23:06,444 --> 02:23:10,312
The color is like blood,
but this is European sake.

902
02:23:39,877 --> 02:23:41,344
What's the matter?

903
02:23:41,512 --> 02:23:43,036
Do you not like it?

904
02:23:52,824 --> 02:23:53,916
Well, then.

905
02:24:21,619 --> 02:24:25,521
I need to go put down
that religious uprising in Ise.

906
02:24:26,391 --> 02:24:27,949
I have much to do.

907
02:24:30,528 --> 02:24:32,689
Raise the curtain!

908
02:24:33,631 --> 02:24:35,462
On your feet!

909
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:09,199
I arrived too late to help you.

910
02:25:10,168 --> 02:25:13,103
This gold expresses my regrets.

911
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:18,170
I will leave Takeda to you.

912
02:25:20,044 --> 02:25:21,204
Farewell.

913
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:38,624
Nobody can deny that
you took Takatenjin Castle.

914
02:25:38,963 --> 02:25:42,160
Even your father failed to take it.

915
02:25:42,333 --> 02:25:43,766
You're wrong!

916
02:25:45,937 --> 02:25:48,929
It is true I took the castle.

917
02:25:49,707 --> 02:25:54,007
But the credit does not go to me.

918
02:25:57,315 --> 02:25:59,613
It goes to the phantom
of my late father

919
02:26:00,618 --> 02:26:02,586
that frightened the enemy away.

920
02:26:04,255 --> 02:26:07,554
Try as I might,

921
02:26:08,526 --> 02:26:10,687
I cannot escape my father's shadow.

922
02:26:12,096 --> 02:26:17,227
The chief retainers are to blame.

923
02:26:18,503 --> 02:26:24,373
They use the lord's double
to make you look small.

924
02:27:09,487 --> 02:27:10,852
Where's the mountain?

925
02:27:11,956 --> 02:27:13,947
In the garden, with Takemaru.

926
02:27:14,125 --> 02:27:15,786
This will not do.

927
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:20,420
I told you
one of you must always be with him.

928
02:27:20,665 --> 02:27:21,996
I am sorry.

929
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:27,198
He's now accustomed
to living in this house.

930
02:27:27,371 --> 02:27:31,501
He has become sure of himself
since Takatenjin.

931
02:27:36,247 --> 02:27:38,010
He's doing well.

932
02:27:39,317 --> 02:27:42,912
It's as if our late lord
had possessed him.

933
02:27:44,288 --> 02:27:47,883
And he's charmed Takemaru, too.

934
02:27:49,460 --> 02:27:51,951
The child loves him.

935
02:27:52,496 --> 02:27:56,489
It makes me sad to see it.

936
02:27:58,302 --> 02:27:59,735
That is so.

937
02:28:01,672 --> 02:28:03,970
It's a cruel thing to do.

938
02:28:05,776 --> 02:28:08,540
Someday Takemaru
will learn the truth.

939
02:28:09,814 --> 02:28:12,078
It will not be long.

940
02:28:13,584 --> 02:28:17,247
The three years
the lord wished us to hide his death

941
02:28:17,421 --> 02:28:20,413
are already more than half gone.

942
02:28:28,766 --> 02:28:30,358
When the day comes,

943
02:28:33,004 --> 02:28:36,371
Takemaru will not be
the only one to be pitied.

944
02:28:37,775 --> 02:28:40,835
What will happen to the double?

945
02:28:43,915 --> 02:28:49,046
A shadow cannot exist
without the person.

946
02:28:50,955 --> 02:28:53,651
When it's finally known
that the person is gone,

947
02:28:54,258 --> 02:28:59,423
what will happen to the shadow?

948
02:29:19,483 --> 02:29:20,973
Where is your grandfather?

949
02:29:21,986 --> 02:29:23,578
He's amazing!

950
02:29:23,754 --> 02:29:26,689
Only he can ride that horse.

951
02:29:44,275 --> 02:29:46,641
Lord Shingen!

952
02:30:06,263 --> 02:30:09,664
Lord Nobukado, he has no scar!

953
02:30:09,967 --> 02:30:12,561
The wound he got at Kawanakajima.

954
02:30:14,538 --> 02:30:17,530
So he is an impersonator after all.

955
02:30:18,743 --> 02:30:20,301
Grandfather!

956
02:30:22,046 --> 02:30:25,675
This man is not your grandfather.

957
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:28,250
He's an impersonator.

958
02:30:28,819 --> 02:30:30,548
Grandfather!

959
02:30:34,125 --> 02:30:35,956
Grandfather!

960
02:30:52,109 --> 02:30:53,872
How foolish.

961
02:30:56,447 --> 02:30:59,245
He could deceive men,

962
02:30:59,850 --> 02:31:01,943
but not the horse!

963
02:31:02,953 --> 02:31:04,113
No.

964
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:12,228
I am to blame.

965
02:31:12,563 --> 02:31:13,894
Not at all.

966
02:31:17,134 --> 02:31:21,696
It's a miracle
the secret has lasted this long.

967
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:26,100
We owe it all to you.

968
02:31:32,483 --> 02:31:35,782
Lord Katsuyori has arrived.

969
02:31:50,101 --> 02:31:51,591
The play is over.

970
02:31:52,336 --> 02:31:55,100
Lord Katsuyori is our master now.

971
02:32:41,452 --> 02:32:43,147
From Nobukado.

972
02:32:45,456 --> 02:32:47,651
He appreciates all you've done.

973
02:32:52,329 --> 02:32:57,494
And this is with the compliments
of the other generals.

974
02:33:00,738 --> 02:33:02,000
Take it.

975
02:33:14,251 --> 02:33:15,411
Well, then...

976
02:33:17,221 --> 02:33:18,916
keep well.

977
02:33:49,053 --> 02:33:51,715
Go away! Get out of here!

978
02:33:59,930 --> 02:34:03,764
I want to see Takemaru
and say good-bye.

979
02:34:03,934 --> 02:34:06,095
Takemaru?
What impudence!

980
02:34:06,270 --> 02:34:07,635
How dare you!

981
02:34:07,871 --> 02:34:09,429
Go!

982
02:34:53,217 --> 02:34:57,051
APRIL 1575

983
02:35:48,972 --> 02:35:50,496
Quiet!

984
02:36:28,345 --> 02:36:29,710
What's that?

985
02:36:30,914 --> 02:36:33,576
They conducted Shingen's funeral?

986
02:37:02,279 --> 02:37:04,474
That's just like Shingen.

987
02:37:07,084 --> 02:37:11,612
For three years after his death,

988
02:37:13,323 --> 02:37:16,349
he successfully deceived me.

989
02:37:34,611 --> 02:37:40,481
<i>Even the 50 years of a man's life</i>

990
02:37:41,285 --> 02:37:48,123
<i>Are short compared</i>
<i>to that of this world</i>

991
02:37:49,993 --> 02:37:54,453
<i>Life is but a dream</i>

992
02:37:56,967 --> 02:38:00,664
<i>A vision</i>

993
02:38:01,071 --> 02:38:05,474
<i>An illusion</i>

994
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:14,440
<i>Life, once given</i>

995
02:38:16,687 --> 02:38:23,354
<i>Cannot last forever</i>

996
02:38:35,105 --> 02:38:42,273
<i>Life, once given</i>

997
02:38:44,348 --> 02:38:50,218
<i>Cannot last forever</i>

998
02:39:16,246 --> 02:39:20,342
Katsuyori has left his domain
with 25,000 soldiers,

999
02:39:20,517 --> 02:39:22,485
heading for Nagashino.

1000
02:39:22,653 --> 02:39:25,087
What? The mountain has moved!

1001
02:40:00,457 --> 02:40:02,015
My lord,

1002
02:40:02,192 --> 02:40:05,252
what do you think that light is
that's barring your path?

1003
02:40:08,932 --> 02:40:09,921
A rainbow.

1004
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:11,624
You're wrong!

1005
02:40:11,802 --> 02:40:17,297
It is your late father's instructions
not to proceed.

1006
02:40:17,474 --> 02:40:23,003
He's telling you to stay
in your domain and guard it.

1007
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:26,716
Those were your father's last words.

1008
02:40:26,883 --> 02:40:30,011
If you do that, nothing can harm us.

1009
02:40:30,187 --> 02:40:33,884
Harm? An ominous word.

1010
02:40:34,791 --> 02:40:38,852
Since the time of our ancestors,

1011
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:42,098
the Takeda have never
run from a fight.

1012
02:40:50,207 --> 02:40:52,038
Forward!

1013
02:40:57,114 --> 02:40:58,376
Forward!

1014
02:41:38,955 --> 02:41:44,825
MAY 21, 1575

1015
02:41:50,867 --> 02:41:54,963
FIRE FOREST WIND

1016
02:42:21,932 --> 02:42:24,400
Wind and Fire...

1017
02:42:25,702 --> 02:42:27,636
this will be the end of our clan.

1018
02:42:28,505 --> 02:42:30,063
Farewell.

1019
02:42:30,874 --> 02:42:32,967
I will go first.

1020
02:42:34,044 --> 02:42:36,740
Wind and Forest...

1021
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:39,748
we will meet again
where Lord Shingen is.

1022
02:43:40,710 --> 02:43:42,075
Attention!

1023
02:44:27,791 --> 02:44:30,692
Takeda will be no more.

1024
02:44:31,661 --> 02:44:34,186
Once the mountain has moved,
it is finished.

1025
02:44:34,931 --> 02:44:36,364
Messenger!

1026
02:44:45,742 --> 02:44:50,111
Tell the gunners
to shoot the horses first.

1027
02:44:51,348 --> 02:44:56,285
The Takeda cavalry
cannot fight without horses.

1028
02:46:20,704 --> 02:46:23,537
WIND

1029
02:48:01,671 --> 02:48:06,301
FOREST

1030
02:49:41,404 --> 02:49:43,429
FIRE

1031
02:57:24,333 --> 02:57:27,234
SWIFT AS THE WIND
QUIET AS A FOREST

1032
02:57:27,403 --> 02:57:29,564
FIERCE AS FIRE
IMMOVABLE AS A MOUNTAIN
