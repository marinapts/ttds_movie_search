00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:22,082
It says here that a bolt of lightning...

792
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:26,319
...is going to strike the clock tower
at 10:04 p.m. Next Saturday night!

793
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:33,077
If we could somehow harness
this lightning...

794
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:37,404
...channel it into the flux capacitor...

795
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:40,080
<i>... it just might work.</i>

796
00:52:40,647 --> 00:52:44,606
Next Saturday night
we're sending you back to the future!

797
00:52:45,527 --> 00:52:47,324
All right. Saturday's good.

798
00:52:47,407 --> 00:52:51,082
I can spend a week in 1955.
I can hang out. You can show me around.

799
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:54,126

You must not leave this house.

You must not see or talk to anybody.

on future events. Do you understand?

Yeah. Sure. Okay.

today besides me?

805
00:53:10,327 --> 00:53:13,364
Yeah, well, I might've sort of
bumped into my parents.

Great Scott! Let me see that photograph
again of your brother.

get married or have kids.

813

That's why your brother's disappearing.

Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you're next.

- What did your mother see in him?
- I don't know.

831
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:32,196
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

832

He hit me with the car.

Isn't he a dreamboat?

850

- She didn't even look at him.
- This is more serious than I thought.

851
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,279
Your mother is infatuated with you
instead of your father.

852
00:55:35,327 --> 00:55:36,442
Wait a minute, Doc.

Are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me?

- Precisely.
- This is heavy.

There's that word again. <i>"</i>Heavy.<i>"</i>

Why are things so heavy in the future?
Is there a problem with the Earth's gravity?

The only way we're going to
get them to mate is if they're alone.

858

You've got to get them to interact...

...in some sort of social...

- Right!

What do kids do in the '50s?

They're your parents.
You must know them.

What if they didn't like them?
What if they told me I was no good?

880

for somebody to understand.

if I could take that kind of rejection.

You okay?

1575
01:45:46,247 --> 01:45:47,999
Is everything all right?

1576
01:45:50,607 --> 01:45:51,642
MARTY: Yeah.

1577
01:45:53,807 --> 01:45:55,399
Everything is great.

[Brakes screeching]

1580
01:46:09,207 --> 01:46:10,117
Marty!

1581
01:46:11,447 --> 01:46:13,438
You've got to come back with me!

1582
01:46:14,047 --> 01:46:16,197
- Where?
- Back to the future.

1583
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:22,559
What are you doing, Doc?

1584
01:46:23,847 --> 01:46:24,996
I need fuel.

1585
01:46:28,167 --> 01:46:30,237
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

1586
01:46:30,567 --> 01:46:34,845
No, no. I just got here. Jennifer's here.
We're taking the new truck for a spin.

1587
01:46:34,927 --> 01:46:37,680
DOC: Bring her along. This concerns her, too.

1588
01:46:37,807 --> 01:46:41,163
What are you talking about?
What happens to us in the future?

1589
01:46:41,447 --> 01:46:44,280
- Do we become assholes or something?
- No, Marty.

1590
01:46:44,367 --> 01:46:47,564
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

1591
01:46:47,647 --> 01:46:49,797
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

1592
01:46:55,927 --> 01:46:58,839
We better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

1593
01:46:58,927 --> 01:47:02,397
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
