1
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,678
I was 12 going on 13
the first time I saw a dead human being.

2
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,391
It happened in the summer of 1959...

3
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,602
...a long time ago...

4
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,980
...but only ifyou measure it
in terms ofyears.

5
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,197
I was living in a small town in Oregon
called Castle Rock.

6
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,160
There were only 1,281 people,
but to me it was the whole world.

7
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,331
It's the Bossman Bob Cormier.
It's a beautiful Friday morning in Portland.

8
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,749
It's 90 KLAM degrees and getting hotter.

9
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,295
Up the Iadder with anotherplatter.
It's Bobby Day with Rockin' Robin...

10
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,630
...it's boss.

11
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,400
How do you know a Frenchman's been
in your backyard?

12
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,944
I'm French, okay.

13
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,072
Your garbage cans are empty
and your dog's pregnant.

14
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,033
Didn't I just say I was French?

15
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,244
- I knock.
- Shit.

16
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:41,954
Twenty-nine.

17
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,330
Twenty-two.

18
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,123
Piss up a rope.

19
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,088
Gordie's out, Ol' Gordie just bit the bag
and stepped out the door.

20
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,716
Come on, man, deal.

21
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,761
Teddy Duchamp was the craziest guy
we hung around with.

22
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,930
He didn't have much of a chance in life.

23
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,182
His dad was given to fits of rage.

24
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,019
One time he held Teddy's ear to a stove
and almost burned it off.

25
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,355
I knock.

26
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,983
You four-eyed pile of shit.

27
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,652
The "pile of shit" has 1,000 eyes.

28
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:16,905
What?

29
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,616
What's so funny?
I got thirty, what have you got?

30
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,909
Sixteen.

31
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,578
Go ahead, keep Iaughing.

32
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,663
You're down to your ride, pal.

33
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,000
Chris Chambers was the Ieader of our gang
and my best friend.

34
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,920
He came from a bad family
and everyonejust knew he'd turn out bad.

35
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,714
Including Chris.

36
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,842
That's not the secret knock.

37
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,386
I forgot the secret knock. Let me in.

38
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,637
Vern.

39
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,515
Come on, you guys, open up.

40
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,728
Man, you guys are not going
to believe this. This is so boss.

41
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,231
Wait till you hear this.

42
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,859
You won't believe it. It's unbelievable.

43
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,237
Let me catch my breath. I ran all the way
from my house.

44
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,615
"I ran all the way home"

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,658
Come on. Listen to me, this is boss.

46
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,077
"Just to say I'm sorry"

47
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,414
Okay, forget it.
I don't have to tell you nothin'.

48
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,833
Hold on, you guys. Hold on.
What is it, man?

49
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,169
Great, you won't believe this, sincerely.

50
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,171
"l ran all the way home"

51
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,673
Screw you guys. Forget it.

52
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,175
What is it?

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,801
Can you camp out tonight?

54
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,305
I mean, if you tell your folks
we're gonna tent out in my backfield?

55
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,473
I think so.

56
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:28,393
Except my dad's kind of on a mean streak.
He's been drinking a lot Iately.

57
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,772
You got to. Sincerely,
you won't believe this. Can you, Gordie?

58
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,148
Yeah, probably.

59
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:36,109
So what are you pissing and moaning
about Vern-O?

60
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,528
- I knock.
- What?

61
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,155
You liar! You ain't got no pat hand.

62
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,366
You didn't deal yourself no pat hand.

63
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,535
Make your draw, shitheap.

64
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,288
You guys want to go see a dead body?

65
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,710
I was under the porch digging, you know?

66
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,297
We all understood
what Vern meant right away.

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,426
At the beginning of the school year
he had buried ajar ofpennies...

68
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,095
...underneath his house.

69
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,848
He drew a treasure map
so he could find them again.

70
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,102
A week later his mom cleaned out
his room and threw away the map.

71
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,897
Vern had been trying to find those pennies
for nine months...

72
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,482
...nine months, man.

73
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,985
You didn't know whetherlaugh or cry.

74
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,321
Jesus, Billy, we gotta do something.

75
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,365
Why? Who cares?

76
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,325
- We saw him.
- So?

77
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,704
It's nothin' to us. The kid's dead
so it's nothin' to him, neither.

78
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,790
And who gives a shit if they ever find him?
I don't.

79
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,335
It's that kid they're talking about
on the radio.

80
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,755
Brocker or Brower or Flowers,
whatever his name is.

81
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,425
The train must have hit him.

82
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,427
Big fucking deal.

83
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,805
We had all followed
the Ray Browerstory closely...

84
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,557
...since he was a kid our age.

85
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,603
Three days before, he Ieft to pick
blueberries and nobody'd seen him since.

86
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,479
I think we should tell the cops.

87
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,774
You don't go squawking to the cops
after you boosted a car.

88
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,861
They'll want to know how we got way out
on Back Harlow Road.

89
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,613
They know we don't got no car.

90
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,407
It's best we just keep quiet,
then they can't touch us.

91
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,743
But we could make an anonymous call.

92
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,498
They trace those calls stupid. I seen it
on Highway Patrol and on Dragnet.

93
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,291
Yeah, right.

94
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,252
I wish we never boosted
that goddamned Dodge.

95
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,129
I wish Ace had been with us.

96
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,715
- We could've said he was in his car.
- He wasn't!

97
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,635
- Are we gonna tell him?
- We're not going to tell nobody.

98
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,553
Nobody, never. You dig me?

99
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,555
I know the Back Harlow Road.

100
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,935
It comes to a dead end by the Royal River.
The train tracks are right there.

101
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,770
Me and my dad fished out there.

102
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:38,065
If they had known you were under there,
they would've killed you.

103
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:42,152
Could he have gotten all the way from
Chamberlain to Harlow? That's really far.

104
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:46,740
Sure. He probably started walking on the
tracks and followed them the whole way.

105
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:48,992
Yeah, right.

106
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,163
And then after dark, a train must have
come along and "el smako".

107
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,673
I bet you, if we find him,
we'll get our pictures in the paper.

108
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,508
We could even be on TV.

109
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,969
- Sure.
- We'll be heroes.

110
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,680
I don't know. Billy will know I found out.

111
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,891
He's not going to care.
'Cause it's gonna be us that find him.

112
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,644
Not Billy and Charlie Hogan,
and the boosted the car.

113
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,980
They'll probably pin a medal on you.

114
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,815
You think so?

115
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,983
Sure.

116
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,318
What'll we tell our folks?

117
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,028
Exactly what you said.

118
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,115
We'll tell our folks
that we're tenting in your backfield.

119
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,450
You tell your folks
your sleeping at Teddy's.

120
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,328
Then we say we're going
to the drag races the next day.

121
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,497
We're rock solid
until dinner tomorrow night.

122
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,624
Man that's a plan and a half.

123
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,962
But, if we find the body in South Harlow,
they'll know we didn't go to the races.

124
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,172
We'll get hided.

125
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,798
Nobody will care...

126
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,634
...because everybody will be jazzed
at our discovery...

127
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,428
...it won't make a difference.

128
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,014
My dad will hide me anyway,
but it's worth it.

129
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,183
- Shit, yeah.
- Let's do it. What do you say?

130
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,601
- All right.
- Gordie?

131
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,727
Sure.

132
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:57,936
Vern?

133
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,688
I don't know.

134
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,399
Come on, Vern-O.

135
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,531
- Okay.
- All right.

136
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,575
Too cool. Very cool.

137
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,871
I wanted to share my friends' enthusiasm,
but I couldn't.

138
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,792
Thatsummer at home,
I had become The Invisible Boy.

139
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,923
Mom, do you know where my canteen is?

140
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,177
Mom?

141
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,557
It's in Denny's room.

142
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,772
In April, my older brother, Dennis,
had been killed in ajeep accident.

143
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,565
Four months had passed...

144
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,070
...but my parents still hadn't been able
to put the pieces back together again.

145
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,110
Gordie, I got something for you.

146
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,406
This, my friend, is for you.

147
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,326
- This is your Yankee cap.
- No.

148
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,828
This is your Yankee cap.

149
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,622
It's a good luck cap.
Know how many fish we'll catch?

150
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,124
- How much?
- A bazillion.

151
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,711
A bazillion fish.
It Iooks good on you, too. Just like that.

152
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:50,340
- No. I'm going blind.
- Don't start with me. Give me a hug.

153
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,844
You found it.

154
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,389
You found it.

155
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,775
Why can't you have friends Iike Denny's?

156
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,611
Dad, they're okay.

157
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,197
Sure they are. A thief and two feebs.

158
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,282
Chris isn't a thief.

159
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,576
He stole the milk money at school.

160
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,745
He's a thief in my book.

161
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:41,892
It was almost noon as we set out to find
the body of a dead kid named Ray Brower.

162
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,937
Right here's cool.

163
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,817
- Thanks a lot.
- Sure thing.

164
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,989
- You want to see something?
- What?

165
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,908
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

166
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,535
What is it?

167
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,830
- You've got to see this.
- What is it?

168
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,459
What is it?

169
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,634
You want to be the Lone Ranger
or the Cisco Kid?

170
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,595
Walking, talking Jesus!

171
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,724
- Where'd you get this?
- Hocked it from my old man's bureau.

172
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,393
It's a .45.

173
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,769
I can see that.

174
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,276
You got shells for it?

175
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,194
I took what was left in the box.

176
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,657
My dad'll think he used them himself
shooting at beer cans while he was drunk.

177
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,744
- Is it loaded?
- Hello, no. What do you think I am?

178
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,539
Jesus!

179
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,708
Let's get out of here. Come on.

180
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,754
Gordie did it. Gordon Lachance
is shooting up Castle Rock.

181
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,839
Shut up.

182
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,259
Hey, who did that?
Who's Ietting cherry bombs off out here?

183
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,973
You should have seen your face.
Damn, that was cool!

184
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,143
- That was really fine.
- You knew it was loaded, you wet end!

185
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,604
I'm in trouble now.
That Tupper babe saw me.

186
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:12,900
- Shit, she thought it was firecrackers.
- I don't care. It was a mean trick.

187
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,778
I didn't know it was loaded.

188
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,615
- Honest.
- You swear?

189
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,950
I swear.

190
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,619
On your mother's name?

191
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,872
Even if she goes to hell for your lie?

192
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,499
I swear.

193
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,418
Pinky swear?

194
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,755
Pinky swear.

195
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,679
Girls, where you going?

196
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,266
- Come on, my brother gave me that!
- And now you're giving it to me.

197
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,601
Give it to me!

198
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,145
That's mine.

199
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,607
You're a real asshole, you know that?

200
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,029
Your brother's not very polite, Eyeball.

201
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,489
Now, Christopher.

202
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:03,534
I know you didn't mean to insult my friend.

203
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,286
I know he didn't mean to insult me.

204
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:10,457
That's why I'll give him the opportunity
to take it back.

205
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,254
- Shit.
- Take it back, kid.

206
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,549
- Stop it, you're hurting him.
- You bastard! Let go, man.

207
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,218
- Stop it! Cut it out!
- Take it back, kid.

208
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,473
You big... Okay, I take it back.

209
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,395
There.

210
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,398
Now I feel a whole Iot better about this.

211
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,900
How about you?

212
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,279
Good.

213
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,908
See you Iater girls.

214
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,130
Let's just forget them.

215
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,979
What do we need a pistol for anyway?

216
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,691
It's spooky sleeping out at night
in the woods. You might see a bear.

217
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,484
Or a garbage can.

218
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,615
I brought a comb.

219
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,366
What do we need a comb for?

220
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,994
If we get on TV
we want to look good, don't we?

221
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,163
- That's a Iot of thinking, Vern.
- Thanks.

222
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,789
Two for flinching.

223
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,631
How far do you think it's gonna be?

224
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,969
If we follow the tracks all the way
into Harlow, it should be about 20 miles.

225
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,804
Sound about right to you?

226
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,890
It might even be 30.

227
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,559
Maybe we should just hitchhike.

228
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,771
- No way, that sucks.
- Why not?

229
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,482
We could go out to Route 7
to the Shiloh church...

230
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,069
...then down the Back Harlow Road.
We'll be there by sundown.

231
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,237
That's pussy.

232
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,239
It's a long way.

233
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,325
Did your mother ever have any kids
that lived?

234
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,077
What do you mean?

235
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:40,774
We have to fill up at the junkyard.
My dad said it was a safe well.

236
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,403
- Not if Chopper's there.
- If he's there we'll send you in.

237
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,696
Very funny.

238
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,369
I'm kind of hungry. Who's got the food?

239
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,165
Did anybody bring anything?

240
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,084
Not me.

241
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,547
This is great. What are we supposed
to do? Eat our feet?

242
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,883
You mean,
you didn't bring anything, either?

243
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,428
This wasn't my idea. It was Vern's.
Why didn't you bring something?

244
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,097
I have to think of everything?
I brought the comb.

245
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,892
What do you need a comb for?
You don't have any hair.

246
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,811
I brought it for you guys,
so you'd have a comb.

247
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,439
Let's see how much money we've got?

248
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,277
I got $1.02.

249
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,656
And 68 cents from Chris.

250
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,451
60 cents from Teddy.

251
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,000
7 cents, Vern?

252
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,878
I haven't found my pennies yet.

253
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,297
$2.37 cents, not bad.

254
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,134
Quidaciolu's is at the end of the road
by the junkyard.

255
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,303
I think we can get some stuff there.

256
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:52,513
Train coming.

257
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,726
Geronimo!

258
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,856
Come on, Teddy.

259
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,235
I'm gonna dodge it.

260
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,114
Get off the tracks. You're crazy.

261
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,450
Train dodge. Dig it?

262
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:22,251
Get the hell off the tracks.
You want to get yourself killed?

263
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,586
Just Iike the beach at Normandy.

264
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:44,439
Don't tell me what to do or I'll kill you.

265
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,068
I'm trying to save your Iife.

266
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,653
You want to kill yourself?

267
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,488
Is that what you want, goddamn it?

268
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,740
You tried to kill yourself.

269
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,915
I don't need no babysitter.

270
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,709
You do, too.

271
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,008
Skin it.

272
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,052
I could have dodged it.

273
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:18,223
Listen, you can dodge it on the way back.

274
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,601
Peace.

275
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,936
Skin it.

276
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:53,217
About this time, Charlie and Billy
were playing mailbox baseball...

277
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,302
...with Ace and Eyeball.

278
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,429
Shit on that. Goddamn it!

279
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,891
Shouldn't have gone for a wooden one.

280
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:05,187
Why don't you tell me something
I don't know, asshole?

281
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:06,897
Billy, you're up.

282
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,274
You guys win.
I don't want to play no more.

283
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,817
You can't quit.

284
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,988
We only played three innings.
That'd be a non-official game.

285
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,199
Ace, me and....

286
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,538
What's with you homos?
You've been acting psycho all day.

287
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,083
What is it?

288
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,460
It's nothing, right?

289
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,672
Then if you don't mind,
I'd Iike to finish this game...

290
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:34,424
...before I start collecting
my social security, okay?

291
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,927
You're up, Billy. Move it.

292
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,221
All right, give me this fucking stick.

293
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,973
Let's play ball.

294
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,227
Foul ball.

295
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:02,744
Vern, it looks like
your mom's been out driving again.

296
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,080
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

297
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,624
Stand back, men!

298
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,170
Paratroopers, over the side!

299
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:15,716
"No Trespassing" was enforced
by Milo Pressman, thejunkman...

300
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,217
...and his dog, Chopper.

301
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:21,138
The most feared and Ieastseen dog
in Castle Rock.

302
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,933
Legend had it that
Milo had trained Chopper notjust to sic...

303
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:28,478
...but to sic specific parts
of the human anatomy.

304
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,232
Thus, a kid who had illegally scaled
thejunkyard fence...

305
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:36,236
...might hear the dread cry:
"Chopper, sic ballsl"

306
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,281
But right now neither the dread Chopper
nor Milo...

307
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,116
...was anywhere in sight.

308
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,870
Teddy's crazy.

309
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,664
Come on, men, move it out!

310
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,459
He won't Iive to be 20, I bet.

311
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,462
Remember the time you saved him
in the tree?

312
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,132
I dream about that sometimes.

313
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:02,638
Except in the dream I miss him.
I just get a few hairs and down he goes.

314
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:03,931
It's weird.

315
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,641
That is weird.

316
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,601
But you didn't miss him.

317
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,978
Chris Chambers never misses, does he?

318
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,981
Not even when
the Iadies Ieave the seat down.

319
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:14,983
Race you.

320
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,736
- No, I don't think so.
- Over to the pump.

321
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,365
- I'm kind of tired. Go.
- You're a dead man, Lachance!

322
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:24,076
It Iooks Iike Lachance
has got him this time.

323
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,661
He's got Chambers beat.

324
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,247
But what's this?
Chambers is making his move.

325
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,791
Lachance is fading
and it's Chambers at the tape.

326
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,709
The crowd goes wild.

327
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,732
You guys been watching
The Mickey Mouse Club Iately?

328
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,819
I think Annette's tits are getting bigger.

329
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,320
- You think so?
- I think so.

330
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,655
I think he's right.

331
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:06,743
I've been noticing that the A and the E
are starting to bend around the sides.

332
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,496
Annette's tits are great.

333
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,458
This is a really good time.

334
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,585
The most.

335
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:15,961
A blast.

336
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,506
Vern didn'tjust mean being offlimits
inside the junkyard...

337
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,383
...or fudging on our folks...

338
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:25,345
...or going on a hike up the tracks
to Harlow. He meant those things, but...

339
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,057
...itseems to me now it was more
and that we all knew it.

340
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:31,310
Everything was there and around us.

341
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:35,272
We knew exactly who we were
and exactly where we were going.

342
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,149
It was grand.

343
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,198
Great, spit at the fat kid. Real good.

344
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,283
What time is it?

345
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:49,077
It's a quarter after one.

346
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:52,164
You'd better go get the food.
Junkyard opens at 3:00.

347
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,749
Chopper'll be here.

348
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,292
Sic balls.

349
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,754
You go. You can pick us up
on the way back.

350
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,839
I'm not going alone. We should all go.

351
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:03,926
- I'm staying right here.
- I'm not going.

352
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,221
Girls, cool it. We'll flip for it.

353
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,639
Okay.

354
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,390
Odd man goes.

355
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,267
That's you, Gordie, odd as a cod.

356
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,061
Flip or eat lead.

357
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,360
Four tails.

358
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,695
Jesus, man, that's a goocher.

359
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,865
- That doesn't mean anything.
- No, Iet's go again.

360
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,201
That's really bad.

361
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:33,747
Remember Clint Bracken and those guys
got wiped out on Weed Hill in Durham?

362
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:37,084
He said they flipped for beers
and they came up with a goocher...

363
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,086
...just before they got in the car.

364
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,672
And, bang! They all got totalled.

365
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,424
I don't like this. Sincerely.

366
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,387
Nobody believes that crap
about moons and goochers.

367
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,431
It's baby stuff. Now come on, flip again.

368
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,770
Are you going to flip or not?

369
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,772
We don't have all day.

370
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,236
You lose, Gordie.

371
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,780
Gordie loses.

372
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,408
Old Gordie just screwed the pooch.

373
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,911
Does the word "retarded"
mean anything to you?

374
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,831
Go get the provisions, you morphadite.

375
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,500
Don't call me any
of your mother's pet names.

376
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,627
What a wet end you are, Lachance.

377
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:21,837
Shut up.

378
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,465
I don't shut up, I grow up.
And when I look at you, I throw up.

379
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:30,387
Then your mother goes around the corner
and she Iicks it up.

380
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:36,894
Finding new and disgusting ways
to degrade a friend's mother...

381
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,229
...was always held as high regard.

382
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,369
Ain't you Denny Lachance's brother?

383
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,705
Yes, sir.

384
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,083
Shame what happened to him.

385
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:04,213
The Bible says,
"In the midst of Iife we are in death".

386
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,215
Did you know that?

387
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,885
I Iost a brother in Korea.

388
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,972
You Iook Iike your brother Denny.

389
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,807
People ever tell you that?

390
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,726
Sometimes.

391
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:23,482
I remember the year
he was All-Conference.

392
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,400
Quarterback, he played.

393
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,986
Boy, could he throw.

394
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,864
Father God and Sonny Jesus.

395
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,455
Could be some scouts
at the game tomorrow.

396
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,250
- I don't know, Pop.
- Dad, could I have the potatoes?

397
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:45,045
- That's what I hear, Son.
- Are you going to see Jane after the game?

398
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,713
I think she's a Iovely girl.

399
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:50,759
- Dad, may I please have the potatoes?
- Dorothy, don't talk to the boy about girls.

400
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:55,097
He shouldn't be thinking about girls.
This is the biggest game of his Iife.

401
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:59,768
- Dennis, when you're there tomorrow...
- Did you read the story Gordie wrote?

402
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:01,144
Gordie wrote a story.

403
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,689
- It was really good.
- What did you write, sweetheart?

404
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:07,693
That's what I'm talking about.
Football takes concentration.

405
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:11,238
You start in on the girls
and his mind's all over the place.

406
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:12,906
I really liked it.

407
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,159
I thought it was great.

408
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,124
You play football?

409
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,752
Do you play football?

410
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,006
No.

411
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,049
What do you do?

412
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,803
I don't know.

413
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:38,182
Your brother, Denny,
sure could play football.

414
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,439
There you go, kid. $1.50 of hamburger.

415
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,513
You, kid! What are you doing there!
Come over here!

416
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:21,808
You, come back here, goddamn it!
I'll sic my dog on you.

417
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,393
Run!

418
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,855
Chopper, sic him! Sic him, boy!

419
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,107
Now he said: "Sic him, boy".

420
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:32,277
But what I heard was: "Chopper, sic balls".

421
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:49,711
That's Chopper?

422
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:54,174
Chopper was my firstlesson in the vast
difference between myth and reality.

423
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:57,219
Come on, Choppie. Kiss my ass, Choppie.

424
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,347
Come on, bite shit.

425
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,685
Sic balls, Choppie.

426
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:08,647
You kids stop teasing that dog!
You hear me? Stop teasing him!

427
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,733
Sonny, I'm gonna beat your ass,
teasing my dog Iike that!

428
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:14,528
Let's see you climb over this fence
and get me, fat ass!

429
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,196
Don't you call me that!

430
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,283
You Iittle tin weasel
peckerwood Ioony's son!

431
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:22,578
What did you call me?

432
00:28:22,661 --> 00:28:25,789
I know who you are,
you're Teddy Duchamp.

433
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,416
Your dad's a loony.

434
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,751
A Ioony up in the nuthouse at Togus.

435
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:33,422
He took your ear and he put it to a stove
and he burnt it off.

436
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,341
My father stormed the beach at Normandy.

437
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:40,888
He's crazier than a shithouse rat.
No wonder you're acting the way you are...

438
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:42,973
...with a loony for a father.

439
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,185
You call my dad a loony again
and I'll kill you.

440
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,061
Loony, Ioony.

441
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:51,899
I'm gonna rip your head off
and shit down your neck.

442
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,359
No, I'm gonna kill him!

443
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,695
You come on and try it, you Iittle bastard.

444
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,365
He wants you to go over so he can beat
you up then take you to the cops.

445
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:03,285
You watch your mouth.
Let him do his own fighting.

446
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:06,788
Sure, you only outweigh him
by 500 pounds, fat ass.

447
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,248
I know your name.

448
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,668
You're Lachance. I know all you guys.

449
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,838
And your fathers will get a call from me.

450
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,758
Except for the Ioony up in Togus.

451
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,762
I'm going to kill you. I'll show you.

452
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,556
- Get him away from...
- You foulmouthed whoremaster.

453
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,058
You son of a bitch!

454
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,518
You come back here.

455
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,810
Do you hear me?

456
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:31,021
Nobody ranks out my old man.

457
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,149
- My father stormed the beach...
- I said, "Come back here!"

458
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,486
- He stormed the beach, you faggot!
- Come back here.

459
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:49,081
We showed him.
Thought we were a bunch of pussies.

460
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,917
He ranked my old man.

461
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:55,796
I wondered how he could care so much
for his dad who'd almost killed him...

462
00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:00,217
...and I didn't care about my own
who hadn't touched me since I was three.

463
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,302
That was for eating bleach under the sink.

464
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,388
He ranked my old man.

465
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,600
What do you care what a fat old pile of shit
like him says about your dad?

466
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:11,562
He still stormed the beach
at Normandy, right?

467
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,148
Do you think that pile of shit
was at Normandy?

468
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:16,358
Forget it, okay?

469
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,027
He knows nothin' about your old man.
He's shit.

470
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,197
Whatever's between you and your old man,
he can't change that.

471
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:24,158
Forget it, all right?

472
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,815
I'm sorry if I'm spoiling
everybody's good time.

473
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:00,319
It's okay.

474
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:04,031
I'm not sure it should be a good time.

475
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,326
- You saying you want to go back?
- No.

476
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,789
But going to see a dead kid,
maybe it shouldn't be a party.

477
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:20,088
If he's really bad, like all cut up
with blood and shit all over him...

478
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:21,840
...I might have nightmares.

479
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:25,427
All guts and eyeballs
ready to jump and grab...

480
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,554
Shut up, goddamn it!

481
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,972
I can't help it.

482
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:31,475
Sorry.

483
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,438
It was only a quarter to three,
butit felt much later.

484
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,274
It was too hot and too much had happened.

485
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,944
We weren't even close to the Royal River.

486
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:46,865
We needed to get moving if we were
going to make some real miles before dark.

487
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:56,291
Hold still, will you?

488
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,260
So what's with you
and this Connie Palermo chick?

489
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:10,848
I've been seeing her for over a month,
and all she'll let me do is feel her tits.

490
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:14,017
She's a Catholic. They're all like that.

491
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:17,020
You want to get Iaid
you gotta get yourself a Protestant.

492
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,982
A Jew's good.

493
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,067
A KLAM newsbreak.

494
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,987
We interrupt to bring you an update
on the search for...

495
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,697
...12 year-old Ray Brower.

496
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,283
The police have expanded theirsearch
to Mutton...

497
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,201
...Durham and the outlying areas.

498
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:32,953
When are they going to give up?

499
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,122
The kid's gone. They'll never find him.

500
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:37,166
Not where they're Iooking.

501
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,710
I was right,
they ain't never gonna find him.

502
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,963
Would you hold still?
You're making me fuck up the snake part.

503
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,465
I'll tell you how they're gonna find him.

504
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:49,261
Ten years from now a hunter's going to go
into the woods to take a Ieak...

505
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,555
...wind up pissing on his bones.

506
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,974
I bet you a $1,000
they find him before that.

507
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,101
Bet you $2,000 they don't.

508
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:58,979
- Well, asshole...
- What's the big deal?

509
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,982
- Who cares?
- Would you two just shut the fuck up.

510
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,903
If either one of you assholes had $2,000,
I'd kill you both.

511
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,655
We're back here with The Bossman.

512
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,158
From the racks and stacks,
it's the best on wax.

513
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,785
It's the Cordettes, with Lollipop.

514
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,230
I got some Winstons.

515
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,398
Hocked them off my old man's dresser.

516
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,484
One apiece, for after supper.

517
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:46,860
That's cool.

518
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:51,031
That's when a cigarette tastes best,
after supper.

519
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,074
Right.

520
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,041
Do you think I'm weird?

521
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:03,126
- Definitely.
- No, seriously.

522
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,337
Am I weird?

523
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:08,841
Yes, but so what? Everybody's weird.

524
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,434
You ready for school?

525
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:21,436
Junior high.

526
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,857
You know what that means.

527
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,859
By next June we'll all be split up.

528
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,444
What are you talking about?
Why would that happen?

529
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:32,698
'Cause it's not going to be Iike
grammar school, that's why.

530
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:36,201
You'll be taking college courses,
and me, Teddy, Vern we'll all be...

531
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:39,454
...in the shop courses
making ashtrays and birdhouses.

532
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:46,211
You're gonna meet a lot of new guys.
Smart guys.

533
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,464
- Meet a lot of pussies is what you mean.
- No, man.

534
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:51,675
Don't say that. Don't even think that.

535
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:55,179
- I'm not going in with a Iot of pussies.
- Then you're an asshole.

536
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,764
What's asshole with wanting
to be with your friends?

537
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:59,975
It's asshole if your friends drag you down.

538
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:03,854
You hang with us, you'll just be
another wise guy with shit for brains.

539
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,565
You think Mighty Mouse could
beat up Superman?

540
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,942
- What are you, cracked?
- Why not?

541
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:12,321
The other day, he was carrying
five elephants in one hand.

542
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,323
You don't know nothin'.

543
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,283
Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.

544
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:20,454
Superman is a real guy.
No way a cartoon could beat up a real guy.

545
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,582
Yeah, maybe you're right.

546
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,835
Would be a good fight, though.

547
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,299
You could be a real writer someday.

548
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,843
Fuck writing! I don't to be a writer.

549
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:38,430
- It's stupid. It's a stupid waste of time.
- That's your dad talking.

550
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:40,182
- Bullshit!
- Bulltrue!

551
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,352
I know how your dad feels about you.
He doesn't care about you.

552
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:47,356
Denny was the one he cared about,
and don't try to tell me different.

553
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:54,988
You're just a kid, Gordie.

554
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:56,740
Gee thanks, Dad.

555
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:59,910
I wish to hell I was your dad.

556
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:04,915
You wouldn't be talking about taking
these stupid shop courses if I was.

557
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:10,212
It's like God gave you something, man,
all those stories that you can make up...

558
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,715
...and He said, "This is what we got
for you. Try not to lose it".

559
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,344
Kids Iose everything unless there's
someone there to look out for them.

560
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:21,056
If your parents are too fucked-up to do it,
then maybe I should.

561
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,226
Come on, you guys, let's get moving.

562
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:27,771
By the time we get there
the kid won't even be dead anymore.

563
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,195
Any of you guys know
when the next train is due?

564
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,156
We could go down to the Route 136 Bridge.

565
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,326
What? Are you crazy?
That's five miles down the river.

566
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,746
You walk five miles down the river,
you gotta walk five miles back.

567
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,289
That could take till dark.

568
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,918
We go across here, we can get
to the same place in 10 minutes.

569
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,004
But if a train comes, there's nowhere to go.

570
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:36,131
No, there isn't. You just jump.

571
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,675
- Teddy, it's a 100 feet.
- Yeah, Teddy.

572
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:42,137
You guys can go around if you want.

573
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,555
I'm crossing here.

574
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:46,099
And while you guys
are dragging your candyasses...

575
00:37:46,183 --> 00:37:50,646
...half-way across the state and back,
I'll be waiting for you on the other side...

576
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,648
...relaxing with my thoughts.

577
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:56,652
You use your left hand
or your right hand for that?

578
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,487
You wish.

579
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,722
I Iost the comb.

580
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:08,891
Forget it, Vern.

581
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,222
Train!

582
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,268
Shit!

583
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:55,896
Move it, man! Go on! Move it!

584
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,856
Get up, Vern! Damn it!

585
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,859
Get up! Move it!

586
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:02,945
Shit, Vern!

587
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:06,281
- Get up, man!
- I don't want to. We're gonna fall.

588
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:10,369
We're gonna die, damn it! Get up!

589
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,204
Go.

590
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:22,172
- You've got to go faster!
- I can't, Gordie!

591
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:28,095
Run!

592
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,477
Run, Vern, run! Move your ass!

593
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,945
Run, goddamn it, run!

594
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:12,848
At Ieast now we know
when the next train was due.

595
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,444
That was the all-time train dodge.
Too cool.

596
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:31,366
You were so scared you Iooked like
Abbott Costello when he saw the mummy.

597
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,202
I wasn't that scared.

598
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:36,371
No, really, I wasn't. Sincerely.

599
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:39,833
Then you won't mind if we check
your underpants for Hershey squirts.

600
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,376
Go screw.

601
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,420
You'd better turn yours over.

602
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,506
This is the way I like to do it.

603
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,049
Man!

604
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:49,635
You got any more, Gordie?

605
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:50,802
Sorry, Vern.

606
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:53,138
It's not funny. What am I supposed to eat?

607
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:56,308
- Why don't you cook your dick?
- It'd be a small meal.

608
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,397
Screw you guys, I got it.

609
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:19,581
Nothing like a smoke after a meal.

610
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,836
I cherish these moments.

611
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,799
What? What did I say?

612
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:36,557
Gordie, why don't you tell us a story?

613
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,891
I don't know.

614
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,227
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on, Gordie.

615
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:43,063
None of your horror stories, okay?

616
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:46,525
I don't want to hear no horror stories.
I'm not up for that.

617
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,237
Tell us one about Sergeant Steel
and his battling leathernecks.

618
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:53,574
The one I've been thinking about
is kind of different.

619
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:55,617
It's about this pie-eating contest.

620
00:42:55,701 --> 00:43:00,122
The main guy of the story is this fat kid
that nobody Iikes, named Davie Hogan.

621
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:03,041
Like Charlie Hogan's brother, if he had one.

622
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,418
Good, Vern.

623
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:06,920
Go on.

624
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:11,550
Well, this kid, he's our age, but he's fat.
Real fat.

625
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:16,471
He weighs close to 180,
but it's not his fault. It's his glands.

626
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,099
My cousin's Iike that. Sincerely.

627
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:23,604
She weighs over 300 pounds. Supposed
to be a "hyboid" gland or somethin'.

628
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:27,024
I don't know about any "hyboid" gland,
but what a blimp!

629
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,943
No shit.
She looks like a Thanksgiving turkey.

630
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:32,696
- And, you know, this one time...
- Shut up, Vern.

631
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:35,782
Right. Go on. It's a swell story.

632
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:41,830
All the kids, instead of calling him Davie,
they called him Lardass. Lardass Hogan.

633
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:45,083
Even his little brother
and sister called him Lardass.

634
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:48,962
At school they put this sticker on his back
that says, "Wide Load".

635
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:52,883
And they rank him out and beat him up
whenever they get a chance.

636
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,344
But one day he gets an idea.

637
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:01,266
The greatest revenge idea a kid ever had.

638
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:05,646
Is this thing on? Can you hear me?

639
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:10,818
The next contestant
in the Great Tri-County Pie Eat...

640
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:12,528
...Principal John Wiggins.

641
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:25,791
And our celebrity contestant,
from KLAM in Portland...

642
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,711
...The Boss-man himself, Bob Cormierl

643
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,468
From the racks and stacks
it's the best on wax...

644
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:40,597
...how about another double, golden oldie,
sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland...

645
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,099
...it's...
- Boss!

646
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,315
Next, a newcomer to the Pie Eat,
but one we expect...

647
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:54,528
...great things from in the future,
young Master David Hogan.

648
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:03,453
- Are you all right, young man?
- Lardass how was your trip?

649
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,666
I hear you got a big appetite, Lardass.

650
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,836
Don't even think about winning this.

651
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:13,630
Boy are you fat.

652
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:19,219
Don't pay attention to those fools,
Lardass. Davie.

653
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:35,527
And now,
the one you've all been waiting for.

654
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:40,199
The four-time champion,
our own Bill Travis.

655
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:49,082
Listen I got $10 riding
on you myself, Billy Boy.

656
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,794
All right. Are you ready?

657
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,340
Hands behind your backs, gentlemen.

658
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,133
Drum roll.

659
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:02,304
Hey, Lardass. Chow down, Wide Load.

660
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:06,725
Go.

661
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:14,650
Done!

662
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,459
Done!

663
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:35,921
Done!

664
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:40,801
You better pace yourself,
if you want to hold out.

665
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,177
Come on, Lardass!

666
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,179
Lardass, Lardass!

667
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:59,153
What the audience didn't know, was
that Lardass wasn't interested in winning.

668
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,905
What he wanted was revenge.

669
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:06,660
And right before he was introduced,
he'd gotten ready for it.

670
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,038
...Principal John Wiggins.

671
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:22,426
And our celebrity contestant
from KLAM in Portland...

672
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:26,763
...The Bossman himself, Bob Cormierl

673
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:33,270
From the racks and stacks
it's the best on wax...

674
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:37,441
...how about another double, golden oldie,
sound sandwich from KLAM in Portland...

675
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,442
...it's....

676
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:39,651
Done.

677
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:47,034
Diving into his fifth pie, Lardass began
to imagine that he wasn't eating pies.

678
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,578
He pretended he was eating cowflops...

679
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,872
...and rat guts in blueberry sauce.

680
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:53,665
Done.

681
00:47:56,877 --> 00:48:01,131
Slowly, a sound started to build
in Lardass's stomach.

682
00:48:02,382 --> 00:48:04,843
A strange and scary sound...

683
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:08,639
...like a log truck coming
atyou at 100 miles an hour.

684
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:25,239
Suddenly, Lardass opened his mouth...

685
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:28,450
...and before Bill Travis knew it...

686
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:32,412
...he was covered with five pies worth
of used blueberries.

687
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,457
The women in the audience screamed.

688
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:40,254
Bossman Bob Cormier took one Iook
at Bill Travis and barfed on Wiggins.

689
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,758
Wiggins barfed on the lumberjack
that was sitting next to him.

690
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:47,344
Mayor Grundy barfed on his wife's titsl

691
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,180
But when the smell hit the crowd...

692
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:53,892
...that's when Lardass's plan
really started to work.

693
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:55,894
Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends.

694
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,729
Kids barfed on theirparents.

695
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,523
A fatlady barfed in herpurse.

696
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,608
The Donelley twins barfed on each other.

697
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:06,697
The Women's Auxiliary barfed all over
the Benevolent Order ofAntelopes.

698
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,534
And Lardass just sat back
and enjoyed what he'd created.

699
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,998
A complete and total barfarama.

700
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:26,800
- Too cool!
- That was the best, just the best.

701
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,052
Then what happened?

702
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:30,470
What do you mean?

703
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:32,306
I mean, what happened?

704
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:36,643
What do you mean, "What happened?"
That's the end.

705
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:41,482
How can that be the end? What kind of an
ending is that? What happens to Lardass?

706
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:42,900
I don't know.

707
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:46,403
Maybe he went home and celebrated
with a couple of cheeseburgers.

708
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:49,323
Jesus, that ending sucks.

709
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:53,452
Why don't you make it
so that Lardass goes home...

710
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:55,037
...and he shoots his father.

711
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,623
Then he runs away
and he joins the Texas Rangers.

712
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:58,957
How about that?

713
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,417
I don't know.

714
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,544
Something good Iike that.

715
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:05,631
I Iike the ending. The barfing was good.

716
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,176
But there's one thing I didn't understand.

717
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:13,555
Did Lardass have to pay
to get into the contest?

718
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,934
No, Vern, they just Iet him in.

719
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,687
Great, great story.

720
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:23,524
It's a great story.
I just didn't Iike the ending.

721
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:26,610
Where's the radio?
Let's see if we can get some sounds.

722
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:27,611
Here.

723
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:37,913
We talked into the night.

724
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:41,792
The kind of talk thatseemed important
until you discover girls.

725
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,085
All right.

726
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:47,381
Mickey's a Mouse. Donald's a duck.
Pluto's a dog.

727
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:49,675
What's Goofy?

728
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:53,136
If I could only have one food
for the rest of my Iife?

729
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,264
That's easy. Pez.

730
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:58,725
Cherry flavoured Pez.
No question about it.

731
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:02,646
Goofy's a dog. He's definitely a dog.

732
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:07,359
I knew the $64,000 Question was fixed.

733
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:10,571
There's no way anybody can know
that much about opera.

734
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:15,159
He can't be a dog.
He wears a hat and drives a car.

735
00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:18,620
Wagon Train is a really cool show...

736
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:22,082
...but did you ever notice
that they never get anywhere?

737
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,418
They just keep wagon training.

738
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,421
God, that's weird.

739
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:29,715
What the hell is Goofy?

740
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:36,388
Not one of us mentioned Ray Brower,
but we were all thinking about him.

741
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,062
Oh, my God.

742
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,772
It's the Brower kid.

743
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:48,192
His ghost is out walking in the woods.

744
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:52,946
I promise I won't hock
no more dirty books.

745
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,242
I promise I won't say no more bad swears.
I promise I'll eat my Iima beans.

746
00:51:58,076 --> 00:51:59,578
Two for flinching.

747
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,626
What is it, Chris?

748
00:52:06,877 --> 00:52:08,378
Maybe it's coyotes.

749
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:10,714
Sounds Iike a woman screaming.

750
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,050
It's not coyotes. It's his ghost.

751
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,593
Don't say that.

752
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,303
Teddy, sit down.

753
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:19,014
I'm gonna go Iook for it.
I want to see the ghost.

754
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:20,265
Don't say that.

755
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:23,477
I just want to see it!
I just want to see what he Iooks Iike.

756
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,354
Jesus H. Bald-headed Christ!

757
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,654
Maybe we should stand guard.

758
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,323
That's a good idea.

759
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:41,036
Give me the gun. I'll take the first watch.

760
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:58,470
23:00 hours.
Corporal Teddy Duchamp stands guard.

761
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,143
No sign of the enemy. The fort is secure.

762
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,564
Shut up, Teddy, and keep your eyes peeled.

763
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,826
- Cut it out.
- I'm trying to sleep.

764
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:26,165
The dogfaces rested easy...

765
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,917
...in the knowledge that
Corporal Teddy Duchamp...

766
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:32,171
...was protecting all that was dear to them.

767
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:08,392
It should have been you, Gordon.

768
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:12,896
Are you okay?

769
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:17,359
You were dreaming.

770
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:30,581
I didn't cry at Denny's funeral.

771
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:37,212
I miss him, Chris.

772
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:39,298
I really miss him.

773
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,050
I know.

774
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,556
Go back to sleep.

775
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:32,142
Maybe you could go
into the college courses with me.

776
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,977
That'll be the day.

777
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:36,772
Why not? You're smart enough.

778
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,315
They won't Iet me.

779
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:41,819
What do you mean?

780
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:45,572
It's the way the people think
of my family in this town.

781
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:49,868
It's the way they think of me. I'm just one
of those Iow-life Chambers kids.

782
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:51,453
That's not true.

783
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:53,455
It is.

784
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:57,209
No one asked me if I took the milk money.

785
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:00,003
I just got a three-day vacation.

786
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:07,344
Did you take it?

787
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:10,097
Yeah, I took it. You knew I took it.

788
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:12,891
Teddy knew I took it.

789
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:17,062
Everyone knew I took it.
Even Vern knew, I think.

790
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,611
Maybe I was sorry,
and I tried to give it back.

791
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:26,905
You tried to give it back?

792
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:29,449
Maybe, just maybe.

793
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:35,247
Maybe I took it to Old Lady Simons
and told her, and the money was all there.

794
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:39,001
But I still got a three-day vacation,
because it never showed up.

795
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:41,587
And maybe the next week,
old Lady Simons...

796
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,840
...had this brand new skirt on
when she came to school.

797
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:48,051
Yeah, it was brown and it had dots on it.

798
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:53,473
Let's just say that I stole the milk money,
but old Lady Simons stole it back from me.

799
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:56,268
Just suppose that I told this story.

800
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:59,521
Me, Chris Chambers,
kid brother to Eyeball Chambers.

801
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:02,024
Do you think anyone
would have believed it?

802
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:02,733
No.

803
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:06,987
You think that bitch would have tried that
if it had been one of those douche bags...

804
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:09,531
...from The View,
if they had taken the money?

805
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:11,033
- No way.
- Hell, no.

806
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:13,202
But, with me....

807
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:22,002
I'm sure she had her eye on that skirt
for a long time.

808
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:25,255
Anyway, she saw her chance
and she took it.

809
00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:29,301
I was the stupid one
for even trying to give it back.

810
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:38,101
I just never thought....

811
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:43,106
I never thought that a teacher....

812
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:47,694
Who gives a fuck anyway?

813
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,078
I just wish...

814
00:58:56,995 --> 00:59:00,415
...that I could go someplace
where nobody knows me.

815
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,304
I guess I'm just a pussy.

816
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:17,015
No way, man.

817
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:05,314
The freight woke up the other guys...

818
01:00:05,397 --> 01:00:09,818
...and it was on the tip of my tongue
to tell them about the deer, but I didn't.

819
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:13,363
That was the one thing I kept to myself.

820
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:16,533
I've neverspoken or written ofit
untiljust now.

821
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,794
How come you didn't get
some breakfast stuff like...

822
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:30,005
...Twinkies, and Pez, and root beer?

823
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:35,761
Sorry. I guess a more experienced shopper
could've gotten more for your 7 cents.

824
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:40,933
With ourstomachs rumbling,
we pressed on toward the Royal River.

825
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:46,104
The reality of Ray Brower was growing,
and kept us moving despite the heat.

826
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:50,067
For me, the idea
ofseeing that kid's dead body...

827
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,569
...was starting to become an obsession.

828
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:06,458
Gentlemen, the Royal.

829
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:11,839
God, the tracks go way out of the way.

830
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:15,759
We cut across this field right here,
we'll be there in an hour.

831
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:19,346
I think we should stick to the tracks.

832
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:21,390
I say we go across the field.

833
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:23,058
Gordie?

834
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:25,727
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

835
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:28,063
Take no prisoners!

836
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:33,485
You guys, it's a lot safer if we....

837
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,239
Come on, men. Let's take on the....

838
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:39,616
You don't know what's in those woods.

839
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:44,454
You guys, wait up for me!

840
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:56,842
I gotta tell you something,
but swear on your mother's name...

841
01:01:56,925 --> 01:01:58,719
...that you won't tell anybody.

842
01:01:58,802 --> 01:01:59,928
You got it, pal.

843
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,434
Eyeball, you know that Brower kid?

844
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:06,810
What about him?

845
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:10,606
I'll tell you something, but you must swear
on your mother's good name...

846
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:11,982
...you won't tell nobody.

847
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:16,528
Billy and Charlie had managed to keep
their enormous secret for about 36 hours.

848
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,864
A personal record for both of them.

849
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:22,951
By noon, Ace and Eyeball had told
their secret to everybody in the gang.

850
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:27,372
I guess for those guys, protecting their
mother's good name wasn't a top priority.

851
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:31,126
Ace, maybe me and Charlie shouldn't go.

852
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,462
Maybe you could go without us?

853
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:37,549
You guys are acting like my grandmother
having a conniption fit.

854
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:39,009
I don't see your problem.

855
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:42,679
We take a bunch of fishing gear,
so if a cop asks us what we're doing:

856
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:47,684
"We're here to take a couple of steelhead
out of the river. Look what we found".

857
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:50,062
Come on, man, we're gonna be famous.

858
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:53,190
We'll be on every radio and TV show
in the country.

859
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,609
I still don't think we should go.

860
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:56,819
Okay.

861
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:00,864
You've stated your position clearly.

862
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,866
Now, I'm gonna state mine.

863
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,953
Get in the fucking car. Now!

864
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:07,371
Let's go, man.

865
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,263
- I hate this shortcut.
- "I hate this shortcut".

866
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:29,560
You flinched! Two for flinching.

867
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:35,023
But you flinched.

868
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,359
I know. Two for flinching.

869
01:03:57,838 --> 01:03:59,840
How are we supposed to get across this?

870
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:02,551
- We use you as a raft.
- Very funny.

871
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:15,856
It's not that deep. We can walk across.

872
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:28,869
I told you we should have stuck
to the tracks.

873
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:33,999
Is it me,
or are you the world's biggest pussy?

874
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,877
I suppose this is fun for you.

875
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:39,254
No, but this is.

876
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:42,966
Want some more?

877
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:46,512
- Stop it, come on!
- Act your age.

878
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:47,679
This is my age.

879
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:50,599
I'm in the prime of my youth,
and I'll only be young once.

880
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:53,560
But you're going to be stupid
for the rest of your Iife.

881
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:57,064
That's it, Chambers.
You just signed your own death warrant.

882
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:58,899
You die, Chambers!

883
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,239
Get him, Chambers!

884
01:05:05,948 --> 01:05:09,243
- Vern's afraid he's gonna die!
- Teddy, you're gonna die!

885
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:15,332
Where do you think
you're going, Lachance?

886
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,543
Come on, you guys.

887
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:19,336
Pile on!

888
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:22,923
I don't want to do this.

889
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,676
Get off!

890
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:29,680
- Sleeper hold.
- Stop it. I'm serious.

891
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:32,307
No one gets out of the sleeper hold.

892
01:05:32,391 --> 01:05:36,603
- Vern, there's something on your neck.
- I'm not falling for that one, Lachance.

893
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:38,564
No, there is something on your neck.

894
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,816
It's a Ieech. Leeches!

895
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:42,484
- Oh, my God!
- Leeches!

896
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:58,000
Get them off!

897
01:05:58,167 --> 01:05:59,334
Lay off me!

898
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:04,506
- Gordie, there's some on your back.
- Get them off!

899
01:06:06,216 --> 01:06:07,843
Are there any on mine?

900
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:31,033
Oh, shit, Chris.

901
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:34,912
Oh, shit, man.

902
01:06:57,351 --> 01:06:58,894
Are you okay?

903
01:07:00,938 --> 01:07:02,314
Can you hear me?

904
01:07:03,315 --> 01:07:04,566
Are you there?

905
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:06,235
Maybe he's dead.

906
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:08,570
He's not dead. He's still breathing, idiot.

907
01:07:08,654 --> 01:07:09,696
I don't know.

908
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,658
Just cool it, you guys. He just fainted.

909
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:20,040
I never met anybody who fainted before.

910
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:24,294
Maybe he made a bad mistake
and looked at your face.

911
01:07:24,378 --> 01:07:25,838
Shut up, Teddy.

912
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,464
You okay?

913
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:30,384
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

914
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:38,350
Maybe we should take Gordie back.

915
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:41,228
Great, Chambers,
now you're turning pussy, too!

916
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:44,815
What's your problem?
He had a leech on his balls. He fainted.

917
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:46,108
Are you his mother?

918
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:48,068
- Eat shit.
- You eat shit.

919
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:51,947
I think Chris is right. Let's go back.

920
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:55,826
What a surprise! The king of the pussies
wants to go back, too.

921
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,120
- Stop calling me that.
- What, "pussy"? Pussy!

922
01:07:58,203 --> 01:07:59,788
- Stop it!
- Pussy!

923
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:01,498
You four-eyed psycho!

924
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:03,083
Get off me!

925
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,462
Two for flinching.
Do I get two for flinching?

926
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:08,797
You Iike it, Teddy?

927
01:08:08,881 --> 01:08:11,758
- Come on, you guys. Break it up.
- Stop it!

928
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:22,686
I'm not going back.

929
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:29,985
- Idiot.
- Shut up! Retard.

930
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,994
At the time, I didn't know why I needed
to see that body so badly.

931
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:42,873
Even if no one had followed me,
I would have gone on alone.

932
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:58,889
No way, Ace! Not this time, man.
No way!

933
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:01,517
- Go for it, Vince.
- You want to race?

934
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:14,613
Oh, my God, I got him.

935
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:19,284
You are history. History!

936
01:09:19,618 --> 01:09:21,912
- Fall back, Ace.
- Don't fuck around.

937
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,126
Jesus Christ, Ace! Fall back, man!

938
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:46,603
Shit, man! Shit!

939
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:48,021
I won.

940
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:52,484
You let him beat you, you cock-knocker.

941
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:05,581
Coming though the woods,
I bet we saved over an hour.

942
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:13,338
Is this the Back Harlow Road?

943
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:18,468
The Brower kid must be
around here someplace.

944
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,929
Teddy and Vern
watch the Ieft side of the tracks.

945
01:10:21,013 --> 01:10:23,182
- We'll take the right.
- All right.

946
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:38,864
There he is! I see him! Look!

947
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:41,116
Look over there! I see him!

948
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:46,038
None of us could breathe.

949
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:49,917
Somewhere under those bushes
was the rest of Ray Brower.

950
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:05,015
The train had knocked Ray
out of his Keds...

951
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:08,018
...just like it had knocked the Iife
out of his body.

952
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:09,102
Jesus.

953
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:12,940
The kid wasn'tsick.

954
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:15,234
The kid wasn'tsleeping.

955
01:11:16,193 --> 01:11:17,611
The kid was dead.

956
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:36,839
Let's look for some long branches.
We'll build him a stretcher.

957
01:11:50,102 --> 01:11:51,103
Gordie?

958
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:01,446
Why did you have to die?

959
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:04,199
What's the matter with Gordie?

960
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:05,367
Nothing.

961
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:08,370
You guys just go over there
and look for some branches?

962
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:09,163
Okay.

963
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:23,427
Why did he have to die, Chris?

964
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:27,431
Why did Denny have to die? Why?

965
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,059
I don't know.

966
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:35,105
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that.

967
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,858
- It should have been me.
- Don't say that, man.

968
01:12:39,443 --> 01:12:42,988
I'm no good. My dad said it. I'm no good.

969
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:44,698
He doesn't know you.

970
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,326
He hates me.

971
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:48,911
He doesn't hate you.

972
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,455
- He hates me.
- No.

973
01:12:51,622 --> 01:12:53,373
He just doesn't know you.

974
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:56,835
He hates me. My dad hates me.

975
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:01,006
He hates me. Oh, God.

976
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,115
You're gonna be a great writer someday.

977
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:33,080
You might even write about us guys,
if you ever get hard-up for material.

978
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:54,059
I guess I'd have to be pretty hard-up?

979
01:13:56,895 --> 01:13:57,813
Yeah.

980
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:03,652
What the fuck do you know about this?

981
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:06,989
Son of a bitch! My Iittle brother.

982
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:13,579
You wasn't planning on taking
the body from us, was you, boys?

983
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,790
You get away.

984
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:18,750
We found him. We got dibs.

985
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:23,130
We better start running, Eyeball.
They got dibs.

986
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:27,092
We earned him. You guys came in a car.
That's not fair. He's ours.

987
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:29,094
"That's not fair. He's ours".

988
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,180
Well, not anymore.

989
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:34,600
There are four of us, Eyeball.
You just make your move.

990
01:14:34,808 --> 01:14:36,727
We will. Don't you worry.

991
01:14:41,482 --> 01:14:44,234
Vern, you little son of a whore.

992
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:47,654
- You was under the porch.
- No, I swear it wasn't me.

993
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:51,492
You keyhole-peeping bung.
I ought to beat the living shit out of you.

994
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:00,000
You guys have two choices.

995
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:03,921
Either leave quietly and we take the body...

996
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:07,257
...or you stay
and we beat the shit out of you.

997
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:09,259
And we take the body.

998
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:13,055
- Besides, me and Billy found him first.
- Vern told us how you found him.

999
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:16,517
"Billy, I wish we'd never boosted that car".

1000
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:20,854
"Billy, I think I just turned
my Fruit of the Looms into fudge factory".

1001
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:23,440
- That's it. Your ass is grass!
- Hold it.

1002
01:15:26,944 --> 01:15:30,447
Okay, Chambers, you little faggot.
This is your Iast chance.

1003
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:33,742
What do you say, kid?

1004
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,247
Why don't you go home
and fuck your mother some more?

1005
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,169
You're dead.

1006
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:46,505
Come on, let's split.

1007
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:49,424
- They're not taking him.
- Come on, this is crazy.

1008
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:51,927
- They're not taking him.
- He's got a knife, man.

1009
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:54,346
Ace, come on.

1010
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:01,728
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.

1011
01:16:01,812 --> 01:16:03,063
No problem.

1012
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:20,080
You're not taking him.
Nobody's taking him.

1013
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:25,836
Come on, kid, just give me the gun
before you take your foot off.

1014
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:29,882
You ain't got the sack
to shoot a woodchuck.

1015
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:32,467
Don't move, Ace.

1016
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:36,513
I'll kill you. I swear to God.

1017
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:41,101
Come on, Lachance, give me the gun.

1018
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:46,773
You must have at least some
of your brother's good sense.

1019
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:55,449
Suck my fat one,
you cheap dime-store hood.

1020
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:04,708
What are you going to do, shoot us all?

1021
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,169
No, just you.

1022
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:20,015
We're gonna get you for this.

1023
01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:22,643
Maybe you will and maybe you won't.

1024
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:24,520
We will.

1025
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:40,786
We're not going to forget this,
if that's what you're thinking.

1026
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:43,247
This is big time, baby.

1027
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,057
"Suck my fat one"?

1028
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:06,186
Whoever told you,
you had a fat one, Lachance?

1029
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:09,648
Biggest one in four counties.

1030
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,626
Are we going to take him?

1031
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:30,836
No.

1032
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:34,882
But we came all this way?

1033
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:37,843
We're supposed to be heroes.

1034
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:40,971
Not this way, Teddy.

1035
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:46,435
Chris, give me a hand.

1036
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:51,106
Ray Brower's body was found...

1037
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:54,276
...but neither our gang
nor their gang got the credit.

1038
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:58,780
We decided that an anonymous phone call
was the best thing to do.

1039
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:09,124
We headed home. And although
many thoughts raced through our minds...

1040
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,376
...we barely spoke.

1041
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:17,966
We walked all night
and made it back to Castle Rock...

1042
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:22,805
...a Iittle past 5:00 on Sunday morning,
the day before Labour Day.

1043
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:28,393
We'd only been gone two days,
butsomehow the town seemed different...

1044
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:30,354
...smaller.

1045
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:50,499
See you in school.

1046
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:56,338
See you in Junior High.

1047
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:11,436
Penny.

1048
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:24,283
I better get home, before my mom
puts me on the "10 Most Wanted List".

1049
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,171
No hard feelings, okay?

1050
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:39,298
No way, man.

1051
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:07,159
As time went on we saw less and less
of Teddy and Vern...

1052
01:21:07,743 --> 01:21:11,497
...until eventually they became
just two more faces in the halls.

1053
01:21:11,622 --> 01:21:13,207
It happens sometimes.

1054
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:17,044
Friends come in and out ofyourlife
like busboys in a restaurant.

1055
01:21:17,586 --> 01:21:21,131
I heard that Vern got married
out of high school, had four kids...

1056
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:24,885
...and is now the forklift operator
at the Arsenault Lumber Yard.

1057
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:29,473
Teddy tried to getinto the Army,
but his eyes and his ear kept him out.

1058
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:32,017
Last I'd heard
he'd spentsome time in jail...

1059
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,978
...and was now doing oddjobs
around Castle Rock.

1060
01:21:43,445 --> 01:21:46,448
I'm never gonna get out of this town,
am I, Gordie?

1061
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:50,327
You can do anything you want, man.

1062
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,498
Sure.

1063
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:04,550
Give me some skin.

1064
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:15,060
I'll see you.

1065
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:17,271
Not if I see you first.

1066
01:22:22,192 --> 01:22:23,652
Chris did get out.

1067
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:25,988
He enrolled in the college courses with me.

1068
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:29,616
And although it was hard,
he gutted it outlike he always did.

1069
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:32,828
He went on to college
and eventually became a lawyer.

1070
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:36,248
Last week,
he entered a fast-food restaurant.

1071
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:39,501
Just ahead of him,
two men gotinto an argument.

1072
01:22:39,585 --> 01:22:41,211
One of them pulled a knife.

1073
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:44,882
Chris, who'd always made the bestpeace,
tried to break it up.

1074
01:22:45,757 --> 01:22:47,468
He was stabbed in the throat.

1075
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:49,303
He died almost instantly.

1076
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:11,325
Dad, can we go now?

1077
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:15,579
- You ready?
- We've been ready for an hour.

1078
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:20,459
I'll be right there.

1079
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:22,711
He said that a half hour ago.

1080
01:23:22,794 --> 01:23:25,839
My dad's weird.
He gets like that when he's writing.
