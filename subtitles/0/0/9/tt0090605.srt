1
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:50,810
Bio-readouts are all in the green.
Looks like she's alive.

2
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:56,085
There goes our salvage, guys.

3
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:24,445
- How are we today?
- Terrible.

4
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,446
- Well, better than yesterday, at least.
- Where am I?

5
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:32,321
You're safe. You're at Gateway Station,
been here a couple of days.

6
00:05:32,413 --> 00:05:35,883
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're OK.

7
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:38,646
Looks like you've got a visitor.

8
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:42,288
Jonesy. Come here!

9
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:45,364
Hey, come here.

10
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:47,762
How are you, you stupid cat?

11
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:50,492
How are you? Where have you been?

12
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:55,202
I guess you two have met, huh?
I'm Burke. Carter Burke.

13
00:05:55,293 --> 00:06:01,050
I work for the company. But don't
let that fool you. I'm really an OK guy.

14
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:06,491
I'm glad you're a little better. The weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

15
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:12,170
It's just natural side effects
of such an unusually long hyper sleep.

16
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:16,690
What do you mean?
How long was I out there?

17
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:21,811
- Has no one discussed this with you yet?
- No.

18
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:26,967
But, I mean, I don't... recognize this place.

19
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,521
No, I know. Uh... OK.

20
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:33,049
It's just that, uh, this might be
a shock to you. It's longer...

21
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:36,205
How long? Please.

22
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,368
57 years.

23
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:45,052
- What?!
- You were out there for 57 years.

24
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:49,170
You had drifted
right through the core systems,

25
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:54,930
and it's really just blind luck that a
deep-salvage team found you when they did.

26
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:59,404
It's one in a thousand, really. I think
you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.

27
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:02,929
You could be floating out there forever.

28
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:05,004
Are you OK?

29
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:16,163
Are you OK?

30
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:26,449
God!

31
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,970
Nurse! Please!

32
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,090
Someone get in here now!

33
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:33,845
- No!
- Now!

34
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,129
- Hold!
- Please!

35
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:39,325
Hold her!

36
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:41,287
Kill me!

37
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,322
No!

38
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,484
No!

39
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,011
Bad dreams again?
You want something to help you sleep?

40
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:05,245
No. I've slept enough.

41
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,968
Jonesy. Come here.

42
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,811
It's all right.

43
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,811
It's all right.

44
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,417
It's over.

45
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,974
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
- Is there any word about my daughter?

46
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,531
I think we should worry about the hearing
now, cos we don't have a lot of time.

47
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,579
I read your deposition, and it's great.
If you stick to that, we'll be fine.

48
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,254
There are gonna be
a lot of heavyweights there -

49
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,573
feds, Interstellar Commerce Commission,
Colonial Administration, insurance guys...

50
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,220
Do you have any news about my daughter?

51
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,693
We did come up with some information.
Why don't we sit down?

52
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,659
I was hoping to wait until after the inquest...

53
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,368
Amanda Ripley-McClaren -
married name, I guess -

54
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,849
aged 66.

55
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,250
And that was at the time of her death.

56
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,729
Which was two years ago.

57
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,815
I'm real sorry.

58
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,291
Amy...

59
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,535
Um... She was cremated and interred at
Westlake Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.

60
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,009
No children. I checked.

61
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,216
I promised her...
that I'd be home for her birthday.

62
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,059
Her 11th birthday.

63
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,844
We have been here for three and a half hours.

64
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:37,397
How many different ways
do you want me to tell the same story?

65
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:41,162
Look at it from our perspective, please.

66
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,238
Please.

67
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:50,641
You admit to detonating the engines of, and
thereby destroying, an M-Class star-freighter,

68
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:53,036
a rather expensive piece of hardware.

69
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:58,963
42 million in adjusted dollars.
That's minus payload, of course.

70
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:03,325
The lifeboat's flight recorder
corroborates some elements of your account,

71
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:08,276
<i>in that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down on LV-426,</i>

72
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,279
an unsurveyed planet at that time.

73
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:15,997
That it resumed its course and was
subsequently set for self-destruct, by you,

74
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:19,841
- for reasons unknown.
- Not for reasons unknown. I told you.

75
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:25,399
We set down there on company orders
to get this thing, which destroyed my crew.

76
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:27,796
And your expensive ship.

77
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,482
The analysis team, which went over
the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,

78
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,161
found no evidence
of the creature you describe.

79
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:39,037
Good! That's because I blew it
out of the goddamn airlock.

80
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,038
Like I said.

81
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:48,086
Are there any species
like this hostile organism on LV-426?

82
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:51,603
No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.

83
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:55,963
Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away?

84
00:11:56,047 --> 00:12:01,075
Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous.
It was a derelict spacecraft, an alien ship.

85
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:05,558
It was not from there. Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

86
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:11,722
And found something never recorded once
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

87
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:17,723
"A creature that gestates inside a living
human host." These are your words.

88
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:22,358
- "And has concentrated acid for blood."
- That's right.

89
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:25,598
Look, I can see where this is going.

90
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:30,566
- But I'm telling you that those things exist.
- Thank you. That will be all.

91
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:34,117
Please! You're not listening to me.
Kane, the crew member...

92
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:38,519
Kane, who went into that ship,
said he saw thousands of eggs there.

93
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:42,156
<i>- Thank you, that will be all.
- Goddammit, that's not all!</i>

94
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,602
Because if one of those things
gets down here,

95
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,598
you can kiss all this bullshit goodbye!

96
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:04,936
It is the finding of this court of enquiry
that Warrant Officer E Ripley, NOC 14472,

97
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:08,224
has acted with questionable judgment,

98
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:13,665
and is unfit to hold an ICC license
as a commercial flight officer.

99
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:18,616
Said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely.

100
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:25,146
No criminal charges will be filed, and
you are released on your own recognizance

101
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:28,537
for a six-month period
of psychometric probation,

102
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:33,985
to include monthly review
by an ICC psychiatric technician.

103
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,824
These proceedings are closed.

104
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,215
That could have been... better.

105
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,609
- Look, I think the... Ripley!
- Van Leuwen?

106
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,975
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

107
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,654
Because I don't have to.
There have been people there over 20 years,

108
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,776
and they never complained
about any hostile organism.

109
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:06,692
- What people?
- Terraformers.

110
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:12,217
Planet engineers. They set up big atmosphere
processors to make the air breathable.

111
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,417
Takes decades. It's what we call
a "shake 'n' bake" colony.

112
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:18,649
How many are there? Colonists?

113
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:23,562
60, maybe 70 families. Do you mind?

114
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:29,026
Families.

115
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,993
Jesus.

116
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,550
- I'll be down in Maintenance, OK?
- Al?

117
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:50,308
- What?
- Hey, Al?

118
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:55,423
Remember you sent some wildcatters
out into the middle of nowhere last week?

119
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:59,713
One of them's on the horn,
says he's onto something.

120
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:02,992
- Wants to know if his claim will be honored.
- Why wouldn't it be?

121
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:06,704
Because you sent them out there
on company orders? I don't know.

122
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:11,664
Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on Earth
says go look at a grid reference.

123
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,872
We look. They don't say why, and I don't ask,

124
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:20,109
because it takes two weeks to get an answer,
and the answer is always "Don't ask."

125
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:22,311
So what do I tell this guy?

126
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:26,149
Tell him as far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.

127
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,669
- Lydecker?
- What?

128
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:35,024
You kids know you're not supposed to be
on this level. Go on, get outta here.

129
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:08,195
- You go in places we can't fit.
- So? That's why I'm the best.

130
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:12,746
Knock it off. I catch either of you playing
in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.

131
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:14,985
- All the kids play in the...
- I don't care!

132
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:19,751
Wait a minute.
Annie, come and have look at this, will ya?

133
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:30,673
Folks, we have scored big this time.

134
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:39,310
What is it, Dad?

135
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:44,307
I'm not sure.

136
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:49,304
Let's see if we can get a closer look at it
through that crack down the side.

137
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:53,354
- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.

138
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:02,834
That's about as close as we can get.
Shall we take a look inside?

139
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:20,147
You kids stay inside. I mean it.
We'll be right back.

140
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,226
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

141
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:40,027
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

142
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,629
It'll be OK, Newt. Dad knows what he's doing.

143
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:51,033
Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control!

144
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:40,138
Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman
of the Colonial Marine Corps...

145
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:42,420
Ripley, we have to talk.

146
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:46,293
We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426.

147
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:54,421
I don't believe this.

148
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:58,896
You guys throw me at the wolves,
and now you want me to go back out there?

149
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:01,499
Forget it. It's not my problem.

150
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:04,895
- Can I finish?
- No. There's no way.

151
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:10,861
Ripley, you wouldn't be going in with
the troops. I can guarantee your safety.

152
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,937
These Colonial Marines
are very tough hombres.

153
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:18,416
They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.
There's nothing they can't handle.

154
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:19,904
Lieutenant, am I right?

155
00:21:19,985 --> 00:21:23,136
We've been trained
to deal with situations like this.

156
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,022
Then you don't need me.

157
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:29,915
We don't know
exactly what's going on out there.

158
00:21:33,174 --> 00:21:37,053
I would like you there as an adviser,
and that's all.

159
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:43,967
What's your interest in all this?
Why are you going?

160
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:48,332
The corporation co-financed that colony
along with Colonial Administration.

161
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:51,486
We're into a lot of terraforming,
building better worlds...

162
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:55,533
Yeah, I saw the commercial.
Look, I've gotta get to work.

163
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:00,292
I heard you're working in the cargo docks.

164
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,148
- Running forklifts?
- Yeah. So?

165
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:07,309
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

166
00:22:07,397 --> 00:22:12,755
And I know it's the only thing you could get.
There's nothing wrong with it.

167
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:18,465
What if I told you I could
get you reinstated as a flight officer?

168
00:22:18,557 --> 00:22:22,311
The company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.

169
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:24,388
If I go.

170
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:29,072
Yeah, if you go.
Come on! That's a second chance, kiddo.

171
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:33,947
I think for you it would be best
to face this thing, get back on the horse...

172
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:36,995
Spare me, Burke. I've had
my psych evaluation this month.

173
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:40,956
I know. I read it. You wake up every night,
your sheets soaking with sweat...

174
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:43,232
I said no, and I mean it!

175
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:51,947
Now please leave. I am not going back, and...
I would not be any good to you if I did.

176
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:53,955
OK.

177
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:59,713
Would you do me a favor?
Just think about it.

178
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,712
Thanks for the coffee.

179
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,873
Hello?

180
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:13,629
Ripley.

181
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:17,907
- You OK?
- Just tell me one thing, Burke.

182
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:21,148
You're going out there to destroy them, right?

183
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:25,992
Not to study, not to bring back,
but to wipe them out.

184
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:29,955
That's the plan. You have my word on it.

185
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:34,236
All right, I'm in.

186
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:45,507
And you, you little shithead...

187
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:49,963
You're staying here.

188
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:18,047
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

189
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,211
Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.

190
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,449
What? Is that a joke?

191
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:25,530
Oh, I wish it were.

192
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:30,374
Hey, Hicks. Man, you look just like I feel.

193
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:35,690
OK, sweethearts, what are you waiting for?
Breakfast in bed?

194
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:40,807
Another glorious day in the Corps. A day
in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm.

195
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:45,575
Every meal's a banquet, every paycheck
a fortune, every formation a parade.

196
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,572
- I love the Corps!
- Man, this floor is freezing.

197
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:53,971
- Want me to fetch your slippers for you?
- Gee, would you, sir? I'd like that.

198
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:58,814
Look into my eye.
Fall in, people. Come on, let's go.

199
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:02,653
- I hate this job.
- Crowe! Wierzbowski! On your feet!

200
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:05,412
You just had three weeks on your back.

201
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:08,491
I'm talkin' about breathing,
not this frozen shit.

202
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:10,695
Yeah, Top, how about it?

203
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:17,778
All right, first assembly's in 15, people.
Shag it!

204
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:21,487
<i>Hey, mira. Who's Snow White?</i>

205
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:24,853
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

206
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:29,217
- Apparently she saw an alien once.
- Whoopee-fucking-do!

207
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:31,893
<i>- I'm impressed.
- Qu bonita!</i>

208
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:38,412
Hey, Vasquez. Have you
ever been mistaken for a man?

209
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,410
No. Have you?

210
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:42,248
Oh, Vasquez!

211
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:47,336
You're just too bad.

212
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:57,939
Hey, Top. What's the op?

213
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,169
It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.

214
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:05,413
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity!

215
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:07,694
Dumb-ass colonists!

216
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:14,014
- What's this crap supposed to be?
- Corn bread, I think.

217
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,897
- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.
- Hey.

218
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:21,052
I sure wouldn't mind gettin' some more
Arcturian poontang. Remember that?

219
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:26,293
- Yeah, Frost, but the one you had was male!
- Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby.

220
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:29,132
- Hey, Bishop. Do the thing with the knife.
- Oh, please.

221
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:31,335
- Come on.
- Do it, baby.

222
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,934
- All right!
- I don't wanna see that, man.

223
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:41,850
- Hey, what are you doin', man?
- Don't move. Just shut up.

224
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:43,418
Bishop?! Hey, man!

225
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:45,491
- Do it, Bishop.
- Not me, man!

226
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:47,934
- Yeah, you.
- Quit messin' around. Come on!

227
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,213
Trust me.

228
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:06,249
- All right, knock it off.
- Thank you.

229
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:13,253
- Enjoy your meal.
- That wasn't funny, man.

230
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:19,696
- Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?
- Yeah, thanks.

231
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:26,057
Looks like the new lieutenant's
too good to eat with the rest of us grunts.

232
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:29,131
The boy's definitely got a corncob up his ass.

233
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,288
Thought you never missed, Bishop.

234
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:40,336
You never said anything about
an android being on board. Why not?

235
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:43,570
It never occurred to me.
It's just common practice.

236
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:49,894
- We always have a synthetic on board.
- I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.

237
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:54,495
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry. I don't know why I didn't even...

238
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:59,050
Ripley's last trip out, the synth...
the artificial person malfunctioned.

239
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:02,609
There were problems,
and a few deaths were involved.

240
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:07,773
- I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
- Yeah, the Hyperdyne Systems 120-A/2.

241
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:10,976
That explains it.
The A/2s always were a bit twitchy.

242
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:13,732
That can't happen
with our behavioral inhibitors.

243
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:19,052
It is impossible for me to harm,
or allow to be harmed, a human being.

244
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,699
You sure you don't want some?

245
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:27,419
You just stay away from me, Bishop.
You got that straight?

246
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:30,532
I guess she don't like the corn bread either.

247
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:47,458
- Squad, atten-ho! Officer on deck!
- As you were.

248
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,212
Quickly, quickly. Settle down.

249
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,290
All right, listen up!

250
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:58,128
Morning, Marines. I'm sorry we didn't have
time to brief you before we left Gateway...

251
00:31:58,219 --> 00:32:00,608
- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?

252
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:03,647
Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.

253
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:08,649
- What's the question?
- Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,

254
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,378
or another bug hunt?

255
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,257
All we know is there's still
no contact with the colony,

256
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:17,092
and that a xenomorph may be involved.

257
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:19,818
- Excuse me, sir. A what?
- A xenomorph.

258
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,015
It's a bug hunt.

259
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:26,456
- What exactly are we dealing with here?
- Ripley?

260
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,973
I'll tell you what I know.

261
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,414
We set down on LV-426.

262
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,808
A crew member was brought back on board

263
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:37,892
with something attached to his face,
some kind of parasite.

264
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:43,007
We tried to get it off, it wouldn't come off.
Later it seemed to come off by itself and die.

265
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:47,729
Kane seemed fine.
We were all having dinner and, um...

266
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:51,732
It must have laid something inside his throat,
some sort of embryo.

267
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:54,538
He started, um... he...

268
00:32:54,619 --> 00:33:00,615
Look, man. I only need to know one thing:
Where they are.

269
00:33:00,699 --> 00:33:03,338
- Go, Vasquez. Kick ass.
- Anytime, anywhere, man.

270
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,890
Somebody said "alien". She thought
they said "illegal alien" and signed up.

271
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:10,573
- Fuck you, man.
- Anytime, anywhere.

272
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:13,412
Are you finished?

273
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:20,172
I hope you're right. I really do.

274
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:25,257
Yeah. OK, right. Thank you, Ripley.

275
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:28,217
We have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

276
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:32,929
Because just one of those things managed to
wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

277
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:37,376
If the colonists found that ship, there's no
telling how many of them have been exposed.

278
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:39,734
Do you understand?

279
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:45,091
Anyway, we have it on disk,
so you'd better look at it.

280
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,170
Any questions?

281
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:52,497
- What is it, Private?
- How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?

282
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:55,218
You secure that shit, Hudson.

283
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:58,810
All right.

284
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:01,094
Now listen up.

285
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:07,530
I want this thing to go smooth,
and by the numbers.

286
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:12,135
I want DCS and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.

287
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:17,168
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
dropship prep details will have seven hours.

288
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:19,295
Now move it, people!

289
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:23,497
All right, sweethearts. You heard the man,
you know the drill. Assholes and elbows!

290
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:26,013
Hudson, come here. Come here!

291
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:43,452
<i>I don't care if you are short, Hudson.
Get it done!</i>

292
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:48,693
- You'll get lip cancer smokin' those!
- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed!

293
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:51,339
- How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

294
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,614
Take it away.

295
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:11,614
Clear behind!

296
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:19,973
Did you check number three?
Is this the non-op?

297
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:23,768
Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here.
Is there anything I can do?

298
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:27,488
I don't know. Is there anything you can do?

299
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:32,016
Well, I can drive that loader.

300
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,329
I have a Class 2 rating.

301
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:36,774
Be my guest.

302
00:36:20,459 --> 00:36:22,097
Where you want it?

303
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,498
Bay 12, please.

304
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:25,049
All right. You're a team,
and there's nothing to worry about.

305
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:29,929
We come here, and we're gonna conquer,
and we're gonna kick some. Understood?

306
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:33,648
That's what we're gonna do, sweethearts.
We are going to go and get some.

307
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:36,333
All right, people. On the ready line.

308
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:37,772
- Are you lean?
- Yeah!

309
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,212
- Are you mean?
- Yeah!

310
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,767
- What are you?
- Lean, mean marines!

311
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:46,137
Hudson! Get on the ready line!
Get some today!

312
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:50,337
Get on the ready line! Hurry up!
Move it out, goddammit!

313
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:55,368
Get hot! One, two, three!
Come on, get out, get out, get out!

314
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:59,896
Move it out, move it out, move it out!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

315
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:03,495
Absolutely badasses!

316
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:05,854
Let's pack 'em in! Get in there!

317
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:08,291
All right, people! Move it!

318
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:13,851
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

319
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:18,091
All right, I want combat seating.
You know your places.

320
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,409
Get those weapons stowed! Let's go!

321
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,696
Come on, settle down, people!

322
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:29,138
- Lock 'em in, Hudson.
- Ready to get it on? You know it!

323
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:31,815
OK, Bishop, let's go.

324
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:33,891
Roger.

325
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:38,219
I'm ready, man.

326
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,689
Ready to get it on. Yo!

327
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:49,494
Stand by. Cross-locking now.
Pre-launch auto cycle engaged.

328
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:56,538
Primary couplers released. Hit the internals.

329
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,899
Confirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.

330
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:14,210
Affirmative. All drop stations secured.

331
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:19,218
Stand by. 10 seconds.

332
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:25,850
Stand by to initiate release sequencer.

333
00:39:25,939 --> 00:39:27,452
On my mark. Five...

334
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,134
We're on an express elevator to hell!
Going down!

335
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:34,097
...two, one, mark.

336
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,654
Switch to DCS ranging.

337
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:56,096
- 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.
- We're in the pipe. Five by five.

338
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:09,928
- We're picking up some hull ionization.
- Got it.

339
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:13,170
Rough air ahead. We're in for some chop.

340
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:30,651
How many drops is this for you, Lieutenant?

341
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:32,695
38.

342
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:37,089
- Simulated.
- How many combat drops?

343
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:41,092
Uh... two. Including this one.

344
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:44,376
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

345
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,089
Range zero-one-four.

346
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:01,613
Turning on final.

347
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:09,415
- I got a bad feeling about this drop.
- You always say that, Frost.

348
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,855
- "I got a bad feeling about this drop."
- OK, OK.

349
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:16,727
When we get back without ya,
I'll call your folks.

350
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:22,932
All right. Let's see what we can see.

351
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:25,817
Everybody online. Lookin' good.

352
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:28,970
Drake, check your camera.

353
00:41:31,514 --> 00:41:33,789
That's better. Pan it around a bit.

354
00:41:35,812 --> 00:41:37,928
I'm ready, man. Check it out.

355
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:40,731
<i>I am the ultimate badass.</i>

356
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:43,610
State-of-the-badass-art.

357
00:41:43,692 --> 00:41:46,160
You do not wanna fuck with me.

358
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:49,162
Check it out.

359
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:52,845
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.

360
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:57,767
Me and my squad of ultimate badasses
will protect you.

361
00:41:57,852 --> 00:41:59,968
Check it out.

362
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:03,010
Independently targeting
particle-beam Phalanx.

363
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:07,091
Wham! Fry half a city with this puppy.

364
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:12,087
We got tactical smart missiles,
phased-plasma pulse rifles, RPGs,

365
00:42:12,172 --> 00:42:15,164
we got sonic electronic ballbreakers!

366
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:20,372
- We got nukes, we got knives, sharp sticks...
- Knock it off, Hudson! Gear up.

367
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,130
Two minutes, people. Get hot!
Somebody wake up Hicks.

368
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:43,567
- Coming around for a seven-zero-niner.
- Terminal guidance locked in.

369
00:42:43,648 --> 00:42:45,718
Where's the damn beacon?

370
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:48,003
Oh, I see it.

371
00:42:53,248 --> 00:42:56,365
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- Yup, that's it.

372
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,599
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

373
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:03,283
You know, we manufacture those, by the way.

374
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:17,048
OK, Ferro, take us in low
over the main colony complex.

375
00:43:18,048 --> 00:43:22,087
Storm shutters are sealed.
There's no visible activity.

376
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:24,841
- All right. Hold at 40.
- Roger.

377
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:27,726
Give me a slow circle of the complex.

378
00:43:34,168 --> 00:43:36,477
Structure seems intact.

379
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:42,562
- They still have power.
- OK, Ferro, set down on the landing grid.

380
00:43:42,648 --> 00:43:45,242
Immediate dustoff on my clear.

381
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:01,043
Down and clear.

382
00:44:02,448 --> 00:44:05,246
Ten seconds, people! Look sharp!

383
00:44:07,128 --> 00:44:10,359
All right, I want
a nice clean dispersal this time.

384
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:14,683
Let's go! Move it out!

385
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,759
Head 'em up!

386
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:40,037
First squad up online. Hicks,
get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.

387
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:43,206
Vasquez, take point. Let's move!

388
00:44:50,648 --> 00:44:52,639
Move up.

389
00:44:55,648 --> 00:44:57,639
Hudson, run a bypass.

390
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:05,288
Second squad, move up. Flanking positions.

391
00:45:05,368 --> 00:45:07,928
Second squad online.

392
00:45:34,888 --> 00:45:36,879
Are you set?

393
00:45:39,728 --> 00:45:41,719
Go on.

394
00:46:06,088 --> 00:46:10,957
Second team, move inside.
Hicks, take the upper level.

395
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:40,559
Sir, are you copying this?
Looks like hits from small-arms fire.

396
00:46:40,648 --> 00:46:45,881
Uh, we got some explosives damage.
It's probably seismic survey charges.

397
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:50,405
Are you readin' this?
Keep it tight, people.

398
00:47:02,408 --> 00:47:07,607
All right, Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

399
00:47:23,248 --> 00:47:25,887
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.

400
00:47:32,088 --> 00:47:33,840
Quarter and search by twos.

401
00:47:45,368 --> 00:47:48,041
OK, Dietrich, Frost, you're up.

402
00:48:32,498 --> 00:48:34,295
It's right in there.

403
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:47,816
Now!

404
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:55,408
- Good one, Hudson.
- Sir, we have a negative situation here.

405
00:49:05,602 --> 00:49:07,797
Wait. Wait, tell him to...

406
00:49:08,962 --> 00:49:10,634
Hicks, back up.

407
00:49:10,722 --> 00:49:12,713
Pan right.

408
00:49:13,682 --> 00:49:15,434
There.

409
00:49:16,322 --> 00:49:19,075
You seein' this all right?

410
00:49:19,162 --> 00:49:24,555
Looks melted. Somebody must have bagged
one of Ripley's bad guys here.

411
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:26,394
Acid for blood.

412
00:49:26,482 --> 00:49:29,872
If you like that, you're gonna love this.

413
00:49:42,642 --> 00:49:45,998
- Quit screwin' around.
- Second squad, what's your status?

414
00:49:46,082 --> 00:49:48,960
We've just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.

415
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:51,602
Roger.
Sir, this place is dead.

416
00:49:51,682 --> 00:49:55,277
Whatever happened here, I think we missed it.

417
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:58,638
The area's secured.
Let's see what their computer can tell us.

418
00:49:58,722 --> 00:50:00,917
- It's not secured.
- The area is secured.

419
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:04,597
First team, head for Operations.
Hudson, try to get their CPU online.

420
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:09,334
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

421
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:15,563
- He's comin' in. I feel safer already.
- Pendejojerk-off.

422
00:50:35,131 --> 00:50:38,680
Sir, we got the CPU online. No problem.

423
00:50:38,771 --> 00:50:41,239
Good. Stand by in Operations.

424
00:50:42,611 --> 00:50:44,249
OK, let's go.

425
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,640
Are you all right?

426
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,130
Yes.

427
00:51:24,023 --> 00:51:27,698
Sir. They sealed off this wing at both ends.

428
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:31,935
Welded the doors, and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

429
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:35,015
But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.

430
00:51:35,103 --> 00:51:37,059
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

431
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:41,455
- Last stand.
- Must have been a hell of a fight.

432
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:43,852
Yeah. Looks that way.

433
00:51:45,863 --> 00:51:52,939
All right, Drake, this way. We should be able
to cut through the medlab to Operations.

434
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:42,574
Lieutenant.

435
00:52:44,423 --> 00:52:46,414
Gorman.

436
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:05,536
Are those the same ones?

437
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:18,738
Careful, Burke.

438
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:31,498
Looks like love at first sight to me.

439
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,097
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

440
00:53:34,183 --> 00:53:37,380
Two are alive, the rest are dead.

441
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:41,056
Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

442
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:45,739
Subject: Marachuk, John J.
Died during the procedure.

443
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:47,939
They killed him taking it off.

444
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:51,576
Yo, Hicks.

445
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,051
I think we got something here.

446
00:53:59,463 --> 00:54:02,421
- Behind us.
- One of us?

447
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:05,620
Apone, where are your people?
Anybody in D-Block?

448
00:54:05,703 --> 00:54:09,378
That's a negative. We're all in Operations.

449
00:54:11,463 --> 00:54:13,499
Talk to me, Frosty.

450
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,574
Just keep movin', baby.

451
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:35,093
- It's moving.
- Which way?

452
00:54:35,183 --> 00:54:38,653
It's coming straight for us. Straight up.

453
00:55:14,623 --> 00:55:16,693
- Fuck!
- Hold up.

454
00:55:17,703 --> 00:55:19,182
Ripley?

455
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:41,857
Hey. It's all right.
It's all right. Come on.

456
00:55:41,943 --> 00:55:46,175
- Just grab her, Corporal.
- Don't be afraid. Come on. We won't hurt you.

457
00:55:46,823 --> 00:55:49,781
It's all right. It's OK. Come on out.

458
00:55:49,863 --> 00:55:51,774
Come on. Easy, easy.

459
00:55:51,863 --> 00:55:53,137
I got her!

460
00:55:53,223 --> 00:55:54,622
Ow! Damn!

461
00:55:54,703 --> 00:55:57,376
- Don't let her go!
- She's under the grille.

462
00:55:57,463 --> 00:56:01,775
- Frost, get your light up here.
- Where'd she go?

463
00:56:03,423 --> 00:56:06,096
- Shine the light!
- Down here!

464
00:56:07,143 --> 00:56:09,418
- Here! Here!
- There she is!

465
00:56:09,503 --> 00:56:11,414
Keep back! Don't scare her.

466
00:56:11,503 --> 00:56:14,859
- Grab her, man! We're gonna lose her.
- Damn it!

467
00:56:20,743 --> 00:56:22,734
Wait!

468
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,581
It's OK. It's all right.

469
00:56:51,063 --> 00:56:53,258
Don't be afraid.

470
00:56:54,223 --> 00:56:56,214
See?

471
00:56:56,303 --> 00:56:58,180
Wait! No, you don't!

472
00:56:58,703 --> 00:57:01,900
It's OK. You're gonna be all right now.

473
00:57:04,303 --> 00:57:07,613
Easy, easy. It's gonna be OK.

474
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:10,297
It's all right. You're gonna be OK.

475
00:57:12,343 --> 00:57:14,538
Easy... easy.

476
00:57:50,223 --> 00:57:52,612
- What's her name again?
- Rebecca.

477
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:56,298
Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

478
00:57:56,383 --> 00:57:59,136
Just start at the beginning.

479
00:57:59,223 --> 00:58:01,214
Where are your parents?

480
00:58:02,223 --> 00:58:06,660
- Now look, Rebecca, you have to try...
- Gorman. Give it a rest, why don't you?

481
00:58:10,023 --> 00:58:13,811
- Total brain lock.
- Physically she's OK.

482
00:58:13,903 --> 00:58:16,815
Borderline malnutrition,
but no permanent damage.

483
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:19,576
Come on. We're wasting our time.

484
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:32,735
Try this. It's a little hot chocolate.

485
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:35,860
There you go.

486
00:58:38,823 --> 00:58:40,814
That good, huh?

487
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:48,534
Uh-oh. I made a clean spot here.

488
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:53,617
Now I've done it.
Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.

489
00:59:01,423 --> 00:59:06,213
Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

490
00:59:06,303 --> 00:59:08,692
And a pretty one, too.

491
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,658
You don't talk much, do you?

492
00:59:23,863 --> 00:59:27,742
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Just tell me what you're scanning for.

493
00:59:27,823 --> 00:59:33,659
PDTs. Personal data transmitters. Every
colonist had one surgically implanted.

494
00:59:33,743 --> 00:59:38,942
If they're within 20 klicks
we'll read it out here. So far, zippo.

495
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:44,177
I don't know how you managed to stay alive.
But you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

496
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,941
Newt.

497
00:59:50,223 --> 00:59:52,578
- What'd you say?
- Newt.

498
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,653
My name's Newt.

499
00:59:55,743 --> 00:59:59,702
Nobody calls me Rebecca except my brother.

500
01:00:00,703 --> 01:00:02,421
Newt?

501
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:04,334
I like that.

502
01:00:04,423 --> 01:00:07,335
I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.

503
01:00:10,343 --> 01:00:12,140
And who is this?

504
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,134
Casey.

505
01:00:15,223 --> 01:00:16,542
Hello, Casey.

506
01:00:17,903 --> 01:00:21,612
- What about your brother? What's his name?
- Timmy.

507
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:23,819
Is Timmy around here too,

508
01:00:23,903 --> 01:00:26,371
maybe hiding like you were?

509
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,574
Any sisters?

510
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:37,058
Mom and dad?

511
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:40,460
Newt.

512
01:00:40,543 --> 01:00:42,738
Look at me. Where are they?

513
01:00:42,823 --> 01:00:45,781
They're dead, all right? Can I go now?

514
01:00:48,743 --> 01:00:50,574
I'm sorry, Newt.

515
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:55,178
Don't you think you'd be safer here with us?

516
01:00:57,543 --> 01:01:01,252
These people are here to protect you.
They're soldiers.

517
01:01:01,343 --> 01:01:04,096
It won't make any difference.

518
01:01:17,543 --> 01:01:19,738
Need anything else?

519
01:01:21,423 --> 01:01:25,098
Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?

520
01:01:26,503 --> 01:01:28,494
No.

521
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:34,859
- That's a nice pet you got there, Bishop.
- Magnificent, isn't it?

522
01:01:35,183 --> 01:01:38,892
Yo! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen.

523
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:41,258
- Found 'em.
- They alive?

524
01:01:41,343 --> 01:01:44,335
Unknown. But it looks like all of 'em.

525
01:01:45,183 --> 01:01:50,815
Over at the processing station.
Sub-level 3, under the main cooling towers.

526
01:01:52,103 --> 01:01:56,494
- Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
- Let's saddle up, Apone.

527
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,858
Aye, sir.

528
01:01:58,943 --> 01:02:03,095
Let's go, people. They ain't payin' us
by the hour. Let's go. Head 'em out.

529
01:02:03,183 --> 01:02:05,219
OK, Frost, you're drivin'.

530
01:02:16,543 --> 01:02:19,341
It's OK. Don't worry. It'll be OK.

531
01:02:59,063 --> 01:03:02,897
I want a straight V deployment.
Second team on left flank.

532
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:05,736
Advance on axial six-six-four.

533
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:09,736
Tracker online.
Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient.

534
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:14,578
Hudson, tracker online.
Left and right, little buddy.

535
01:03:14,663 --> 01:03:19,020
40 meters in, bearing two-two-one,
there should be a stairwell.

536
01:03:19,103 --> 01:03:20,821
Check. Got it.

537
01:03:22,343 --> 01:03:24,732
You want sub-level 3.

538
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:30,814
Let's go, people. Hudson, you got the point.
Hicks, watch our tails.

539
01:03:30,903 --> 01:03:33,815
Nice and easy. Check those corners.

540
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:36,898
Check those corners.

541
01:03:39,503 --> 01:03:43,735
- Watch your spacing.
- You heard him. Don't bunch up. Stay loose.

542
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:47,418
Your transmission's
showing a lot of break-up.

543
01:03:47,503 --> 01:03:52,054
- Probably interference from the structure.
- Use those lights.

544
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:56,976
Next one down.
Then proceed on a two-one-six.

545
01:03:57,063 --> 01:03:59,099
Roger. That's a two-one-six.

546
01:04:01,623 --> 01:04:04,501
I'm not making that out too well.
What is it, Hudson?

547
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:07,381
You tell me, man. I only work here.

548
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,541
What is that?

549
01:04:24,743 --> 01:04:26,620
I don't know.

550
01:04:27,623 --> 01:04:29,818
Proceed inside.

551
01:04:44,743 --> 01:04:47,655
Watch your fire
and check your targets.

552
01:04:47,743 --> 01:04:50,974
Remember we're looking for civvies in here.

553
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:01,176
Easy.

554
01:05:01,263 --> 01:05:05,097
Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.

555
01:05:05,183 --> 01:05:07,378
Nice and easy.

556
01:05:09,623 --> 01:05:15,175
- Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
- Yeah... but secreted from what?

557
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,823
Nobody touch nothin'.

558
01:05:18,383 --> 01:05:20,738
Busy little creatures, huh?

559
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:24,978
- Hot as hell in here.
- Yeah, man. But it's a dry heat.

560
01:05:25,063 --> 01:05:27,258
Knock it off, Hudson.

561
01:05:34,783 --> 01:05:37,820
Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?

562
01:05:37,903 --> 01:05:42,135
10mm explosive-tip caseless.
Standard light-armor-piercing round. Why?

563
01:05:42,223 --> 01:05:47,536
Look where your team is. They're
right under the primary heat exchangers.

564
01:05:47,623 --> 01:05:49,261
So?

565
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:54,463
So, if they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

566
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:57,216
- Yeah, she's absolutely right.
- So? So what?

567
01:05:57,743 --> 01:06:03,693
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor. Right?

568
01:06:03,783 --> 01:06:08,254
<i>So you're talking about a thermonuclear
explosion and "Adis, muchachos."</i>

569
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:10,857
Oh, great. Wonderful.

570
01:06:11,703 --> 01:06:13,694
Shit!

571
01:06:15,903 --> 01:06:19,179
Look, uh... Apone?

572
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:22,095
Look...

573
01:06:22,183 --> 01:06:27,382
We can't have any firing in there. I want
you to collect magazines from everybody.

574
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:28,942
Is he fucking crazy?

575
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:31,332
What are we supposed to use?
Harsh language?

576
01:06:31,423 --> 01:06:34,176
- Flame units only. I want rifles slung.
- Sir, I...

577
01:06:34,263 --> 01:06:37,096
Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.

578
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:43,538
All right, sweethearts, you heard the man.
Pull 'em out. Come on, let's have 'em.

579
01:06:43,623 --> 01:06:46,421
Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.

580
01:06:49,383 --> 01:06:51,180
Damn!

581
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:56,178
You too. Give it up, Ski. Come on. Let's go.
Crowe! I want it now. Give it up.

582
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,254
Right on, Vas.

583
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:03,338
Let's go, Marine. Give it up.
Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.

584
01:07:03,423 --> 01:07:06,142
- Thanks a lot, sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

585
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:08,054
Head 'em out, people.

586
01:07:10,303 --> 01:07:13,773
I like to keep this handy...
for close encounters.

587
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,342
I heard that.

588
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:28,501
- Any movement?
- Nothing. Zip.

589
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:43,054
Holy shit.

590
01:07:55,543 --> 01:07:57,693
Newt, go sit up front.

591
01:07:58,503 --> 01:08:00,698
Go on. Now!

592
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:30,900
Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

593
01:08:30,983 --> 01:08:35,579
We're still marines, and we got a job to do.
Keep it movin'.

594
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,574
Easy.

595
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:11,175
Top! Get over here! We got a live one!

596
01:09:11,263 --> 01:09:15,336
- You're gonna be all right.
- Please... kill me.

597
01:09:15,423 --> 01:09:18,062
Just stay calm.
We're gonna get you out of here.

598
01:09:18,143 --> 01:09:19,940
It's gonna be all right.

599
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:22,253
- Oh, man!
- What is it, Dietrich?

600
01:09:22,343 --> 01:09:23,822
Convulsion!

601
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:27,059
Dietrich! Get back! Get back!

602
01:09:34,983 --> 01:09:36,177
No!

603
01:09:36,263 --> 01:09:38,094
- Flame-thrower!
- Kill it!

604
01:09:38,183 --> 01:09:40,743
Get back! Flame-thrower! Move!

605
01:10:10,303 --> 01:10:13,500
- Movement!
- What's the position?

606
01:10:14,183 --> 01:10:17,971
- I can't lock in.
- Talk to me, Hudson!

607
01:10:18,943 --> 01:10:21,980
Multiple signals! They're closing!

608
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,462
Go to infrared, people. Look sharp!

609
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:31,653
- What's happening? We can't see anything.
- Pull your team out, Gorman.

610
01:10:37,223 --> 01:10:40,215
I got signals!
I got readings in front and behind!

611
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:44,137
- Where, man? I don't see shit!
- He's right. There's nothing back here.

612
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:49,820
Look, I'm tellin' ya.
There's somethin' moving, and it ain't us!

613
01:10:49,903 --> 01:10:55,341
Tracker's off-scale, man.
They're all around us, man. Jesus!

614
01:10:55,423 --> 01:10:59,018
Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all.

615
01:11:07,503 --> 01:11:08,697
Frost!

616
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,094
Come on!

617
01:11:22,703 --> 01:11:27,015
- Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on?!
- Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!

618
01:11:27,103 --> 01:11:29,856
Dietrich! Crowe! Sound off!

619
01:11:31,023 --> 01:11:32,820
Frost! Frost!

620
01:11:37,103 --> 01:11:38,855
Wierzbowski!

621
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:40,338
Wierzbowski!

622
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:45,417
Let's rock!

623
01:11:48,063 --> 01:11:49,542
Who's firing? Goddammit!

624
01:11:51,783 --> 01:11:53,933
I ordered a hold fire.

625
01:11:54,023 --> 01:11:58,062
They're coming out of the walls!
They're coming out of the goddamn walls!

626
01:11:58,143 --> 01:12:02,978
Uh... Apone, I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with...

627
01:12:03,063 --> 01:12:05,736
Vasquez! Drake! Hold your fire, goddammit!

628
01:12:05,823 --> 01:12:11,819
Apone, lay down a suppressing fire with
the incinerators and fall back by squads...

629
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:15,100
Say again? All after "incinerators".

630
01:12:15,183 --> 01:12:20,098
I said lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators and fall back...

631
01:12:25,503 --> 01:12:27,698
- Sarge! Sarge!
- Apone...

632
01:12:27,783 --> 01:12:30,013
- Talk to me. Apone?
- Top, you copy?

633
01:12:30,103 --> 01:12:32,253
- Talk to me, Apone!
- He's gone!

634
01:12:33,863 --> 01:12:37,856
- Get them out of there! Do it now!
- Shut up!

635
01:12:37,943 --> 01:12:41,015
- Hicks, whoever's left, get the hell out...
- Just shut up!

636
01:12:43,023 --> 01:12:45,696
Where's Apone?! Where's Apone?!

637
01:12:45,783 --> 01:12:48,855
The sarge is gone!
Let's get the fuck outta here!

638
01:12:48,943 --> 01:12:51,332
Let's go, Marines!

639
01:12:51,423 --> 01:12:54,415
Hudson? Vasquez?

640
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:57,458
- Hudson, look out!
- Get it!

641
01:13:00,503 --> 01:13:02,892
- Hicks!
- Fall back!

642
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:05,338
- I told them to fall back.
- Fall back! Now!

643
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:08,221
- I told them to fall back.
- They're cut off!

644
01:13:08,303 --> 01:13:11,136
- Do something!
- Let's go, Marine!

645
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:15,022
- Come on, keep moving, baby!
- Hold on, Newt.

646
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,693
Ripley, what the hell are you doing?!

647
01:13:29,903 --> 01:13:31,018
Turn it round!

648
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:35,542
That's an order!

649
01:13:39,863 --> 01:13:43,173
- Turn this thing around!
- Get off me, damn it!

650
01:13:43,263 --> 01:13:45,902
You had your chance, Gorman.

651
01:13:57,023 --> 01:13:59,491
- Come on!
- Come on, Vas!

652
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:19,299
Come on, let's move it!

653
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,215
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

654
01:14:22,303 --> 01:14:25,579
It's blocked, man! We've got to go around.

655
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,335
Open the door!
Hicks!

656
01:14:27,423 --> 01:14:30,221
Drake! We are leaving!

657
01:14:30,303 --> 01:14:32,055
Get them, Vas!

658
01:14:33,463 --> 01:14:34,782
Run for it!

659
01:14:36,903 --> 01:14:38,894
Shit!

660
01:14:43,183 --> 01:14:46,380
- Go! Go!
- Drake, come on, man! Come on!

661
01:14:52,503 --> 01:14:54,573
Drake, come on!

662
01:14:59,383 --> 01:15:00,816
No!

663
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:05,537
- Fire in the hold!
- He's gone!

664
01:15:05,623 --> 01:15:09,013
- No! Drake's out there!
- Come on! Put it out!

665
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:12,300
- Drake's coming!
- He's gone!

666
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,975
No, he's not!

667
01:15:16,063 --> 01:15:18,941
Forget him! He's gone!

668
01:15:22,823 --> 01:15:25,018
Get on the goddamn door!

669
01:15:27,943 --> 01:15:30,138
Eat this!

670
01:15:32,983 --> 01:15:35,895
Ripley! Go, go, go!

671
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,902
It's all right! We're clear! Ripley!

672
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:42,453
You've blown the transaxle!
You're just grinding metal!

673
01:16:42,543 --> 01:16:44,659
Come on, ease down!

674
01:16:44,743 --> 01:16:47,735
Ease down. Ease down!

675
01:16:48,983 --> 01:16:50,211
Ease down.

676
01:17:02,023 --> 01:17:04,014
You OK?

677
01:17:04,863 --> 01:17:06,979
I'm all right.

678
01:17:07,063 --> 01:17:09,372
Get away from me, man!

679
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:13,092
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

680
01:17:13,183 --> 01:17:16,175
I don't know. Maybe a concussion.

681
01:17:16,263 --> 01:17:18,299
- But he's alive.
- No, man, he's dead!

682
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:23,901
<i>- Wake up, pendejo! Then I'm gonna kill you!
- Back off... right now.</i>

683
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,174
Somebody get me a first-aid kit.

684
01:17:28,263 --> 01:17:30,458
Hey. Hey, look.

685
01:17:31,223 --> 01:17:36,297
The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Their signs were low, but they ain't dead.

686
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:40,217
- Then we go back in there and get them.
- Fuck that! I ain't going back in there.

687
01:17:40,303 --> 01:17:43,420
You can't help them.

688
01:17:43,503 --> 01:17:49,294
You can't. Right now they're being
cocooned just like the others.

689
01:17:52,183 --> 01:17:56,256
Oh, dear Lord Jesus,
this ain't happenin', man.

690
01:17:56,343 --> 01:17:59,096
This can't be happenin', man.
This isn't happenin'!

691
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,938
All right. We've got seven canisters of CN-20.

692
01:18:03,023 --> 01:18:06,220
I say we roll them in there
and nerve-gas the whole fuckin' nest.

693
01:18:06,303 --> 01:18:09,295
It's worth a try, but we don't know
if it's gonna affect 'em.

694
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:13,262
Let's just bug out and call it even.
What are we talking about this for?

695
01:18:13,343 --> 01:18:17,621
I say we take off
and nuke the entire site from orbit.

696
01:18:19,743 --> 01:18:21,893
It's the only way to be sure.

697
01:18:21,983 --> 01:18:24,497
- Fuckin' A!
- Hold on. Hold on one second.

698
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:28,622
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

699
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:30,694
They can bill me.

700
01:18:31,463 --> 01:18:37,015
OK, look. This is an emotional moment
for all of us, OK? I know that.

701
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:39,617
But let's not make snap judgments, please.

702
01:18:39,703 --> 01:18:42,615
This is clearly
an important species we're dealing with,

703
01:18:42,703 --> 01:18:47,254
and I don't think that you or I or anybody
has the right to arbitrarily exterminate them.

704
01:18:47,343 --> 01:18:49,618
- Wrong.
- Yeah. Watch us.

705
01:18:49,703 --> 01:18:55,175
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on
current events. We just got our asses kicked!

706
01:18:55,263 --> 01:19:00,576
Look, I'm not blind to what's going on,
but I cannot authorize that kind of action.

707
01:19:00,663 --> 01:19:02,654
I'm sorry.

708
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:08,293
Well, I believe Corporal Hicks...
has authority here.

709
01:19:10,263 --> 01:19:11,616
<i>Corporal Hicks is?</i>

710
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:18,381
This operation is under military jurisdiction,
and Hicks is next in chain of command, right?

711
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:20,215
Yeah.

712
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:23,532
Yeah. That's right.

713
01:19:23,623 --> 01:19:28,094
Yeah. Look, Ripley,
this is a multi-million-dollar installation.

714
01:19:28,183 --> 01:19:31,858
He can't make that kind of decision.
He's just a grunt.

715
01:19:31,943 --> 01:19:34,298
- No offence.
- None taken.

716
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:36,339
- Ferro, do you copy?
- Standing by.

717
01:19:36,423 --> 01:19:38,778
Prep for dustoff. We need immediate evac.

718
01:19:38,863 --> 01:19:40,581
Roger. On our way.

719
01:19:40,663 --> 01:19:45,259
I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

720
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:49,289
Let's do it.

721
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:59,806
Yo! Pick it up, Hudson. Pick it up, baby.

722
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:07,648
All right, we'll set him down here.

723
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:16,042
Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.

724
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:24,118
- Hold on a second. There's something...
- Just get up here!

725
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:26,519
I'm in. Ramp closing.

726
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,563
Spunkmeyer?

727
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:50,561
Goddammit.

728
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:54,327
Well, where the f?

729
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:08,721
Run!

730
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:51,399
Well, that's great!
That's just fuckin' great, man!

731
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:56,120
Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We're in some real pretty shit now, man!

732
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:58,326
Are you finished?

733
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:03,121
Are you all right?

734
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:12,042
I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?

735
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:15,088
- I'm sorry, Newt.
- You don't have to be sorry.

736
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:19,766
- It wasn't your fault.
- That's it, man. Game over, man!

737
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:22,569
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?

738
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:25,528
Maybe we could build a fire,
sing a couple of songs, huh?

739
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:28,363
- Why don't we try that?
- We'd better get back.

740
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:33,240
It'll be dark soon,
and they mostly come at night. Mostly.

741
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:51,125
That's everything, right?

742
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:55,806
All right, this is absolutely everything
that we can salvage out of the APC wreckage.

743
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:59,360
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

744
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:01,247
That ain't so good.

745
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:04,208
We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.

746
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:08,282
Don't touch that. Dangerous, honey.

747
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:11,248
- Is that the only flame-thrower?
- It's only half-full.

748
01:23:13,413 --> 01:23:16,086
Got another one that's damaged.

749
01:23:18,178 --> 01:23:19,816
But the good news...

750
01:23:19,898 --> 01:23:22,731
We got four of these robot sentries,

751
01:23:22,818 --> 01:23:25,730
with display and scanners intact.

752
01:23:25,818 --> 01:23:28,855
They really kick ass.
I think they'll come in handy.

753
01:23:28,938 --> 01:23:32,248
How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?

754
01:23:35,498 --> 01:23:37,136
17 days.

755
01:23:39,138 --> 01:23:40,776
17 days?!

756
01:23:40,858 --> 01:23:45,010
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 17 hours.

757
01:23:45,098 --> 01:23:48,090
Those things are gonna come in here
like they did before...

758
01:23:48,178 --> 01:23:50,248
Hudson. Hudson!

759
01:23:51,178 --> 01:23:57,128
This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training. Right?

760
01:24:00,698 --> 01:24:04,373
<i>- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You'd better start dealing with it!</i>

761
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:07,018
Listen to me. Hudson, just deal with it,

762
01:24:07,098 --> 01:24:10,056
because we need you,
and I'm sick of your bullshit.

763
01:24:10,138 --> 01:24:14,336
I want you to get on a terminal
and call up some kind of floor-plan file.

764
01:24:14,418 --> 01:24:18,411
Construction blueprints, anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

765
01:24:18,498 --> 01:24:21,410
- Yeah.
- I need to see air ducts,

766
01:24:21,498 --> 01:24:24,774
I need to see electrical access tunnels,
sub-basements,

767
01:24:24,858 --> 01:24:28,407
every possible way into this complex.

768
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:31,492
- We don't have much time.
- OK.

769
01:24:33,258 --> 01:24:36,807
- OK, I'm on it.
- Hudson! Just relax.

770
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:47,734
I'll be in medlab.
Check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

771
01:24:47,818 --> 01:24:50,207
Fine. You do that.

772
01:24:57,178 --> 01:25:00,250
This service tunnel must be
how they're moving back and forth.

773
01:25:00,338 --> 01:25:07,096
That's right. It leads from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

774
01:25:07,178 --> 01:25:11,569
Come down on that. OK, come over.
Closer... Go back.

775
01:25:11,658 --> 01:25:14,126
OK, punch that in right there.

776
01:25:19,152 --> 01:25:21,063
- No. It's back here.
- OK.

777
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,530
There's a pressure door at this end.

778
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,977
Couldn't we put one of the remote sentry
units in the tunnel, then seal that door?

779
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,177
Yeah, but we gotta figure
on them getting into the complex.

780
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:38,380
That's right. So we repair the barricades
at these two intersections,

781
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:44,535
and weld plate steel over these ducts
here, and here, and here.

782
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:47,532
That way they can only
come at us from these two quarters.

783
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:52,853
Right. Then we put the other sentry units
here and here. Right?

784
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:55,579
- Right.
- Outstanding.

785
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:58,458
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

786
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:02,732
- All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
- Affirmative.

787
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,811
Affirmative.

788
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,572
Do your thing, baby.
Come on, let's get the hell outta here.

789
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:26,414
Hudson here. A and B sentries
are in place and keyed.

790
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,491
Stand by. Arming now.

791
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,573
- Test it, Hudson.
- Do it!

792
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:32,935
Fire in the hole!

793
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:38,374
OK, let's get the hell outta here!

794
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:41,532
We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.

795
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,535
For what it's worth...

796
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:59,130
Here, I want you to put this on.

797
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,651
- What's it for?
- It's a locator.

798
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:06,050
Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex on this.

799
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:10,169
It's just a precaution.

800
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:14,776
- Thanks.
- It doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

801
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:16,452
All right, what's next?

802
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:46,866
Last stop.

803
01:27:50,835 --> 01:27:52,473
Get in.

804
01:27:52,555 --> 01:27:54,546
Scoot down.

805
01:27:55,875 --> 01:28:00,471
That's good. Now, you lie here
and have a nap. You're very tired.

806
01:28:00,555 --> 01:28:03,786
I don't want to sleep. I have scary dreams.

807
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:09,073
I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.

808
01:28:09,155 --> 01:28:11,066
Let's take a look.

809
01:28:11,155 --> 01:28:13,305
No. Nothing bad in there.

810
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:17,468
See? Maybe you could
just try to be like her, hm?

811
01:28:17,555 --> 01:28:22,993
Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams
because she's just a piece of plastic.

812
01:28:23,075 --> 01:28:25,669
Right. I'm sorry, Newt.

813
01:28:32,835 --> 01:28:35,065
There.

814
01:28:35,155 --> 01:28:39,228
My mommy always said
there were no monsters, no real ones.

815
01:28:39,315 --> 01:28:42,785
- But there are.
- Yes, there are, aren't there?

816
01:28:44,829 --> 01:28:47,627
Why do they tell little kids that?

817
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:52,851
Most of the time it's true.

818
01:28:52,937 --> 01:28:56,486
Did one of those things grow inside her?

819
01:28:56,577 --> 01:29:00,172
I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.

820
01:29:01,017 --> 01:29:04,646
Isn't that how babies come?
I mean, people babies?

821
01:29:04,737 --> 01:29:08,366
- They grow inside you.
- No, that's very different.

822
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:13,326
- Did you ever have a baby?
- Yes, I did. I had a little girl.

823
01:29:13,417 --> 01:29:15,294
Where is she?

824
01:29:16,537 --> 01:29:20,450
- She's gone.
- You mean dead.

825
01:29:23,177 --> 01:29:25,407
Here. Take this.

826
01:29:28,468 --> 01:29:30,459
For luck.

827
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:35,459
How's that?

828
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:42,868
- Don't go! Please!
- Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room.

829
01:29:42,948 --> 01:29:45,382
And you see that camera right up there?

830
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:51,464
I can see you right through that camera
all the time to see if you're safe.

831
01:29:53,908 --> 01:29:57,662
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt. I mean that.

832
01:29:59,108 --> 01:30:01,906
- That's a promise.
- You promise?

833
01:30:03,588 --> 01:30:06,978
- I cross my heart.
- And hope to die.

834
01:30:08,388 --> 01:30:11,107
And hope to die.

835
01:30:23,828 --> 01:30:25,978
Now go to sleep.

836
01:30:26,068 --> 01:30:28,024
And don't dream.

837
01:30:32,068 --> 01:30:34,059
Sneak!

838
01:30:42,628 --> 01:30:46,416
The acid oxidizes after the creature's death,
completely neutralizing.

839
01:30:46,508 --> 01:30:49,739
That's very interesting, but it
doesn't really get us anywhere.

840
01:30:49,828 --> 01:30:54,538
I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing
with here. Let's go through it again.

841
01:30:54,628 --> 01:31:00,897
They grab the colonists and they immobilize
them to be hosts for more of these.

842
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:04,617
Which would mean that there would
have to be a lot of these parasites.

843
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:08,621
- One for each colonist. Over 100 at least.
- Yes, that follows.

844
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:11,097
But each of these things
comes from an egg.

845
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:15,939
So who's laying these eggs?

846
01:31:17,797 --> 01:31:21,676
I'm not sure. It must be
something we haven't seen yet.

847
01:31:22,277 --> 01:31:25,952
- Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.
- Bees, man. Bees have hives.

848
01:31:26,037 --> 01:31:30,235
You know what I mean. There's, like,
one female that runs the whole show.

849
01:31:30,317 --> 01:31:33,309
- Yes. The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.

850
01:31:33,397 --> 01:31:37,356
<i>- She's badass, man. I mean big.
- These things ain't ants, estpido.</i>

851
01:31:37,437 --> 01:31:39,428
I know that.

852
01:31:39,517 --> 01:31:42,827
I want these specimens destroyed
when you're finished.

853
01:31:45,037 --> 01:31:47,835
Mr. Burke wants them kept alive.

854
01:31:52,303 --> 01:31:54,658
He was very specific about it.

855
01:31:54,743 --> 01:31:58,782
Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.

856
01:31:58,863 --> 01:32:02,299
If you're smart,
we can both come out of this heroes,

857
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:04,772
and we will be set up for life.

858
01:32:06,143 --> 01:32:08,782
You're crazy, Burke, do you know that?

859
01:32:08,863 --> 01:32:12,936
Do you really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past ICC quarantine?

860
01:32:13,023 --> 01:32:15,617
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

861
01:32:15,703 --> 01:32:18,695
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.

862
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:22,901
Just like they'll know you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.

863
01:32:22,983 --> 01:32:25,622
- Wait a second...
- You sent them to that ship.

864
01:32:25,703 --> 01:32:31,175
I just checked the colony log. Directive
dated 6/12/79, signed Burke, Carter J.

865
01:32:31,263 --> 01:32:34,096
You sent them out there
and you didn't even warn them.

866
01:32:34,183 --> 01:32:36,538
- Why didn't you warn them, Burke?
- OK, look.

867
01:32:36,623 --> 01:32:39,774
What if that ship didn't even exist?
I didn't know.

868
01:32:39,863 --> 01:32:44,459
If I made a major security situation out of it,
everybody steps in, administration steps in,

869
01:32:44,543 --> 01:32:46,898
and there's no exclusive rights for anybody.

870
01:32:46,983 --> 01:32:52,660
So I made a decision, and it was wrong.
It was a bad call, Ripley. It was a bad call.

871
01:32:52,743 --> 01:32:58,295
Bad call? These people are dead, Burke! Don't
you have any idea what you've done here?

872
01:32:58,383 --> 01:33:01,056
I'm gonna make sure
they nail you right to the wall.

873
01:33:01,143 --> 01:33:07,412
You're not gonna sleaze your way
out of this one. Right to the wall.

874
01:33:07,503 --> 01:33:09,300
Ripley...

875
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:14,092
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

876
01:33:15,857 --> 01:33:18,291
I'm happy to disappoint you.

877
01:33:31,537 --> 01:33:35,894
- What is it? What's goin' on?
- They're coming. In the tunnel.

878
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:41,047
Here we go. A and B gun tracking and firing.

879
01:33:41,137 --> 01:33:42,570
Multiple targets.

880
01:33:48,137 --> 01:33:49,968
Look at those ammo counters go.

881
01:33:52,497 --> 01:33:54,533
B gun's down 50 per cent.

882
01:33:55,657 --> 01:33:59,047
Man, it's a shooting gallery down there.

883
01:34:01,617 --> 01:34:03,289
60 rounds left on B.

884
01:34:03,377 --> 01:34:06,414
40... 20... 10.

885
01:34:06,497 --> 01:34:08,647
B gun's dry. 20 on A.

886
01:34:09,857 --> 01:34:11,848
10... 5...

887
01:34:15,977 --> 01:34:20,368
- That's it.
- Jesus! They're wall-to-wall in there.

888
01:34:24,337 --> 01:34:26,805
They're at the pressure door.

889
01:34:28,177 --> 01:34:31,408
- Man, listen to that.
- Bishop here.

890
01:34:31,497 --> 01:34:34,091
- I'm afraid I have some bad news.
- That's a switch.

891
01:34:36,297 --> 01:34:39,095
It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?

892
01:34:40,971 --> 01:34:43,485
That's it. Emergency venting.

893
01:34:43,571 --> 01:34:48,042
That's beautiful, man.
Oh, man. That beats it all.

894
01:34:48,131 --> 01:34:51,760
- How long till it blows?
- Four hours.

895
01:34:51,851 --> 01:34:57,448
With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
equal to about 40 megatons.

896
01:34:57,531 --> 01:35:00,967
- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this!

897
01:35:01,051 --> 01:35:05,681
- Vasquez, close the shutters.
- Why can't we shut it down from here?

898
01:35:05,771 --> 01:35:09,969
I'm sorry. The crash caused too much
damage, and overload was inevitable.

899
01:35:10,051 --> 01:35:14,727
Oh, man! And I was gettin' short.
Four more weeks and out.

900
01:35:14,811 --> 01:35:18,201
- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock!
- Hudson, give us a break!

901
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:20,851
Four more weeks. Oh, man!

902
01:35:20,931 --> 01:35:24,207
<i>We've got to get
the other dropship from the Sulaco.</i>

903
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:26,851
There must be some way
of bringing it down on remote.

904
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:30,321
How?! The transmitter
was on the APC. It's wasted.

905
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:33,960
I don't care how,
but we'd better think of something.

906
01:35:34,051 --> 01:35:36,281
Think of what?! We're fucked! We're doomed!

907
01:35:36,371 --> 01:35:39,090
Shut up!
What about the colony transmitters?

908
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:42,322
- The uplink tower down at the other end.
- No, I checked.

909
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:46,689
The hard wiring between here and there
was damaged. We can't align the dish.

910
01:35:46,771 --> 01:35:49,285
Somebody's gonna have to go out there.

911
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:52,602
Take a portable terminal, go out there,
and patch in manually.

912
01:35:52,691 --> 01:35:56,923
Yeah, sure! With those things runnin' around?
You can count me out!

913
01:35:57,011 --> 01:35:59,764
- I guess we can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

914
01:35:59,851 --> 01:36:01,807
<i>- Why don't you go, man?
- I'll go.</i>

915
01:36:01,891 --> 01:36:04,200
- What?
- I'll go.

916
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:07,328
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship anyway.

917
01:36:07,411 --> 01:36:11,120
Yeah, right, man.
Bishop should go. Good idea!

918
01:36:11,691 --> 01:36:17,163
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

919
01:36:28,131 --> 01:36:29,246
How long?

920
01:36:29,331 --> 01:36:32,846
This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 180 meters.

921
01:36:32,931 --> 01:36:36,526
- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...
- Right.

922
01:36:36,611 --> 01:36:40,570
...an hour to patch in and align the antenna,

923
01:36:40,651 --> 01:36:44,326
30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.

924
01:36:44,411 --> 01:36:46,606
It's gonna be close.

925
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:52,760
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

926
01:36:54,491 --> 01:36:55,890
Watch your fingers.

927
01:37:00,331 --> 01:37:02,526
<i>Vaya con Dios, man.</i>

928
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:15,235
This is unbelievable.

929
01:37:15,319 --> 01:37:17,787
20 meters and closing.

930
01:37:17,879 --> 01:37:19,710
- 15.
- How many?

931
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:22,275
Can't tell. Lots.

932
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:25,914
D gun's down 50 per cent.

933
01:37:28,839 --> 01:37:30,875
C gun's right behind it.

934
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:36,791
It ain't stoppin' em.
This thing ain't stoppin' em.

935
01:37:37,079 --> 01:37:39,991
- 150 rounds on D.
- Come on. Come on, baby!

936
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:42,229
- Come on!
- 100 rounds.

937
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,598
Come on, come on!

938
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:52,836
D gun's down to 20.

939
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:56,430
10.

940
01:37:57,519 --> 01:37:58,918
Damn it!

941
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:03,309
Wait! They're retreating.

942
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:10,953
The guns stopped them.

943
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,598
You're right.

944
01:38:21,759 --> 01:38:25,832
- Next time they walk right up and knock.
- Yeah, but they don't know that.

945
01:38:25,919 --> 01:38:29,753
They're probably looking
for other ways to get in.

946
01:38:29,839 --> 01:38:32,831
- That'll take 'em a while.
- Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

947
01:38:32,919 --> 01:38:37,197
- Shut up!
- I want you two walking perimeter.

948
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,710
Move!

949
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,348
Hey, listen.

950
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:53,157
We're all strung-out.
But stay frosty, and alert.

951
01:38:57,088 --> 01:38:59,921
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

952
01:39:00,008 --> 01:39:02,806
<i>All right. Vmonos.</i>

953
01:39:12,248 --> 01:39:14,887
How long's it been since you got any sleep?

954
01:39:14,968 --> 01:39:16,799
24 hours?

955
01:39:17,808 --> 01:39:23,565
Hicks, I'm not gonna end up like those others.
You'll take care of it, won't you?

956
01:39:25,128 --> 01:39:27,358
If it comes to that...

957
01:39:28,088 --> 01:39:30,079
I'll do us both.

958
01:39:31,088 --> 01:39:35,400
Listen, let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that. All right?

959
01:39:35,488 --> 01:39:37,285
All right.

960
01:39:37,888 --> 01:39:42,439
Hey, I wanna introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

961
01:39:42,528 --> 01:39:44,917
This is an M41-A pulse rifle,

962
01:39:45,008 --> 01:39:50,605
10mm, with an over-and-under
30mm pump-action grenade launcher.

963
01:39:50,688 --> 01:39:52,883
Feel the weight.

964
01:39:58,568 --> 01:40:00,763
OK. What do I do?

965
01:40:05,928 --> 01:40:08,601
- OK. Pull it in tight here.
- Right.

966
01:40:09,608 --> 01:40:13,521
Lean into it.
Now, it will kick some.

967
01:40:13,608 --> 01:40:17,123
Right. When the counter reads zero here...

968
01:40:17,208 --> 01:40:19,881
- I press this up?
- That's right.

969
01:40:21,488 --> 01:40:24,924
And get another one in quick.
Slap it in hard.

970
01:40:25,008 --> 01:40:27,522
- Right.
- Now you're ready to rock 'n' roll.

971
01:40:27,608 --> 01:40:30,486
- What's this?
- That's the grenade launcher.

972
01:40:30,568 --> 01:40:34,322
- I don't think you wanna mess with that.
- You started this.

973
01:40:34,408 --> 01:40:36,717
Show me everything.

974
01:40:36,808 --> 01:40:39,003
I can handle myself.

975
01:40:40,448 --> 01:40:42,006
Yeah, I noticed.

976
01:40:51,848 --> 01:40:55,397
- How do you feel?
- All right, I guess.

977
01:40:55,488 --> 01:40:57,638
One hell of a hangover.

978
01:40:58,648 --> 01:41:03,039
- Look, Ripley, I just want...
- Forget it. Excuse me.

979
01:41:56,968 --> 01:41:59,926
It's OK. It's OK.

980
01:43:07,608 --> 01:43:09,599
Newt.

981
01:43:09,688 --> 01:43:11,485
- Wake up.
- Wha?

982
01:43:11,568 --> 01:43:13,843
Be quiet. We're in trouble.

983
01:43:34,408 --> 01:43:36,603
Move, Newt!

984
01:44:06,648 --> 01:44:08,479
Help!

985
01:44:08,648 --> 01:44:10,639
Help!

986
01:44:10,848 --> 01:44:12,361
Hicks!

987
01:44:12,448 --> 01:44:17,363
Say again, Bishop. You've got it into
auto refuel mode, and it's sequencing right?

988
01:44:17,448 --> 01:44:21,487
- That's right.
- OK. Good. Stay on it.

989
01:44:21,568 --> 01:44:26,039
Get back to me when
you've activated the launch cycle.

990
01:44:26,128 --> 01:44:29,325
- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.

991
01:44:31,888 --> 01:44:35,244
- Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!
- Help! Help!

992
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,841
Hicks! Help us!

993
01:44:36,928 --> 01:44:38,964
Break the glass!

994
01:44:39,048 --> 01:44:40,959
Break it! Break it!

995
01:44:41,048 --> 01:44:43,039
I'll try.

996
01:45:02,128 --> 01:45:04,688
Ripley, I'm scared.

997
01:45:05,488 --> 01:45:07,479
Me too.

998
01:45:12,168 --> 01:45:13,840
Stay here.

999
01:45:25,968 --> 01:45:29,199
- It's the medlab.
- Hudson! Vasquez!

1000
01:45:29,288 --> 01:45:33,327
- Meet me in the medlab. We got a fire!
- We're on our way.

1001
01:45:36,088 --> 01:45:38,283
They're coming, Newt.

1002
01:46:09,248 --> 01:46:11,239
Shoot it out!

1003
01:46:15,088 --> 01:46:16,919
- Hudson!
- Jesus!

1004
01:46:20,328 --> 01:46:22,717
Christ, kid! Look out!

1005
01:46:42,528 --> 01:46:45,645
- Over there! Ready?
- Yeah!

1006
01:46:50,368 --> 01:46:52,598
- Hudson?
- Yeah, all clear.

1007
01:46:52,688 --> 01:46:56,317
Nailed the other one. It's history, man.

1008
01:46:56,408 --> 01:46:58,080
Jesus!

1009
01:46:59,088 --> 01:47:02,080
Burke... It was Burke.

1010
01:47:04,888 --> 01:47:07,766
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now!

1011
01:47:07,848 --> 01:47:11,124
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

1012
01:47:13,488 --> 01:47:17,401
He figured that he could get
an alien back through quarantine

1013
01:47:17,488 --> 01:47:20,241
if one of us was impregnated...

1014
01:47:21,248 --> 01:47:23,478
whatever you call it,

1015
01:47:23,568 --> 01:47:26,207
and then frozen for the trip home.

1016
01:47:26,968 --> 01:47:31,325
Nobody would know
about the embryos we were carrying.

1017
01:47:31,408 --> 01:47:33,842
Me and Newt.

1018
01:47:33,928 --> 01:47:37,887
- Wait a minute, now. We'd all know.
- Yes. The only way he could do it

1019
01:47:37,968 --> 01:47:41,677
is if he sabotaged
certain freezers on the way home.

1020
01:47:41,768 --> 01:47:44,202
Namely yours.

1021
01:47:44,288 --> 01:47:47,917
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

1022
01:47:48,008 --> 01:47:50,442
Fuck! He's dead.

1023
01:47:50,968 --> 01:47:53,198
You're dogmeat, pal!

1024
01:47:54,208 --> 01:47:58,884
This is so... nuts. I mean, listen...
listen to what you're saying.

1025
01:47:58,968 --> 01:48:02,438
It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.

1026
01:48:04,648 --> 01:48:09,085
- It's pathetic.
- Burke, I don't know which species is worse.

1027
01:48:09,168 --> 01:48:13,446
You don't see them fucking each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

1028
01:48:13,528 --> 01:48:15,519
All right, we waste him. No offence.

1029
01:48:15,608 --> 01:48:17,564
No! He's gotta go back!

1030
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:23,526
<i>- They cut the power.
- How could they cut it? They're animals!</i>

1031
01:48:23,608 --> 01:48:26,361
I want you two with trackers,
checking the corridors!

1032
01:48:26,448 --> 01:48:30,282
- Gorman, watch Burke! Newt, stay close!
- I got him.

1033
01:48:33,448 --> 01:48:36,520
- I'll go this side.
- You do that, man.

1034
01:49:00,088 --> 01:49:02,079
- Anything?
- Somethin'.

1035
01:49:03,528 --> 01:49:07,203
- It's inside the complex.
- You're just reading me.

1036
01:49:08,648 --> 01:49:10,843
No, no. It ain't you.

1037
01:49:11,888 --> 01:49:15,437
They're inside. Inside the perimeter.
They're in here.

1038
01:49:15,528 --> 01:49:18,725
Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?

1039
01:49:25,488 --> 01:49:27,046
Hudson may be right.

1040
01:49:27,568 --> 01:49:30,082
- Get back, both of you!
- The signal's weird.

1041
01:49:31,328 --> 01:49:35,879
Must be some interference or somethin'.
There's movement all over the place!

1042
01:49:35,968 --> 01:49:38,482
Get back to Operations!

1043
01:49:38,568 --> 01:49:40,479
- It's game time.
- Newt?

1044
01:49:43,008 --> 01:49:45,124
Seal the door.

1045
01:49:45,208 --> 01:49:47,403
- Hurry!
- Come on, come on!

1046
01:49:47,488 --> 01:49:50,127
Come on, get back! Work fast!

1047
01:49:54,728 --> 01:49:57,367
Cover your eyes, Newt. Don't look at the light.

1048
01:49:57,448 --> 01:50:00,087
Movement. Signal's clean.

1049
01:50:00,168 --> 01:50:02,159
Range 20 meters.

1050
01:50:02,248 --> 01:50:04,443
They've found a way in.
Something we missed.

1051
01:50:04,528 --> 01:50:06,325
We didn't miss anything.

1052
01:50:06,408 --> 01:50:08,046
18.

1053
01:50:08,968 --> 01:50:12,847
- 17 meters.
- Something under the floor, not in the plans.

1054
01:50:12,928 --> 01:50:14,520
- 15 meters.
- Ripley!

1055
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:17,918
- Definitely inside the barricades.
- Let's go!

1056
01:50:19,488 --> 01:50:22,127
- 13 meters.
- That's right outside the door. Get back!

1057
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:25,757
- Man, this is a big fucking signal.
- How you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me!

1058
01:50:25,848 --> 01:50:27,122
Almost there.

1059
01:50:28,648 --> 01:50:30,127
That's it!

1060
01:50:31,008 --> 01:50:32,999
12 meters.

1061
01:50:33,088 --> 01:50:34,441
11...

1062
01:50:35,448 --> 01:50:37,598
- 10...
- Then they're right on us.

1063
01:50:37,688 --> 01:50:40,839
- Nine meters.
- Remember, short controlled bursts.

1064
01:50:40,928 --> 01:50:42,202
Eight meters.

1065
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,526
Seven.

1066
01:50:47,688 --> 01:50:50,486
- Six.
- Can't be. That's inside the room.

1067
01:50:50,568 --> 01:50:55,881
- It's readin' right, man! Look!
- Well, you're not reading it right.

1068
01:50:55,968 --> 01:50:58,801
Five meters, man. Four...

1069
01:50:58,888 --> 01:51:00,879
What the hell?!

1070
01:51:03,488 --> 01:51:06,400
- Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus!
- Give me the light.

1071
01:51:24,208 --> 01:51:26,517
There they go! Over there! Get 'em!

1072
01:51:28,128 --> 01:51:30,198
Come on! Come on!

1073
01:51:31,208 --> 01:51:33,517
Do something, Gorman!

1074
01:51:35,048 --> 01:51:38,040
Look out! Look out, there's more of 'em!

1075
01:51:38,128 --> 01:51:41,325
Medical! Get to Medical! Do it!

1076
01:51:41,768 --> 01:51:43,963
- Now!
- Look out, Hudson! Look out!

1077
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,317
Now!

1078
01:51:52,288 --> 01:51:54,006
Burke!

1079
01:51:56,088 --> 01:51:59,125
Open this door! Burke! Open it!

1080
01:52:01,968 --> 01:52:04,562
Come on, let's go! Fall back!

1081
01:52:08,888 --> 01:52:10,241
Die, motherfucker!

1082
01:52:10,848 --> 01:52:11,598
Burke!

1083
01:52:12,448 --> 01:52:15,121
Hudson! Hudson!

1084
01:52:15,208 --> 01:52:19,679
Motherfucker! Come on! Come on!
Come and get it, baby!

1085
01:52:19,768 --> 01:52:23,841
I've got all day! Come on!
Come on, you bastards!

1086
01:52:23,928 --> 01:52:27,887
Come on, you too!
You want some of this? Fuck you!

1087
01:52:29,488 --> 01:52:31,080
Fuck you!

1088
01:52:31,168 --> 01:52:33,682
- Hicks! Hicks!
- Hudson!

1089
01:52:43,128 --> 01:52:45,562
Come on, Hicks! Go!

1090
01:52:45,648 --> 01:52:47,559
It's locked!

1091
01:53:04,408 --> 01:53:06,524
Got it! Let's go!

1092
01:53:06,608 --> 01:53:08,564
- Let's go!
- Go! Go!

1093
01:53:10,048 --> 01:53:11,527
Move, Gorman!

1094
01:53:11,608 --> 01:53:13,963
Seal it!

1095
01:53:14,608 --> 01:53:17,600
Burke! Goddamn you, open this door!

1096
01:53:29,648 --> 01:53:31,047
- Get back!
- Hurry up!

1097
01:53:31,128 --> 01:53:33,642
- Gorman, get out of the way!
- Ripley! This way!

1098
01:53:33,728 --> 01:53:35,366
What?

1099
01:53:36,368 --> 01:53:41,362
- Wait. Get behind me.
- Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!

1100
01:53:43,048 --> 01:53:45,323
- Hicks!
- Come on, let's go!

1101
01:53:47,048 --> 01:53:48,367
Move!

1102
01:53:54,928 --> 01:53:58,398
- Which way to the landing field from here?
- This way.

1103
01:54:02,808 --> 01:54:05,527
Go right!

1104
01:54:07,848 --> 01:54:09,566
This way! This way.

1105
01:54:18,488 --> 01:54:21,207
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

1106
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:24,719
Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.

1107
01:54:24,808 --> 01:54:26,605
The ship is on its way.

1108
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:29,600
ETA 16 minutes.

1109
01:54:29,688 --> 01:54:32,361
Good. Stand by there. We're on our way.

1110
01:54:43,528 --> 01:54:46,918
- Which way now?
- That way. No, wait. This way.

1111
01:54:47,008 --> 01:54:48,077
You sure?

1112
01:54:49,568 --> 01:54:51,047
Vasquez! Move!

1113
01:54:54,928 --> 01:54:57,806
- Right up here! It's just up here.
- Hicks!

1114
01:54:57,888 --> 01:55:00,880
- We're almost there!
- Newt! Wait!

1115
01:55:01,848 --> 01:55:02,917
Newt!

1116
01:55:26,608 --> 01:55:27,882
Vasquez!

1117
01:55:29,568 --> 01:55:31,559
Go!

1118
01:55:33,128 --> 01:55:34,607
Oh, no!

1119
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:50,960
- Newt!
- Up there. There's a shortcut across the roof.

1120
01:55:52,488 --> 01:55:54,479
Hicks!

1121
01:56:02,048 --> 01:56:05,358
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

1122
01:56:21,728 --> 01:56:22,922
Newt!

1123
01:56:23,008 --> 01:56:25,158
- Ripley!
- Newt!

1124
01:56:26,168 --> 01:56:29,205
Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!

1125
01:56:33,968 --> 01:56:35,845
- Hold on, Newt!
- I'm slipping!

1126
01:56:35,928 --> 01:56:37,998
- Don't let go!
- Ripley!

1127
01:56:38,088 --> 01:56:40,044
- Hold on!
- Help!

1128
01:56:40,128 --> 01:56:41,880
Got ya!

1129
01:56:41,968 --> 01:56:43,606
I got ya.

1130
01:56:46,488 --> 01:56:49,082
Newt! No!

1131
01:56:52,248 --> 01:56:55,046
Come on! We can find her with this!

1132
01:56:55,408 --> 01:56:57,205
Stay where you are, Newt!

1133
01:56:57,288 --> 01:56:59,404
- Ripley!
- We're coming!

1134
01:57:10,888 --> 01:57:12,879
Ripley!

1135
01:57:16,568 --> 01:57:18,638
This way.

1136
01:57:19,648 --> 01:57:21,400
She's close.

1137
01:57:21,488 --> 01:57:23,126
Newt!

1138
01:57:25,648 --> 01:57:27,525
Ripley!

1139
01:57:27,928 --> 01:57:29,919
Where are you? Can you hear me?

1140
01:57:31,088 --> 01:57:34,000
- Newt!
- Here! I'm here!

1141
01:57:34,088 --> 01:57:35,316
Where?

1142
01:57:39,608 --> 01:57:42,122
Newt, are you OK?

1143
01:57:43,048 --> 01:57:45,801
- We need to cut it.
- Climb down, honey.

1144
01:57:45,888 --> 01:57:48,243
We've gotta cut through.

1145
01:57:56,208 --> 01:57:59,484
Newt? Don't move. Stay very still.

1146
01:58:00,488 --> 01:58:02,206
OK.

1147
01:58:02,288 --> 01:58:04,882
We're almost there. Hang in there, OK?

1148
01:58:11,648 --> 01:58:13,445
- Hicks! Hurry!
- I know.

1149
01:58:13,528 --> 01:58:14,961
- I know!
- I mean it!

1150
01:58:28,968 --> 01:58:31,562
Newt! Newt, just stay still!

1151
01:58:36,488 --> 01:58:38,683
- Almost there!
- No!

1152
01:58:40,488 --> 01:58:42,479
Newt!

1153
01:58:52,848 --> 01:58:54,884
No! No!

1154
01:58:55,728 --> 01:58:57,719
- Let's go!
- No!

1155
01:58:57,808 --> 01:59:01,084
They don't kill you!
They don't kill you, they...

1156
01:59:01,168 --> 01:59:03,887
- She's alive! She's alive!
- All right!

1157
01:59:03,968 --> 01:59:07,961
I believe you! She's alive!
We've gotta go! Now!

1158
01:59:37,608 --> 01:59:40,361
- Hicks!
- Get it off!

1159
01:59:51,688 --> 01:59:53,485
Here!

1160
01:59:57,608 --> 01:59:59,599
Go!

1161
02:00:01,808 --> 02:00:04,163
Come on! You can make it!

1162
02:00:27,008 --> 02:00:29,647
Bishop! How much time?

1163
02:00:29,728 --> 02:00:32,561
- Plenty. 26 minutes.
- We're not leaving!

1164
02:00:32,648 --> 02:00:34,718
We're not?

1165
02:01:55,568 --> 02:01:56,398
Ripley?

1166
02:01:56,488 --> 02:01:59,924
I don't wanna hear it, Bishop.
She's alive. There's still time.

1167
02:02:02,129 --> 02:02:04,927
- Hicks, don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

1168
02:02:08,681 --> 02:02:11,115
- See you, Hicks.
- Dwayne.

1169
02:02:12,561 --> 02:02:13,880
It's Dwayne.

1170
02:02:15,681 --> 02:02:17,399
Ellen.

1171
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:20,954
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

1172
02:02:28,761 --> 02:02:31,559
Attention.
All personnel must evacuate.

1173
02:02:35,201 --> 02:02:39,956
You now have 15 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

1174
02:03:24,881 --> 02:03:27,520
Attention. Emergency.

1175
02:03:27,601 --> 02:03:31,674
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1176
02:03:31,761 --> 02:03:36,960
You now have 14 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

1177
02:07:08,601 --> 02:07:10,512
Ripley! Ripley!

1178
02:07:26,321 --> 02:07:29,597
Grab on to me! Hold on!

1179
02:11:11,778 --> 02:11:13,131
Let's go!

1180
02:11:16,458 --> 02:11:18,335
Behind us!

1181
02:12:06,938 --> 02:12:08,735
Attention. Emergency.

1182
02:12:09,738 --> 02:12:12,889
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1183
02:12:14,418 --> 02:12:16,807
Attention. Emergency.

1184
02:12:17,618 --> 02:12:21,816
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1185
02:12:21,898 --> 02:12:26,733
You now have four minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

1186
02:12:41,858 --> 02:12:44,452
Come on, goddammit!

1187
02:12:50,298 --> 02:12:52,892
Hold on to me!

1188
02:13:38,418 --> 02:13:41,091
Attention. Emergency.

1189
02:13:41,178 --> 02:13:45,330
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

1190
02:13:45,418 --> 02:13:49,969
You now have two minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

1191
02:13:58,178 --> 02:14:00,169
No!

1192
02:14:02,098 --> 02:14:04,851
Bishop! Goddamn you!

1193
02:15:06,058 --> 02:15:08,049
Close your eyes, baby.

1194
02:15:10,298 --> 02:15:12,414
Look!

1195
02:15:19,138 --> 02:15:20,935
Come on! Come on!

1196
02:15:48,578 --> 02:15:50,694
Punch it, Bishop!

1197
02:16:34,538 --> 02:16:36,529
It's OK. We're OK.

1198
02:16:48,658 --> 02:16:50,808
We made it.

1199
02:16:50,898 --> 02:16:53,093
I knew you'd come.

1200
02:17:07,418 --> 02:17:12,731
He's gonna be all right. He's just out.
I had to give him another shot for the pain.

1201
02:17:12,818 --> 02:17:16,606
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to Medical.

1202
02:17:22,818 --> 02:17:26,527
I'm sorry if I scared you. That platform
was just becoming too unstable.

1203
02:17:26,618 --> 02:17:29,451
I had to hope
things didn't get too rough to take you off.

1204
02:17:29,538 --> 02:17:31,210
Bishop?

1205
02:17:32,218 --> 02:17:34,732
- You did OK.
- I did?

1206
02:17:34,818 --> 02:17:36,046
Oh, yeah.

1207
02:18:14,138 --> 02:18:15,969
Go! Move!

1208
02:18:18,578 --> 02:18:21,376
No! Here! Here!

1209
02:18:22,778 --> 02:18:24,097
Run!

1210
02:18:28,418 --> 02:18:29,976
Here!

1211
02:19:55,138 --> 02:19:57,254
Get away from her, you bitch!

1212
02:20:19,418 --> 02:20:21,852
Come on! Come on!

1213
02:21:46,658 --> 02:21:49,047
Ripley!

1214
02:22:57,338 --> 02:22:58,407
Bishop!

1215
02:23:44,498 --> 02:23:46,693
- Mommy!
- Oh, God!

1216
02:23:50,138 --> 02:23:53,210
Not bad for a human.

1217
02:24:38,538 --> 02:24:41,291
Are we gonna sleep all the way home?

1218
02:24:41,658 --> 02:24:44,252
- All the way home.
- Can I dream?

1219
02:24:46,298 --> 02:24:48,971
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

1220
02:24:57,111 --> 02:24:59,261
- Sleep tight.
- Affirmative.
