00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,996
INDY: Well, it's sandstone.
Christian symbol.

168
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,415
Early Latin text.

169
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,750
Mid-12th century, I should think.

170
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,669
That was our assessment, as well.

171
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,837
Where did this come from?

172
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,881
My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara

173
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,175
while excavating for copper.

174
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,761
Can you translate the inscription?

175
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,723
(READING LATIN)

176
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,560
"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

177
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,605
"will have a spring inside him

178
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,566
"welling up for eternal life.

179
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,320
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

180
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,530
"in the place where you dwell.

181
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,533
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

182
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,037
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

183
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,582
"to the temple where the cup that...

184
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:53,089
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."

185
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,260
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

186
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,806
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

187
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,644
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

188
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,647
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

189
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,483
The Arthur legend.

190
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,985
I've heard this bedtime story before.

191
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,862
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

192
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,698
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.

193
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,159
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

194
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,494
An old man's dream.

195
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,039
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

196
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,170
Grail lore is his hobby.

197
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,838
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

198
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,757
The one the students hope
they don't get.

199
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,219
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

200
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,429
DONOVAN: Be along in a moment, dear.

201
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,728
Hard to resist, isn't it?

202
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,399
The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.

203
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,317
What good is it?

204
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,196
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

205
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,698
It's pretty vague.

206
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,408
Where do you want to start looking?

207
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,827
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

208
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,537
but the entire top portion is missing.

209
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,957
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.

210
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,921
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

211
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,049
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

212
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,010
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

213
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,848
before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.

214
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,391
Three brothers, to be exact.

215
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,476
I've heard this one, as well.

216
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,603
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

217
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,732
150 years after having found the Grail

218
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,859
and began the long journey
back to France,

219
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,986
but only one of them made it.

220
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,448
And before dying of extreme old age,

221
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:46,161
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.

222
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,997
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

223
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:54,127
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

224
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,172
It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,

225
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,048
but the knight promised
that two markers

226
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,675
that had been left behind would.

227
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,387
This tablet is one of those markers.

228
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,681
It proves the knight's story is true.

229
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,350
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

230
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,395
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

231
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,565
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

232
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,318
within the city of Venice, Italy.

233
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,781
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

234
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,867
we're about to complete a great quest

235
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,995
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

236
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,456
We're only one step away.

237
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,709
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

238
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,420
You could be more right than you know.

239
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,797
Yes?

240
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,715
We've hit a snag.

241
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,762
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

242
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,349
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

243
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,144
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

244
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,898
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

245
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,068
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

246
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,405
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

247
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,201
Why don't you try my father?

248
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,078
We already have.

249
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,122
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

250
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,011
BRODY: Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

251
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,304
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

252
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,098
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

253
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,183
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

254
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,393
Dad?

255
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,603
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

256
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,771
Dad?

257
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,439
Dad?

258
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,191
Dear God.

259
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,322
BRODY: What has the old fool
got himself into now?

260
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,410
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

261
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,161
Dad?

262
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,498
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

263
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,168
Mail.

264
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,462
That's it, Marcus.

265
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,425
Venice, Italy.

266
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,138
BRODY: What is it?

267
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,310
INDY: It's Dad's Grail diary.

268
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,315
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

269
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,901
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

270
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,571
This is his whole life.

271
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,657
Why would he have sent this to me?

272
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,159
I don't know,

273
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,870
but someone must want it pretty badly.

274
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,924
Do you believe, Marcus?

275
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,813
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

276
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,778
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

277
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,864
But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.

278
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,452
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

279
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,542
Call Donovan, Marcus.

280
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,545
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.

281
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,216
I'll tell him we'll take two.

282
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,974
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.

283
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,017
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

284
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,519
- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.

285
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,645
It's at your disposal.

286
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,647
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

287
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,068
Dr. Jones, good luck.

288
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,905
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

289
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,025
Signora? Signorina?

290
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,452
- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.

291
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,622
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

292
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,751
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

293
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,169
WOMAN: Dr. Jones?

294
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,963
INDY: Yes?

295
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,299
I knew it was you.

296
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,135
You have your father's eyes.

297
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,432
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

298
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,685
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

299
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,688
- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.

300
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,523
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

301
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,775
How do you do?

302
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,653
ELSA: The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

303
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,239
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

304
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,200
(LAUGHS) I've never seen him
so excited.

305
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,619
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

306
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,704
INDY: Who? Attila the Professor?

307
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,957
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

308
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,668
Frulein, will you permit me?

309
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,754
- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.

310
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,256
- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.

311
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,675
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

312
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

313
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,179
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

314
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,223
Yes. I have something to show you.

315
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,100
I left your father working in the library.

316
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,269
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

317
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,189
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

318
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,775
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

319
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,859
Roman numerals.

320
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,237
ELSA: Here is the library.

321
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,240
INDY: That doesn't look
much like a library.

322
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,450
BRODY: Looks like a converted church.

323
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,619
In this case, it's the literal truth.

324
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,454
We are on holy ground.

325
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,166
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

326
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,545
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

327
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,506
Now, please excuse me.

328
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,299
The library's closing in a few moments.

329
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,344
I'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

330
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,559
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

331
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,643
Where?

332
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,895
Right here, in Dad's diary.

333
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,655
INDY: You see?

334
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,533
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

335
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,286
Dad was onto something here.

336
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,204
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

337
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,248
but we still don't know what they mean.

338
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,833
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

339
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,627
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

340
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,920
Find something?

341
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,006
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

342
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,592
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

343
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,260
My God, I must be blind.

344
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,513
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

345
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,557
he was looking for the tomb itself.

346
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,975
Don't you get it?

347
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,019
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

348
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,021
You said yourself it used to be a church.

349
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,230
Look.

350
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,690
Three.

351
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,194
Three.

352
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,737
Seven.

353
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,363
Seven. Ten.

354
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,283
And ten.

355
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,160
Now where's the ten?

356
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,788
Look around for the ten.

357
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,591
INDY: Three and seven.

358
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,760
Seven and seven

359
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:42,803
and ten.

360
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,492
Ten.

361
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,329
"X" marks the spot.

You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.

365

You're a great deal like your father.

366
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,976
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

367
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,561
Lower me down.

368
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,032
Look after this for me, will you?

00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,599
Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.

371
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,767
Right.

372
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,311
600 years before the Crusades.

373
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,897
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

374
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,191
and burial chambers centuries later.

375
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,233
INDY: That's right.

376
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,861
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

that's where we'll find him.

- Pretty sure.

Watch out.

00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,769
It's petroleum.

384
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,689
I should sink a well down here
and retire.

385

Look.

396
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:01,015
The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.

397
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,352
The shield is the second marker.

What's that?

of the Grail tablet.

Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.

Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?

He never would have
made it past the rats.

Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

Is it for His glory, or for yours?

I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.

It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

The knights of the First Crusade

455

laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said,

459
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,333
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."

But where exactly?

462
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,634
Your father would know.

463
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,556
Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

464
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,225
He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through

465

the whole history of the Grail quest.

A map with no names.

467
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,441
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

468
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,360
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

469
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,279
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

Straight to the canyon.

471
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,241
He knew everything
except where to begin,

472
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,118
the name of the city.

473

Alexandretta.

No. You like the way I do things.

more than he was looking for.

I'm going to continue to do things

00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,119
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

653
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,579
We must have these pages back.

654
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,913
You're wasting your breath.

655
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,790
He won't tell us,

656
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,709
and he doesn't have to.

657
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,337
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

658
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,840
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

659
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,966
HENRY: Marcus?

660
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,427
You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?

661
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,928
He's not up to the challenge.

662
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,472
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

663
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:28,681
We'll find him.

664
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,433
The hell you will.

665
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,185
He's got a two-day head start on you,

666
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,686
which is more than he needs.

667
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,105
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

668
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,273
from here to the Sudan.

669
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,026
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

670
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,944
He'll blend in, disappear.

671
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,863
You'll never see him again.

672
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,532
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

673
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,786
Does anyone here speak English?

674
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:50,953
Or even ancient Greek?

675
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,205
Water? No, thank you, sir.

676
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,623
No. Fish make love in it.

677
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,959
Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.

678
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,211
No, I really don't want...

679
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,463
No, no, thank you very much.

680
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,548
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

681
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,760
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

682
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,303
Mr. Brody!

683
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,554
Sallah. What a relief.

684
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,973
Marcus Brody, sir.

685
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,767
- But where is Indy?
- He's in Austria.

686
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,310
A slight detour.

687
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,436
You are on your own?

688
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,231
Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.

689
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,566
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

690
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,485
Yes, of course.
But where are we going?

691
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,028
This map will show you.

692
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,072
It was drawn by...

693
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,990
Mr. Brody.

694
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:29,909
Welcome to Iskenderun.

695
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,994
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

696
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,204
has sent a car for you.

697
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,581
Well, your servant, sir.

698
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,916
And I am his.

699
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,960
Follow me, please.

700
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,003
My reputation precedes me.

701
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,256
There is no museum in Iskenderun.

702
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,715
Papers, please.

703
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,176
Papers? Of course.

704
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,719
- Run.
- Yes.

705
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,555
Papers. Got it here.

706
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,265
Just finished reading it myself.

707
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,517
- Run.
- Yes.

708
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,519
Egyptian Mail, morning edition. Run.

709
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,812
Did you say...

710
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,355
Run!

711
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,038
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

712

Intolerable.

714
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,561
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.

715
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,438
You must return immediately.

716
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,357
- A rally at the Institute
of Aryan Culture. - So?

717
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:47,612
Your presence on the platform
is requested at the highest level.

718
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,698
Thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at Iskenderun.

719
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,700
Take this diary
to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.

720
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,328
It will show them our progress,
ahead of schedule.

721
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,830
Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.

722
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,165
Let me kill them now.

723
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,333
No.

724
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,251
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

725
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,920
we'll need them alive.

726
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,505
Always do what the doctor orders.

727
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,848
Don't look at me like that.

728
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,517
We both wanted the Grail.

729
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,519
I would have done anything to get it.

730
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,605
You would have done the same.

731
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,607
I'm sorry you think so.

732
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:39,413
I can't forget how wonderful it was.

733
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:40,539
Thank you.

734
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,541
It was rather wonderful.

Let's try and get these ropes loose.

We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

744

You said he had two days' start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.

Are you kidding? I made that up.

746
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,476
You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.

my left jacket pocket?

01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:03,917
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

819
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,794
What final challenge?

820
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,672
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

821
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,382
- Booby traps?
- Oh, yes.

But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

823

so that I wouldn't have to remember.

I was chosen

because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

1224
