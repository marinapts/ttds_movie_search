1
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,367
I dare you to stop me
in my Super Cop Clobberer.

2
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,038
Anybody who'd try to stop him
has to be totally stupid.

3
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:57,042
Stupid? Hey, Mumbly, come back.

4
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,048
And make it snappy.

5
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:22,234
...snow that fell over the whole weekend,
and the blizzard is one of the worst...

6
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,491
...as you can see,
one of the worst in that city's history.

7
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:28,952
They have not been lucky in the Midwest,
as soon as they dig out...

8
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:32,623
...another storm hits and there's one
out west that might be in soon.

9
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:35,751
We've been very lucky, though.
Every time it snows...

10
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,755
- Your friend's out here.
- Friends? I have no friends.

11
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,090
Big Bird, we came to see you drive.

12
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,010
It's a little too late now, isn't it?

13
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,847
Good morning, Louise.

14
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:50,682
He's dead, Chance.

15
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,936
The old man's dead.

16
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,813
I see.

17
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,606
He wasn't breathing...

18
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:00,067
...and he's cold as a fish.

19
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,653
I touched him, just to see.

20
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,448
Chance?

21
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,285
Then I...

22
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:14,959
...covered him up.
Pulled a sheet over his head.

23
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:20,297
Oh, Lord!

24
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:22,842
What a morning.

25
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:28,011
Yes, Louise.
It looks like it's going to snow.

26
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:31,098
Have you seen the garden?

27
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:34,685
- It feels just like it's going to snow...
- Damn it, boy.

28
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,733
Is that all you've got to say?

29
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:44,865
That old man is lying up there
dead as hell...

30
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:48,160
...and it just don't make
any difference to you.

31
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,086
Lord, Chance...

32
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,013
I'm sorry for yelling like I did.

33
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:12,225
No, sir. I just don't know
what I was expecting.

34
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,024
I suppose I better gather you up
some breakfast.

35
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,737
Yes, please. I'm very hungry, Louise.

36
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:30,579
I'll make you some eggs.

37
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:49,012
There're lots of animals in the barnyard.
Want to go with the rooster to see them?

38
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,884
"Sealy Posturepedic morning"

39
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:07,554
Feeling so good it shows.
Because Posturepedic is designed...

40
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,601
...in cooperation with leading orthopedic
surgeons for no morning backache...

41
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:13,936
...from sleeping on a too-soft mattress.

42
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:17,982
"It's a Sealy Posturepedic morning"

43
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:22,236
- Keep in the shade, Alvin.
- Yes, ma 'am.

44
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,156
I won't have the horses
standing in the sun. You hear me?

45
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,784
- Stay in your seat.
- Yes, ma 'am.

46
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,537
- Keep your hat and gloves on.
- Yes, ma 'am.

47
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,873
- And your coat buttoned.
- Yes, ma 'am.

48
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,127
Yes, ma 'am.

49
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:22,799
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,639
Ain't you the gentleman this morning.

51
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm going to go now, Chance.

52
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:33,477
Yes.

53
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,940
You're going to need somebody.

54
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:44,113
You ought to find yourself a lady, Chance.

55
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:49,745
Guess it ought to be an old lady.

56
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,583
You ain't going to do
a young one any good.

57
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:57,253
Not with that little thing of yours.

58
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:03,885
You're always going to be a little boy,
ain't you?

59
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:10,973
Goodbye, Chance.

60
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:20,193
Goodbye, Louise.

61
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,943
- Will you give me a tour?
- Gladly.

62
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:05,783
The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom.
That'll be stop number one.

63
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,830
He and my father used to ride together,
back in the '30s.

64
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:13,332
Before I was born.

65
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,585
You hear that?

66
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,589
It's a new car.

67
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,722
This morning, the President met
in the Oval Office with...

68
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:33,435
...foreign dignitaries and cultural exchange
students from the Republic of China.

69
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:36,522
He presented them with a statue
of the American eagle...

70
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:39,650
...our symbol of peace and freedom
throughout the world.

71
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:43,070
The President warmly encouraged
future trade relations...

72
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:45,906
Why, hello.

73
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,784
We thought we heard something.

74
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:50,619
I'm Thomas Franklin.

75
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:54,748
Hello, Thomas. I'm Chance, the gardener.

76
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:57,045
- The gardener?
- Yes.

77
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,881
Yes, of course.

78
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:03,218
Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.

79
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:05,554
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.

80
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:07,014
Yes.

81
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,349
Yes.

82
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:12,311
We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts.

83
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,145
The law firm handling the estate.

84
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:17,772
Yes, Thomas, I understand.

85
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:24,573
Are you waiting for someone?
An appointment?

86
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:29,077
Yes. Louise will bring me my lunch.

87
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:36,919
All kidding aside, Mr. Chance,
may I ask just what you're doing here?

88
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:39,963
I live here.

89
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:44,051
There is no mention of a gardener.

90
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:49,433
According to our inventories, there hasn't
been a man employed here since 1933.

91
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:53,477
Except for a Mr. Joe Saracini...

92
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:56,230
...a brick mason,
who did some repairs to a wall.

93
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:59,149
He was here for two and a half days
in 1952.

94
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:03,111
Yes. I remember Joe.

95
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:08,575
He was very fat, had short hair...

96
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:12,833
...and showed me pictures
from a funny little book.

97
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,460
- Some pictures?
- Yes.

98
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:17,754
Of men and women.

99
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,639
Just how long have you been living here,
Mr. Chance?

100
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,186
Ever since I can remember.

101
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,815
Ever since I was a child
I've worked in this garden.

102
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,984
Then you really are a gardener?

103
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,611
My roses.

104
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:49,411
We will need some proof
of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.

105
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,457
You have me, I'm here.

106
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,254
That's where Joe fixed the wall.

107
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,511
Are you related to the deceased?

108
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,766
I don't think so.

109
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:22,152
That's a nice car.
Do you drive it, Mr. Chance?

110
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:25,530
I've never been in an automobile.

111
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:27,952
You've never been in a car?

112
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:29,412
No.

113
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:33,208
I've never been allowed
outside of the house.

114
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,545
You can call me Ray,
or you can call me Jay...

115
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,590
I used to listen to the radio.

116
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,968
Then the old man started giving me
television sets.

117
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:47,305
This one has a remote control.

118
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,184
Maybe there's another
gum machine someplace.

119
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:54,356
You see? This is my bed.

120
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,732
This is my bathroom.

121
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,028
This is my sink.

122
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:03,863
This is my toilet.

123
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:06,449
This is my bathtub.

124
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:14,249
Here is my closet.

125
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,839
You have a very handsome wardrobe.

126
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,131
Yes.

127
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:24,302
I'm allowed to go to the attic
and wear any of the old man's clothes.

128
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,972
- They fit me very well, don't they?
- Yes.

129
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:29,891
It's amazing how those clothes
have come back into style.

130
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:31,768
Why is the bed like this?

131
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:36,729
I like to sleep with my head
facing the north.

132
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:38,606
I sleep better that way.

133
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,363
Yes, I've heard about that. Could you
show us something with your address?

134
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:45,741
But this is facing west.

135
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:49,287
- What is facing west?
- The bed.

136
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:56,961
I see.

137
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,009
Mr. Chance, I'd like to know
what sort of claim...

138
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:06,304
...you're planning to make
against the deceased's estate.

139
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,899
The garden is a healthy one, Thomas.

140
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:19,317
I have no claim.

141
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:23,446
I see. Would you be willing
to sign a paper to that effect?

142
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:27,658
I don't know how to sign, Thomas.

143
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:34,834
Very well, Mr. Chance,
I have no alternative but to inform you...

144
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,086
...that this house is now closed.

145
00:16:37,337 --> 00:16:41,424
If, indeed, you have resided here,
you have no legal right to remain.

146
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:46,095
You'll have to move out by,
let's say, noon tomorrow.

147
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:49,265
I don't understand "move out."

148
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,561
Call me, or have your attorney call me...

149
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,272
...if you change your mind about signing.

150
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:01,111
Come on, Sally, let's grab a bite.

151
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:07,993
What about medical records?

152
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:11,205
Could you give us the name
of your doctor or your dentist?

153
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:14,083
I have no doctor or dentist.

154
00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,547
I see.

155
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:21,966
Good day, Mr. Chance.

156
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:25,346
Good day, Sally. Good day, Thomas.

157
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:39,984
Every day you're doing new things,
and you need the Washington Post to help.

158
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:10,183
Pardon me for intruding at a time like this,
but were you very close to Max?

159
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:13,689
Are you kidding? We were inseparable.

160
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,276
Jogger's knee and swimmer's...

161
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:21,945
We have tennis elbow, jogger's knee,
and simmer's...

162
00:18:22,654 --> 00:18:24,156
And swimmer's what?

163
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:27,618
I'm sorry. All I can think of is trunks.

164
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:39,298
Jim 's back was broken in three places,
his skull was fractured...

165
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:42,009
...and his chest crushed. He's a paraplegic.

166
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:44,887
But after a year in the hospital,
he went back to school...

167
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,640
...got his master's degree
and now looks to the future.

168
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,726
I get depressed, you know,
this kind of thing...

169
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:54,146
...and it's momentary,
it usually hits at night.

170
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:30,830
Excuse me.

171
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:34,584
I'm very hungry.
Could you give me some lunch?

172
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:40,757
It's an all-girl show, sir.
It's an all-girl show.

173
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,092
Come right in. It's an all-girl show.

174
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:06,699
Excuse me.

175
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:11,037
Could you please tell me
where I could find a garden to work in?

176
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:13,957
A garden? What are you growing, man?

177
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,546
There is much to be done
during the winter.

178
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,507
I should start the seeds for the spring
and work the soil.

179
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,508
Bullshit!

180
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:22,552
Who sent you here, boy?

181
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:26,222
Did that chicken-shit asshole Raphael
send you, boy?

182
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:28,474
No.

183
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:32,520
Mr. Thomas Franklin told me
I must leave the old man's house.

184
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:35,523
- He's dead, you know.
- Dead, my ass.

185
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:39,612
You tell that asshole,
if he got something to tell me...

186
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:41,990
...to get his ass down here himself.

187
00:23:42,574 --> 00:23:44,031
Got that, boy?

188
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:52,123
TV changer, man.

189
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:56,752
What you got?

190
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:00,548
Now move, honky,
before I cut your white ass.

191
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:04,302
If I see Raphael,
I will give him your message.

192
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:05,972
- Do that.
- Good day.

193
00:24:56,734 --> 00:25:01,113
Excuse me. That tree is very sick.
It needs care.

194
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:06,575
Yes, sir. I'll report it right away.

195
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,910
Thank you.

196
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:10,037
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

197
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:18,587
W-4.

198
00:26:59,944 --> 00:27:03,325
- I'm very sorry, sir, I didn't see you.
- Can't move. My leg.

199
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:06,078
This is terrible, sir.
I hope you're not badly injured.

200
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:09,704
No. I'm not badly injured.
But my leg is very sore.

201
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:12,374
- It's not broken, is it? Can you walk?
- I hope not.

202
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:16,044
- Perhaps I should call an ambulance.
- Let's have a look. Do you mind?

203
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:18,630
- No. I'd like to look.
- What's happened?

204
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,258
My goodness, your leg!

205
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,134
Yes.

206
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:26,181
It should be examined.
We could take you to a hospital.

207
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:29,518
- There's no need for the hospital.
- A doctor should look at that.

208
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:32,020
I insist. We'll take him to a hospital.

209
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:34,606
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Rand.
I never saw the man.

210
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,359
- It's really no one's fault, David.
- Thank you, ma'am.

211
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:49,411
I've never ridden in an automobile before.

212
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:53,458
I assure you, sir,
David is a very careful driver.

213
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:56,670
- I understand.
- Very good.

214
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:19,946
These situations can be so trying.

215
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,825
Everyone seems to make such a to-do
out of a simple little accident.

216
00:28:28,578 --> 00:28:30,580
Is your leg feeling any better?

217
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,540
No, it isn't.

218
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,418
I see.

219
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:41,676
This is just like television,
only you can see much further.

220
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,057
Why don't you come to our house
and we could take care of you there?

221
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,937
Your house?

222
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:55,899
My husband's been very ill. The doctor
and the nurses are staying with us.

223
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:58,109
Hospitals can be so impersonal.

224
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:01,821
- I agree.
- Fine.

225
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:07,079
That'll save a lot of unnecessary fuss and
it'll be that much more pleasant for you.

226
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:09,579
We'll go right on home.

227
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:12,582
And, Jeffery, please call
and tell them we're on our way.

228
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:13,833
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:18,004
Would you care for a drink?

230
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,840
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.

231
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,775
Thank you. May I watch television, please?

232
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,529
Why, yes. Certainly.

233
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,658
And now, the piece of resistance...

234
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:55,167
May I ask your name?

235
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,302
Chance.

236
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:04,888
Chance?

237
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,811
Chance, the gardener.

238
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:17,275
Chauncey Gardiner?
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

239
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,157
Are you related to Basil
and Perdita Gardiner?

240
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:25,827
No, I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.

241
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:28,496
They are such a wonderful couple.

242
00:30:29,331 --> 00:30:31,998
My husband and I
are very good friends of theirs.

243
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,250
We often visit their island.

244
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:36,920
Thank you.

245
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:56,943
Did you lose something?

246
00:30:57,318 --> 00:30:59,820
Yes, I lost my remote control.

247
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:03,157
I use it to change the channels.

248
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:15,211
I'm sorry.

249
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:20,800
You wouldn't think of driving
without your rear-view mirror...

250
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:23,970
...and yet some people still drive
without a fuzz buster.

251
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:56,127
When they unwrapped the chopsticks
to be used by the Chinese guests...

252
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,422
...the packages were clearly stamped
"Made in Taiwan."

253
00:32:00,506 --> 00:32:04,555
I know it's important to stay informed
of all the latest events, but...

254
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,684
...I find there's so much to assimilate
it can become quite muddling.

255
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:12,771
Until they placed the chopsticks around
the table. If the Chinese were upset...

256
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,710
Good evening, ma'am.

257
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:58,380
Wilson, will you take Mr. Gardiner
to the third-floor guest suite?

258
00:33:58,463 --> 00:33:59,423
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:02,342
I'll see you after Dr. Allenby
has a look at your leg.

260
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:04,511
Thank you. Yes.

261
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,038
I've never been in one of these before.

262
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:34,044
It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's been ill.

263
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:37,005
I see.

264
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:42,135
Does it have a television?

265
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:47,724
No. But Mr. Rand does have one
with an electric motor.

266
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,894
That way, he can get around by himself.

267
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,234
How long do we stay in here?

268
00:34:57,901 --> 00:34:58,946
How long?

269
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:02,908
I don't know.
We'll see what the doctor says.

270
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:22,926
I've seen it done before,
in a film on television.

271
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:24,429
This won't hurt at all.

272
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:28,600
It did hurt.

273
00:35:29,184 --> 00:35:33,605
There's no apparent damage to the bone.
But to be sure, we'll do an x-ray.

274
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:35,107
X-ray?

275
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:40,112
By the way, Mr. Gardiner,
I'd like to ask you something straight out.

276
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,989
- Straight out?
- Yes, sir.

277
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,952
Are you planning on making
any sort of claim against the Rands?

278
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:50,625
Claim.

279
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:55,211
That's what Thomas asked me.

280
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,131
Thomas?
You can pull your trousers up now.

281
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:02,218
Who's Thomas?

282
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:05,388
Thomas Franklin. He's an attorney.

283
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:07,265
- An attorney?
- Yes.

284
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:10,810
Then you wish to handle this matter
through your attorneys?

285
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:14,733
There's no need for a claim.

286
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:18,820
I don't even know what they look like.

287
00:36:25,118 --> 00:36:26,286
Well, then.

288
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:29,915
You caught me off guard there,
I must admit.

289
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,500
Thank you.

290
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:37,545
Now, the only thing we have
to look out for is minor hemorrhaging...

291
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,592
...which isn't serious,
but could cause trouble later on.

292
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:42,677
Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...

293
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:46,306
...would it be possible for you
to stay here for a day or two...

294
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:47,849
...so we could keep an eye on it?

295
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:49,893
Yes, I could stay here.

296
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:53,855
- Does this house have a garden?
- Why, yes. Many.

297
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:56,233
Good.

298
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,860
Keep your weight off that leg,
Mr. Gardiner.

299
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:03,698
Mr. Wilson, wheel Mr. Gardiner in
for x-rays after you've finished unpacking.

300
00:37:03,782 --> 00:37:05,370
- Yes, Doctor.
- Thank you.

301
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:13,169
Ever watch a game on TV and see
the players chugging down this stuff?

302
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:14,379
Ever wonder why?

303
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:28,724
I miss you so when I'm out.
How're you feeling?

304
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:31,062
No headaches?

305
00:37:31,437 --> 00:37:33,398
No, it's been a fairly good day.

306
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:38,486
- Better than yours, so I've been told.
- You heard about it?

307
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:41,114
I may be a shut-in, but...

308
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,825
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

309
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:47,203
It was nothing, really.
It just sounded worse than it was.

310
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,582
And Mr. Gardiner is a very reasonable man.

311
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,042
Reasonable...

312
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,671
I'd like to meet a reasonable man
for a change.

313
00:37:57,797 --> 00:38:00,008
Why don't you ask this Robinson
for dinner?

314
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:03,511
Gardiner. Gardiner. Chauncey.
Chauncey Gardiner.

315
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:05,597
Gardiner.

316
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:08,975
You think you're well enough
for dinner, Ben?

317
00:38:11,144 --> 00:38:15,064
Constance, I want fresh blood for dinner.

318
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,733
Yes, sir.

319
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:24,952
I'll have them set another place.

320
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,261
My God, Eve, you'll freeze.

321
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:46,515
No. I just...

322
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:50,394
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

323
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:53,481
How's Mr. Gardiner?

324
00:38:55,274 --> 00:38:57,318
Doesn't seem to be too serious.

325
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,905
But it's a rather large contusion
and I'd like to keep an eye on him...

326
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:03,908
...so I suggested that he stay here
for a couple of days.

327
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:04,992
Here?

328
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:08,871
Mr. Gardiner stay here? Why?
Is that necessary?

329
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:13,962
Not necessary, but helpful.

330
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,673
Don't worry,
he might be a breath of fresh air.

331
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,678
He is different, isn't he?

332
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,681
You know, he's very...

333
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:28,808
...intense.

334
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:30,851
Perhaps.

335
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:33,854
Actually, I found him to have
quite a sense of humor.

336
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:48,831
That's a very small room.

337
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,460
Yes, sir, I guess that's true.
Smallest room in the house.

338
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,879
Yes, I guess that's true.

339
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,571
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital.

340
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:24,950
- Thank you.
- Can I help you to the table, Mr. Gardiner?

341
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:26,120
Thank you.

342
00:40:28,497 --> 00:40:30,333
I feel very good in here.

343
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:33,586
That's the oxygen.

344
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:36,088
When I first got sick...

345
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:40,674
...I had this entire room glassed in...

346
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:44,803
...so they could pump in
some extra oxygen.

347
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:47,473
Keeps my spirits up.

348
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:51,271
You must be very ill.

349
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,107
Aplastic anemia.

350
00:40:56,568 --> 00:41:00,239
The bone marrow doesn't supply
enough red blood cells.

351
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:04,243
Not a damn thing they can do about it.

352
00:41:05,494 --> 00:41:08,163
They can keep me comfortable.

353
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:12,793
Prolong my life with steroid therapy...

354
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:15,756
...and these transfusions.

355
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,008
But what makes my blood boil...

356
00:41:21,593 --> 00:41:23,971
...that is, what there is of it...

357
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:28,016
...is that this is usually...

358
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:30,811
...a young person's disease.

359
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,565
Here I am getting along in years...

360
00:41:35,148 --> 00:41:38,652
...and I'm about to die
of a young person's disease.

361
00:41:43,993 --> 00:41:46,745
I've never seen anything like this
on television.

362
00:41:47,955 --> 00:41:49,957
Please, lie still, Mr. Gardiner.

363
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:54,503
You'll join us for dinner, of course.

364
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:56,880
Yes, please. Thank you.

365
00:41:57,089 --> 00:41:58,465
I'm very hungry.

366
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:03,176
Yes, so am I, my boy.

367
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:06,433
So am I.

368
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,107
Do you know Raphael?

369
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:18,612
No, sir. I don't believe I do.

370
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,364
Because I have a message for him.

371
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:22,657
Yes, sir?

372
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:26,328
A small black man
gave me a message for Raphael.

373
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:33,712
I still don't believe I know the man,
Mr. Gardiner. Now, please...

374
00:42:34,504 --> 00:42:35,714
...lie still.

375
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,565
Is there anyone we could notify for you?

376
00:42:58,695 --> 00:42:59,696
No.

377
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,742
The old man died and Louise left.

378
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,538
I'm very sorry.

379
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:16,546
I do hope your injury won't prevent you
from attending to business.

380
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:21,132
Do you need a secretary?

381
00:43:21,928 --> 00:43:23,221
No, thank you.

382
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:26,224
My house was shut down.

383
00:43:29,686 --> 00:43:32,146
You mean your business was shut down?

384
00:43:33,106 --> 00:43:34,065
Yes.

385
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:37,443
Shut down and closed by the attorneys.

386
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:42,740
What did I tell you?
That's exactly what I mean.

387
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,206
The businessman today is at the mercy
of kid lawyers from the SEC.

388
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:51,167
It's happening to everyone, I'm afraid.

389
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:55,130
The way things are going, they'll probably
legislate the medical profession...

390
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:56,631
...right out of existence.

391
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,801
Yes. Right out of existence.

392
00:44:04,262 --> 00:44:06,139
Yeah, it's a damn shame.

393
00:44:09,117 --> 00:44:11,452
What are your plans now, Mr. Gardiner?

394
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:13,498
Or may I call you Chauncey?

395
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,210
Chauncey's fine.

396
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:23,717
So then, what are your plans, Chauncey?

397
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,560
I would like to work in your garden.

398
00:44:39,902 --> 00:44:43,320
I know exactly what he means.
Isn't it wonderful...

399
00:44:44,238 --> 00:44:46,907
...to be with the trees
and the flowers like that?

400
00:44:48,617 --> 00:44:50,703
I never had much feel for it, myself.

401
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:54,457
I'm a very good gardener.

402
00:44:55,374 --> 00:44:58,961
It's such a pleasant way
to forget one's troubles.

403
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:07,263
Isn't that what any businessman is?
A gardener.

404
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:09,390
He...

405
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:11,768
...works on...

406
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,062
...flinty soil...

407
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:16,773
...to make it productive...

408
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:19,442
...with the labor of his own hands.

409
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:21,361
He waters it...

410
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:24,320
...with the sweat of his own brow.

411
00:45:25,112 --> 00:45:28,451
He makes a thing of value for his family...

412
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,412
...and for the community.

413
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:36,125
Yes, indeed, Chauncey,
a productive businessman...

414
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,796
...is a laborer in the vineyard.

415
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:45,051
I know exactly what you mean.

416
00:45:46,636 --> 00:45:49,389
The garden that I left was such a place.

417
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:56,565
I don't have that anymore. All I have left...

418
00:45:57,441 --> 00:45:59,193
...is the room upstairs.

419
00:46:00,111 --> 00:46:02,655
Come on, now, wait a minute, Chauncey.

420
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,613
You've got your health.

421
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:10,035
For God's sake, man, you can't let those
bastards get you down. You've got to fight.

422
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:15,791
I don't want to hear anymore from you
about that room upstairs.

423
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:19,213
That's where I'm going, too damn soon.

424
00:46:31,142 --> 00:46:33,144
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

425
00:46:34,645 --> 00:46:38,024
I'm sure it is.
That's what they say, anyway.

426
00:46:50,286 --> 00:46:51,454
You know...

427
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:57,501
...there are thousands of businessmen,
large and small...

428
00:46:58,836 --> 00:47:00,379
...in your situation.

429
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:04,050
I've...

430
00:47:04,884 --> 00:47:08,390
...given the matter a good deal
of consideration for some time.

431
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:12,561
They've been harassed long enough by...

432
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,357
...inflation, increased taxation...

433
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:18,901
...all sorts of indecencies.

434
00:47:19,151 --> 00:47:23,947
After all, they're our strongest defense
against the pollutants...

435
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:25,739
...of our basic freedoms...

436
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,202
...as well as the well-being
of our middle class.

437
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:37,628
I've been thinking about starting
a financial assistance fund.

438
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:44,551
Tell me, would you have any ideas
on that subject?

439
00:47:46,178 --> 00:47:47,471
No, Ben.

440
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:51,684
Reluctant to speak, eh?

441
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,318
I can understand that.

442
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,529
After a man's lost everything...

443
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:05,489
...anger tends to block out rationality,
for a while.

444
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:10,160
But, you work on the idea.

445
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:12,996
Water it.

446
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:15,040
Fertilize it.

447
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,252
I will, Ben. Yes.

448
00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:23,635
I'm sure you'll sprout some thoughts
in a few days.

449
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:27,347
I will, Ben. Yes.

450
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:43,947
Sorry, sir.

451
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:49,119
I thought you were going to come out with
another jest about the elevator.

452
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:50,662
Excuse me.

453
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:01,214
Elevator.

454
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,176
Yes, sir.

455
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:05,844
Elevator.

456
00:49:10,724 --> 00:49:13,060
I just wanted you to know
how delighted I am...

457
00:49:13,143 --> 00:49:16,774
...that you're staying with us
and how dreadful I feel about your leg.

458
00:49:16,857 --> 00:49:17,983
Thank you, Eve.

459
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:23,697
You lifted Ben's spirits tonight
to such an extent, do you know that?

460
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:27,282
He liked you so much. He really did.

461
00:49:29,368 --> 00:49:32,746
Ben is very ill, Eve. I've seen that before.

462
00:49:33,997 --> 00:49:34,998
I know.

463
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,876
He reminds me of the old man.

464
00:49:39,422 --> 00:49:40,423
Does he?

465
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,347
Are you going to leave and close
this house when Ben dies?

466
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:54,354
Why, I don't think so.

467
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,316
Goodnight, Eve.

468
00:50:01,152 --> 00:50:02,445
Goodnight, Chauncey.

469
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:32,769
- 'Morning, Mr. Perkins.
- 'Morning, Mr. Riff.

470
00:50:32,853 --> 00:50:33,854
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks.

471
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:37,733
We have an additional guest with us today,
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

472
00:50:38,442 --> 00:50:41,737
I see. Shall we set up the communications
in the usual place?

473
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,989
- Of course.
- Okay, let's go to work.

474
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,312
Would you like a car, sir?

475
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:18,024
Yes, I would like a car.

476
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:19,235
Yes, sir.

477
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:20,695
Thank you.

478
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:24,574
Send up number seven, please.

479
00:51:27,243 --> 00:51:30,578
Chauncey, there you are.
What are you doing on that leg?

480
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,414
It's fine today, Robert.

481
00:51:33,498 --> 00:51:36,417
Shame on you.
Let me be the judge of that.

482
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,586
Please, sit in the chair.

483
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:43,800
I swear, between you and Benjamin,
I've got my hands full.

484
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:48,515
Say, that is coming along.
The swelling's gone down considerably.

485
00:51:48,598 --> 00:51:49,974
Your limousine, sir.

486
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:55,105
Fine. Thank you.

487
00:52:01,653 --> 00:52:03,697
Are you going somewhere?

488
00:52:05,281 --> 00:52:06,282
No.

489
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:15,710
Anyway, the President's volunteered
to sit in for Ben at the convention.

490
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:19,588
Quite a nice gesture.
They're due here soon, I believe.

491
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:23,718
I know about the President coming.

492
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,721
- You do, do you?
- Yes.

493
00:52:27,138 --> 00:52:29,515
Ben would like me to meet the President.

494
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:31,809
- He would, would he?
- Yes.

495
00:52:37,442 --> 00:52:39,527
How will I know when it's 10:00?

496
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:48,828
It's 9:10, now.

497
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:53,372
And if you don't see a clock...

498
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,085
...I'm sure someone will have the time.

499
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:01,090
I understand.

500
00:53:02,967 --> 00:53:04,427
I'm going to walk.

501
00:53:05,553 --> 00:53:08,347
Walk? Well, yes, hell yes. Walk.

502
00:53:09,057 --> 00:53:11,809
- You're meeting the President, aren't you?
- Yes.

503
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:15,104
I've watched him on television.

504
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:44,301
It's very precise, sir.

505
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:46,303
It's 10:00.

506
00:53:48,764 --> 00:53:50,142
Thank you, Jim.

507
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,108
Mrs. Aubrey, the President is arriving.

508
00:54:43,991 --> 00:54:47,745
- Up and around this morning, are you?
- I like to walk, Ben.

509
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,830
That's good news, my boy.

510
00:54:51,123 --> 00:54:53,290
You look much better today.

511
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,377
It's all make-up.

512
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,255
I asked Nurse Teresa to fix me up a bit.

513
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:04,801
I didn't want the President to think
I would die while he was talking to me.

514
00:55:05,763 --> 00:55:06,930
I see.

515
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:10,434
Nobody likes a dying man.

516
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:13,645
Because nobody knows what death is.

517
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:18,275
You seem to be an exception.

518
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:23,655
That's one of the things I admire
about you, your admirable balance.

519
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:27,493
You seem to be a truly peaceful man.

520
00:55:28,702 --> 00:55:31,082
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.

521
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,252
Nurse Teresa did a very good job there.

522
00:56:58,336 --> 00:57:00,964
Mr. Rand, the President is arriving.

523
00:57:02,007 --> 00:57:06,219
Just show the President into the library.
We'll be along in a few minutes.

524
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:11,770
An old habit that goes along with power:
Keep them waiting.

525
00:57:13,646 --> 00:57:15,065
Not now, Arthur.

526
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,399
But, sir...

527
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:19,319
I'm going to meet the President...

528
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,113
...on my own two feet.

529
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:28,536
Shall we go?

530
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:30,580
That's a very good idea.

531
00:57:47,972 --> 00:57:52,143
When I was younger,
I had thoughts of public office.

532
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:54,938
But I found that...

533
00:57:55,188 --> 00:57:59,067
...I was able to contribute more
as a private citizen.

534
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:01,486
Of course, my...

535
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:05,784
...wealth provided me
with considerable influence.

536
00:58:06,451 --> 00:58:09,454
But I've tried, believe me, I've tried...

537
00:58:10,205 --> 00:58:12,499
...not to misuse that power.

538
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:18,545
It's extremely important
that we don't allow ourselves...

539
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:22,674
...to become blinded to the needs
of our government...

540
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,802
...no matter how strong the temptation.

541
00:58:27,932 --> 00:58:30,476
I've been labeled a kingmaker...

542
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,937
...but I've tried...

543
00:58:33,479 --> 00:58:36,691
...to keep myself open
to the voice of the people.

544
00:58:37,692 --> 00:58:40,486
And I've remained honest to myself.

545
00:58:41,362 --> 00:58:42,989
That's the main thing.

546
00:58:43,072 --> 00:58:45,700
- Good morning, Mr. Rand.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

547
00:59:05,678 --> 00:59:07,472
Where the hell is he?

548
00:59:08,848 --> 00:59:10,349
Mr. President.

549
00:59:11,851 --> 00:59:12,935
Ben.

550
00:59:29,454 --> 00:59:31,998
It's good to see you. You look terrific.

551
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:34,376
Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:37,502
Your visit has helped to raise my spirits.

553
00:59:38,378 --> 00:59:40,671
I've missed you, my friend.

554
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:44,387
Come, sit down. Take a load off your feet.

555
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:49,225
Hello, Mr. President.

556
00:59:52,228 --> 00:59:53,187
Hello.

557
00:59:55,564 --> 01:00:00,152
I want you to meet my very dear friend,
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

558
01:00:02,613 --> 01:00:06,909
On television, Mr. President,
you look much smaller.

559
01:00:08,454 --> 01:00:12,333
I must warn you,
Chauncey's not a man to bandy words.

560
01:00:13,584 --> 01:00:15,670
Oh? Really?

561
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:22,842
Well, Mr. Gardiner, I'm a man
who appreciates a frank discussion.

562
01:00:25,302 --> 01:00:27,805
- Would you be seated?
- Yes, I will.

563
01:00:38,693 --> 01:00:41,487
- Ben, I was wondering if you had a chance...
- Yes?

564
01:00:45,867 --> 01:00:48,494
- Did you happen to have a chance to go...
- Yes?

565
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,958
Ben, did you read my speech?

566
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,460
Overall, pretty good.

567
01:00:58,297 --> 01:01:02,217
But I think, Mr. President,
that it is very dangerous...

568
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:06,013
...to play around with temporary measures
at a time like this.

569
01:01:06,638 --> 01:01:08,182
Ben, I mean...

570
01:01:08,474 --> 01:01:10,142
I sympathize with you...

571
01:01:10,893 --> 01:01:13,937
...and I know how difficult it is
to be straightforward.

572
01:01:15,147 --> 01:01:16,899
But I'll tell you right now, Bobby...

573
01:01:33,626 --> 01:01:36,253
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Riff. Secret Service.

574
01:01:37,129 --> 01:01:38,504
Good. Of course.

575
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,592
What you're saying, Ben, is that...

576
01:01:44,718 --> 01:01:48,307
...you don't think I should take the chance.
- Absolutely not.

577
01:01:56,565 --> 01:02:00,569
Do you agree with Ben, or do you think
we can stimulate growth through...

578
01:02:01,862 --> 01:02:03,572
...temporary incentives?

579
01:02:15,212 --> 01:02:18,048
As long as the roots are not severed...

580
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:20,424
...all is well.

581
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:22,926
And all will be well...

582
01:02:23,885 --> 01:02:25,262
...in the garden.

583
01:02:30,892 --> 01:02:32,686
- In the garden?
- Yes.

584
01:02:39,987 --> 01:02:43,490
In a garden, growth has its season.

585
01:02:46,368 --> 01:02:48,412
First comes spring and summer...

586
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,206
...but then we have...

587
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:54,043
...fall and winter.

588
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:58,380
And then we get spring and summer again.

589
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:05,929
- Spring and summer?
- Yes.

590
01:03:08,766 --> 01:03:10,809
- And fall and winter?
- Yes.

591
01:03:17,733 --> 01:03:22,780
I think what our insightful
young friend is saying...

592
01:03:24,073 --> 01:03:27,493
...is that we welcome the inevitable...

593
01:03:27,868 --> 01:03:29,581
...seasons of nature...

594
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:34,127
...but we're upset by the seasons
of our economy.

595
01:03:34,628 --> 01:03:35,587
Yes.

596
01:03:36,254 --> 01:03:38,382
There will be growth in the spring.

597
01:03:43,802 --> 01:03:47,680
I must admit, that is one of the most
refreshing and optimistic statements...

598
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:49,933
...I've heard in a very long time.

599
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:55,232
I admire your good, solid sense.

600
01:03:55,899 --> 01:03:58,443
That's precisely what we lack
on Capitol Hill.

601
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:05,534
I must be going.

602
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:09,079
- This visit has been most enlightening.
- Yes, it has.

603
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:14,459
And Ben, thank you
for your time and thought.

604
01:04:14,543 --> 01:04:16,002
Oh, nonsense.

605
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,258
Thank you for taking time out
with a dying man.

606
01:04:19,341 --> 01:04:21,216
No, I won't have any of that.

607
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,511
Why don't you listen
to your friend Chauncey?

608
01:04:24,636 --> 01:04:26,930
This is a time to think of life.

609
01:04:30,308 --> 01:04:32,144
That's right, Mr. President.

610
01:04:34,062 --> 01:04:35,856
Now, you take care, Ben.

611
01:04:36,898 --> 01:04:38,859
And you take care, too, Bobby.

612
01:04:43,238 --> 01:04:44,325
Chauncey.

613
01:04:45,243 --> 01:04:46,286
Bobby.

614
01:05:03,718 --> 01:05:06,262
He's a decent fellow, isn't he,
the President?

615
01:05:07,597 --> 01:05:10,101
Yes. I'm glad he came.

616
01:05:14,022 --> 01:05:17,609
Kaufman, I'll need some information
on Chauncey Gardiner's background.

617
01:05:17,692 --> 01:05:20,695
- Gardiner, yes, sir.
- And I'd like it sometime today.

618
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:22,405
No problem, chief.

619
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,007
You know...

620
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,843
...you don't play games with words...

621
01:05:45,053 --> 01:05:46,679
...to protect yourself.

622
01:05:47,514 --> 01:05:49,516
No, you're direct.

623
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:55,855
Do you remember what I was talking
to you about last night?

624
01:05:58,274 --> 01:06:00,905
- No.
- Sure you do.

625
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:05,201
My plan for financial assistance
to businessmen.

626
01:06:07,995 --> 01:06:13,084
I think you're just the man to take charge
of an institution like that.

627
01:06:16,879 --> 01:06:18,172
I understand.

628
01:06:24,135 --> 01:06:28,224
I know you're not a man
to act on the spur of the moment...

629
01:06:29,392 --> 01:06:32,562
...so don't feel that you have to rush
into a decision.

630
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:38,651
Thank you.

631
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:43,364
Now, I'm afraid I must excuse myself.

632
01:06:44,657 --> 01:06:46,325
I'm awfully tired.

633
01:07:04,844 --> 01:07:06,888
I'm sorry you're so sick.

634
01:07:35,586 --> 01:07:38,506
We have 60,000 tulip bulbs up there.

635
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:41,052
It is so glorious when they bloom.

636
01:07:42,095 --> 01:07:44,428
Of course, the roses are my favorites.

637
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:46,639
We have 20,000 rose bushes.

638
01:07:48,933 --> 01:07:52,019
And over here,
we plant something different every year.

639
01:07:52,686 --> 01:07:55,606
I haven't quite decided
what we'll plant this year.

640
01:07:56,649 --> 01:07:58,692
And that's the gardener's house.

641
01:08:05,952 --> 01:08:07,787
And this is the greenhouse.

642
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,167
I like to watch the young plants grow.

643
01:08:14,127 --> 01:08:16,212
- It's wonderful, isn't it?
- Yes.

644
01:08:17,505 --> 01:08:20,675
Young plants do much better
if a person helps them.

645
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,348
You know...

646
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:34,398
...Ben told me that the President
was very taken with you this morning.

647
01:08:43,282 --> 01:08:46,410
Last night you mentioned
an old man that died.

648
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:50,456
You must've been very close to him.

649
01:08:50,539 --> 01:08:51,749
I was. Yes.

650
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:54,501
I'm sorry.

651
01:08:58,674 --> 01:09:02,720
You mentioned also
that Louise had gone, also.

652
01:09:04,055 --> 01:09:06,055
Were you very close to Louise?

653
01:09:06,513 --> 01:09:08,515
Yes, I liked Louise very much.

654
01:09:09,099 --> 01:09:10,559
She was his maid.

655
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:15,064
- Oh, his maid.
- Yes.

656
01:09:17,232 --> 01:09:18,358
I see.

657
01:09:19,943 --> 01:09:23,324
So stupid of me. I thought maybe
she was perhaps someone...

658
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:26,619
...you were romantically involved with
or maybe a sister.

659
01:09:27,286 --> 01:09:28,412
No.

660
01:09:28,704 --> 01:09:31,874
She used to bring me my meals.

661
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:33,918
She was very kind to me.

662
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:45,847
Chauncey Gardiner, Mr. Rand's friend and
advisor, was at the meeting this morning.

663
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,104
I found Mr. Gardiner to have a feeling
for this country that we need more of.

664
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:57,275
To quote Mr. Gardiner,
a most intuitive man:

665
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:03,156
"As long as the roots of industry remain
firmly planted in the national soil...

666
01:10:04,449 --> 01:10:07,285
"...the economic prospects
are undoubtedly sunny."

667
01:10:12,059 --> 01:10:13,560
- What is it?
- Doctor.

668
01:10:14,728 --> 01:10:16,522
Decoral. Five milligrams.

669
01:10:16,855 --> 01:10:18,649
Now, I know that many of you...

670
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:21,193
Put your arms up.

671
01:10:22,361 --> 01:10:24,071
I think you'd better leave, Eve.

672
01:10:24,196 --> 01:10:25,904
- Will he be okay?
- He'll be fine.

673
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:27,739
Yeah, we got you, Ben.

674
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:31,493
Come on, Chauncey.

675
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:35,372
But I have decided
there are no temporary stopgaps.

676
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,295
So I'm going to rethink my position
and find another solution.

677
01:10:41,547 --> 01:10:43,549
You'll be very pleased to know that your...

678
01:10:43,632 --> 01:10:45,759
...founder and Chairman of the Board...

679
01:10:45,884 --> 01:10:49,054
...Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand,
agrees with me on this...

680
01:10:49,763 --> 01:10:50,931
...for once.

681
01:10:55,143 --> 01:10:59,565
Gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable
chill and storms of autumn and winter.

682
01:10:59,731 --> 01:11:02,988
Instead, let us anticipate
the rapid growth of springtime.

683
01:11:03,905 --> 01:11:06,074
Let us await the rewards of summer.

684
01:11:07,073 --> 01:11:10,118
As in a garden of the earth,
let us learn to accept...

685
01:11:10,243 --> 01:11:12,871
...and appreciate the times
when the trees are bare...

686
01:11:13,496 --> 01:11:16,207
...as well as the times
when we pick the fruit.

687
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:25,258
I'm just so very grateful
that you're here with us.

688
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:28,096
So am I, Eve.

689
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:32,587
It's been an exhausting day for Ben.

690
01:11:33,338 --> 01:11:36,132
He's resting now,
and there's no cause for alarm.

691
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:39,552
I have a telephone call for you.

692
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:43,681
Telephone call?

693
01:11:44,265 --> 01:11:48,435
Yes. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor
of the Washington Post.

694
01:11:52,191 --> 01:11:54,235
Would you care to take it, sir?

695
01:11:56,403 --> 01:11:57,279
Yes.

696
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,615
In my office.

697
01:12:11,418 --> 01:12:13,796
Go, I'll be just fine.

698
01:12:16,673 --> 01:12:18,177
Yes, you'll be fine.

699
01:12:30,314 --> 01:12:32,441
He's such a kind and sensitive man.

700
01:12:33,526 --> 01:12:34,777
Don't you think?

701
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:53,130
- He's not there.
- Not there?

702
01:12:55,507 --> 01:12:57,342
Mr. Courtney, are you there?

703
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:00,095
Yes, he's there.

704
01:13:06,185 --> 01:13:08,022
Where is he? There or here?

705
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,691
He's on both lines.

706
01:13:22,368 --> 01:13:23,870
Are you there?

707
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:26,331
Yes, I'm here.

708
01:13:26,873 --> 01:13:28,416
Hello, Mr. Gardiner.

709
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:32,590
I saw the President's speech
at the Financial Institute today.

710
01:13:32,715 --> 01:13:34,258
Would you care to comment...

711
01:13:34,884 --> 01:13:38,387
...on the meeting between Mr. Rand
and the President and yourself?

712
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:42,682
Yes. It was very nice meeting...

713
01:13:43,183 --> 01:13:44,184
...the President.

714
01:13:44,851 --> 01:13:47,604
What we'd like to know are some facts.

715
01:13:47,854 --> 01:13:51,441
Such as, what is the exact relationship
between yourself and the...

716
01:13:51,817 --> 01:13:54,110
...First American Financial Corporation?

717
01:13:54,444 --> 01:13:56,738
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.

718
01:13:57,616 --> 01:14:02,162
Well, yes, sir. But Mr. Rand is ill,
so I'm taking the liberty of asking you.

719
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:07,543
What? Say that again.

720
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:14,090
I said that since Mr. Rand is ill,
I'm taking the liberty of asking you.

721
01:14:14,924 --> 01:14:16,300
Yes, you are.

722
01:14:17,134 --> 01:14:19,011
You should ask Mr. Rand that.

723
01:14:20,513 --> 01:14:21,848
Of course.

724
01:14:24,185 --> 01:14:26,646
Just one quick question, Mr. Gardiner...

725
01:14:37,532 --> 01:14:39,159
Will you hold a minute, please?

726
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,747
I have the producer
of The Gary Burns Show on the line.

727
01:14:46,123 --> 01:14:49,129
Yes, I have watched that show.

728
01:14:49,713 --> 01:14:53,383
Of course. They would like you to appear
on the show tonight.

729
01:14:53,508 --> 01:14:56,178
The Vice President was scheduled,
but he had to cancel.

730
01:14:57,012 --> 01:14:59,306
They asked if you would be interested.

731
01:14:59,556 --> 01:15:02,100
Yes. I've been on television.

732
01:15:02,309 --> 01:15:03,226
Fine.

733
01:15:03,727 --> 01:15:07,314
Hello, Mr. Hull?
Mr. Gardiner has agreed to do the show.

734
01:15:07,772 --> 01:15:09,481
He's been on television.

735
01:15:11,066 --> 01:15:14,947
Yes. The show will be taped,
and then shown at 10:00...

736
01:15:15,823 --> 01:15:17,283
...but he's to be there...

737
01:15:28,544 --> 01:15:31,547
What do you mean, he's got
no background? That's impossible.

738
01:15:32,965 --> 01:15:36,677
I quoted the man on national television.
He's a very well-known man.

739
01:15:36,802 --> 01:15:38,430
We're well aware of that, sir...

740
01:15:38,514 --> 01:15:40,933
He's a close friend and advisor
of Benjamin Rand.

741
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,186
For Christ's sakes,
we've got volumes of data on Rand.

742
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:46,522
I plan to contact Mr. Rand the minute...

743
01:15:46,647 --> 01:15:48,106
I do not want Ben disturbed.

744
01:15:48,815 --> 01:15:52,402
We have other ways of gathering
information than to trouble a dying man.

745
01:15:52,486 --> 01:15:56,698
Use any agencies that are necessary to get
a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner.

746
01:15:58,826 --> 01:16:01,078
Have it in my office, tomorrow at 7:00.

747
01:16:02,246 --> 01:16:04,584
- I've got to take a leak.
- Right, chief.

748
01:16:10,506 --> 01:16:14,635
Of course, your position in the financial
community carries a lot of weight.

749
01:16:14,844 --> 01:16:19,306
But what caught Gary's interest
was your down-to-earth philosophy.

750
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,141
I see.

751
01:16:23,853 --> 01:16:27,773
Do you realize more people
will be watching you tonight...

752
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:31,821
...than all those that have seen
theater plays in the last 40 years?

753
01:16:32,446 --> 01:16:33,531
- Yes?
- Yes.

754
01:16:34,949 --> 01:16:35,824
Why?

755
01:16:37,617 --> 01:16:39,327
Hell, I don't know.

756
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:42,164
Good.

757
01:16:42,706 --> 01:16:44,499
- This way.
- Thank you.

758
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,255
Gardiner's laconic.
He plays his cards very close to the chest...

759
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:53,468
...and the scuttlebutt is
he's a strong candidate for a seat...

760
01:16:53,552 --> 01:16:55,762
...on the board of First American Financial.

761
01:16:55,888 --> 01:16:58,098
Kinney, what have you found
on his background?

762
01:16:58,223 --> 01:16:59,183
Nothing.

763
01:16:59,892 --> 01:17:01,268
Yeah, skip the levity.

764
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:05,021
I know it's ridiculous,
but there is no information about Gardiner.

765
01:17:05,563 --> 01:17:07,356
We have no material on him.

766
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:09,984
Zilch.

767
01:17:13,654 --> 01:17:16,407
Here. I want your shoulders to go
right on this pad.

768
01:17:17,283 --> 01:17:20,247
Now, wait, you have to put your head
through the hole first.

769
01:17:20,372 --> 01:17:22,166
Head in the hole.

770
01:17:22,249 --> 01:17:26,045
That's right. Okay. Stretch your legs out,
push your body...

771
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:30,299
Thought you might need this about now.
It gets pretty hot underneath these lights.

772
01:17:30,424 --> 01:17:32,259
Thank you. I'm very thirsty.

773
01:17:34,636 --> 01:17:38,264
If Gary wants to interrupt you,
or ask you a question...

774
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,685
...he'll lift his left forefinger
to his left eyebrow. All right?

775
01:17:45,148 --> 01:17:46,900
- I understand.
- Good.

776
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:48,944
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

777
01:17:54,491 --> 01:17:57,619
- Nurse Teresa did Ben's make-up.
- Really?

778
01:17:58,787 --> 01:18:01,873
- Did she do a good job?
- Yes, it looked just like this.

779
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:05,626
- Looks like you're up.
- I am?

780
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:09,298
- Gary's ready for you now.
- Yes.

781
01:18:11,634 --> 01:18:13,344
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

782
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:14,679
This way.

783
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:55,555
How very nice to have you
with us this evening, Mr. Gardiner.

784
01:18:55,638 --> 01:18:56,723
Hello, Gary.

785
01:18:57,849 --> 01:19:00,769
This is Miss Annie Lawson.
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

786
01:19:00,853 --> 01:19:02,771
- Hi. How do you do?
- Hello.

787
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:12,114
I'd like very much to thank you
for joining us on such short notice...

788
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:14,658
...and filling in for the Vice President.

789
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:15,826
Yes.

790
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:22,166
It's always somewhat surprising
to find men like yourself...

791
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,962
...working so intimately
with the President, and yet...

792
01:19:25,379 --> 01:19:29,008
...somehow managing to remain
relatively unknown.

793
01:19:29,883 --> 01:19:32,344
Yes, it is surprising.

794
01:19:35,013 --> 01:19:36,806
Yes, of course.

795
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:42,437
Your anonymity is certainly likely
to be a thing of the past from now on.

796
01:19:44,606 --> 01:19:45,524
Good.

797
01:19:47,859 --> 01:19:50,365
I assume, since the President quoted you...

798
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:54,410
...that you're inclined to agree
with his view of the economy.

799
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:01,875
Which view?

800
01:20:10,217 --> 01:20:14,346
The President compared the economy
of this country to a garden and he stated...

801
01:20:14,429 --> 01:20:18,102
...that after a period of decline,
a time of growth would naturally follow.

802
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:21,397
Yes.

803
01:20:22,648 --> 01:20:24,066
It is possible...

804
01:20:24,525 --> 01:20:26,944
...for everything...

805
01:20:27,402 --> 01:20:28,862
...to grow strong.

806
01:20:30,029 --> 01:20:31,948
And there is plenty of room...

807
01:20:32,365 --> 01:20:35,368
...for new trees and new flowers...

808
01:20:36,077 --> 01:20:37,245
...of all kinds.

809
01:20:43,461 --> 01:20:45,130
So, you're saying...

810
01:20:45,255 --> 01:20:48,592
...this is just another
season in the garden, so to speak.

811
01:20:49,426 --> 01:20:50,093
Yes.

812
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:55,599
A garden needs a lot of care
and a lot of love.

813
01:20:56,348 --> 01:20:58,267
And if you give your garden...

814
01:20:58,809 --> 01:21:01,270
...a lot of love, things grow.

815
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:04,857
But first, some things must wither.

816
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,322
Some trees die...

817
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,700
- It's that gardener.
- Yeah. Chauncey Gardiner.

818
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,453
No, he's a real gardener.

819
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:19,124
He does talk like one.
But I think he's brilliant.

820
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:29,133
That is very interesting indeed,
but what about the bad seasons?

821
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:33,056
Doesn't a country need
to have someone in charge...

822
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:35,642
...who can see it through
these periods of crisis?

823
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:40,480
A leader, capable of guiding us through
the bad seasons, as well as the good?

824
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:43,066
- Yes.
- That bastard means it.

825
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:44,651
Oh, yes.

826
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:47,654
We need a very good gardener.

827
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:51,574
And I do agree with the President...

828
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:54,368
...that the garden needs a lot of care.

829
01:21:56,163 --> 01:21:57,790
It is a good garden.

830
01:21:58,624 --> 01:22:00,209
Its trees are healthy...

831
01:22:11,345 --> 01:22:15,266
I realize this might be a difficult question
for you to answer, but...

832
01:22:16,058 --> 01:22:18,686
...do you feel that we have...

833
01:22:19,186 --> 01:22:23,109
...in your words,
a very good gardener in office...

834
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:24,527
...at this time?

835
01:22:25,528 --> 01:22:26,529
Jesus!

836
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:31,534
Yes, some plants...

837
01:22:32,285 --> 01:22:33,911
...do well in the sun...

838
01:22:34,745 --> 01:22:37,665
...and others grow better in the shade.

839
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:41,669
Sounds as if we need
a lot of gardening here.

840
01:22:42,003 --> 01:22:43,421
We certainly do.

841
01:22:45,214 --> 01:22:48,177
It's for sure a white man's world
in America.

842
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:55,309
I raised that boy
since he was the size of a piss ant...

843
01:22:56,768 --> 01:23:00,564
...and I'll say right now he never learned
to read and write.

844
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,316
No, sir.

845
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:04,985
He had no brains at all.

846
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:08,780
Stuffed with rice pudding
between the ears.

847
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:14,705
Short-changed by the Lord
and dumb as a jackass.

848
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,666
Look at him now.

849
01:23:19,877 --> 01:23:23,296
Yes, sir, all you got to be
is white in America...

850
01:23:23,963 --> 01:23:25,506
...to get whatever you want.

851
01:23:30,053 --> 01:23:31,387
Gobbledygook!

852
01:23:32,055 --> 01:23:35,725
What sort of gardener would you be,
Mr. Gardiner?

853
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:41,400
- I am a very serious gardener.
- I'm sure you are, Mr. Gardiner.

854
01:23:41,901 --> 01:23:43,069
Remarkable.

855
01:23:47,907 --> 01:23:50,200
You're fond of him, too, aren't you?

856
01:23:58,750 --> 01:23:59,918
That's good.

857
01:24:05,092 --> 01:24:06,510
That's good.

858
01:24:11,265 --> 01:24:13,433
May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?

859
01:24:14,852 --> 01:24:16,937
Bravo, sir. Outstanding!

860
01:24:25,152 --> 01:24:28,658
Okay, Sally, I'll see you in 20 minutes.

861
01:24:30,076 --> 01:24:31,077
Okay.

862
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:41,754
I won't be long. I've just got to talk to her
about this gardener.

863
01:24:42,505 --> 01:24:43,673
Goodnight.

864
01:24:44,924 --> 01:24:47,468
- Look, Johanna...
- I said, goodnight.

865
01:24:59,774 --> 01:25:01,234
Tomorrow night...

866
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:05,697
...Senator Rowley's widow...

867
01:25:07,115 --> 01:25:11,286
...is holding a reception
for the Soviet ambassador.

868
01:25:12,787 --> 01:25:17,335
It's pretty obvious that Robert here
is not going to allow me to attend.

869
01:25:18,544 --> 01:25:21,130
So, you'd be doing me a great favor...

870
01:25:21,839 --> 01:25:25,551
...if you would attend in my place,
and escort Eve.

871
01:25:27,887 --> 01:25:28,971
Yes, Ben.

872
01:25:30,181 --> 01:25:32,266
I would love to escort Eve.

873
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:38,356
You and Eve should create quite a stir.

874
01:25:42,195 --> 01:25:44,197
I can already hear the gossip.

875
01:25:48,909 --> 01:25:52,079
You have the gift of being natural.

876
01:25:53,413 --> 01:25:55,374
That's a great talent, my boy.

877
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:59,628
I hope the entire country was listening.

878
01:25:59,711 --> 01:26:01,338
The entire country.

879
01:26:09,891 --> 01:26:11,601
Darling, what's wrong?

880
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,270
I can't.

881
01:26:14,688 --> 01:26:16,689
I just can't, right now.

882
01:26:22,194 --> 01:26:24,154
I'm sorry, dearest. I just...

883
01:26:26,574 --> 01:26:27,825
I just can't.

884
01:26:37,503 --> 01:26:41,090
We'll fix up one of Ben's for you.
Sophie insists on black tie.

885
01:26:41,924 --> 01:26:42,884
I see.

886
01:26:49,431 --> 01:26:51,182
- Chauncey?
- Yes?

887
01:26:54,519 --> 01:26:56,521
I don't have very many friends.

888
01:26:58,317 --> 01:27:00,027
And Ben's friends are...

889
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:03,405
...quite a bit older than I am.

890
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:05,449
Quite a bit.

891
01:27:28,224 --> 01:27:29,308
Goodnight.

892
01:27:31,185 --> 01:27:32,311
Goodnight.

893
01:27:54,793 --> 01:27:59,089
He was very clever, keeping it at a third
grade level, that's what they understand.

894
01:27:59,172 --> 01:28:03,843
Yeah? I don't understand
why he was in Jennings' house.

895
01:28:04,678 --> 01:28:07,764
What was up his sleeve
when he pulled that stunt with us?

896
01:28:07,847 --> 01:28:10,517
What was he doing? And why?

897
01:28:11,141 --> 01:28:14,564
Who knows? Maybe the government
had something to do with it.

898
01:28:17,066 --> 01:28:18,276
You know...

899
01:28:19,318 --> 01:28:20,820
...he made a fool out of me.

900
01:28:21,737 --> 01:28:23,990
- And you know what that means?
- No.

901
01:28:24,073 --> 01:28:27,994
Any political future I had
is right down the toilet.

902
01:28:28,452 --> 01:28:32,331
Jesus, the thought of spending
the rest of my life as an attorney...

903
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,583
Well...

904
01:28:33,749 --> 01:28:36,919
...that is really a downer. And, Christ...

905
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:41,509
...I almost forgot. Johanna is starting
to think something's going on.

906
01:28:41,593 --> 01:28:43,970
Sid, be reasonable.
I have been everywhere.

907
01:28:44,053 --> 01:28:46,681
- There is no place left to look.
- Try again.

908
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:50,602
Sure, try again. Where? There's nothing.

909
01:28:51,227 --> 01:28:53,313
It's like Gardiner never existed.

910
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:55,148
Try again.

911
01:28:55,815 --> 01:28:57,233
Sid, it's useless.

912
01:28:57,734 --> 01:28:59,235
I said, try again.

913
01:29:00,486 --> 01:29:03,658
Up yours. You try again. I quit.

914
01:29:20,424 --> 01:29:22,885
- 'Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

915
01:29:22,968 --> 01:29:25,596
- We found no information...
- It's not what I requested.

916
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:27,934
...before Mr. Gardiner appeared
at the Rands'.

917
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:31,145
This information goes back
a day and a half.

918
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:34,440
- I want the standard file, you know that.
- Right, chief.

919
01:29:35,608 --> 01:29:37,151
Well, where is it?

920
01:29:38,401 --> 01:29:39,611
Right, chief.

921
01:29:39,945 --> 01:29:42,155
Kaufman, what the hell
are you talking about?

922
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:46,451
The Bureau has some data, sir,
but it's not pertinent.

923
01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:49,829
- I'd like to hear that data.
- Yes, sir.

924
01:29:51,122 --> 01:29:52,332
His suits...

925
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:55,547
...were made by a New York tailor,
handmade...

926
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,006
...in 1928.

927
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:02,262
The tailor went out of business
in 1933 and later...

928
01:30:03,388 --> 01:30:04,931
...took his own life.

929
01:30:05,682 --> 01:30:08,433
His underwear, all of the finest cloth.

930
01:30:09,268 --> 01:30:12,521
The factory was destroyed by fire in 1948.

931
01:30:13,146 --> 01:30:14,982
This man carries no identification.

932
01:30:15,649 --> 01:30:19,905
No driver's license, no wallet,
no credit cards.

933
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:24,785
Computers have analyzed his...

934
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:28,163
- Miss Davies.
...vocal characteristics.

935
01:30:28,372 --> 01:30:30,749
I'd like my eggs poached
this morning, please.

936
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:34,336
But they cannot determine
his ethnic background.

937
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:45,557
Come in.

938
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:58,361
Have you read the newspapers?

939
01:30:59,446 --> 01:31:00,947
I don't read papers.

940
01:31:01,114 --> 01:31:05,117
You're described as one of the architects
of the President's speech last night.

941
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:09,458
And your comments on the television show
are quoted alongside the President's.

942
01:31:12,461 --> 01:31:15,255
I like the President very much.
He's a nice man.

943
01:31:23,639 --> 01:31:25,224
You're very nice, too.

944
01:31:26,225 --> 01:31:29,728
Hi, neighbor.
There's somebody at the door.

945
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:33,651
Let's see who that special person is.
It's Mr. McFeeland.

946
01:31:45,787 --> 01:31:48,081
You don't mind my being here like...

947
01:31:49,332 --> 01:31:50,542
...this?

948
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:51,876
No.

949
01:31:52,835 --> 01:31:54,462
I like you to be here.

950
01:31:57,674 --> 01:31:58,885
You do?

951
01:32:15,943 --> 01:32:19,697
I'd like to sing about something
even more special.

952
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,074
And that something is you.

953
01:33:44,956 --> 01:33:46,415
Thank you.

954
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:48,584
I'm so grateful.

955
01:33:51,796 --> 01:33:53,297
I would've just...

956
01:33:54,465 --> 01:33:57,385
...opened up at the slightest touch.

957
01:33:58,386 --> 01:34:01,471
I would've just opened up. You know?
You know that.

958
01:34:03,598 --> 01:34:05,394
But you're so strong...

959
01:34:06,562 --> 01:34:08,814
...that I can trust myself with you.

960
01:34:10,857 --> 01:34:12,859
I'm glad you didn't open.

961
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:44,642
A long time ago,
people didn't have television...

962
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,730
...but they still liked to look
at interesting pictures.

963
01:34:49,355 --> 01:34:51,900
And they would put pictures like these...

964
01:34:52,358 --> 01:34:54,402
- Thank you.
...in a special viewer.

965
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:59,701
They would look at them very carefully.
I'll show you another one.

966
01:35:07,042 --> 01:35:08,752
They looked like cards.

967
01:35:09,044 --> 01:35:11,546
Flash cards for schools or something.

968
01:35:12,088 --> 01:35:16,218
But they're really photographs.
Take a careful look at them.

969
01:35:16,927 --> 01:35:20,015
The interesting thing about them,
is that they're two.

970
01:35:20,432 --> 01:35:21,516
One. Two.

971
01:35:21,975 --> 01:35:23,894
And they look very much alike.

972
01:35:24,728 --> 01:35:26,395
Here, I'll show you another one.

973
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,275
Mr. Thomas Franklin, please.

974
01:35:37,156 --> 01:35:38,658
Is Mr. Franklin in?

975
01:35:39,742 --> 01:35:42,245
Certainly. This is Dr. Robert Allenby.

976
01:35:43,246 --> 01:35:46,459
Would you tell Mr. Franklin
that I'd like to speak to him?

977
01:35:46,918 --> 01:35:49,462
It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.

978
01:36:10,148 --> 01:36:14,573
What was your reaction to the Post's
editorial on the President's speech?

979
01:36:15,949 --> 01:36:17,450
I did not read that.

980
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:22,455
- But, sir, you must've at least glanced at it.
- I did not glance at it.

981
01:36:22,581 --> 01:36:26,041
The New York Times spoke
of your "peculiar brand of optimism."

982
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:30,004
- What was your reaction to that?
- I do not know what it means.

983
01:36:31,213 --> 01:36:34,466
Sorry to persist, sir,
but it would be of great interest to me...

984
01:36:34,592 --> 01:36:36,971
...to know just what newspapers
you do read.

985
01:36:38,306 --> 01:36:40,892
I do not read papers. I watch TV.

986
01:36:41,601 --> 01:36:45,229
Do you mean that you find
television's coverage of the news...

987
01:36:45,313 --> 01:36:47,940
...better than that of the newspapers?

988
01:36:48,024 --> 01:36:49,734
I like to watch TV.

989
01:36:50,318 --> 01:36:51,402
Thank you.

990
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,653
You're welcome.

991
01:36:55,322 --> 01:36:59,117
Few men in public life have the courage
not to read the newspapers.

992
01:36:59,576 --> 01:37:03,624
None, that this reporter has met,
had the guts to admit it.

993
01:37:08,003 --> 01:37:10,964
I've never seen anyone
handle the press the way you do.

994
01:37:11,089 --> 01:37:12,925
You're so cool and detached.

995
01:37:13,759 --> 01:37:14,843
Thank you.

996
01:37:17,846 --> 01:37:20,265
- How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

997
01:37:20,349 --> 01:37:23,392
I'm very well.
I'd like you to meet Chauncey Gardiner.

998
01:37:24,018 --> 01:37:25,436
Hello, Vladimir.

999
01:37:25,648 --> 01:37:27,858
And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.

1000
01:37:28,734 --> 01:37:31,195
- Natasha.
- Hello, Natasha.

1001
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,781
- Very nice meeting you.
- And you.

1002
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:38,077
You must sit with us, my friends.
We have much to discuss.

1003
01:37:38,202 --> 01:37:39,203
I agree.

1004
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:43,123
Let's let the men talk.
Would you two excuse us for a moment?

1005
01:37:43,582 --> 01:37:47,586
Regretfully, we shall yield
the pleasure of your company to others.

1006
01:37:48,379 --> 01:37:50,130
I shall yield, too.

1007
01:37:51,091 --> 01:37:53,635
Yes. Well, you have a nice chat.

1008
01:37:57,264 --> 01:38:02,060
Shouldn't we get together more often
to exchange our thoughts?

1009
01:38:02,769 --> 01:38:05,397
It's strictly at the rumor stage now, Lyman.

1010
01:38:06,064 --> 01:38:10,235
- But there's something in the wind.
- Something rather big in the wind, I'd say.

1011
01:38:10,318 --> 01:38:14,406
So whose files were destroyed?
The CIA's or the FBI's?

1012
01:38:15,073 --> 01:38:16,326
I don't know.

1013
01:38:17,035 --> 01:38:20,955
You may find, my friend,
that we are not so far from each other.

1014
01:38:21,247 --> 01:38:22,498
Not so far.

1015
01:38:24,584 --> 01:38:26,711
We are not so far from each other.

1016
01:38:27,295 --> 01:38:29,297
Our chairs are almost touching.

1017
01:38:32,174 --> 01:38:33,175
Bravo.

1018
01:38:34,302 --> 01:38:37,138
Our chairs are indeed almost touching.

1019
01:38:37,597 --> 01:38:40,433
And we want to remain seated on them,
correct?

1020
01:38:41,017 --> 01:38:43,939
We don't want them snatched out
from under us, am I right?

1021
01:38:44,023 --> 01:38:47,443
Because, if one goes, the other goes.

1022
01:38:47,985 --> 01:38:50,737
And then boom-boom and boom-boom.

1023
01:38:52,447 --> 01:38:56,451
What is it about his background
that they're trying to cover up?

1024
01:38:56,993 --> 01:39:01,289
A criminal record? A membership
in a subversive organization?

1025
01:39:01,456 --> 01:39:02,957
Homosexual, perhaps.

1026
01:39:03,082 --> 01:39:06,254
He told me that he had been living there
since he was a child...

1027
01:39:06,338 --> 01:39:08,131
...working as a gardener.

1028
01:39:08,465 --> 01:39:11,885
He showed us a room in the garage
where he said he stayed, and...

1029
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:16,014
...I didn't really believe him,
of course, but why the act?

1030
01:39:20,309 --> 01:39:21,393
Tell me...

1031
01:39:22,937 --> 01:39:26,357
...do you, by any chance,
enjoy Krylov's fables?

1032
01:39:27,441 --> 01:39:30,361
Now, I ask you that
because there is something...

1033
01:39:31,447 --> 01:39:33,991
...Krylovian about you.

1034
01:39:37,453 --> 01:39:38,704
Do you think so?

1035
01:39:40,289 --> 01:39:42,667
I believe that you know Krylov.

1036
01:39:54,803 --> 01:39:58,059
So, you know your Krylov in Russian,
do you?

1037
01:39:58,476 --> 01:40:01,646
I must confess,
I had suspected as much all along.

1038
01:40:04,524 --> 01:40:07,360
Excuse me, but would you tell me
your name again?

1039
01:40:09,028 --> 01:40:11,489
A dash of American humor.

1040
01:40:12,824 --> 01:40:14,284
Vladimir Skrapinov.

1041
01:40:15,617 --> 01:40:17,327
That's a very nice name.

1042
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,456
And yours, Chauncey Gardiner.

1043
01:40:35,222 --> 01:40:40,019
He must have been involved
on some major financial level...

1044
01:40:40,144 --> 01:40:41,395
...with the deceased.

1045
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,230
- With who?
- Mr. Jennings.

1046
01:40:44,523 --> 01:40:48,904
But our firm has no record
of any such transactions.

1047
01:40:51,573 --> 01:40:55,577
You had the Russian ambassador eating
right out of your hand. You know that?

1048
01:40:56,119 --> 01:40:58,872
I didn't know you spoke Russian.
It's incredible.

1049
01:40:59,414 --> 01:41:02,000
It is extremely useful
to speak Russian today.

1050
01:41:02,167 --> 01:41:06,004
- Are you proficient in other languages?
- He's so modest, Ambassador Gaufridi.

1051
01:41:06,421 --> 01:41:08,924
He just never advertises
his accomplishments.

1052
01:41:15,766 --> 01:41:17,976
Maybe you should talk to somebody,
darling.

1053
01:41:18,101 --> 01:41:19,102
No.

1054
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,400
No, that wouldn't do any good.

1055
01:41:29,988 --> 01:41:32,574
Hello, Ronald. How are you?

1056
01:41:32,783 --> 01:41:35,953
- Just fine.
- Good. I am fine, too.

1057
01:41:36,203 --> 01:41:39,124
- Good.
- Yes. We're fine.

1058
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,334
Yeah, fine.

1059
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:45,505
My editors and I have been wondering
if you'd consider writing a book for us.

1060
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:49,133
Something about your political philosophy.
What do you say?

1061
01:41:49,884 --> 01:41:52,804
- I can't write.
- Of course not. Who can, nowadays?

1062
01:41:52,887 --> 01:41:56,224
I have trouble writing a postcard
to my children.

1063
01:41:56,307 --> 01:41:58,851
Look, we can give you a six-figure advance.

1064
01:41:58,977 --> 01:42:02,649
I'll provide you with the very best
ghost writer, proofreaders...

1065
01:42:03,108 --> 01:42:05,485
- I can't read.
- Of course, you can't.

1066
01:42:06,027 --> 01:42:07,821
No one has the time.

1067
01:42:07,904 --> 01:42:10,448
We glance at things, we watch television.

1068
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,077
I like to watch TV.

1069
01:42:15,869 --> 01:42:17,997
I'm sure you do. No one reads.

1070
01:42:19,331 --> 01:42:21,875
He's very, very sexy.

1071
01:42:22,376 --> 01:42:24,962
Don't leave me alone with him for too long.

1072
01:42:26,922 --> 01:42:29,303
You say he showed you his garden.

1073
01:42:29,469 --> 01:42:32,306
He said it was his.
He walked us through it.

1074
01:42:33,557 --> 01:42:34,516
I see.

1075
01:42:36,184 --> 01:42:39,438
Mr. Franklin, I must ask you
and Ms. Hayes...

1076
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:43,149
...to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner
strictly to yourselves.

1077
01:42:43,733 --> 01:42:46,485
There's no telling
what he could have been involved in.

1078
01:42:46,611 --> 01:42:49,530
It could be
an extremely confidential matter.

1079
01:42:50,281 --> 01:42:53,453
- Please, not a word.
- Of course, Doctor. I understand.

1080
01:42:53,536 --> 01:42:54,412
Fine.

1081
01:42:54,996 --> 01:42:58,082
- Thank you very much.
- Certainly. Glad to be of help.

1082
01:43:06,382 --> 01:43:08,176
I heard he speaks eight languages.

1083
01:43:08,301 --> 01:43:11,929
And on top of everything else,
holds a degree in medicine as well as law.

1084
01:43:12,054 --> 01:43:13,347
Isn't that true, Eve?

1085
01:43:13,931 --> 01:43:17,017
I don't know, Senator,
but it wouldn't surprise me.

1086
01:43:17,684 --> 01:43:19,271
He's very attractive.

1087
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,023
Isn't he?

1088
01:43:21,815 --> 01:43:25,194
You know, I've never met anyone like you
in Washington before.

1089
01:43:25,903 --> 01:43:27,863
Yes, I've been here all my life.

1090
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:28,948
Really?

1091
01:43:29,073 --> 01:43:32,368
And where have you been all my life?

1092
01:43:35,955 --> 01:43:37,706
Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...

1093
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:42,377
...have you ever had sex with a man?

1094
01:43:47,593 --> 01:43:50,263
No. I don't think so.

1095
01:43:52,598 --> 01:43:54,558
We could go upstairs right now.

1096
01:43:56,644 --> 01:43:58,521
Is there a TV upstairs?

1097
01:44:01,274 --> 01:44:02,608
I like to watch.

1098
01:44:03,401 --> 01:44:05,486
You like to watch?

1099
01:44:05,903 --> 01:44:06,779
Yes.

1100
01:44:07,904 --> 01:44:10,409
You wait right here. I'll go get Warren.

1101
01:44:19,209 --> 01:44:20,419
Is it me?

1102
01:44:21,712 --> 01:44:25,048
- Is it something I've done?
- No, sweetheart, it's not...

1103
01:44:27,342 --> 01:44:28,468
No, it's...

1104
01:44:29,344 --> 01:44:30,596
It's not you.

1105
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:36,477
This never happened
when you were a senator.

1106
01:44:37,061 --> 01:44:39,397
It's not that, it's just that I...

1107
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:45,778
- Yeah, Kaufman, what is it?
- The CIA or the FBI...

1108
01:44:46,029 --> 01:44:48,740
...destroyed Gardiner's files.
- What? Why?

1109
01:44:50,742 --> 01:44:53,578
- Neither agency will admit to a thing.
- All right.

1110
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,790
Get Baldwin and Honeycutt over here.
I'll be right down.

1111
01:45:20,148 --> 01:45:21,816
I feel so close to you.

1112
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:25,030
I feel safe.

1113
01:45:27,908 --> 01:45:31,703
Ben understands my feelings for you,
by the way, and he accepts them.

1114
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:36,666
Ben is very wise.

1115
01:45:48,386 --> 01:45:51,683
Or thirdly, the man's files
have been destroyed.

1116
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:57,438
- Now, I'd like some answers.
- Gardiner's not a foreign agent.

1117
01:45:57,522 --> 01:45:59,941
There are now 16 countries
investigating the man.

1118
01:46:04,236 --> 01:46:05,404
I see.

1119
01:46:06,405 --> 01:46:08,282
What about the third question?

1120
01:46:08,365 --> 01:46:10,951
Is it possible to erase all traces of a man?

1121
01:46:11,159 --> 01:46:12,703
Highly unlikely, sir.

1122
01:46:12,869 --> 01:46:15,792
In fact, the boys around the Bureau feel...

1123
01:46:16,918 --> 01:46:20,171
...that the only one
capable of pulling this off...

1124
01:46:21,047 --> 01:46:22,882
...would be an ex-FBI man.

1125
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:28,805
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.

1126
01:46:30,932 --> 01:46:33,767
What do the boys around Intelligence feel?

1127
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:40,067
Well, Mr. President,
they don't quite know...

1128
01:46:45,906 --> 01:46:47,575
It's very difficult...

1129
01:46:49,952 --> 01:46:52,121
...for me to say goodnight to you.

1130
01:46:53,581 --> 01:46:55,249
It's very hard...

1131
01:46:57,293 --> 01:46:59,003
...for me to leave you.

1132
01:47:00,338 --> 01:47:02,255
It's very hard for me, too.

1133
01:47:22,069 --> 01:47:23,111
No.

1134
01:47:24,404 --> 01:47:26,865
Sell all 750,000 shares...

1135
01:47:28,617 --> 01:47:29,955
...of CCT.

1136
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,375
Let's see.

1137
01:47:40,798 --> 01:47:43,342
Sell a million shares of Inland Oil.

1138
01:47:45,636 --> 01:47:46,929
Mrs. Aubrey...

1139
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:52,476
...have 30,000 shares of Standard...

1140
01:47:53,852 --> 01:47:56,274
...transferred into your account.

1141
01:47:58,317 --> 01:47:59,609
That's for you.

1142
01:48:07,158 --> 01:48:10,495
I was just cleaning up some loose ends.

1143
01:48:12,247 --> 01:48:14,666
Getting rid of the dead wood...

1144
01:48:15,875 --> 01:48:18,003
...so Eve wouldn't have to cope with it.

1145
01:48:25,512 --> 01:48:27,931
I'd like to talk to you about Chauncey.

1146
01:48:37,023 --> 01:48:38,316
You know...

1147
01:48:40,234 --> 01:48:42,445
...there's something about him...

1148
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:44,700
...that I trust.

1149
01:48:46,619 --> 01:48:48,329
He makes me feel good.

1150
01:48:52,374 --> 01:48:54,126
Since he's been around...

1151
01:48:56,754 --> 01:48:58,963
...the thought of dying...

1152
01:49:00,548 --> 01:49:02,550
...has been much easier for me.

1153
01:49:51,269 --> 01:49:52,770
I couldn't stand it.

1154
01:50:49,455 --> 01:50:50,666
What is it?

1155
01:50:52,168 --> 01:50:53,460
What's wrong?

1156
01:51:01,676 --> 01:51:03,094
What's the matter?

1157
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:10,226
I don't know what you like. I'm sorry.

1158
01:51:10,352 --> 01:51:11,811
I like to watch.

1159
01:51:13,897 --> 01:51:16,110
What do you mean, you like to watch?

1160
01:51:17,362 --> 01:51:18,988
I like to watch.

1161
01:51:33,502 --> 01:51:34,628
You mean...

1162
01:51:35,712 --> 01:51:37,714
...me, you like to watch me...

1163
01:51:39,049 --> 01:51:40,133
...do it.

1164
01:51:41,178 --> 01:51:42,471
It's very good.

1165
01:51:53,606 --> 01:51:56,442
No, thanks. I never touch the stuff,, never.

1166
01:51:57,652 --> 01:51:59,195
A cigar, then?

1167
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:01,406
I'll have one of those. Thanks.

1168
01:52:02,907 --> 01:52:04,409
Thanks very much.

1169
01:52:06,746 --> 01:52:08,748
- Sit down, Rico.
- Yeah, thanks.

1170
01:52:17,215 --> 01:52:18,758
Now listen, Rico...

1171
01:52:20,093 --> 01:52:23,929
...I'm going to talk to you, but
you're not going to hear a word I say, see?

1172
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:30,227
This is inside dope and if it gets out,
it'll be just too bad for somebody.

1173
01:52:30,311 --> 01:52:31,481
You know me.

1174
01:52:32,774 --> 01:52:36,236
All right. Get this.
Pete Montana 's through.

1175
01:52:42,367 --> 01:52:45,287
- And I thought he was such a big guy.
- He's through.

1176
01:52:47,581 --> 01:52:51,876
Suppose I were to tell you that,
from now on, you were Pete Montana.

1177
01:52:52,835 --> 01:52:56,341
That you were to take over his territory
in addition to your own.

1178
01:52:57,425 --> 01:52:58,760
Will you shake on it?

1179
01:52:58,885 --> 01:53:02,347
One of the first things you should know
about me, my darling...

1180
01:53:03,264 --> 01:53:05,391
...is that I'm a little shy.

1181
01:53:06,059 --> 01:53:07,602
All right, it's set.

1182
01:53:09,354 --> 01:53:12,523
I'm doing a lot for you, Rico.
When I get you planted...

1183
01:53:12,982 --> 01:53:16,194
...I'll expect plenty of service.
- You'll sure get it.

1184
01:53:16,819 --> 01:53:20,072
Permit me, then, to drink to the new boss
of the North Side.

1185
01:53:20,697 --> 01:53:21,867
Thank you.

1186
01:53:23,243 --> 01:53:24,828
You look great, boss.

1187
01:53:25,162 --> 01:53:26,330
Feels terrible.

1188
01:53:26,413 --> 01:53:30,000
There ain't none of us ever been
invited up to eat at the Big Boy's dump.

1189
01:53:30,084 --> 01:53:32,628
And nobody ever crashed the gate
except Pete Montana.

1190
01:53:32,711 --> 01:53:35,506
If you think I'm going out in this harness,
you're crazy.

1191
01:53:35,589 --> 01:53:37,383
You look fine, boss.

1192
01:54:01,033 --> 01:54:03,369
- Hello, Big Boy.
- Hello, Rico.

1193
01:54:14,757 --> 01:54:17,301
Wow, you're rather lit up tonight,
aren't you?

1194
01:54:20,846 --> 01:54:23,098
This next exercise is trying to...

1195
01:54:23,765 --> 01:54:27,602
...sort of explore and with any explorer,
go slowly.

1196
01:54:32,149 --> 01:54:35,444
Knee to the chest
and experimenting with the weight...

1197
01:54:36,653 --> 01:54:40,659
...and going at this slowly.
Please, nobody leaping up.

1198
01:54:45,538 --> 01:54:47,248
Where did you go?

1199
01:55:20,867 --> 01:55:25,997
Don't be frightened of it. It's important
to know that, yes, you could roll over.

1200
01:55:40,764 --> 01:55:43,557
Tell her to come down.
I'm gonna put in a CVP line.

1201
01:55:46,227 --> 01:55:47,311
No.

1202
01:55:49,397 --> 01:55:51,357
No more shots.

1203
01:55:54,445 --> 01:55:55,571
No more.

1204
01:55:58,241 --> 01:55:59,534
It's not good.

1205
01:56:02,412 --> 01:56:03,454
I know.

1206
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:27,063
You uncoil my wants...

1207
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:31,067
...desire flows within me.

1208
01:56:32,152 --> 01:56:34,446
And when you watch me, my passion...

1209
01:56:36,031 --> 01:56:37,866
...it dissolves the desire.

1210
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:41,036
You set me free.

1211
01:56:45,166 --> 01:56:48,336
And I reveal myself to myself
and I am drenched...

1212
01:56:49,253 --> 01:56:50,504
...and purged.

1213
01:56:54,425 --> 01:56:56,135
Mr. Rand would like to see you.

1214
01:56:57,637 --> 01:56:59,430
I would like to see Ben.

1215
01:57:24,331 --> 01:57:25,457
Yes, Ben?

1216
01:57:27,125 --> 01:57:28,961
Are you going to die now?

1217
01:57:31,463 --> 01:57:32,759
I think I'm...

1218
01:57:33,927 --> 01:57:35,804
...going to surrender the...

1219
01:57:36,888 --> 01:57:38,473
...horn of plenty...

1220
01:57:40,349 --> 01:57:42,351
...for the horn of Gabriel.

1221
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:49,858
Give me your hand.

1222
01:57:52,111 --> 01:57:53,821
Let me feel your strength.

1223
01:58:01,789 --> 01:58:03,833
I hope that you'll stay here...

1224
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,169
...with Eve.

1225
01:58:08,129 --> 01:58:09,504
Take care of her.

1226
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:13,508
She cares for you.

1227
01:58:15,802 --> 01:58:16,886
Watch...

1228
01:58:17,929 --> 01:58:19,306
...over her.

1229
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:23,353
She's a delicate flower.

1230
01:58:24,688 --> 01:58:25,814
A flower.

1231
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:27,733
Yes.

1232
01:58:31,653 --> 01:58:32,738
There's...

1233
01:58:40,036 --> 01:58:41,704
...so much left to do.

1234
01:58:45,082 --> 01:58:48,672
I've spoken to them, my associates.

1235
01:58:50,883 --> 01:58:52,259
They're eager...

1236
01:58:53,594 --> 01:58:55,971
...very eager, to meet you.

1237
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:03,312
Tell Eve...

1238
01:59:29,714 --> 01:59:30,840
He's gone.

1239
01:59:35,886 --> 01:59:37,388
Yes, I know.

1240
01:59:39,266 --> 01:59:41,018
I've seen this before.

1241
01:59:42,186 --> 01:59:44,105
It happens to old people.

1242
02:00:01,664 --> 02:00:03,416
Will you be leaving now?

1243
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:10,591
Yes, in a day or two.

1244
02:00:11,676 --> 02:00:12,760
Yes.

1245
02:00:13,845 --> 02:00:15,221
Eve is staying.

1246
02:00:16,389 --> 02:00:18,975
She said she will not close up the house.

1247
02:00:23,313 --> 02:00:26,774
You've become quite a close friend
of Eve's, haven't you...

1248
02:00:27,650 --> 02:00:28,693
...Chance?

1249
02:00:30,488 --> 02:00:31,573
Yes.

1250
02:00:35,409 --> 02:00:37,244
I love Eve very much.

1251
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:44,626
And you really are a gardener, aren't you?

1252
02:00:46,295 --> 02:00:47,421
I am...

1253
02:00:49,548 --> 02:00:50,841
...a gardener.

1254
02:01:00,811 --> 02:01:04,814
I'll go and tell Eve about Ben.

1255
02:01:17,369 --> 02:01:18,620
I understand.

1256
02:01:26,756 --> 02:01:28,049
I understand.

1257
02:01:30,718 --> 02:01:33,595
I know that Ben said,
"Keep it small and quiet."

1258
02:01:34,638 --> 02:01:36,807
And I don't want to go
against his wishes...

1259
02:01:38,892 --> 02:01:42,896
...but I thought it would be good,
while our friends are carrying Ben to his...

1260
02:01:43,730 --> 02:01:45,567
...last resting place...

1261
02:01:47,236 --> 02:01:49,071
...to read from his quotes.

1262
02:01:50,906 --> 02:01:53,242
"I have no use for those on welfare...

1263
02:01:54,618 --> 02:01:56,537
"...no patience whatsoever.

1264
02:01:57,621 --> 02:02:00,164
"But if I am to be honest with myself...

1265
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:03,543
"...I must admit that they have
no use for me, either.

1266
02:02:07,547 --> 02:02:11,428
"I do not regret having political differences
with men that I respect.

1267
02:02:14,264 --> 02:02:15,974
"I do regret, however...

1268
02:02:18,935 --> 02:02:20,854
"...that our philosophies...

1269
02:02:22,939 --> 02:02:24,482
"...kept us apart."

1270
02:02:27,402 --> 02:02:31,030
Yes, I agree. Except he's so boring.
What about Max?

1271
02:02:31,113 --> 02:02:33,782
- He could never take an election.
- Correct.

1272
02:02:33,866 --> 02:02:36,705
The people of this country
need to be awakened.

1273
02:02:37,873 --> 02:02:41,043
What about Lawson?
He's charismatic, exciting.

1274
02:02:41,626 --> 02:02:44,796
He's too exciting, I'm afraid.
If they start bringing up...

1275
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:48,550
Gentlemen, time is running out.
We must come to a decision.

1276
02:02:53,722 --> 02:02:55,641
"I have heard the word 'sir'...

1277
02:02:57,726 --> 02:02:59,185
"...more often...

1278
02:02:59,979 --> 02:03:02,315
"...than I have heard the word 'friend'.

1279
02:03:03,441 --> 02:03:04,901
"But I suppose...

1280
02:03:06,402 --> 02:03:08,821
"...there are other rewards for wealth.

1281
02:03:10,907 --> 02:03:12,533
"I have met with kings.

1282
02:03:14,118 --> 02:03:15,703
"During these conferences...

1283
02:03:16,079 --> 02:03:20,500
"...I have suppressed bizarre thoughts:
Could I beat him in a foot race?

1284
02:03:21,417 --> 02:03:23,795
"Could I throw a ball further than he?

1285
02:03:25,173 --> 02:03:29,009
"No matter what our faade,
we are all children."

1286
02:03:29,551 --> 02:03:31,470
What about Chauncey Gardiner?

1287
02:03:31,595 --> 02:03:34,515
What do we know of the man?
Absolutely nothing.

1288
02:03:35,057 --> 02:03:37,059
We don't have an inkling of his past.

1289
02:03:37,142 --> 02:03:41,355
Correct. That could be an asset.
A man's past cripples him.

1290
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:45,818
His background turns into a swamp
and invites scrutiny.

1291
02:03:46,986 --> 02:03:50,575
Until this time, he hasn't said anything
that could be held against him.

1292
02:03:50,867 --> 02:03:54,913
And the mail and telephone response
from his appearance on that Burns Show...

1293
02:03:55,038 --> 02:03:57,373
...was the highest they've ever had.

1294
02:03:57,873 --> 02:03:58,791
And?

1295
02:04:00,126 --> 02:04:02,336
And it was 95 percent pro.

1296
02:04:02,962 --> 02:04:04,964
I'm certainly open to the idea.

1297
02:04:05,047 --> 02:04:09,343
It would be absolute lunacy
to support the President for another term.

1298
02:04:09,885 --> 02:04:13,431
That is exactly why I agree
with Ben's final wishes.

1299
02:04:15,977 --> 02:04:18,730
"I was born into a position
of extreme wealth.

1300
02:04:24,569 --> 02:04:26,945
"I have spent many sleepless nights...

1301
02:04:30,574 --> 02:04:32,576
"...thinking about extreme poverty.

1302
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:41,378
"I've lived a lot...

1303
02:04:42,129 --> 02:04:43,589
"...trembled a lot...

1304
02:04:44,298 --> 02:04:48,052
"...was surrounded by little men
who forgot that we enter naked...

1305
02:04:48,594 --> 02:04:49,928
"...and exit naked...

1306
02:04:50,012 --> 02:04:53,015
"...and that no accountant
can audit life in our favor."

1307
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:58,269
I do believe, gentlemen,
if we want to hold on to the Presidency...

1308
02:04:59,103 --> 02:05:03,608
...our one and only chance
is Chauncey Gardiner.

1309
02:05:09,033 --> 02:05:11,410
"When I was a boy, I was told...

1310
02:05:14,622 --> 02:05:17,583
"...that the Lord fashioned us
from his own image.

1311
02:05:19,835 --> 02:05:22,588
"That's when I decided
to manufacture mirrors.

1312
02:05:33,642 --> 02:05:34,810
"Security.

1313
02:05:37,312 --> 02:05:38,563
"Tranquility.

1314
02:05:44,486 --> 02:05:46,113
"A well-deserved rest.

1315
02:05:55,454 --> 02:05:57,500
"All the aims I have pursued...

1316
02:06:00,294 --> 02:06:02,088
"...will soon be realized.

1317
02:06:07,927 --> 02:06:09,012
"Life...

1318
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:14,434
"...is a state of mind."

1319
02:06:26,656 --> 02:06:27,907
I understand.

1320
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:33,747
Is it all clear there, boys?
Can you read that?

1321
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:41,338
What was the message, Mr. Gardiner?

1322
02:06:42,714 --> 02:06:44,674
"Now, get this, honky..."

1323
02:06:49,181 --> 02:06:50,890
Sorry, carry on.

1324
02:06:53,059 --> 02:06:53,976
Okay.

1325
02:06:58,648 --> 02:06:59,649
All set.

1326
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,611
What was the message, Mr. Gardiner?

1327
02:07:05,279 --> 02:07:07,490
"Now, get this, honky.

1328
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:11,579
"You go tell Raphael...

1329
02:07:12,163 --> 02:07:16,042
"...that I ain't taking no jive..."

1330
02:07:29,137 --> 02:07:30,138
Sorry.

1331
02:07:31,765 --> 02:07:34,518
"That I ain't taking no jive...

1332
02:07:35,352 --> 02:07:38,942
"...from no Western Union messenger.

1333
02:07:39,901 --> 02:07:43,697
"You tell that asshole if he..."

1334
02:07:49,284 --> 02:07:50,911
Did you see me going...

1335
02:07:52,663 --> 02:07:56,000
"Yes. You tell that asshole..."

1336
02:08:05,386 --> 02:08:06,345
Marker.

1337
02:08:06,971 --> 02:08:10,307
"Ain't taking no jive from no...

1338
02:08:11,142 --> 02:08:13,102
"...Western Union manager."

1339
02:08:13,686 --> 02:08:17,313
Messenger. Manager. What did I say?

1340
02:08:17,772 --> 02:08:18,732
Sorry.

1341
02:08:19,149 --> 02:08:22,861
"...from no Western Union messenger.

1342
02:08:24,571 --> 02:08:27,326
"You tell that asshole...

1343
02:08:28,243 --> 02:08:30,787
"...if he got something to tell me...

1344
02:08:31,496 --> 02:08:34,249
"...to get his ass down here."

1345
02:08:36,668 --> 02:08:37,669
Almost.

1346
02:08:44,176 --> 02:08:46,135
What was the message, Mr. Gardiner?

1347
02:08:47,678 --> 02:08:49,221
It's slightly long...

1348
02:08:50,848 --> 02:08:52,811
...but I will try to remember it.

1349
02:08:57,358 --> 02:08:59,818
"Now, get this, honky.

1350
02:09:01,111 --> 02:09:04,323
"You go tell Raphael...

1351

1355
02:09:21,466 --> 02:09:25,261
"...to get his ass down here himself."

1356
02:09:27,514 --> 02:09:28,807
Then he said...

1357
02:09:29,391 --> 02:09:34,396
...that I was to get my white ass
out of there quick or he'd cut it.
