1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,482
But it is an ingenious solution

2
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:05,678
And a final one

3
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:18,112
No

4
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:26,851
Ali, his cousin, laid there to die for him?
Who are we fighting?

5
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:35,629
They cannot go far, all the tracks are watched
We must take to the desert

6
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,787
Bakka will give 100 camels to the man

7
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:43,813
who brings back Muhammad
or his head

8
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:51,512
Look for 3 of them 
Muhammad, Abu Bakr and Uriqat, the Bidune guide

9
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:13,549
What is it?

10
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:20,965
These are drains of camel
Maybe two days, that from the city

11
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:29,432
Why are you here?

12
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,155
Medina is to the north

13
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,971
They made the tracks, not I

14
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,876
Know much? Traveling West?

15
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,945
I know my art

16
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:42,176
They say that you can track a bird by smelling the air

17
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:46,921
we go with him

18
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,799
he may be in that cave over there

19
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,475
Muhammad, if you come out, we will
take you to Mecca alive

20
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,014
Muhammad, come out

21
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:40,365
they cannot be in there
This web is unbroken

22
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:43,650
And these pigeons
they would not build

23
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:46,664
we were wrong to follow them
we should have gone north

24
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:49,557
Let's move then
we still have time to head them off

25
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:17,660
A few threads of a spider's web
was all that was then

26
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:23,268
between Muhammad and murder
But he was a man not to be killed

27
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:30,222
The Bidune guide led him 
and his companion Abu Bakr in their escape

28
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:35,220
through untracked spaces of the desert
and the heat of the June days

29
00:04:36,755 --> 00:04:39,405
At Medina, his followers waited with their welcome ready

30
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:43,007
but in great fear for his journey

31
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:13,773
anything? No nothing

32
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:17,605
this shows that he is only a man

33
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,044
no man can survive that heat

34
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:50,801
There! I see them! Look!

35
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:30,098
Run and hide! I might be obliged 
to free you as a gesture

36
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:45,900
Welcome to the city of Medina, the blessed,
your city, the messenger of god

37
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:00,880
You will stay with me, messenger of god,
I have the best house in Medina

38
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:04,197
you'll give me the honor of keeping you

39
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:05,713
Stay with me!

40
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:14,192
Please! Please! Please! How can the Prophet 
choose between so many welcomes?

41
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:19,897
Where God guides his camel to stop,
there he will build his house

42
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:20,835
All agreed

43
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:24,748
We turn Quaswa, his camel loose

44
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:28,608
and where Quaswa sits, the Prophet stays

45
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,782
Clever man!

46
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,303
A choice made by camel
can offend no one

47
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,910
Here we will build the house of the Prophet

48
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,680
And our first meeting place,
a prayer house

49
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,919
the first mosque of Islam, here!

50
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:26,263
God is great!
God is great!

51
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:06,193
What's got the prophet to start doing it?
carrying bricks?

52
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:16,340
Give me that Look, you are doing too much,
please go and sit down we will do it

53
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,979
Look! He went for more

54
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,778
"Work is a worship" he says

55
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,320
he's 53 years old

56
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,424
How old are you?

57
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:34,516
There is something missing.
Maybe a bell to call people in

58
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:36,979
the Christians use a bell

59
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:41,246
what about a horn, like the Jews?

60
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,789
A drum?

61
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,323
There's too much blood in a drum

62
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,557
Why not the human voice
as in Omar bin Kattab's vision?

63
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,757
The Prophet agrees?

64
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:58,931
he means you, Bilal

65
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,301
me?

66
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:05,169
You have a good voice, use it!
climb up there!

67
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:44,890


68
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:54,951


69
00:14:56,594 --> 00:15:05,466


70
00:15:07,003 --> 00:15:11,701


71
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:18,265


72
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:27,478


73
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,545


74
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:52,798
Brothers, today a man of Medina
will embrace a man of Mecca

75
00:15:52,807 --> 00:16:02,305
Each will share half and half,
reach out, embrace your neighbor and brother

76
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,619
I'm tired of the politics of kissing slaves

77
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:24,711
Read this

78
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:28,053
The prophet should concern himself with the after-world

79
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:34,589
What is my son?

80
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:37,393
Praying like a horse

81
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:48,492
does it burn your hands?
It's not upon us to burn down the house

82
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:51,737
he's making laws like a king.
He's declared that loyalty to Islam 

83
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:55,713
is more than loyalty to tribal family

84
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:55,985
What?

85
00:16:56,025 --> 00:17:01,337
All muslims are next of kin to one-another?

86
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:06,538
Don't be mislead by that...
They must change the nature of the tribes before that

87
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:12,106
The danger is here, the quality:
a man's neighbour is as good as himself

88
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:14,288
The Lunatic means it

89
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,319
Jews and Christians
have equal rights with Muslims,

90
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:21,072
the Jews who attach themselves to a common wealth
will be protected

91
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:26,004
Women have rights of inheritance... Rights

92
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,074
Next, he will be giving the camel rights

93
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:33,680
He has! the lunatic has!
You can't overload them

94
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:39,956
he's remaking a city, my city...

95
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:53,338
damn him..
He's taken our sons from us, he took the children, our future from us.
His rights are wrongs

96
00:17:53,372 --> 00:18:01,061
no more...
This time there will not be any regret

97
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:06,914
it will take everything of value they left in Mecca

98
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:16,140
their rugs, their houses, their silver
and with it, large of caravans to Damascus

99
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,763
My friends, listen to me!
I have news from Mecca

100
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:59,054
everything you have left behind is gone

101
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:05,190
the Thieves! Abu Bakr's shops,
the prophet's house... sold

102
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,131
Every cup or piece of cloth,
every rag or bone

103
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,875
you ever owned is thrown on the market

104
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:19,433
You are a people of nothing.
Don't you even fight for what you own?

105
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,046
Who talks of the fight?

106
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:26,298
What other way is there, Hamza?

107
00:19:29,183 --> 00:19:33,505
When the Prophet says Fight!,
we fight, now he says Peace!

108
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:35,673
Exactly

109
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:41,148
you are a peace loving people
up to your necks and fore bearers

110
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,353
go back to work!

111
00:20:04,312 --> 00:20:09,647
We have to defend ourselves.

112
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:15,167
You are the Messenger of god.
Yet, they mock, abuse and plunder us and we do nothing

113
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:18,945
In the pathage of war, we are pathetic

114
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:25,955
But they are led by greed, we are
led by god and you

115
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:36,033
I know how you hate the sword, but
we have to fight

116
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:49,008
they've stolen our property, they are taking it to Damascus

117
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:55,852
right past our own door our door.
I say, by God turn back

118
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:20,925
I'm sorry I got carried away

119
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,226
Its pounding in my head

120
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:32,235
Please, fight them!

121
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:15,801
But look at the sun!

122
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:26,484
It's not the time of prayer

123
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:56,035
It is newly revealed by god to his messenger

124
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:02,546
Fight, but fight in the way of god
against those who fight against you

125
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,002
Drive them out of the places from where they drove you out,


126
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:08,860
for persecution is worse than slaughter

127
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:14,945
Fight them until persecution is no more

128
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:20,132
and religion is God,
but if they stop, let there be no more war

129
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,315
for god never loves the slaughters of wars

130
00:23:26,344 --> 00:23:30,814
so, fight in the way of god
against those who fight against you

131
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:38,950
God is great!
God is great!
God is great!
God is great!

132
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:25,161
These are the disciplines that the Prophet
puts upon you

133
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:31,491
you may not harm a woman, a child or any old person! 

134
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:35,803
you may not harm cripples

135
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:39,543
you may not harm the man that works in the field

136
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,281
You may not cut down trees

137
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:47,407
Strike only at those who have expelled you

138
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:52,503
who have stolen your rights and
riched themselves with your possession!

139
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,765
now, to the wells of Badr

140
00:25:12,431 --> 00:25:14,933
News from Medina!

141
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:20,152
Arms... Arm yourself... Arm yourself...

142
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:23,283
defend your wealth

143
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,292
Muhammad has come out of Medina to attack the great caravan

144
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,485
- How many men?
-300 Two horses

145
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:32,684
- We have more than 100 horses
How many camels?

146
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,445
- 17
- We will bring 117

147
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:39,071
- And wine, 
20 of mine with wine..
we will make a feast of it

148
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,371
That is a war I'd like to fight

149
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:44,410
a war we can not lose!

150
00:26:28,193 --> 00:26:31,184
ride to Abu Sufian's caravan.
tell him to turn towards Badr

151
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,784
We will join forces tomorrow
near sources of Beder

152
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:36,637
Wells of Badr... here

153
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:41,342
Muhammad's march... here

154
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:46,107
my charge of the caravan.... here
One day's march...

155
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:50,943
meet them at the wells

156
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:57,749
I don't like it

157
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:03,790
There is too much of Mecca on my caravan to be risked

158
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:11,170
put out the fires...
hold the camels...

159
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:23,762
We are turning west, away from the wells

160
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:28,607
away?
you can't...

161
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:31,245
You must meet them at Badr

162
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:34,464
we can bring them down like raw eggs

163
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,868
- If I run all night, I'll be out of 
Muhammad's reach by morning

164
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,319
Where is your honor, Abu Sufian?

165
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:44,342
Honor?

166
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:50,082
- My honor's on the backs of my camels
Yes, I run...

167
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:44,475
Muhammad has occupied the wells

168
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:48,350
- he has moved directly into our line of march

169
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:11,971
- Abu Sufian has broken camp
He's moving west, away from Badr

170
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,821
- The Caravan is safe
So, there is no need to fight

171
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:18,642
not fight?

172
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:22,542
- If we fight, we will start blood feuds between brothers

173
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,845
between father and son, you mean

174
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,793
Hudaifa, your own son is with them.
He should have been with....

175
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:36,132
Mecca is greater than your family

176
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:41,432
Walid, your second son.
he is your true blood

177
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:47,204
I say: Fight! We stand in the present
and the future will look after itself

178
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:55,413
Utbah is not a coward

179
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:05,318
we will finish them tomorrow. 
We fight! we fight!

180
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,045
are you finished?

181
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,469
All right! Take your positions!

182
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:47,437
Each man to his own place

183
00:34:58,843 --> 00:34:59,831
Go back to your columns

184
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:01,159
move it. move back

185
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:11,600
So Muhammad's filled the wells

186
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:16,410
Now everyone will have to fight for this

187
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:17,742
we fight

188
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:32,826
Brothers! we hold the wells

189
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:37,560
we stand in the name of god and his messenger.
we wait

190
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:32,367
BATTLE OF BADR......

Send us your champions

191
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,977
Who are you?

192
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:51,319
we expect our peers and our equals

193
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:55,383
Come back!

194
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:08,636
my brother, Shaiba 
my son Walid 
and myself

195
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:24,285
Not you! Ubaida and I and Ali

196
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:24,662
Are we your equals?

197
00:38:25,979 --> 00:38:30,301
There is only one God and
Muhammad is His messenger

198
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:07,648
Archers! Advance!

199
00:40:11,298 --> 00:40:13,652
Archers!

200
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:24,458
Still! stretch!

201
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,602
stretch

202
00:40:48,295 --> 00:40:49,546
stretch

203
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:06,055
Archers!

204
00:41:12,548 --> 00:41:14,129
Archers back...

205
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:32,651
they are regrouping

206
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,213
forward!

207
00:41:39,504 --> 00:41:40,390
ready

208
00:41:41,605 --> 00:41:42,788
Lancers!

209
00:42:02,488 --> 00:42:03,978
God is great!

210
00:42:09,328 --> 00:42:12,876
Attack! God is great!

211
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:59,516
Umaya!

212
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,494
Umaya!

213
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,658
Bilal!

214
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:44,559
God is great!

215
00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:58,017
God is great!

216
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:09,787
The Prophet is seeing you! 
You are not to rob or try to perish this

217
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:18,913
And if a rogue does, cut him loose.
I said, cut them loose
and give them water 

218
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:28,061
and share your food, equal mouth-fulls.
And if they walk, walk beside them

219
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:36,311
Any prisoner who can teach 10 Muslims
to read will go free

220
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:07,075
Why don't they go away?

221
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:10,670
Because, they blame me Hind,
whatever it is, good or bad

222
00:46:11,926 --> 00:46:14,814
I should have joined them
and drown in the wells of bitter with them

223
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:17,546
But, I saved the caravan and our future with it

224
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:22,819
The sing at me?

225
00:46:22,868 --> 00:46:26,257
Why sing my father and my brother is not with me?

226
00:46:26,304 --> 00:46:29,523
Do you think I need you to remind me?

227
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:46,948
Muhammad, Ali, Hamza!
With my nails, Hamza,

228
00:46:46,955 --> 00:47:02,312
I will give you mesher and mesher, with my nails...
killer, cut throater, butcher

229
00:47:02,334 --> 00:47:06,201
murdering beast, you slaughtered my father

230
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:14,961
Hamza! I will hunt, like a lion

231
00:47:14,977 --> 00:47:26,102
I will make Hamza, my lion, my prey.
And when you are dead Hamza, 
I will cut your heart out, 

232
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:30,942
taste the blood, cut in pieces

233
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:35,006
I forbit this weiling.
this cannot go on

234
00:47:36,528 --> 00:47:39,361
What we should do, we will do

235
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:43,231
we will call in our allies, 
lead the new one against them

236
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,349
This time, we will prepare it.
We'll plan it

237
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:56,693
Hamza!

238
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:15,786
come to prayer...
come to prayer...

239
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:27,052
come to victory...
come to victory...

240
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:37,160
God is great

241
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:43,094
There is no god only God

242
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:26,897
Is it a plague?

243
00:49:28,386 --> 00:49:32,071
what kind of an upside down town have we come in to?

244
00:49:35,826 --> 00:49:39,113
You could fill your pockets very nicely here

245
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,615
No merchant is minding his shop

246
00:49:43,665 --> 00:49:45,587
God is minding the shop

247
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:48,990
where do you come from?

248
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:50,450
Yemen

249
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:53,063
did you stop in Mecca?

250
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:56,860
It is on the road

251
00:49:57,877 --> 00:49:59,332
you didn't answer my question

252
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:01,498
did you stop in Mecca?

253
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:04,836
long enough to rest my camels

254
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:08,966
Camels rest better in Mecca
than anywhere in the world

255
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,705
Yes What is the word on the desert?

256
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:16,509
Oh... It is bad for you

257
00:50:17,627 --> 00:50:23,019
they are gathering..
Each young man with a sword is on his way to Mecca

258
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,353
Our strength is here

259
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:36,468
Do not underestimate them.
they are summoning up their courage.
In Mecca there is music in every house

260
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,086
Abbisinian slave, watch him, he is good, vicious, watch him

261
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:15,587
I'll free you. give you your weight in silver,

262
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:20,759
and your height in silk
for one throw like this

263
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:45,719
So they've come at last
We'll know how many soon enough

264
00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:05,294
It's a big army

265
00:54:05,346 --> 00:54:08,735
3,000 men, hundreds of horses

266
00:54:08,782 --> 00:54:10,534
I bet them at Badr

267
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,073
That was a year ago

268
00:54:12,185 --> 00:54:14,733
They've come to revenge Badr

269
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,737
Go and get your swords!

270
00:54:46,646 --> 00:54:52,299
Soldiers of Mecca!
Blood master blood

271
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:55,865
avenge the dead of Badr
