00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,500
Harry, answer that.

3
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,700
So, what do you want to hack for, Bickle?
I can't sleep nights.

4
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,500
- There's porno theaters for that.
- I know. I tried that.

5
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,100
So what do you do now?

6
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,000
Ride around nights mostly.
Subways, buses.

7
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,100
Figured if I'm gonna do that,
I might as well get paid for it.

8
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,700
Wanna work uptown nights,
South Bronx, Harlem?

9
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,000
- I'll work anytime, anywhere.
- Will you work Jewish holidays?
Anytime, anywhere.

10
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Let me see your chauffeur's license.

11
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,600
<i>- Give me one cab.</i>
- How's your driving record?

12
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,800
It's clean, real clean, like my conscience.

13
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you gonna break my chops?
Got trouble with guys like you
breaking my chops.

14
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,800
If you're gonna break my chops,
you can take it on the arches. Understand?

15
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,200
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
- Physical?
- Clean.

17
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
- Age?
- Twenty-six.

18
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,200
Education?

19
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,000
Some.

20
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,600
Here, there, you know.
<i>Hey, Horowitz!</i>

21
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Military record?

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,900
Honorable discharge...

23
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,300
May 1973.

24
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,400
- Were you in the army?
- Marines.

25
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,200
I was in the Marines, too.

26
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,900
So what is it? You need an extra job?

27
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,700
Are you moonlighting?

28
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,500
I just want to work long hours.
What's moonlighting?

29
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,000
Look, just fill out these forms and
check back tomorrow when the shift breaks.

30
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,500
<i>O'Brien, please step up.</i>

31
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,900
Take the car out to 58th Street, please,
'cause it's crowded on 57th.

32
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,800
All right, I'm coming down there.

33
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,300
Let's go.

34
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,100
<i>May 10.</i>

35
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
<i>Thank God for the rain</i>
<i>which has helped wash away...</i>

36
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,200
<i>the garbage and trash off the sidewalks.</i>

37
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
<i>I'm working long hours now.</i>

38
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,500
<i>6:00 in the afternoon</i>
<i>to 6:00 in the morning...</i>

39
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,400
<i>sometimes even 8:00 in the morning.</i>

40
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,300
<i>Six days a week,</i>
<i>sometimes seven days a week.</i>

41
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,700
<i>It's a long hustle, but it keeps me real busy.</i>

42
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,300
<i>I can take in $300, $350 a week...</i>

43
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,100
<i>sometimes even more</i>
<i>when I do it off the meter.</i>

44
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,500
<i>All the animals come out at night.</i>

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,700
<i>Whores, skunk pussies, buggers,</i>
<i>queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.</i>

46
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,900
<i>Sick, venal.</i>

47
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,600
<i>Someday a real rain'll come</i>
<i>and wash this scum off the streets.</i>

48
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,300
<i>I go all over. I take people to the Bronx,</i>
<i>Brooklyn, I take them to Harlem.</i>

49
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,000
<i>I don't care. Don't make no difference to me.</i>

50
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,400
<i>It does to some.</i>
<i>Some won't even take spooks.</i>

51
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,100
<i>Don't make no difference to me.</i>
Driver, 48th and 6th please.

52
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Man, you're a gorgeous, brown,
beautiful little girl.

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,800
- I can't afford to get stopped anywhere.
- No, we wouldn't want that to happen.

54
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,400
There'll be a big tip in it for you,
if you do the right things.
You got a way.

55
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
Yeah, now you're talking.

56
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,500
Driver, hurry up, will you?

57
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Yeah, it's gonna be fine.

58
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,600
<i>Each night when I return the cab</i>
<i>to the garage...</i>

59
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,000
<i>I have to clean the come off the back seat.</i>

60
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
<i>Some nights I clean out the blood.</i>

61
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Can I help you?

62
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,400
Yeah, what's your name?

63
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,500
- My name is Travis.
- That's nice. What can I do for you?

64
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,700
I'd like to know what your name is.
What's your name?

65
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,600
Give me a break.
You can tell me what your name is.
I'm not gonna do anything.

66
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,500
- Do you want me to call the manager?
- You don't have to, I'm just asking...

67
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,900
- Troy!
- All right, okay.

68
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,200
Can I have a chuckles there?

69
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,200
You have any jujubes? They last longer.
I'd like to get some.

70
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,600
What you see is what we got.

71
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,900
I'll take these.

72
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,700
Coca-Cola.

73
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,400
We don't have Coca-Cola.
Royal Crown Cola is all we got.

74
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
$1.85.

75
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,700
<i>Twelve hours of work, and I still can't sleep.</i>

76
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
<i>Damn!</i>

77
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,200
<i>The days go on and on.</i>

78
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,800
<i>They don't end.</i>

79
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,700
<i>All my life needed</i>
<i>was a sense of some place to go.</i>

80
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,700
<i>I don't believe that one should devote</i>
<i>his life to morbid self-attention.</i>

81
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,500
<i>I believe that someone should become</i>
<i>a person like other people.</i>

82
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,900
<i>I first saw her at Palantine Campaign</i>
<i>Headquarters at 63rd and Broadway.</i>

83
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,100
<i>She was wearing a white dress.</i>

84
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,000
<i>She appeared like an angel.</i>

85
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,600
<i>Out of this filthy mess...</i>

86
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
<i>she is alone.</i>

87
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,300
<i>They cannot...</i>

88
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,100
<i>touch her.</i>

89
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,900
Yes, well...

90
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,300
you delivered two boxes.
I think it's a total of 5,000 campaign buttons.

91
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,000
Now, on all the ones we had before,
our slogan is "We are the people"...

92
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,300
and "are" is underlined.
These new buttons have "we" underlined.

93
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,800
That reads "We are the people."

94
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,300
Well, I think there's a difference.

95
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,100
"We are the people" is not the same as
"We are the people."

96
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,100
Let's not fight.

97
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,600
Look, we'll make it real simple.

98
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,300
We don't pay for the buttons.
We throw the buttons away, all right?

99
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,200
Come here a minute.

100
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,100
What?

101
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,300
This canvas report is ready. If Andy okays it,
send copies to headquarters...

102
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,500
I got to get that <i>New York Times</i>
article Xeroxed. That has to be...

103
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,100
- Don't forget the new photos.
- I didn't forget. Look...

104
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,800
We have to emphasize
the Mandatory Welfare Program.

105
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,500
- That's the issue that should be pushed.
- First push the man, then the issue.

106
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,300
Sen. Palantine is a dynamic man.
An intelligent, interesting, fresh...

107
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,600
- You forgot sexy.
- I did not forget sexy.

108
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,600
Listen to yourself.
You sound like you're selling mouthwash.

109
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,500
- We are selling mouthwash.
- Are we authorized to do that?
Very funny.

110
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,900
We can get in trouble selling
pharmaceuticals in a campaign office.

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,500
My uncle's in jail because of that.

112
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,000
It's not really jail.
Living with his wife, anything would be jail.

113
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,500
- Look over there.
- I love you.

114
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,900
- Notice anything?
- No.

115
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
- Put your glasses on.
- Okay. Just a minute.

116
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,700
- All right.
- That taxi driver's been staring at us.

117
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,600
- What taxi driver?
- That one. The one that's sitting there.

118
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,700
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know, but it feels like a long time.

119
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,900
- Does he bother you?
- No.

120
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,600
You really mean yes,
and you're being sarcastic.

121
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,900
- You're quick. You're really quick.
- I try to be real quick.

122
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,600
Tell you what.
I'll play the male in this relationship.

123
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,200
- I'll go out...
- Good luck.
And tell him to move.

124
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,000
- And I don't need good luck. Thank you.
- Yes, you do. You just think you don't.

125
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,000
You're blocking our doorway.
You think you might wanna move the cab?

126
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,200
You know, eye shadow, mascara...

127
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,600
lipstick, rouge.
Not rouge. "Blush-on" they call it.

128
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,900
- The kind with the brush.
- Yeah. It's blush-on.

129
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
- Travis!
- Wiz.

130
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,300
That's blush-on. My wife uses it.

131
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,300
Ask Travis. He's a ladies' man.

132
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,500
A cup of coffee, please.
Anyway, whatever the fuck it is,
she uses a lot of it, you know.

133
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,800
Then perfume, the spray kind.

134
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,700
Get this.
In the middle of the Triborough bridge...

135
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
and this woman is beautiful,
she changes her pantyhose.

136
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,700
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

137
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,900
- What did you do?
- I threw the meter, you know.

138
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,700
I jump in the backseat, whip it out,
and I say, "You know what this is?"

139
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,400
She says, "It's love." I'm gonna
fuck her brains out. She goes wild.

140
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,600
And she said, "It's the greatest
single experience of my life."

141
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,400
She gave me a $200 tip
and her phone number in Acapulco.

142
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,100
Travis, you know Doughboy, Charlie T?

143
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,000
Hey, Travis, got change for a nickel?

144
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,700
We call him Doughboy
'cause he'll do anything for a buck.

145
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,900
So, how's it hanging?

146
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
What's that?

147
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,700
I just heard on the radio some fleet driver
from Bell just got all cut up.

148
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,400
- Stickup?
- No, he got cut up by some crazy fucker.

149
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,700
- Cut half his ear off.
- Where?
They said 122nd Street.

150
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,700
Fucking Mau Mau land.

151
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
You run all over town, don't you?

152
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,000
Travis?

153
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
- You run all over town, don't you?
- Yeah.

154
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,000
I mean,
you handled some pretty rough customers.
Yeah, I have.

155
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
- You carry a piece?
- No.

156
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,300
- You need one?
- No.

157
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,400
If you ever need one, I know a fellow
who can get you a real nice deal.

158
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,300
Lots of shit around.

159
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,900
I never use mine. I'm conservative.

160
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,300
But it's a good thing to have just as a threat.

161
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
I'm gonna go do my dirt.

162
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,700
Travis.

163
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,800
Look.

164
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,200
A piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub.

165
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,400
Dig the symbols.

166
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,100
"F- 4-0-5-4-3-4"

167
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
The watermark.

168
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,100
There's one person.

169
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,900
There's two persons,
and there's three persons.

170
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,300
I got this at his estate, The Pines.

171
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,500
Why don't you take it? If you can sell it,
you give me half of what you got.

172
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,500
I don't want it.

173
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,600
I'm gonna get in my cab and boogie.

174
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,900
- I'm terribly sorry.
- What now?

175
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,800
- Nothing!
- That's very cute. Thank you.

176
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,400
Hey, you want to see something?

177
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,000
Wait. I just typed,
"You want to see something?"

178
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
- What?
- lf you had...

179
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,500
these three fingers missing on this hand
and that hand missing on that hand...

180
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,900
how would you light a match?
- I wouldn't light a match.
- Go ahead, give it a try.

181
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,400
Well, I don't think I could do it.
No?

182
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
It's gonna be difficult. I'll give it a try.

183
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
I got my thumb back for a second.
Thank God.

184
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,500
Just a minute.

185
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,300
I can't do it.

186
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,900
- The guy at the newsstand can do it.
- I don't work at a newsstand.

187
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,900
- He's probably Italian.
- No.

188
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,700
- You sure he's not Italian?
- He's black.

189
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,100
If he had been Italian,
he might have been a thief.

190
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,500
They do that.
The mob does that a lot of times.

191
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,400
If a thief screws up on the job,
they'll blow his fingers off.

192
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,200
I'll tell you something else.
It's like a joke, but true.

193
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,300
If they kill a stool pigeon,
they leave a canary on the body.

194
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,800
- Apparently it's symbolic.
- Why not a pigeon instead of a canary?

195
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,700
I don't know why not a pigeon.
Wait a minute.

196
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,000
You got to catch a pigeon.
A canary, you can walk into a pet store.

197
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
As long as you pay for it, boom.

198
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,400
Kill it right there. Put it on anyone you want.
Doesn't matter.

199
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,300
- Hi. I'd like to volunteer.
- Great. I'll take you over here.

200
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,500
I'd rather volunteer to her, if you don't mind.

201
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,300
Why do you feel that
you have to volunteer to me?

202
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Because I think you are
the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

203
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,000
Thanks. But what do you think of Palantine?

204
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,200
Charles Palantine, the man you're
volunteering to help elect President.

205
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm sure he'll make a good president.
I don't know his policies...

206
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,800
but I'm sure he'll make a good one.

207
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,500
- You want to canvass?
- I'll canvass.

208
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,200
How do you feel about
the Senator's stand on welfare?

209
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,900
I don't know the Senator's stand on welfare,
but I'm sure it's a good stand.

210
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,500
- Are you sure of that?
- Yeah.

211
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,100
We all work together here full-time,
day and night.

212
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,500
If you would step over there,
I'm sure the gentleman will sign you up.

213
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,000
I drive a taxi at night, so it's hard for me...

214
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,400
to work in the day.

215
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Then what exactly do you want?
Would you like to come
have some coffee and pie with me?

216
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,000
Why?

217
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,600
Why? I'll tell you why.

218
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,000
I think you're a lonely person.

219
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,100
I drive by this place a lot,
and I see you here.
I see a lot of people around you...

220
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,900
and I see all these phones
and stuff on your desk.
That means nothing.

221
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,800
Then I came inside and met you...
I saw in your eyes,
I saw the way you carried yourself...

222
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,200
that you're not a happy person.

223
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,800
I think you need something.
If you want to call it a friend,
you can call it a friend.

224
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,200
- You're gonna be my friend?
- Yeah.

225
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
What do you say?

226
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,800
It's a little hard standing here
and asking you, so...

227
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,100
Five minutes. That's all.
Just outside, right around here.

228
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm there to protect you.

229
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,400
Come on. Just take a little break.

230
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,600
I have a break at 4:00, and if you're here...
- 4:00 today?
- Yes.

231
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,700
- I'll be here.
- I'm sure you will.

232
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,000
- All right. 4:00 p. m?
- Right.

233
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,900
- Outside, in the front?
- Yes.
Okay. My name is Travis. Betsy?

234
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,800
- Travis.
- Yeah.

235
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,700
I appreciate this, Betsy.

236
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,900
<i>May 26, 4:00 p.m.</i>

237
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,200
<i>I took Betsy to Child's Coffee Shop</i>
<i>on Columbus Circle.</i>

238
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,000
<i>I had black coffee and apple pie</i>
<i>with a slice of melted yellow cheese.</i>

239
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
<i>I think that was a good selection.</i>

240
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,500
<i>Betsy had coffee and a fruit salad dish.</i>
<i>But she could've had anything she wanted.</i>

241
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,800
15,000 volunteers in New York alone
is not bad...
but, Christ, the organizational problems.

242
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,700
I know what you mean.
I got the same problems.

243
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,400
I got to get organized.
You know, little things
like my apartment, my possessions.

244
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,700
I should get a sign saying,
"One of these days I'll get organezized."

245
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,900
- You mean organized?
- "Organeziezd."

246
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,000
Organeziezd. It's a joke.

247
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,800
O-R-G-A-N-E-Z-I-E-Z-D.

248
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,400
You mean organezized
like those office signs that say "thimk."

249
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,800
Do you like the place you work in?

250
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,900
We've got some good people
working for us...
and I think Palantine's got a good chance.

251
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,600
You know, you have beautiful eyes.

252
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,100
- Do you like the guy you work with?
- He's okay.

253
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,800
Yeah, but do you like him?

254
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,500
He's funny, and he's very good at his job.
He's okay.

255
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,400
- Though he does have a few problems.
- I would say he has quite a few problems.

256
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,100
His energy seems to go in the wrong places.

257
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,500
When I walked in
and saw you two sitting there...

258
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,200
I could tell by the way you both related
there was no connection whatsoever.

259
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,900
And I felt when I walked in
that there was something between us.

260
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,900
There was an impulse
that we were both following.

261
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,500
So that gave me the right
to come in and talk to you.

262
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Otherwise, I never would have felt
I had the right to talk to you...

263
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,900
or say anything to you.
I never would have had the courage
to talk to you.

264
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,300
With him, I felt there was nothing,
and I could sense it.

265
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,200
When I walked in, I knew I was right.
Did you feel that way?

266
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,300
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

267
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,700
- Where are you from?
- Upstate.

268
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,800
That fellow you work with, I don't like him.

269
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,200
Not that I don't like him.
I just think he's silly.

270
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,300
I don't think he respects you.

271
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,800
I don't believe I've ever met anyone
quite like you.

272
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,600
You wanna go to a movie with me?

273
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,100
- I have to go back to work.
- I don't mean now. Like another time?

274
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,100
Sure. You know what you remind me of?

275
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,300
- What?
- That song.

276
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,900
By Kris Kristofferson.

277
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,900
- Who's that?
- The songwriter.

278
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,800
He's a prophet and a pusher.

279
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,000
Partly truth, partly fiction.
A walking contradiction.

280
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,600
- You saying that about me?
- Who else would I be talking about?

281
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm no pusher. I never have pushed.

282
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,800
No, just the part about the contradictions.
You are that.

283
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,200
<i>I called Betsy again at her office,</i>
<i>and she said...</i>

284
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,800
<i>maybe we'd go to a movie</i>
<i>after she gets off work tomorrow.</i>

285
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,400
<i>That's my day off. At first she hesitated.</i>

286
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,800
<i>But I called her again and then she agreed.</i>

287
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,500
<i>Betsy. No, Betsy what?</i>
<i>I forgot to ask her last name again.</i>

288
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,800
<i>Damn. I got to remember stuff like that.</i>

289
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,700
I don't think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves...

290
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,500
I don't think we have to worry about
anybody here committing themselves...

291
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,900
until things start coming in from California.

292
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,200
This is just making me nervous.
We should have waited for the limo.

293
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,300
I don't mind taking a cab, but I mind going
to California without preparing right.

294
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,000
- That's gonna get us in trouble.
- Are you Charles Palantine, the candidate?

295
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,100
Yes, I am.

296
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,700
I'm one of your biggest supporters.

297
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,400
I tell everybody that comes in this taxi
that they have to vote for you.
Why, thank you...

298
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,800
Travis.

299
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm sure you're gonna win, sir.
Everybody I know is gonna vote for you.

300
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,900
In fact, I was gonna put one
of your stickers in my taxi.

301
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,600
But the company said it was against
their policy, they don't know anything.

302
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,200
- They're a bunch of jerks.
- Let me tell you something...

303
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,300
I have learned more about America
from riding in taxi cabs...

304
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,000
than in all the limos in the country.

305
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,200
- Yeah?
- That's true.

306
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,700
- Can I ask you something, Travis?
- Sure.

307
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,100
What is the one thing about this country
that bugs you the most?

308
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,000
Well, I don't know.
I don't follow political issues that closely.

309
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
There must be something.

310
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Whatever it is,
you should clean up this city here...

311
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,700
because this city is like an open sewer,
it's full of filth and scum.

312
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,300
Sometimes I can hardly take it.
Whoever becomes the President
should just...

313
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,100
really clean it up, know what I mean?

314
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,700
Sometimes I go out and I smell it.
I get headaches, it's so bad.

315
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,100
It's like, they just never go away, you know.

316
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,400
The President should just
clean up this whole mess here.

317
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,700
He should flush it right down
the fucking toilet.

318
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,300
I think I know what you mean, Travis.

319
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,600
But it's not gonna be easy.

320
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,400
- We'll have to make some radical changes.
- Damn straight.

321
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,100
- Here you go, Travis. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

322
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,200
- Nice talking to you, Travis.
- Nice talking to you, sir.

323
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,500
You're a good man.
I know you're gonna win.
Thank you.

324
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Come on, man. Get me out of here, all right?

325
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,300
Come on!

326
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,600
Come on, baby. This is a real drag.
Don't make no scene.

327
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,200
You wanna get busted?
What's up, bitch, be cool!

328
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,400
Don't start no trouble.

329
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,500
Cabbie, forget about this. It's nothing.
Be cool, bitch.

330
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
Get your ass out of here.

331
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,100
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

332
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,200
- Did you have a nice day today?
- Not particularly.
Got a present for you.

333
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,700
Now back to Gene Krupa's
syncopated style shortly.

334
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,200
Why'd you do that?
What else am I gonna do with my money?

335
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,600
I wish you would've listened to this.

336
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,600
I would've, except my record player
doesn't work now.

337
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Your stereo's broken? How can you
stand it? I couldn't live without music.

338
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,800
I don't follow music too much.
But I would really like to. I really would.

339
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,000
- Then you haven't heard this record yet.
- No.

340
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,500
But I was thinking, maybe we could listen
to it on your record player.

341
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,700
Now going back to 40 years of Chick Webb.

342
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,000
- You've got to be kidding.
- Why?

343
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
This is a dirty movie.

344
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,400
No, this is a movie that...

345
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,900
a lot of couples come to,
all kinds of couples go here.

346
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,700
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I see them all the time.

347
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,200
Come on.

348
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
Excuse me!

349
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,500
Shut the fuck up.

350
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,900
- Where are you going?
- I have to leave now.
Why?

351
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,700
I don't know why I came in here.
I don't like these movies.

352
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,000
I didn't know you'd feel that way
about this movie.

353
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,200
- I don't know much about movies...
- This the only kind you go to?

354
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,200
Yeah, I come. This is not so bad.

355
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,700
Taking me to this place is about
as exciting as you saying, "Let's fuck."

356
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,000
There are other places,
plenty of other movies I can take you to.

357
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,700
I don't know much about them,
but I can take you to other places.
We're just different.

358
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,500
- Wait a second.
- I have to go.

359
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,800
- I've got to go now.
- I wanna talk to you.

360
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,200
- I have to go.
- Wait a second.

361
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,300
Taxi!

362
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,700
Can't I talk to you at least?
Won't you talk to me? I didn't know...

363
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,800
- Look, won't you take the record?
- I've already got it.

364
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,700
But, please. I bought it for you, Betsy.

365
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,200
Thanks. Now I've got two. Let's go.

366
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,700
Can I call you?

367
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,300
Jesus Christ. I got a taxi.

368
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,700
Hello, Betsy. Hi, it's Travis.

369
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,000
How you doing?
Listen, I'm sorry about the other night.

370
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,000
I didn't know that's how you felt about it.

371
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,900
I didn't know that was the way you felt.
I would've taken you somewhere else.

372
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,200
Are you feeling better or...

373
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,300
Maybe you had a virus or something,
24-hour virus.

374
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,600
It can happen. Yeah.

375
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,300
You've been working hard.
I know it's... Yeah...

376
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,500
Okay.

377
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Would you like to have
some dinner with me...

378
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,600
in the next few days or something?

379
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,500
How about just a cup of coffee?
I could come by the headquarters.
We could...

380
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,000
Okay.

381
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
Did you get my flowers in the...

382
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,800
You didn't get them? I sent some flowers...

383
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,400
Yeah, okay.

384
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,900
Can I call you again tomorrow
or the next day?

385
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,900
Okay. No, I'm gonna... Yeah, sure, okay.

386
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,000
So long.

387
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,500
<i>I tried several times to call her,</i>
<i>but after the first call...</i>

388
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,800
<i>she wouldn't come to the phone any longer.</i>

389
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,100
<i>I also sent flowers, but with no luck.</i>

390
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,100
<i>The smell of the flowers</i>
<i>only made me sicker.</i>

391
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,500
<i>The headaches got worse.</i>
<i>I think I got stomach cancer.</i>

392
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,000
<i>I shouldn't complain, though.</i>

393
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,400
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

394
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,800
<i>You're only as healthy as you feel.</i>

395
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,300
<i>You're only as healthy...</i>

396
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,100
<i>as you feel.</i>

397
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
Thank you very much.

398
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,100
Let's not have any trouble, okay?

399
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,600
What? Why won't you talk to me,
or answer my calls when I call?

400
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,600
- You think I don't know you're here?
- Let's not have trouble.

401
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,300
- Please leave.
- Get your hands off me.

402
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,300
- Okay, then leave.
- Know that I know.

403
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Let's not have any trouble. Please.
This is no place to do this.

404
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,700
- Get your hands off me!
- Okay, just leave.

405
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,700
- Take them off!
- All right! Just leave now. Come on.

406
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,700
You're in a hell, and you're gonna die
in a hell like the rest of them!

407
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,400
- There's a cop across the street.
- You're like them.
I'm calling the cop. Officer!

408
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,300
Look. Don't come around here
because I'll call the police!

409
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,300
<i>I realize now how much</i>
<i>she's just like the others.</i>

410
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,700
<i>Cold and distant.</i>
<i>And many people are like that.</i>

411
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,100
<i>Women for sure. They're like a union.</i>

412
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Cab!

413
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,000
Pull over to the curb over there.

414
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,700
No, don't...

415
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,700
The fucking meter. What are you doing?
What are you doing with the meter?

416
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,600
Did I tell you to do that with the meter?

417
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,800
Put the meter back, let the numbers go on.

418
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,600
I don't care what I have to pay.
I'm not getting out.
Put the meter back on.

419
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,500
Put it down.

420
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,900
That's right. Put it down.

421
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,100
Why are you writing?
Don't write! Put the thing down. Just sit.

422
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,500
I didn't tell you to write.
I just said, "Pull over to the curb."

423
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,000
We've pulled over to the curb.
We're gonna sit here.

424
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,700
We're gonna sit.

425
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,700
Cabbie, you see that light up there?
The window?

426
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,200
The light, the window
up there on the second floor.

427
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,800
The one that's closest
to the edge of the building.

428
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,700
The light up in the window, second story.

429
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,800
What, are you blind?

430
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,700
Do you see the light?

431
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,900
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you see it. Good.

432
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,800
See the woman in the window?

433
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,800
Do you see the woman in the window?

434
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,100
Yeah.

435
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,300
You see the woman. Good.

436
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,800
I want you to see that woman
because that's my wife.

437
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,000
But that's not my apartment.

438
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,700
It's not my apartment.
You know who lives there?

439
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,500
You wouldn't know. I'm just saying...
But you know who lives there?

440
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,100
A nigger lives there. How do you like that?

441
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,700
I'm gonna kill her.

442
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,900
There's nothing else. I'm just gonna kill her.
What do you think of that?

443
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,600
I said, what do you think of that?

444
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,300
Don't answer.

445
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,200
You don't have to answer everything.

446
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,700
I'm gonna kill her with a.44 magnum pistol.

447
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,200
I have a.44 magnum pistol.
I'm gonna kill her with that gun.

448
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,700
Did you ever see what a.44 magnum
would do to a woman's face?

449
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,300
It'll fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

450
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,200
That's what it can do to her face.

451
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,400
Did you see what it can do
to a woman's pussy? That you should see.

452
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,800
You should see what a.44 magnum's
gonna do to a woman's pussy.

453
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,200
What's that?

454
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,400
I know you must think I'm...

455
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,200
You must think I'm pretty sick or something.

456
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,300
Right? You think I'm pretty sick?

457
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,300
Right? I bet you really think I'm sick.

458
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,200
You think I'm sick?

459
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,300
You don't have to answer that.
I'm paying for the ride.

460
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,400
I picked up this midget.
He was very well dressed.

461
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,900
Italian suit. Good-looking.
Had a beautiful tall blonde.
A lady midget?

462
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,800
No, the guy was a midget.
The blonde was the lady.

463
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,600
- I got it.
- Those midgets are funny.

464
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,600
- Sometimes I like to hold a midget.
- Yeah?

465
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,300
They're funny. They always want
to sit in the front seat.

466
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,800
Then I pick up these two fags.
They're going downtown.

467
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,500
They're wearing these rhinestone t-shirts.
They start arguing.

468
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,500
They start yelling.
The other says, "You bitch!"
And starts beating him on the head.

469
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,300
I say, "Look, I don't care what you do
in the privacy of your own home...

470
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,600
"behind closed doors.

471
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,600
"This is an American free country.
We've got a pursuit of happiness thing.

472
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,300
"You're consenting. You're adult.
"But in my fucking cab...

473
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,700
"don't go busting heads."
You know what I mean?

474
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,900
"God loves you. Do what you want."
Tell them to go to California.

475
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,400
In California, when two fags split up,
one's got to pay the other alimony.

476
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,600
Not bad. They're way ahead out there.
You know what I mean? California.

477
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,200
I tell them to get out of the fucking cab.

478
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,600
One time I saw a cop chasing this guy
with one leg. He was on crutches.

479
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,200
The cop?

480
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,900
No, the dude that he was chasing.
Fucking cops, they chase anything.

481
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,900
Hey, Travis. You got that five you owe me?

482
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,100
The man is loaded.

483
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,400
I'd be broke tonight if I hadn't caught me
some people from Ohio at Kennedy.

484
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,600
I took them into Manhattan by way
of Long Beach. Tipped me $5.

485
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,300
Where's the action around?

486
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,500
It's pretty slow.

487
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,800
I'm shoving on.

488
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,200
Wait.

489
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,100
Can I talk to you for a second?
Bye, killer.

490
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,200
Ninety-nine.

491
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,400
You can have all you want.
Don't be hitting on me!

492
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,300
You better take your ass out, boy!

493
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,300
- Yeah?
- I know you and I ain't talked too much.

494
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,700
But I figured you've been around a lot.
So you could...

495
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,800
Shoot, that's why they call me the "Wizard."

496
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
It's just that I got a...

497
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,900
- I got a...
- Things got you down?

498
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,000
- Yeah.
- It happens to the best of us.

499
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,300
Yeah, it got me real down.

500
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,200
I just want to go out
and really do something.

501
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,200
Taxi life, you mean?

502
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,300
Yeah, well...

503
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,500
No, it's...

504
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,600
I don't know.

505
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,600
I just wanna go out...

506
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,000
and really...

507
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,200
I really wanna...

508
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,200
I got some bad ideas in my head. I just...

509
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,400
Look at it this way.

510
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,800
A man takes a job, you know.

511
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,700
And that job...

512
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,900
I mean, like that...

513
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That becomes what he is.

514
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,800
Like...

515
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,800
you do a thing and that's what you are.
Like, I've been a cabbie for 17 years.

516
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Ten years at night.
I still don't own my own cab.
You know why?

517
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,900
Because I don't want to.
That must be what I want.

518
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,400
To be on the night shift
driving somebody else's cab.

519
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,900
You understand?

520
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,500
I mean, you get a job, you become the job.

521
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,900
One guy lives in Brooklyn.
One guy lives in Sutton Place.

522
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,700
You got a lawyer. Another guy's a doctor.

523
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,500
Another guy dies. Another guy gets well.

524
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,700
People are born.

525
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,800
I envy you, your youth.

526
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,000
Go on, get laid.

527
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,900
Get drunk. Do anything.

528
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,300
Because you got no choice, anyway.
I mean, we're all fucked.

529
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,600
More or less.

530
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,000
I don't know. That's about
the dumbest thing I ever heard.

531
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,600
It's not Bertrand Russell.
What do you want? I'm a cabbie.
What do I know?

532
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,400
I don't even know
what the fuck you're talking about.
Maybe I don't know either.

533
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,200
Don't worry so much.

534
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,700
Relax, killer. You're gonna be all right.
I know. I've seen a lot of people, and...

535
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,600
- I know.
- Okay.

536
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,300
Thanks, man.

537
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,200
I guess...

538
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah, you're all right.

539
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,300
<i>What do you think of your opponent's</i>
<i>chances in the up and coming primary?</i>

540
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,600
<i>Mr. Goodwin is a fine man.</i>

541
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,900
<i>I would certainly,</i>
<i>if it came to it, prefer him...</i>

542
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,800
<i>to our opponent in the other party.</i>

543
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,500
<i>I think that my programs</i>
<i>are better defined than his.</i>

544
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,500
<i>They're more imaginative,</i>
<i>and I have a better chance of winning.</i>

545
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,000
<i>I think it's academic, though, because</i>
<i>he's not gonna win the primary. I am.</i>

546
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,300
<i>One more thing I'd like to ask,</i>
<i>and that's about your campaign.</i>

547
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,600
<i>How do you feel your campaign's going?</i>

548
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,000
<i>When we came up with our slogan,</i>
<i>"We are the people"...</i>

549
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,100
<i>when I said, "Let the people rule"...</i>

550
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,600
<i>I felt I was being</i>
<i>somewhat overly optimistic.</i>

551
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,500
<i>I must tell you that I'm more optimistic</i>
<i>now than ever before.</i>

552
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,200
<i>The people are rising to the demands</i>
<i>that I have made on them.</i>

553
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,200
<i>The people are beginning to rule.</i>
<i>I feel it as the crowds swell.</i>

554
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,400
<i>I know it will continue through the primary,</i>
<i>it will continue in Miami...</i>

555
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:47,400
<i>and I know it will rise</i>
<i>to an unprecedented swell in November.</i>

556
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,400
Bitch, goddamn! I'll blow her face off!
I'll kill her, god damn it!

557
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,700
Damn! If I get my hands on her,
I'll kill her! Goddamn motherfucker!

558
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,400
I swear I'll kill that fucking bitch!

559
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,400
If I get my hands on her, I'll kill her!
Hey, Sport.

560
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,000
I'll kill her! Damn it!

561
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,300
- This guy keeps following.
- Don't look at him.

562
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,800
Hey, guys.

563
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,200
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

564
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,700
<i>Loneliness has followed me</i>
<i>my whole life, everywhere.</i>

565
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
<i>In bars, in cars.</i>

566
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,900
<i>Sidewalks, stores, everywhere.</i>

567
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,900
<i>There's no escape.</i>

568
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,100
<i>I'm God's lonely man.</i>

569
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,800
<i>June 8.</i>

570
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,700
<i>My life has taken another turn again.</i>

571
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,200
<i>The days move along with regularity,</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

572
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,600
<i>One day indistinguishable from the next.</i>
<i>A long continuous chain.</i>

573
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,200
<i>Then suddenly...</i>

574
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,200
<i>there is change.</i>

575
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,700
Hey, Travis, this here's Easy Andy.
He's a traveling salesman.
How you doing, Travis?

576
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,700
- You got a.44 magnum?
- It's an expensive weapon.
That's all right. I got money.

577
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,800
It's a real monster.

578
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,300
It will stop a car at 100 yards.
Put a round right through the engine block.

579
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,200
Here you go.

580
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,300
It's a premium, high-resale weapon.

581
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,100
Look at that.

582
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,100
That's a beauty.

583
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,100
I could sell this gun
to some jungle bunny in Harlem for $500.

584
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,900
But I deal high quality goods
to the right people.

585
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,600
How about that?

586
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,000
This might be a little too big
for practical purposes.

587
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,800
In which case for you, I'd recommend...

588
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,900
.38 snub-nose.

589
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,900
Look at this.

590
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,700
Look at that. That's a beautiful little gun.
It's nickel-plated, snub-nose.

591
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,900
Otherwise the same as a service revolver.
That'll stop anything that moves.

592
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,900
A magnum, they use that in Africa
for killing elephants.

593
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,200
That.38, that's a fine gun.

594
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,600
Some of these guns are like toys.

595
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,900
That.38...

596
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,100
you go and hammer nails with it all day...

597
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,700
come back and it'll cut dead center
on target every time.

598
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,400
It's got a really nice action to it
and a heck of a wallop.

599
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,400
You interested in an automatic?

600
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,900
It's a colt.25 automatic. It's a nice little gun.

601
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,600
It's a beautiful little gun. Holds six shots
in the clip, one shot in the chamber.

602
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,600
That's if you're dumb enough
to put a round in the chamber.

603
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,800
Here, look at this. A.380 Walther.

604
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,900
Holds eight shots in the clip.

605
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,700
That's a nice gun.

606
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,100
That's a beautiful little gun. Look at that.

607
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,900
During World War II,
they used this gun to replace the P-38.

608
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,300
Just given out to officers.

609
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,300
Isn't that a little honey?

610
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,100
- How much for everything?
- All together.

611
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,800
Only a jackass would carry that cannon
in the streets like that. Here.

612
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,900
Here's a beautiful handmade holster
I had made in Mexico.

613
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,200
$40.

614
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,700
$350 for the magnum, $250 for the.38...

615
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,600
$125 for the.25, $150 for the.380.

616
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,300
You take this and wait here.
I'll walk down with you.

617
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,800
How about dope? Grass, hash, coke...

618
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,500
mescaline, downers, Nembutal,
toluol, chloral hydrates?

619
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,700
- How about uppers, amphetamines?
- I'm not interested in that stuff.

620
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,700
I can get you crystal meth, nitrous oxide.

621
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,900
I can get you a brand-new Cadillac
with a pink slip for $2,000.

622
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,300
<i>June 29.</i>

623
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,400
<i>I got to get in shape now.</i>
<i>Too much sitting has ruined my body.</i>

624
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,900
<i>Too much abuse has gone on for too long.</i>

625
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,700
<i>From now on it'll be 50 pushups</i>
<i>each morning, 50 pull-ups.</i>

626
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:18,200
<i>There will be no more pills, no more</i>
<i>bad food, no more destroyers of my body.</i>

627
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,900
<i>From now on it'll be total organization.</i>
<i>Every muscle must be tight.</i>

628
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,900
<i>Look at the size of that. Oh, yeah.</i>

629
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,100
<i>It looks so good.</i>

630
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,500
<i>It's getting harder and harder.</i>
<i>It's throbbing now.</i>

631
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,500
<i>The idea had been growing in my brain</i>
<i>for some time.</i>

632
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:08,900
<i>True force. All the king's men</i>
<i>cannot put it back together again.</i>

633
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,500
Where do get more of these?
Where do you think?
Back at the headquarters.

634
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,300
Go all the way back there to get to town.
- Come on.
- All right. It'll work.

635
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,200
- Maybe it's the speakers.
- It's not. I've done this 100 times.

636
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,500
- You've done this before?
- Yes. Don't worry.

637
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,700
- When was the last time?
- I've never done this before.
Betsy?

638
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
What?

639
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,600
Betsy. Come here.

640
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,500
You're a Secret Service man, aren't you?

641
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,600
Just waiting for the Senator.

642
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,600
You're waiting for the Senator?

643
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,400
That's a very good answer.

644
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,200
Shit, man.

645
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,100
I'm waiting for the sun to shine.
Yeah.

646
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,900
No. The reason I asked
if you were a Secret Service man...

647
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,500
I won't say anything, because I...

648
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,800
I saw some suspicious looking people
over there.

649
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,700
- You did?
- They were right over there.

650
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
They were just here. I...

651
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,200
They were very, very...

652
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,300
- Suspicious?
- Yeah.

653
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,900
Where'd they go?

654
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,200
Is it hard to get to be in the Secret Service?
Why?

655
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,700
I was just curious,
'cause I think I'd be good at it.
I'm very observant.

656
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,700
I was in the Marine Corps.

657
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,500
I'm good with crowds.

658
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,100
I notice there's a little pin there.
That's like a signal, isn't it?

659
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,900
- Sort of.
- Signal.

660
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,700
A secret signal for the Secret Service.

661
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:08,100
What kind of guns you guys carry?
.38s?.45s?.357 magnums?

662
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,000
Something bigger maybe?

663
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:14,600
Look, if you're really interested,
if you give me your name and address...

664
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,900
we'll send you all the information
on how to apply. How's that?

665
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,400
- You will?
- Sure.
Okay.

666
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,500
Why not?

667
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,000
My name is Henry...

668
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,700
Krinkle. K-R-I-N-K-L-E.

669
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,400
154 Hopper Avenue.

670
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,700
- Hopper.
- Yeah.

671
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
Like a rabbit. Hip, hop.

672
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,900
Fairlawn, New Jersey.

673
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,500
- Is there a zip code with that, Henry?
- Yeah. 610452.

674
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,800
- Okay.
- That's six digits.

675
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,100
61045.

676
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,900
Okay.

677
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,600
I was thinking of my telephone number.

678
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,200
I've got it all, Henry,
we'll get all the stuff right out to you.

679
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,600
Thanks a lot. Great. Hell. Jesus.

680
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,200
- Be careful today.
- Right. Will do.

681
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:32,200
You have to be careful
living around a place like this.
Bye.

682
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,400
Damn it.

683
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,600
Faster than you, you fucking son of a...

684
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,100
I saw you coming, you fucking shit-heel.

685
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,100
I'm standing here. You make the move.

686
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,000
It's your move.

687
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,300
Don't try it, you fuck.

688
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,700
You talking to me?

689
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,800
Then who the hell else are you talking to?
You talking to me?

690
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,900
I'm the only one here.

691
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,800
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

692
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,700
Oh, yeah?

693
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,300
Okay.

694
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,500
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i>

695
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:23,300
<i>Here is a man</i>
<i>who would not take it anymore.</i>
<i>Who would not let...</i>

696
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:27,000
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screw-heads.</i>

697
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:30,600
<i>Here is a man</i>
<i>who would not take it anymore.</i>

698
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:35,500
<i>A man who stood up against the scum,</i>
<i>the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.</i>

699
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,100
<i>Here is someone who stood up.</i>

700
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,100
<i>Here is...</i>

701
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,200
You're dead.

702
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,900
Yeah, man?

703
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:33,700
Shut your mouth. Give me the cash
out of the drawer. Come on.

704
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,900
Let's go. Give me the goddamn cash.

705
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,300
- Don't shoot. I'm getting it.
- Stop taking so long. Come on.

706
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,200
Let me have it. Give me the bread.

707
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,300
- This all you got? Get the rest.
- That's it.

708
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,900
- I don't have any more.
- Give me the rest of the cash.

709
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,600
- That's all I got.
- Give me more.

710
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,400
- I got no money.
- Reach in your sock. You got more bread.

711
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,200
- That's it, man.
- Give me the rest of the fucking bread.

712
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,100
- Did you get him?
- Yeah, I got him.

713
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,200
Shit, man.

714
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:14,200
- Is he dead?
- I don't know. His eyes are moving.

715
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:24,300
Listen, I ain't got a permit for this thing.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

716
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,700
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

717
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,300
- Can I give you some money?
- No. Just get out of here.

718
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,100
No, man. I'll take care of it. Go ahead.

719
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,400
That's the fifth motherfucker this year.
You wanna buy that little dope?

720
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,600
<i>Walt Whitman, that great American poet...</i>

01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,100
<i>"and I know you would be proud</i>
<i>if you could see her.</i>

741
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,800
<i>"Here name is Betsy,</i>
<i>but I can tell you no more than that."</i>

742
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,700
Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.

743
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,800
Come on, let's go. Move it.

744
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:01,600
<i>No more will we, the people...</i>
<i>bear the burden of suffering for the few.</i>

745
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:06,000
<i>No more will we fight the wars of the few...</i>

746
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,400
<i>to the harm of the many.</i>

747
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,900
<i>"I hope this card finds you all well</i>
<i>as it does me.</i>

748
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,300
<i>"I hope no one has died.</i>
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

749
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:23,400
<i>"One day there'll be a knock on the door,</i>
<i>and it'll be me.</i>

750
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,800
<i>"Love, Travis."</i>

751
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,700
<i>- Don't you have some idea?</i>
<i>- I'm not the one who wants to talk.</i>

752
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,600
<i>- Don't you have some idea?</i>
<i>- I'm not the one who wants to talk.</i>

753
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:40,300
<i>But you must know that the reason</i>
<i>I didn't marry him...</i>

754
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:45,000
<i>is because I couldn't stand</i>
<i>to be a cause of divorce.</i>

755
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:51,800
<i>Now, he's getting a divorce anyway, and...</i>

756
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,400
<i>Phillip wants to marry me, Brock.</i>

757
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,100
<i>I do love him.</i>

758
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,600
<i>What about us, June?</i>

759
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,600
<i>Our marriage?</i>

760
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,600
<i>You've got to know</i>
<i>that our marriage wasn't legal.</i>

761
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,500
<i>In the eyes of God, we are married.</i>

762
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:26,100
<i>Brock, please don't do this to me.</i>

763
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,500
<i>I love him...</i>

764
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,900
Damn!

765
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,100
Goddamn!

766
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,000
Are you trying to get rid of me?

767
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:27,400
- You looking for some action?
- Yeah.

768
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,300
- You see that guy over there?
- Yeah.

769
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,400
All right. You go talk to him.
His name is Matthew.

770
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,500
- I'll be over there waiting for you.
- Okay.

771
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,900
Is your name Matthew? I want some action.

772
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,900
Officer...

773
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,800
I swear I'm clean.
I'm just waiting here for a friend.

774
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,600
You gonna bust me for nothing, man?

775
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,300
I'm not a cop.

776
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,200
- I ain't no cop.
- Then why ask me for action?

777
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,100
Because she sent me over.

778
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:13,500
I suppose that ain't a.38
you got in your sock.
.38? No.

779
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,300
I'm clean, man.

780
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,200
- Shit. You're a real cowboy?
- Yeah.

781
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,000
That's nice.

782
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,700
It's all right.
$15, 15 minutes. $25, half an hour.

783
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,600
Shit.

784
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,900
Cowboy, huh?

785
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,500
I once had a horse in Coney Island.
She got hit by a car.

786
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,100
Take it or leave it.

787
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,600
If you wanna save yourself some money,
don't fuck her.

788
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,600
'Cause you'll be back every night
for more.

789
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:53,100
She's twelve-and-a-half years old.
You ain't never had no pussy like that.

790
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,800
You can do anything with her...

791
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,600
come on her, fuck her in the mouth,
fuck her in the ass, come on her face.

792
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:02,100
She'll get your cock so hard,
she'll make it explode.

793
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,600
But no rough stuff. All right?

794
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,200
All right, I'll take it.

795
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,100
Hey, man! Take out no money over here.

796
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:22,500
You gonna fuck me?
You're gonna fuck her.
You give her the money.

797
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Catch you later, copper.

798
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,900
- What did you say?
- See you later, copper.

799
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,100
I'm no cop, man.

800
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,900
If you are, it's entrapment already.

801
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,000
I'm hip.

802
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,000
Buddy, you don't look hip.

803
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,400
Go ahead, have yourself a good time.

804
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,100
You're a funny guy.

805
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,500
But looks aren't everything.

806
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,900
Go ahead, have a good time.

807
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,800
You're a funny guy.

808
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,200
The room will cost you $10.

809
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,000
I'm timing you, too.

810
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,300
Come on.

811
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,600
Are you really twelve-and-a-half?

812
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,900
Listen, mister, it's your time.
Fifteen minutes ain't long.

813
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,600
When that cigarette burns out,
your time is up.

814
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,300
How old are you?

815
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,300
You don't want to tell me?

816
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,100
- What's your name?
- Easy.

817
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:17,900
- That's not any kind of name.
- It's easy to remember.
But what's your real name?

818
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,000
I don't like my real name.
What's your real name?

819
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,200
Iris.

820
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:32,500
What's wrong with that? That's a nice name.
That's what you think.

821
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,900
No, don't do that. Don't you remember me?

822
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,200
Remember when you got into a taxi?
It was a checker taxi.

823
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:51,900
You got in and that guy Matthew came by
and he said he wanted to take you away.

824
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,900
He pulled you away.

825
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,400
No, I don't remember that.

826
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,900
- You don't remember any of that?
- No.

827
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,400
That's all right.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

828
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,900
We better make it or Sport will get mad.
How do you wanna make it?

829
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:12,400
I don't want to make it. Who's Sport?
That's Matthew. I call him Sport.

830
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,800
Want to make it like this?

831
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,100
Listen, I...
Can't you understand something?

832
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,800
You're the one who came into my cab.
You wanted to get out of here.

833
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,800
I must have been stoned.

834
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,300
What do you mean? They drug you?
Come off it, man.

835
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,600
What are you doing?

836
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,900
Don't you wanna make it?

837
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,200
No, I don't wanna make it. I wanna help you.

838
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,100
Well, I can help you.

839
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,900
Damn, man! Goddamn it!

840
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,400
Shit, man!
What the hell's the matter with you?

841
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,100
You don't have to make it, mister.
Goddamn it!
Don't you wanna get out of here?

842
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,600
Can't you understand why I came here?

843
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,300
I think I understand.

844
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:26,500
I tried to get into your cab one night,
and now you wanna take me away.

845
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,200
Is that it?

846
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,500
Yeah, but don't you want to go?

847
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:35,700
I can leave anytime I want to.
Then what about that one night?

848
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,400
Look, I was stoned.

849
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,200
That's why they stopped me.

850
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,200
When I'm not stoned,
I got no place else to go.

851
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:54,700
So they just protect me from myself.

852
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,200
No. I don't know.

853
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,600
I don't know. Okay, I tried.

854
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,700
Look, I understand.

855
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,500
And it means something, really.

856
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:22,200
Look, can I see you again?
- That's not hard to do.
- I don't mean like that.

857
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:26,300
I mean, you know, regularly.
This is nothing for a person to do.

858
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:31,700
All right. How about breakfast tomorrow?
- Tomorrow, when?
- I get up at about 1:00.

859
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,100
Well, I got a thing...

860
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:42,800
Come on, do you want to or not?
Yeah, I want... Okay, all right. 1:00.

861
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,400
See you tomorrow.

862
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,600
Iris, my name is Travis.

863
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,400
Thanks a lot, Travis.

864
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:58,200
So long, Iris. See you tomorrow.

865
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,500
Sweet Iris.

866
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,600
This is yours.

867
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,700
Spend it right.

868
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,600
- Come back anytime, cowboy.
- I will.

869
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,600
Why do you want me
to go back to my parents?

870
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,700
I mean, they hate me.
Why do you think I split in the first place?

871
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,400
There ain't nothing there.
Yeah, but you can't live like this. It's a hell.

872
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,900
A girl should live at home.

873
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,500
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
What do you mean, women's lib?

874
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,600
You're a young girl.
You should be home now.

875
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:23,700
You should be dressed up,
going out with boys, going to school.

876
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:27,300
- You know, that kind of stuff.
- God, are you square.

877
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:31,800
Hey, I'm not square.
You're the one that's square.
You're full of shit, man.

878
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,200
What are you talking about?
You walk out with those fucking creeps...

879
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:40,500
lowlifes and degenerates out on the street
and you sell your little pussy for nothing...

880
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,200
for some lowlife pimp
who stands in a hole?

881
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,300
I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

882
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,400
I don't screw and fuck with a bunch
of killers and junkies the way you do.

883
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,700
You call that being hip?

884
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,300
What world you from?

885
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:06,900
- Who's a killer?
- Sport's a killer, that's who's a killer.

886
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,100
- Sport never killed nobody.
- He killed somebody.

887
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,200
- He's a Libra.
- He's a what?

888
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,600
I'm a Libra, too.
That's why we get along so well.

889
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,300
He looks like a killer to me.

890
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,200
I think that Cancers make the best lovers...

891
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:28,000
but, God, my whole family are earth signs.
He's also a dope shooter.

892
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:32,100
What makes you so high and mighty?
Will you tell me that?

893
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:36,000
Didn't you ever try looking
at your own eyeballs in the mirror?

894
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,700
So what are you gonna do
about Sport and that old bastard?

895
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,700
- When?
- When you leave.

896
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,900
- I don't know. Just leave them.
- You're just gonna leave?

897
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,800
- They've got plenty of other girls.
- You just can't do that. What will you do?

898
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,900
- What do you want me to do, call the cops?
- Cops don't do nothing. You know that.

899
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:07,300
Sport never treated me bad.
He didn't beat me up
or anything like that once.

900
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,800
But you can't allow him
to do the same to other girls.

901
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:15,300
You can't allow him to do that.
He's the lowest kind of person in the world.

902
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,000
Somebody's got to do something to him.
He's the scum of the earth.

903
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:22,800
He's the worst sucking scum...

904
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,700
I have ever seen.

905
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,500
You know what he told me about you?

906
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,800
He's calling you names.
He called you a little piece of chicken.

907
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,400
He doesn't mean that.

908
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,300
I'll move up to one
of them communes in Vermont.

909
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:54,600
I never seen a commune before,
but I don't know, you know?
I saw...

910
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:59,400
some pictures once in a magazine.
It didn't look very clean.

911
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:04,700
Why don't you come
to the commune with me?
What, come to the commune with you? No.

912
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,700
Why not?

913
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,000
I don't go to places like that.

914
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:15,300
- Come on, why not?
- I don't get along with people like that.

915
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,500
- Are you a Scorpion?
- What?

916
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,900
That's it, you're a Scorpion.
I can tell every time.

917
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:23,900
Besides, I got to stay here.

918
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:29,100
- Come on, why?
- I got something very important to do.
What's so important?

919
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:33,100
Doing something for the government.

920
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,100
The cab thing is just part-time.

921
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,600
Are you a narc?

922
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,000
- Do I look like a narc?
- Yeah.

923
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,000
I am a narc.

924
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,500
God! I don't know who's weirder, you or me.

925
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,500
Sure you don't wanna come with me?

926
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,800
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you the money to go.

927
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:05,600
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, I want you to take it.

928
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,700
I don't want you to take anything from them.

929
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,400
And I wanna do it.

930
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:13,900
I don't have anything better to do
with my money.

931
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,600
I might be going away for a while.

932
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,900
You're just a little tense, that's all.

933
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:49,200
I don't like what I'm doing, Sport.

934
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,600
Baby, I never wanted you
to like what you're doing.

935
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,600
If you ever liked what you were doing,
you wouldn't be my woman.

936
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:03,600
You never spend any time with me anymore.
I've got to attend to business, baby.

937
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,300
You miss your man, don't you?

938
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,800
I don't like to be away from you, either.

939
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,900
You know how I feel about you.

940
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,800
I depend on you.

941
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,500
I'd be lost without you.

942
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,500
Don't you ever forget that.

943
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,900
How much I need you.

944
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,200
Come to me, baby.

945
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,100
Let me hold you.

946
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,600
When you're close to me like this,
I feel so good.

947
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,800
I only wish every man could know
what it's like to be loved by you.

948
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,600
That every woman everywhere...

949
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:25,700
had a man that loves her like I love you.

950
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,700
God, it's good so close.

951
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:49,800
You know, at times like this,
I know I'm a lucky man.

952
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:56,200
Touching a woman
who wants me and needs me.

953
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,300
Yeah, it's only you that keeps me together.

954
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:42,100
<i>Now I see it clearly.</i>
<i>My whole life is pointed in one direction.</i>

955
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,400
<i>I see that now.</i>

956
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,200
<i>There never has been any choice for me.</i>

957
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,800
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the next president of the United States...</i>

958
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,300
<i>Senator Charles Palantine.</i>

959
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,900
<i>Thank you, Tom.</i>

960
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,400
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

961
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,700
<i>we are met today at a crossroads:</i>
<i>Columbus Circle.</i>

962
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,800
<i>This is no ordinary place.</i>

963
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,600
<i>It is a place where many roads...</i>

964
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,200
<i>and many lives intersect.</i>

965
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:55,600
<i>It is appropriate that we meet here today...</i>

966
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:58,700
<i>because these are not ordinary times.</i>

967
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:02,700
<i>We meet at a crossroads in history.</i>

968
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:07,700
<i>For far too long,</i>
<i>the wrong roads have been taken.</i>

969
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,800
<i>The wrong roads have led us into war...</i>

970
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,900
<i>into poverty, into unemployment</i>
<i>and inflation.</i>

971
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,200
<i>Today I say to you,</i>
<i>we have reached the turning point.</i>

972
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:27,600
<i>No longer will we, the people,</i>
<i>suffer for the few.</i>

973
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:40,700
<i>Now, I would lie to you if I told you</i>
<i>the new roads would be easy.</i>

974
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,100
<i>They will not be easy.</i>

975
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,900
<i>Nothing that is right and good</i>
<i>has ever been easy.</i>

976
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,400
<i>We, the people, know that.</i>

977
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:57,200
<i>And we, the people,</i>
<i>know the right roads and the good.</i>

978
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:02,500
<i>Today I say to you,</i>
<i>we are the people, you and I...</i>

979
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,800
<i>and it is time to let the people rule.</i>

980
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:07,500
<i>Thank you.</i>

981
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,900
All right, let him go, pull back.

982
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,100
Palantine!

983
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:42,000
Thank you.

984
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,200
Over there. Get that man.

985
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,600
Give him some air!

986
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,200
Give him some air, will you?

987
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,000
- I never saw him.
- I saw him run.

988
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,700
Where was he?

989
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:29,000
- What's happening?
- How you doing?
Got the money?

990
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,200
- Iris in her room?
- Yeah.

991
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,700
Hey, Sport, how you doing?

992
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,900
Okay, my man. How are you?

993
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,300
- Where do I know you from?
- I don't know.

994
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,300
How's everything in the pimp business?

995
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:34,200
- Do I know you?
- No. Do I know you?

996
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:38,700
- Get out of here. Come on, get lost.
- Do I know you?

997
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,300
How's Iris?

998
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,100
You know, Iris.

999
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,600
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1000
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,800
Iris. Come on, get out of here, man.

1001
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:54,400
You don't know anybody
by the name of Iris?
I don't know nobody named Iris.

1002
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,100
No?

1003
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,800
Get back to your fucking tribe
before you get hurt.

1004
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,800
Do me a favor.
I don't want no trouble, okay?

1005
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,800
You got a gun?

1006
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:09,400
Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get out of here.

1007
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:11,100
Suck on this.

1008
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:27,600
You crazy son of a bitch!

1009
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:31,400
Fucking son of a bitch, you! I'll kill you!

1010
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,700
I'll fucking kill you!

1011
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:40,300
Crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1012
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,700
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

1013
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,800
You crazy son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1014
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,900
Stop!

1015
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:28,600
No! Don't shoot him!

1016

01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:46,800
"Why don't you throw in something else,
like your wife?"
His wife was Miss New Jersey 1957.

1039
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:51,100
That's why the fleet has no spares.
Doughboy, wizard, killer.

1040
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,000
- Charlie T.
- What's happening?

1041
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,500
Travis, you got a fare.

1042
01:47:58,100 --> 01:47:59,100
Shit.

1043
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,100
- See you later.
- See you, Travis.

1044
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,000
Hello, Travis.

1045
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:28,900
Hello.

1046
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,400
I hear Palantine got the nomination.

1047
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,900
Yeah. Won't be long now. Seventeen days.

1048
01:48:58,200 --> 01:48:59,700
I hope he wins.

1049
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:17,000
I read about you in the papers.
How are you?

1050
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,300
It was nothing, really. I got over that.

1051
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,300
Papers always blow these things up.

1052
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:31,900
Just a little stiffness, that's all.

1053
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:17,900
How much was it?

1054
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:28,300
So long.
