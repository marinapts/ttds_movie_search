...lived in such a way
as to defy slander.

00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:41,562
...in my profession
we hear many such stories.

319
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:45,645
Yours is the most intriguing and touching
I've heard in weeks.

320
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:48,909
Nevertheless,
I cannot grant your request.

321
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,612
But, I'll tell you what I will do.

322
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:54,659
FEENEY: I'll allow you to keep
those fine boots...

...which normally I would have
for myself.

The next town is only five miles away.

325
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:03,538
And I suggest you now start walking.

326
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,756
Mightn't I keep my horse?

327
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:07,837
I would like to oblige you...

328
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:12,432
...but, people like us must be able
to travel faster than our clients.

...who had killed a man in a duel and
was anxious to find refuge from the Law...

...the chance to earn distinction
in the European wars...

into a proper young soldier.

The Regiment's strength
was steadily increased...

387

...by the arrival of other troops...

I couldn't tell her.

She wouldn't care about those things.

...that she had to console herself
with a husband.

He recovered from his wound.

414
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,756
The shot you hit him with could not
hurt him. It was made of tow.

1,500 a year out of the family.

The plan of the duel was arranged
in order to get you out of the way.

The cowardly Quin couldn't
be brought to marry...

419

you certainly did, me lad.

With a fine thick plugget of tow.

He was so frightened,
it took him an hour to come to.

Are you in want of cash?

was now on it's way.

a rearguard of Frenchmen...

wished to pass.

...but remember the ploughmen,

...I'm a British Officer.

642
01:04:01,655 --> 01:04:04,229
You're a liar and an imposter.

643
01:04:05,534 --> 01:04:06,993
You're a deserter.

644
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:12,540
POTZDORF: I suspected you this morning.
Your lies and folly have confirmed this.

645
01:04:13,542 --> 01:04:17,670
You pretend to carry despatches
to a General, dead these ten months.

You say the British Ambassador in Berlin...

647
01:04:20,674 --> 01:04:23,960
...is your uncle,
with the ridiculous name of O'Grady.

648
01:04:26,013 --> 01:04:29,464
Now, will you join and take the bounty,
or be given up?

I volunteer.

[Military march music, background]

651
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,144
NARRATOR: The Prussian Service
was worse than the English.

652
01:04:44,365 --> 01:04:47,816
The life of a Private Soldier
was frightful.

653
01:04:50,204 --> 01:04:54,332
Punishment was incessant.
Every Officer had the right to inflict it.

654
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,744
The gauntlet was a common penalty
for minor offences.

655
01:05:01,924 --> 01:05:06,301
More serious ones were punishable
by mutilation or death.

the army...

657
01:05:19,191 --> 01:05:23,652
...renowned for its disciplined valour,
was officered by native Prussians.

658
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,403
But it was mostly composed...

659
01:05:28,117 --> 01:05:30,868
...of men from the lowest levels
of humanity...

660
01:05:31,453 --> 01:05:33,695
...hired or stolen
from every nation in Europe.

661
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:40,878
Thus, Barry fell
into the worst company...

662
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:46,967

the science of every kind of misconduct.

...with the conduct of the Regiment
at the Battle of Audorf...

in rescuing Captain Potzdorf...

You're a gallant soldier,
and evidently of good stock...

685
01:09:57,344 --> 01:09:59,799
...but you're idle and unprincipled.

I hope the Colonel is mistaken.

I have fallen into bad company,
but I've only done as other soldiers do.

690

I've never had a friend
or protector before...

691

...to show that I was worthy
of better things.

01:10:25,872 --> 01:10:29,206
The Colonel may say I'm ruined,
and send me to the Devil.

01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:35,356
...I've spoken to the Minister regarding
your services and your fortune is made.

and, in time...

...we'll allow you to move
in a better sphere.

Thank you, Captain.

710
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:57,454
Your Ioyalty to me and service
to the Regiment has pleased me.

711
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:03,466
Now there is another occasion
on which you can assist us.

...your reward will be secure.

I'll do my best, sir.

715
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:27,907
There is a gentleman in Berlin
in the service of the Empress of Austria.

716
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,906
He calls himself
the Chevalier de Balibari.

717
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:35,747
He appears to be a professional gambler.

718
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:39,293
POTZDORF: He's a libertine:

719
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:41,664
Fond of women, of good food...

720
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:44,170
...polished, obliging.

721
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:49,219
He speaks French and German indifferently.

722
01:12:50,392 --> 01:12:54,010

that Monsieur de Balibari...

...is a native of your country of Ireland.

724
01:12:59,776 --> 01:13:02,611
And that he has come here as a spy.

725
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:15,949
Your knowledge of English...

726
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:19,744
...makes you an ideal choice
to go into his service...

727
01:13:20,755 --> 01:13:23,377
...and find out whether or not
he is a spy.

that can be of service to you...

say you are Hungarian.

...but when Barry saw
the Chevalier's splendour...

...of the burst of feeling
now about to take place.

My name is Redmond Barry.

...at thus finding one
of his countrymen.

After Mass he comes home for breakfast.

He then takes an airing in his carriage.

NARRATOR: Barry presented his reports
regularly to the Minister.

The details were arranged
beforehand with the Chevalier.

He was instructed to tell the truth...

...as much as his story
would possibly bear.

781

was very minute and accurate...

That, before strangers,
he should not know a word of English.

And that he should keep a lookout
on the trumps when serving the wine.

01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:21,780
...and a natural aptitude...

792
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:26,366
...he was able to give his dear patron
much assistance...

793
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:29,449
...against his opponents
at the green table.

794
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:34,203
Lf, for instance, he wiped
the table with a napkin...

795
01:19:34,712 --> 01:19:37,285
...the enemy was strong in Diamonds.

796
01:19:39,133 --> 01:19:41,624
If he adjusted a chair it meant Ace King.

797
01:19:41,719 --> 01:19:45,170
If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?"...

798
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:47,512
...Hearts were meant, and so forth.

[Soft classical melody continues,

01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,355
NARRATOR: The Prince of Tbingen...

801
01:20:01,447 --> 01:20:05,112
...who had intimate connections
with the Great Frederick...

802
01:20:06,786 --> 01:20:10,237
...was passionately fond of play
as were the gentlemen...

803
01:20:10,456 --> 01:20:12,912
...of almost all the Courts of Europe.

804
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:16,043
[In German] You owe
15,500 frederick d'or.

805

[Soft classical melody continues,
background]

806
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:52,028
Chevalier...

807
01:20:56,043 --> 01:20:57,952
...though I cannot say how...

808
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,788
...I believe you have cheated me.

809
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:12,008
I deny Your Grace's accusation...

810
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:15,597
...and beg you to say
how you have been cheated.

811
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:19,311
I don't know.

812
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:22,061
But I believe I have been.

813
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,188
Your Grace owes me
15,500 frederick d'or...

814
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:31,444
...which I have honourably won.

815
01:21:33,706 --> 01:21:34,820
Chevalier...

816
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,994
...if you will have your money now
you must fight for it.

817
01:21:43,174 --> 01:21:44,882
If you will be patient...

818
01:21:46,093 --> 01:21:48,798
...maybe I will pay you something
another time.

819
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:57,435
Your Grace, if I am to be so tame
as to take this...

820
01:21:58,189 --> 01:22:01,558
...then I must give up an honourable
and lucrative occupation.

821
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:05,769
I have said all there is to be said.

822
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:10,483
I am at your disposal
for whatever purposes you wish.

823
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:13,991
Good night.

824
01:22:36,268 --> 01:22:38,012
Was the Prince cheated?

825
01:22:40,523 --> 01:22:44,271
BARRY: In as far as I am able
to tell, Herr Minister, no.

826
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,852
I believe he won the money fairly.

827
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:53,858
POTZDORF: What are
the Chevalier's intentions?

828
01:22:54,745 --> 01:22:56,156
BARRY: I'm not sure.

829
01:22:56,497 --> 01:23:00,957
The Prince told him that if he wanted
his money he'd have to fight for it.

830
01:23:04,505 --> 01:23:07,422
MINISTER: A meeting
with the Prince is impossible.

831
01:23:11,345 --> 01:23:13,753
The Prince has left him no other choice.

832
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:26,858
[Inaudible whispering]

833
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:45,121
Will you be able to return here tomorrow
without arousing suspicion?

834
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:49,751
I know they won't allow a meeting
with the Prince.

835
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:54,463
But if I say that, do you know any reason
why he'll pay me what he owes?

836
01:23:56,098 --> 01:23:59,218
You must tell them I intend
to demand satisfaction.

837
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:02,475
Don't look so downcast, my boy.

838
01:24:03,063 --> 01:24:07,013
They cannot harm me,
the Austrian Embassy will see to that.

839
01:24:07,693 --> 01:24:11,987
The worst they can do is send me
out of this dreary country of theirs.

840
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:16,277
If they should, don't worry...

841
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:19,195
...you shall not be left behind.

842
01:24:19,872 --> 01:24:21,414
Have no fear of that.

843
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:27,368
The King has determined to send
the Chevalier out of the country.

844
01:24:28,505 --> 01:24:30,794
Has he already demanded satisfaction?

845
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,879
Not yet, but I believe he intends to...

846
01:24:37,056 --> 01:24:38,431
...possibly today.

847
01:24:39,433 --> 01:24:41,639
MINISTER: Then this
must be done tomorrow.

848
01:24:41,935 --> 01:24:44,142
POTZDORF:
All the arrangements are made.

849
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:52,945
You said he takes a drive
after breakfast every day.

850
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:55,277
Yes, sir.

851
01:24:56,533 --> 01:24:59,700
Is there any reason he should do
any different tomorrow?

852
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,075
No, sir.

853
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:03,738
Good.

854
01:25:05,501 --> 01:25:08,620
When the Chevalier comes out
to his carriage in the morning...

855
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:12,213
...two Officers will meet him
and escort him to the frontier.

856
01:25:13,133 --> 01:25:15,541
POTZDORF: His baggage
will be sent after him.

857
01:25:15,636 --> 01:25:16,750
Excellent.

858
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:31,515
NARRATOR: At ten o'clock
the next morning...

859
01:25:31,985 --> 01:25:34,108
...the Chevalier de Balibari...

860
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,484
...went out for his regular morning drive.

861
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,792
Where's my servant, Lazlo?

862
01:25:49,253 --> 01:25:51,708
I will let down the steps, Your Honour.

863
01:26:02,432 --> 01:26:03,843
BARRY: What is this about?

864
01:26:03,934 --> 01:26:05,345
Please get inside.

865
01:26:08,021 --> 01:26:09,516
Am I under arrest?

866
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:12,437
1ST OFFICER: We're driving
to the frontier.

867
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:16,775
Frontier? But I'm on my way
to the Austrian Ambassador's house.

868
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,859
1ST OFFICER: My orders are
to escort you to the frontier...

869
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:22,441
...and see you safely across the border.

870
01:26:23,161 --> 01:26:24,988
But, I'm not going to the frontier.

871
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:29,160
I have very important business
at the Austrian Ambassador's house.

872
01:26:29,501 --> 01:26:31,992
1ST OFFICER: My orders are
to take Your Honour...

873
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:34,543
...to the frontier
by any means necessary.

874
01:26:34,631 --> 01:26:36,007
If you come willingly...

875
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:39,092
...I'm to give you this purse
on behalf of the Prince of Tbingen...

876
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:41,300
...containing 2,000 frederick d'or.

877
01:26:51,398 --> 01:26:53,521
BARRY: All Europe shall hear
of this.

878
01:26:59,698 --> 01:27:03,316
NARRATOR: And so,
without papers or passport...

879
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:07,240
...and under the eyes
of two Prussian Officers...

880
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:12,207
...Barry was escorted across the frontier
into Saxony and freedom.

881
01:27:13,921 --> 01:27:18,499
The Chevalier himself had uneventfully
crossed the frontier the night before.

[Soft classical melody, background]

883

NARRATOR: By these wonderful
circumstances, Barry was free again...

884
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:39,273
...and began his professional work
as a gamester...

885
01:27:40,155 --> 01:27:44,983
...resolving, thenceforward and forever,
to live the life of a gentleman.

[In French] The four wins.

888
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:54,417
NARRATOR: Soon he and the Chevalier
were received in all the Courts of Europe...

889
01:27:55,337 --> 01:27:56,748
...and were speedily...

890
01:27:56,838 --> 01:28:00,290
...in the very best society
where play was patronized...

891
01:28:00,759 --> 01:28:04,009
...and professors of that science
always welcome.

[In French] Five thousand.

[In French] Now, I'm weary.

916

[In French] I would like dinner.
Shall we?

917
01:30:00,086 --> 01:30:01,913
Excuse me, Lord Ludd.

918
01:30:03,381 --> 01:30:04,840
BARRY: If you don't mind.

919
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:07,088
Not at all.

920
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:14,549
NARRATOR: They always played on credit
with anyone of honour or noble lineage.

921
01:30:15,685 --> 01:30:17,761
They never pressed for their winnings...

922
01:30:18,021 --> 01:30:20,939
...or declined to receive
promissory notes.

923
01:30:22,526 --> 01:30:25,811
But woe to the man who did not pay
when the note became due.

924
01:30:26,613 --> 01:30:29,733
Barry was sure to wait upon him
with his bill.

925
01:30:30,408 --> 01:30:32,116
There were few bad debts.

FRENCH REFEREE:
[In French] Saluez.

927
01:30:33,954 --> 01:30:37,738
NARRATOR: It was Barry's skill with
the sword, and readiness to use it...

928
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:41,249
...that maintained the reputation
of the firm, so to speak.

929

FRENCH REFEREE: [In French]
On guard!

I will pay you today, sir.

931
01:31:36,308 --> 01:31:38,680
NARRATOR: Thus,
it will be seen, their life...

932
01:31:38,768 --> 01:31:42,848
...for all its splendour,
was not without danger and difficulty...

933
01:31:44,107 --> 01:31:46,859
...requiring talent and determination
for success.

934
01:31:48,028 --> 01:31:51,479
And required them to live
a wandering and disconnected life.

935
01:31:53,325 --> 01:31:57,536
And, though they were swimming
upon the high tide of fortune...

936
01:31:58,038 --> 01:32:02,249
...and prospering with the cards,
they had little to show for their labour...

937
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,122
...but some fine clothes
and a few trinkets.

938
01:32:07,049 --> 01:32:09,670
[Classical instrumental melody,
background]

939
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:22,935
NARRATOR: Five years in the Army,
and considerable experience of the world...

940
01:32:23,732 --> 01:32:27,943
...had dispelled any romantic notions
regarding love...

941
01:32:28,695 --> 01:32:30,854
...with which Barry commenced life.

942
01:32:31,531 --> 01:32:35,659
And he had it in mind,
as many gentlemen had done before him...

943
01:32:36,286 --> 01:32:39,453
...to marry a woman
of fortune and condition.

944
01:32:40,624 --> 01:32:43,031
And, as such things so often happen...

945
01:32:43,418 --> 01:32:47,712
...these thoughts coincided

WOMAN: Good morning, sir.

1101
01:52:04,745 --> 01:52:08,363
Would you mind excusing us?
I'd like a word alone with Lady Lyndon.

1102
01:52:34,358 --> 01:52:35,437
I'm sorry.

...all cunningly worked
with silver thread.

1106

TAILOR: No finer velvet
has ever been woven...

1107
01:53:28,537 --> 01:53:30,695
...and you will see none
better anywhere.

LADY LYNDON: Pardon me, gentlemen.

1109
01:53:36,044 --> 01:53:37,835
Good morning, dearest.

1110
01:53:39,172 --> 01:53:43,087
We're taking the children for a ride
to the village. We'll be back for tea.

1111
01:53:43,176 --> 01:53:45,465
BARRY: Have a nice time.
I'll see you then.

1112
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:47,512
Goodbye, little Bryan.

1113
01:53:51,977 --> 01:53:53,637
BARRY: Lord Bullingdon.

1114
01:53:55,814 --> 01:53:57,723
Take good care of your mother.

1115
01:54:03,446 --> 01:54:06,068
Come now, give your father a proper kiss.

1116

LADY LYNDON: Lord Bullingdon...

1117
01:54:19,045 --> 01:54:21,833
...is that the way to behave
to your father?

1118
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,251
Lord Bullingdon,
have you lost your tongue?

1119
01:54:30,849 --> 01:54:35,427
My father was Sir Charles Lyndon.
I have not forgotten him, if others have.

1120
01:54:37,522 --> 01:54:40,309
Lord Bullingdon,
you have insulted your father!

1121
01:54:41,985 --> 01:54:44,441
Madam, you have insulted my father.

1122
01:54:49,326 --> 01:54:53,620
Dearest, would you excuse us?
We have something to discuss in private.

1123

BARRY: Lord Bullingdon...

1133
01:55:42,587 --> 01:55:46,086
...I have always been willing
to live with you on friendly terms.

1134
01:55:46,549 --> 01:55:48,459
But be clear about one thing:

1135
01:55:49,803 --> 01:55:51,879
As men serve me, I serve them.

1136
01:55:53,598 --> 01:55:56,220
I never laid a cane on the back
of a Lord before...

1137
01:55:56,309 --> 01:56:00,307
...but, if you force me to, I shall
speedily become used to the practice.

to say for yourself?

No.

NARRATOR: Barry believed, and not
without some reason, that it had been...

01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:22,990
...a declaration of war against him
by Bullingdon from the start...

1143
01:56:23,795 --> 01:56:26,464
...and that the evil consequences
that ensued...

1144

...were entirely of Bullingdon's creating.

I shall show you the knot that never was.

1148

NARRATOR: As Bullingdon grew up
to be a man...

1149
01:56:42,647 --> 01:56:45,731
...his hatred for Barry
assumed an intensity...

1150

...equalled only by his
increased devotion to his mother.

...the local nobility,
gentry and their children...

MAGICIAN: Wave your hand
over my green silk handkerchief...

1168

...and see if we can produce
a magic flower. I wonder if we can?

produce but one colour, Bryan.

as many Artillery men's heads...

by our noble Prince Henry.

"Who is the man who has done this?"
I stepped forward.

1187
01:59:03,788 --> 01:59:06,361
"How many heads was it
that you cut off? " He says.

1188
01:59:06,457 --> 01:59:09,245
"Nineteen," says I,
"besides wounding several."

1189

Well, I'll be blessed,
if he didn't burst into tears.

BARRY: "Noble, noble fellow,"
he said.

1191
01:59:17,343 --> 01:59:21,637
"Here is nineteen golden guineas,
one for each head that you cut off."

What do you think of that?

1193

Were you allowed to keep the heads?

No, they always become
the property of the King.

Will you tell me another story?

1196

I'll tell you one tomorrow.

1197

Will you play cards with me tomorrow?

1198

Of course I will. Now go to sleep.

I don't mean they're the most virtuous...

02:03:41,232 --> 02:03:45,230
But, any gentleman with an estate,
and 30,000 a year...

1254
02:03:46,028 --> 02:03:47,736
...should have a peerage.

And there standing behind me
was a total stranger.

1257
02:03:55,913 --> 02:03:58,238
I looked at him, and he said to me:

1258

"Excuse me, sir, could you tell me,
is Lord Wendover alive or dead?"

NARRATOR: The striving
after this peerage...

1263
02:04:14,515 --> 02:04:17,136
...was one of Barry's
most unlucky dealings.

1264
02:04:18,769 --> 02:04:21,439
He made great sacrifices
to bring it about.

1265
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:25,525
He lavished money here,
and diamonds there.

1266
02:04:27,111 --> 02:04:29,684
He bought lands
at ten times their value...

1267
02:04:29,989 --> 02:04:34,200
...purchased pictures and articles
of virtue at ruinous prices.

1268
02:04:35,619 --> 02:04:39,238
He gave entertainments
to those friends to his claim...

1269
02:04:39,957 --> 02:04:43,706
...all, being about the Royal person,
were likely to advance it.

1270
02:04:45,171 --> 02:04:50,165
And, I can tell you, bribes were
administered. And in high places, too.

that you would be astonished to know...

to receive his loans.

Your Majesty, may I present
Mr. Barry Lyndon.

1297
02:06:27,398 --> 02:06:30,683
Mr. Lyndon. We were very fond
of Sir Charles Lyndon.

She's very well, Your Majesty.

clever enough at gaining a fortune...

For the qualities and energies
which lead a man to achieve the first...

...are often the very cause of his ruin
in the latter case.

1307

Now he was burdened with
the harassing cares and responsibilities...

1308
02:07:19,491 --> 02:07:22,742
...which are the dismal adjuncts
of great rank and property.

1309
02:07:23,829 --> 02:07:25,157
And his life now...

1310
02:07:26,123 --> 02:07:30,666
...seemed to consist mostly of drafts
of letters to lawyers and money-brokers...

It means "an effort requiring strength."

What does "quadrangle" mean?

NARRATOR: If he had murdered
Lord Bullingdon...

...Barry could scarcely have been received
with more coldness and resentment...

...that now followed him
in town and country.

to his stepson.

Now all the bills came down
on him together.

All the bills he had been contracting
for the years of his marriage...

...and which the creditors sent in
with a hasty unanimity.

1418
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:00,981
Their amount was frightful.

1419
02:19:02,610 --> 02:19:06,738
Barry was now bound up in an
inextricable toil of bills and debts...

1420
02:19:07,782 --> 02:19:11,993
...of mortgages and insurances,
and all the evils attendant upon them.

that he was not a good and tender father.

He loved his son with a blind partiality.

He denied him nothing.

1439

It is impossible to convey
what high hopes he had for the boy...

1440

...and how he indulged
in a thousand fond anticipations...

...as to his future success
and figure in the world.

1442

But fate had determined that he should
leave none of his race behind him...

1443
02:21:15,284 --> 02:21:17,360
...that he should finish his life...

but I don't think he's worth that.

Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?

1716
02:48:21,742 --> 02:48:24,197
SIR RICHARD: Is your pistol cocked,
Mr. Lyndon?

1717
02:48:27,122 --> 02:48:28,071
Yes.

1718
02:48:33,378 --> 02:48:34,873
Then prepare to fire.

Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr. Lyndon
having fired into the ground...

1723
02:49:02,783 --> 02:49:06,068
...do you now consider
that you have received satisfaction?

[Dramatic instrumental beat

SIR RICHARD: Mr. Lyndon,
are you ready?

[Whispers] Yes.

1728
02:50:11,810 --> 02:50:13,637
SIR RICHARD: Lord Bullingdon...

1729
02:50:14,146 --> 02:50:16,601
...cock your pistol
and get ready to fire.

[Barry gasps]

I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Mr. Lyndon.

1739
02:51:46,613 --> 02:51:48,985
I'm afraid you'll have to lose the leg...

1740
02:51:49,825 --> 02:51:51,651
...most likely below the knee.

1741
02:52:00,585 --> 02:52:01,866
Lose the leg?

1742
02:52:03,588 --> 02:52:04,584
What for?

1743
02:52:06,842 --> 02:52:09,333
The simple answer is to save your life.

1744
02:52:10,762 --> 02:52:14,890
The ball has shattered the bone
below the knee and severed the artery.

1745
02:52:16,226 --> 02:52:19,346
Unless I amputate, there's no way
that I can repair the artery...

1746
02:52:19,437 --> 02:52:21,181
...and stop the hemorrhage.

Yes, My Lord?

1751
02:52:55,932 --> 02:53:00,559
When we arrive at Castle Hackton,
inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.

1752
02:53:01,479 --> 02:53:03,721
Don't go into any unnecessary detail.

1753
02:53:04,024 --> 02:53:07,973
Just tell her where he is
and that he has been wounded in the leg.

1754
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:10,611
She will want to go to him.

1755
02:53:11,239 --> 02:53:15,403
See that she is out of the house and
on her way to London as soon as possible.

1756
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:16,739
And in no event...

1757
02:53:16,828 --> 02:53:19,449
...is she to be allowed to see my mother...

1758
02:53:19,706 --> 02:53:22,992
...or create any disturbance at the house
before she leaves.

02:54:40,078 --> 02:54:42,616
MRS. BARRY: How nice
to see you, Graham. Come in.

1765
02:54:42,706 --> 02:54:43,785
Thank you.

1766

You... received my note?

1767

Yes, we were expecting you.

1768

Oh, good, I didn't want
to call unannounced.

Mr. Lyndon, how are you feeling?

I'm feeling much better,
thank you, Graham.

1771

Won't you sit down?

1772

GRAHAM: Are you comfortable here?

1778
02:55:33,631 --> 02:55:35,042
Most comfortable.

1779
02:55:35,133 --> 02:55:36,378
Good, good!

1780
02:55:50,732 --> 02:55:53,305
Shall we get down to the matter at hand?

1781

By all means.

GRAHAM: Mr. Lyndon...

...Lord Bullingdon has instructed me...

1784
02:56:10,960 --> 02:56:14,045
...to offer you an annuity...

1785
02:56:14,923 --> 02:56:18,707
...of 500 guineas a year for life.

1786
02:56:21,137 --> 02:56:24,257
Specifically on the condition of your...

1787
02:56:26,226 --> 02:56:27,850
...leaving England...

1788
02:56:28,478 --> 02:56:31,147

...the instant of your return.

1790
02:56:37,570 --> 02:56:41,650
Lord Bullingdon has also asked me
to point out to you...

1791
02:56:43,326 --> 02:56:45,947
...that should you decide to remain here...

1792
02:56:46,663 --> 02:56:50,411
...your stay would infallibly plunge you...

1793
02:56:52,126 --> 02:56:54,000
...into jail.

1794
02:56:55,672 --> 02:57:00,334
As in view of the present circumstances
there will soon be...

1795
02:57:01,344 --> 02:57:04,511
...innumerable writs taken out
against you for...

...debts long-outstanding...

1797
02:57:08,351 --> 02:57:11,020
...and your credit is so blown that...

1798
02:57:12,522 --> 02:57:14,182
...you could not hope...

and beaten...

...what was the lonely
and broken-hearted man to do?

1803
02:57:55,982 --> 02:57:59,730
He took the annuity and returned
to Ireland with his mother...

1804
02:58:00,403 --> 02:58:01,731
...to complete his recovery.

1805
02:58:03,573 --> 02:58:06,064
Sometime later he travelled abroad.

His life there, we have not the means
of following accurately.

1807
02:58:12,915 --> 02:58:16,450
He appears to have resumed
his former profession of a gambler...

1808
02:58:16,586 --> 02:58:18,543
...without his former success.

1809
