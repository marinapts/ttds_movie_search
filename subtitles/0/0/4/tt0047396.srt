Men, are you over 40?

3
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:25,195
When you wake up in the morning,
do you feel tired and rundown?

4
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,927
Do you have that listless feeling?

- Jefferies.
- (Man) Congratulations, Jeff.

10
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:06,286
- For what?
- Getting rid of that cast.

11
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,800
Who said I was getting rid of it?

(Man Over Telephone)
This is Wednesday.

13
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:14,279
Seven weeks from the day
you broke your leg. Yes or no?

14
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,722
(Jefferies) Gunnison, how did
you get to be such a big editor

15
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,718
with such a small memory?

16
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,878
Thrift, industry and hard work...

17
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,880
and catching the publisher
with his secretary.

18
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:26,038
- Did I get the wrong day?
- (Jefferies) No.

19
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,195
No, wrong week.

20
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:33,122
Next Wednesday I emerge from this...
plaster cocoon.

21
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:37,803
That's too bad, Jeff.
Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day.

22
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,195
Forget I called.

23
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,835
(Jefferies) Yeah, I sure feel
sorry for you, Gunnison.

24
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,916
Must be rough on you thinking of me
wearing this cast for another week.

25
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,681
That one week is gonna cost
me my best photographer,

26
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,644
and you a big assignment.

27
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:51,796
Where?

28
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,719
(Gunnison) There's no point
in even talking about it.

29
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,559
(Jefferies)
Oh, come on, come on. Where?

30
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:59,402
Kashmir. Got a code tip from
the bureau chief this morning.

31
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,398
The place is about to go up in smoke.

32
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,445
What did I tell you? Didrt I tell
you that's the next place to watch?

33
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:07,201
- (Gunnison) You did.
- (Jefferies) When do I leave? Hour?

34
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:11,565
- With that cast on? You don't.
- Stop sounding stuffy.

35
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:15,402
I can take pictures from a jeep
or a water buffalo, if necessary.

36
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,604
(Gunnison) You're too valuable to the
magazine for us to play around with.

37
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,281
- I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
- (Jefferies) Morgan or Lambert.

38
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,085
That's fine.

39
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,556
I get myself half-killed for you,

40
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:27,922
and you reward me
by stealing my assignments.

41
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,726
(Gunnison) I didn't ask you to stand in
the middle of an automobile racetrack.

42
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:34,844
(Jefferies) You asked for something
dramatically different.

43
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:37,441
- You got it.
- (Gunnison) So did you.

44
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,518
- Goodbye, Jeff.
- Now, wait a minute, Gunnison.

45
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,484
You've got to get me out of here.

46
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:44,037
Six weeks sitting
in a two-room apartment

47
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,357
with nothing to do but look out
the window at the neighbours.

48
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,199
- Bye, Jeff.
- No, Gunnison, I...

49
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,720
If you don't pull me out
of this swamp of boredom,

50
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm gonna do something drastic.

51
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,683
- (Gunnison) Like what?
- (Jefferies) "Like what?" Get married.

52
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,724
Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.

53
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,206
(Gunnison)
It's about time you got married,

54
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:03,758
before you turn into
a lonesome and bitter, old man.

55
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:05,963
Yeah, can't you just see me?

56
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:08,883
Rushing home to a hot apartment

57
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:12,881
to listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher

58
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:17,359
and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife.

59
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:20,758
(Gunnison) Jeff, wives don't nag
any more, they discuss.

60
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,157
(Jeff) Is that so? Is that so?

61
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,716
Maybe in the high-rent district
they discuss.

62
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,957
In my neighbourhood, they still nag.

63
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:31,961
(Gunnison) Well, you know best.
I'll call you later.

64
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:36,166
Yeah, have some good news
the next time, huh?

(Arguing, Indistinct)

66
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,276
(Woman)
Good morning. I said, "Good morning!"

67
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:31,039
Oh, good morning.

(Children Laughing, Playing)

69
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:50,919
Say, I wouldn't dig so deep
if I were you.

70
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,757
You're giving them far too much water.

71
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,565
Why don't you shut up?

72
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,086
Well!

73
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,720
I do declare.

74
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:07,276
(Woman) State sentence
for a peeping tom,

75
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:08,960
is six months in the workhouse.

76
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:10,401
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

77
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,956
They got no windows in the workhouse.

78
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:16,802
In the old days, they used to put
your eyes out with a red-hot poker.

79
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:19,879
Any of those bikini bombshells
you're always watching

80
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,605
won'th a red-hot poker?

81
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,564
Oh, dear.

82
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:26,321
We've become a race of Peeping Toms.

83
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,603
What people ought to do
is get outside their own house

84
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,246
and look in for a change.

85
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:33,922
Yes, sir. How's that for
a bit of homespun philosophy?

86
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,317
Reader's Digest, April 1939.

87
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:38,762
Well, I only quote from the best.

88
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:40,645
You don't have to take
my temperature this morning.

89
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,367
Quiet. See if you can break 100.

90
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,722
You know, I should have been
a gypsy fortune-teller

91
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:48,082
instead of an insurance company nurse.

92
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:52,035
I got a nose for trouble.
Can smell it ten miles away.

93
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:56,166
You heard of that market crash in '29?
I predicted that.

94
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,438
Just how did you do that, Stella?

95
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:03,203
Oh, simple. I was nursing
a director of General Motors.

96
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:07,519
"Kidney ailment," they said.
"Nerves," I said.

97
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:09,006
Then I asked myself,

98
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,204
"W hat's General Motors
got to be nervous about?"

99
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,518
"Overproduction," I says. "Collapse."

100
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,918
When General Motors has to go
to the bathroom ten times a day,

101
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,317
the whole country's ready to let go.

102
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,396
You know, Stella,
in economics, a kidney ailment

103
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,205
has no relationship to the stock market.

104
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:30,285
- None whatsoever.
- (Stella) Crashed, didn't it?

105
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:33,484
I can smell trouble
right here in this apartment.

106
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,046
First you smash your leg,

107
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,960
then you get
to looking out the window,

108
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,038
see things you shouldn't see.

109
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,925
Trouble.

110
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,725
I can see you in court now

111
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:47,038
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double-breasted suits.

112
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,196
You're pleading.

113
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:52,155
You say, "Judge,
it was only a bit of innocent fun.

114
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:55,046
I love my neighbours, like a father."

115
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,277
And the judge says,
"Well, congratulations.

116
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:00,564
You've just given birth
to three years in Dannamora."

117
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,116
Right now, I'd welcome trouble.

118
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:04,720
You've got a hormone deficiency.

119
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,400
How can you tell from a thermometer?

120
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,319
Those bathing beauties
you've been watching

121
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:12,719
haven't raised your temperature
one degree in a month.

122
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,558
Here we go.

123
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,643
(Sighs) One more week.

124
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,638
(Groans) I think you're right.

125
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:29,763
I think there is gonna be
trouble around here.

126
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:31,280
I knew it.

127
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:34,484
Ooh. Do you ever heat that stuff?

128
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:37,445
Gives your
circulation something to fight.

129
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:40,758
- What kind of trouble?
- Lisa Fremont.

130
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:43,361
You kidding?
She's a beautiful, young girl,

131
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:46,360
and you're a reasonably
healthy young man.

132
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,087
- She expects me to marry her.
- That's normal.

133
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,317
- I don't want to.
- That's abnormal.

134
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:53,762
I'm just not ready for marriage.

135
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:56,919
Every mars ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along.

136
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,601
Lisa Fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain

137
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,086
who can get one eye open.

138
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,680
She's alright.

139
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,997
- What did you do, have a fight?
- No.

140
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,681
- Father loading up the shotgun?
- What?

141
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,077
- Please, Stella.
- It's happened before, you know.

142
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:12,761
Some of the world's
happiest marriages have

143
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,918
started 'under the gun,'
as you might say.

144
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,806
- No, she's just not the girl for me.
- Yeah, she's only perfect.

145
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,958
She's too perfect. She's too talented.

146
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,516
She's too beautiful.
She's too sophisticated.

147
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,917
She's too everything, but what I want.

148
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,204
Is what you want
something you can discuss?

149
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,437
What? It's very simple, Stella.

150
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,043
She belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue:

151
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,563
expensive restaurants
and literary cocktail parties.

152
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,558
People with sense
belong wherever they're put.

153
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:42,446
Can you imagine her tramping around
the world with a camera bum

154
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,837
who never has more than
a week's salary in the bank?

155
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:47,362
If she was only ordinary.

156
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,839
You never gonna get married?

157
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,725
I'll probably get married
one of these days,

158
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:54,276
but when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

159
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,599
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner

160
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,837
and the latest scandal.

161
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:04,044
I need a woman who's willing to...
Hold it.

162
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:07,882
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

163
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:11,244
So the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off.

164
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,079
Let her find somebody else.

165
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:15,078
Yeah, I can hear you now.

166
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:18,956
"Get out of my life,
you perfectly wonderful woman."

167
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,118
Look, Mr Jefferies,
I'm not an educated woman,

168
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,164
but I can tell you one thing.

169
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,444
When a man and a woman see
each other and like each other,

170
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,518
they ought to come together, wham,

171
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:30,439
like a couple of taxis on Broadway

172
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:32,996
and not sit around analysing each other

173
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,805
like two specimens in a bottle.

174
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,845
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

175
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,076
Intelligence.

176
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:42,842
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

177
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,282
(Laughs) Modern marriage.

178
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:49,076
- No, we've progressed emotionally.
- Baloney.

179
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,726
Once it was see somebody,
get excited, get married.

180
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,206
Now, it's read a lot of books,

181
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,837
fence with a lot of four-syllable
words, psychoanalyse each other

182
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,486
until you can't tell the difference

183
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,605
between a petting party
and a civil service exam.

184
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:07,241
People have different emotional levels -

185
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:10,797
When I married Myles, we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits.

186
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:16,087
We are still maladjusted, and we
have loved every minute of it.

187
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:17,282
Well, that's fine, Stella.

188
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,244
Now, would you
fix me a sandwich, please?

189
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:23,241
Yes, I will. And I'll spread
a little common sense on the bread.

190
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:26,126
Lisa's loaded to her fingertips
with love for you.

191
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:29,006
I got two words of advice
for you: Marry her.

192
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,727
- She pay you much?
- Oh.

193
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,878
(Chuckling)

194
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,964
There you are.

195
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,206
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.

196
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:05,484
Well, if you want anything, just ring.

197
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,886
Honey.

198
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,800
Come on.

199
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,605
Got to carry you over the threshold.

200
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,598
Window shopper.

201

(Children Shouting Playfully)

204
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,798
How's your leg?

205
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,798
It hurts a little.

206
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:48,755
- And your stomach?
- Empty as a football.

207
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,637
And your love life?

208
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:55,037
Not too active.

209
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:57,402
Anything else bothering you?

210
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,478
Mm-hm.

211
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:01,638
Who are you?

212
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,318
Reading from top to bottom:

213
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,480
Lisa...

214
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,160
Carol...

215
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,446
Fremont.

216
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:21,964
Is this the Lisa Fremont who
never wears the same dress twice?

217
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,687
Only because it's expected of her.

218
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:26,803
It's right off the Paris plane.

219
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,879
- Do you think it'll sell?
- That depends on the quote.

220
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,083
Let's see now.
There's the aeroplane ticket over,

221
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:34,238
import duties, hidden taxes,

222
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:37,205
- profit markup -
- A steal at $1,100.

223
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,597
Eleven hundred?

224
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,122
They ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange.

225
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,881
We sell a dozen a day
in this price range.

226
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,446
Who buys them, tax collectors?

227
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,598
Even if I had to pay,
it would be won'th it.

228
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:51,839
- Just for the occasion.
- Why, is something big going on?

229
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:54,441
It's going on right here. It's a big night.

230
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:57,883
It's just an old
run-of-the-mill Wednesday.

231
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,446
The calendar's full of them.

232
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:04,317
It's opening night of the last depressing
week of L B Jefferies in a cast.

233
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,957
Well, I haven't noticed
a big demand for tickets.

234
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,800
That's because I bought out the house.

235
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:14,437
You know, this cigarette box
has seen better days.

236
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,804
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

237
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,162
It's cracked and you never use it.

238
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,045
It's too ornate.

239
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,756
I'm sending up a plain, flat,
silver one with your initials.

240
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:28,395
That's no way to spend
your hard-earned money.

241
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,398
I wanted to.

242
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,160
Ooh!

243
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,995
What would you think of
starting off with dinner at '21 '?

244
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,806
You have, perhaps,
an ambulance downstairs?

245
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:41,800
No, better than that: '21 '.

246
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:50,157
Thank you for waiting, Carl.
The kitchers right there on the left.

247
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,318
I'll take the wine.

248
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,279
- Good evening, Mr Jefferies.
- Carl.

249
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:59,484
Just put everything
in the oven, Carl, on low.

250
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,559
- Let's open the wine now.
- (Jeff) Alright.

251
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,480
- It's a Montrachet.
- A great big glassful.

252
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,639
There's a corkscrew right over there.

253
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,638
Here, I'll do it.

254
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,475
- Big enough?
- Yeah, they're fine.

255
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,036
I can't think of anything more
boring or tiresome

256
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:20,438
than what you've been through
and the last week must be the hardest.

257
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:24,725
Alright. Yeah, I want to get
this thing off and get moving.

258
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:29,039
Well, I'm going to make this
a week you'll never forget.

259
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:32,557
Fine, thanks.

260
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,479
Just a minute, Carl.

261
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,286
- This will take care of the taxi.
- Thank you, Miss Fremont.

262
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:41,963
- Have a pleasant dinner, Mr Jefferies.
- Alright, Good night.

263
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,446
Good night.

264
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:46,641
What a day I've had.

265
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:49,116
- Are you tired?
- Not a bit.

266
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,766
I was all morning in a meeting,

267
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,283
then I had to dash to the Waldorf
for a quick drink with Madam Dufrene,

268
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:57,757
who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

269
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:02,595
Then I had to go to '21' and have lunch
with the Harper's Bazaar people.

270
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,519
That's when I ordered dinner.

271
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,565
Then I had two fall showings
20 blocks apart.

272
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:09,763
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

273
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,645
We're trying to get his new show.

274
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,525
Then I had to dash back and change.

275
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:17,919
Well, now, tell me,
what was Mrs Hayward wearing?

276
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,839
- She looked wonderfully cool.
- She didn't, did she?

277
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,885
She had on the most divine
Italian hand-printed -

278
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,038
- Oh, Italian?
- Oh, you.

279
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,597
- Italian. Imagine.
- To think I planted three nice items

280
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,962
- in the columns about you today.
- You did?

281
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,199
- You can't buy that kind of publicity.
- I know.

282
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:38,042
Someday you may want to
open up a studio of your own here.

283
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:41,244
How would I run it from, say, Pakistan?

284
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,399
Jeff...

285
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:48,801
Isn't it time you came home?
You could pick your assignment.

286
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,038
- I wish there was one I wanted.
- Make the one you want.

287
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,845
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.

288
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,965
- For what?
- For yourself and me.

289
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,919
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow:

290
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,839
- Fashions, portraits.
- (Chuckles)

291
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:06,397
- Now, don't laugh. I could do it.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

292
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,764
Can you see me driving down
to the fashion salon in a jeep

293
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:13,886
wearing combat boots and a three-day
beard? Wouldrt that make a hit?

294
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,805
I could see you looking
very handsome and successful

295
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,844
in a dark blue, flannel suit.

296
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,079
Let's stop talking nonsense, shall we?

297
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:23,680
Hm?

298
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,002
Guess I'd better
start setting up for dinner.

299
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:41,079

319
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:45,280

321
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:53,244

At least that's something
you'll never have to worry about.

329
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,115
Oh?

330
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,882
You can see my apartment from here,
all the way up on 63rd Street?

331
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:40,925
No, not exactly,
but we have a little apartment here

332
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:43,203
that's probably as popular as yours.

333
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:47,599
You remember, of course,
Miss Torso, the ballet dancer?

334
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:51,555
She's like a queen bee
with her pick of the drones.

337
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:12,204
Thank you.

338
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:26,165
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

339
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:29,125
She's not in love with him...
or any of them.

340
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:32,040
Oh, how can you tell that from here?

341
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,880
You said it resembled
my apartment, didn't you?

342
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,761
I hope they're cooked this time.

Where's that
wonderful music coming from?

348
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:21,158
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

349
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:22,555
Well...

350
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:24,445
He lives alone.

351
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:28,077
Probably had a very unappy marriage.

352
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:30,363
Oh, it's enchanting.

353
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:36,122
It's almost as if it were
being written especially for us.

354
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,279
Hm. No wonder he's having
so much trouble with it.

355
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:44,839
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

There can't be that much difference
between people and the way they live.

00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:08,162
We all eat, talk, drink,
laugh, wear clothes.

360
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:09,646
Well, now look -

361
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,116
If you're saying all this because
you don't want to tell me the truth,

362
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,755
because you're hiding something from
me, then maybe I can understand.

363
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:16,485
I'm not hiding anything. It's just that -

364
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:17,875
It doesn't make sense.

365
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,039
What's so different about it here
from there or anyplace you go

366
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,516
that one person couldn't live
in both places just as easily?

367
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:25,120
Some people can.
Now, if you'll just let me -

368
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,120
What is it but travelling from
one place to another taking pictures?

369
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,357
It's like being a tourist
on an endless vacation.

370
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:32,802
OK. That's your opinion.
You're entitled to it.

371
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,764
- Now, let me give you my side.
- It's ridiculous to say

372
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,636
that it can only be done by a special,
private little group of anointed people.

373
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,765
I made a simple statement,
a true statement,

374
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,395
but I can back it up if you'll just
shut up for a minute.

375
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,359
If your opinion is as rude as your
manner, I don't think I care to hear it.

376
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:50,358
Oh, come on now. Simmer down.

377
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,916
I can't fit in here. You can't fit in there.

378
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:55,043
According to you, people
should be born, live and die

- Shut up!

- Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
- Of course not.

381
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,317
Well, you might have to
if you went with me.

382
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,843
Did you ever try to keep warm
in a C-54 at 15,000 feet,

383
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,998
20 degrees below zero?

384
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,646
Oh, I do it all the time,

385
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,559
whenever I have
a few minutes after lunch.

386
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,604
Did you ever get shot at? Run over?

387
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:18,882
Did you ever get sandbagged

388
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:22,039
because somebody got unfavourable
publicity from your camera?

389
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:25,086
Did you ever... Those high heels,
they'll be great in the jungle.

390
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:27,158
And the nylons
and those six-ounce lingerie.

391
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:28,965
- Three.
- Alright, three.

392
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:32,119
They'll make a big hit in Finland,
just before you freeze to death.

393
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:35,677
Well, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to wear the proper clothes.

394
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:36,836
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:40,522
Well, try and find a raincoat in Brazil,
even when it isn't raining.

396
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:43,963
Lisa, in this job you carry one suitcase.

397
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,402
Your home
is the available transportation.

398
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,478
You don't sleep very much.
You bathe less.

399
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,717
And sometimes the food that you eat

400
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,640
is made from things that you couldn't
even look at when they're alive.

401
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,877
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.

402
00:27:58,047 --> 00:28:00,845
Deliberately repulsive?
I'm trying to make it sound good.

403
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:04,283
You just have to face it, Lisa,
you're not meant for that kind of a life.

404
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,841
Few people are.

405
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:12,562
- You're too stubborn to argue with.
- I'm not stubborn. I'm just truthful.

406
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:16,083
I know, a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday,

407
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:19,876
and I would have awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

408
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,526
Well, now, wait a minute.

409
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:25,801
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be happy to accommodate you.

410
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:31,803
No, I don't particularly want that.

411
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,886
So that's it?

412
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,197
You won't stay here,
and I can't go with you.

413
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,765
It would be the wrong thing.

414
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,595
You don't think either one
of us could ever change?

415
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:48,038
Right now it doesn't seem so.

416
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,365
l-I'm in love with you.

417
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:57,963
I don't care what you do for a living.

418
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,436
I'd like to be part of it somehow.

419
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:05,565
It's deflating to find out
the only way I can be part of it,

420
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:09,845
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine.

421
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,884
I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.

422
00:29:13,207 --> 00:29:14,720
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa.

423
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,640
You've got this town
in the palm of your hand.

424
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:21,443
Not quite, it seems.

couldn't we just...

429
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:36,640
Couldrt we just...
keep things status quo?

430

Without any future?

431
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,679
Well, when am I gonna see you again?

432
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:46,923

would have cooled things off.

'eat, drink and be merry' girl.

468
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:06,886
Yeah, she'll wind up fat,
alcoholic and miserable.

469
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:08,446
Yeah.

470
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:11,565
Speaking of misery,
poor Miss Lonelyhearts.

471
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,560
She drank herself to sleep again, alone.

472
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:18,640
Poor soul. Maybe one day
she'll find her happiness.

473
00:36:18,807 --> 00:36:21,321
Yeah, and some man will lose his.

474
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:22,715
Isn't there anybody in the
neighbourhood

475
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,684
who could cast an eye in her direction?

476
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:26,678
Well...

477
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:29,964
It might just be that the salesman
will be available soon.

478
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:31,958
Oh, him and his wife splitting up?

479
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:33,685
I just can't figure it.

480
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,042
He went out several times
last night in the rain,

481
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,279
- carrying his sample case.
- Well, he's a salesman, isn't he?

482
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,722
What would he be selling
at three o'clock in the morning?

483
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:45,084
Flashlights.
Luminous dials for watches.

484
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:47,636
House numbers that light up.

485
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:49,286
I don't think so.

486
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:50,926
I don't think so.

487
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,403
I think he was taking
something out of the apartment.

488
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:57,162
Uh-huh. His personal effects.

489
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,405
He's gonna run out on her, the coward.

490
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:04,764
Yeah. Sometimes it's worse
to stay than it is to run.

491
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:10,718
Yeah, well, it takes a particularly low
type of man to do a thing like that.

492
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:12,599
How about this morning?

493
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,644
Any further developments?

494
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:17,198
The shades are all drawn
in the apartment.

495
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,164
- In this heat?
- Yeah.

496
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,517
Well, they're up now.

497

# (Woman Vocalising)

498
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:29,126
- Get back! Get back.
- Where do you want me to go?

499
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:32,040
- Come on, get out of sight.
- What's the matter?

500
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,163
That salesmars looking out of
his window. You see?

501
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:36,719
Get back! He'll see you.

502
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,878
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.

503
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:41,561
(Jeff) That's no ordinary look.

504
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,319
That's the kind of look a man gives

505
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:46,284
when he's afraid somebody
might be watching him.

506

(Dog Whimpering)

507
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,926
(Woman) Get away from there.

508
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,317
He'll be after you.
Go on, into the house.

509
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,478
Into the house. Shoo, shoo.

510
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,797
Goodbye, Mr Jefferies.
See you tomorrow.

- Uh-huh.

513
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:30,323
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh."
Great conversationalist.

Stella...

515
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:37,486
Take those binoculars out
and bring them here, will you?

516
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,126
Trouble.

517
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:41,357
I can smell it.

518
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,405
I'll be glad when they crack
that cast, and I can get outta here.

519
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,398
Uh-huh.

How far does a girl have to go
before you'll notice her?

526
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:19,876
Well, if she's pretty enough,
she doesn't have to go anywhere.

527
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:22,003
She just has to 'be.'

528
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,044
Well, ain't I?

529
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:26,243
Pay attention to me.

530
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:31,797
I'm not exactly
on the other side of the room.

531
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:36,597
Your mind is... and when
I want a man, I want all of him.

532
00:42:40,407 --> 00:42:43,240
Don't you ever have any problems?

533
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,443
I have one now.

534
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,999
So do I.

535
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,002
Tell me about it.

536
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:54,519
Why?

537
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:58,443
Why would a man leave
his apartment three times

538
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:03,317
on a rainy night with a suitcase,
and come back three times?

539
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:07,196
He likes the way his wife
welcomes him home.

540
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,881
No, no. Not this salesmars wife.

541
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:11,958
And why didn't he go to work today?

542
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:15,642
Homework. It's more interesting.

543
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:20,119
What's interesting about a butcher knife

544
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:22,676
and a small saw

545
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,436
wrapped in newspaper?

546
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:27,484
Nothing, thank heaven.

547
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,445
Why hasn't he been
in his wife's bedroom all day?

548
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,360
I wouldn't dare answer that.

549
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:36,641
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.

550
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:40,243
There's something terribly wrong.

551
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:45,358
- (Lisa) And I'm afraid it's with me.
- What do you think?

552
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:50,277
Something too frightful to utter.

553
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:53,598
(Jeff) He went out a few minutes
ago in his undershirt, hasn't come back.

554
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:09,360
That would be a terrible job to tackle.

# (Piano)

556
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:17,607
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

557
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:23,798
Jeff, I'll be honest with you.
You're beginning to scare me.

558
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:30,196
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare -

559
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,720
Shh! He's coming back!

560
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:02,006
- Jeff, if you could only see yourself!
- What's the matter?

561
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,556
Sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing,

562
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:07,116
but doing it the way
you are with binoculars

563
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,200
and wild opinions about every
little thing you see is diseased!

564
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:13,722
Do you think I consider it recreation?

565
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:15,639
I don't know what you consider it,

566
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:17,877
but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

567
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,197
- What's the -
- What is it you're looking for?

568
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,881
I just want to find out what's
the matter with the salesmars wife.

569
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:24,685
Does that make me
sound like a madman?

570
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,485
What makes you think there's
something the matter with her?

571
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:29,923
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.

572
00:45:30,087 --> 00:45:35,320
Yet not the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

573
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:38,486
- Maybe she died.
- (Jeff) Where's the doctor?

574
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:39,796
Where's the undertaker?

575
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,527
She could be sleeping, under sedatives.

576
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:45,884
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

577
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,958
There is something.
I've seen it through that window.

578
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:50,880
I've seen bickering and family quarrels

579
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:52,116
and mysterious trips at night

580
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:54,039
and knives and saws and rope.

581
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:57,165
Now, since last evening, not a sign
of the wife. Tell me where she is.

582
00:45:57,327 --> 00:45:58,999
- I don't know.
- What's she doing?

583
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,125
Maybe he's leaving his wife.
I don't know. I don't care!

584
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:05,359
Lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses.

585
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:08,087
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

586
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:10,636
Lots of wives nag and
men hate them and trouble starts,

587
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:14,561
but few of them end up in murder,
if that's what you're thinking.

588
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:16,957
It's pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word, isn't it?

589
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:19,083
You could see all that he did,
couldn't you?

590
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:21,283
- Of course, I -
- You could see cos the shades were up

591
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:24,917
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

592
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:26,076
I've seen him -

593
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:28,841
Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

594
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:31,726
That he wouldn't pull the shades
down and hide behind them?

595
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:33,764
He's being clever. He's being nonchalant.

596
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,963
And that's
where you're not bring clever.

597
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,278
A murderer would never parade
his crime in front of an open window.

598
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:40,436
Why not?

599
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:43,883
For all you know, there's
something sinister going on there.

600
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:47,116
Where? Oh.

601
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:50,716
(Laughs) No comment.

602
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,962
Let's start
from the beginning again, Jeff.

603
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:19,039
Tell me everything you saw

604
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:22,279
and what you think it means.

605
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:34,485
- (Telephone Rings)
- Yeah?

606
00:47:34,647 --> 00:47:36,046
(Lisa) "The name on the second floor

607
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:39,199
rear mail box reads,
'Mr and Mrs Lars'."

608
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,722
"That's L-a-r-s."

609
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:43,718
"Lars Thorwald."

610
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:45,286
What's the number of the apartment?

611
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:48,962
(Lisa) "125 West Ninth Street."

612
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:50,242
Thank you, dear.

613
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:52,557
(Lisa) "OK, chief.
What's my next assignment?"

614
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:54,718
Just go home.

615
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:57,401
(Lisa)
"Alright, but what's he doing now?"

616
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:01,242
He's just sitting
in the living room in the dark.

617
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:03,875
Hasrt gone near the bedroom.

618
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,800
Now you go home
and get some sleep. Good night.

619

(Lisa) "Good night."

(Man) "What's it about, Jeff?"

621
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,519
Look, Doyle,
I can't tell you over the phone.

622
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:23,962
You have to be here
and see the whole set-up.

623
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:28,200
It's probably nothing.
It's just a little neighbourhood murder.

624
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:31,279
- (Doyle) "Did you say murder?"
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

625
00:48:31,447 --> 00:48:32,516
(Doyle) "Oh, come now."

626
00:48:32,687 --> 00:48:35,155
My only thought was throwing a little
business your way, that's all.

627
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,478
I figured a detective would jump at
the chance of something to detect.

628
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,285
- (Doyle) "I'm not working."
- What?

629
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,721
(Doyle)
"This happens to be my day off."

630
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:44,640
I usually took my best pictures
on my day off.

631
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:48,356
- (Doyle) "I'll drop by."
- OK, Doyle. As soon as you can.

632
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,604
Bless your heart, Stella.

633
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,359
Gee whiz, look at this.

634
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:55,802
I can't tell you
what a welcome sight this is.

635
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,366
No wonder your husband still loves you.

636
00:48:57,527 --> 00:48:58,926
- The police.
- What?

637
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:02,124
- You called the police.
- Well, not exactly.

638
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:05,438
Not an official call.
It's an old friend of mine.

639
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:08,565
An old, ornery friend of mine.

640
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:12,800
Just where do you suppose
he cut her up?

641
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:16,198
Of course. The bathtub.

642
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:21,282
That's the only place where
he could have washed away the blood.

643
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:33,443
He better get that trunk out
of there before it starts to leak.

644
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:39,086
(Children Playing)

645
00:49:52,927 --> 00:49:55,395
(Newlywed Wife) Harry?

646
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,085
Look, look, Mr Jefferies.

647
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:39,677
I thought Doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left,

648
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:42,042
or I'd have called the police.
Now we're gonna lose it.

649
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:43,845
- Hold everything.
- Don't do anything foolish.

650
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,599
I'm just gonna get the name
off that freight truck.

651
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,406
I'll keep an eye on the alley.

652
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,246
Long distance.

653
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:07,879
(Truck Departing)

654
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:29,837
You didn't see the killing or the body.
How do you know there was a murder?

655
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:32,840
Because everything this fellow's done
has been suspicious:

656
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,363
Trips at night in the rain,
knives and saws and trunks with rope,

657
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,518
and now this wife
that isn't there any more.

658
00:51:38,687 --> 00:51:41,326
I admit it all has a mysterious sound.

659
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:45,036
It could be any number of things.
Murder's the least possible.

660
00:51:45,207 --> 00:51:47,084
Doyle, don't tell me
he's an unemployed magician,

661
00:51:47,247 --> 00:51:48,999
amusing the neighbourhood
with his sleight of hand.

662
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,202
Don't tell me that.

663
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:52,403
It's too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder.

664
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,205
In full view of 50 windows?

665
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:56,756
Then sit there smoking a cigar,
waiting for the police to pick him up.

666
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:59,441
Alright, officer, do your duty.
Go over and pick him up.

667
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:02,644
Jeff, you've got a lot
to learn about homicide.

668
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:04,604
Why, morons have committed
murder so shrewdly,

669
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:07,998
it's taken a hundred trained
police minds to catch them.

670
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,362
That salesman wouldn't just
knock his wife off after dinner

671
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,916
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage.

672
00:52:13,287 --> 00:52:14,481
I'll bet it's been done.

673
00:52:14,647 --> 00:52:17,798
Most everything's been done...
under panic.

674
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:19,639
This is a thousand-to-one shot.

675
00:52:19,807 --> 00:52:22,446
He's still sitting around the apartment.
That mars not panicked.

676
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:25,083
You think I made all this up?

677
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:26,965
Well, I think you saw something

678
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:29,482
there's probably
a very simple explanation for.

679
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,400
- For instance?
- Wife took a trip.

680
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:34,319
His wife was sick in bed.

681
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,322
Yeah, so you told me.

682
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:41,721
Well, Jeff, I've got to run along.

683
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:47,917
I won't report this to the department.
Let me poke into it a little on my own.

684
00:52:48,087 --> 00:52:50,555
No sense in your getting
a lot of ridiculous publicity.

685
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:52,001
Thank you.

686
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:57,040
We know the wife is gone,
so I'll see if I can find out where.

687
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,526
Do that.

688
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:01,637
You had any headaches lately?

689
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:03,126
Not till you showed up.

690
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,045
It will wear off,
along with the hallucinations.

691
00:53:07,207 --> 00:53:08,356
See you around.

692
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:13,682
(Dog Whining)

693
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:34,606
- Get along.
- (Barks)

694
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:55,082
He has a six months' lease.

695
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:58,045
Used up a little more than
five and a half months of it.

696
00:53:58,207 --> 00:54:00,482
He's quiet,
drinks, but not to drunkenness.

697
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:02,205
Pays his bills promptly
with money earned

698
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:05,006
as a costume jewellery salesman:
wholesale.

699
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:08,000
Kept to himself. No neighbours
got close to him or his wife.

700
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:09,839
Yeah, well, I think
they missed their chance with her.

701
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:12,760
She never left the apartment,
until yesterday morning.

702
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:15,077
- What time?
- 6:00am.

703
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:17,283
6:00am.

704
00:54:17,447 --> 00:54:20,280
I think that's
about the time I fell asleep.

705
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:21,721
Too bad.

706
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:25,721
Thorwalds were leaving
their apartment at just that time.

707
00:54:26,527 --> 00:54:28,597
Feel a little foolish?

708
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:30,758
No, not yet.

709
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:44,757
- How's your wife?
- Oh, she's fine.

710
00:54:48,007 --> 00:54:49,235
Who said they left then?

711
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:53,280
- W-Who left where?
- (Jeff) The Thorwalds, at 6:00am.

712
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:56,120
Oh, the building superintendent
and two tenants.

713
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:59,006
Flat statements, no hesitation.
They jived with the letter.

714
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,476
Thorwalds were on their way
to the railroad station.

715
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:04,844
Well, now, Tom, how could
anybody possibly guess that?

716
00:55:05,007 --> 00:55:06,725
What, did they have signs
on their luggage saying,

717
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,115
'Grand Central, or bust'?

718
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:11,641
The superintendent
met Thorwald on his way back.

719
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,685
Thorwald told him that he'd put
his wife on a train to the country.

720
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:17,725
I see. I'd say this is a pretty
convenient guy, this superintendent.

721
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:20,082
Have you checked
his bank statements lately?

722
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:25,437
- Huh?
- Well, what good's his information?

723
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:29,481
It's a secondhand version of
an unsupported story by the murderer.

724
00:55:29,647 --> 00:55:33,083
Now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train?

725
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,876
I hate to remind you,

726
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:36,958
but this all started because
you said she was murdered.

727
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,241
Now, did anyone, including you,
actually see her murdered?

728
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:42,363
(Stammering) What are you doing?

729
00:55:42,527 --> 00:55:45,758
Are you interested in solving
this case or making me look foolish?

730
00:55:46,807 --> 00:55:48,365
Well, if possible, both.

731
00:55:48,527 --> 00:55:50,165
Then do a good job of it.

732
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:51,999
Go over there and search
Thorwald's apartment.

733
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,600
It must be knee-deep in evidence.

734
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,041
I can't do that.

735
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:57,562
(Jeff) I don't mean right now,
but when he goes out for a drink,

736
00:55:57,727 --> 00:55:59,797
or a paper, or something.
What he doesn't know won't hurt him.

737
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:01,639
I can't do that even if he isn't there.

738
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:03,957
(Stammering) What's he...

739
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,641
Does he have a courtesy card from
the police department or something?

740
00:56:06,807 --> 00:56:08,718
Now don't get me mad.

741
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:11,879
Not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it.

742
00:56:12,047 --> 00:56:14,880
If I were caught in there, they'd
have my badge within ten minutes.

743
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:17,117
(Jeff) Make sure
you don't get caught, that's all.

744
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:19,887
If you find something,
you've got a murderer,

745
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:21,526
and they don't care about
a couple of house rules.

746
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:23,598
If you don't find anything,
the fellow's clear.

747
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:25,723
At the risk of sounding stuffy,

748
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:29,277
I'd like to remind you
of the Constitution and the phrase,

749
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:32,837
'search warrant issued by a judge'
who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim.

750
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:36,283
- He must ask for evidence.
- Give him evidence.

751
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,605
Yeah, I can hear myself,

752
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:44,602
"Your Honour, I have a friend
who's an amateur sleuth."

753
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:47,804
"The other night, after
having a heavy dinner, he..."

754
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:50,800
He'd throw the New York State
penal code in my face,

755
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,082
and there's six volumes.

756
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:55,801
By tomorrow morning there
may not be any evidence left

757
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:57,605
over in that apartment, you know that.

758
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,486
It's a detective's nightmare.

759
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,878
(Stammering) What do you need
before you can search?

760
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:04,275
Tell me now, what do you need?

761
00:57:04,447 --> 00:57:06,483
Bloody footsteps
leading up to the door?

762
00:57:06,647 --> 00:57:10,276
One thing I don't need is heckling.
You called me and asked for help.

763
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:13,439
Now you're behaving like a taxpayer.

764
00:57:13,607 --> 00:57:15,518
How did we ever
stand each other in that plane

765
00:57:15,687 --> 00:57:16,881
for three years during the war?

766
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:18,275
# (Woman Vocalising)

767
00:57:19,487 --> 00:57:21,045
I guess I'll go over
to the railroad station

768
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:22,720
and check on Thorwald's story.

769
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:24,115
(Jeff) Oh, forget about the story.

770
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:26,517
Find the trunk. Mrs Thorwald's in it.

771
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:28,566
Oh, I almost forgot.

772
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:32,197
There was a postcard
in Thorwald's mailbox. It was...

- What'd you do to your hair?
- Oh, I just -

840
01:03:34,527 --> 01:03:37,564
Take a look at Thorwald.
He's getting ready to pull out.

841
01:03:42,047 --> 01:03:43,526
He doesn't seem to be in any hurry.

842
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:46,121
He's been laying out all
his things on one of the beds:

843
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:48,357
Shirts, suits, coats, socks.

844
01:03:48,527 --> 01:03:52,725
Even that alligator handbag
his wife left on the bedpost.

845
01:03:52,887 --> 01:03:55,526
He had it hidden in the dresser.
At least, it was there.

846
01:03:55,687 --> 01:03:59,362
He took it out, went to the telephone
and made a long distance call.

847
01:03:59,527 --> 01:04:02,087
He had his wife's jewellery
in the handbag.

848
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:05,045
Seemed worried about it.
Asked someone's advice over the phone.

849
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:06,720
Someone not his wife.

850
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:08,559
Well, I never saw him
ask her for advice.

851
01:04:08,727 --> 01:04:12,117
She volunteered plenty,
but I never saw him ask her for any.

852
01:04:22,207 --> 01:04:25,483
- I wonder where he's going.
- I don't know.

853
01:04:25,887 --> 01:04:31,041
- Suppose he doesn't come back?
- He'll be back. His things are there.

854
01:04:31,207 --> 01:04:34,165
- I guess it's safe to put on lights.
- No, not yet!

855
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:46,361
OK, you can turn it on now. He must
have gone someplace to the right.

856
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:49,724
All day long, I've been trying
to keep my mind on my work.

01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:53,960
- (Lisa) Thinking about Thorwald?
- And you, and your friend, Doyle.

858
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:57,119
- Did you hear from him since he left?
- (Jeff) Not a word.

859
01:04:57,287 --> 01:04:59,562
He said he was gonna check
the railroad station and the trunk.

860
01:04:59,727 --> 01:05:01,365
He must be still at it.

861
01:05:02,287 --> 01:05:04,482
Something on your mind?

862
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:07,957
- It doesn't make sense to me.
- What doesn't?

863
01:05:08,127 --> 01:05:10,721
Women aren't that unpredictable.

864
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:14,800
Hmm. Well, I can't guess
what you're thinking.

865
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:17,356
A woman has a favourite handbag,

866
01:05:17,527 --> 01:05:21,406
and it always hangs on her bedpost
where she can get at it easily.

867
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:25,162
Then, all of a sudden, she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind. Why?

868
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:26,965
Because she didn't know
she was going on a trip,

869
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:28,958
and where she's going,
she wouldn't need the handbag.

870
01:05:29,127 --> 01:05:32,881
Yes, but only her husband
would know that.

871
01:05:33,047 --> 01:05:35,880
And that jewellery - Women don't
keep their jewellery in a purse

872
01:05:36,047 --> 01:05:38,356
getting all twisted
and scratched and tangled up.

873
01:05:38,527 --> 01:05:40,040
Well, do they hide it
in their husband's clothes?

874
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:44,041
They do not.
And they don't leave it behind either.

875
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:46,763
Why, a woman going anywhere
but the hospital

876
01:05:46,927 --> 01:05:51,000
would always take make-up,
perfume and jewellery.

877
01:05:51,167 --> 01:05:52,919
Put that over there.
That's inside stuff, huh?

878
01:05:53,087 --> 01:05:54,440
It's basic equipment.

879
01:05:54,607 --> 01:05:57,485
And you don't leave it behind in
your husband's drawer

880
01:05:57,647 --> 01:05:58,966
in your favourite handbag.

881
01:05:59,127 --> 01:06:01,277
Well, I'm with you, sweetie.
I'm with you.

882
01:06:01,447 --> 01:06:03,199
Tom Doyle has a pat answer
for that though.

883
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:05,756
That Mrs Thorwald left at 6:00am
yesterday with her husband?

884
01:06:05,927 --> 01:06:06,916
According to those witnesses.

885
01:06:08,127 --> 01:06:10,197
Well, I have a pat rebuttal
for Mr Doyle.

886
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:13,564
Couldrt have been Mrs Thorwald,
or I don't know women.

887
01:06:13,927 --> 01:06:18,523
- What about the witnesses?
- We'll agree they saw a woman,

888
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:21,155
but she was not Mrs Thorwald.

889
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:24,603
- That is, not yet.
- Is that so?

890
01:06:28,607 --> 01:06:30,279
Come here.

891
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:36,199
I'd like to see your friend's face
when we tell him.

892
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,437
He doesn't sound
like much of a detective.

893
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:43,283
Oh, don't be too hard on him.
He's a steady worker.

894
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:45,085
I sure wish he'd show up.

895
01:06:45,247 --> 01:06:48,125
Don't rush him. We have all night.

896
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:52,797
- We have all what?
- Night.

897
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,356
I'm going to stay with you.

898
01:06:56,727 --> 01:07:00,640
Well, you'll have to clear that
with my landlord.

899
01:07:00,807 --> 01:07:03,321
I have the whole weekend off.

900
01:07:03,927 --> 01:07:06,885
That's very nice,
but I just have one bed.

901
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:11,605
If you say anything else, I'll...
stay tomorrow night too.

902
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:15,885
I won't be able
to give you any... pyjamas.

903
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:23,880
You said I'll have
to live out of one suitcase.

904
01:07:25,047 --> 01:07:28,801
- I'll bet yours isn't this small.
- This is a suitcase?

905
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:31,720
Well, a Mark Cross overnight case.

906
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:35,038
- Ooh.
- Compact, but, uh... ample enough.

907
01:07:35,207 --> 01:07:37,277
Looks like you packed in a hurry.

908
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:40,519
Look at this. Isn't that amazing?

909
01:07:40,687 --> 01:07:45,158
I'll trade you... my feminine intuition
for a bed for the night.

910
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,761
I'll go along with that.

There's that song again.

913
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:12,476
Where does a man get inspiration
to write a song like that?

914
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:16,481
Well, he gets it from
the landlady once a month.

915
01:08:18,367 --> 01:08:21,040
It's utterly beautiful.

916
01:08:21,207 --> 01:08:24,722
- I wish I could be creative.
- Oh, sweetie, you are.

917
01:08:24,887 --> 01:08:28,562
Y-Y-You have a great talent for
creating difficult situations.

918
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:30,319
- I do?
- Sure.

919
01:08:30,487 --> 01:08:32,284
Like staying here all night uninvited.

920
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:35,564
Well, surprise is the most
important element of attack.

921
01:08:35,727 --> 01:08:38,764
Besides, you're not up on
your private eye literature.

922
01:08:38,927 --> 01:08:40,804
When they're in trouble,
it's always their Girl Friday

923
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:42,195
that gets them out of it.

924
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,358
Is she the girl that
saves them from the clutches

925
01:08:44,527 --> 01:08:48,076
of the over-passionate
daughters of the rich?

926
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:51,000
- The same.
- That's the one, huh?

927
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,965
It's funny. He never ends
up marrying her, does he?

01:11:16,047 --> 01:11:18,277
Jeff, aren't you going to tell him
about the jewellery?

958
01:11:18,447 --> 01:11:19,436
Jewellery?

959
01:11:19,607 --> 01:11:22,838
He's got his wife's jewellery hidden
in his clothes in the bedroom there.

960
01:11:23,007 --> 01:11:25,999
- You sure it belonged to his wife?
- It was in her favourite handbag.

961
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,727
Mr Doyle, that can only lead
to one conclusion.

962
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:29,876
Namely?

963
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:33,437
That it was not Mrs Thorwald that
left with him yesterday morning.

964
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:35,046
You figured that out, eh?

965
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:37,556
It's simply that women
don't leave their jewellery behind

966

when they go on a trip.

967

Come on, Tom. You don't really need
any of this information, do you?

968
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:52,687
As a matter of fact, I don't.

969
01:11:57,887 --> 01:12:01,846
Lars Thorwald is no more
a murderer than I am.

- No, and neither can you.

That's a secret, private world
you're looking into out there.

973
01:12:13,607 --> 01:12:15,916
People do a lot of things in private
they couldn't do in public.

974
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:18,119
Like disposing of their wives?

975
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:21,086
Get that idea out of your mind.
It'll only lead in the wrong direction.

976
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,919
What about the knife and the saw?

977
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:27,646
- Did you ever own a saw?
- Well, at home in the garage I had -

978
01:12:27,807 --> 01:12:29,763
(Doyle) How many people
did you cut up with it?

979
01:12:30,047 --> 01:12:34,882
Or with the couple hundred knives
you've owned in your lifetime?

980
01:12:35,047 --> 01:12:36,480
Your logic is backward.

981
01:12:36,647 --> 01:12:40,162
You can't ignore the disappearance
and the trunk and the jewellery.

982
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:43,046
I checked the railroad station.
He bought a ticket.

983
01:12:43,207 --> 01:12:44,959
Ten minutes later,
he put his wife on the train.

984
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:48,204
Destination: Merritsville.
The witnesses are that deep.

985
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:51,200
That might have been a woman, but
it couldn't have been Mrs Thorwald.

986
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,686
- That jewellery -
- Look, Miss Fremont.

987
01:12:52,847 --> 01:12:55,486
That feminine intuition stuff
sells magazines

988

991
01:13:02,887 --> 01:13:05,276
(Jeff) Alright!
I take it you didn't find the trunk.

992
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:08,484
All this is from an old speech
you made at the policemers ball.

993
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:11,081
I found the trunk
a half-hour after I left here.

994
01:13:11,247 --> 01:13:15,081
I suppose it's normal for a man
to tie up a trunk with heavy rope?

995
01:13:15,247 --> 01:13:16,680
If the lock is broken, yes.

996
01:13:16,847 --> 01:13:19,964
What did you find inside the trunk,
a surly note to me?

997
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,038
Mrs Thorwald's clothes;

998
01:13:22,207 --> 01:13:25,279
clean, well-packed,
not stylish, but presentable.

999
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,119
Didrt you take them off
to the crime lab?

1000
01:13:27,287 --> 01:13:30,006
I sent them on their merry
and legal way.

1001
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:32,727
Why, when a woman is taking
a simple, short trip,

1002
01:13:32,887 --> 01:13:34,718
does she take everything she owns?

1003
01:13:34,887 --> 01:13:39,005
Let's let the female psychology
department handle that one.

1004
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:41,476
I would say it looked as if
she wasrt coming back.

1005
01:13:41,647 --> 01:13:43,365
That's what's
known as a family problem.

1006
01:13:43,527 --> 01:13:45,961
If she wasrt coming back,
why didn't he tell his landlord?

1007
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:47,879
I'll tell you why
he didn't tell his landlord,

1008
01:13:48,047 --> 01:13:49,196
because he was hiding something.

1009
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,444
Do you tell your landlord everything?

1010
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:56,797
Ah, I told you to be careful, Tom.

1011
01:13:56,967 --> 01:14:00,004
If I'd have been careful
piloting that reconnaissance plane

1012
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:01,395
you wouldn't have had the chance
to take the pictures

- (Woman) It's the dog.

1080
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:39,835
Something's happened to the dog.

1081
01:19:43,287 --> 01:19:45,243
(Man) Somebody fall out a window?

1082
01:19:46,367 --> 01:19:47,959
I think it's a dog.

1083
01:19:48,727 --> 01:19:52,959
It's dead. It's been strangled.
Its neck is broken.

1084
01:19:54,607 --> 01:19:56,279
(Crying Loudly)
Which one of you did it?

1085
01:19:56,447 --> 01:19:58,278
Which one of you killed my dog?

1086
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:02,636
You don't know the meaning
of the word 'neighbours'.

1087
01:20:03,367 --> 01:20:04,720
Neighbours like each other,

1088
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:09,041
speak to each other,
care if anybody lives or dies!

1089
01:20:09,807 --> 01:20:11,684
But none of you do!

1090
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:17,922
But I couldn't imagine
any of you being so low

1091
01:20:18,087 --> 01:20:20,965
that you'd kill a helpless, friendly dog.

1092
01:20:23,247 --> 01:20:27,798
The only thing in this whole
neighbourhood who liked anybody!

1093
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:32,321
(Sobbing)

1094
01:20:34,847 --> 01:20:39,398
Did you kill him because he liked you?
Just because he liked you?

1095
01:20:42,647 --> 01:20:44,842
Let's go inside.

1096
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:49,998
- Come on. Let's go back in.
- It's only a dog.

1097
01:21:01,207 --> 01:21:02,276
(Sighs)

1098
01:21:02,447 --> 01:21:04,403
You know, for a minute,
that Tom Doyle almost had me

1099
01:21:04,567 --> 01:21:06,364
convinced I was wrong.

1100
01:21:06,447 --> 01:21:08,119
- But you're not?
- Look.

1101
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:13,042
In the courtyard, only one person
didn't come to the window. Look.

1102
01:21:18,887 --> 01:21:22,641
Why would Thorwald
want to kill a little dog?

1103
01:21:23,927 --> 01:21:26,043
Because it knew too much?

1104
01:21:33,607 --> 01:21:35,438
You think this is won'th
waiting all day to see?

1105
01:21:36,967 --> 01:21:38,161
(Lisa) Is he cleaning house?

1106
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:40,602
He's washing down the bathroom walls.

1107
01:21:41,247 --> 01:21:43,966
Hm, must have splattered a lot.

1108
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:47,956
Well, why not?
That's what we're all thinking.

1109
01:21:48,127 --> 01:21:51,085
He killed her in there,
he has to clean up those stains.

1110
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:53,397
Oh, Stella, your choice of words.

1111
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:58,038
(Stella) Nobody ever invented
a polite word for a killing yet.

1112
01:21:59,847 --> 01:22:04,557
Lisa, back there on that shelf,
there's a little yellow box, you see it?

1113
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:06,558
- Top one?
- Right on top, yeah.

1114
01:22:06,727 --> 01:22:08,877
And bring me the viewer there.

1115
01:22:10,847 --> 01:22:14,635
I just got a...
These are about two weeks old.

1116
01:22:15,887 --> 01:22:19,197
I hope I took something else
besides leg art. Now which one...

1117
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,562
What are you looking for?

1118
01:22:22,127 --> 01:22:25,039
There's something, and if I'm right,
I think I've solved a murder.

1119
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,198
- Mrs Thorwald?
- No.

1120
01:22:28,127 --> 01:22:29,924
No, the dog.

1121
01:22:31,367 --> 01:22:35,565
Uh-huh. I think I know
why Thorwald killed that dog.

1122
01:22:35,727 --> 01:22:38,446
Here, now you take a look.
Tell me what you see.

1123
01:22:39,047 --> 01:22:40,799
Now take it down.

1124
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:42,685
Now look again.

1125
01:22:42,847 --> 01:22:44,644
Now take it down. You see?

1126
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:48,076
It's just a picture of the backyard -

1127
01:22:48,247 --> 01:22:52,559
But with one important change.
One important change.

1128
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:56,561
Those flowers
in Thorwald's pet flower bed.

1129
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,797
You mean where the dog
was sniffing around?

1130
01:22:58,967 --> 01:23:02,277
Where the dog was digging.
Now look at those flowers.

1131
01:23:02,447 --> 01:23:06,326
Look, those two yellow zinnias
on this end

1132
01:23:06,487 --> 01:23:07,966
aren't as tall as they were.

1133
01:23:08,127 --> 01:23:10,880
Since when do flowers
grow shorter in two weeks?

1134
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:14,837
- There's something buried there.
- Mrs Thorwald.

1135
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:18,079
You haven't spent much time
around cemeteries, have you?

1136
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:20,966
Mr Thorwald could scarcely
put his wife's body

1137
01:23:21,127 --> 01:23:24,119
in a plot of ground
about one foot square.

1138
01:23:24,287 --> 01:23:26,801
Unless, of course,
he put her in standing on end,

1139
01:23:26,967 --> 01:23:29,481
and then he wouldn't need
a knife and saw.

1140
01:23:29,647 --> 01:23:33,083
No, my idea is she's
scattered all over town.

1141
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:35,556
- Leg in the East River -
- Oh, Stella, please!

1142
01:23:35,727 --> 01:23:37,206
No, no, no. There's something in there.

1143
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:39,403
Those flowers have been
taken out and put back in.

1144
01:23:39,567 --> 01:23:41,239
- Maybe it's the knife and saw.
- Yeah -

1145
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:43,557
- Call Lieutenant Doyle.
- No, let's wait.

1146
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:47,117
Let's wait till it gets a little darker,
and I'll go over there and dig them up.

1147
01:23:47,287 --> 01:23:51,758
You'll go? You won't dig anything up
and get your neck broken.

1148
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:53,804
No, no, we've...

1149
01:23:53,967 --> 01:23:57,004
We're not gonna call Doyle until
I can produce Mrs Thorwald's body.

1150
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:59,806
What we've got to do is find a way
to get into that apartment.

1151
01:23:59,967 --> 01:24:01,286
(Softly) He's packing.

1152
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,322
(Jeff) Uh-oh.

1153
01:24:03,727 --> 01:24:06,082
Here, get me a pencil.

1154
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:09,924
Stella, get me some note paper.
It's up here someplace.

1155
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,406
There it is.

1156
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,642
(Jeff) You did it, Thorwald. You did it.

1157
01:25:31,487 --> 01:25:33,125
- Look out, Lisa. He's coming.
- You never should have let her do it.

1158
01:25:33,287 --> 01:25:34,879
- If he ever -
- Look. Look. Look.

1159
01:25:53,447 --> 01:25:56,280
(Sighs) Thank heaven that's over.

1160
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:02,717
- Alright if I have a drink?
- Sure, go ahead.

1161
01:26:11,447 --> 01:26:14,962
There's no doubt about it. He's leaving.
It's just a question of when.

1162
01:26:15,127 --> 01:26:18,642
Mind if I use that portable keyhole?

1163
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:22,163
Go ahead, just as long as you tell me
what you're looking at.

1164
01:26:28,447 --> 01:26:30,563
- (Stella) I wonder...
- (Jeff) Wonder what?

1165
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,922
Miss Lonelyhearts just laid out
something that looks like

1166
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,964
rhodium tri-eckonal capsules.

1167
01:26:35,127 --> 01:26:37,880
- (Jeff) You can tell from here?
- (Stella) I've handled enough of those

1168
01:26:38,047 --> 01:26:40,277
to put everybody in Hackensack
to sleep for the winter.

1169
01:26:40,727 --> 01:26:44,117
- Does she have enough of them to -
- To make her rest easier -

1170
01:26:44,287 --> 01:26:46,198
- (Door opens)
- Wasrt that close?

1171
01:26:47,007 --> 01:26:49,601
What was his reaction
when he looked at the note?

1172
01:26:50,207 --> 01:26:52,163
(Stella) It wasrt the kind
of expression that would get him

1173
01:26:52,327 --> 01:26:53,806
a quick loan at the bank.

1174
01:26:53,967 --> 01:26:56,686
(Softly) Jeff, the handbag!

1175
01:27:20,247 --> 01:27:22,363
Suppose Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring

1176
01:27:22,527 --> 01:27:25,121
is among the jewellery
he has in that handbag?

1177
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:27,881
Now, during the phone conversation
he held up three rings:

1178
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:31,039
one with a diamond,
one with a big stone of some sort,

1179
01:27:31,207 --> 01:27:33,198
and then just a plain gold band.

1180
01:27:33,367 --> 01:27:37,042
The last thing she would leave behind
would be her wedding ring.

1181
01:27:37,207 --> 01:27:39,277
Stella,
do you ever leave yours at home?

1182
01:27:39,447 --> 01:27:44,441
The only way anybody could get that
ring would be to chop off my finger.

1183
01:27:46,407 --> 01:27:49,365
Let's go down and find out
what's buried in the garden.

1184
01:27:49,527 --> 01:27:53,884
Why not? I've always wanted
to meet Mrs Thorwald.

1185
01:27:54,047 --> 01:27:55,560
- What are you two talking about -
- You got a shovel?

1186
01:27:55,727 --> 01:27:56,876
Of course I don't have a shovel.

1187
01:27:57,047 --> 01:28:00,562
- There's probably one in the basement.
- If you're squeamish, just don't look.

1188
01:28:00,727 --> 01:28:01,716
Squeamish? I'm not squeamish.

1189
01:28:01,887 --> 01:28:05,323
I just don't want you two
to end up like that dog.

1190
01:28:05,487 --> 01:28:08,638
Oh, you know, Miss Fremont,
he might just have something there.

1191
01:28:08,807 --> 01:28:10,479
Just hold on. Here, take this.

1192
01:28:10,647 --> 01:28:12,922
No sense taking any chances
in this thing.

1193
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,521
Here, give me the phone book.

1194
01:28:16,287 --> 01:28:18,039
What for?

1195
01:28:18,207 --> 01:28:20,038
Maybe I can
get him out of that apartment.

1196
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:21,560
We only need a few minutes.

1197
01:28:21,727 --> 01:28:23,479
I'll see if I can get about 15 minutes.

1198
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:25,922
- How?
- (Softly) Thorwald.

1199
01:28:27,047 --> 01:28:29,163
Thorwald... Thorwald.

1200
01:28:31,247 --> 01:28:34,398
Chelsea 2-7099.

1201
01:28:35,487 --> 01:28:36,522
2-7099.

1202
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:40,282
We scared him once,
maybe we can scare him again.

1203
01:28:40,447 --> 01:28:43,200
I guess I'm using that word
'we' a little freely.

1204
01:28:43,367 --> 01:28:44,800
You're taking all the chances.

1205
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:48,485
- (Lisa) Shall we vote him in, Stella?
- (Stella) Unanimously.

1206
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:51,480
(Softly) 2-7099. Look out.

1207
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:55,798
(Softly) Chelsea.

1208
01:28:57,047 --> 01:28:58,799
Chelsea.

1209
01:28:59,647 --> 01:29:02,400
(Repeating Number)

1210
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:05,880
(Telephone Ringing)

1211
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:17,126
Go on, pick it up, Thorwald.

1212
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,155
Go on, you're curious.

1213
01:29:21,327 --> 01:29:24,000
You wonder if it's your girlfriend
calling, the one you killed for.

1214
01:29:24,487 --> 01:29:26,796
Go on, pick it up.

1215
01:29:30,007 --> 01:29:33,761
- (Thorwald) "Hello?"
- Did you get my note?

1216
01:29:35,887 --> 01:29:37,718
Well, did you get it, Thorwald?

1217
01:29:37,887 --> 01:29:39,206
(Thorwald) "Who are you?"

1218
01:29:39,367 --> 01:29:41,198
(Jeff) I'll give you a chance to find out.

1219
01:29:41,367 --> 01:29:43,756
(Jeff) Meet me
in the bar at the Albert Hotel.

1220
01:29:43,927 --> 01:29:45,883
Do it right away.

1221
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:49,084
- (Thorwald) "Why should I?"
- A little business meeting...

1222
01:29:49,247 --> 01:29:52,159
to settle the estate of your late wife.

1223
01:29:52,927 --> 01:29:55,964
(Thorwald)
"I... don't know what you mean."

1224
01:29:56,127 --> 01:29:57,958
Come on. Quit stalling, Thorwald,

1225
01:29:58,127 --> 01:30:00,243
or I'll hang up and call the police.

1226
01:30:00,407 --> 01:30:04,082
- (Thorwald) "I only have $100."
- That's a start.

1227
01:30:04,647 --> 01:30:08,356
I'm at the Albert now.
I'll be looking for you.

(Closes Door)

1229
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,166
Come on, Stella, let's go.

1230
01:30:28,327 --> 01:30:29,806
(Softly) One of you
keep an eye on this window.

1231
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:33,482
If I see him coming back,
I'll signal with a flashbulb.

1232
01:31:41,127 --> 01:31:43,595
(Traffic Noises)

1233
01:32:04,007 --> 01:32:05,486
(Woman) "This is the Doyle residence."

1234
01:32:05,647 --> 01:32:09,799
Hello, this is L B Jefferies.
I'm a friend of Mr Doyle.

1235
01:32:09,967 --> 01:32:12,117
- Who's this?
- "This is a baby-sitter."

1236
01:32:12,287 --> 01:32:14,960
Oh, uh... when do you expect them in?

1237
01:32:15,127 --> 01:32:19,359
"They went to dinner and
maybe a nightclub."

1238
01:32:19,527 --> 01:32:21,199
I see, hm.

1239
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:24,279
If he calls in, have him get
in touch with L B Jefferies?

1240
01:32:24,967 --> 01:32:26,798
I might have quite a surprise for him.

1241
01:32:26,967 --> 01:32:29,765
"Well, do we have
your number, Mr Jefferies?"

1242
01:32:29,927 --> 01:32:33,761
- He has it. Good night.
- "Good night."

# (Band Practising)

1244
01:32:49,247 --> 01:32:53,206
(Jeff) Ah, Stella was wrong
about Miss Lonelyhearts.

1245
01:33:23,727 --> 01:33:26,560
(Softly) Lisa, what are you... Don't...

1246
01:33:31,287 --> 01:33:32,766
Don't...

1247
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:42,920
(Softly)
Lisa, what are you doing? Don't go...

1248
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:00,275
Li...

1249
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:19,963
(Softly) Come on, come on!
Get out of there!

1250
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:28,916
She said ring Thorwald's phone
the second you see him come back.

1251
01:34:29,087 --> 01:34:31,123
(Jeff) We'll ring right now!
(Stella) Give her another minute.

1252
01:34:35,607 --> 01:34:38,121
(Composer) Alright, fellows,
let's try it once from the beginning.

1253
01:34:38,287 --> 01:34:39,720
(Stella) Miss Lonelyhearts.

1254
01:34:39,887 --> 01:34:41,400
Oh, call the police!

1255
01:34:41,567 --> 01:34:44,035
(Jeff Dialling)

1256
01:34:44,767 --> 01:34:47,122
- "Operator."
- Get me the police, sixth precinct.

1257
01:34:47,287 --> 01:34:48,766
(Operator) "Yes, sir."

1258
01:35:00,247 --> 01:35:03,239
(Stella)
Mr Jefferies, the music stopped her.

1259
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:11,803
What... Lisa!

1260
01:35:13,487 --> 01:35:14,602
Lisa!

1261
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:27,479
"Precinct Six, Sergeant Allgood."

1262
01:35:27,647 --> 01:35:32,277
Hello. Look, a man is assaulting
a woman at 125 West Ninth Street,

1263
01:35:32,447 --> 01:35:34,517
second floor, at the rear.

1264
01:35:35,047 --> 01:35:36,366
Make it fast!

1265
01:35:36,527 --> 01:35:38,563
- (Allgood) "Your name?"
- (Stammering) L B Jefferies.

1266
01:35:38,727 --> 01:35:41,560
- (Allgood) "Phone number?"
- (Jeff) Chelsea 2-5598

1267
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:42,716
(Allgood) "Two minutes."

1268
01:36:01,807 --> 01:36:03,126
(Lisa) The door was open.

(Lisa Continues, Indistinct)

1270
01:36:17,527 --> 01:36:18,846
Oh...

1271
01:36:24,447 --> 01:36:27,439
- (Lisa) I told you...
- (Softly) Oh, no!

1272
01:36:28,207 --> 01:36:30,084
Let go of me! Jeff!

1273
01:36:30,247 --> 01:36:33,159
- Oh, no! (Gasps)
- (Lisa) Jeff! Jeff!

1274
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:34,840
Jeff!

1275
01:36:35,887 --> 01:36:37,957
Lisa!

1276
01:36:38,127 --> 01:36:39,355
Stella, what do we do?

1277
01:36:40,567 --> 01:36:44,116
- (Lisa) Jeff! Jeff!
- Here they come.

1278
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:50,758
(Ringing Doorbell)

1279
01:37:21,527 --> 01:37:23,358
(Talking, Indistinct)

1280
01:37:32,647 --> 01:37:34,558
(Stella) What's she trying to do?
Why doesn't she turn him in?

1281
01:37:34,727 --> 01:37:37,878
- She's a smart girl.
- "Smart girl?" She'll be arrested.

1282
01:37:38,047 --> 01:37:40,925
(Jeff)
lt'll get her out of there, won't it?

1283
01:37:42,807 --> 01:37:45,241
(Jeff) Look, the wedding ring!

1284
01:37:50,247 --> 01:37:53,125
(Softly) Turn off the light! He's seen us!

1285
01:38:02,367 --> 01:38:03,641
How long do you think he'll stay there?

1286
01:38:03,807 --> 01:38:07,720
Unless he's dumber than I think,
he won't wait until his lease is up.

1287
01:38:07,887 --> 01:38:09,878
Get my billfold out of the drawer
in the table there.

1288
01:38:10,047 --> 01:38:12,641
- What do you need money for?
- I'm gonna bail Lisa out of jail.

1289
01:38:12,807 --> 01:38:14,877
You could leave her there
till next Tuesday.

1290
01:38:15,047 --> 01:38:17,356
Then you could sneak
safely away as planned.

1291
01:38:17,527 --> 01:38:22,237
- Yeah, let's see, $127.
- How much do you need?

1292
01:38:22,407 --> 01:38:25,797
Well, this is first offence burglary,
that's about $250.

1293
01:38:25,967 --> 01:38:28,800
- Lisa's handbag.
- Yeah.

1294
01:38:28,967 --> 01:38:31,083
- How much does she have?
- Fifty cents.

1295
01:38:31,247 --> 01:38:34,762
- Here, take this.
- (Stella) I got $20 or so in my purse.

1296
01:38:34,927 --> 01:38:35,916
(Jeff) What about the rest?

1297
01:38:36,087 --> 01:38:38,442
When those cops see Lisa,
they'll even contribute.

1298
01:38:38,967 --> 01:38:41,162
(Telephone Ringing)

1299
01:38:43,847 --> 01:38:46,520
(Softly) Just a minute. Hurry up!

1300
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:49,406
- Jefferies.
- (Doyle) "What is it now?"

1301
01:38:49,567 --> 01:38:52,365
Doyle, I've got something
really big for you.

1302
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:54,358
"Why did I have to return your call?"

1303
01:38:54,527 --> 01:38:57,439
"Look! Don't louse up my night
with another mad killer -"

1304
01:38:57,607 --> 01:39:02,158
Listen to me! Listen to me!
Lisa's in jail. She got arrested.

1305
01:39:02,327 --> 01:39:04,045
- "Your Lisa?"
- My Lisa.

1306
01:39:04,207 --> 01:39:07,722
Boy, you should have seen her.
She got into Thorwald's apartment,

1307
01:39:07,887 --> 01:39:09,798
but then he came back
and the only way I could get her out,

1308
01:39:09,967 --> 01:39:10,956
was call the police.

1309
01:39:11,127 --> 01:39:12,196
- "I told you -"
- I know you told me.

1310
01:39:12,367 --> 01:39:15,359
She went in to get evidence,
and she came out with evidence.

1311
01:39:15,527 --> 01:39:19,964
- "Like what?"
- Like Mrs Thorwald's wedding ring.

1312
01:39:20,127 --> 01:39:24,120
If that woman was alive,
she'd be wearing that ring, right?

1313
01:39:24,287 --> 01:39:26,801
- "Hm. It's a possibility."
- A 'possibility'? It's a fact.

1314
01:39:26,967 --> 01:39:28,559
He killed a dog last night

1315
01:39:28,727 --> 01:39:31,480
because the dog was scratching around
in the garden. You know why?

1316
01:39:31,647 --> 01:39:34,878
Because he had something buried
in that garden that the dog scented.

1317
01:39:35,047 --> 01:39:36,036
"Like an old ham bone?"

1318
01:39:36,207 --> 01:39:39,040
I don't know what pet names
Thorwald had for his wife,

1319
01:39:39,207 --> 01:39:40,322
but I'll tell you this:

1320
01:39:40,487 --> 01:39:43,718
All those trips at night
with that metal suitcase,

1321
01:39:43,887 --> 01:39:45,115
he wasrt taking out his possessions,

1322
01:39:45,287 --> 01:39:48,199
because his possessions
are still up in the apartment.

1323
01:39:48,367 --> 01:39:50,437
"Do you think perhaps
it was old 'ham bone? '"

1324
01:39:50,607 --> 01:39:53,405
And I'll tell you something else.

1325
01:39:53,567 --> 01:39:56,400
All the telephone calls
he made were long distance, alright?

1326
01:39:56,567 --> 01:39:59,877
Now, if he called his wife long
distance on the day she left,

1327
01:40:00,047 --> 01:40:02,163
after she arrived in Merritsville,

1328
01:40:02,327 --> 01:40:05,399
why did she write a card to him
saying she arrived in Merritsville?

1329
01:40:05,567 --> 01:40:07,285
Why did she do that?

1330
01:40:08,047 --> 01:40:10,277
- "Where'd they take Lisa?"
- Precinct six.

1331
01:40:10,447 --> 01:40:11,846
I sent somebody over
with the bail money.

1332
01:40:12,007 --> 01:40:13,918
"Maybe you won't need it.
I'll run it down, Jeff."

1333
01:40:14,087 --> 01:40:17,716
Alright. Hurry up, will you?
This fellow knows he's being watched.

1334
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,718
He's not gonna wait around forever.
Hurry up.

1335
01:40:19,887 --> 01:40:22,560
"If that ring checks out,
we'll give him an escort. So long, Jeff."

1336
01:40:22,727 --> 01:40:25,116
- So long.
- (Hangs Up Receiver)

1337

Hello, Tom.

1338
01:40:33,007 --> 01:40:35,726

I don't have any money.

Say something.

- No.
- (Thorwald) Tell her to bring it back.

I can't. The police have it by now.

01:45:29,847 --> 01:45:34,204
Thorwald's ready to take us
on a tour of the East River.

1379
01:45:38,247 --> 01:45:39,839
Did he say what was buried
in the flower bed?

1380
01:45:40,447 --> 01:45:44,963
Yeah. He said the dog got
too inquisitive, so he dug it up.

1381
01:45:45,127 --> 01:45:47,641
It's in a hat box over in his apartment.

1382
01:45:47,807 --> 01:45:48,956
- Want to look?
- (Stella) No, thanks.

1383
01:45:49,127 --> 01:45:51,402
I don't want any part of her.

1384
01:45:57,647 --> 01:46:00,036
I hope it's gonna be a hit.
This is the first release.

1385
01:46:00,207 --> 01:46:02,118
I'd love to hear it.

1386
01:46:02,287 --> 01:46:05,962
I can't tell you what
this music has meant to me.

1387
01:46:06,127 --> 01:46:08,960
# Record Playing

1388
01:46:15,727 --> 01:46:18,241
Oh, sweet little puppy.

1389
01:46:18,807 --> 01:46:22,083
Don't jump. Let's try it again, puppy.

1390
01:46:22,247 --> 01:46:24,920
Stay still. Stay.

1391
01:46:31,647 --> 01:46:33,717
- Stanley!
- Hello, baby.

1392
01:46:36,247 --> 01:46:39,045
My, look what
the army's done for you!

1393
01:46:40,887 --> 01:46:42,605
The army's made me hungry.

1394
01:46:42,767 --> 01:46:44,997
What have you got
in the icebox to eat?

1395
01:46:45,167 --> 01:46:46,646
Boy, it's good to be home.

1396
01:46:46,807 --> 01:46:48,684
(Bird Chirping)

1397
01:46:48,847 --> 01:46:50,405
(Snoring)

1398
01:46:50,567 --> 01:46:53,127
If you had told me you'd quit your job,

1399
01:46:53,367 --> 01:46:54,766
we wouldn't have gotten married.

1400
01:46:54,927 --> 01:46:56,485
Oh, honey. Come on.

1401
01:47:09,247 --> 01:47:11,442
# But dream

1402
01:47:11,607 --> 01:47:14,041
# Forever

1403
01:47:16,207 --> 01:47:18,243
# In your arms

1404
01:47:18,407 --> 01:47:20,841
# Oh, Lisa

1405
01:47:25,087 --> 01:47:29,797
# Lisa #
