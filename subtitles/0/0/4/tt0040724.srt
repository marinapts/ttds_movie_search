he's leaving the train.

- I am.

You can't do that.
You signed on.

- I signed nothing. If I had, I'd stay.

after you left St. Louis.

The beginning of herds.

But I'm starting my own herd.

I watched the land south of here
since we left the Salt Fork.

16
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:49,598
It's good land. Good grass for beef.
I'm going south where it is.

You're too good a gun for me to let you
leave the train now.

I'd ponder on letting him be.

made up. Even you can't change it.

stomp on you on the way out.

I don't, do I?

You'll need me.
You'll need a woman.

You need what a woman can give you
to do what you have to do.

00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,642
- Where is he?
- At his home across the river.

159
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:26,680
Six hundred kilometers south.

160
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:29,545
- How far is that?
- About 400 miles.

161
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:32,142
That's too much land for one man.
Why, it ain't decent.

162
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,881
Here's all this land aching
to be used and never has been.

163
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:39,654
It is for Don Diego to do as he chooses.
This land is Don Diego's.

164
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,695
What is that river
you were talking about?

165
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,127
The Rio Grande--

166
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:47,065
Tell Don Diego all the land
north of that river is mine.

167
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:49,068
Tell him to stay off of it.

168
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,798
- But the land is his.
- Where did he get it?

169
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:56,172
Many years ago by grant and patent,
inscribed by the king of all Spain.

170
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:58,837
You mean he took it away
from whoever was here before.

171
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,847
- Indians maybe.
- Maybe so.

172
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,542
I'm taking it away from him.

173
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:07,078
Others have thought as you.
Others have tried.

174
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,554
And you've always been
good enough to stop them?

175
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:11,386
It is my work.

176
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,386
Pretty unhealthy job.

177
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:17,029
Get away, Matt.

178
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm sorry for you--

179
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:27,966
How about you?
You want some of it?

180
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,773
It is not my land. I will wait
until Don Diego tells me what to do.

181
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:37,372
Go tell him what happened.
Tell him what I said.

182
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:42,113
Take your friend's horse.
We'll bury him. Move!

183
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:52,153
Matt, I told you to get away.
You might have got hurt.

184
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,289
He went for his gun first,
but you seemed to know--

185
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,129
Next time, do what I say.

186
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,295
- How'd you know he was gonna draw?
- By watching his eyes.

187
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,339
- Remember that.
- I will.

188
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:09,971
Get a shovel and my Bible.

189
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,982
I'll read over him.

190
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:21,792
"We brought nothing into this world,
and it's certain we carry nothing out.

191
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,385
The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.

192
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:26,897
Blessed be the name
of the Lord. Amen."

193
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:45,479
Turn 'em loose.

194
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,257
[ Cattle Mooing ]

195
00:18:59,998 --> 00:19:02,023
[ Matthew ]
They're going to get away.

196
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,034
[ Dunson ] Wherever they go,
they'll be on my land.

197
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:13,234
My land. We're here,
and we're going to stay here.

198
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:19,246
Give me 10 years. I'll have that brand
on the greatest ranch in Texas.

199
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:26,456
The big house will be down by the river,
and the corrals and the barns behind it.

200
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:29,153
It'll be a good place to live in.

201
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:34,494
Ten years and I'll have the Red River D
on more cattle than you've ever seen.

202
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:39,265
I'll have that brand on enough beef
to feed the whole country.

203
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,965
Good beef for hungry people.

204
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,443
Beef to make them strong,
make them grow.

205
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:49,969
It takes work, and it takes sweat.

206
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:53,882
And it takes time,
lots of time.

207
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,544
It takes years.

208
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:00,122
Well, we've had
our ten years and more.

209
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:02,494
- About 14.
- Near to 15, and we've got the cattle.

210
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,019
- About 14.
- Near to 15, and we've got the cattle.

211
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,122
Thousands of heads of good beef.

212
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,227
And there as they stand there isn't
a head worth a plug three-cent piece.

213
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:16,434
Three-cent piece? That's more silver
money than I've seen since the war.

214
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:20,274
That's right. It all happened
while you were away, Matt.

215
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,975
More cattle than a man could
gather elsewhere in two lifetimes.

216
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,282
And I'm broke.
Unless we can move them, I'm broke.

217
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,946
Figured that's why
you rounded them up.

218
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,321
I'm not going to take it haunch-backed
like the rest around here.

219
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:36,587
- If there's no cattle market in Texas--
- And there ain't.

220
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,595
Then I'll take them
where there is a market...

221
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,688
if it means driving them
a thousand miles.

222
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:42,756
- Missouri?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:44,961
That's what I figured.

224
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,130
Seems you two have been
doing a lot of figuring.

225
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,073
While you were at it, did you figure out
the best way to get them there?

226
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:55,442
Which trail to take? Yeah. San Saba,
then Meridian, then along the Brazos--

227
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:56,810
That's the long way around.

228
00:20:57,816 --> 00:20:59,613
Along the Brazos and up Palo Pinto--

229
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:02,278
- I said that's the long way.
- I know it's the long way.

230
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:04,982
But there's good water
clear all the way up to the Red.

231
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,320
But going that way,
we'd get two extra crossings.

232
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,952
- You're not going. How do you know--
- I'm not?

233
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:12,690
No, you're not.
How do you know the water's good?

234
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:16,291
- I led a patrol that way.
- You think it's worth--

235
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,893
You think it's worth--
What are you mumbling about?

236
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,938
Where are those store teeth
Matt brought you?

237
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:22,940
- In my pocket.
- Why don't you use them?

238
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:25,033
They whistle.
I use them for eating.

239
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,135
- Can't understand you.
- Everybody else can.

240
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:28,770
What did you say?

241
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:31,714
I said, there's a lot of things
you don't know about, Mr. Dunson.

242
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:34,217
- What?
- First, about me going on this drive.

243
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:35,480
Go ahead.

244
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:37,714
- It's a thousand miles to Missouri?
- That's right.

245
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:39,780
You figure me and my bad leg
couldn't ride a horse that far.

246
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:42,292
-That's it.
-It might be I could ride a chuck wagon.

247
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,622
We've already got a cook.

248
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:48,227
That is right, Mr. Dunson.

249
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,567
But might be Old Cookie might not
like grubbing the trip all that way.

250
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:56,198
You heard me good that time,
didn't you?

251
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,573
It might be the time of year when old
Cookie would like a change of scenery.

252
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:03,341
Might be I already persuaded him,
'cause he up and quit this morning!

253
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:10,178
Well, then, it might be we could
persuade you to drive the chuck wagon.

254
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:12,917
Might be, Mr. Dunson. Might be.

255
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,762
That's a pretty nice gun
you're scratching those matches on.

256
00:22:25,704 --> 00:22:29,902
- How is your gun arm?
- I've used it a lot the last few years.

257
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,169
- Get me my horse, will you, Matt?
- Yeah.

258
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:35,610
Funny thing about guns--
Draw!

259
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,006
I haven't heard that
in a lot of years.

260
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:42,485
He beat you.
You knew it was coming. He beat you.

261
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:46,183
I'd say he was just a little faster,
just a mite faster than you was.

262
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:50,023
Matt, draw up a map of that country
we were talking about--

263
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:54,156
- I did. It's on your desk.
- [ Groot Cackles ]

264
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:56,462
Mite faster
about a lot of things.

265
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:58,802
I'll see you later.

266
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,937
That's the first time in one year
I see the grin on his face...

267
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,534
except the other day
when you come home.

268
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:10,080
- Didn't you see anything else?
- Huh?

269
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:15,509
That look on his face
when he was talking about the cattle.

270
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,749
- He's afraid.
- Afraid?

271
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:21,553
- You're crazy. You're looney--
- Am I?

272
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:26,555
Sure, sure. I'm scared too.

273
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:29,031
But I've been here
watching and seeing--

274
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,160
- Seeing what?
- Seeing a man fighting.

275
00:23:32,237 --> 00:23:34,967
Fighting with his soul and gut
to hang on to this place.

276
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,270
Fourteen years of it,
and it cost him dear too.

277
00:23:38,343 --> 00:23:41,312
Cost him a woman.
The only woman he ever wanted.

278
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,438
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You know about that.

279
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,608
Cost him the killing
of them seven graves.

280
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:49,483
Men who tried to take the place
away from him, but that weren't hard.

281
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,251
He knows that kind of fighting.
What else?

282
00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:55,417
Then come the war
while you was away.

283
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:57,427
He learned a lot of things
for himself.

284
00:23:57,495 --> 00:24:00,055
He learned that a ranch
ain't only beef but it's money.

285
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:02,224
But the war took all the money
out of the South.

286
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,669
He didn't know about money. He never
had none. He didn't know what to do.

287
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,866
You mean he just doesn't know
who to fight.

288
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,273
That's all right.

289
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:16,177
He's just been waiting for you
to head the herd north in a full drive.

290
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:20,377
It's never been done before.
Ten thousand cattle clear to Missouri.

291
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:23,182
- We could make it.
- We--

292
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:28,351
I'm glad you come home, 'cause--

293
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,360
Well...

294
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,592
I'm glad you come home.

295
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,880
Let him go!

296
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,422
Hey, Matt. It's a Diego.

297
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,923
Let him go.

298
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:07,297
Another Meeker.

299
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:09,731
- Turn him loose.
- Hold it!

300
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:13,362
- Put a brand on him.
- It's a Meeker steer.

301
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:17,067
- I said brand him.
- He's wearing a Meeker iron.

302
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:19,705
I can't see it.

303
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:23,605
Brand him.

304
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:25,650
All right, but the next one up
is another Diego.

305
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,087
Brand him.

306
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,056
Put the iron
on all of them, Teeler.

307
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:41,189
Anything you see, slap it with
a Red River D and burn it deep.

308
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:42,698
Why not?

309
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:48,328
You're going to wind up branding
every rump in Texas except mine.

310
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:51,799
Hand me that iron.

311
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,739
- You don't think I'd do it, do you?
- No, I don't.

312
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:03,615
I'm going to Missouri with every steer,
cow and bull I can lay my hands on.

313
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:09,126
I think Meeker might be real pleased
to see our brand on his stock.

314
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,753
That I'll argue with Meeker.

315
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:16,892
And now might be a good time. He's
even got some people to back him up.

316
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,469
I want to see this.

317
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,980
Howdy, Dunson. Matt.

318
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,209
I hear you're making
a drive, Dunson.

319
00:26:33,284 --> 00:26:36,048
News travels fast.
Yeah, we're going to Missouri.

320
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,782
That's what I heard. I also heard
something else yesterday.

321
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:42,383
Cumberland, a neighbor of mine,
drove 3,000 head to the Red River.

322
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,394
When he got across,
the Missouri border gangs jumped him...

323
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:46,828
stole the herd, killed all his men.

324
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,831
- Hard luck.
- You know about it then?

325
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,663
I know about Cumberland and Shriver
and a lot of others...

326
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,704
but nobody's gonna take my cattle.

327
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,762
I don't want anybody
to take mine either.

328
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,831
I hear some of my brand
wandered over this way.

329
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,741
- Mind if we look your herd over?
- I do mind.

330
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,870
- You'd stop us?
- Yeah, we would.

331
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,881
Can't you hold that horse still?

332
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,846
Well?

333
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:11,479
- Shall we take that look around?
- You must be new around here.

334
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:14,524
- [ Matt ] I told you we'd stop--
- I heard you.

335
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,583
Well, Mr. Meeker?

336
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,651
Maybe I should introduce you two
before you--

337
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:22,495
- [ Matt ] Who are you?
- Some call me one thing, some another.

338
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:25,729
- What do they call you most?
- By my name, Cherry Valance.

339
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:29,295
- Of Val Verde?
- Val Verde way.

340
00:27:29,373 --> 00:27:32,001
- We've heard of you.
- Thanks.

341
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:34,544
They say you're good with a gun.
How good?

342
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:38,514
-I manage to stay alive.
-[ Matt ] You've been doing pretty good.

343
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:41,574
- Still want to stop us?
- Yeah.

344
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,654
Well, Mr. Meeker,
what do you say?

345
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:49,921
At one time, I would have said yes.
But now-- Look, Tom.

346
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:53,657
- Everything I've got--
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

347
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:58,031
We rounded up some of yours, Diego's
and everybody else's around here.

348
00:27:58,102 --> 00:27:59,296
And?

349
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,067
I haven't got the time
or inclination to cut them out.

350
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,870
I'll drive them to Missouri and give you
two dollars a head when I get back.

351
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:09,037
- And if you don't get back?
- That's your gamble.

352
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:14,210
I reckon it is. Not a bad one either.
All right, suits me.

353
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:17,379
Mr. Meeker, I changed my mind
about working with you.

354
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:18,887
Can you use another hand?

355
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:22,391
- We're full up.
- I'd like to go with you to Missouri.

356
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:25,792
- I told you--
- I heard you. I care to go along.

357
00:28:25,863 --> 00:28:28,627
Might find it harder to stay alive
along the Missouri border.

358
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:31,265
I might at that.

359
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,630
Wages are $10 a month.

360
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:37,572
Triple if the steers
bring $15 at the railroad.

361
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:39,609
- We lose the herd, you lose your wages.
- Fair enough.

362
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,804
All right, good luck.

363
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,608
Good-bye, Mr. Meeker.

364
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,175
- Take care of him, Matt.
- Sure.

365
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:53,450
I take it I'm hired.

366
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,253
You're hired.

Brand them all.
Everything that can walk.

Yes, sir!
Brand them all, boys! Get going!

369
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,492
You ought to stick around
back there.

370
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,399
- What for?
- See the shooting.

371
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:09,234
- You reckon they're going to fight?
- Not yet.

372
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:12,400
They'll just paw at each other,
find out what they're up against.

373
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:14,239
Worth seeing.

374

Could be.

00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:21,012
Let's give 'em a hand here.

376
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:24,782
Sure. That's a good-looking gun you were
about to use back there. Can I see it?

377
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:33,626
Maybe you'd like to see mine.

378
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,967
Nice. Awful nice.

379
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:44,632
There are only two things
more beautiful than a good gun.

380
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,575
A Swiss watch
or a woman from anywhere.

381
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:49,579
You ever had a good Swiss watch?

382
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,850
Go ahead. Try it.

Hey, that's very good.

Hey, hey, that's good too.
Go on. Keep it going.

385

Yeah, now I know who you'd be.

386
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:22,371
- You'd be Matthew Garth, wouldn't you?
- That's right.

387

You're as good
as they say you are.

388
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:27,210
Maybe as good as me.

389
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,445
That puts two of us
at the head of the list.

390

I'd leave room for a third.

- Dunson.

- He taught me.

- How are you doing?
- What was all that shooting?

394

That shooting was two of the best men
with a gun anybody had ever seen.

- Who?
- Matt and Cherry Valance.

- Yeah.

You know, Bunk, I always
figured Matt was better--

405
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,771
I could take that personal.

406

Yeah, and I could take the end
of your nose off just as easy.

00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:18,204
- I hear tell Cumberland--
- Cumberland didn't make it.

457
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:21,614
No one else has.
That's the reason I'm here.

458
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,949
I want you all to know
what you're up against.

459
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:27,787
You probably already know,
but I want to make sure you do.

460
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:30,019
We got a thousand miles to go.

461
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:33,256
Ten miles a day will be good.
Fifteen will be luck.

462
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,697
There will be dry country,
dry wells when we get to them.

463
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,792
There will be wind and rain.

464
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,168
There's going to be Indian territory.
How bad? I don't know.

465
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,332
When we get to Missouri,
there will be border gangs.

466
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:50,004
It's gonna be a fight all the way,
but we'll get there.

467
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,275
Nobody has to come along.

468
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:55,876
I'll still have a job for you
when we get back.

469
00:34:55,952 --> 00:35:00,150
But remember this: Every man who signs
on for this drive agrees to finish it.

470
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:05,388
There will be no quitting along the way,
not by me and not by you.

471
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:09,660
There's no hard feelings if you
don't want to go, but let me know now.

472
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:13,362
- M-Mr. Dunson, l--
- It's all right, Dan. Go ahead.

473
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:16,929
- My wife--
- You don't have to explain, Bill.

474
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:20,135
- Thanks. Good luck.
- Go on, Joe. Taylor.

475
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,007
Thank you, Mr. Dunson.

476
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,640
- It's all right, Dan. Go ahead.
- No, sir. I didn't mean that l--

477
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:28,149
- You mean what, Dan?
- l-l-l--

478
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:30,186
I just wanted to say
I want to go.

479
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,818
Fine. And the rest of you?

480
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:39,753
That means you're all
coming along. Good.

481
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:43,163
Matt here will sign you on.
We'll start at sunup.

482
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:48,232
All right, come on.
Sign your name or make your mark.

483
00:35:49,573 --> 00:35:51,837
Let me sign first, Matt.

484
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,783
- Ready, Matthew?
- All ready.

485
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,925
Take 'em to Missouri, Matt.

486
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,128
Yee-hah!

487
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:26,692
Yee-hah!

488
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,930
Yah-hah!

489
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:28,936
Yee-hoo!

490
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:30,438
- Yah-hah!
- Yee-hah!

491
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:31,974
- Yippee!
- Yah-hah!

492
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,532
- Hyah!
- Yee-hee!

493
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,134
- Hyah!
- Heee!

494
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:38,147
- Yah-hah!
- Yee-hah!

495
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,376
- Yee-hah!
- Ee-yah!

496
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,509
- Eee--
- Yah-hah!

497
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:16,507
All right, Quo!
Let's go to Missouri!

498
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,520
[ Whooping, Coughing ]

499
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:45,537
There they are, Matt.
Fourteen years of hard work.

500
00:38:47,484 --> 00:38:50,419
And they say
we can't make the drive.

501
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:52,421
They could be wrong.

502
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:54,813
Better be.

503
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:21,809
Teeler, you and Walt and Simms
are on the next watch.

504
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,820
Breakfast at 4:30, Groot.
Trail at 5:00.

505
00:39:24,888 --> 00:39:26,355
All right, Tom.

506
00:39:26,423 --> 00:39:28,755
Hey, Quo, when you're
finished there, get some--

507
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,292
What's the matter?

508
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,487
- Grub finished?
- Sure. I ate.

509
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:36,054
- Give 'em tooth.
- Teeth, I told you.

510
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:38,726
It's only a few hours till morning.
I'll be using them again.

511
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:40,736
Come morning, you get 'em.

512
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:44,763
This is getting to be plumb crazy.
We been doing this all day.

513
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,469
By the time we get to Missouri,
we'll have them all wore out...

514
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:50,775
passing them back and forth
and back and forth.

515
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:54,510
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you 100% profit.

516
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:56,518
I'll give you two dollars
for your half interest.

517
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:02,522
Not now. When I get it.
When we finish the drive.

518
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:06,358
I get money,
you get 'em tooth.

519
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:10,729
Teeth, you dumb heathen.
Why do I always have to--

520
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,734
Oh, what's the use?

521
00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:21,100
The way we worked it,
along the Brazos, the Palo Pinto...

522
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:26,171
up to the Red,
then north to Sedalia.

523
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:30,918
You make that drive to Sedalia
look very easy.

524
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:34,150
There are a lot of rough boys along
the border. I just got back from there.

525
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,852
You want to stick your nose
back in that country?

526
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:39,451
Cherry, how come
you joined the drive?

527
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:42,327
Just a notion I had.
Then Matt turned me down.

528
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:47,962
Made me want to go. Besides,
I've taken a liking to that gun of his.

529
00:40:48,037 --> 00:40:51,131
Fat chance you got
of getting that, bub.

530
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:54,870
I've been wondering. Why'd you
turn me down? You're not afraid of me.

531
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:58,209
You know what happens if this drive
doesn't get to market?

532
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,340
According to Dunson,
we lose our wages.

533
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,317
You've been all through the state.
What did you see?

534
00:41:02,385 --> 00:41:06,879
Yeah, I know. Cattle running wild.
Carpetbaggers reaching with both hands.

535
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:09,322
Ranchers roasting grain
and calling it coffee.

536
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:13,954
- I've been doing it for two months.
- I saw a man swap a steer for flour.

537
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,555
I know why you want to get through.
Maybe I do too.

538
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:19,568
But why to Missouri? Why not turn west
at the Red and head them for Kansas?

539
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:21,365
- Kansas?
- What?

540
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:24,965
Fine "howdy-ma'am" that would be
when the railroad's in Missouri.

541
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:27,066
- Railroad in Kansas too.
- Where?

542
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:29,873
I saw the one in Topeka,
and there's one in Abilene.

543
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,278
Abilene? That's further west.

544
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:34,373
Did you see it in Abilene?

545
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,716
I didn't get there.
I met a girl in Kansas City.

546
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:40,347
She fancied she could sing,
but she had other--

547
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:43,358
If we could head west at the Red--

548
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:45,394
- We'd save ourselves a heap of--
- [ Dunson ] We're going to Missouri.

549
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:51,000
I've seen buyers and cash in Sedalia.
What have you seen in Abilene?

550
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,533
Not a thing.
Just a girl told me.

551
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:55,832
- A girl with hair the color--
- Seems to me, Mr. Dunson--

552
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:58,805
- I didn't ask you, Groot.
- No, that's right.

553
00:41:58,874 --> 00:42:01,069
You didn't ask me, Mr. Dunson.

554
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:04,378
We're going to Missouri.

555
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:09,074
Suppose if I tangled with him,
I'd have to take you on too.

556
00:42:13,522 --> 00:42:17,458
You'll find him
a handful by himself.

557
00:42:40,649 --> 00:42:45,052
- How much further we going today?
- About four miles north. There's--

558
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,113
Hold that horse. There's
a good stream and bed grounds.

559
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,125
Cinch him up.

560
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,795
That old ankle's sure puffing up.

561
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,024
Yeah.

562
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,932
We're going to have
to paint it tonight.

563
00:43:06,008 --> 00:43:07,771
Keep 'em moving.

564
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,512
It's a good thing
we got a big remuda.

565
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:17,518
He's been wearing out
three, four horses a day.

566
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:20,487
- All the same, I don't like it.
- What don't you like?

567
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:24,549
Everything's going too good. We're
bound to have a hat full of trouble.

568
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:27,186
- Always yammering, I tell you.
- Well--

569
00:43:27,262 --> 00:43:30,698
I don't like to see things
go good or bad.

570
00:43:30,766 --> 00:43:33,064
I like 'em in-between.

571
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:46,648
Groot, what's Dan riding
in Quo's wagon for?

572
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:48,945
- I was wanting to discuss that myself.
- What?

573
00:43:49,017 --> 00:43:51,042
- I was wanting to discuss that--
- I can't understand you.

574
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,418
Why don't you use your teeth?

575
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:54,478
Whoa!

576
00:43:56,091 --> 00:44:00,027
My teeth is just
what we was discussing.

577
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:03,064
Well, talk on your own time.
Dan should be working.

578
00:44:03,132 --> 00:44:06,033
If you was half human, you'd give
them back to me. I could use them.

579
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,569
Besides, they'd help
keep the dust out of my mouth.

580
00:44:08,637 --> 00:44:10,571
Keep mouth shut.
Dust not get in.

581
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,040
Bet I ate 10 pounds
in the last 16 days.

582
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,600
Before this shenanigan's over,
I'll probably eat enough land...

583
00:44:16,678 --> 00:44:21,012
to incorporate me in the Union,
the state of Groot.

584
00:44:21,717 --> 00:44:23,309
Ow! That hurt!

585
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:27,116
Teeth or no teeth, I can still use me
a whip, and you keep out of that sugar.

586
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:29,589
Too late, Pop.
I already got me some.

587
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:34,823
Having a sweet tooth is almost as bad as
having a whiskey tongue or liking women.

588
00:44:34,897 --> 00:44:39,129
A hundred days. Well, all I got
to worry about is feeding them.

589
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:41,431
Come on! Giddap! Hey!

590
00:44:52,548 --> 00:44:55,676
[ Buster ]
Yee-hoo! Yee!

591
00:44:55,751 --> 00:44:58,720
- [ Simms Whooping ]
- [ Buster ] Hey!

592
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:30,374
Hey, Buster.
How is it down there?

593
00:45:30,452 --> 00:45:33,751
This water is really fine.
Nice and cool.

594
00:45:33,822 --> 00:45:36,256
[ Simms ] Man could take himself
a right good bath.

595
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,152
Matt!

596
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:43,290
What's the matter?

597
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,493
What are you stopping them for?

598
00:45:46,568 --> 00:45:48,559
This water here looks pretty good.

599
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:51,105
There's water
three or four miles on ahead.

600
00:45:51,173 --> 00:45:52,834
The men have had
a pretty tough day.

601
00:45:52,908 --> 00:45:55,103
- I think in all fairness--
- I'll do the thinking.

602
00:45:55,177 --> 00:45:57,111
Keep them going.

603
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:04,885
Hey! Buster, we're moving on.

604
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:06,887

01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:03,502
You're going to be until we finish
the drive. You're going to finish it.

759
01:01:03,581 --> 01:01:07,540
- Teeler, I like what the man says.
- Like it or not, that's it.

760
01:01:09,486 --> 01:01:12,512
Come on and get it,
you hungry hounds.

761
01:01:59,236 --> 01:02:01,761
[ Hoofbeats Approaching ]

762
01:02:20,124 --> 01:02:24,390
[ In Raspy Whisper ] My name's Sutter.
Been riding point for old man Carwood.

763
01:02:24,461 --> 01:02:26,452
Over 2,000 head of--

764
01:02:28,699 --> 01:02:30,792
My neck-- It hurts.

765
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:33,632
They put a rope around it and--

766
01:02:33,704 --> 01:02:35,137
Then they--

767
01:02:36,974 --> 01:02:39,169
That food sure looks good.

768
01:02:39,243 --> 01:02:42,610
Haven't had anything
in over four days, and I'm--

769
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:45,774
Fella gets--

770
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,282
Grab him.

771
01:02:48,552 --> 01:02:50,486
Bring him over here.

772
01:02:56,326 --> 01:02:59,853
That's better.
I was nearly all in.

773
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:02,728
- Want to hear about it now?
- Go ahead.

774
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:07,100
We had nearly 2,000 head of cattle.
Belonged to old man Carwood.

775
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:11,232
Everything went fine until we crossed
the Big Red. Then it happened.

776
01:03:11,308 --> 01:03:14,209
We got as far as the Ouachitas
when they jumped us.

777
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:16,508
How many were in that bunch
that jumped you?

778
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,741
Maybe 100, I guess.

779
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:24,277
They stampeded the cattle, then
picked us up one by one as we came out.

780
01:03:24,354 --> 01:03:26,754
We didn't have a chance,
not a chance.

781
01:03:26,824 --> 01:03:29,315
- Why'd they put a rope on you?
- They did worse than that.

782
01:03:29,393 --> 01:03:32,453
They nailed Carwood's feet and hands
to a wagon wheel.

783
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:34,520
He was dead when I got to him.

784
01:03:34,598 --> 01:03:36,623
- How'd you get loose?
- Just luck.

785
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,634
Rope they put on me
was frayed and broke.

786
01:03:38,702 --> 01:03:43,332
We should never have gone that way.
We should've gone north at the Big Red.

787
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:45,568
Why do you say that?

788
01:03:45,642 --> 01:03:48,406
A fellow named Jess Chisholm,
an Indian trader...

789
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,471
he told me he blazed a trail
all through the nations.

790
01:03:51,548 --> 01:03:55,780
Said we could follow it clear to Kansas.
That way our only worry is Indians.

791
01:03:55,853 --> 01:03:58,515
- Where in Kansas?
- Abilene.

792
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,523
- Said there's a railroad there.
- Railroad?

793
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:02,525
- Railroad in Abilene?
- That's what Cherry said.

794
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:03,855
Did he say he saw it?

795
01:04:05,028 --> 01:04:07,360
Well, l-- l--

796
01:04:09,399 --> 01:04:10,798
I can't remember.

797
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:14,900
Get me a razor.

798
01:04:14,972 --> 01:04:17,907
- Want to come along with us?
- Where to? Missouri?

799
01:04:17,975 --> 01:04:20,307
- Yeah.
- No, I've had enough.

800
01:04:20,377 --> 01:04:23,141
- If you could spare some food though?
- Sure.

801
01:04:27,084 --> 01:04:29,018
I've had enough too.

802
01:04:30,254 --> 01:04:30,587
- What?
- We started a drive we'll never finish.

803
01:04:30,587 --> 01:04:32,418
- What?
- We started a drive we'll never finish.

804
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:36,391
We'll finish the drive, Mailer,
and I'll sell my beef in Missouri.

805
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,394
- What do we eat on the way?
- Beef!

806
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:39,724
What do we drink?

807
01:04:47,237 --> 01:04:48,829
Rainwater, if we have to.

808
01:04:48,906 --> 01:04:51,773
Not me. I'm heading south.

809
01:04:51,842 --> 01:04:55,676
I've had enough, Dunson,
unless we try for Abilene.

810
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,415
And you, Fernandez?

811
01:05:01,919 --> 01:05:06,083
Me, I think this way.
If I'm going to die, I go south to die.

812
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:09,091
At least my people can find my grave
and maybe put flowers on it.

813
01:05:11,695 --> 01:05:15,028
There was an agreement made
when you signed on.

814
01:05:15,098 --> 01:05:18,192
You agreed to finish this drive.

815
01:05:18,268 --> 01:05:19,860
I'm going to hold you to it.

816
01:05:19,937 --> 01:05:22,565
How?

817
01:05:24,608 --> 01:05:26,542
- I don't want to have to kill you.
- With what?

818
01:05:38,288 --> 01:05:40,620
All right, anybody else?

819
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:43,592
Say it now, because I don't
want to ever hear it again.

820
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,628
I don't like quitters...

821
01:05:45,696 --> 01:05:48,665
especially when they're not good enough
to finish what they start.

822
01:05:48,732 --> 01:05:51,929
Speak up! Say it, and you
can join your friends here.

823
01:05:52,002 --> 01:05:53,993
All I want is--
Where are you going?

824
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,535
- I'm going to sit down.
- You got work to do.

825
01:05:58,609 --> 01:06:00,543
Watch it.

826
01:06:00,611 --> 01:06:03,774
I was just getting myself
a drink of water.

827
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:14,255
I'm just listening.

828
01:06:15,826 --> 01:06:20,058
Well, there's quitters
to be buried. I'll--

829
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:24,159
I'll read over them
in the morning.

830
01:06:25,335 --> 01:06:28,498
Planting and reading.
Planting and reading.

831
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:33,600
Fill a man full of lead, stick him in
the ground and then read words at him.

832
01:06:33,677 --> 01:06:38,774
Why when you kill a man, why try to read
the Lord in as a partner on the job?

833
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:54,321
Well?

834
01:06:54,398 --> 01:06:56,628
You didn't have to do that
back there.

835
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,930
- You joined in.
- Yeah, and I thought you were wrong.

836
01:06:59,002 --> 01:07:01,835
- Then why didn't you--
- Don't try and tell me what to think.

837
01:07:01,905 --> 01:07:04,135
I'll take your orders about work
but not about what to think.

838
01:07:04,207 --> 01:07:07,108
- You think I'm to blame for that?
- Just as sure as you're sitting there.

839
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:12,345
- And so?
- So I'll take your orders.

840
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:25,623
- Got you in the leg, huh?
- Yeah.

841
01:07:35,436 --> 01:07:39,236
- Ain't bad.
- Went clean through.

842
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:41,240
Ain't as bad as it should be.

843
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:44,905
You too?
What do you got to say?

844
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:48,380
Nothing. If I did,
you wouldn't listen to it.

845
01:08:03,464 --> 01:08:06,763
- You find them?
- No. They're gone, all right.

846
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:08,768
That's a pretty howdy-do.

847
01:08:08,836 --> 01:08:13,364
You ought to--
No, I better tell him myself.

848
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:21,280
Tom. Tom.

849
01:08:25,586 --> 01:08:28,248
Teeler, Laredo and Bill Kelsey
are gone.

850
01:08:28,322 --> 01:08:30,290
- What?
- They up and left.

851
01:08:31,725 --> 01:08:34,592
-How do you know?
-I went to wake them. They wasn't there.

852
01:08:34,662 --> 01:08:36,630
- When did they go?
- During the night.

853
01:08:37,665 --> 01:08:40,498
They was on second guard.
It could have happened anytime.

854
01:08:40,568 --> 01:08:43,435
Anybody know anything about
Teeler, Kelsey or Laredo?

855
01:08:43,504 --> 01:08:45,938
There ain't no doubt.
I checked the wagon.

856
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:48,304
We're shy some cartridges,
flour and a mite of salt.

857
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,809
- How many cartridges?
- This side of a hundred.

858
01:08:50,878 --> 01:08:52,345
- Flour?
- One sack.

859
01:08:52,413 --> 01:08:54,210
Sneaking yellow--

860
01:08:55,316 --> 01:08:58,342
Well, they're not going to--
Matt, get--

861
01:08:58,419 --> 01:09:01,786
No. Cherry, get mounted,
and take Grant here and Bill--

862
01:09:01,855 --> 01:09:05,188
- Grant will be enough.
- They'll probably head straight south.

863
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:07,352
Find them, and bring them back.

864
01:09:07,428 --> 01:09:09,919
- Supposing they won't come?
- Bring them!

865
01:09:09,997 --> 01:09:12,329
We'll catch up with you.

866
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,334
From now on,
this outfit's going to move.

867
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:16,767
Get them going.

868
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:34,447
Matt? Keep your point moving.
The drag's catching up.

869
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:35,954
Sure.

870
01:09:48,335 --> 01:09:50,030
The Red River ahead!

871
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:53,830
Hey, it's the Red River!

872
01:09:53,907 --> 01:09:56,102
Red River ahead!

873
01:09:57,244 --> 01:09:59,178
Red River ahead!

874
01:10:22,102 --> 01:10:26,038
Hyah! Hi-yah! Hyah!

875
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:46,148
- Well, here's your Red.
- It's quite a river.

876
01:10:47,394 --> 01:10:50,488
We sure had a lot smaller herd
the last time we crossed.

877
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,667
One bull and a cow.

878
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:58,432
Well, this looks like
as good a place as any.

879
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:01,235
This will take us the rest of the day
and part of the night.

880
01:11:01,308 --> 01:11:04,004
- Why not cross fresh in the morning?
- We'll put them across now.

881
01:11:04,078 --> 01:11:07,707
-You got a pretty tired bunch behind us.
-Tired men don't run away.

882
01:11:07,781 --> 01:11:10,409
We can't keep them this wore out
the rest of the drive.

883
01:11:10,484 --> 01:11:13,920
No, but we can keep them this wore out
until Cherry gets back.

884
01:11:13,987 --> 01:11:15,955
Then nobody
will want to run away.

885
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:19,754
- Mark for us, will you, Leather?
- Sure enough.

886
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:40,274
Quicksand out in here!
Mark it!

887
01:11:44,685 --> 01:11:49,247
More of it in here!
Mark it from the stump to the tree!

888
01:11:49,323 --> 01:11:50,813
From the stump to the tree!

889
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:54,156
- How is it up there, Matt?
- Firm all the way!

890
01:11:55,262 --> 01:11:58,163
Bring them on in!
Keep them downstream!

891
01:11:58,232 --> 01:11:59,995
Bring them on!

892
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:03,036
- Matt, watch for strays!
- Right!

893
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:35,358
Come on, cattle!
Get in, cattle!

894
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:39,065
Come on, cattle.
Come on. Get going.

895
01:12:57,825 --> 01:13:00,293
Hyah, cattle! Go!

896
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,089
Come on, cattle!

897
01:13:11,438 --> 01:13:13,406
Hi-yah!

898
01:13:13,474 --> 01:13:14,907
Get over there!

899
01:13:34,695 --> 01:13:38,096
All right, giddap now!
Hyah! Giddap there now!

900
01:13:54,047 --> 01:13:56,447
[ Dunson ]
Straighten out that line!

901
01:13:59,419 --> 01:14:00,852
[ Dunson ]
Keep downstream!

902
01:14:11,832 --> 01:14:13,356
Keep them coming!

903
01:14:19,339 --> 01:14:21,967
Bedroll's right down there, Tom.

904
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:37,319
Have some coffee, Tom?

905
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:38,949
Picked up a few.

906
01:14:40,093 --> 01:14:42,755
We just picked up
a few strays downstream.

907
01:14:42,829 --> 01:14:46,424
All told,
we lost 30 to 40 head.

908
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,937
Better than 9,000 head across in less
than 4 hours. That's awful good, Tom.

909
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:53,131
- Boys did all right.
- Yep.

910
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:55,174
Why don't you tell them so?

911
01:14:57,344 --> 01:14:59,938
That's their job.

912
01:15:00,013 --> 01:15:02,481
They're awful tired.

913
01:15:02,549 --> 01:15:05,051
We won't have to count noses
in the morning.

914
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,487
- That leg bothering you?
- Yeah.

915
01:15:13,559 --> 01:15:15,754
I hooked it on a horn.
It opened up a little.

916
01:15:15,828 --> 01:15:17,819
- I'll take a look at it.
- Wait till morning.

917
01:15:22,635 --> 01:15:26,127
You need sleep, Tom.
You need it bad.

918
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,439
Some nights ago
we lost three men.

919
01:15:30,509 --> 01:15:33,672
I haven't slept since,
and we haven't lost any more.

920
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:36,476
We're not gonna lose any tonight
nor from now on.

921
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:51,059
Why'd we have to cross today? Wouldn't
tomorrow have been just as good?

922
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,621
Dunson's orders. Ask him.

923
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:57,726
We could have waited till morning
instead of finishing after dark.

924
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,398
It don't make sense.
We got a long way to go yet.

925
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:04,136
He's getting worse every day.

926
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:07,976
Sometimes I think he's going
plumb out of his head.

927
01:16:08,047 --> 01:16:12,746
Why tell me? If you feel that way,
what do you tell me for?

928
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,616
l-- I'm sorry. l--

929
01:16:16,722 --> 01:16:18,952
Here.

930
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:21,322
You know, Matt,
things ain't right.

931
01:16:21,393 --> 01:16:25,853
It's him. He's got to get some sleep.
If he don't, something's gonna happen.

932
01:16:25,931 --> 01:16:31,665
All the sleep he's had in the last three
nights wouldn't fill a mouse's ear.

933
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:34,069
He won't sleep until--

934
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,131
Yeah.

935
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:40,941
When do you expect Cherry back,
if he comes?

936
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,140
Tomorrow sometime.

937
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,423
[ Cowboy Whooping ]

938
01:16:57,096 --> 01:16:58,495
[ Irishman ]
Looks like Cherry.

939
01:17:12,244 --> 01:17:14,178
Hyah! Hyah!

940
01:17:25,157 --> 01:17:29,025
Get down off them horses. I don't
favor looking up to the likes of you.

941
01:17:32,831 --> 01:17:36,562
That's better.
You should be crawling.

942
01:17:36,635 --> 01:17:40,162
Cherry, I sent you out after
three of them. You brought back two.

943
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,640
Bill Kelsey figured he'd rather fight.
Made a good one of it for a while.

944
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:46,678
Hmm. Laredo, Teeler...

945
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:50,112
you signed on for the drive,
and you signed on to finish it.

946
01:17:50,182 --> 01:17:53,640
- That's right--
- You stole beans, flour and cartridges.

947
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:56,882
Besides being deserters,
you're common thieves.

948
01:17:56,956 --> 01:17:59,186
- The law might see it different.
- I'm the law. You're a thief!

949
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:03,294
You too, Teeler.
Anything more?

950
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:06,695
I know what you're gonna do to us,
but first I want to tell you something.

951
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,630
- Go ahead.
- You're crazy.

952
01:18:08,701 --> 01:18:12,228
You've been drinking and not sleeping.
If you ain't crazy, you're close.

953
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:13,999
- You through?
- No.

954
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:17,702
You want to get this herd to market.
So do all of us!

955
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:19,903
There's a good way to Abilene,
but you won't listen to that.

956
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:23,881
You want to drive them to Missouri,
when you got everything against you.

957
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,417
I ain't through yet.

958
01:18:26,485 --> 01:18:28,419
This herd don't belong to you.

959
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:31,684
It belongs to every poor, hoping
and praying cattleman in the state.

960
01:18:32,992 --> 01:18:36,519
I shouldn't have run away. I should
have stayed and put a bullet in you.

961
01:18:36,595 --> 01:18:39,530
I signed a pledge, sure,
but you ain't the man I signed it with.

962
01:18:39,598 --> 01:18:41,532
- You finished?
- Yeah.

963
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,832
Now you can get your Bible
and read over us after you shoot us.

964
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:48,830
I'm gonna hang you.

965
01:18:51,277 --> 01:18:54,246
No. No, you're not.

966
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,407
- What?
- You're not going to hang them.

967
01:18:59,218 --> 01:19:00,515
Who'll stop me?

968
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,919
I will.

969
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:42,521
Give me that gun.
Somebody give me--

970
01:19:42,594 --> 01:19:44,221
I'll kill him! Let me go!

971
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:47,197
He was gonna kill me.
He wasn't gonna give me a chance.

972
01:19:48,734 --> 01:19:50,531
Turn him loose.

973
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:54,299
Cherry, give me that gun.
Here's what you've been crying for.

974
01:19:55,174 --> 01:19:57,108
All right. Use it!

975
01:19:57,176 --> 01:19:59,110
Go on.
You got what you wanted.

976
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:03,114
What are you waiting for? If you don't
want to live, all you have to do is--

977
01:20:12,858 --> 01:20:15,656
You're a lucky man, Teeler.

978
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,925
That's how close it came.

979
01:20:19,998 --> 01:20:21,932
Matt, we're getting
as crazy as he is.

980
01:20:26,472 --> 01:20:30,169
Keep it.
You want to finish the drive?

981
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,504
- Where we going?
- Abilene.

982
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,511
- Who's heading it?
- [ Matt ] I am.

983
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,513
What about Dunson?

984
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,278
He stays here.

985
01:20:40,352 --> 01:20:41,614
We're taking the herd.

986
01:20:42,955 --> 01:20:44,980
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm with you, Matt.

987
01:20:45,057 --> 01:20:46,957
I'll go along.

988
01:20:47,025 --> 01:20:49,289
[ Matt ]
Groot? How about you?

989
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,068
You was wrong, Mr. Dunson.

990
01:20:57,136 --> 01:21:00,469
I've been with you a lot of years.

991
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:04,600
Up till now, right or wrong,
I always done like you said.

992
01:21:04,676 --> 01:21:08,510
Got to be a habit with me, I guess,
'cause that's why I'm staying with you.

993
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,016
- Go on with them!
- Thanks.

994
01:21:12,084 --> 01:21:15,815
Thanks for making it easy on me.
All right. I'll be coming with you.

995
01:21:15,888 --> 01:21:18,516
Throw them on the trail.
Start driving.

996
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:24,051
Buster, you wait here
till I get back.

997
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:27,394
You come looking for me, Mr. Dunson,
I'll be in Abilene.

998
01:21:37,776 --> 01:21:39,744
All right, Groot. Get going.

999
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,014
Hyah! Hyah!
[ Whistling ]

1000
01:21:55,928 --> 01:21:59,762
If there's any chance at all,
we'll get your herd to Abilene.

1001
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,324
Cherry was right. You're soft.

1002
01:22:03,402 --> 01:22:06,064
You should have let them kill me,
'cause I'm going to kill you.

1003
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:10,474
I'll catch up with you.
I don't know when, but I'll catch up.

1004
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:15,404
Every time you turn around,
expect to see me.

1005
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:20,418
'Cause one time you'll turn around, and
I'll be there. I'm going to kill you.

1006
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,386
- It's only me.
- I thought--

1007
01:23:34,456 --> 01:23:36,549
- I was scared it was--
- Yeah.

1008
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:39,753
- Got some coffee?
- Yeah.

1009
01:23:40,929 --> 01:23:45,025
I'm an idiot.
Jumping at every sound I hear.

1010
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:49,262
He wouldn't be
coming back yet, would he?

1011
01:23:49,338 --> 01:23:51,829
I don't know.

1012
01:23:51,907 --> 01:23:56,173
You know, Matt.
I've been figuring.

1013
01:23:56,245 --> 01:23:59,146
He'd be a fool to come alone.
Then again, he might.

1014
01:23:59,214 --> 01:24:01,205
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1015
01:24:01,283 --> 01:24:04,081
Most likely he'll ride back
and get men and cartridges.

1016
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:06,279
You took all of his
before we left, didn't you?

1017
01:24:07,956 --> 01:24:11,790
Let me see now.
Nearest place is San Felipe.

1018
01:24:13,128 --> 01:24:15,995
With that bad leg,
he'll have to take it easy.

1019
01:24:16,064 --> 01:24:18,589
It'll take him
at least four days.

1020
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:20,931
He'll pick up men
and start after us.

1021
01:24:21,003 --> 01:24:23,164
That's four more.
That's eight days.

1022
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:25,672
Then at the rate we been traveling,
it's eight days to the river.

1023
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:29,199
Nearer ten.
I've been figuring some myself.

1024
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:32,943
Four more. That's sixteen.

1025
01:24:33,015 --> 01:24:36,507
That's 22 days altogether.

1026
01:24:36,585 --> 01:24:39,019
We've been gone four days.

1027
01:24:39,087 --> 01:24:41,817
Four from twenty-two is--

1028
01:24:42,891 --> 01:24:45,917
That's 18 days from now.

1029
01:24:45,994 --> 01:24:48,519
He couldn't get back
quicker than that, could he?

1030
01:24:48,597 --> 01:24:51,566
If that's the way he does it,
that's figuring pretty fine.

1031
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:55,328
Men are figuring
pretty fine too.

1032
01:24:55,404 --> 01:25:00,307
Snarling and snapping and
jumping at their own shadows.

1033
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:02,935
What do you think will happen
when he does come back?

1034
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:06,609
Yeah, I've been wondering too.

1035
01:25:08,717 --> 01:25:13,780
The way he looked when we left him.
It all happened so fast.

1036
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:18,485
I hadn't--
I hadn't started out--

1037
01:25:19,995 --> 01:25:23,158
I couldn't let him
hang Teeler and Laredo.

1038
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:26,999
You ain't sorry you done it?

1039
01:25:27,069 --> 01:25:29,128
I don't know.

1040
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:32,139
He was wrong.

1041
01:25:33,442 --> 01:25:37,310
Hope I'm right.
Hope there's a railroad in Abilene.

1042
01:25:55,197 --> 01:25:57,688
Hey, Matt! Come here!

1043
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:06,265
Matt, look at this.

1044
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:19,950
- About a day ago.
- Not over a day as I make it.

1045
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:21,984
[ Quo ] Whoa!

1046
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:31,532
Quo?

1047
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:35,335
- Comanche.
- You sure?

1048
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:38,498
- Comanche arrow.
- That's trouble.

1049
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:40,939
Tracks lead north.

1050
01:26:41,009 --> 01:26:43,705
Well, do we go on?

1051
01:26:43,779 --> 01:26:48,648
Which would you rather have?
What's behind, or what might be ahead?

1052
01:26:52,254 --> 01:26:53,915
- Cherry?
- Yeah.

1053
01:26:53,989 --> 01:26:58,619
You and Buster,
go on ahead about 10, 12 miles.

1054
01:26:58,693 --> 01:27:00,820
Enough to give warning.

1055
01:27:00,896 --> 01:27:02,864
Get Groot to give you food.
Take your rifles.

1056
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:05,923
Teeler, see the rest
of the men have theirs.

1057
01:27:06,001 --> 01:27:07,332
[ Groot ] Buster.

1058
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:30,215
[ Footsteps ]

1059
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:42,834
You ought to get yourself
some sleep, Matt.

01:38:52,273 --> 01:38:56,869
We didn't get along very well,
and I want to find out why.

1210
01:38:56,945 --> 01:38:58,970
See, he thought
I was one of a bunch--

1211
01:39:17,532 --> 01:39:20,023
Hold it. Right there.

1212
01:39:20,101 --> 01:39:22,069
It's all right, Buster.
It's me, Matt.

1213
01:39:23,738 --> 01:39:27,970
Whew! [ Chuckling ]
I thought it was--

1214
01:39:28,043 --> 01:39:31,570
Look at me. Fog's got me jumpy.

1215
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,448
Wish it would rain.

1216
01:39:34,516 --> 01:39:37,417
He wouldn't pick you off
in the fog, Buster.

1217
01:39:37,485 --> 01:39:38,918
I know it.

1218
01:39:40,088 --> 01:39:42,682
I ain't seen a thing
till you come by.

1219
01:39:42,757 --> 01:39:44,725
I'll be back at midnight.

1220
01:39:44,793 --> 01:39:48,991
Get Groot to fix you some food.
We're starting in the morning.

1221
01:40:09,984 --> 01:40:12,680
That's the story.
Now you know more about him.

1222
01:40:12,754 --> 01:40:14,187
Yeah.

1223
01:40:15,256 --> 01:40:17,224
What would you do if you were me?

1224
01:40:17,357 --> 01:40:19,587
If I was you? Huh!

1225
01:40:19,659 --> 01:40:22,321
Now, ain't that just like a woman?
I ain't you.

1226
01:40:22,395 --> 01:40:24,659
How far do you think
you'd get with a puss like mine?

1227
01:40:26,132 --> 01:40:29,226
I'd like to talk to him
if he'll talk to me.

1228
01:40:29,302 --> 01:40:31,327
We ain't going to be here
but a few more hours.

1229
01:40:31,404 --> 01:40:33,338
- I know.
- Morning, at the latest, we'll be gone.

1230
01:40:33,406 --> 01:40:36,170
I know that. I still
want to talk to him.

1231
01:40:36,243 --> 01:40:37,733
That's the way you want it, huh?

1232
01:40:38,945 --> 01:40:40,378
That's the way I want it.

1233
01:40:41,381 --> 01:40:44,282
All right.
I'll go see where he's at.

1234
01:40:52,459 --> 01:40:53,892
[ Twigs Snapping ]

1235
01:41:06,606 --> 01:41:07,868
Matthew?

1236
01:41:08,975 --> 01:41:12,001
- Matthew Garth?
- Over here.

1237
01:41:17,617 --> 01:41:21,018
Groot said I'd find you here.
I wanted to talk to you.

1238
01:41:21,087 --> 01:41:23,521
Is it all right?
I wanted to--

1239
01:41:24,658 --> 01:41:28,185
You're shaking.
You thought I was Dunson.

1240
01:41:28,261 --> 01:41:30,729
Yeah.
Hey, how did you know--

1241
01:41:30,797 --> 01:41:33,391
I know a little bit about it.
Groot told me.

1242
01:41:33,466 --> 01:41:37,562
It's funny. I didn't imagine you
being scared. It doesn't seem to fit.

1243
01:41:37,637 --> 01:41:39,832
- It fits.
- I guess it does.

1244
01:41:39,906 --> 01:41:42,568
- It makes things clearer. It helps.
- Helps what?

1245
01:41:42,642 --> 01:41:45,008
I know how you feel.
I'm scared too.

1246
01:41:45,078 --> 01:41:48,070
That's why I'm talking. It's the
best thing to do when you feel that way.

1247
01:41:48,148 --> 01:41:50,082
Just talk and keep on talking.

1248
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:54,314
Really it is. I talk to myself even
if I have to sit in front of a mirror--

1249
01:41:54,387 --> 01:41:56,753
- I can see myself--
- You don't have to do that.

1250
01:41:56,823 --> 01:42:00,190
You can talk to me.
I'm right here. If it would help--

1251
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:02,785
You can tell me to mind
my own business if you'd like.

1252
01:42:02,862 --> 01:42:07,697
If it would help any, you can hit me,
like I did you, right across the mouth.

1253
01:42:07,767 --> 01:42:11,464
It'd be good for you to talk,
and I'd like to talk to you--

1254
01:42:11,538 --> 01:42:15,668
## [ Whistling ]

1255
01:42:20,447 --> 01:42:24,577
Please, I'd really
like to talk to you.

1256
01:42:37,764 --> 01:42:40,699
I'd like it better
than talking to a mirror.

1257
01:42:45,739 --> 01:42:49,971
I want to know more about him.
Why does he think that way?

1258
01:42:51,344 --> 01:42:54,040
Because he got to a place where--

1259
01:42:54,114 --> 01:42:56,947
See, he'd taken empty land
used for nothing...

1260
01:42:57,016 --> 01:42:59,780
made it the biggest ranch
in the state of Texas.

1261
01:42:59,853 --> 01:43:01,821
Fought to keep it.

1262
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:05,016
Flat-nosed bull and one cow.
That's all he started with.

1263
01:43:05,091 --> 01:43:07,525
- And, well--
- Well, what?

1264
01:43:07,594 --> 01:43:11,792
After he'd done all that, gotten
what he'd been after for so long...

1265
01:43:11,865 --> 01:43:13,799
it wasn't worth anything.

1266
01:43:15,034 --> 01:43:17,901
So he started this drive.

1267
01:43:17,971 --> 01:43:20,838
Everyone said, "You can't make it.
You'll never get there."

1268
01:43:20,907 --> 01:43:25,344
- He was the only one who believed
we could. Had to believe.
- [ Thunder Rumbling ]

1269
01:43:29,482 --> 01:43:32,940
So he started thinking one way.
His way.

1270
01:43:33,019 --> 01:43:35,317
He told men what to do
and made them do it.

1271
01:43:35,388 --> 01:43:38,721
Otherwise, we wouldn't
have got as far as we did.

1272
01:43:38,792 --> 01:43:42,728
He started for Missouri,
and all he knew was he had to get there.

1273
01:43:44,798 --> 01:43:46,732
I took his herd away from him.

1274
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,998
You love him, don't you?
He must love you.

1275
01:43:52,071 --> 01:43:54,005
That wouldn't be hard.

1276
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:00,110
Did you like that?

1277
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:03,581
I've always been kind of slow
in making up my mind.

1278
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:05,584
Maybe I can help.

1279
01:44:13,226 --> 01:44:17,128
I don't need any more help,
but will you do that again?

1280
01:44:21,768 --> 01:44:23,861
That was sure good.

1281
01:44:23,937 --> 01:44:27,373
Anybody can fix good vittles,
if they have something to cook.

1282
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:29,635
I'm so hungry,
I could eat anything.

1283
01:44:29,709 --> 01:44:32,371
- Why don't you eat then?
- Quo's out gathering wood.

1284
01:44:32,445 --> 01:44:34,379
Sent him out before I
thought about eating.

1285
01:44:34,447 --> 01:44:35,778
- Hi, Cherry.
- Hi.

1286
01:44:35,849 --> 01:44:38,374
It's raining hard in the hills.
The river's rising.

1287
01:44:38,451 --> 01:44:40,749
If it gets any worse,
we'll have a bad time crossing.

1288
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:43,448
- Don't want to get stuck on this side.
- That's what I was thinking.

1289
01:44:43,523 --> 01:44:46,390
-Somebody ought to tell Matt. He's out--
-I'll tell him.

1290
01:44:46,459 --> 01:44:48,484
Matt, Cherry was saying
it's raining hard up--

1291
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:52,327
Yeah, I heard it.
I was figuring that way myself.

1292
01:44:54,267 --> 01:44:57,668
We're leaving now. Let's get started.
We're crossing tonight.

1293
01:44:57,737 --> 01:45:01,400
Cherry, take the point. Buster,
start the bunch down on the flats first.

1294
01:45:01,474 --> 01:45:04,272
- Get going as soon as you can, Groot.
- Anything else?

1295
01:45:08,948 --> 01:45:12,907
- We can't take her with us, can we?
- Well, we could--

1296
01:45:12,986 --> 01:45:17,446
- What?
- No, I don't suppose we could.

1297
01:45:22,595 --> 01:45:27,032
Where you been? It took you long enough!
Now we're moving. I ain't had dinner!

1298
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:29,034
Come on. Start packing.

1299
01:46:03,336 --> 01:46:06,737
- Be anything else, ma'am?
- Thanks, Danny. That's all.

1300
01:46:14,013 --> 01:46:15,947
Hey, we've got visitors.

1301
01:46:18,718 --> 01:46:21,687
- Hiya, stranger. Where you from?
- Texas.

1302
01:46:21,754 --> 01:46:25,121
-What can we do for you?
-A trail herd through here a while back.

1303
01:46:25,191 --> 01:46:26,783
- That's right.
- When?

1304
01:46:26,859 --> 01:46:29,555
Over a week ago. They helped us out
when the Indians hit us.

1305
01:46:29,629 --> 01:46:32,462
We've been patching up our wounded
and damage before moving on.

1306
01:46:32,532 --> 01:46:37,196
- How far ahead are they?
- They're gone 9 days tomorrow morning.

1307
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:42,207
We're about ready to eat, mister.
You and your men can split a round.

1308
01:46:42,275 --> 01:46:43,867
We'll feed you.

1309
01:46:43,943 --> 01:46:46,275
- Well, thanks, l--
- I'll take care of Mr. Dunson.

1310
01:46:49,949 --> 01:46:53,043
- You two boys--
- A couple of you come with me.

1311
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:57,579
- Two of you boys follow me.
- Couple of you come with me.

1312
01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:08,190
- How did you know my name?
- We can talk about that later.

1313
01:47:08,267 --> 01:47:09,700
Sit down.

1314
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:18,704
I believe it's your beef
we're eating.

1315
01:47:18,778 --> 01:47:22,373
- Who told you that?
- The man you promised to kill.

1316
01:47:22,448 --> 01:47:23,881
He tell you that too?

1317
01:47:25,084 --> 01:47:29,817
You're tired, aren't you? Tired,
hungry and just a little bit irritable.

1318
01:47:29,889 --> 01:47:34,883
You'll feel better after you eat.
We'll talk then.

1319
01:47:34,961 --> 01:47:39,057
- How'd you get that away from him?
- I stole it.

1320
01:48:01,154 --> 01:48:03,816
So you stole that bracelet.

1321
01:48:03,890 --> 01:48:07,291
- How did you get it?
- Would you really like to know?

1322
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,126
- How did you get it?
- I got it in the rain...

1323
01:48:11,197 --> 01:48:13,131
eight days ago...

1324
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:16,362
before he took your herd
across that river and left.

1325
01:48:16,436 --> 01:48:18,131
I'm wondering
whether to believe you.

1326
01:48:18,204 --> 01:48:21,332
- I don't care whether you do or not.
- I believe that.

1327
01:48:21,407 --> 01:48:23,040
- Want to hear more?
- Go ahead.

1328
01:48:23,173 --> 01:48:27,109
It was raining. If it hadn't rained,
I wouldn't be here talking to you.

1329
01:48:27,177 --> 01:48:29,202
He wouldn't be where
you could find him to kill him.

1330
01:48:31,882 --> 01:48:34,851
- Still intend to kill him, don't you?
- Nothing you can say or do--

1331
01:48:34,918 --> 01:48:37,819
I didn't say anything.

1332
01:48:39,122 --> 01:48:41,056
I'll get you another drink.

1333
01:48:44,494 --> 01:48:47,361
So he went off and left you.

1334
01:48:48,432 --> 01:48:51,959
I didn't give him that much credit.

1335
01:48:53,270 --> 01:48:56,728
- You in love with him?
- I thought you'd ask that.

1336
01:48:56,807 --> 01:48:59,071
Can a woman love a man
who'd go off and leave her?

1337
01:48:59,142 --> 01:49:02,236
Well, she--
She shouldn't.

1338
01:49:02,312 --> 01:49:04,576
I wanted to go with him,
but he had work to do.

1339
01:49:04,648 --> 01:49:09,210
He had to get your cattle to market.
Said I wasn't strong enough to go.

1340
01:49:09,286 --> 01:49:11,914
Nothing I could do or say
would change his mind.

1341
01:49:13,857 --> 01:49:16,155
But I wanted to go with him.

1342
01:49:17,227 --> 01:49:19,695
I wanted him so much that--

1343
01:49:19,763 --> 01:49:24,359
That you felt like
you had knives sticking in you.

1344
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:28,804
How did you know that?

1345
01:49:31,274 --> 01:49:33,902
I suppose other people
have felt that way before.

1346
01:49:33,977 --> 01:49:36,810
- I have.
- Tell me something, Mr. Dunson.

1347
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,871
- What?
- Why do you want to kill him?

1348
01:49:38,949 --> 01:49:41,941
- Because he's a thief.
- Do you think he thinks that?

1349
01:49:42,018 --> 01:49:46,921
He should! I picked him up in the brush
leading a cow. That's 14 years ago.

1350
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:48,958
Taught him all I could.

1351
01:49:49,025 --> 01:49:51,084
He knew what I was planning,
saw what I was building.

1352
01:49:52,262 --> 01:49:54,594
He knew that someday
it would all be his.

1353
01:49:54,664 --> 01:49:57,929
His land, his cattle.
The whole thing.

as men will talk.

01:50:01,738 --> 01:50:06,903
A strong woman who could bear him sons.
A woman like you.

1356
01:50:06,977 --> 01:50:09,969
- Why did you want him to have a son?
- Because I'd built something.

1357
01:50:10,046 --> 01:50:14,142
Built it with my owns hands,
and I can't live forever.

1358
01:50:14,217 --> 01:50:16,651
I'd live to see it grow.

1359

what would you say if--

01:50:59,029 --> 01:51:01,497
if I offered you
half of everything I own for a son?

1371
01:51:01,565 --> 01:51:04,796
- Your son?
- You can have a son, can't you?

1372
01:51:04,868 --> 01:51:07,860
By Dunson out of Millay.

1373
01:51:07,938 --> 01:51:10,406
Half of everything you've got.

1374
01:51:10,473 --> 01:51:11,906
That's right.

1375

I'll have your son,
if you'll stop now.

Stop now and go back
where you came from.

- I'll have your son.
- I thought so.

When did you--

1379
01:51:26,554 --> 01:51:30,115
- Did you really hurt that arm?
- I hurt it. It's almost well.

1380
01:51:30,191 --> 01:51:33,627
You can take that gun
out of the sling now.

1381
01:51:37,865 --> 01:51:40,129
Wouldn't have done you any good.

1382
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:44,904
Now, when did you
fall in love with him?

1383
01:51:48,309 --> 01:51:51,244
It was under a wagon.
Six inches of mud.

When did you--

1385

- What?
- When did you fall in love with her?

Who?

1387
01:51:56,684 --> 01:51:59,517
The girl you told me about.
The one you left, walked out on.

1388
01:51:59,587 --> 01:52:01,919
- I told you about? Did he tell--
- You told me.

1389
01:52:02,823 --> 01:52:05,223
You knew how I felt
when he left me.

1390
01:52:05,293 --> 01:52:08,228
She must have felt the same way
when you left her.

1391
01:52:08,296 --> 01:52:12,232
That's right, isn't it?
Well, can't you remember?

1392
01:52:13,734 --> 01:52:15,326
I can remember.

1393
01:52:17,438 --> 01:52:19,167
I hope so, because--

1394
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:22,107
Because I want you to think about her
while I ask you something.

01:52:22,176 --> 01:52:24,440
- I want you to think hard.
- What?

1396
01:52:24,512 --> 01:52:27,310
- I want to go on with you.
- That won't do any good.

- I know, you told me.

I been thinking
that Abilene just ain't.

We probably missed it.

We'll probably keep going

We'll find it.

If we do find it, it'll be awful tough
if the railroad ain't there.

01:53:49,597 --> 01:53:52,794
- It's gotta be there.
- But if it ain't?

1415
01:53:52,867 --> 01:53:54,960
We'll keep driving
till we find it.

- Or until Dunson finds us.

Or you can follow the track.
It's a little longer.

02:00:23,322 --> 02:00:26,291
Looks like you're gonna buy yourself
a lot of beef, Mr. Melville.

1507
02:00:26,358 --> 02:00:29,657
If that engineer was here,
I'd get him to blow his whistle again.

1508
02:00:29,728 --> 02:00:32,959
All right. I'll draw up a contract
and have it ready tonight.

1509
02:00:33,031 --> 02:00:35,966
Buster and I'll ask around and find out
what you're going to have to pay.

1510
02:00:36,034 --> 02:00:37,797
We'll be back in a couple hours.

1511
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:40,566
You need anything else?
Need some cash?

1512
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,233
I sure could use some.
I'd like to pay off the men.

1513
02:00:43,308 --> 02:00:46,004
All right. It'll be ready
and waiting for you tonight.

1514
02:00:46,078 --> 02:00:47,841
All right.
Thanks, Mr. Melville.

1515
02:00:47,913 --> 02:00:50,177
- So long.
- So long.

1516
02:01:07,065 --> 02:01:11,161
They crossed here, all right.
Not over four or five hours ahead.

1517
02:01:44,403 --> 02:01:45,995
Here you are, Matt.

1518
02:01:46,071 --> 02:01:48,130
You'll have to sign this.

1519
02:01:48,206 --> 02:01:51,141
This is a check
to Thomas Dunson for $50,000.

1520
02:01:51,209 --> 02:01:54,770
The rest will be paid when
the tally's finished at $21 a head.

1521
02:01:54,846 --> 02:01:56,780
You see, I've taken
a credit here for...

1522
02:01:56,848 --> 02:01:59,476
the money you wanted
to pay off your men.

1523
02:01:59,551 --> 02:02:01,348
I suppose--

1524
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:03,445
I suppose they'll be celebrating.

1525
02:02:03,522 --> 02:02:06,184
- They've got a right to.
- Of course they have.

1526
02:02:06,258 --> 02:02:10,194
There's three times in a man's life
when he can yell at the moon.

1527
02:02:10,262 --> 02:02:13,425
When he marries,
when his children come...

1528
02:02:13,498 --> 02:02:14,795
and...

1529
02:02:14,866 --> 02:02:17,528
and when he finishes a job
he had to be crazy to start.

1530
02:02:19,538 --> 02:02:21,529
Well, when do you expect
to be leaving, Matt?

1531
02:02:21,606 --> 02:02:23,164
I don't exactly know.

1532
02:02:24,443 --> 02:02:26,843
You're gonna wait
for Dunson, huh?

1533
02:02:26,912 --> 02:02:29,676
I've been talking
to some of your men.

1534
02:02:29,748 --> 02:02:32,740
Isn't that check
and the fact that you got here--

1535
02:02:32,818 --> 02:02:34,752
Isn't that gonna make
any difference?

1536
02:02:36,588 --> 02:02:38,351
I don't think so, Mr. Melville.

1537
02:02:38,423 --> 02:02:40,015
I suppose I'm crazy, but--

1538
02:02:40,092 --> 02:02:43,255
- You want me to run away?
- No.

1539
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,761
Of course not.

1540
02:02:49,034 --> 02:02:50,296
Couldn't--

1541
02:02:50,369 --> 02:02:52,894
Couldn't I talk to him?

1542
02:02:52,971 --> 02:02:55,064
I'd still have to talk
to him after that.

1543
02:02:57,776 --> 02:02:59,368
Good night, Mr. Melville.

1544
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:04,313
- Get a good night's sleep.
- Yeah, I could use some.

1545
02:03:04,383 --> 02:03:05,975
Good night.

1546
02:03:11,757 --> 02:03:14,317
- Evening, Mr. Melville.
- Evening.

1547
02:03:19,431 --> 02:03:22,594
Well, work's not done yet, huh?

1548
02:03:22,667 --> 02:03:24,294
No, sir.

1549
02:03:24,369 --> 02:03:26,860
Well, you fellas see
you get her done.

1550
02:03:26,938 --> 02:03:28,735
I like that boy too.

1551
02:03:33,512 --> 02:03:35,776
I'll buy the drinks
when it's over.

1552
02:04:09,815 --> 02:04:12,443
He's camped two or three miles
outside of town.

1553
02:04:12,517 --> 02:04:14,280
He says he'll be here
just after sunup.

1554
02:04:15,187 --> 02:04:17,121
He says he's going to kill you.

1555
02:04:22,928 --> 02:04:24,862
What's the matter?
Is something--

1556
02:04:26,465 --> 02:04:28,057
I must look
like I'm in mourning.

1557
02:04:28,133 --> 02:04:30,601
I didn't mean it that way,
or I wouldn't have--

1558
02:04:33,138 --> 02:04:34,400
No, Matthew.

1559
02:04:34,473 --> 02:04:36,407
I know you've only
a few hours, but--

1560
02:04:36,475 --> 02:04:38,705
but listen for just a minute,
that's all.

1561
02:04:38,777 --> 02:04:42,406
Then I won't talk about it anymore.
Just a minute.

1562
02:04:42,481 --> 02:04:44,415
He hasn't changed
his mind, Matthew.

1563
02:04:44,483 --> 02:04:46,917
- I didn't think he would.
- We saw the railroad, and I thought--

1564
02:04:46,985 --> 02:04:49,249
I thought it might make a difference,
but it didn't.

1565
02:04:49,321 --> 02:04:52,256
Nothing would.
He's like something you can't move.

1566
02:04:52,324 --> 02:04:55,760
Even I've gotten to believe
it's got to happen, your meeting.

1567
02:04:55,827 --> 02:04:57,852
I was going to ask you to run, but--

1568
02:04:57,929 --> 02:05:00,557
No, I'm not. I'm not!
It wouldn't do any good.

1569
02:05:00,632 --> 02:05:02,691
You're too much like him.

1570
02:05:02,767 --> 02:05:04,894
Oh, stop me, Matthew.
Stop me--

1571
02:05:09,007 --> 02:05:10,770
God bless you, Matthew.

1572
02:05:45,210 --> 02:05:47,144
- [ Matt ] Morning.
- [ Men ] Morning.

1573
02:05:49,614 --> 02:05:51,206
Got a match, Walt?

1574
02:06:23,915 --> 02:06:26,406
I told you all
where you stand in this.

1575
02:06:28,486 --> 02:06:30,420
See that you remember it.

1576
02:06:50,175 --> 02:06:52,166
[ Whooping ]

1577
02:06:56,748 --> 02:06:58,215
Hey!

1578
02:07:04,623 --> 02:07:06,284
He's got plenty with him.

1579
02:07:06,358 --> 02:07:08,121
- How many?
- Oh, ten or twelve.

1580
02:07:08,193 --> 02:07:10,457
- I'll be telling Matt.
- Right.

1581
02:07:25,909 --> 02:07:29,140
He's coming in now.
Got about ten with him.

1582
02:08:51,161 --> 02:08:54,995
You know that young man isn't
going to use his gun, don't you?

1583
02:08:55,065 --> 02:08:56,327
Yeah.

1584
02:08:57,734 --> 02:08:59,793
But I haven't any such notion.

1585
02:09:03,473 --> 02:09:04,906
Mr. Dunson.

1586
02:09:05,976 --> 02:09:08,570
Mr. Dunson.
I'll say it just one more time.

1587
02:09:29,499 --> 02:09:30,761
Go on. Draw.

1588
02:09:34,104 --> 02:09:35,571
I said, "Draw."

1589
02:09:41,878 --> 02:09:43,470
Then I'll make you.

1590
02:09:56,826 --> 02:09:58,691
You're soft!

1591
02:09:58,762 --> 02:10:01,697
Won't anything make
a man out of you?

1592
02:10:01,765 --> 02:10:04,859
You once told me never to take
your gun away from you.

1593
02:10:06,736 --> 02:10:09,227
You yellow-bellied,
chicken-livered--

1594
02:10:23,553 --> 02:10:25,145
All right!

1595
02:10:25,221 --> 02:10:27,815
For 14 years I've been scared,
but it's gonna be all right.

1596
02:10:31,127 --> 02:10:33,322
Get up.
Come on. Get up!

1597
02:10:52,882 --> 02:10:54,577
Stop it!

1598
02:10:54,651 --> 02:10:56,209
Stop making a holy--

1599
02:10:56,286 --> 02:10:59,517
"Stop it," I said! I'm mad,
good and mad, and who wouldn't be?

1600
02:10:59,589 --> 02:11:01,716
You, Dunson, pretending
you're going to kill him!

1601
02:11:01,791 --> 02:11:03,383
It's the last thing
in the world--

1602
02:11:03,460 --> 02:11:05,394
Stay still!
I'm mad, I told you.

1603
02:11:05,462 --> 02:11:06,554
And you, Matthew Garth.

1604
02:11:06,629 --> 02:11:09,723
Getting your face all beat up
and all bloody!

1605
02:11:09,799 --> 02:11:12,029
You ought to see
how silly you look.

1606
02:11:12,102 --> 02:11:15,037
Like something the cat dragged--
Stay still!

1607
02:11:15,105 --> 02:11:16,970
What a fool I've been.

1608
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,803
Expecting trouble
for days when...

1609
02:11:18,875 --> 02:11:21,605
anybody with half a mind would know
you two love each other.

1610
02:11:21,678 --> 02:11:23,908
It took somebody else to shoot you.
He wouldn't do it.

1611
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:26,847
- Are you hurt?
- No, just nicked the fat.

1612
02:11:26,916 --> 02:11:29,146
Then stay still!
No, don't stay still.

1613
02:11:29,219 --> 02:11:32,211
I changed my mind.
Go ahead. Beat each other crazy.

1614
02:11:32,288 --> 02:11:34,222
Maybe it'll put some sense
in both of you.

1615
02:11:34,290 --> 02:11:36,053
Go ahead! Go on! Do it!

1616
02:11:36,126 --> 02:11:38,321
Use this.
Oh, you can't. It's his.

1617
02:11:43,099 --> 02:11:45,158
You'd better marry
that girl, Matt.

1618
02:11:45,235 --> 02:11:47,430
Yeah, I think I'd--

1619
02:11:47,504 --> 02:11:50,439
When are you going to stop
telling people what to do?

1620
02:11:53,309 --> 02:11:56,301
Right now.
At least as soon as--

1621
02:11:56,379 --> 02:11:57,812
When?

1622
02:11:57,881 --> 02:11:59,815
As soon as I tell you
one thing more.

1623
02:11:59,883 --> 02:12:01,441
What?

1624
02:12:01,518 --> 02:12:05,079
When we get back to the ranch,
I want you to change the brand.

1625
02:12:05,155 --> 02:12:06,588
It'll be like this.

1626
02:12:07,857 --> 02:12:10,621
Red River D...

1627
02:12:10,693 --> 02:12:13,025
and we'll add an M to it.

1628
02:12:14,397 --> 02:12:16,092
You don't mind that, do you?

1629
02:12:17,333 --> 02:12:18,595
No.

1630
02:12:23,206 --> 02:12:24,833
You've earned it.
