1
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,279
Holy mackerel!

2
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,362
Call headquarters. Get the lieutenant.

3
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:03,763
Holy Christmas!
That thing's doing about 4,000!

4
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:08,965
- But that's incredible, sir. - That can't
be aircraft. Must be a buzz bomb.

5
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:13,126
This is Luckton at Ferris to Charlie Baker.

6
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:18,329
I have a bogey at 200,000 feet.
4,000 miles an hour.

7
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:38,094
Reports are coming in from
all over the Empire, all over the world.

8
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:42,254
The government has not yet issued
a statement, but there is no question

9
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:47,456
that there actually is a large, unidentified
object circling the Earth at incredible speed.

10
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:49,536
This is Elmer Davis again.

11
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:54,737
We still don't know what it is or where it
comes from, but there's something there.

12
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:59,940
It's been tracked around the Earth by radar,
travelling at a rate of 4,000 miles an hour.

13
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:03,059
This is not another "flying saucer" scare.

14
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,303
Scientists and military men are already agreed
on that. Whatever it is, it's something real.

15
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:14,503
We interrupt this programme to give
you a bulletin from a naval unit at sea.

16
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:19,705
An object travelling at supersonic speed is
headed towards the East Coast of the States.

17
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:22,825
This is HV Kaltenborn speaking.

18
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:28,027
Here in the nation's capital there is anxiety
and concern, but no outward sign of panic.

19
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:34,269
As a matter of fact, there are signs
of normalcy - the beautiful spring weather,

20
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,430
the tourist crowds around
the public monuments and other buildings.

21
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:13,095
They're here!

22
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:16,217
They've landed! Over on the Mall!
They've landed!

23
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:03,030
- Get me the Chief of Staff.
- Thank you. Hold the line, please.

24
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:08,232
Hello. I want to speak to the president.

25
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,353
I'm sorry, but you'll have to interrupt him.

26
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,953
Good afternoon. This is Drew Pearson.

27
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:16,553
We bring you this special broadcast

28
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:21,755
in order to give you the very latest
information on an amazing phenomenon:

29
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,836
the arrival of a spaceship in Washington.

30
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:29,038
Government and Defense Department
officials are concerned by reports of panic

31
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,117
in several large eastern cities.

32
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:37,359
I am authorised to assure you that, so far,
there is no reasonable cause for alarm.

33
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,560
The rumours of invading armies
and mass destruction are based on hysteria

34
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:44,641
and are absolutely false.

35
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:48,802
I repeat, these rumours are absolutely false.

36
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:52,964
The ship, designed for travel
outside the Earth's atmosphere,

37
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:59,206
Landed in Washington today
at 3.47pm Eastern Standard Time.

38
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:01,285
We still do not know where it came from.

39
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:05,447
The ship is now resting
exactly where it landed two hours ago,

40
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:08,567
and so far there is
no sign of life from inside it.

41
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:12,729
Troops have been rushed across
the Potomac River from Fort Myer

42
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,809
and have thrown a cordon around the ship.

43
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,931
They are supported by tanks,
artillery and machine guns.

44
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,091
Behind the police lines
there's a huge crowd of curiosity seekers.

45
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:27,294
The army has taken every precaution
to meet any emergency which may develop.

46
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,454
Every eye, every weapon
is trained on the ship.

47
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:35,616
It's been that way for two hours,
and the tension is just beginning...

48
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:39,778
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.
I think something is happening.

49
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:47,395
We have come to visit you
in peace, and with goodwill.

50
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,929
It was a gift for your president.

51
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,091
With this, he could have
studied life on the other planets.

52
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:16,494
Get that ambulance over here.
Take him to Walter Reed Hospital right away.

53
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:19,614
Mr Harley, sir, from the White House.

54
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,696
- General.
- Right in there, Mr Harley.

55
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,419
My name is Harley,
secretary to the president.

56
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,621
I've been told you speak our language,
and that your name is Mr... Klaatu?

57
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:46,661
Just Klaatu.

58
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:50,823
The president conveys his
deepest apologies for what happened.

59
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:52,903
Sit down, Mr Harley.

60
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,984
Thank you.

61
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:03,307
I'm sure I need hardly point out that
your arrival was something of a surprise.

62
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:05,907
Had you been travelling long?

63
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:08,248
About five months. Your months.

64
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:10,978
You must have come a long way.

65
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:13,709
About 250 million of your miles.

66
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,911
Naturally, we are very curious
to know where you come from.

67
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:20,990
From another planet.

68
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:23,071
Let's just say that we're neighbours.

69
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:26,192
It's hard for us to think
of a planet as a neighbour.

70
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:29,833
In the present situation
you'll have to learn to think that way.

71
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:33,474
- The present situation?
- I mean the reason for my coming here.

72
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:36,594
We're very curious about that, too.

73
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:39,716
- Would you care to talk about it?
- I'd be glad to.

74
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:43,877
Not now, of course, with you alone.

75
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:46,997
You'd rather talk personally
with the president?

76
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:53,240
This is not a personal matter, Mr Harley.
It concerns all the people on your planet.

77
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:55,321
I... I'm not sure I understand.

78
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:02,603
I want to meet with representatives
from all the nations of the Earth.

79
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,683
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward.

80
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:06,764
It's completely without precedent.

81
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:13,005
And there are practical considerations -
the time involved, the enormous distances.

82
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:15,087
I travelled 250 million miles.

83
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:18,207
I appreciate that, but...

84
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:23,408
I want to be frank with you, Mr...
I mean Klaatu.

85
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:30,690
Our world at the moment
is full of tensions and suspicions.

86
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:34,852
In the present international situation,
such a meeting would be quite impossible.

87
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:36,932
What about your United Nations?

88
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:40,052
You know about the United Nations?

89
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:43,172
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts
for a good many years.

90
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:48,375
- That's how we learned your languages.
- I'm sure you recognise from our broadcasts

91
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:52,536
the evil forces that have produced
the trouble in our world. Surely...

92
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:55,657
I'm not concerned with
the internal affairs of your planet.

93
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:59,817
My mission here is not
to solve your petty squabbles.

94
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:02,939
It concerns the existence
of every last creature on Earth.

95
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,060
Perhaps if you could explain a little...

96
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:10,222
I intend to explain.
To all the nations, at the same time.

97
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:13,343
How do we proceed, Mr Harley?

98
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:20,625
Well, we could call a special meeting
of the General Assembly.

99
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,744
But the UN doesn't represent all the nations.

100
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:26,865
Then I suggest a meeting
of all the chiefs of state.

101
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:31,027
Believe me, you don't understand.
They wouldn't sit down to the same table.

102
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:35,187
I don't want to resort to threats, Mr Harley.

103
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:38,308
I merely tell you that
the future of your planet is at stake.

104
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,470
I urge that you transmit that message
to the nations of the Earth.

105
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:52,874
I will make that recommendation
to the president.

106
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,115
But I must tell you in all honesty,
I'm extremely dubious about the results.

107
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:03,275
Apparently I'm not as cynical
about Earth's people as you are.

108
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:07,438
I have been dealing in Earth's politics
a good deal longer than you have.

109
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:10,558
Good night, sir.

110
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:24,081
It is now 2am, and the giant robot
still hasn't moved.

111
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:28,243
Engineers from nearby Fort Belvoir
have failed to budge him,

112
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:32,404
and metallurgical experts
have found his huge body impregnable.

113
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:36,564
They're now concentrating on
the ship itself, so far with no results.

114
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:54,249
Getting anyplace, Sergeant?

115
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,370
Oh, no, sir. This beats me, sir.

116
00:16:57,371 --> 00:17:02,572
I saw the ramp come through the side of the
ship right here. Now I can't even find a crack.

117
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:07,773
Oh, Carlson. What's the report?

118
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:12,975
No luck, sir. We've tried everything
from a blowtorch to a diamond drill.

119
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:17,656
- What about him?
- He's made out of the same stuff.

120
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:20,517
- Has he moved, Sergeant?
- No, sir. Not an inch.

121
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:23,508
This is the toughest material
I ever saw, General.

122
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,565
For hardness and strength,
it's out of this world.

123
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:29,620
I can tell you officially
that's where it came from!

124
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,820
The skeletal structure's completely normal.

125
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:40,022
The tests show the same for major organs -
the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.

126
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:42,102
Yeah, and the lungs are the same as ours.

127
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:46,265
That must mean a similar atmosphere,
similar pressure.

128
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:51,465
- How old do you think he is?
- Oh, I'd say 35, 38.

129
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:54,587
He told me this morning
while I was examining him. He's 78.

130
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:57,706
- Well, I don't believe it.
- Life expectancy is 130.

131
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,868
- How does he explain that?
- Says their medicine's much more advanced.

132
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:07,069
He was very nice about it, but he
made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.

133
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:15,392
I removed a bullet
from that man's arm yesterday.

134
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:19,552
- Well, what about it?
- I just examined the wound, and it's healed.

135
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:23,715
- What does he say about it?
- Said he put salve on it, stuff he had on him.

136
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:27,875
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Take it downstairs and have it analysed.

137
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:33,078
Then I don't know whether to just get drunk
or give up the practice of medicine.

138
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,318
- Afternoon, Mr Harley.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

139
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,721
Good afternoon.
I'm glad to see you up and around.

140
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:54,923
- Thank you. Have you any news?
- Not very good news, I'm afraid.

141
00:18:55,964 --> 00:19:01,165
The president accepted your suggestion,
and cabled the invitations for a meeting.

142
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:06,366
Let me read you some of the replies.

143
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:13,647
"The premier wishes
to inform the US Government

144
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:16,770
it will be impossible for him to attend
the meeting suggested by the president,

145
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:19,891
unless the meeting is held in Moscow."

146
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:25,091
"The suggestion of the president
of the possibility of a meeting in Moscow

147
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:29,252
would be unacceptable to
His Majesty's Government at present."

148
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:34,454
"Representation could be sent only
if the meeting were held in Washington."

149
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:36,536
Well, there you have it.

150
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:44,857
Now you understand more clearly, perhaps
you'd like to discuss it with the president.

151
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,977
I will not speak with
any one nation or group of nations.

152
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:52,140
I don't intend to add my contribution
to your childish jealousies.

153
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:55,259
Our problems are very complex, Klaatu.

154
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,380
- You mustnt judge us too harshly.
- I can judge only by what I see.

155
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:03,063
- Your impatience is quite understandable.
- I'm impatient with stupidity.

156
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:07,743
- My people have learned to live without it.
- I'm afraid my people haven't.

157
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:10,864
I am very sorry.

158
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:12,945
I wish it were otherwise.

159
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,711
Before making any decisions, I think
I should get out among your people,

160
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:37,912
and become familiar with the basis
for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

161
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:41,033
Under the circumstances,
I'm afraid that's impossible.

162
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:45,194
I must ask that you don't try
to leave the hospital.

163
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:47,274
Our military people have insisted on this.

164
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:50,396
I'm sure you understand.

165
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:34,088
- The man from the spaceship got away!
- What? Get every available man.

166
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:14,658
Hospital authorities refuse
to comment on how he managed to escape...

167
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:24,021
He's not eight feet tall, as reported,
nor does he have tentacles...

168
00:22:24,022 --> 00:22:27,141
There's no denying
a monster is at large,

169
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:31,302
and we are dealing with forces
beyond our knowledge and power.

170
00:22:31,303 --> 00:22:37,545
The public is advised to take ordinary
precautions and to remain calm as we await...

171
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:50,028
until they've had an opportunity
to study the ship.

172
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:55,230
They seem to agree, however, that either
Venus or Mars is the most likely possibility.

173
00:22:55,231 --> 00:23:00,431
Not only are these the closest planets
to Earth, but all research to date indicates

174
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:03,552
they are the only two planets
capable of sustaining life as we know it.

175
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:09,794
However, all reputable scientists
warn against jumping to hasty conclusions.

176
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:12,913
Professor Havemeyer of MIT, for example,

177
00:23:12,914 --> 00:23:16,035
points out its possible,
in light of our meagre knowledge.

178
00:23:16,035 --> 00:23:22,278
The president has urged all citizens to be on
the alert for any information about this man,

179
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:27,479
and to transmit such information immediately
to the police, the army or the FBI.

180
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,600
While the president made no effort
to minimise the crisis,

181
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:34,760
he urged people all over the country
to remain calm.

182
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,882
And I might add, that though
this man maybe our bitter enemy,

183
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:41,001
he could be also a new-found friend.

184
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:46,204
- Unfortunately, the only photos we have...
- Mom, do you think I could...?

185
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:49,324
- Hey, who's that?
-..do not show the man's face.

186
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:54,527
The president said the entire facilities
of the FBI and every other federal agency

187
00:23:54,528 --> 00:23:56,606
are being brought to bear.

188
00:23:56,607 --> 00:24:00,766
He pointed out, however,
that this is no ordinary manhunt.

189
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:04,929
He warned "We maybe up against
powers that are beyond our control..."

190
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:19,493
- What is it you want?
- My name is Carpenter. I need a room.

191
00:24:19,494 --> 00:24:21,574
- Oh, I see.
- Are you an FBI man?

192
00:24:23,654 --> 00:24:27,815
- No, I'm afraid not. - I'll bet he is.
He's looking for the spaceman.

193
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,895
We've all been hearing
too much about spacemen.

194
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:33,017
- This is Mrs Benson, Mr Carpenter.
- How do you do?

195
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:35,096
And little Bobby.

196
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:39,258
- Mr and Mrs Barley. And Mr Krull.
- How do you do?

197
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:41,339
And I'm Mrs Crockett.

198
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:47,580
I have a very nice room on the second floor.
It gets the sun all day long.

199
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:50,701
Can I help you look for the spaceman?
I know what he looks like.

200
00:24:50,702 --> 00:24:56,943
- He's got a big square head with three eyes.
- That's enough, Bobby. It's late. Excuse me.

201
00:24:56,944 --> 00:25:01,105
We mustn't annoy Mr Carpenter,
or he won't want to stay here.

202
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:05,266
He's really a dear little boy,
and quiet as a mouse.

203
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:10,467
- You're a long way from home, aren't you?
- How did you know?

204
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,587
Oh. I can tell a New England accent
a mile away.

205
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:21,910
Now we take you to Miami Beach,
Florida, fork report from Gabriel Heatter.

206
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:22,950
Mr Heatter?

207
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:27,111
And now on this Sunday morning
we ask some questions

208
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:30,233
that have been haunting
the entire nation for two whole days.

209
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:35,433
This creature: where is he? What is he up to?

210
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:39,075
If he can build a spaceship
that can fly to Earth,

211
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:42,716
and a robot that can
destroy our tanks and guns,

212
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:45,836
what other terrors can he unleash at will?

213
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,956
Obviously, the monster must be found.

214
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:51,038
He must be tracked down like a wild animal.

215
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,118
He must be destroyed.

216
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,760
But where would such a creature hide?

217
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:59,360
Would he disappear into the north woods?

218
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:03,522
Would he crawl into the sewers
of some great city?

219
00:26:03,523 --> 00:26:06,642
Everybody agrees there is grave danger.

220
00:26:06,643 --> 00:26:10,803
The question remains:
what can we do to protect ourselves?

221
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:17,045
What measures can we take to neutralize this
menace from another world?

222
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:20,165
Destroy it? Of course, but how?

223
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:24,326
And if we do destroy it,
what do we face in retaliation?

224
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:29,529
- It's not a simple problem... - George,
turn it off. I'm trying to concentrate.

225
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,610
Why doesn't the government do something?

226
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:34,731
What can they do?
They're only people, like us.

227
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:37,851
People, my foot! They're Democrats.

228
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:38,892
It gives you the shakes.

229
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:44,093
He's got that robot standing there,
just waiting for orders to destroy us.

230
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:48,254
This spaceman, or whatever he is.
We automatically assume he's a menace.

231
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:51,375
- Maybe he isn't at all.
- Then what's he hiding for?

232
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:55,536
- Why doesn't he come out in the open?
- Like Heatter says, "What's he up to?"

233
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:58,657
- Maybe he's afraid.
- He's afraid!

234
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:02,818
Well, after all, he was shot
the minute he landed here.

235
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:08,019
- I was just wondering what I would do.
- Perhaps before deciding on any action,

236
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,221
you'd want to know more about the people,
to orient yourself in a strange environment.

237
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:18,423
- There's nothing strange about Washington.
- A person from another planet may disagree.

238
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:22,584
If you want my opinion,
he comes from right here on Earth.

239
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:24,664
And you know where I mean.

240
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,785
They wouldn't come in a spaceship.
Only planes.

241
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:29,866
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

242
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:34,027
That fellow wants something,
otherwise he wouldn't be here.

243
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,107
That right, Mr. Carpenter?

244
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:38,188
I'm a little confused.

245
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:42,350
Oh, Mrs. Benson,
Mr. Stevens is here to see you.

246
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:44,428
Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

247
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,591
George, finish your coffee. I promised
the Carsons I'd be there at 11.

248
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,752
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

249
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:58,993
We're set. I put gas in the car and the radio's
broken, so we can forget about the spaceman.

250
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:02,113
There's one thing.
I haven't anyone to stay with Bobby.

251
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:06,275
- I don't suppose we could take him with us?
- Well... Well, we could.

252
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:10,436
There's always someone here,
but today they've all got plans.

253
00:28:10,437 --> 00:28:12,518
I haven't any plans.

254
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,679
I'd be happy to spend the day with him,
if youd let me.

255
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,280
Say, that would be great. Wouldn't it?

256
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,880
It's awfully nice of you to suggest it.

257
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,040
- Sorry. Mr. Carpenter, this is Tom Stevens.
- How do you do, Mr. Carpenter?

258
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,121
Hello.

259
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:32,283
Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday
afternoon. We talked and listened to the radio.

260
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:36,445
I thought today he might like
to show me around the city.

261
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:40,605
- Well...
- Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it?

262
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:42,685
Fine.

263
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:45,807
- You think it's all right?
- Sure.

264
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,451
That's my father. He was killed at Anzio.

265
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:23,256
Did all those people die in wars?

266
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:26,898
Most of 'em. Didn't you ever
hear of the Arlington Cemetery?

267
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:30,539
- No, I'm afraid not.
- You don't seem to know much of anything.

268
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,221
Well, I'll tell you, Bobby,
I've been away a long time. Very far away.

269
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:38,861
Is it different where you've been?
Don't they have places like this?

270
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,982
They have cemeteries, but not like this one.

271
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:45,103
You see, they don't have any wars.

272
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:47,184
Gee, that's a good idea.

273
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:51,345
- What would you like to do?
- Go to the movies.

274
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:52,385
- All right.
- No fooling?

275
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:55,505
No fooling.

276
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:59,666
Bobby, tell me, do you have
to have money to go there?

277
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:04,869
- I've got two dollars. Mom gave it to me.
- No. I want to take you to the movie.

278
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:07,989
Do you think they'd accept these?

279
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,109
Gee, they look like diamonds!

280
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,230
In some places,
those are what people use for money.

281
00:30:14,232 --> 00:30:19,432
- They're easier to carry and don't wear out.
- I'll bet they're worth a million dollars.

282
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,513
Would you give me your $2 for two of these?

283
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:23,593
Well...

284
00:30:23,594 --> 00:30:25,154
Sure.

285
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:26,715
OK.

286
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:31,915
Let's not say anything to Mom
about this, though.

287
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:36,077
- Why not, Bobby?
- She doesn't like me to steal from people.

288
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:02,085
Those are great words.

289
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:06,245
- He must have been a great man.
- Well, sure.

290
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:22,889
That's the kind of man I'd like to talk to.

291
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,051
Bobby, who's the greatest man
in America today?

292
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,171
I don't know. The spaceman, I guess.

293
00:31:31,212 --> 00:31:35,374
No, I was speaking of earthmen.
I meant the greatest philosopher or thinker.

294
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:39,534
- You mean the smartest man in the world?
- Yes, that would do nicely.

295
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:42,655
Professor Barnhardt, I guess.
He's the greatest scientist.

296
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:45,776
- He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
- Near where Mom works.

297
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:48,897
- Where's that?
- Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.

298
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:54,098
That man they call the secretary isn't
at all. My mom's a real secretary.

299
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:58,260
Mr. Carpenter,
now can we go see the spaceship?

300
00:31:58,261 --> 00:32:00,341
If you like.

301
00:32:13,864 --> 00:32:18,025
I'll bet that iron guy's strong
and could knock down a whole building.

302
00:32:18,026 --> 00:32:20,105
I shouldn't be at all surprised.

303
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:25,307
I'd like to get inside that ship, see how
it works. What do you think makes it go?

304
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:29,469
A highly developed form
of atomic power, I should imagine.

305
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,548
I thought that was only for bombs.

306
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,669
No. No, it's for lots of other things, too.

307
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:38,831
- Do you think it can go faster than
the F-86? - Yes, I should think so.

308
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,472
- About 1,000 miles an hour?
- Maybe 4,000 miles an hour.

309
00:32:42,473 --> 00:32:46,113
And outside the Earth's atmosphere,
a good deal faster.

310
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:48,192
How could they make a landing?

311
00:32:48,193 --> 00:32:51,313
There are several ways
to reduce landing speed.

312
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:55,476
You see, the basic problem
is to overcome the inertia...

313
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:58,596
Keep going, mister. He was fallin' for it!

314
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:07,439
Thank you, Mrs. Robinson. I'm sure we've all
shared your fears during the past few days.

315
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,120
I see a gentleman here with his little boy.
What do you think of the spaceship, son?

316
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:15,240
It's the biggest spaceship I ever saw.

317
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:19,401
- And you, sir. Mind telling us your name?
- My name is Carpenter.

318
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:23,563
Care to say a few words? I suppose
you're just as scared as the rest of us.

319
00:33:23,564 --> 00:33:25,643
In a different way, perhaps.

320
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:29,805
I am fearful when I see people substituting
fear for reason. In fact, I would...

321
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:35,006
Uh, thank you, Mr. Carpenter. Thank you very
much. I see another gentleman in the crowd...

322
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:39,167
Extra! Extra! Spaceman eludes police!
Army put in charge.

323
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:42,289
Read all about it! Spaceman eludes police!

324
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,369
Extra! Extra!

325
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,530
Get your paper here. Army put in charge.

326
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:51,650
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

327
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:56,852
- You think they'll ever find him?
- I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.

328
00:33:56,853 --> 00:33:59,972
Mr. Carpenter, what is inertia?

329
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:03,094
The property of matter by which
it remains in uniform motion

330
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:06,216
unless acted upon by external force.

331
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:07,254
Oh.

332
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:11,416
I'll bet that's just the way
Professor Barnhardt talks.

333
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,498
Bobby, I have an idea.

334
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:18,697
- Let's go and find out how Barnhardt talks.
- You're kidding!

335
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:22,860
- Wouldn't you like to meet him?
- Sure I would, but I bet you'd be scared.

336
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,020
Maybe we can scare him
more than he can scare us.

337
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:30,142
I like you, Mr. Carpenter.
You're a real screwball.

338
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:36,382
Extra! Extra!
Spaceman still at large.

339
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:40,545
Extra! Read all about it.
Get your paper here.

340
00:34:50,947 --> 00:34:53,028
Maybe he isn't home.

341
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,391
Gee, I'll bet you this is where he works.

342
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:26,838
What's that stuff on the blackboard mean?

343
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,437
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

344
00:35:29,438 --> 00:35:31,518
I'll bet he's the only one
that knows the answer.

345
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,680
He doesn't know the answer.
And he'll never get it that way.

346
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:41,922
We probably couldn't get to see him
even if he was home.

347
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,202
Hey, where are you going?

348
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:53,365
If he's that difficult to see,
perhaps we ought to leave a calling card.

349
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,008
Did he do it wrong?

350
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:12,089
He just needs a little help.

351
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:28,734
What are you doing in here?

352
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:33,935
How dare you write on that blackboard!

353
00:36:33,936 --> 00:36:37,056
Do you realize the professor's
worked on that problem for weeks?

354
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:40,177
He'll solve it in no time now.

355
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:44,338
- How did you get in? What do you want?
- To see Professor Barnhardt.

356
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:47,460
Well, he's not here.
And he won't be back till this evening.

357
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:54,742
I think you'd better leave now.

358
00:37:02,024 --> 00:37:04,625
Would you give this to the professor?

359
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:07,225
I think he'll want to talk to me.

360
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:22,829
I wouldn't erase that.
The professor needs it very badly.

361
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:58,720
- Mr. Carpenter come home yet?
- Yeah, he's inside.

362
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:01,321
- Tell him I'd like to see him.
- OK. Come on in.

363
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,602
- Your name Carpenter?
- Yes.

364
00:38:08,603 --> 00:38:12,763
- Professor Barnhardt been looking for me?
- I've been looking for you all afternoon.

365
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:22,125
Thank you.

366
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:29,407
- It was a wonderful day.
- You still haven't answered my question.

367
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:35,649
You know how I feel, Tom,
but I just want to think it over.

368
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:40,851
Boss goes to Chicago tomorrow. If I could
tell him I was marrying and had dependants...

369
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:45,011
You're a good salesman,
but I've got to think about it.

370
00:38:45,012 --> 00:38:49,173
A good insurance salesman
wouldn't give you time to think about it.

371
00:38:51,254 --> 00:38:53,334
- Good night.
- Night.

372
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:03,737
- Hiya, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

373
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:06,857
- Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
- Good evening.

374
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:09,979
- Uh, Mrs. Benson, this is Mr. Brady.
- How do you do?

375
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,060
Mr. Brady's a government agent!

376
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:18,301
- Have a nice day, dear?
- We had a swell time, didn't we?

377
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:19,342
Yes.

378
00:39:19,343 --> 00:39:23,503
We went to the movies and had ice-cream
cones, and then we went to see Daddy.

379
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:27,664
- I don't know how to thank you.
- I enjoyed every minute of it.

380
00:39:28,704 --> 00:39:30,785
We better get going, Mr. Carpenter.

381
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:34,945
Aw, gee, you didn't finish your story.

382
00:39:34,946 --> 00:39:38,067
I'll finish it tomorrow. Good night, Bobby.

383
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:40,147
- Good night.
- Good night.

384
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,550
Come on, dear. Time to go to bed.

385
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:55,751
Why did Mr. Carpenter
have to go with Mr. Brady?

386
00:39:55,752 --> 00:39:57,832
I don't know. Maybe it was a mistake.

387
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,913
Oh.

388
00:40:00,954 --> 00:40:05,114
We sure had fun today. We saw the spaceship
and we went to see Professor Barnhardt.

389
00:40:05,115 --> 00:40:07,193
- Professor Barnhardt?
- Yeah, sure.

390
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:12,396
- Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
- Yes, of course, dear.

391
00:40:12,397 --> 00:40:15,517
Gee. I was hoping I could
go out with Mr. Carpenter again.

392
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,960
Oh, come in. The professor's in his study.

393
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:29,041
Thank you.

394
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:39,964
This is the man you wanted to see, Professor.

395
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:42,564
- Thank you, Captain.
- I'll wait outside.

396
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:48,807
- You wrote this?
- It was a clumsy way to introduce myself.

397
00:40:48,808 --> 00:40:51,926
But I understand you're
a difficult man to see.

398
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:57,129
- I thought you'd have the solution by now.
- Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.

399
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,249
All you have to do now is to substitute
this expression at this point.

400
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:05,451
That will reproduce the first-order term.
But what about the effect of the other terms?

401
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:09,611
Almost negligible. With variation
of parameters, this is the answer.

402
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:12,734
How can you be so sure?
Have you tested this theory?

403
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:17,934
I find it works well enough
to get me from one planet to another.

404
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:23,136
I am Klaatu.

405
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:29,378
I spent two days at your
Walter Reed Hospital, room 309.

406
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:32,499
My doctor's name was Major White.

407
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:36,661
If youre not interested or if you
intend to turn me over to your army,

408
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,740
we needn't waste any more time.

409
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:52,265
You may go now, Captain.
Please thank General Cutler,

410
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:55,385
and tell him...
tell him that I know this gentleman.

411
00:41:58,505 --> 00:41:59,545
You have faith.

412
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:03,708
It isn't faith that makes good science,
Mr. Klaatu. It's curiosity.

413
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:06,827
Sit down, please.

414
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:10,989
There are several thousand questions
I'd like to ask you.

415
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,190
- I'd like to explain something of my
mission. - That was my first question.

416
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:22,432
We know from observation that your planet
has discovered a rudimentary atomic energy.

417
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:27,633
- And that you're experimenting
with rockets. - Yes, that is true.

418
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:32,835
While you were limited to fighting among
yourselves with primitive tanks and aircraft,

419
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:34,915
we were unconcerned.

420
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:39,077
But soon one of your nations
will apply atomic energy to spaceships.

421
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:43,239
That will create a threat
to the peace and security of other planets.

422
00:42:44,278 --> 00:42:46,358
That, of course, we cannot tolerate.

423
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:49,480
What exactly is the nature
of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?

424
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:52,600
I came here to warn you
that by threatening danger,

425
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:56,762
your planet faces danger, very grave danger.

426
00:42:57,803 --> 00:43:01,963
- I'm prepared, however, to offer a solution.
- Would you care to be more specific?

427
00:43:01,964 --> 00:43:06,124
What I have to say
must be said to all concerned.

428
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,286
It is too important
to be entrusted to any individual.

429
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:19,646
I gather that your efforts on
the official level were not successful.

430
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:24,849
I come to you as a last resort,
and I confess my patience is wearing thin.

431
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:29,011
- Must I take drastic action to get a hearing?
- What... what sort of action do you mean?

432
00:43:29,012 --> 00:43:34,212
Violent action, since that seems to be
the only thing your people understand.

433
00:43:34,213 --> 00:43:38,373
Leveling New York City perhaps,
or sinking the Rock of Gibraltar.

434
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:49,816
Would you meet with the group
of scientists I'm calling together?

435
00:43:49,817 --> 00:43:55,018
You could explain your mission to them and
they, in turn, could present it to their peoples.

436
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:58,137
That's why I came to see you.

437
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:00,218
It is not enough to have men of science.

438
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:04,380
We scientists are too often
ignored or misunderstood.

439
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:08,541
We must get leaders from every field -
the finest minds in the world.

440
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:10,622
I leave that in your hands.

441
00:44:12,703 --> 00:44:14,782
One thing, Mr. Klaatu.

442
00:44:14,783 --> 00:44:19,985
Suppose this group should reject
your proposals. What is the alternative?

443
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:23,104
I'm afraid there is no alternative.

444
00:44:23,105 --> 00:44:25,187
In such a case,
the planet Earth would have to be...

445
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:28,306
eliminated.

446
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:30,387
Such power exists?

447
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:33,509
I assure you, such power exists.

448
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:39,750
The people who come to the meeting
must be made to realize this.

449
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:41,831
They must understand what is at stake.

450
00:44:43,912 --> 00:44:45,991
- You mentioned a demonstration of force.
- Yes.

451
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:50,152
- Would one be possible before the meeting?
- Yes, of course.

452
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:54,314
Something to dramatize for them and
their people the seriousness of the situation.

453
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:58,476
- Something to affect the entire planet.
- That can easily be arranged.

454
00:44:58,477 --> 00:45:01,596
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody
or destroy anything.

455
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:04,716
Leave it to me. I'll think of something.

456
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:07,839
Maybe a little demonstration.

457
00:45:08,878 --> 00:45:11,999
Something dramatic, but not destructive.

458
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,160
That's quite an interesting problem.

459
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,281
Would the day after tomorrow
be all right, say about noon?

460
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,724
There are no further developments,

461
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:35,925
but police and the FBI are tracing every
possible clue and rounding up all suspects...

462
00:45:35,926 --> 00:45:38,007
- Rummy!
- Oh, my.

463
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:39,047
Did it again!

464
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:43,208
- Take a hand, Mr. Carpenter?
- Take a...? Oh.

465
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:46,329
No, thanks. We don't... No, thanks.

466
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,010
- Are you going out, dear?
- Yes. Tom's picking me up.

467
00:45:51,011 --> 00:45:54,652
Personally, I wouldn't go out
after dark these days.

468
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:57,772
But then I'm not courting, am I?

469
00:46:01,934 --> 00:46:02,973
Oh!

470
00:46:02,974 --> 00:46:05,054
Oh, Mr. Carpenter.

471
00:46:11,295 --> 00:46:14,417
Everyone seems so...

472
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:17,537
"Jittery" is the word.

473
00:46:18,578 --> 00:46:21,699
Bobby's the only person I know
who isn't... jittery.

474
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,818
He has his homework to keep him occupied.

475
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:27,940
- He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
- Naturally, I think so.

476
00:46:27,941 --> 00:46:31,060
Warm, friendly, intelligent.

477
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:35,221
Mr. Carpenter...

478
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:39,383
This is none of my business,
but why did that man come here last night?

479
00:46:39,384 --> 00:46:42,503
They just wanted to ask me a few questions.

480
00:46:42,504 --> 00:46:46,665
Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt
in the afternoon. He wasn't in.

481
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,786
Apparently they thought
I was looking for secrets of some kind.

482
00:46:52,907 --> 00:46:54,987
Excuse me.

483
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,390
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you ready?

484
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:08,511
- In a minute.
- The picture starts at 8.50.

485
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:12,672
- I was with Mr. Carpenter.
- I hope he won't think I'm intruding.

486
00:47:12,673 --> 00:47:13,711
- Sh!
- What...

487
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:18,913
Good evening. Excuse me,
I was just going up to my room.

488
00:47:18,914 --> 00:47:22,035
- Good night, Mr. Carpenter.
- Have a good time, both of you.

489
00:47:23,076 --> 00:47:24,116
Thank you.

490
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:29,317
Why don't you wait in here while
I get my things? Tom, that was awful.

491
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:31,397
- I'm just tired of hearing
about Mr. Carpenter. - Tom!

492
00:47:31,398 --> 00:47:36,599
I don't like how he's attached himself to you
and Bobby. What do you know about him?

493
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,761
I'll go get my things.

494
00:47:55,325 --> 00:47:59,485
All you have to remember is first find
the common denominator, and then divide.

495
00:47:59,486 --> 00:48:02,607
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.

496
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,727
- I'll say good night again.
- Mr. Carpenter...

497
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:07,808
I...

498
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,970
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs. Benson.

499
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:17,170
- Bed now. You can finish that
in the morning. - OK.

500
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:23,412
Bobby.

501
00:48:24,452 --> 00:48:28,613
I think it would be better if we didn't see
quite so much of Mr. Carpenter.

502
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:32,774
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend,
and he's awful good in arithmetic.

503
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:35,895
He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

504
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:37,975
Did you really go to see Professor Barnhardt?

505
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:41,096
Sure we did. He wasn't there,
but we went to see him.

506
00:48:41,097 --> 00:48:44,218
And Mr. Carpenter showed him
how to do his arithmetic.

507
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:49,418
Mom, is something wrong
with Mr. Carpenter?

508
00:48:49,419 --> 00:48:53,060
- What do you mean, dear?
- On account of last night.

509
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:56,701
You think he's a bank robber,
or a gangster maybe?

510
00:48:56,702 --> 00:48:59,822
No, dear, of course not.
He's a very nice man.

511
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:03,983
I just think that he might prefer
to be left alone, that's all.

512
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:06,584
Now you go to bed and forget about it.

513
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:09,185
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

514
00:49:10,225 --> 00:49:12,305
Mom?

515
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:16,467
Why would he wanna be left alone?

516
00:49:17,507 --> 00:49:19,587
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

517
00:49:47,676 --> 00:49:49,756
- Bobby, have you a flashlight?
- Yeah.

518
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:55,998
- It's a real Boy Scout one.
- Fine.

519
00:49:59,118 --> 00:50:02,237
- Here. All you gotta do is push up on it.
- Oh.

520
00:50:02,238 --> 00:50:05,361
- What do you need it for?
- I've, uh... The light in my room went out.

521
00:50:05,362 --> 00:50:06,400
Oh.

522
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:11,602
I must tell you sometime about
a kind of train that doesn't need any tracks.

523
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:12,642
- Really?
- Really.

524
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,763
- Remind me in the morning to tell you.
- OK.

525
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:29,287
No tracks.

526
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:35,835
Gort! Baringa!

527
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:36,508
Come in for a minute.

528
00:56:37,549 --> 00:56:41,709
- Bobby, what are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep. I had to tell you.

529
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,830
- Tell me what?
- After you left, I followed Mr. Carpenter,

530
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:47,952
and where do you think he went?
Right into the spaceship!

531
00:56:47,953 --> 00:56:51,072
- Now, Bobby, wait a minute.
- Honest, Mom. I saw him.

532
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:56,274
It opened up and he walked in.
That big iron fella was walking around, too.

533
00:56:56,275 --> 00:56:59,394
- Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
- No, I haven't, Mom.

534
00:56:59,395 --> 00:57:02,515
Honest. I promise you, I saw him!

535
00:57:02,516 --> 00:57:05,635
- Where'd you see all this?
- On the lawn down at the Mall.

536
00:57:05,636 --> 00:57:09,798
- In that place with the soldiers out in
front. - Where were the soldiers?

537
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:12,919
That big iron guy grabbed 'em
and knocked 'em out.

538
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,038
I like Mr. Carpenter, Mom,
but I'm kinda scared.

539
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:20,201
Don't be frightened. It was only a bad
dream. Here, we'll prove it to you.

540
00:57:20,202 --> 00:57:23,321
- Tom, ask Mr. Carpenter to come down.
- Sure.

541
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:26,441
- He's in the room next to mine.
- OK.

542
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:31,644
Think back. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at
all, did you? You haven't even been outside.

543
00:57:31,645 --> 00:57:33,723
- Yes, I have!
- You didn't really see a spaceship,

544
00:57:34,765 --> 00:57:37,885
- but you thought you did.
- I'd never call you a liar.

545
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:29,899
He's not there,
but look what I found in his room.

546
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,019
- Is it real?
- It looks real to me.

547
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:37,181
Mr. Carpenter's got lots of diamonds.
He gave me a couple of 'em.

548
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,302
- He gave these to you?
- Well, not exactly.

549
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:43,423
I gave him two dollars.

550
00:58:43,424 --> 00:58:46,544
This doesn't make sense.

551
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:51,745
- I think he's a crook. I never did trust him.
- Gee, you think he's a diamond smuggler?

552
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:53,826
- You're going to bed now.
- I wonder if we...

553
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:57,987
Bobby and I have had
enough excitement for tonight.

554
00:58:57,988 --> 00:59:02,148
- Do you think it's all right to stay here?
- I've got a good lock on my door.

555
00:59:02,149 --> 00:59:06,310
Bobby's gonna sleep in my room tonight.
Come on now, up to bed with you.

556
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:08,390
Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

557
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:10,472
Yeah. The grass was kinda wet.

558
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:20,874
- I'm going now, Helen.
- All right.

559
00:59:34,397 --> 00:59:36,477
- Hello.
- May I see you for a minute?

560
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:39,599
- Well, I'm just going to lunch.
- May I walk out with you?

561
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:42,720
Well...

562
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:48,961
Mrs. Benson speaking.

563
00:59:48,962 --> 00:59:50,000
Oh, hello.

564
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:54,163
I'm getting an appraisal on that diamond.
Can we lunch together?

565
00:59:54,164 --> 00:59:56,764
Can I talk to you later?

566
00:59:56,765 --> 00:59:59,365
Oh, that'll be fine. Bye.

567
01:00:11,848 --> 01:00:14,448
I saw Bobby this morning
before he went to school.

568
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:17,049
- Yes? - I'd like to know what
he told you last night.

569
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:21,210
I really didn't pay much attention.
Bobby has such an active imagination.

570
01:00:21,211 --> 01:00:24,331
Did you believe what he told you?

571
01:00:24,332 --> 01:00:28,493
I have a reason for asking this.
A very important reason.

572
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:33,694
There's another elevator we can use.

573
01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:48,259
- What is it you want?
- Before I ask you to be honest with me,

574
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:52,418
perhaps I should be
completely honest with you.

575
01:00:52,419 --> 01:00:54,499
- What happened?
- What time is it?

576
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,660
Just 12.00.

577
01:00:58,661 --> 01:01:02,822
We shall be here for a little while.
About 30 minutes.

578
01:01:04,902 --> 01:01:08,024
- We can try pushing the other buttons.
- They won't work.

579
01:01:09,063 --> 01:01:13,225
- Why not? - You see, the
electricity's been neutralized...

580
01:01:13,226 --> 01:01:15,306
all over the world.

581
01:01:16,345 --> 01:01:19,467
Bobby was telling the truth, wasn't he?

582
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,547
Yes.

583
01:01:49,635 --> 01:01:51,715
It's that spaceman. That's what it is.

584
01:03:00,374 --> 01:03:03,495
You should see it!
You should go out and see it for yourself!

585
01:03:03,496 --> 01:03:05,575
Thanks. I am enjoying it right here.

586
01:03:05,576 --> 01:03:09,217
The city has stopped.
People are running around like ants.

587
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:12,857
What a brilliant idea.
I never would have thought of it.

588
01:03:12,859 --> 01:03:17,018
The people who are coming to
the meeting tonight, have they arrived?

589
01:03:17,019 --> 01:03:21,181
Yes. I talked to them on the phone.
They're all very curious about the meeting.

590
01:03:21,182 --> 01:03:24,301
Good. Did you speak to
our friend Mr. Carpenter?

591
01:03:24,302 --> 01:03:26,381
He'll be there at 8.30.

592
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:32,624
Tell me, Hilda, does all this frighten you?
Does it make you feel insecure?

593
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:36,785
- Yes, sir. It certainly does.
- That's good, Hilda.

594
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:38,865
I'm glad.

595
01:03:39,906 --> 01:03:44,065
As far as we can tell, power's been cut off
everywhere, with a few exceptions.

596
01:03:44,066 --> 01:03:49,267
And even these exceptions are remarkable -
hospitals, planes in flight, that sort of thing.

597
01:03:49,268 --> 01:03:53,429
I wish I could tell you more but,
as you know, all communications are out -

598
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,549
telephones, radio, cable, everything.

599
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:03,832
I can tell you the president is prepared
to declare a state of national emergency.

600
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:17,356
- Eleanor, did you call the electrician?
- I tried, but the phone doesn't work either.

601
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:21,516
- Well, call the phone company.
- But the phone doesn't work!

602
01:04:24,638 --> 01:04:28,278
- Is it worth anything? - I have never
seen such a stone in all my life.

603
01:04:28,279 --> 01:04:32,180
- Will you tell me where it came from?
- That's what I want you to tell me.

604
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:36,080
But there are no diamonds like this
anyplace in the world that I know of.

605
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:39,202
- Are you sure of that?
- Uh, would you like to sell it?

606
01:04:39,203 --> 01:04:42,322
No. No, thanks.

607
01:04:42,323 --> 01:04:45,443
- I'd give you a very good price.
- Thank you, no.

608
01:04:47,523 --> 01:04:52,725
I've told you more than I told Barnhardt
because, in a sense, my life is in your hands.

609
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:58,968
I thought if you knew the facts, you'd see
the importance of the meeting tonight.

610
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:02,088
Of course. Of course I do.

611
01:05:03,127 --> 01:05:07,289
- You hold great hope for this meeting.
- I can see no other hope for your planet.

612
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:11,450
If this meeting should fail,
then I'm afraid there is no hope.

613
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,612
It must be 12.30.

614
01:05:17,692 --> 01:05:18,733
Yes.

615
01:05:19,772 --> 01:05:21,854
Just exactly.

616
01:05:42,659 --> 01:05:44,738
- Where are you going now?
- The boarding house.

617
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:48,901
I'll be safe there for today. I can watch Bobby.
He's the only other person who knows...

618
01:05:49,941 --> 01:05:52,020
- No, wait. There's someone else.
- Who?

619
01:05:52,021 --> 01:05:55,142
Tom. He was there last night
when Bobby told me what he saw.

620
01:05:55,143 --> 01:06:00,344
- Do you think he'd tell anyone?
- I think he'd talk to me first anyway, before...

621
01:06:01,385 --> 01:06:06,585
Well, we can't take any chance. I'll get
in touch with him right away to make sure.

622
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:12,828
But I've got to talk to him. It's important.
When is he coming back?

623
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:14,907
I don't know, Mrs. Benson.

624
01:06:14,908 --> 01:06:18,029
He left before noon,
before that awful electric business.

625
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:21,149
I'm scared to death, Mrs. Benson. I...

626
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:25,312
No, he wouldn't tell me where he was going.
He said it was something personal.

627
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:28,432
Well, please ask him to call me
the minute he gets in.

628
01:06:28,433 --> 01:06:30,512
Thanks.

629
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:38,834
Before we discuss plans, I want a report
from Colonel Ryder. What about the robot?

630
01:06:38,835 --> 01:06:40,915
When it was discovered
that the robot had moved,

631
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:46,116
I was directed by the Joint Chiefs
to find a means of immobilizing him.

632
01:06:46,117 --> 01:06:50,278
We accomplished that this morning
by encasing him in a block of KL93,

633
01:06:50,279 --> 01:06:52,358
a new plastic material stronger than steel.

634
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:56,519
- Isn't it possible he's broken out?
- No, sir. We just checked on that.

635
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,680
- He's locked up tight as a drum.
- All right. Now we concentrate on the man.

636
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:04,841
Up till now we've agreed upon
the desirability of capturing this man alive.

637
01:07:04,842 --> 01:07:07,962
We can no longer afford to be so particular.

638
01:07:07,963 --> 01:07:11,084
We'll get him, alive if possible,
but we must get him.

639
01:07:12,124 --> 01:07:14,205
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

640
01:07:50,615 --> 01:07:52,693
Honest, Mary, I'm so
scared I can't sit still.

641
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:57,896
I'd like to run someplace,
but I don't know where to go. Bye now.

642
01:07:57,897 --> 01:08:02,579
Margaret, call the Pentagon. Find out
who's in charge of this spaceman business.

643
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:07,258
- Whoever it is, I wanna talk to him.
- Mrs. Benson called. She says it's important.

644
01:08:07,259 --> 01:08:09,339
Get this other call first.

645
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:16,621
- Oh, Mrs. Benson, he just walked in.
- Fine.

646
01:08:16,622 --> 01:08:18,702
- Are you nervous, too?
- Yes, I am.

647
01:08:18,703 --> 01:08:22,864
- Helen, come on in.
- I've been trying to get you all afternoon.

648
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,985
I have some terrific news
about Mr. Carpenter.

649
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:29,104
- What about him?
- He's the spaceman.

650
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:33,266
I had that diamond checked at three places.
Nobody's ever seen a stone like that.

651
01:08:33,267 --> 01:08:36,386
After what Bobby told us,
that's enough for me.

652
01:08:36,387 --> 01:08:39,508
Why is it nobody knows about him?
Why hasn't he got money?

653
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:42,628
All right, Tom, it's true. I know it's true.

654
01:08:42,629 --> 01:08:45,749
- You... How do you know?
- Never mind about that.

655
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,391
- Promise you won't say a word to anybody.
- After what happened today?!

656
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:53,031
- You don't realize how important this is.
- Of course it's important.

657
01:08:53,032 --> 01:08:58,233
- And we can do something about it.
- That's what I'm saying. We must do nothing.

658
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:01,354
- Believe me. - He's a menace.
It's our duty to turn him in.

659
01:09:01,355 --> 01:09:04,475
But he isn't a menace.
He told me why he came here.

660
01:09:05,515 --> 01:09:07,595
He told... He told you?

661
01:09:07,596 --> 01:09:11,757
Oh, don't be silly, honey,
just because you like the guy.

662
01:09:11,758 --> 01:09:13,836
You realize what this'd mean to us?

663
01:09:13,837 --> 01:09:19,039
- I'd be the biggest man in the country.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

664
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,120
Somebody has to get rid of him.

665
01:09:21,121 --> 01:09:22,158
I won't let you do it.

666
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,240
- Yes?
- This is important...

667
01:09:24,241 --> 01:09:29,441
What's his name, Margaret?
General Cutler. Yes. Oh, all right, I'll hold on.

668
01:09:29,442 --> 01:09:33,603
You mustn't. It isnt just you and Mr.
Carpenter. The rest of the world is involved.

669
01:09:33,604 --> 01:09:36,724
I don't care about the rest of the world.

670
01:09:38,805 --> 01:09:41,924
You'll feel different
when you see my picture in the papers.

671
01:09:41,925 --> 01:09:46,086
- I feel different now.
- You wait. You're gonna marry a big hero.

672
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:50,247
- I'm not going to marry anybody.
- Helen, I... Hello, General Cutler?

673
01:09:50,248 --> 01:09:54,409
No, I don't want to speak to his aide.
I want to speak to the general.

674
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:56,490
Tell him it's about the spaceman.

675
01:10:05,852 --> 01:10:07,932
That's right. That's where he's staying.

676
01:10:07,933 --> 01:10:11,053
- Yes, of course I'm sure.
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

677
01:10:11,054 --> 01:10:14,694
I'll want to talk to you further,
but I haven't time now.

678
01:10:14,695 --> 01:10:18,335
Deploy all Zone Five units
according to Plan B. Immediately!

679
01:11:06,188 --> 01:11:08,269
- Hello, Mrs. Benson.
- Hello, Sammy.

680
01:11:17,632 --> 01:11:20,752
Attention, all units. Attention, all units.

681
01:11:20,753 --> 01:11:23,872
When deployed according to Plan Baker,

682
01:11:23,874 --> 01:11:28,034
maintain station and remain on radio alert
until further orders.

683
01:12:19,008 --> 01:12:22,129
I'm sure Barnhardt can hide me
until the meeting.

684
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:25,251
- Where's the meeting going to be?
- At the ship.

685
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:30,452
Yeah, they got in a taxicab
and went off down that street.

686
01:12:30,453 --> 01:12:32,532
Thank you, son.

687
01:12:34,612 --> 01:12:37,733
Attention, Zone Five. Attention, Zone Five.

688
01:12:37,734 --> 01:12:41,375
Yellow cab moving north
on 14th Street from Harvard Street.

689
01:12:41,376 --> 01:12:45,017
Man and woman in back seat.
Get license number and report.

690
01:12:54,378 --> 01:12:55,419
That's the one!

691
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:05,821
Right. Attention, Zone Five.
License number of target vehicle is H0012.

692
01:13:05,822 --> 01:13:08,942
Hey. Looks like something big's going on.

693
01:13:19,346 --> 01:13:24,547
Attention, Zone Five. Report when
target vehicle passes your position.

694
01:13:41,191 --> 01:13:44,832
- It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
- I'm worried about Gort.

695
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:48,473
I'm afraid of what he might do
if anything should happen to me.

696
01:13:48,474 --> 01:13:52,634
Gort? But he's a robot.
Without you, what could he do?

697
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:54,715
There's no limit to what he could do.

698
01:13:54,716 --> 01:13:56,796
He could destroy the Earth.

699
01:13:59,916 --> 01:14:03,037
If anything should happen to me,
you must go to Gort.

700
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:05,118
You must say these words:

701
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:08,238
Klaatu barada nikto.

702
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:11,360
Please repeat that.

703
01:14:11,361 --> 01:14:13,441
Klaatu...

704
01:14:14,481 --> 01:14:16,560
barada nikto.

705
01:14:16,561 --> 01:14:18,642
You must remember those words.

706
01:14:20,723 --> 01:14:22,803
Klaatu

707
01:14:22,804 --> 01:14:24,363
barada

708
01:14:24,364 --> 01:14:25,924
nikto.

709
01:14:29,045 --> 01:14:34,246
Yellow cab, license number H0012, heading
west on 15th Street at Treasury Place.

710
01:14:40,488 --> 01:14:44,649
The target vehicle is turning west
into Massachusetts Avenue.

711
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,850
Yellow cab at
Columbia Road and Connecticut.

712
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:52,972
Repeat, Columbia Road and Connecticut.

713
01:14:54,012 --> 01:14:57,132
Attention, all units,
northwest area, Zone Five.

714
01:14:58,173 --> 01:15:03,374
Block off all streets intersecting Connecticut
Avenue on a line from Wisconsin to the park.

715
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,455
All vehicles close in.

716
01:15:06,494 --> 01:15:08,576
Let's go.

717
01:15:44,986 --> 01:15:47,066
Say, what's going on here?

718
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:51,227
Drive...

719
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:08,913
Get that message to Gort... right away.

720
01:16:31,799 --> 01:16:34,918
- Captain, hold these people back.
- Yes, sir.

721
01:16:34,919 --> 01:16:39,081
See if they have a stretcher
at the police station. Take him there.

722
01:19:23,446 --> 01:19:24,485
Gort.

723
01:19:24,486 --> 01:19:28,648
Klaatu barada nikto.

724
01:19:29,687 --> 01:19:32,808
Klaatu barada nikto.

725
01:21:44,925 --> 01:21:49,086
Yes, sir. Yes, we have the body
here now, locked in a cell.

726
01:21:50,126 --> 01:21:53,248
There's no question about it, General.
He's dead all right.

727
01:21:53,249 --> 01:21:57,408
I understand. I'll be right there, sir.

728
01:21:57,409 --> 01:22:00,530
Bring in a squad of men.
Place a guard around that cell.

729
01:22:00,531 --> 01:22:03,650
- Captain, don't let anyone in
or out of here. - Yes, sir.

730
01:22:03,651 --> 01:22:05,730
Come along.

731
01:24:07,444 --> 01:24:09,524
- Professor Barnhardt?
- Yes.

732
01:24:09,525 --> 01:24:12,646
I'm very sorry, but I have to ask you
to call off this meeting.

733
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:14,727
Call it off?
But I had permission from the army.

734
01:24:15,767 --> 01:24:20,968
I know, sir, but the robot's on the loose, and
it's not safe. You have to get your people out.

735
01:25:55,635 --> 01:25:57,714
Hello.

736
01:25:57,716 --> 01:25:59,794
I...

737
01:25:59,795 --> 01:26:01,876
I thought you were...

738
01:26:01,877 --> 01:26:03,957
I was.

739
01:26:06,037 --> 01:26:08,118
You mean...

740
01:26:09,158 --> 01:26:11,238
he has the power of life and death?

741
01:26:11,239 --> 01:26:15,399
No. That power is reserved
to the Almighty Spirit.

742
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,561
This technique, in some cases,
can restore life for a limited period.

743
01:26:19,562 --> 01:26:21,640
But... how long?

744
01:26:21,641 --> 01:26:23,722
You mean, how long will I live?

745
01:26:23,723 --> 01:26:26,843
That, no one can tell.

746
01:26:40,366 --> 01:26:46,608
Under the circumstances,
the army people have asked us to leave.

747
01:26:46,609 --> 01:26:50,770
And, since their concern is for our safety,

748
01:26:50,771 --> 01:26:54,931
I can do nothing but suggest that we comply.

749
01:27:28,219 --> 01:27:32,381
I am leaving soon,
and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly.

750
01:27:34,462 --> 01:27:37,582
The universe grows smaller every day,

751
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:42,783
and the threat of aggression by any group
anywhere can no longer be tolerated.

752
01:27:44,864 --> 01:27:49,026
There must be security for all,
or no one is secure.

753
01:27:50,066 --> 01:27:55,267
This does not mean giving up any freedom,
except the freedom to act irresponsibly.

754
01:27:57,348 --> 01:28:01,510
Your ancestors knew this
when they made laws to govern themselves,

755
01:28:01,511 --> 01:28:04,629
and hired policemen to enforce them.

756
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:08,790
We of the other planets
have long accepted this principle.

757
01:28:08,791 --> 01:28:13,992
We have an organization for
the mutual protection of all planets,

758
01:28:13,993 --> 01:28:17,112
and for the complete
elimination of aggression.

759
01:28:17,113 --> 01:28:23,355
The test of any such higher authority
is, of course, the police force that supports it.

760
01:28:23,356 --> 01:28:27,516
For our policemen,
we created a race of robots.

761
01:28:28,557 --> 01:28:33,758
Their function is to patrol the planets
in spaceships like this one,

762
01:28:33,759 --> 01:28:35,838
and preserve the peace.

763
01:28:35,839 --> 01:28:41,040
In matters of aggression
we have given them absolute power over us.

764
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:44,160
This power cannot be revoked.

765
01:28:44,161 --> 01:28:49,362
At the first sign of violence,
they act automatically against the aggressor.

766
01:28:49,363 --> 01:28:54,564
The penalty for provoking their action
is too terrible to risk.

767
01:28:55,604 --> 01:28:57,685
The result is, we live in peace,

768
01:28:58,725 --> 01:29:00,804
without arms or armies,

769
01:29:00,805 --> 01:29:03,926
secure in the knowledge that
we are free from aggression and war,

770
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:07,048
free to pursue more profitable enterprises.

771
01:29:09,127 --> 01:29:12,249
We do not pretend
to have achieved perfection,

772
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:16,410
but we do have a system, and it works.

773
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:20,570
I came here to give you these facts.

774
01:29:21,612 --> 01:29:24,732
It is no concern of ours
how you run your own planet.

775
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:28,891
But if you threaten to extend your violence,

776
01:29:28,892 --> 01:29:33,054
this Earth of yours
will be reduced to a burned-out cinder.

777
01:29:35,135 --> 01:29:38,256
Your choice is simple.

778
01:29:38,257 --> 01:29:41,376
Join us and live in peace,

779
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:44,497
or pursue your present course
and face obliteration.

780
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:49,699
We shall be waiting for your answer.

781
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,819
The decision rests with you.
