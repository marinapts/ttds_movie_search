2
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,119
What do we care if we were expelled
from college?

3
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:56,219
The war is gonna start any day.
We would've left college anyhow.

4
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:58,025
War! lsn't it exciting, Scarlett?

5
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:00,089
Do you know those Yankees
actually want a war?

6
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,362
-We'll show 'em.
-Fiddle-dee-dee!

7
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:03,696
War, war, war!

8
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,804
This war talk's spoiling all the fun
at every party this spring.

9
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:09,171
I get so bored I could scream!

10
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,706
-Besides, there isn't going to be any war.
-Not gonna be any war?

11
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,179
Why, honey, of course
there's going to be a war!

12
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:19,275
If either of you says "war" just once again,
I'll go in the house and slam the door.

13
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:22,447
-But, Scarlett, honey--
-Don't you want us to have a war?

14
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:29,488
Well...

15
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:31,992
...but remember...

16
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:33,694
...l warned you.

17
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,467
I've got an idea.

18
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,003
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue
at Twelve Oaks.

19
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,801
That's a good idea.
Aren't you eating barbecue with us?

20
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,002
I hadn't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.

21
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:45,339
We want all your waltzes.

22
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,937
First Brent, then me, then Brent,
then me again and so on.

23
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,016
-Promise?
-I'd just love to.

24
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:54,611
If only I didn't have
every one of them taken already.

25
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,417
Why, honey, you can't do that to us.

26
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,152
-How about if we tell you a secret?
-A secret? Who about?

27
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:00,989
Do you know Miss Melanie Hamilton
from Atlanta?

28
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:03,655
Ashley Wilkes' cousin.
She's visiting the Wilkes'--

29
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,665
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know a secret about her?

30
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,360
Anyway, we heard, that is, they say--

31
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:12,462
-Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.
-The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.

32
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,234
Now do we get those waltzes?

33
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:15,805
Of course.

34
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,942
-I'll bet the other boys will be hopping mad.
-Let 'em be mad. We two can handle 'em!

35
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,778
It can't be true. Ashley loves me!

36
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,010
Scarlett!

37
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,046
What has gotten into her?

38
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,883
Do you suppose we made her mad?

39
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:33,051
Where're you goin' without your shawl,
and the night air fixin' to set in?

40
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:35,686
How come you didn't ask them gentlemen
to stay for supper?

41
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,730
You ain't got no more manners
than a field hand...

42
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,925
...after me and Miss Ellen done labored
with you.

43
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,491
Miss Scarlett, come on in the house!

44
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:44,900
Come on in before you catch
your death of dampness.

45
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:47,633
No! I'll wait for Pa to come home
from the Wilkes'.

46
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:49,299
Come on in here!

47
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,343
Come on!

48
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:07,755
Quittin' time!

49
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,293
Who says it's quittin' time?

50
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:10,522
I says it's quittin' time.

51
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:13,998
I's the foreman. I's the one that says
when it's quittin' time at Tara!

52
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,659
Quittin' time!

53
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:18,037
Quittin' time!

54
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:02,244
There's none in the county can touch you,
and none in the state.

55
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:04,641
Pa!

56
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,249
So it's proud of yourself, you are.

57
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,321
Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara!

58
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:14,827
So, you've been spying on me,
and like your sister, Suellen...

59
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:17,159
...you'll tell your mother
I was jumping again.

60
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,563
Pa, you know I'm no tattletale like Suellen,
but it does seem to me...

61
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:23,467
...after you broke your knee last year
jumping that same fence--

62
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:28,031
I'll not have me own daughter tellin' me
what I shall jump and not jump.

63
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:29,632
It's my own neck, so it is.

64
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:33,644
All right, Pa, you jump what you please.
How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?

65
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:34,737
The Wilkeses?

66
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:38,910
Just as you'd expect with the barbecue
tomorrow and talking nothing but war.

67
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,749
Oh, bother the war.
Was there anyone else there?

68
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:45,188
Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton,
from Atlanta and her brother, Charles.

69
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,623
Melanie Hamilton!

70
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:48,888
She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny.
I hate her.

71
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:50,486
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.

72
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:53,624
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.

73
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,534
What's your interest in Ashley
and Miss Melanie?

74
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:59,999
It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.

75
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:03,236
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?

76
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,743
-No!
-No, nor will he.

77
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:08,042
I have it in strictest confidence
from John Wilkes this afternoon...

78
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,809
...Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.

79
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:12,443
It will be announced tomorrow night
at the ball.

80
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,509
I don't believe it.

81
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:16,815
Here! Here! Where are you off to?

82
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,046
Scarlett!

83
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:20,823
What are you about?

84
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:24,025
Have you made a spectacle of yourself
running after a man...

85
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:27,191
...who's not in love with you when
you might have any man in the county?

86
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:30,803
I haven't been running after him.
It's just a surprise, that's all.

87
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,703
Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.

88
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:37,209
If Ashley wanted to marry you,
it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes".

89
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:40,836
I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.

90
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:42,244
I would, I would!

91
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,179
What difference does it make
who you marry...

92
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,742
...so long as he's a Southerner
and thinks like you?

93
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,186
And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.

94
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:51,724
I don't want Tara.
Plantations don't mean anything when--

95
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:56,490
You mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,
that land doesn't mean anything to you?

96
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:59,191
Why, land is the only thing in the world
worth working for...

97
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:03,032
...worth fighting for, worth dying for,
because it's the only thing that lasts.

98
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:06,763
-Oh, Pa, you talk like an lrishman.
-It's proud I am that I'm lrish.

99
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,401
And don't you be forgetting, Missy,
that you're half lrish too.

100
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:12,877
And to anyone with a drop of lrish blood
in them...

101
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:15,176
...why, the land they live on
is like their mother.

102
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:19,810
Oh, but you're just a child.
It'll come to you, this love of the land.

103
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:22,252
There's no getting away from it
if you're lrish.

104
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,204
Yonder she comes!

105
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,079
Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,
your ma's home!

106
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:54,018
Actin' like a wet nurse
to them low-down, poor white trash...

107
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,612
...instead of bein' here eatin' her supper.
Cookie, stir up the fire!

108
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:00,182
Miss Ellen's got no business
wearin' herself out.

109
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:03,195
Take the lamp out on the porch!
Wearin' herself out.

110
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,527
Mist' Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.

111
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,758
Wearin' herself out
waitin' on the poor white trash.

112
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,995
Shut up, dogs!
Barkin' in the house like that.

113
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,664
Get up from there. Don't you hear
that Miss Ellen's comin'?

114
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:15,071
Get out there and get her medicine chest.

115
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:17,773
We was gettin' worried about you,
Miss Ellen.

116
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:20,472
-Mist' Gerald--
-All right, Pork. I'm home.

117
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:24,577
Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing
the creek bottom today.

118
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:27,245
What do you want me
to start on tomorrow?

119
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,051
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come
from Emmy Slattery's bedside.

120
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:32,749
Your child has been born.

121
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:36,090
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.

122
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:38,594
Has been born and, mercifully, has died.

123
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:41,127
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkerson.

124
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,798
I'll fix your supper for you myself,
and you eats it.

125
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:48,101
After prayers, Mammy.

126
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:49,300
Yes, ma'am.

127
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,841
Mr. O'Hara.

128
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:54,039
You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.

129
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:57,606
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.

130
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,810
He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.

131
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:00,978
But....

132
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:03,547
-No!
-Yes.

133
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,688
The Yankee Wilkerson
and the white-trash Slattery girl!

134
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,729
We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.

135
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,057
Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.

136
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:18,398
I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!

137
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,167
I don't like your tone, Suellen.
Your pink gown is lovely.

138
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:24,768
-Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?
-But you may wear my garnets with it.

139
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:27,438
Why can't I stay up for the ball
tomorrow night?

140
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,275
Scarlett...

141
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:31,909
...you look tired, my dear.
I'm worried about you.

142
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:34,150
I'm all right, Mother.

143
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:36,688
Why can't I stay up for the ball
tomorrow night?

144
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:38,121
I'm 13 now.

145
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:40,522
You may go to the barbecue
and stay up through supper.

146
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:42,823
I didn't want to wear
your tacky green dress anyhow, stingy!

147
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:43,828
Oh, hush up!

148
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:45,387
Prayers, girls.

149
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:57,166
"And to all the saints, that I have sinned
exceedingly in thought, word and deed...

150
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,707
"...through my fault.

151
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:02,075
"Through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

152
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:05,882
"Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary,
ever Virgin...

153
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,283
"...Blessed Michael, the Archangel...

154
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:10,355
"...Blessed John the Baptist...

155
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,687
"...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...

156
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,351
"...and all the saints
to pray to the Lord, our God, for me."

157
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,522
But Ashley doesn't know I love him!

158
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:23,395
I'll tell him that I love him
and then he can't marry her!

159
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:27,699
"May the Almighty,
and most merciful Lord...

160
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:29,708
"...grant us pardon, absolution...

161
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,905
"...and remission of our sins. Amen."

162
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:36,745
Just hold on and suck in.

163
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,081
Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.

164
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,754
You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.

165
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:44,414
Oh, yes, ma'am, you is!

166
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:46,855
You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.

167
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:49,886
No, I'm not!

168
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:54,691
Put on the dress,
because we're late already.

169
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,667
-What's my lamb gonna wear?
-That.

170
00:15:56,736 --> 00:16:00,763
No you ain't! You can't show your bosom
before three o'clock.

171
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:02,805
I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!

172
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:06,243
If you say one word to Mother,
I won't eat a bite!

173
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,407
Well....

174
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:21,290
Keep your shawl on.
I ain't aimin' for you to get all freckled...

175
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:25,491
...after the buttermilk I done put on you
all this winter, bleachin' them freckles.

176
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:35,707
Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on
and be good, and eat just a little, honey.

177
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:36,833
No.

178
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:40,943
I'm going to have a good time today
and do my eating at the barbecue.

179
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,944
If you don't care what folks says
about this family, I does!

180
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:47,282
I has told you and told you
that you can always tell a lady...

181
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:49,548
...by the way she eats with folks.
Like a bird!

182
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:51,681
I ain't aimin' for you to go after
Mr. Wilkes...

183
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:53,953
...and eat like a field hand
and gobble like a hog!

184
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:55,358
Fiddle-dee-dee!

185
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:59,162
Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl
with a healthy appetite.

186
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:02,166
What gentlemen says and what they thinks
is two different things.

187
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:06,001
And I ain't noticed Mist' Ashley
askin' to marry you!

188
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:25,323
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need
of havin' it come right back up again.

189
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,795
Why does a girl have to be so silly
to catch a husband?

190
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:36,093
Scarlett, ifyou're not here by the time
I count ten, we'll be goin' without you!

191
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,327
I'm coming, Pa!

192
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:38,561
One...

193
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:40,265
...two, three...

194
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:43,033
...four, five, six....

195
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:45,203
Oh, dear!

196
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:49,176
My stays are so tight I know I'll never get
through the day without belching.

197
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,806
Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day
you'll be having for the barbecue.

198
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:20,980
So it seems, Gerald.
But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?

199
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:23,106
She's after settling accounts
with the overseer.

200
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:24,877
But she'll be along for the ball tonight.

201
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:26,782
Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.

202
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,878
Thank you kindly, lndia.

203
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:31,651
Your daughter's getting prettier every day,
John.

204
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,183
India, here are the O'Hara girls.
We must greet them.

205
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:38,458
I can't stand Scarlett. If you saw
the way she throws herself at Ashley.

206
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,589
Now, that's your brother's business.

207
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,295
You must remember your duties
as hostess.

208
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:44,631
Good morning, girls.

209
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:47,799
Good morning, Scarlett.

210
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,999
Why, lndia Wilkes, what a lovely dress!

211
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:54,308
-Perfectly lovely, darling.
-I just can't take my eyes off it.

212
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:57,307
Scarlett, honey....

213
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,374
You're looking mighty fine this morning.

214
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,750
-Good morning, Miss Scarlett.
-Good morning.

215
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:04,380
-It's a pleasure to see you.
-Good morning.

216
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:05,685
Howdy, Miss Scarlett.

217
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:08,350
Ashley!

218
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,321
Scarlett, my dear.

219
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,960
I've been looking for you everywhere.

220
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:18,003
I've got something I must tell you.

221
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:21,663
-Can't we go some place where it's quiet?
-Yes, I'd like to, but l...

222
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:23,865
...l have something to tell you too.

223
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,707
Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.

224
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,980
But come say hello
to my cousin, Melanie, first.

225
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,641
Oh, do we have to?

226
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,784
She's been looking forward
to seeing you again.

227
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:35,978
Melanie!

228
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:38,647
Here's Scarlett.

229
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,092
Scarlett!

230
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:43,288
I'm so glad to see you again.

231
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:46,455
Melanie Hamilton!
What a surprise to run into you here.

232
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,759
I hope you'll stay with us
a few days at least.

233
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:52,362
I hope I shall stay long enough for us
to become real friends, Scarlett.

234
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:53,972
I do so want us to be.

235
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,940
We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?

236
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:58,476
We'll just have to make the biggest fuss
over her, won't we?

237
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:01,513
If there's anybody knows how to give a girl
a good time, it's Ashley.

238
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:04,812
Though I expect our good times will seem
silly to you because you're so serious.

239
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,580
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.

240
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,377
I've always admired you so.

241
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:11,082
I wish I could be more like you.

242
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:14,092
You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,
and say things you don't mean.

243
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,618
Nobody could accuse Melanie
of being insincere. Could they, my dear?

244
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:20,223
Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?

245
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,699
Ashley never means a word he says
to any girl.

246
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:26,761
Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,
you handsome old thing, you!

247
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,431
But, oh, Miss O'Hara, l....

248
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:30,772
Was it kind to bring
your good-looking brother here...

249
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:33,311
...just to break my poor, simple,
country-girl's heart?

250
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,604
She never even noticed Charles before.

251
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:37,945
Because he's your beau,
she's after him like a hornet.

252
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:40,577
Charles Hamilton,
I want to eat barbecue with you.

253
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:44,350
Mind you, don't go philandering with
any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.

254
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:45,822
I won't, Miss O'Hara!

255
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,554
I couldn't!

256
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,756
I do declare, Frank Kennedy,
if you don't look dashing...

257
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,161
...with that new set of whiskers!

258
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:54,722
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

259
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:57,932
Charles and Rafe asked me
to eat barbecue with them...

260
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,232
...but I told them I couldn't
because I promised you.

261
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:03,901
You needn't be so amused. Look at her!
She's after your beau now!

262
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,108
Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,
Miss Scarlett.

263
00:21:07,647 --> 00:21:09,638
I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.

264
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:12,543
What's your sister so mad about?
You sparkin' her beau?

265
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,745
As if I couldn't get a better beau
than that old maid in britches.

266
00:21:15,822 --> 00:21:19,155
Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome
old things, you! No, you're not!

267
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:20,749
I won't say that. I'm mad at you!

268
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:21,851
What have we done?

269
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,123
You haven't been near me all day.
I wore this old dress...

270
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:25,562
...'cause I thought you liked it.

271
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,599
I was counting on eating barbecue
with you two.

272
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,931
-Well, you are, Scarlett.
-Of course, you are.

273
00:21:30,102 --> 00:21:34,038
Oh, I never can make up my mind
which of you two is the handsomer.

274
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:37,536
I was awake all last night trying
to figure it out.

275
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:44,844
Cathleen, who's that?

276
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:45,951
Who?

277
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:48,043
That man looking at us and smiling.

278
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:49,615
The nasty, dark one.

279
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:53,749
My dear, don't you know?
That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.

280
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:55,953
He has the most terrible reputation.

281
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,031
He looks as if, as if he knows
what I look like without my shimmy!

282
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,161
Scarlett!

283
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:07,335
Why, my dear, he isn't received!

284
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:09,265
He spends a lot of time up North...

285
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:11,867
...because his folks in Charleston
won't even speak to him.

286
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:14,276
He was expelled from West Point,
he's so fast.

287
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:17,612
And then there's that business
about that girl he wouldn't marry.

288
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:18,707
Tell, tell!

289
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:23,117
Well, he took her out buggy riding
in the late afternoon without a chaperon!

290
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:26,180
And then he refused to marry her!

291
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:32,389
No, but she was ruined just the same.

292
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:39,661
Ashley!

293
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:40,931
Happy?

294
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,029
So happy!

295
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:45,903
You seem to belong here...

296
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,779
...as if it had all been imagined for you.

297
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:52,582
I like to feel that I belong
to the things you love.

298
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:54,244
You love Twelve Oaks as I do.

299
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,378
Yes, Ashley.

300
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,278
I love it as...

301
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:58,880
...as more than a house.

302
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:03,518
It's a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful.

303
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:05,824
It's so unaware that it may not last...

304
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:07,657
...forever.

305
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,998
You're afraid of what may happen
if the war comes, aren't you?

306
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,731
But we don't have to be afraid for us.

307
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:16,775
No war can come into our world, Ashley.

308
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:19,074
Whatever comes...

309
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:22,509
...l'll love you, just as I do now...

310
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:24,408
...until I die.

311
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:31,251
Isn't this better than sitting at a table?

312
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:33,792
A girl hasn't got but two sides to her
at a table.

313
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:36,286
I'll go get her dessert.

314
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:38,762
-Here, she said me.
-Allow me, Miss O'Hara.

315
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,194
I think....

316
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:48,302
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.

317
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:51,570
Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!

318
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,339
Thank you.

319
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:54,705
Go get it.

320
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,007
Isn't he the luckiest...?

321
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:05,347
Miss O'Hara...

322
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:07,881
...l love you.

323
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:11,895
I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.

324
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:18,099
Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.

325
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:20,703
Well-brought-up young ladies
take naps at parties.

326
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:24,709
And it's high time you started behavin' and
actin' like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.

327
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:28,213
When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice
any Yankee girls taking naps.

328
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,148
No, and you ain't gonna see
no Yankee girls at the ball tonight neither.

329
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:33,910
How was Ashley today, Scarlett?

330
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,580
He didn't seem to be paying
much attention to you.

331
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,451
You mind your own business!

332
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:40,886
You'll be lucky not to lose
ol' whisker-face Kennedy.

333
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,257
You've liked Ashley for months!

334
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,762
His engagement's gonna be announced
tonight. Pa said so this morning.

335
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,990
That's all you know.

336
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,830
Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!
You all behave yourselves.

337
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,629
Actin' like poor, white-trash children!

338
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:54,673
If you's old enough to go to parties,
you's old enough to act like ladies.

339
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,866
Who cares!

340
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:49,751
We've borne enough insults
from the meddling Yankees.

341
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:52,593
It's time we made them understand
we'll keep our slaves...

342
00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,098
...with or without their approval.

343
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,964
'Twas the sovereign right of the
state of Georgia to secede from the Union!

344
00:25:57,036 --> 00:25:57,968
That's right!

345
00:25:58,037 --> 00:26:00,631
The South must assert herself
by force of arms.

346
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:05,237
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals
at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!

347
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:07,777
-There's no other way!
-Fight! That's right. Fight!

348
00:26:07,847 --> 00:26:09,576
Let the Yankees ask for peace!

349
00:26:09,648 --> 00:26:13,277
The situation is very simple.
The Yankees can't fight and we can.

350
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,753
There won't even be a battle.

351
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:17,448
They'll just turn and run every time.

352
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:19,320
One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.

353
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:21,325
We'll finish them in one battle.

354
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:23,327
Gentlemen can always fight better
than rabble.

355
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,727
Yes, gentlemen always can fight better
than rabble.

356
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:28,026
What does the captain of our troop say?

357
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,636
Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights
I go with her.

358
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:35,904
But, like my father, I hope that the Yankees
will let us leave the Union in peace.

359
00:26:35,975 --> 00:26:37,602
-But, Ashley....
-But, Ashley, they've insulted us!

360
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:39,576
You can't mean you don't want war!

361
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:43,081
Most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars.

362
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:47,208
And when the wars were over
no one ever knew what they were about.

363
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:48,753
If it wasn't that I knew you--

364
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:52,848
Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been
up North, I hear.

365
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:55,051
Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?

366
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:58,154
I think it's hard winning a war with words,
gentlemen.

367
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,629
What do you mean, sir?

368
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:02,598
There's not a cannon factory
in the whole South.

369
00:27:02,668 --> 00:27:04,602
What difference does that make
to a gentleman?

370
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,901
It'll make a great deal of difference
to a great many gentlemen, sir.

371
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:10,806
Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,
that the Yankees can lick us?

372
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,070
No, I'm not hinting.

373
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:15,204
I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees
are better equipped than we.

374
00:27:15,281 --> 00:27:17,579
They've got factories, shipyards,
coal mines...

375
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,483
...and a fleet to bottle up our harbors
and starve us to death.

376
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:23,886
All we've got is cotton and slaves
and arrogance.

377
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,616
-That's Yankee treachery!
-Sir, I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!

378
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:29,250
I'm sorry if the truth offends you.

379
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,626
Apologies aren't enough, sir!

380
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:34,595
I hear you were turned out of West Point,
Mr. Rhett Butler...

381
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:38,899
...and you aren't received by any decent
family in Charleston, not even your own!

382
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:46,311
I apologize again for all my shortcomings.

383
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,843
Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about
and look over your place.

384
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,215
I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy
and cigars and...

385
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:56,118
...dreams of victory.

386
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:06,622
That'sjust about what you could expect
from somebody like Rhett Butler.

387
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:08,496
You did everything but call him out.

388
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:09,727
He refused to fight.

389
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:12,703
Not quite that, Charles.
He refused to take advantage of you.

390
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:13,738
Take advantage of me?

391
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:15,396
He's one of the best shots in the country...

392
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:16,998
...as he's proved a number of times...

393
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:19,010
...against steadier hands and cooler heads
than yours.

394
00:28:19,078 --> 00:28:20,375
-I'll show him!
-Now, please.

395
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:22,971
Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.

396
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:25,881
You may be needed
for more important fighting, Charles.

397
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:28,619
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Mr. Butler is our guest.

398
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:30,780
I think I'll just show him around.

399
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:44,627
Ashley!

400
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:53,769
Ashley!

401
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:55,404
Scarlett.

402
00:28:57,249 --> 00:28:59,444
Who're you hiding from in here?

403
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,285
What are you up to?

404
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:11,353
Well, why aren't you upstairs resting
with the other girls?

405
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:14,690
What is this, Scarlett? A secret?

406
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,466
Oh, Ashley, Ashley...

407
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:19,297
...l love you.

408
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:20,696
Scarlett!

409
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:22,240
I love you, I do!

410
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:28,239
Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered
every other man's heart today?

411
00:29:28,314 --> 00:29:30,714
You've always had mine.
You cut your teeth on it.

412
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:32,410
Oh, don't tease me now.

413
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:35,282
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you.

414
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:38,983
You mustn't say such things.
You'll hate me for hearing them.

415
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:43,255
Oh, I could never hate you,
and I know you must care about me.

416
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:45,789
Oh, you do care, don't you?

417
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:48,158
Yes...

418
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:49,860
...l care.

419
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:54,170
Oh, can't we go away and forget
we ever said these things?

420
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:57,669
But how can we do that?

421
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,240
Don't you want to marry me?

422
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:01,903
I'm going to marry Melanie.

423
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:04,513
But you can't. Not if you care for me.

424
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,711
Oh, my dear, why must you make me
say things that will hurt you?

425
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,679
How can I make you understand?

426
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,082
You're so young and unthinking.

427
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:14,489
You don't know what marriage means.

428
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,994
I know I love you,
and I want to be your wife.

429
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:18,595
You don't love Melanie.

430
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,198
She's like me, Scarlett.

431
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,329
She's part of my blood
and we understand each other.

432
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:25,500
But you love me.

433
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:27,365
How could I help loving you?

434
00:30:27,873 --> 00:30:30,398
You have all the passion for life that I lack.

435
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:33,044
That kind of love isn't enough
for a successful marriage...

436
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:34,773
...for two people as different as we are.

437
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:38,078
Well, why don't you say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.

438
00:30:38,317 --> 00:30:40,342
You'd rather live with that fool
who can't speak except...

439
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:44,219
...to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel
of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.

440
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,779
You mustn't say such things
about Melanie.

441
00:30:45,858 --> 00:30:47,587
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?

442
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:50,457
You led me on, you made me believe
you wanted to marry me.

443
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:52,861
Now, Scarlett, be fair.
I never, at any time--

444
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:56,458
You did, it's true you did!
I'll hate you till I die!

445
00:30:57,069 --> 00:31:00,368
I can't think of anything bad enough
to call you.

446
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:29,231
Has the war started?

447
00:31:29,835 --> 00:31:33,236
Sir, you should have made
your presence known.

448
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,700
In the middle of that beautiful love scene?

449
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:38,103
That wouldn't have been very tactful,
would it?

450
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:40,737
But don't worry,
your secret is safe with me.

451
00:31:41,346 --> 00:31:42,438
Sir, you are no gentleman!

452
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:44,641
And you, Miss, are no lady.

453
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:46,948
Don't think I hold that against you.

454
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,748
Ladies have never held any charm for me.

455
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:51,847
First you take a low, common advantage
of me, then you insult me.

456
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:55,360
I meant it as a compliment
and I hope to see more of you...

457
00:31:55,427 --> 00:31:58,260
...when you're free of the spell
of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.

458
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,596
He doesn't strike me as half good enough
for a girl of your, what was it?

459
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:04,302
Your "passion for living."

460
00:32:04,503 --> 00:32:07,131
How dare you!
You aren't fit to wipe his boots.

461
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:11,666
And you were going to hate him
for the rest of your life.

462
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:18,005
She certainly made a fool of herself
running after all the men at the barbecue.

463
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,744
That's not fair, lndia.

464
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:22,582
She's so attractive,
the menjust naturally flock to her.

465
00:32:22,688 --> 00:32:24,952
Oh, Melanie, you're just too good
to be true.

466
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,888
Didn't you see her going after
your brother, Charles?

467
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:29,052
Yes, and she knows Charles belongs to me.

468
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,754
Oh, you're wrong, lndia.

469
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:33,889
Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.

470
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:36,933
Men may flirt with girls like that
but they don't marry them.

471
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:39,197
I think you're being very mean to her.

472
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:50,815
War! War's declared! War!

473
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:03,893
Miss O'Hara!

474
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,159
Miss O'Hara!

475
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,666
Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,
volunteers to fight against us.

476
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:14,331
Don't you men ever think
of anything important?

477
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:16,772
But it's war and everybody's going off
to enlist.

478
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,399
They're going right away. I'm going too.

479
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:19,535
Everybody?

480
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:26,249
Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?

481
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:28,279
To see us go, I mean.

482
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,721
I'll cry into my pillow every night.

483
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:32,847
Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.

484
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:37,428
You're the most beautiful girl in the world,
and the sweetest and the dearest.

485
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,861
I know I couldn't hope
that you could love me.

486
00:33:39,932 --> 00:33:43,390
I'm so clumsy and stupid
and not nearly good enough for you.

487
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:47,336
But if you could think of marrying me
I'd do anything in the world for you.

488
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:49,030
Just anything. I promise.

489
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:50,837
What did you say?

490
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:53,776
Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?

491
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:01,519
Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.

492
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,384
You will? You'll marry me.
You'll wait for me?

493
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:06,085
I don't think I'd want to wait.

494
00:34:06,158 --> 00:34:08,592
You mean you'll marry me before I go?

495
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:11,062
Oh, Miss O'Hara.

496
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:12,858
Scarlett....

497
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:16,023
When may I speak to your father?

498
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:17,159
The sooner the better.

499
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:18,793
I'll go now. I can't wait.

500
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,770
Will you excuse me, dear?

501
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:27,576
Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.

502
00:34:27,646 --> 00:34:29,511
It'll be a week at least
before they call on me.

503
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:32,709
Only a week, and then they'll take you
away from me.

504
00:35:05,951 --> 00:35:08,579
Scarlett, I thought of you
at our wedding yesterday...

505
00:35:08,654 --> 00:35:11,748
...and I hoped that yours would be
as beautiful, and it was.

506
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:13,415
Was it?

507
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:16,259
Now we're really and truly sisters.

508
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:18,418
-Charles.
-Melanie.

509
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:29,466
Don't cry, darling,
the war will be over in a few weeks...

510
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,668
...and I'll be coming back to you.

511
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:17,152
Miss Scarlett!

512
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:20,986
Well, I don't care.
I'm too young to be a widow.

513
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:22,490
Miss Scarlett!

514
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,957
Why, I just go around scaring people
in that thing.

515
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:30,558
You ain't supposed to be around people.
You's in mournin'.

516
00:36:30,635 --> 00:36:32,933
For what? I don't feel anything.

517
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:36,267
Why should I have to pretend
and pretend....

518
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:38,409
What is it?

519
00:36:39,144 --> 00:36:41,237
Oh, baby....

520
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:43,570
What is it?

521
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:45,439
My life is over.

522
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:48,411
Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.

523
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:52,121
Oh, Mother.

524
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,354
I know you'll think I'm horrible,
but I just can't bear going around in black.

525
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:59,523
It's bad enough not being able
to go to any parties...

526
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:01,188
...but looking this way too.

527
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,200
I don't think you're at all horrible.

528
00:37:03,335 --> 00:37:07,169
It's only natural to want to look young
and be young when you are young.

529
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,468
Oh, baby....

530
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:12,410
How would you like
to go visiting somewhere?

531
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:13,637
Savannah perhaps?

532
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:15,771
What would I do in Savannah?

533
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:17,777
Well, Atlanta then.

534
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,044
There's lots going on there.

535
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:23,087
And you could stay
with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.

536
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:25,182
Melanie.

537
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:26,750
Yes.

538
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:28,720
Yes, I could, couldn't l?

539
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:31,922
Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,
sweeter than anybody in the world.

540
00:37:31,997 --> 00:37:33,362
You'd like it, really?

541
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:37,164
All right then.
Now stop your crying and smile.

542
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,631
You can take Prissy with you.

543
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,501
Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,
Mammy.

544
00:37:43,909 --> 00:37:45,809
I'll go write the necessary letters.

545
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:49,936
Atlanta!

546
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:53,615
Savannah would be better for you.
You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.

547
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,152
What trouble are you talking about?

548
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,656
You know what trouble I's talkin' about.
I's talkin' about Mist' Ashley Wilkes.

549
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:00,588
He'll be comin' to Atlanta
when he gets his leave...

550
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:03,253
...and you're sittin' there waitin'
for him just like a spider!

551
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:06,820
-He belongs to Miss Melanie--
-You go pack my things like Mother said.

552
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:30,651
They're all whispering,
and I just know it's about her.

553
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:32,620
What's it matter what they say,
Aunt Pittypat?

554
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:37,321
But Scarlett is living under my roof
so they all think I'm responsible for her...

555
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:41,226
...and for a widow to appear in public
at a social gathering!

556
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:44,027
Every time I think of it I feel faint!

557
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:48,334
Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here
only to help raise money for the cause.

558
00:38:48,406 --> 00:38:51,466
It was splendid of her
to make the sacrifice.

559
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,339
Anyone would think, to hear you talk...

560
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:56,903
...that she came here to dance
instead of to sell things.

561
00:39:09,261 --> 00:39:10,990
Ladies and gentlemen!

562
00:39:11,062 --> 00:39:13,758
I have important news! Glorious news!

563
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:17,226
Another triumph
for our magnificent men in arms.

564
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:21,097
General Lee has completely
whipped the enemy.

565
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:25,266
And swept the Yankee Army
northward from Virginia.

566
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:37,514
And now, a happy surprise for all of us.

567
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:42,119
We have with us tonight that most daring
of all blockade-runners...

568
00:39:42,494 --> 00:39:45,895
...whose fleet schooners,
slipping past the Yankee guns...

569
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:49,965
...have brought us here the very woolens
and laces we wear tonight.

570
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:54,229
I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that
will-o'-the-wisp of the bounding main.

571
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:57,237
None other than our friend
from Charleston...

572
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,100
...Captain Rhett Butler!

573
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:21,464
Permit me.

574
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,967
Captain Butler, it's such a pleasure
to see you again.

575
00:40:29,274 --> 00:40:31,299
I met you last at my husband's home.

576
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:33,639
That's kind of you to remember,
Mrs. Wilkes.

577
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:36,673
Did you meet Captain Butler
at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?

578
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:38,841
Yes. I, I think so.

579
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:41,745
Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.
It was in the library.

580
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,720
You had broken something.

581
00:40:44,823 --> 00:40:47,257
Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.

582
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:51,125
Ladies, the Confederacy asks for
your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.

583
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:53,488
We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.

584
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:54,827
Wait.

585
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,799
On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes
and Mrs. Hamilton.

586
00:40:58,837 --> 00:41:00,168
Thank you, Captain Butler.

587
00:41:00,472 --> 00:41:02,099
Just a moment, please.

588
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:07,201
But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.

589
00:41:07,345 --> 00:41:10,644
It may help my husband more,
off my finger.

590
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:12,408
Thank you.

591
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:17,446
That's a very beautiful thing to do,
Mrs. Wilkes.

592
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:19,014
Here.

593
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,850
You can have mine, too, for the cause.

594
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:27,997
And you, Mrs. Hamilton.
I know just how much that means to you.

595
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:29,664
-Melanie!
-Yes, Dr. Meade.

596
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:32,066
I need your approval,
as a member of the Committee...

597
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:34,662
...for something we want to do
that's rather shocking.

598
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:37,364
Will you excuse us, please?

599
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,873
I'll say one thing, the war makes
the most peculiar widows.

600
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:44,308
I wish you'd go away.

601
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:47,579
If you had any raising you'd know
I never want to see you again.

602
00:41:50,455 --> 00:41:51,922
Now, why be silly?

603
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,154
You've no reason for hating me.
I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.

604
00:41:57,862 --> 00:42:01,593
I guess I'd be very unpatriotic
to hate one of the great heroes of the war.

605
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:05,295
I do declare I was surprised to see
you turn out to be such a noble character.

606
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:08,862
I can't bear to take advantage
of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.

607
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,999
I'm neither noble nor heroic.

608
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:12,537
But you are a blockade-runner.

609
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,669
For profit, and profit only.

610
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:17,114
Are you telling me
you don't believe in the cause?

611
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:19,616
I believe in Rhett Butler.
He's the only cause I know.

612
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:21,749
The rest doesn't mean much to me.

613
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:26,791
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

614
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:29,860
...l have a startling surprise
for the benefit of the hospital.

615
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:35,759
Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening
reel with the lady of your choice...

616
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:37,796
...you must bid for her.

617
00:42:39,304 --> 00:42:42,364
Caroline Meade, how can you permit
your husband to conduct this...

618
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,067
...this slave auction?

619
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:46,702
Dolly Merriwether,
how dare you criticize me!

620
00:42:47,078 --> 00:42:48,705
Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...

621
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,611
...that if it's for the benefit of the cause,
it's quite all right.

622
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:52,945
She did!

623
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:56,043
Oh dear, oh dear.
Where are my smelling salts?

624
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,581
I think I shall faint.

625
00:42:57,722 --> 00:43:00,054
Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.

626
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:02,852
If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.

627
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:06,893
Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?
Make your offers.

628
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:09,493
Don't be bashful, gentlemen.

629
00:43:10,301 --> 00:43:14,203
Twenty dollars,
$20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.

630
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:16,534
Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing.

631
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:18,735
Only $25 to give your--

632
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:20,936
One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.

633
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:22,673
For what lady, sir?

634
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,748
For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

635
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:28,744
For whom, sir?

636
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,678
Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

637
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:33,050
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,
Captain Butler...

638
00:43:33,158 --> 00:43:35,922
...but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles
would be proud to--

639
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:39,452
Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.

640
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:42,460
She will not consider it, sir.

641
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,031
Oh yes, I will.

642
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:59,512
Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.

643
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:02,610
We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.

644
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,450
It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?

645
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:05,713
It's worse.

646
00:44:05,857 --> 00:44:07,848
But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.

647
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:09,689
I don't care what you expect
or what they think.

648
00:44:09,761 --> 00:44:11,251
I'm going to dance and dance.

649
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:14,355
Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing
with Abe Lincoln himself.

650
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:48,791
Another dance and my reputation
will be lost forever.

651
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:51,061
With enough courage,
you can do without a reputation.

652
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,160
Oh, you do talk scandalous.

653
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:03,476
You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.

654
00:45:03,715 --> 00:45:07,515
Don't start flirting with me.
I'm not one of your plantation beaux.

655
00:45:07,652 --> 00:45:09,882
I want more than flirting from you.

656
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:11,718
What do you want?

657
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:16,859
I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take
that Southern belle simper off your face.

658
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:19,253
Some day I want you to say to me...

659
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,163
...the words I heard you say
to Ashley Wilkes:

660
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:23,693
"l love you."

661
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:28,467
That's something you'll never hear from
me, Captain Butler, as long as you live.

662
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:50,758
How sweet, how kind.

663
00:45:51,329 --> 00:45:53,297
He is a thoughtful gentleman.

664
00:45:53,364 --> 00:45:57,095
Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say
something about my sacrifice?

665
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:07,102
Oh, the darling thing.

666
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:09,112
Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.

667
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,374
You didn't really bring it all the way
from Paris just for me.

668
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,908
Yes, I thought it was about time
I got you out of that fake mourning.

669
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,351
Next trip I'll bring you some green silk
for a frock to match it.

670
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:20,448
Oh, Rhett.

671
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:25,858
It's my duty to our brave boys at the front
to keep our girls at home looking pretty.

672
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:29,525
Oh, it's so long
since I've had anything new.

673
00:46:39,711 --> 00:46:41,042
How do I look?

674
00:46:41,979 --> 00:46:43,606
Awful! Just awful.

675
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:45,544
Why, what's the matter?

676
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:46,844
This war has stopped being a joke...

677
00:46:46,918 --> 00:46:50,183
...when a girl like you doesn't know how
to wear the latest fashion.

678
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:58,017
Oh, Rhett, let me do it.

679
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:06,494
But, Rhett, I don't know how I dare wear it.

680
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:08,804
You will though.

681
00:47:09,374 --> 00:47:11,865
And another thing, those pantalettes.

682
00:47:12,043 --> 00:47:14,807
I don't know a woman in Paris
that wears pantalettes anymore.

683
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:16,141
Oh, what do they...?

684
00:47:16,547 --> 00:47:18,674
You shouldn't talk about such things.

685
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,739
You little hypocrite.

686
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:22,479
You don't mind my knowing about them,
just my talking.

687
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:26,250
But, I really can't go on accepting gifts
from you, though you are awfully kind.

688
00:47:26,324 --> 00:47:28,292
I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.

689
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:32,192
I never give anything without expecting
something in return. I always get paid.

690
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:34,663
If you think I'll marry you to pay
for the bonnet, I won't.

691
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:37,326
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not a marrying man.

692
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:40,765
Well, I won't kiss you for it either.

693
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:52,811
Open your eyes and look at me.

694
00:47:54,252 --> 00:47:56,186
No, I don't think I will kiss you...

695
00:47:56,254 --> 00:47:57,949
...although you need kissing badly.

696
00:47:58,022 --> 00:47:59,353
That's what's wrong with you.

697
00:47:59,424 --> 00:48:02,359
You should be kissed and often.
And by someone who knows how.

698
00:48:02,427 --> 00:48:05,089
Oh, and I suppose you think
you're the proper person.

699
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:07,961
I might be, if the right moment ever came.

700
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:11,162
You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,
Rhett Butler.

701
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:13,965
And I don't know why
I let you come and see me.

702
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:15,932
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.

703
00:48:16,007 --> 00:48:18,202
Because I'm the only man over 16
and under 60...

704
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:20,574
...who's around to show you a good time.

705
00:48:20,645 --> 00:48:23,205
But cheer up,
the war can't last much longer.

706
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:25,076
Oh really, Rhett? Why?

707
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:28,243
There's a battle going on right now
that ought to pretty well fix things...

708
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,308
...one way or the other.

709
00:48:29,387 --> 00:48:31,480
Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?

710
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:36,490
You still haven't gotten the wooden-headed
Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.

711
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:37,892
Yes, I suppose he's in it.

712
00:48:37,962 --> 00:48:39,953
Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?

713
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:43,427
Some little town in Pennsylvania
called Gettysburg.

714
00:50:04,882 --> 00:50:05,974
Here you is, Miss Melanie.

715
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,746
They was fightin' for them
so it just got tore in half.

716
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,818
Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end.

717
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:19,093
Wellman, Wendell, White,
Whitner, Wilkins...

718
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:20,958
...Williams, Woolsey, Workman.

719
00:50:21,032 --> 00:50:23,296
Scarlett, you've passed him.

720
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:25,732
Oh, he isn't there!

721
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:26,770
He isn't there!

722
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:29,067
Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.

723
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,301
Oh, he's safe, he's safe.

724
00:50:33,144 --> 00:50:37,137
Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet
to worry about Ashley like this for me.

725
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:46,022
I must go to her.

726
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:49,456
Don't, my dear, not here.

727
00:50:50,428 --> 00:50:51,690
Let's go home.

728
00:50:53,064 --> 00:50:54,759
Dr. Meade, not....

729
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:57,494
Yes, our boy, Darcy.

730
00:50:58,269 --> 00:51:00,965
I was making these mittens for him.

731
00:51:01,572 --> 00:51:03,403
He won't need them now.

732
00:51:04,442 --> 00:51:08,310
Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show 'em.
I'll kill all those Yankees.

733
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:09,811
Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.

734
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,110
Do you think it will help your mother
to have you off getting shot too?

735
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:14,014
I never heard of anything so silly.

736
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:19,882
It's a black day, Scarlett.
You haven't had bad news, have you?

737
00:51:20,024 --> 00:51:21,218
Ashley's safe.

738
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:23,154
I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.

739
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:24,717
But, Rhett, there are so many others.

740
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:25,693
Many of your friends?

741
00:51:25,763 --> 00:51:29,494
Just about every family in the county.
The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.

742
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:33,264
Yes, look at them.
All these poor tragic people.

743
00:51:34,138 --> 00:51:37,665
The South's sinking to its knees.
It'll never rise again.

744
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:39,773
The cause....

745
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:43,205
The cause of living in the past is dying
right in front of us.

746
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:45,349
I never heard you talk like that before.

747
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:49,580
I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.
And that's what all this is, sheer waste.

748
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:53,313
But don't you be downcast.

749
00:51:53,624 --> 00:51:57,060
Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home
to the women who love him...

750
00:51:57,395 --> 00:51:58,794
...both of them.

751
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:37,057
Oh, you're here.

752
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:43,440
Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.

753
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:45,936
Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.

754
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:48,543
Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.

755
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,542
Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.

756
00:52:56,053 --> 00:52:57,350
Scarlett, dear.

757
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:03,556
Well, is this any way to greet
a returning warrior?

758
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:05,418
Ashley, l....

759
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:10,428
Merry Christmas, Ashley.

760
00:53:19,043 --> 00:53:22,843
Come on, old gentleman, come on.
We've got all your wives.

761
00:53:23,414 --> 00:53:25,348
We've got all your little chicks.

762
00:53:25,516 --> 00:53:28,644
You got nobody to worry your head
about leavin'.

763
00:53:29,186 --> 00:53:30,244
Come on.

764
00:53:30,521 --> 00:53:34,924
Now you just stand still so you can be
a Christmas gift for the white folks.

765
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:36,323
Now hold on.

766
00:53:37,061 --> 00:53:38,050
Hold on!

767
00:53:38,763 --> 00:53:40,822
Don't go gettin' so uppity...

768
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:43,398
...even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.

769
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,202
Let's not talk about the war.
It's Christmas.

770
00:53:48,272 --> 00:53:51,969
Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara
and all the times before the war.

771
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:53,532
Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?

772
00:53:53,611 --> 00:53:56,045
Why did you say there wasn't enough,
Uncle Peter?

773
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:59,640
There's plenty. It's the very last
of my father's fine Madeira.

774
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,752
He got it from his uncle,
Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...

775
00:54:03,988 --> 00:54:07,389
...who married his cousin,
Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...

776
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:11,026
...who was his second cousin once removed
and a kin to the Wilkeses too.

777
00:54:11,295 --> 00:54:14,696
I saved it to wish Ashley
a Merry Christmas.

778
00:54:15,366 --> 00:54:19,063
But you mustn't drink it all at once
because it is the last.

779
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:26,672
I meant it, my dear.
It was a lovely Christmas gift.

780
00:54:26,944 --> 00:54:29,208
Only generals have tunics like this,
nowadays.

781
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,143
I'm so happy you like it, dear.

782
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:32,876
Where did you get the cloth?

783
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,210
It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.

784
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:39,083
I nursed her son while he was in
the hospital, Ashley, before he died and....

785
00:54:39,824 --> 00:54:42,452
Oh, you will take good care of it,
won't you?

786
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,853
You won't let it get torn.

787
00:54:45,296 --> 00:54:46,285
Promise me.

788
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:47,523
You mustn't worry.

789
00:54:48,032 --> 00:54:51,433
I'll bring it back to you
without any holes in it, I promise.

790
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:55,427
Good night, my dear.

791
00:54:55,506 --> 00:54:57,371
Good night, Scarlett, darling.

792
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:13,251
Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,
for Mr. Ashley to leave?

793
00:55:13,324 --> 00:55:15,053
Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.

794
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:18,583
She isn't going to the depot with him?
She hasn't changed her mind?

795
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:20,357
No, ma'am. She's layin' down.

796
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:24,457
She's so upset Mist' Wilkes told her
she can't even come downstairs.

797
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,008
Ashley!

798
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,779
Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.

799
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:42,683
Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you
as you are now...

800
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,683
...not shivering at the depot.

801
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:46,416
All right.

802
00:55:47,091 --> 00:55:49,924
Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.

803
00:55:56,934 --> 00:55:58,902
Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.

804
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:01,532
Tie it on me, my dear.

805
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:06,674
While Melly was making your new tunic,
I made this to go with it.

806
00:56:07,077 --> 00:56:08,339
You made it yourself?

807
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,213
Well, then I shall value it all the more.

808
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:15,643
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

809
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:18,444
There's something you can do for me.

810
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:19,647
What is it?

811
00:56:20,057 --> 00:56:22,116
Will you look after Melanie for me?

812
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,320
She's so frail and gentle
and she loves you so much.

813
00:56:26,797 --> 00:56:28,162
You see, if I were killed and she--

814
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:31,861
Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.
Say a prayer quickly.

815
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:33,626
You say one for me.

816
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:38,039
We shall need all our prayers
now the end is coming.

817
00:56:38,342 --> 00:56:39,309
The end?

818
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:40,843
The end of the war.

819
00:56:41,645 --> 00:56:43,510
And the end of our world, Scarlett.

820
00:56:44,949 --> 00:56:47,918
But, Ashley, you don't think
the Yankees are beating us?

821
00:56:47,985 --> 00:56:50,681
Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...

822
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:54,221
...and the snow in Virginia is deep.

823
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:56,426
When I see them...

824
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,194
...and I see the Yankees coming
and coming, always more and more....

825
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:06,931
Well, when the end does come
I shall be far away.

826
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:10,396
It'll be a comfort to me to know
that she has you.

827
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:13,635
You will promise, won't you?

828
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,069
Yes.

829
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:20,211
Is that all, Ashley?

830
00:57:21,218 --> 00:57:23,778
All except, goodbye.

831
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:26,389
Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.

832
00:57:26,457 --> 00:57:27,583
-You must be brave--
-No....

833
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:28,955
You must.

834
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,551
How else can I bear going?

835
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,958
Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine
and strong and beautiful.

836
00:57:37,368 --> 00:57:39,233
Not just your sweet face, my dear...

837
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:41,602
...but you.

838
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,070
Oh, Ashley, kiss me.

839
00:57:47,878 --> 00:57:49,539
Kiss me goodbye!

840
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:57,175
No, Scarlett.

841
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:58,846
Oh, Ashley, I love you.

842
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:02,324
I've always loved you.
I never loved anyone else.

843
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:04,992
I only married Charles just to hurt you.

844
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:07,528
Oh, Ashley. Tell me you love me.

845
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:11,033
I'll live on it the rest of my life.

846
00:58:12,903 --> 00:58:14,029
Goodbye.

847
00:58:33,924 --> 00:58:36,154
When the war is over, Ashley.

848
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,894
When the war is over.

849
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,846
And there's a place back home...

850
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:04,849
...where a wild plum tree comes to flower
in the springtime.

851
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:07,783
Down by the creek, you know.

852
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:09,782
Yes, I know, I know.

853
00:59:10,727 --> 00:59:14,026
When we were little,
my brother, Jeff, and I used to....

854
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:17,622
I told you about my brother, Jeff,
didn't l, ma'am?

855
00:59:18,102 --> 00:59:19,399
I know I did.

856
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:20,929
He....

857
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:24,004
We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.

858
00:59:24,508 --> 00:59:27,807
Since Bull Run we haven't heard
anything and....

859
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:30,576
Please, we must have
your temperature now.

860
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:33,272
Just take this in your mouth
and not talk anymore.

861
00:59:33,484 --> 00:59:34,917
Not just now.

862
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:38,083
Melanie, I'm so tired I've gotta go home.

863
00:59:39,223 --> 00:59:40,884
Aren't you tired, Melanie?

864
00:59:41,425 --> 00:59:44,053
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

865
00:59:44,728 --> 00:59:46,252
This might be...

866
00:59:46,497 --> 00:59:47,521
...Ashley.

867
00:59:48,265 --> 00:59:51,132
And only strangers here to comfort him.

868
00:59:51,568 --> 00:59:53,559
No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.

869
00:59:54,738 --> 00:59:56,433
They could all be...

870
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,202
...Ashley.

871
01:00:10,454 --> 01:00:14,390
I've been sittin' by this curb one solid hour
waitin' to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.

872
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:17,120
Go on, you trash,
don't you be pesterin' these ladies.

873
01:00:17,261 --> 01:00:18,751
Don't talk to her, Melly.

874
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:20,990
It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?

875
01:00:21,265 --> 01:00:23,790
My name's Belle Watlin'.
But that don't matter.

876
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:26,262
I expect you think
I've got no business here.

877
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:28,896
Hadn't you best tell me
what you want to see me about?

878
01:00:28,972 --> 01:00:32,237
First time I come here, I says,
"Belle, you're a nurse."

879
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:34,535
But the ladies didn't want
my kind of nursin'.

880
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:36,704
Well, they was more than likely right.

881
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,543
Then I tried givin' 'em money.

882
01:00:38,682 --> 01:00:41,150
My money wasn't good enough
for 'em, either.

883
01:00:41,285 --> 01:00:42,616
Old pea-hens!

884
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:45,554
I know a gentleman
who says you're a human bein'.

885
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:49,417
If you are, which they ain't,
you'll take my money for the hospital.

886
01:00:49,493 --> 01:00:52,724
What are you doing here?
Haven't you been told twice already?

887
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:54,787
This time I'm conversin' with Miss Wilkes.

888
01:00:54,865 --> 01:00:56,856
You might as well take my money,
Miss Wilkes.

889
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:58,834
It's good money, even if it is mine.

890
01:00:59,136 --> 01:01:00,728
I'm sure you're very generous.

891
01:01:00,804 --> 01:01:03,932
No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate
like everybody else, that's all.

892
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:05,338
Of course you are.

893
01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:07,873
There's some folks here
wouldn't feel that way.

894
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:10,470
But maybe they ain't
as good Christians as you.

895
01:01:17,754 --> 01:01:20,484
Look, Mrs. Meade.
It's a great deal of money.

896
01:01:20,857 --> 01:01:23,018
Ten, $20, $30, $50.

897
01:01:23,427 --> 01:01:25,759
And it's not our paper money. It's gold.

898
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:28,025
Let me see that handkerchief.

899
01:01:28,398 --> 01:01:29,524
"R. B."

900
01:01:32,002 --> 01:01:35,199
And she's driving away
in Rhett Butler's carriage!

901
01:01:36,073 --> 01:01:39,201
Oh, if I just wasn't a lady
what wouldn't I tell that varmint!

902
01:02:14,144 --> 01:02:16,874
"The Lord is my Shepherd.
I shall not want.

903
01:02:17,147 --> 01:02:19,775
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

904
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:21,277
"He leadeth....

905
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,247
"He restoreth my soul.

906
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:29,290
"He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.

907
01:02:29,993 --> 01:02:33,224
"Yeah, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

908
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:35,224
"...l will fear no evil.

909
01:02:35,532 --> 01:02:36,794
"For Thou art with me.

910
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,660
"Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."

911
01:02:40,704 --> 01:02:41,693
Yankees!

912
01:02:42,272 --> 01:02:45,207
The Yankees!
Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.

913
01:02:45,442 --> 01:02:50,004
They'll never get into Atlanta.
They'll never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.

914
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:53,244
Give me something for the pain.

915
01:02:53,684 --> 01:02:55,276
Give me something for the pain!

916
01:02:55,419 --> 01:02:57,649
Sorry, son, we haven't got anything
to give you.

917
01:02:59,623 --> 01:03:02,183
These animules is drivin' me crazy!

918
01:03:03,727 --> 01:03:05,718
What luck! You've got my jack...!

919
01:03:05,962 --> 01:03:08,556
Give me an ace and I'll start another war!

920
01:03:08,632 --> 01:03:10,293
I'll bid the moon!

921
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:18,201
That I'll never see you or Pa again.

922
01:03:19,343 --> 01:03:20,867
This leg's got to come off, soldier.

923
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:23,276
No, no! Leave me alone!

924
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,606
I'm sorry, soldier.

925
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:26,478
We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.

926
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:28,108
Then we'll have to operate without it.

927
01:03:28,185 --> 01:03:29,982
No, no! Leave me alone!

928
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:32,585
You can't do it. I won't let you do it to me!

929
01:03:32,656 --> 01:03:35,591
Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off
immediately. It's gangrene.

930
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:37,786
No, no! Don't!

931
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:40,791
I haven't seen my family in three days.

932
01:03:40,864 --> 01:03:42,661
I'm going home for half an hour.

933
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:44,691
Orderly! Give me a lift.

934
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:50,998
Nurse, you can free this bed.

935
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:53,508
Miss Scarlett!

936
01:03:55,312 --> 01:03:56,973
Why, Frank Kennedy!

937
01:03:57,047 --> 01:03:59,106
Miss Suellen, is she well?

938
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:02,612
When did they bring you in?
You all right? Are you badly hurt?

939
01:04:02,686 --> 01:04:05,280
-But Miss Suellen, is she--
-She's all right, but l--

940
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:07,255
Dr. Wilson needs you
in the operating room.

941
01:04:07,324 --> 01:04:09,690
He's going to take off that leg.
Better hurry.

942
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:13,028
I'll be back.

943
01:04:14,398 --> 01:04:16,889
No, no, leave me alone!

944
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:20,165
No, no, I can't stand it!

945
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:23,198
No don't! Don't cut!

946
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,371
Don't cut!

947
01:04:25,876 --> 01:04:27,673
Don't, don't!

948
01:04:28,078 --> 01:04:29,204
Please!

949
01:04:29,546 --> 01:04:31,377
Where's the nurse?

950
01:04:35,218 --> 01:04:36,708
Mrs. Hamilton, Dr. Wilson's waiting.

951
01:04:36,787 --> 01:04:39,187
Let him wait! I'm going home!
I've done enough.

952
01:04:39,256 --> 01:04:42,748
I don't want any more men dying!
I don't want any more!

953
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:45,544
Big Sam!

954
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:48,257
Big Sam! Big Sam!

955
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,691
Almighty Moses, it's Miss Scarlett!

956
01:05:51,828 --> 01:05:52,988
Big Sam!

957
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:54,619
Big Sam!

958
01:05:54,698 --> 01:05:58,065
Sam, 'Lige, 'Postel, Prophet!
I'm so glad to see you!

959
01:05:58,335 --> 01:06:00,963
Tell me about Tara, about my mother.
She didn't write me.

960
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:03,164
-She's gone and got sick, Miss Scarlett.
-Sick?

961
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,140
Just a little bit sick, that's all.

962
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:08,234
Your pa was wild when they wouldn't
let him fight 'cause of his broken knee.

963
01:06:08,311 --> 01:06:12,270
He had fits when they took us field hands
to dig ditches for white soldiers to hide in.

964
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:14,442
But your ma says
the Confederacy needs us.

965
01:06:14,518 --> 01:06:15,849
So we're gonna dig for the South.

966
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:17,079
Sam, was there a doctor?

967
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:18,347
Sorry, ma'am, we've got to march.

968
01:06:18,421 --> 01:06:21,185
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.

969
01:06:21,258 --> 01:06:24,853
Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.
If any of you get sick or hurt, let me know.

970
01:06:24,928 --> 01:06:26,452
-Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
-Goodbye.

971
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:28,020
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

972
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:49,578
Scarlett!

973
01:06:49,753 --> 01:06:50,811
Scarlett!

974
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:57,317
Climb into this buggy.
This is no day for walking.

975
01:06:57,394 --> 01:06:58,486
You'll get run over.

976
01:06:58,562 --> 01:06:59,790
Oh, Rhett!

977
01:07:00,397 --> 01:07:02,627
Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.

978
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,065
Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?

979
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,033
That's just another of General Sherman's
calling cards.

980
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:13,370
He'll be paying us a visit soon.

981
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:16,173
I've gotta get out of here
before the Yankees come!

982
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:18,109
And leave your work at the hospital?

983
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:21,947
Or have you had enough of death and lice
and men chopped up?

984
01:07:22,218 --> 01:07:24,516
I suppose you weren't meant
for sick men, Scarlett.

985
01:07:24,588 --> 01:07:26,613
Don't talk to me like that. I'm so scared.

986
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:28,453
I wish I could get out of here.

987
01:07:28,992 --> 01:07:30,425
Let's get out of here together.

988
01:07:30,493 --> 01:07:33,462
No use staying here and letting the South
come down around your ears.

989
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:35,998
There are too many nice places
to go and visit.

990
01:07:36,499 --> 01:07:38,490
Mexico, London, Paris....

991
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:40,329
-With you?
-Yes, ma'am.

992
01:07:41,037 --> 01:07:44,438
With a man who understands you
and admires you for just what you are.

993
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:47,601
I figure we belong together,
being the same sort.

994
01:07:47,911 --> 01:07:52,348
I've been waiting for you to grow up and
get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.

995
01:07:52,616 --> 01:07:56,245
Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have
a baby in another month or so.

996
01:07:57,253 --> 01:08:00,689
It'll be hard loving a man
with a wife and baby clinging to him.

997
01:08:03,493 --> 01:08:07,554
Well, here we are. Are you going with me,
or are you getting out?

998
01:08:07,831 --> 01:08:12,666
I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler,
and I'll hate and despise you till I die.

999
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:16,165
Oh no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long.

1000
01:08:23,747 --> 01:08:25,271
Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!

1001
01:08:25,348 --> 01:08:29,045
Folks is all goin' to Macon
and folks is runnin' away and runnin' away.

1002
01:08:29,285 --> 01:08:32,448
I can't bear it!
Those cannon balls right in my ears!

1003
01:08:32,722 --> 01:08:34,815
I faint every time I hear one!

1004
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:38,156
Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk!

1005
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:39,523
But, Aunt Pitty, you aren't leaving?

1006
01:08:39,596 --> 01:08:41,928
I may be a coward, but oh dear!

1007
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,600
Yankees in Georgia!

1008
01:08:44,968 --> 01:08:46,196
How did they ever get in?

1009
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:48,931
I'm going, too. Prissy, go pack my things.
Get them, quick!

1010
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:50,700
Wait, Aunt Pitty, I won't take a minute.

1011
01:08:50,774 --> 01:08:52,503
Scarlett, do you really think you ought to?

1012
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:53,667
Scarlett!

1013
01:08:53,943 --> 01:08:56,912
What is this?
You ain't planning on running away?

1014
01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:00,279
And don't you dare try to stop me.
I'm never going back to that hospital.

1015
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:03,285
I've had enough of smelling death
and rot and death.

1016
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:06,547
I'm going home. I want my mother.
My mother needs me.

1017
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:09,486
Now you've got to listen to me.
You must stay here!

1018
01:09:09,559 --> 01:09:12,551
Without a chaperon, Dr. Meade?
It simply isn't done!

1019
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:15,325
Good heavens, woman, this is war,
not a garden party!

1020
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:16,990
You've got to stay. Melanie needs you.

1021
01:09:17,067 --> 01:09:18,091
Oh, bother Melanie.

1022
01:09:18,168 --> 01:09:20,602
She's ill already.
She shouldn't even be having a baby.

1023
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,796
She may have a difficult time.

1024
01:09:21,871 --> 01:09:23,236
Well, can't we take her along?

1025
01:09:23,373 --> 01:09:24,670
Do you want her to take that chance?

1026
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:26,470
Do you want her to be jounced
over rough roads...

1027
01:09:26,543 --> 01:09:28,306
...and have her baby ahead of time,
in a buggy?

1028
01:09:28,378 --> 01:09:30,175
It isn't my baby! You take care of her!

1029
01:09:30,246 --> 01:09:32,271
Scarlett! We haven't enough doctors...

1030
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:34,646
...much less nurses
to look after a sick woman.

1031
01:09:34,718 --> 01:09:36,151
You've got to stay for Melanie.

1032
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:37,151
What for?

1033
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,154
I don't know anything about babies
being born!

1034
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:40,780
I knows, I knows.

1035
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,618
I knows how to do it.
I's done it lots and lots.

1036
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,693
Let me, Doctor, let me. I can do everythin'.

1037
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:49,922
-Good. Then I'll rely on you to help us.
-Yes, Doctor.

1038
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:53,025
Ashley's fighting in the field,
fighting for the cause.

1039
01:09:53,303 --> 01:09:55,828
He may never come back. He may die.

1040
01:09:56,506 --> 01:09:59,031
Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.

1041
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:00,798
Ashley.

1042
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:03,402
If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!

1043
01:10:03,713 --> 01:10:05,305
I promised Ashley...

1044
01:10:05,582 --> 01:10:06,514
...something.

1045
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,107
Then you'll stay?

1046
01:10:08,518 --> 01:10:11,544
Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.
Scarlett's staying.

1047
01:10:11,688 --> 01:10:14,885
Go on, Uncle Peter.
Oh dear, I don't know what to do.

1048
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:17,388
It's like the end of the world.

1049
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:21,522
Uncle Peter, my smelling salts.

1050
01:10:28,705 --> 01:10:31,003
Melanie, it's all your fault!

1051
01:10:31,374 --> 01:10:33,501
I hate you, I hate you!

1052
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:34,838
And I hate your baby!

1053
01:10:35,311 --> 01:10:37,279
If only I hadn't promised Ashley!

1054
01:10:37,714 --> 01:10:39,739
If only I hadn't promised him!

1055
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:11,412
Stop! Stop, please stop!

1056
01:11:11,815 --> 01:11:13,442
Is it true? Are the Yankees coming?

1057
01:11:13,516 --> 01:11:15,245
I'm afraid so, ma'am.
The Army's pullin' out.

1058
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:17,513
Pulling out of Atlanta?
Leaving us to the Yankees?

1059
01:11:17,587 --> 01:11:18,952
Not leavin', ma'am, evacuatin'.

1060
01:11:19,022 --> 01:11:22,082
We've got to before Sherman cuts
the McDonough Road and catches us.

1061
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:25,286
It can't be true! It can't be true!
What'll I do?

1062
01:11:25,361 --> 01:11:28,694
Better refugee south right quick, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

1063
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,155
Prissy!

1064
01:11:32,402 --> 01:11:34,233
Prissy, come here!

1065
01:11:34,304 --> 01:11:37,535
Go pack my things and Miss Melanie's too.
We're going to Tara right away.

1066
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:38,596
The Yankees are coming!

1067
01:11:38,675 --> 01:11:39,869
Yes, ma'am.

1068
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:42,501
Scarlett!

1069
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:44,036
Scarlett!

1070
01:11:44,747 --> 01:11:46,806
Melly, we're going to....

1071
01:11:48,918 --> 01:11:49,885
Melly!

1072
01:11:52,522 --> 01:11:55,980
I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.

1073
01:11:58,428 --> 01:12:00,658
It began at daybreak.

1074
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:02,425
But, but....

1075
01:12:03,499 --> 01:12:05,364
But the Yankees are coming.

1076
01:12:06,769 --> 01:12:08,066
Poor Scarlett.

1077
01:12:08,805 --> 01:12:11,933
You'd be at Tara now with your mother,
wouldn't you...

1078
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:14,199
...if it weren't for me?

1079
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:17,042
Oh, Scarlett, darling...

1080
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,280
...you've been so good to me.

1081
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:21,850
No sister could have been sweeter.

1082
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:27,253
I've been lying here thinking...

1083
01:12:28,091 --> 01:12:29,786
...if I should die...

1084
01:12:30,927 --> 01:12:32,952
...will you take my baby?

1085
01:12:35,098 --> 01:12:37,123
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.

1086
01:12:37,467 --> 01:12:40,402
Aren't things bad enough
without you talking about dying?

1087
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:43,471
-I'll send for Dr. Meade right now.
-Not yet, Scarlett.

1088
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:46,266
I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here
for hours, while...

1089
01:12:47,377 --> 01:12:51,279
-...while all those poor, wounded boys--
-Melly, Prissy!

1090
01:12:52,482 --> 01:12:54,473
Prissy! Prissy! Come here, quick!

1091
01:12:54,951 --> 01:12:56,418
Go get Dr. Meade! Run quick!

1092
01:12:56,486 --> 01:12:58,852
Yes, ma'am. The baby!

1093
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:02,947
Well, don't stand there like a scared goat.
Run!

1094
01:13:04,327 --> 01:13:08,320
Hurry! I'll sell you South, I will!
I swear I will!

1095
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:11,929
Where's that Prissy?

1096
01:13:14,537 --> 01:13:16,562
This room's like an oven already...

1097
01:13:16,906 --> 01:13:18,840
...and it isn't noon yet.

1098
01:13:21,678 --> 01:13:23,475
Oh, don't worry, Melly.

1099
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,743
Mother says it always seems
like the doctor'll never come.

1100
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:31,348
If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!

1101
01:13:38,928 --> 01:13:40,156
Oh, Melly.

1102
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,457
You know what I heard
about Maybelle Merriwether?

1103
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:45,728
You remember that funny-looking beau
of hers?

1104
01:13:45,802 --> 01:13:48,965
The one with a uniform
like ladies' red flannel underdrawers.

1105
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:52,732
You don't have to keep on talking
for my sake, Scarlett.

1106
01:13:52,976 --> 01:13:54,944
I know how worried you are.

1107
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:11,854
Oh, Melly, I'll just go and fetch you
some cooler water.

1108
01:14:13,563 --> 01:14:15,053
You're as slow as molasses in January.

1109
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,428
And where's Dr. Meade?

1110
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:19,066
-I ain't never seen him, Miss Scarlett.
-What?

1111
01:14:19,135 --> 01:14:21,501
No, ma'am. He ain't at the hospital.

1112
01:14:21,571 --> 01:14:26,440
A man, he told me the doctor's down
at the car shed with the wounded soldiers--

1113
01:14:26,609 --> 01:14:28,975
Well, why didn't you go after him?

1114
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:30,439
Miss Scarlett.

1115
01:14:30,613 --> 01:14:33,514
I's scared to go down there to the car shed.

1116
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:37,886
There's folks dyin' down there
and I's scared of dead folks.

1117
01:14:40,023 --> 01:14:41,615
Oh, you go sit by Miss Melly.

1118
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,919
And don't you be upsetting her,
or I'll whip the hide off you!

1119
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:26,093
-Have you seen Dr. Meade?
-One side, lady, please.

1120
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:31,370
Dr. Meade!

1121
01:16:16,018 --> 01:16:17,349
Dr. Meade! At last!

1122
01:16:17,887 --> 01:16:21,084
Oh, thank heavens you're here.
I need every pair of hands.

1123
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:24,317
Come, child! Wake up!
We've got work to do.

1124
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:27,826
But Melly's having her baby.
You've got to come with me!

1125
01:16:28,164 --> 01:16:30,826
Are you crazy?
I can't leave these men for a baby!

1126
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,933
They're dyin', hundreds of them!
Get some woman to help you.

1127
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:37,097
But there isn't anybody.
And, Dr. Meade, she might die!

1128
01:16:37,273 --> 01:16:38,240
Die!

1129
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:41,037
Look at them!
Bleeding to death in front of my eyes!

1130
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:45,508
No chloroform! No bandages!
Nothing! Nothing to even ease their pain!

1131
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:48,109
Now run along and don't bother me.

1132
01:16:48,384 --> 01:16:51,512
Now don't worry, child.
There's nothing to bringing a baby.

1133
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:53,253
Now bring those stretchers in here!

1134
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:54,254
Dr. Meade!

1135
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:55,881
Here. I'm coming.

1136
01:17:15,144 --> 01:17:16,702
Is the doctor come?

1137
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:18,608
No, he can't come.

1138
01:17:18,848 --> 01:17:21,646
Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.

1139
01:17:21,784 --> 01:17:24,378
He can't come. There's nobody to come.

1140
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:28,386
Prissy, you've got to manage
without the doctor. I'll help you.

1141
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:30,488
Oh, lordy, Miss Scarlett.

1142
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:32,820
Well, what is it?

1143
01:17:33,062 --> 01:17:35,326
Lordy, we've got to have a doctor.

1144
01:17:35,398 --> 01:17:37,525
I don't know nothin' about birthin' babies.

1145
01:17:39,569 --> 01:17:41,400
-What do you mean?
-I don't know--

1146
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:43,233
You told me you knew everything about it.

1147
01:17:43,306 --> 01:17:45,433
I don't know how come I tell such a lie.

1148
01:17:45,508 --> 01:17:49,205
Ma ain't never let me 'round
when folks was havin' them.

1149
01:17:49,412 --> 01:17:50,504
Scarlett!

1150
01:17:51,147 --> 01:17:52,273
Scarlett!

1151
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:54,779
Oh, Miss Scarlett....

1152
01:17:55,451 --> 01:17:57,214
Stop it!

1153
01:17:58,187 --> 01:17:59,654
Go light a fire in the stove!

1154
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:02,691
Keep boiling water in the kettle,
get me a ball of twine and...

1155
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:05,158
...and all the clean towels you can find,
and the scissors.

1156
01:18:05,228 --> 01:18:06,923
Don't come telling me you can't find them.

1157
01:18:06,996 --> 01:18:09,157
Go get them, and get them quick!

1158
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,658
Scarlett!

1159
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,441
Coming, Melly.

1160
01:18:23,546 --> 01:18:24,604
Coming.

1161
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,882
Go, Scarlett, before the Yankees get here.

1162
01:18:30,953 --> 01:18:32,944
I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.

1163
01:18:33,022 --> 01:18:34,717
It's no use. I'm going to die.

1164
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,782
Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me.
Hold on to me.

1165
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,255
Talk to me, Scarlett.

1166
01:18:40,329 --> 01:18:42,456
Please talk to me.

1167
01:18:42,698 --> 01:18:43,926
Don't try to be brave, Melly.

1168
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,264
Yell all you want to,
there's nobody to hear.

1169
01:18:46,469 --> 01:18:50,906
Ma says that if you puts a knife
under the bed it cuts the pain in two.

1170
01:18:56,212 --> 01:18:57,975
Cap'n Butler!

1171
01:18:58,848 --> 01:19:00,145
Cap'n Butler!

1172
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:02,941
What do you want?

1173
01:19:03,019 --> 01:19:03,986
Cap'n Butler.

1174
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:06,715
He's upstairs. Belle Watlin's givin' a party.

1175
01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:10,185
Thank you.

1176
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:14,962
Cap'n Butler! Oh, Cap'n Butler!

1177
01:19:15,197 --> 01:19:17,256
What's all the rumpus about?

1178
01:19:17,433 --> 01:19:20,630
I's got a message for Cap'n Butler,
Miss Watlin'!

1179
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:23,828
Cap'n Butler, you come out here
in the streets to me.

1180
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,608
What is it, Prissy?

1181
01:19:26,676 --> 01:19:29,167
Miss Scarlett, she done sent me for you.

1182
01:19:29,345 --> 01:19:32,075
Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.

1183
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:35,482
And a fine baby boy...

1184
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:38,715
...and Miss Scarlett and me, we brung him.

1185
01:19:38,921 --> 01:19:40,252
Do you mean to tell me that Scarlett--

1186
01:19:40,323 --> 01:19:44,123
Well, it was mostly me, Cap'n Butler,
only Miss Scarlett...

1187
01:19:44,193 --> 01:19:49,062
...she helped me a little, but I don't expect
no doctor could have done no better!

1188
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:53,495
Only Miss Melly, she feelin' kinda poorly
now it's all over!

1189
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:55,932
Yes, I can believe that!

1190
01:19:56,005 --> 01:19:59,600
And the Yankees is comin'
and Miss Scarlett she said....

1191
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:03,640
Oh, Cap'n Butler, the Yankees is here!

1192
01:20:04,313 --> 01:20:07,578
Please come and bring your carriage
for us right away.

1193
01:20:07,717 --> 01:20:10,777
I'm sorry, Prissy, but the Army took
my horse and carriage.

1194
01:20:10,986 --> 01:20:12,920
You'd better come upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.

1195
01:20:12,988 --> 01:20:14,546
Oh, no, Cap'n Butler!

1196
01:20:14,824 --> 01:20:19,625
My ma would wear me out with a cornstalk
if I was to go into Miss Watlin's.

1197
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:24,359
Any of you beauties know where I can steal
a horse for a good cause?

1198
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:34,106
-Whoa, Marse Robert.
-Is that you, Rhett?

1199
01:20:34,377 --> 01:20:37,608
-We's here, Miss Scarlett. We's here!
-Rhett, I knew you'd come.

1200
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,477
Good evening. Nice weather we're having.

1201
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:40,845
Prissy tells me you're planning
on taking a trip.

1202
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:43,407
If you make any jokes now I'll kill you!

1203
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:44,811
Don't tell me you're frightened.

1204
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:48,482
I'm scared to death. If you had the sense
of a goat, you'd be scared too.

1205
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:50,250
Oh, the Yankees.

1206
01:20:50,326 --> 01:20:51,293
No, not yet.

1207
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,692
That's what's left of our Army,
blowing up the ammunition...

1208
01:20:53,763 --> 01:20:54,821
...so the Yankees won't get it.

1209
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:56,922
We've got to get out of here.

1210
01:20:56,999 --> 01:20:57,988
At your service, Madam.

1211
01:20:58,067 --> 01:20:59,557
Just where are you figuring on going?

1212
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:00,659
Home, to Tara.

1213
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:03,330
Don't you know that they've been fighting
all day around Tara?

1214
01:21:03,406 --> 01:21:05,306
Do you think you can parade through
the Yankee Army...

1215
01:21:05,374 --> 01:21:08,104
...with a sick woman,
a baby and a simple-minded darky...

1216
01:21:08,177 --> 01:21:09,838
...or do you intend leaving them behind?

1217
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:12,073
They're going with me and I'm going home
and you can't stop me!

1218
01:21:12,148 --> 01:21:16,141
Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing
Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?

1219
01:21:16,218 --> 01:21:17,651
I want my mother!

1220
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:20,881
I want to go home to Tara!

1221
01:21:20,956 --> 01:21:22,514
Tara's probably been burned to the ground.

1222
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,218
The woods are full of stragglers
from both armies.

1223
01:21:24,293 --> 01:21:26,420
The least they'll do is take the horse
away from you...

1224
01:21:26,495 --> 01:21:27,894
...and even though it isn't
much of an animal...

1225
01:21:27,963 --> 01:21:29,396
...l did have a lot of trouble stealing it.

1226
01:21:29,465 --> 01:21:32,901
I'm going home if I have to walk
every step of the way.

1227
01:21:32,968 --> 01:21:36,165
I'll kill you if you try to stop me.
I will, I will!

1228
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:37,764
I will!

1229
01:21:43,579 --> 01:21:47,106
All right, darling, all right.
Now you shall go home.

1230
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:52,442
I guess anybody who did what you've done
today can take care of Sherman.

1231
01:21:54,056 --> 01:21:56,388
Here, now. Stop crying.

1232
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:01,192
Now blow your nose like a good little girl.

1233
01:22:01,464 --> 01:22:02,453
There.

1234
01:22:14,343 --> 01:22:15,435
Prissy! What are you doing?

1235
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:16,944
I's packin', Miss Scarlett.

1236
01:22:17,012 --> 01:22:18,479
Stop it and come get the baby.

1237
01:22:18,681 --> 01:22:19,670
Yes, ma'am.

1238
01:22:22,318 --> 01:22:23,444
Melly!

1239
01:22:24,453 --> 01:22:27,286
Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.

1240
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:28,588
Tara....

1241
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:30,522
-It's the only way, Melly.
-No.

1242
01:22:30,593 --> 01:22:33,323
Sherman will burn the house
over our heads if we stay.

1243
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:35,029
It's all right, Melly.

1244
01:22:35,097 --> 01:22:36,655
My baby.

1245
01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:38,790
My poor baby.

1246
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:45,565
Have you the strength to put your arms
around my neck?

1247
01:22:45,641 --> 01:22:47,404
I think so.

1248
01:22:50,412 --> 01:22:51,538
Never mind.

1249
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:54,113
Oh, Ashley, Charles....

1250
01:22:54,183 --> 01:22:55,775
What is it? What does she want?

1251
01:22:55,851 --> 01:22:58,615
Ashley's picture, Charles' sword.
She wants us to bring them.

1252
01:22:58,687 --> 01:22:59,654
Get them.

1253
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:16,796
What's that?

1254
01:23:17,373 --> 01:23:20,604
Our gallant lads must have set fire
to the warehouses near the depot.

1255
01:23:20,676 --> 01:23:23,270
There's enough ammunition in the box cars
to blow us to Tara.

1256
01:23:23,345 --> 01:23:25,074
We'll have to hurry to get
across the tracks.

1257
01:23:25,147 --> 01:23:27,012
-You're not going that way!
-We have to.

1258
01:23:27,082 --> 01:23:30,245
The McDonough Road's the only one
the Yankees haven't cut yet.

1259
01:23:39,595 --> 01:23:42,029
Oh, wait. I forgot to lock the front door.

1260
01:23:42,164 --> 01:23:43,461
What are you laughing at?

1261
01:23:43,532 --> 01:23:45,659
At you, locking the Yankees out.

1262
01:24:02,718 --> 01:24:04,345
Oh, dear, I wish they'd hurry.

1263
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:07,150
I wouldn't be in such a hurry
to see them go if I were you.

1264
01:24:07,222 --> 01:24:09,690
With them goes the last semblance
of law and order.

1265
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:14,222
The scavengers aren't wasting any time.

1266
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:20,430
We've got to get out of here, fast.

1267
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:21,730
There's a horse!

1268
01:24:33,215 --> 01:24:34,876
Down the alley, cut them off.

1269
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:50,559
Give me that horse.

1270
01:25:00,743 --> 01:25:01,732
Miss Scarlett!

1271
01:25:06,682 --> 01:25:08,616
They haven't left much for the Yankees
to take, have they?

1272
01:25:08,684 --> 01:25:11,983
We'll have to make a dash for it
before the fire reaches that ammunition.

1273
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:34,531
Come on!

1274
01:25:39,014 --> 01:25:40,675
Throw me your shawl.

1275
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:46,549
Sorry, but you'll like it better
if you don't see anything.

1276
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:48,272
Take a good look, my dear.

1277
01:26:48,717 --> 01:26:49,741
It's a historic moment.

1278
01:26:49,818 --> 01:26:53,811
You can tell your grandchildren how you
watched the old South disappear one night.

1279
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:13,271
They were going to lick the Yankees
in a month.

1280
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,205
The poor gallant fools!

1281
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:16,675
They make me sick, all of them!

1282
01:27:16,745 --> 01:27:19,873
Getting us all into this
with their swaggering and boasting.

1283
01:27:20,215 --> 01:27:23,548
That's the way I felt once
about their swaggering and boasting.

1284
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:26,785
Rhett, I'm so glad you aren't
with the Army.

1285
01:27:26,855 --> 01:27:31,258
You can be proud, now, proud that you've
been smarter than all of them.

1286
01:27:33,529 --> 01:27:34,996
I'm not so proud.

1287
01:27:54,449 --> 01:27:55,507
Why did you stop?

1288
01:27:55,584 --> 01:27:58,314
This is the turn to Tara.
Let the horse breathe a bit.

1289
01:27:58,687 --> 01:27:59,676
Mrs. Wilkes.

1290
01:27:59,788 --> 01:28:03,087
Miss Melly done fainted way back,
Cap'n Butler.

1291
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:04,850
Well, she's probably better off.

1292
01:28:04,927 --> 01:28:07,987
She couldn't stand the pain
if she were conscious.

1293
01:28:08,497 --> 01:28:11,364
Scarlett, are you still determined to do
this crazy thing?

1294
01:28:11,433 --> 01:28:14,266
Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.
I'm sure we can.

1295
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,167
Not we, my dear, you.

1296
01:28:16,538 --> 01:28:18,005
I'm leaving you here.

1297
01:28:18,307 --> 01:28:20,901
You're what? Rhett, where are you going?

1298
01:28:21,143 --> 01:28:23,373
I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.

1299
01:28:23,579 --> 01:28:26,207
You're joking!
I could kill you for scaring me so!

1300
01:28:26,281 --> 01:28:27,873
I'm very serious, Scarlett.

1301
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:30,574
I'm going to join up
with our brave lads in gray.

1302
01:28:30,886 --> 01:28:32,012
But they're running away!

1303
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:35,545
No. They'll turn and make a last stand,
if I know anything about them.

1304
01:28:35,624 --> 01:28:38,286
When they do, I'll be with them.
A little late, but "Better late--"

1305
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,089
Rhett, you must be joking!

1306
01:28:41,496 --> 01:28:43,054
Selfish to the end, aren't you?

1307
01:28:43,232 --> 01:28:46,861
Thinking only of your own precious hide,
with never a thought for the noble cause.

1308
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:48,766
Rhett, how could you do this to me...

1309
01:28:48,837 --> 01:28:51,772
...and why should you go now,
after it's all over and I need you?

1310
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,864
Why? Why?

1311
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:53,908
Why?

1312
01:28:53,976 --> 01:28:56,536
Maybe it's because I've always had
a weakness for lost causes...

1313
01:28:56,612 --> 01:28:58,170
...once they're really lost.

1314
01:28:58,447 --> 01:28:59,539
Or maybe...

1315
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:02,807
...maybe I'm ashamed of myself.

1316
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:05,041
Who knows?

1317
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,987
You should die of shame
to leave me here alone and helpless!

1318
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:09,348
You helpless?

1319
01:29:10,826 --> 01:29:13,590
Heaven help the Yankees
if they capture you!

1320
01:29:14,129 --> 01:29:17,189
Now, climb down here.
I want to say goodbye.

1321
01:29:17,532 --> 01:29:18,521
No!

1322
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:20,192
Climb down.

1323
01:29:23,872 --> 01:29:27,035
Oh, Rhett, please don't go.
You can't leave me, please.

1324
01:29:27,276 --> 01:29:29,005
I'll never forgive you!

1325
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:32,877
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I'll never understand or forgive myself.

1326
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:37,618
And if a bullet gets me, so help me,
I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.

1327
01:29:37,853 --> 01:29:39,753
But there's one thing I do know...

1328
01:29:39,821 --> 01:29:41,482
...and that is that I love you, Scarlett.

1329
01:29:41,556 --> 01:29:44,548
In spite of you and me and the whole
silly world going to pieces around us...

1330
01:29:44,626 --> 01:29:45,854
...l love you...

1331
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:48,486
...because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.

1332
01:29:48,897 --> 01:29:50,364
Selfish and shrewd...

1333
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:54,259
...but able to look things in the eyes
and call them by their right names.

1334
01:29:54,336 --> 01:29:56,236
Don't hold me like that!

1335
01:29:56,471 --> 01:29:58,302
Scarlett, look at me.

1336
01:29:59,474 --> 01:30:01,908
I love you more
than I've ever loved any woman.

1337
01:30:02,044 --> 01:30:05,275
And I've waited longer for you
than I've ever waited for any woman.

1338
01:30:05,347 --> 01:30:06,541
Let me alone!

1339
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:10,282
Here's a soldier of the South
who loves you, Scarlett...

1340
01:30:10,352 --> 01:30:11,842
...wants to feel your arms around him...

1341
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,821
...wants to carry the memory
of your kisses into battle with him.

1342
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,414
Never mind about loving me.

1343
01:30:16,658 --> 01:30:20,424
You're a woman sending a soldier
to his death with a beautiful memory.

1344
01:30:20,696 --> 01:30:22,493
Scarlett, kiss me.

1345
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:24,997
Kiss me, once.

1346
01:30:30,339 --> 01:30:32,807
You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!

1347
01:30:33,108 --> 01:30:36,441
They were right! Everybody was right!
You aren't a gentleman!

1348
01:30:39,614 --> 01:30:41,775
A minor point at such a moment.

1349
01:30:43,652 --> 01:30:44,744
Here.

1350
01:30:45,387 --> 01:30:47,685
If anyone lays a hand on that nag,
shoot him.

1351
01:30:47,756 --> 01:30:49,690
But don't make a mistake
and shoot the nag.

1352
01:30:49,758 --> 01:30:53,888
Oh, go on. I want you to go.
I hope a cannon ball lands slap on you.

1353
01:30:53,962 --> 01:30:55,486
I hope you're blown into a million pieces!

1354
01:30:55,564 --> 01:30:58,727
Never mind the rest.
I follow your general idea.

1355
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,893
And when I'm dead on the altar
of my country...

1356
01:31:00,969 --> 01:31:03,301
...l hope your conscience hurts you.

1357
01:31:03,872 --> 01:31:05,305
Goodbye, Scarlett.

1358
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:33,927
Come on, you! We're going home.

1359
01:32:49,678 --> 01:32:51,669
Oh, my poor baby.

1360
01:32:53,582 --> 01:32:55,015
Don't worry, Melly.

1361
01:32:55,317 --> 01:32:57,376
Mother'll take care of him
when we get home.

1362
01:32:57,452 --> 01:33:00,250
Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.

1363
01:33:00,489 --> 01:33:02,286
We's got to have something to eat.

1364
01:33:02,357 --> 01:33:03,381
Oh, hush up!

1365
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:06,951
We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.
We'll stop there.

1366
01:33:07,796 --> 01:33:08,785
Go on!

1367
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:19,056
Ashley, I'm glad you're not here to see this.

1368
01:34:20,368 --> 01:34:22,063
The Yankees!

1369
01:34:22,137 --> 01:34:24,071
The dirty Yankees!

1370
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,211
Prissy, come tie up this cow!

1371
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:44,089
We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.

1372
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:47,219
We'll be home soon, and I's scared of cows.

1373
01:34:47,829 --> 01:34:50,855
Tear up your petticoat and tie her
on to the back of the wagon.

1374
01:34:51,099 --> 01:34:54,728
We need milk for the baby, and
we don't know what we'll find at home.

1375
01:35:03,979 --> 01:35:05,970
Melly! Melly, we're home!

1376
01:35:06,181 --> 01:35:07,205
We're at Tara!

1377
01:35:07,282 --> 01:35:09,147
Hurry! Move, you brute!

1378
01:35:10,752 --> 01:35:13,186
Miss Scarlett, he's dead!

1379
01:35:13,488 --> 01:35:17,754
I can't see the house! ls it there?
I can't see the house. Have they burned it?

1380
01:35:21,663 --> 01:35:23,290
Oh, it's all right.

1381
01:35:23,365 --> 01:35:25,697
It's all right! They haven't burned it!

1382
01:35:26,034 --> 01:35:27,365
It's still there!

1383
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:33,599
Mother! Mother! Pa!

1384
01:35:36,344 --> 01:35:38,005
Mother! Mother! Pa!

1385
01:35:43,852 --> 01:35:46,787
Mother, let me in. It's me, Scarlett!

1386
01:35:51,293 --> 01:35:52,260
Pa!

1387
01:35:53,028 --> 01:35:54,495
Oh, Pa!

1388
01:35:55,230 --> 01:35:56,561
I'm home!

1389
01:35:58,066 --> 01:35:59,158
I'm home!

1390
01:36:02,237 --> 01:36:03,636
Katie.

1391
01:36:04,406 --> 01:36:05,930
Katie Scarlett.

1392
01:36:06,908 --> 01:36:08,705
Oh, darlin'.

1393
01:36:19,888 --> 01:36:20,855
Mammy!

1394
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:25,593
-Mammy, I'm home.
-Honey, honey child!

1395
01:36:27,395 --> 01:36:29,488
Oh, Mammy, I'm so....

1396
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:32,224
Where's Mother?

1397
01:36:33,201 --> 01:36:34,168
Why...

1398
01:36:34,803 --> 01:36:38,398
...Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen,
they was sick with the typhoid.

1399
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,973
They had it bad,
but they's doin' all right now.

1400
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:43,777
Just weak like little kittens.

1401
01:36:43,845 --> 01:36:45,813
But where's Mother?

1402
01:36:47,515 --> 01:36:48,641
Well...

1403
01:36:49,217 --> 01:36:54,120
...Miss Ellen, she went down to nurse
that Emmy Slattery, that white trash...

1404
01:36:54,823 --> 01:36:56,848
...and she took down with it, too.

1405
01:36:59,194 --> 01:37:01,355
-And last night she....
-Mother!

1406
01:37:05,233 --> 01:37:06,461
Mother.

1407
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:15,699
Miss Scarlett, honey.

1408
01:38:15,937 --> 01:38:18,667
If there's anythin' I can do, Miss Scarlett....

1409
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:21,168
What did you do with Miss Melly?

1410
01:38:21,242 --> 01:38:23,574
Don't you worry your pretty head
'bout Miss Melly, child.

1411
01:38:23,645 --> 01:38:26,512
I done slapped her in bed already,
along with the baby.

1412
01:38:26,714 --> 01:38:29,182
You better put that cow I brought
into the barn, Pork.

1413
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,548
There ain't no barn no more, Miss Scarlett.

1414
01:38:31,653 --> 01:38:33,587
The Yankees done burned it for firewood.

1415
01:38:33,655 --> 01:38:35,782
They used the house for their headquarters.

1416
01:38:35,857 --> 01:38:37,518
They camped all around the place.

1417
01:38:37,592 --> 01:38:38,820
Yankees in Tara!

1418
01:38:39,127 --> 01:38:41,925
Yes, ma'am, and they stole most everythin'
they didn't burn.

1419
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:46,191
All the clothes and all the rugs
and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.

1420
01:38:48,536 --> 01:38:50,401
I'm starving, Pork.
Get me something to eat.

1421
01:38:50,472 --> 01:38:53,669
There ain't nothin' to eat, honey.
They took it all.

1422
01:38:54,008 --> 01:38:55,566
All the chickens, everything?

1423
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:57,337
They took them the first thing.

1424
01:38:57,612 --> 01:39:00,410
And what they didn't eat
they carried off across their saddles.

1425
01:39:00,482 --> 01:39:03,246
Don't tell me any more
about what they did!

1426
01:39:19,133 --> 01:39:21,124
What's this, Pa?

1427
01:39:21,202 --> 01:39:22,294
Whiskey?

1428
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:24,032
Yes, daughter.

1429
01:39:27,909 --> 01:39:29,934
Here, Katie Scarlett, that's enough!

1430
01:39:30,278 --> 01:39:33,406
You're not knowing spirits,
you'll make yourself tipsy.

1431
01:39:33,615 --> 01:39:35,515
I hope it makes me drunk.

1432
01:39:35,884 --> 01:39:37,476
I'd like to be drunk.

1433
01:39:40,622 --> 01:39:41,611
Oh, Pa.

1434
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:46,524
What are those papers?

1435
01:39:47,996 --> 01:39:49,122
Bonds.

1436
01:39:50,899 --> 01:39:52,526
They're all we've saved.

1437
01:39:52,767 --> 01:39:54,359
All we have left.

1438
01:39:54,903 --> 01:39:56,097
Bonds.

1439
01:39:56,504 --> 01:39:58,233
What kind of bonds, Pa?

1440
01:39:59,307 --> 01:40:01,867
Why, Confederate bonds,
of course, daughter.

1441
01:40:02,043 --> 01:40:03,374
Confederate bonds?

1442
01:40:04,012 --> 01:40:05,741
What good are they to anybody?

1443
01:40:06,414 --> 01:40:09,076
I'll not have you talking like that,
Katie Scarlett.

1444
01:40:09,284 --> 01:40:13,345
Oh, Pa, what are we going to do
with no money and nothing to eat?

1445
01:40:14,822 --> 01:40:16,380
We must ask your mother.

1446
01:40:17,525 --> 01:40:18,856
That's it!

1447
01:40:19,294 --> 01:40:21,524
We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.

1448
01:40:23,031 --> 01:40:24,760
-Ask Mother?
-Yes.

1449
01:40:25,667 --> 01:40:28,227
Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.

1450
01:40:29,337 --> 01:40:31,100
Now don't be botherin' me.

1451
01:40:31,306 --> 01:40:33,069
Go out for a ride.

1452
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:34,766
I'm busy.

1453
01:40:52,961 --> 01:40:54,519
Oh, Pa...

1454
01:40:55,263 --> 01:40:56,992
...don't worry about anything.

1455
01:40:58,166 --> 01:40:59,565
Katie Scarlett's home.

1456
01:41:02,437 --> 01:41:03,665
You needn't worry.

1457
01:41:19,287 --> 01:41:20,254
Miss Scarlett.

1458
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:24,257
What are we gonna to do with nothin'
to feed those sick folks and that child?

1459
01:41:25,793 --> 01:41:27,385
I don't know, Mammy.

1460
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:29,355
I don't know.

1461
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:32,365
We ain't got nothin' but radishes
in the garden.

1462
01:41:32,567 --> 01:41:35,502
Miss Scarlett,
Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...

1463
01:41:35,703 --> 01:41:38,069
...they's fussin' to be sponged off.

1464
01:41:38,873 --> 01:41:40,306
Where are the other servants, Mammy?

1465
01:41:40,375 --> 01:41:42,969
Miss Scarlett, there's only
just me and Pork left.

1466
01:41:43,044 --> 01:41:45,308
The others went off to the war
or runned away.

1467
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:48,611
I can't take care of that baby
and sick folks, too.

1468
01:41:49,484 --> 01:41:51,247
I's only got two hands.

1469
01:41:51,686 --> 01:41:56,055
Who's going to milk that cow,
Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.

1470
01:43:19,073 --> 01:43:20,836
As God is my witness....

1471
01:43:21,642 --> 01:43:25,078
As God is my witness,
they're not going to lick me.

1472
01:43:25,379 --> 01:43:30,248
I'm going to live through this, and when
it's all over, I'll never be hungry again.

1473
01:43:30,618 --> 01:43:32,279
No, nor any of my folks.

1474
01:43:33,855 --> 01:43:36,415
If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill.

1475
01:43:37,725 --> 01:43:41,593
As God is my witness,
I'll never be hungry again!

1476
01:50:50,703 --> 01:50:52,796
My back's near broken.

1477
01:50:55,408 --> 01:50:57,137
Look at my hands.

1478
01:50:57,843 --> 01:51:01,006
Mother said you could always tell a lady
by her hands.

1479
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:05,416
I guess things like hands and ladies
don't matter so much anymore.

1480
01:51:06,285 --> 01:51:10,085
You rest, Sue, you're not well yet,
and I can pick cotton for both of us.

1481
01:51:10,289 --> 01:51:13,884
Scarlett's hateful, making us work
in the fields like--

1482
01:51:13,993 --> 01:51:15,722
Too bad about that.

1483
01:51:16,195 --> 01:51:19,062
Now get back to work.
I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.

1484
01:51:19,131 --> 01:51:21,725
What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!

1485
01:51:25,171 --> 01:51:28,106
Don't you ever dare say
you hate Tara again!

1486
01:51:28,974 --> 01:51:31,340
The same as hating Pa and Ma.

1487
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:41,313
Katie Scarlett, there's something
I must speak to you about.

1488
01:51:41,387 --> 01:51:42,354
Yes, Pa, what is it?

1489
01:51:42,421 --> 01:51:46,050
I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.
I don't like the way you're treating them.

1490
01:51:46,125 --> 01:51:49,526
You must be firm with inferiors
but you must be gentle with them...

1491
01:51:49,695 --> 01:51:51,128
...especially darkies.

1492
01:51:51,197 --> 01:51:55,065
Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them
to do anything I'm not doing myself.

1493
01:51:55,134 --> 01:51:59,468
Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it.
I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.

1494
01:52:14,687 --> 01:52:16,211
What are you doing out of bed, Melly?

1495
01:52:16,288 --> 01:52:19,485
Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.
You are all working so hard.

1496
01:52:19,558 --> 01:52:21,253
I can't lie in bed doing nothing.

1497
01:52:21,327 --> 01:52:23,852
Go on back upstairs.
You're as weak as a newborn colt.

1498
01:52:23,929 --> 01:52:25,191
Please, Scarlett, let me.

1499
01:52:25,264 --> 01:52:27,391
Stop being noble.
I've got enough on my hands...

1500
01:52:27,466 --> 01:52:30,333
...without you making yourself sick
so you'll never be any use.

1501
01:52:30,603 --> 01:52:33,128
Oh, I didn't think of it that way.

1502
01:53:28,828 --> 01:53:31,422
Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot!

1503
01:53:37,736 --> 01:53:39,670
You all alone, little lady?

1504
01:53:42,508 --> 01:53:44,874
You ain't very friendly, are you?

1505
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:50,678
You got anything else
besides these earbobs?

1506
01:53:50,749 --> 01:53:53,274
You Yankees have been here before.

1507
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:56,080
Regular little spitfire, ain't you?

1508
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,590
What have you got hidden in your hand?

1509
01:54:35,094 --> 01:54:37,062
Scarlett, you killed him!

1510
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:40,095
I'm glad you killed him!

1511
01:54:41,267 --> 01:54:44,668
Scarlett! Scarlett, what happened?
What is it, Scarlett? What is it?

1512
01:54:49,074 --> 01:54:52,202
Don't be scared, chickens.
Your sister was cleaning a revolver and...

1513
01:54:52,278 --> 01:54:54,746
...it went off and nearly scared her
to death.

1514
01:54:55,014 --> 01:54:58,142
Oh, thank goodness.
Haven't we got enough to frighten us?

1515
01:54:58,317 --> 01:55:00,877
Tell Katie Scarlett
she must be more careful.

1516
01:55:04,089 --> 01:55:06,387
What a cool liar you are, Melly.

1517
01:55:07,026 --> 01:55:09,290
We've got to get him out of here
and bury him.

1518
01:55:09,361 --> 01:55:11,022
If the Yankees find him here, they'll....

1519
01:55:11,096 --> 01:55:14,532
I didn't see anyone else.
I think he must be a deserter.

1520
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,227
But, even so, we've got to hide him.

1521
01:55:16,302 --> 01:55:20,068
They might hear about it,
and then they'd come and get you.

1522
01:55:22,975 --> 01:55:25,603
I could bury him in the arbor
where the ground is soft...

1523
01:55:25,678 --> 01:55:28,146
...but how will I get him out of here?

1524
01:55:28,847 --> 01:55:30,405
We'll both take a leg and drag him.

1525
01:55:30,482 --> 01:55:32,245
You couldn't drag a cat.

1526
01:55:39,058 --> 01:55:42,391
Do you think it would be dishonest
if we went through his haversack?

1527
01:55:42,461 --> 01:55:44,622
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.

1528
01:55:44,997 --> 01:55:47,830
You take the haversack,
I'll search his pockets.

1529
01:56:00,045 --> 01:56:01,103
You look.

1530
01:56:01,714 --> 01:56:03,272
I'm feeling a little weak.

1531
01:56:03,549 --> 01:56:06,143
Melly, I think it's full of money!

1532
01:56:06,986 --> 01:56:08,578
Oh, Melly, look!

1533
01:56:08,654 --> 01:56:09,678
Look!

1534
01:56:10,389 --> 01:56:11,481
Ten, $20, $30, $40....

1535
01:56:11,557 --> 01:56:13,718
Don't stop to count it now.
We haven't got time.

1536
01:56:13,959 --> 01:56:16,189
Do you realize this means
we'll have something to eat?

1537
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:18,092
Look in his other pockets.

1538
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:21,632
Hurry, hurry!

1539
01:56:21,834 --> 01:56:24,200
-We've got to get him out of here.
-Here.

1540
01:56:37,483 --> 01:56:39,815
If he bleeds across the yard,
we can't hide it.

1541
01:56:40,452 --> 01:56:43,421
Give me your nightgown, Melly.
I'll wad it around his head.

1542
01:56:43,489 --> 01:56:45,081
Don't be silly. I won't look at you.

1543
01:56:45,157 --> 01:56:47,819
If I had a petticoat or pantalettes,
I'd use them.

1544
01:57:02,074 --> 01:57:04,372
Thank heavens I'm not that modest.

1545
01:57:05,377 --> 01:57:07,811
Now go back to bed.
You'll be dead if you don't.

1546
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:10,141
I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him.

1547
01:57:10,716 --> 01:57:12,877
No, I'll clean it up.

1548
01:57:16,255 --> 01:57:18,018
Well, I guess I've done murder.

1549
01:57:20,125 --> 01:57:22,150
I won't think about that now.

1550
01:57:22,628 --> 01:57:24,755
I'll think about that tomorrow.

1551
01:57:33,906 --> 01:57:35,066
Katie Scarlett!

1552
01:57:36,375 --> 01:57:37,569
Katie Scarlett!

1553
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:40,008
It's over! It's over!

1554
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:42,945
It's all over! The war!

1555
01:57:43,015 --> 01:57:44,414
Lee surrendered!

1556
01:57:44,616 --> 01:57:46,948
-It's not possible.
-Oh, why did we ever fight?

1557
01:57:47,286 --> 01:57:49,049
Ashley will be coming home.

1558
01:57:49,421 --> 01:57:51,150
Yes, Ashley'll be coming home.

1559
01:57:51,724 --> 01:57:53,351
We'll plant more cotton.

1560
01:57:53,425 --> 01:57:55,552
Cotton ought to go sky-high next year!

1561
01:58:11,076 --> 01:58:14,045
"While we were marching through Georgia.

1562
01:58:14,313 --> 01:58:15,974
"Hurrah, hurrah!

1563
01:58:16,048 --> 01:58:17,709
"We bring the jubilee.

1564
01:58:17,783 --> 01:58:19,341
"Hurrah, hurrah!

1565
01:58:19,418 --> 01:58:21,113
"The flag that makes you free.

1566
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:24,346
"So we sing the chorus
from Atlanta to the sea.

1567
01:58:24,656 --> 01:58:28,148
"While we were marching
through Georgia."

1568
01:58:28,393 --> 01:58:30,588
Get out of the road, rebel!
Get out of the way!

1569
01:58:30,662 --> 01:58:32,823
Have you room in your carriage
for a dyin' man?

1570
01:58:32,898 --> 01:58:35,594
I got no room for any Southern scum,
alive or dead.

1571
01:58:35,667 --> 01:58:36,861
Get out of the way!

1572
01:58:37,136 --> 01:58:39,468
I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.

1573
01:58:39,738 --> 01:58:42,366
Giddap! Jump, you gray-backed beggars!

1574
01:58:42,508 --> 01:58:44,806
Act like they won the war!

1575
01:58:45,077 --> 01:58:47,807
Now you come on and give me them pants,
Mist' Kennedy.

1576
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:48,938
Come on.

1577
01:58:51,216 --> 01:58:54,674
You scrub yourself with that strong
lye soap before I scrubs you myself.

1578
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:57,880
I'm gonna put these britches
in the boilin' pot.

1579
01:59:00,592 --> 01:59:03,026
The whole Confederate Army's got
the same trouble...

1580
01:59:03,095 --> 01:59:05,154
...crawlin' clothes and dysentery.

1581
01:59:06,064 --> 01:59:07,964
It's humiliating how you treat Mr. Kennedy.

1582
01:59:08,033 --> 01:59:11,628
You'd be a sight more humiliated
if Mist' Kennedy's lice gets on you!

1583
01:59:13,906 --> 01:59:15,168
Come on, Beau.

1584
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:19,071
We must leave this gentleman alone
because he's tired and he's hungry.

1585
01:59:20,012 --> 01:59:22,708
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again.

1586
01:59:22,948 --> 01:59:24,210
Nice little fellow.

1587
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:28,147
Another two years of war and we could
have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.

1588
01:59:29,021 --> 01:59:30,511
Were you in Cobb's Legion?

1589
01:59:30,589 --> 01:59:31,817
Yes, ma'am.

1590
01:59:31,957 --> 01:59:35,188
Why, then, you must know my husband,
Major Wilkes.

1591
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:36,557
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1592
01:59:36,795 --> 01:59:39,059
He was captured at Spottsylvania, I think.

1593
01:59:39,331 --> 01:59:40,559
Captured!

1594
01:59:41,433 --> 01:59:43,367
Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't....

1595
01:59:43,769 --> 01:59:45,964
Oh, my poor Ashley! ln a Yankee prison!

1596
01:59:46,505 --> 01:59:47,733
Melanie!

1597
01:59:47,906 --> 01:59:50,704
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.

1598
01:59:50,943 --> 01:59:53,002
I'll watch out for him, ma'am.
We're good friends.

1599
01:59:53,078 --> 01:59:54,568
Oh, thank you.

1600
01:59:59,151 --> 02:00:02,416
I slave day and night so we can have
food to keep body and soul together.

1601
02:00:02,521 --> 02:00:05,081
And you give it all away
to these starving scarecrows.

1602
02:00:05,157 --> 02:00:06,988
I'd rather a plague of locusts around here.

1603
02:00:07,059 --> 02:00:09,027
Don't scold me, Scarlett, please.

1604
02:00:09,094 --> 02:00:11,688
I've just heard
that Ashley was taken prisoner.

1605
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:13,488
-Ashley, a prisoner!
-Yes.

1606
02:00:13,699 --> 02:00:17,897
And maybe if he's alive and well
he's on some Northern road right now.

1607
02:00:18,337 --> 02:00:21,500
And maybe some Northern woman
is giving him a share of her dinner...

1608
02:00:21,573 --> 02:00:24,633
...and helping my beloved
to come back home to me.

1609
02:00:26,578 --> 02:00:27,704
I hope so, Melly.

1610
02:00:27,813 --> 02:00:28,802
Miss Scarlett.

1611
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:35,881
Miss Scarlett, I wanted to take up
something with your pa but...

1612
02:00:36,188 --> 02:00:37,246
...he doesn't seem to....

1613
02:00:37,322 --> 02:00:39,813
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now.

1614
02:00:40,025 --> 02:00:41,686
Well, l, l....

1615
02:00:42,261 --> 02:00:44,889
Miss Scarlett, I was aimin' to ask
for Suellen.

1616
02:00:45,998 --> 02:00:48,228
Do you mean to tell me
you haven't asked for her...

1617
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,495
...after all these years
she's been counting on you?

1618
02:00:50,569 --> 02:00:54,335
Well, l, the truth is,
I'm so much older than she is, and....

1619
02:00:54,473 --> 02:00:56,600
Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.

1620
02:00:56,742 --> 02:00:57,936
Who has nowadays?

1621
02:00:58,543 --> 02:01:01,478
Miss Scarlett, if true love carries
any weight with you...

1622
02:01:01,546 --> 02:01:04,174
...you can be sure your sister
will be rich in that.

1623
02:01:04,516 --> 02:01:07,815
I'll go out somewhere and get myself
a little business if we're engaged.

1624
02:01:07,953 --> 02:01:09,511
As soon as I get on my feet again--

1625
02:01:09,588 --> 02:01:11,988
All right, Frank.
I'm sure I can speak for Pa.

1626
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:13,352
You go ask her now.

1627
02:01:14,359 --> 02:01:16,691
Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

1628
02:01:19,932 --> 02:01:21,957
Excuse me, excuse me.

1629
02:01:24,703 --> 02:01:27,467
Scarlett, what seems to be
the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?

1630
02:01:27,739 --> 02:01:29,673
More trouble than he guesses.

1631
02:01:29,741 --> 02:01:31,641
He has finally asked for Suellen's hand.

1632
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:33,109
Oh, I'm so glad.

1633
02:01:33,378 --> 02:01:37,542
It's a pity he can't marry her now.
At least, there'd be one less mouth to feed.

1634
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:42,944
Oh, another one.

1635
02:01:43,522 --> 02:01:44,853
I hope this one isn't hungry.

1636
02:01:44,923 --> 02:01:46,015
He'll be hungry.

1637
02:01:46,091 --> 02:01:48,719
I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate....

1638
02:02:00,372 --> 02:02:01,430
Ashley!

1639
02:02:03,709 --> 02:02:04,971
Ashley!

1640
02:02:06,678 --> 02:02:07,770
Darling!

1641
02:02:18,056 --> 02:02:20,752
Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.

1642
02:02:20,826 --> 02:02:23,590
Turn me loose, you fool!
Turn me loose, it's Ashley!

1643
02:02:23,795 --> 02:02:25,763
He's her husband, ain't he?

1644
02:02:38,343 --> 02:02:40,402
-Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
-High time you got back.

1645
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:43,243
-Did you get the horse shod?
-Yes, sir. He shod all right.

1646
02:02:43,482 --> 02:02:47,077
Fine thing when a horse can get shoes
and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.

1647
02:02:47,152 --> 02:02:49,120
Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am.

1648
02:02:49,321 --> 02:02:52,722
I gotta know how much money
have you got left, in gold.

1649
02:02:52,958 --> 02:02:54,653
Ten dollars. Why?

1650
02:02:55,727 --> 02:02:56,955
That won't be enough.

1651
02:02:57,162 --> 02:02:59,221
What in heaven's name are you
talking about?

1652
02:02:59,297 --> 02:03:03,529
Well, Miss Scarlett, I see'd that old,
no-count white-trash Wilkerson...

1653
02:03:03,602 --> 02:03:06,162
...that used to be
Mr. Gerald's overseer here.

1654
02:03:06,371 --> 02:03:09,772
He's a regular Yankee now,
and he was makin' a brag...

1655
02:03:10,042 --> 02:03:14,979
...that his carpetbagger friends done run
the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.

1656
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:16,870
But how much more have we got to pay?

1657
02:03:16,948 --> 02:03:20,111
I hear'd the tax man say $300.

1658
02:03:20,185 --> 02:03:21,516
Three hundred!

1659
02:03:23,088 --> 02:03:24,885
Might just as well be $3 million.

1660
02:03:25,357 --> 02:03:27,086
But we gotta raise it, that's all.

1661
02:03:27,159 --> 02:03:28,251
Yes, ma'am.

1662
02:03:28,427 --> 02:03:29,394
How?

1663
02:03:31,797 --> 02:03:33,025
I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.

1664
02:03:33,098 --> 02:03:35,396
Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.

1665
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:37,900
Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't l?

1666
02:03:40,505 --> 02:03:41,870
Askin' ain't gettin'.

1667
02:03:51,349 --> 02:03:52,543
Ashley!

1668
02:03:53,885 --> 02:03:56,445
They say Abe Lincoln got his start
splitting rails.

1669
02:03:57,355 --> 02:03:59,687
Just think what I may do
once I get the knack.

1670
02:04:01,226 --> 02:04:03,694
The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.

1671
02:04:05,497 --> 02:04:07,089
What shall we do?

1672
02:04:07,799 --> 02:04:09,596
Ashley, what's to become of us?

1673
02:04:10,402 --> 02:04:13,064
What becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up?

1674
02:04:14,072 --> 02:04:17,041
Those who have brains and courage
come through all right.

1675
02:04:17,142 --> 02:04:18,666
Those that haven't are winnowed out.

1676
02:04:18,743 --> 02:04:22,042
For heaven's sake, Ashley,
don't stand there talking nonsense at me...

1677
02:04:22,114 --> 02:04:23,979
...when it's us who are being
winnowed out.

1678
02:04:24,049 --> 02:04:25,448
You're right, Scarlett.

1679
02:04:25,851 --> 02:04:28,479
Here I am talking tommy-rot
about civilization...

1680
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:30,749
...when your Tara's in danger.

1681
02:04:31,289 --> 02:04:34,156
You've come to me for help,
and I've no help to give you.

1682
02:04:34,726 --> 02:04:36,023
Oh, Scarlett, l...

1683
02:04:36,461 --> 02:04:37,758
...l'm a coward.

1684
02:04:38,730 --> 02:04:40,288
You, Ashley, a coward?

1685
02:04:41,366 --> 02:04:42,890
What are you afraid of?

1686
02:04:43,235 --> 02:04:46,727
Oh, mostly of life becoming
too real for me, I suppose.

1687
02:04:47,906 --> 02:04:50,272
Not that I mind splitting rails...

1688
02:04:50,709 --> 02:04:55,078
...but I do mind very much losing
the beauty of that life I loved.

1689
02:04:57,215 --> 02:05:01,709
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent
my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.

1690
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:04,220
But the war did come.

1691
02:05:04,456 --> 02:05:06,981
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.

1692
02:05:07,192 --> 02:05:09,626
I saw men crumple up in agony
when I shot them.

1693
02:05:10,962 --> 02:05:14,295
And now I find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death.

1694
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:17,961
A world in which there's no place for me.

1695
02:05:20,272 --> 02:05:24,003
I can never make you understand because
you don't know the meaning of fear.

1696
02:05:24,242 --> 02:05:26,369
You never mind facing realities...

1697
02:05:27,479 --> 02:05:30,346
...and you never want to escape
from them as I do.

1698
02:05:32,984 --> 02:05:34,008
Escape?

1699
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,283
Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.

1700
02:05:37,689 --> 02:05:39,316
I do want to escape too.

1701
02:05:39,958 --> 02:05:44,054
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.

1702
02:05:44,129 --> 02:05:48,156
I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton
until I can't stand it another minute.

1703
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:51,091
I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.
It's dead.

1704
02:05:51,169 --> 02:05:54,866
The Yankees and the carpetbaggers
have got it and there's nothing left for us.

1705
02:05:57,309 --> 02:05:58,606
Oh, Ashley...

1706
02:05:59,444 --> 02:06:01,071
...let's run away.

1707
02:06:01,146 --> 02:06:02,477
We'd go to Mexico.

1708
02:06:02,547 --> 02:06:05,607
They want officers in the Mexican Army.
We could be so happy there.

1709
02:06:05,684 --> 02:06:09,484
I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.
You know you don't love Melanie.

1710
02:06:09,554 --> 02:06:11,613
You told me you loved me
that day at Twelve Oaks.

1711
02:06:11,690 --> 02:06:13,624
And anyway, Melanie can't....

1712
02:06:14,326 --> 02:06:17,762
Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have
any more children and I could give you--

1713
02:06:17,829 --> 02:06:19,820
Can't we ever forget
that day at Twelve Oaks?

1714
02:06:19,898 --> 02:06:22,423
Do you think I could ever forget it?
Have you forgotten it?

1715
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:24,832
Can you honestly say you don't love me?

1716
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:28,604
-No. I don't love you.
-It's a lie!

1717
02:06:28,773 --> 02:06:32,834
Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie
and the baby, break Melanie's heart?

1718
02:06:32,911 --> 02:06:34,902
You couldn't leave
your father and the girls.

1719
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:37,414
I could leave them. I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them.

1720
02:06:37,482 --> 02:06:40,679
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.

1721
02:06:42,354 --> 02:06:44,515
You've carried the load for all of us...

1722
02:06:44,623 --> 02:06:47,751
...but from now on I'm going to be
more help to you, I promise.

1723
02:06:47,993 --> 02:06:50,086
There's only one way you can help me.

1724
02:06:50,161 --> 02:06:51,423
Take me away.

1725
02:06:51,796 --> 02:06:53,696
There's nothing to keep us here.

1726
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:56,089
Nothing.

1727
02:06:58,136 --> 02:06:59,535
Nothing except honor.

1728
02:07:12,484 --> 02:07:13,951
Oh, please, Scarlett.

1729
02:07:14,286 --> 02:07:16,345
Please, dear, you mustn't cry.

1730
02:07:16,721 --> 02:07:17,745
You mustn't.

1731
02:07:17,856 --> 02:07:20,154
Please, my brave dear, you mustn't plead.

1732
02:07:33,638 --> 02:07:35,697
You do love me, you do love me.

1733
02:07:35,974 --> 02:07:38,033
-Say it, say it.
-Don't, don't.

1734
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:39,709
You love me, you love me.

1735
02:07:39,778 --> 02:07:42,372
We won't do this, I tell you.
It won't happen again.

1736
02:07:42,514 --> 02:07:44,482
I'm going to take Melanie
and the baby, and go.

1737
02:07:44,549 --> 02:07:45,914
Say it, you love me.

1738
02:07:45,984 --> 02:07:49,476
All right, I'll say it.
I love your courage and your stubbornness.

1739
02:07:49,688 --> 02:07:53,454
So much that I could have forgotten
the best wife a man ever had.

1740
02:07:53,525 --> 02:07:55,993
But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.

1741
02:08:05,637 --> 02:08:07,628
Then there's nothing left for me.

1742
02:08:09,074 --> 02:08:11,133
Nothing to fight for.

1743
02:08:11,976 --> 02:08:13,910
Nothing to live for.

1744
02:08:16,614 --> 02:08:18,013
Yes, there is something.

1745
02:08:19,517 --> 02:08:21,576
Something you love better than me...

1746
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,049
...though you may not know it.

1747
02:08:30,161 --> 02:08:31,059
Tara!

1748
02:08:35,066 --> 02:08:36,624
Yes, l...

1749
02:08:38,403 --> 02:08:39,927
...l still have this.

1750
02:08:45,076 --> 02:08:46,338
You needn't go.

1751
02:08:47,278 --> 02:08:50,770
I won't have you all starve simply
because I threw myself at your head.

1752
02:08:52,217 --> 02:08:53,684
It won't happen again.

1753
02:09:22,013 --> 02:09:24,072
-Why, it's Emmy Slattery.
-Yes, ma'am, it's me.

1754
02:09:24,149 --> 02:09:25,116
Stop!

1755
02:09:25,884 --> 02:09:28,785
You haven't forgotten your old overseer,
have you?

1756
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:31,418
Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.

1757
02:09:31,589 --> 02:09:34,422
Get off those steps, you trashy wench!
Get off this land!

1758
02:09:34,926 --> 02:09:36,450
You can't speak that way to my wife.

1759
02:09:36,528 --> 02:09:38,621
Wife! High time you made her your wife.

1760
02:09:39,164 --> 02:09:41,860
Who baptized your other brats
after you killed my mother?

1761
02:09:41,933 --> 02:09:46,802
We came out here to pay a friendly call
and talk a little business with old friends.

1762
02:09:46,905 --> 02:09:49,499
Friends! When were we ever friends
with the likes of you?

1763
02:09:49,574 --> 02:09:52,543
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.

1764
02:09:52,877 --> 02:09:54,572
I know your father's turned idiot.

1765
02:09:54,646 --> 02:09:56,136
You can't pay your taxes.

1766
02:09:56,414 --> 02:09:58,780
And I come here
to offer to buy the place from you...

1767
02:09:58,850 --> 02:10:00,750
...to make you a right good offer.

1768
02:10:00,885 --> 02:10:02,250
Emmy's had a hankerin' to live here.

1769
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,413
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.

1770
02:10:04,622 --> 02:10:07,489
You high-flyin' lrish will find out
who's runnin' things around here...

1771
02:10:07,559 --> 02:10:09,254
...when you get sold out for taxes.

1772
02:10:09,327 --> 02:10:12,262
I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel
and I'll live in it.

1773
02:10:12,330 --> 02:10:14,355
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.

1774
02:10:14,799 --> 02:10:16,630
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!

1775
02:10:18,503 --> 02:10:19,936
You'll be sorry for that.

1776
02:10:29,013 --> 02:10:30,002
We'll be back!

1777
02:10:30,381 --> 02:10:32,645
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.

1778
02:10:38,423 --> 02:10:39,583
Pa, come back!

1779
02:10:43,061 --> 02:10:44,153
Pa, come back!

1780
02:10:44,395 --> 02:10:45,362
Pa!

1781
02:10:46,998 --> 02:10:48,295
Yankee coward!

1782
02:10:56,441 --> 02:10:57,169
Pa!

1783
02:11:17,962 --> 02:11:21,056
Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.
That's Mr. Gerald's watch.

1784
02:11:21,332 --> 02:11:24,028
You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it.

1785
02:11:24,569 --> 02:11:27,902
You ain't got no business partin'
from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.

1786
02:11:27,972 --> 02:11:31,135
You needs all your valuables
to sell for that tax money.

1787
02:11:31,576 --> 02:11:33,544
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?

1788
02:11:35,246 --> 02:11:36,235
And don't cry.

1789
02:11:37,382 --> 02:11:39,577
I can stand everybody's tears but yours.

1790
02:11:43,922 --> 02:11:45,617
Oh, Mammy, Mammy.

1791
02:11:51,529 --> 02:11:55,659
You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett,
you just gotta go on bein' brave.

1792
02:11:56,134 --> 02:11:58,068
Think about your pa like he used to be.

1793
02:11:58,202 --> 02:12:00,033
I can't think about Pa.

1794
02:12:00,271 --> 02:12:02,603
I can't think of anything but that $300.

1795
02:12:02,707 --> 02:12:04,607
Ain't no good thinkin' about that,
Miss Scarlett.

1796
02:12:04,676 --> 02:12:06,439
Ain't nobody got that much money.

1797
02:12:07,478 --> 02:12:10,538
Nobody but Yankees and scalawags got
that much money now.

1798
02:12:13,217 --> 02:12:14,275
Rhett!

1799
02:12:14,352 --> 02:12:15,944
Who that? A Yankee?

1800
02:12:21,259 --> 02:12:24,160
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and...

1801
02:12:25,029 --> 02:12:26,690
...l haven't any clothes.

1802
02:12:36,841 --> 02:12:39,639
Scoot up to the attic and get down
Ma's old box of dress patterns.

1803
02:12:39,711 --> 02:12:41,474
What you up to with Miss Ellen's portieres?

1804
02:12:41,546 --> 02:12:42,672
You'll make me a new dress.

1805
02:12:42,747 --> 02:12:45,272
Not with Miss Ellen's portieres.
Not while I got breath in me.

1806
02:12:45,350 --> 02:12:47,818
Great balls of fire!
They're my portieres now.

1807
02:12:48,319 --> 02:12:51,880
I'm going to Atlanta for that $300
and I've got to go looking like a queen.

1808
02:12:51,990 --> 02:12:54,151
-Who goin' to Atlanta with you?
-I'm going alone.

1809
02:12:54,225 --> 02:12:56,523
That's what you think.
I's goin' to Atlanta with you.

1810
02:12:56,594 --> 02:12:58,084
With you and that new dress.

1811
02:12:58,329 --> 02:12:59,387
Now, Mammy, darling.

1812
02:12:59,464 --> 02:13:01,432
No use to try to sweet-talk me,
Miss Scarlett.

1813
02:13:01,499 --> 02:13:04,161
I's knowed you since I put
the first pair of diapers on you.

1814
02:13:04,235 --> 02:13:07,068
I said I's goin' to Atlanta with you,
and goin' I is.

1815
02:13:07,505 --> 02:13:10,668
Kings and traes, huh?
Too good for me, Major!

1816
02:13:11,476 --> 02:13:13,910
Pity we couldn't have fought the war out
in a poker game.

1817
02:13:13,978 --> 02:13:17,004
You'd have done better than General Grant
with far less effort.

1818
02:13:17,181 --> 02:13:18,205
What is it, Corporal?

1819
02:13:18,282 --> 02:13:21,513
Sir, there's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister.

1820
02:13:22,086 --> 02:13:23,212
Another sister?

1821
02:13:23,955 --> 02:13:26,321
This is a jail, not a harem, Captain Butler.

1822
02:13:26,391 --> 02:13:28,222
No, Major, she ain't one of those.

1823
02:13:28,292 --> 02:13:30,226
This one's got her mammy with her.

1824
02:13:30,995 --> 02:13:32,155
She has?

1825
02:13:33,264 --> 02:13:35,789
I'd like to see this one, Major,
without her mammy.

1826
02:13:38,036 --> 02:13:40,800
Let's see, my losses for the afternoon
come to what?

1827
02:13:43,307 --> 02:13:44,899
Three hundred and forty.

1828
02:13:44,976 --> 02:13:47,035
My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?

1829
02:13:47,912 --> 02:13:49,140
All right, Corporal.

1830
02:13:49,213 --> 02:13:52,080
Show Captain Butler's sister to his cell.

1831
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:55,441
Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen.

1832
02:14:00,258 --> 02:14:03,853
It's hard to be strict with a man
who loses money so pleasantly.

1833
02:14:05,930 --> 02:14:08,364
-Rhett!
-Scarlett!

1834
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:10,793
My dear little sister.

1835
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:15,862
It's all right, Corporal.
My sister has brought me no files or saws.

1836
02:14:21,879 --> 02:14:23,073
Can I really kiss you now?

1837
02:14:23,147 --> 02:14:25,047
On the forehead like a good brother.

1838
02:14:25,349 --> 02:14:28,045
No, thanks.
I'll wait and hope for better things.

1839
02:14:28,853 --> 02:14:31,845
Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed
when I heard you were in jail.

1840
02:14:31,956 --> 02:14:34,015
I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.

1841
02:14:34,425 --> 02:14:36,120
It's not true, they're going to hang you?

1842
02:14:36,194 --> 02:14:37,354
Would you be sorry?

1843
02:14:37,462 --> 02:14:39,555
-Oh, Rhett!
-Well, don't worry, yet.

1844
02:14:39,964 --> 02:14:41,397
They have plotted
some charge against me...

1845
02:14:41,466 --> 02:14:43,093
...but they're really after my money.

1846
02:14:43,167 --> 02:14:45,499
They think I made off
with the Confederate Treasury.

1847
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:46,628
Well, did you?

1848
02:14:47,238 --> 02:14:48,705
What a leading question.

1849
02:14:48,873 --> 02:14:51,364
But let's not talk
about sordid things like money.

1850
02:14:51,442 --> 02:14:54,468
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look.

1851
02:14:54,746 --> 02:14:57,772
Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,
teasing a country girl like me.

1852
02:14:57,882 --> 02:15:01,045
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of seeing women in rags.

1853
02:15:01,119 --> 02:15:02,143
Turn around.

1854
02:15:02,787 --> 02:15:05,688
Marvelous! You look good enough to eat.
And prosperous, too.

1855
02:15:05,757 --> 02:15:07,588
Thank you, I've been doing very well.

1856
02:15:07,658 --> 02:15:09,455
Everybody's doing well at Tara, only...

1857
02:15:09,527 --> 02:15:12,826
...l got so bored I just thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town.

1858
02:15:13,364 --> 02:15:15,889
You're a heartless creature.
But that's part of your charm.

1859
02:15:15,967 --> 02:15:18,231
You know you've got more charm
than the law allows.

1860
02:15:18,302 --> 02:15:20,862
Now I didn't come here
to talk silliness about me, Rhett.

1861
02:15:20,938 --> 02:15:24,032
I came because I was so miserable
at the thought of you in trouble.

1862
02:15:24,108 --> 02:15:26,975
I was mad at you the night you left me
on the road to Tara...

1863
02:15:27,044 --> 02:15:28,477
...and I still haven't forgiven you.

1864
02:15:28,546 --> 02:15:30,207
Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.

1865
02:15:30,314 --> 02:15:34,011
Well, I must admit I might not be alive,
now, only for you.

1866
02:15:34,385 --> 02:15:38,116
And when I think of myself
with everything I could possibly hope for...

1867
02:15:38,189 --> 02:15:42,057
...and not a care in the world,
and you here in this horrid jail...

1868
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:45,529
...and not even a human jail, Rhett,
a horse jail.

1869
02:15:46,964 --> 02:15:49,296
Oh, listen to me trying
to make jokes when...

1870
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:51,158
...when I really want to cry.

1871
02:15:51,803 --> 02:15:53,236
In a minute I shall cry.

1872
02:15:56,874 --> 02:15:59,707
Scarlett, can it be possible that....

1873
02:16:00,411 --> 02:16:01,969
Can what be possible, Rhett?

1874
02:16:02,446 --> 02:16:05,279
That you've grown a woman's heart,
a real woman's heart?

1875
02:16:06,184 --> 02:16:08,311
I have, Rhett. I know I have.

1876
02:16:11,122 --> 02:16:14,148
You know, it's worth being in jail
just to hear you say that.

1877
02:16:16,227 --> 02:16:17,524
It's well worth it.

1878
02:16:22,466 --> 02:16:24,934
You can drop the moonlight
and magnolias, Scarlett.

1879
02:16:25,169 --> 02:16:27,467
So things have been going well
at Tara, have they?

1880
02:16:27,738 --> 02:16:29,103
What have you done with your hands?

1881
02:16:29,173 --> 02:16:31,300
I went riding last week
without my gloves.

1882
02:16:31,375 --> 02:16:34,435
These don't belong to a lady.
You've worked with them like a field hand.

1883
02:16:34,512 --> 02:16:36,241
Why did you lie? What are you up to?

1884
02:16:36,881 --> 02:16:39,111
In another minute I'd have believed
you cared something.

1885
02:16:39,183 --> 02:16:40,275
But I do care.

1886
02:16:40,351 --> 02:16:41,750
Suppose we get down to the truth.

1887
02:16:41,819 --> 02:16:45,721
You want something from me badly enough
to put on quite a show in your velvets.

1888
02:16:46,123 --> 02:16:47,522
What is it? Money?

1889
02:16:48,659 --> 02:16:50,854
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.

1890
02:16:51,529 --> 02:16:54,259
I did lie to you
when I said everything was all right.

1891
02:16:54,332 --> 02:16:58,325
Things are just as bad as they possibly
could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.

1892
02:16:59,470 --> 02:17:01,335
What collateral are you offering?

1893
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:02,963
-My earbobs.
-Not interested.

1894
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:05,031
-A mortgage on Tara.
-What would I do with a farm?

1895
02:17:05,109 --> 02:17:07,634
You wouldn't lose.
I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.

1896
02:17:07,712 --> 02:17:09,805
Not good enough.
Have you nothing better?

1897
02:17:12,683 --> 02:17:14,207
You once said you loved me.

1898
02:17:15,186 --> 02:17:16,847
If you still love me, Rhett....

1899
02:17:17,455 --> 02:17:19,650
You haven't forgotten
that I'm not a marrying man.

1900
02:17:20,725 --> 02:17:22,852
No, I haven't forgotten.

1901
02:17:28,699 --> 02:17:30,360
You're not worth $300.

1902
02:17:31,168 --> 02:17:33,602
You'll never mean anything
but misery to any man.

1903
02:17:34,171 --> 02:17:35,160
Go on, insult me.

1904
02:17:35,239 --> 02:17:37,366
I don't care what you say,
only give me the money.

1905
02:17:37,441 --> 02:17:41,207
I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go
while there's a breath left in my body.

1906
02:17:41,479 --> 02:17:42,537
Oh, Rhett.

1907
02:17:42,847 --> 02:17:44,974
Won't you please give me the money?

1908
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:47,510
I couldn't give you the money
if I wanted to.

1909
02:17:47,585 --> 02:17:49,678
My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.

1910
02:17:49,754 --> 02:17:53,349
If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd be
on me like a duck on a June bug.

1911
02:17:53,758 --> 02:17:56,625
So you see, my dear,
you've abased yourself to no purpose.

1912
02:17:59,964 --> 02:18:01,761
Here, here, here, stop it!

1913
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:04,668
Want the Yankees to see you like this?

1914
02:18:04,735 --> 02:18:06,566
Take your hands off me, you skunk.

1915
02:18:06,771 --> 02:18:08,932
You knew what I was going to say
before I started.

1916
02:18:09,006 --> 02:18:12,271
You knew you wouldn't lend me the money
and yet you let me go on.

1917
02:18:12,343 --> 02:18:14,038
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.

1918
02:18:14,211 --> 02:18:17,612
Cheer up. You can come to my hanging
and I'll remember you in my will.

1919
02:18:17,682 --> 02:18:20,549
I'll come to your hanging.
The only thing I'm afraid of...

1920
02:18:20,618 --> 02:18:23,712
...is that they won't hang you in time
to pay the taxes on Tara.

1921
02:18:30,328 --> 02:18:31,659
Tell him Belle Watlin'.

1922
02:18:32,063 --> 02:18:34,896
Where you been lately?
Thought you deserted Captain Butler.

1923
02:18:34,966 --> 02:18:37,093
Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out.

1924
02:18:46,711 --> 02:18:50,147
Who that? I ain't never see'd hair
that color before in my life.

1925
02:18:50,815 --> 02:18:52,476
Does you know a dyed-hair woman?

1926
02:18:52,550 --> 02:18:55,212
I wish I did know that one.
She'd get my money for me.

1927
02:18:57,822 --> 02:18:59,813
No matter what they done to you
in that jail...

1928
02:18:59,890 --> 02:19:01,585
...they didn't do no more
than you deserve...

1929
02:19:01,659 --> 02:19:03,718
...for visitin' white trash in a jail!

1930
02:19:10,801 --> 02:19:11,825
Fresh and green.

1931
02:19:11,902 --> 02:19:13,062
Right off the farm.

1932
02:19:13,137 --> 02:19:15,162
Hey, what are you doin' tonight, Susy?

1933
02:19:15,406 --> 02:19:16,805
That's one of them Georgia peaches.

1934
02:19:16,874 --> 02:19:18,808
There's nothing like that in Ohio.

1935
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:21,374
-You know what we're going to do?
-What?

1936
02:19:21,779 --> 02:19:24,805
We're going to give every last one of you
40 acres and a mule!

1937
02:19:24,882 --> 02:19:27,316
-And a mule?
-Forty acres and a mule!

1938
02:19:27,585 --> 02:19:28,552
Gee!

1939
02:19:28,619 --> 02:19:30,246
'Cause we're your friends...

1940
02:19:30,454 --> 02:19:32,285
...and you're gonna become voters...

1941
02:19:32,423 --> 02:19:34,823
...and you're gonna vote
like your friends do!

1942
02:19:36,627 --> 02:19:37,924
What's your hurry, sister?

1943
02:19:37,995 --> 02:19:39,394
What's come over this here town?

1944
02:19:39,463 --> 02:19:42,626
Yankees have come over it!
Same as they've come over all of us.

1945
02:19:45,169 --> 02:19:46,727
Out of our way, trash!

1946
02:19:47,371 --> 02:19:48,463
Get out of the way here.

1947
02:19:48,539 --> 02:19:49,699
Get away! Go on!

1948
02:19:58,282 --> 02:19:59,943
Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!

1949
02:20:00,017 --> 02:20:01,917
-Why Frank Kennedy!
-And Mammy!

1950
02:20:01,986 --> 02:20:03,817
It sure is good to see home folks.

1951
02:20:04,021 --> 02:20:05,545
I didn't know you were in Atlanta.

1952
02:20:05,623 --> 02:20:07,056
I didn't know you were.

1953
02:20:07,124 --> 02:20:09,285
Didn't Miss Suellen tell you
about my store?

1954
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:11,958
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?

1955
02:20:13,731 --> 02:20:15,995
Won't you come in, and look around a bit?

1956
02:20:24,542 --> 02:20:27,136
I don't suppose it looks like much
to a lady, but...

1957
02:20:27,211 --> 02:20:29,076
...l can't help being proud of it.

1958
02:20:29,747 --> 02:20:31,044
You're not making money?

1959
02:20:31,115 --> 02:20:34,312
Well, I can't complain.
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.

1960
02:20:34,819 --> 02:20:36,878
Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.

1961
02:20:37,455 --> 02:20:40,288
It won't be long now
before Miss Suellen and I can marry.

1962
02:20:40,658 --> 02:20:42,216
Are you doing as well as all that?

1963
02:20:42,293 --> 02:20:43,920
Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.

1964
02:20:44,161 --> 02:20:45,992
I'm no millionaire yet...

1965
02:20:46,063 --> 02:20:48,429
...but I've cleared $1,000 already.

1966
02:20:48,732 --> 02:20:49,824
And lumber too.

1967
02:20:49,900 --> 02:20:50,992
Well...

1968
02:20:51,702 --> 02:20:52,999
...that's only a sideline.

1969
02:20:53,070 --> 02:20:54,537
A sideline, Frank?

1970
02:20:54,705 --> 02:20:58,641
With all the good Georgia pine around
Atlanta and all this building going on?

1971
02:20:58,709 --> 02:21:01,200
Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...

1972
02:21:02,213 --> 02:21:04,306
...and I've got to be thinking
about buying a home.

1973
02:21:04,381 --> 02:21:05,939
What do you want a home for?

1974
02:21:06,016 --> 02:21:08,109
For Miss Suellen and me
to set up housekeeping.

1975
02:21:08,719 --> 02:21:12,052
Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her
to Atlanta, wouldn't you?

1976
02:21:12,923 --> 02:21:14,948
There wouldn't be much help
in that for Tara.

1977
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:18,854
I don't rightly know what you mean,
Miss Scarlett.

1978
02:21:19,263 --> 02:21:20,525
I don't mean a thing.

1979
02:21:20,598 --> 02:21:23,795
Frank, how'd you like to drive me out
to my Aunt Pitty's?

1980
02:21:24,735 --> 02:21:27,033
Nothing would give me
more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.

1981
02:21:27,138 --> 02:21:28,833
You'd better stay to supper, too.

1982
02:21:28,906 --> 02:21:32,273
I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable
and I'd like a good long visit with you.

1983
02:21:32,376 --> 02:21:35,004
Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett.

1984
02:21:36,247 --> 02:21:38,238
And will you tell me all the news...

1985
02:21:38,549 --> 02:21:40,346
...all the news of Miss Suellen?

1986
02:21:43,154 --> 02:21:44,746
What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?

1987
02:21:45,055 --> 02:21:46,579
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?

1988
02:21:46,657 --> 02:21:47,817
Oh, no, no.

1989
02:21:48,359 --> 02:21:50,293
I thought surely she had written you.

1990
02:21:50,394 --> 02:21:52,055
I guess she was ashamed to write you.

1991
02:21:52,129 --> 02:21:53,721
She should be ashamed.

1992
02:21:53,797 --> 02:21:56,357
Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.

1993
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:59,663
You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.

1994
02:22:00,671 --> 02:22:03,697
Well, she's going to marry
one of the county boys next month.

1995
02:22:05,242 --> 02:22:08,700
She just got tired of waiting
and was afraid she'd be an old maid and....

1996
02:22:08,946 --> 02:22:11,176
Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.

1997
02:22:12,349 --> 02:22:15,045
Oh, it's colder. I left my muff at home.

1998
02:22:15,286 --> 02:22:18,153
Would you mind
if I put my hand in your pocket?

1999
02:22:34,538 --> 02:22:37,029
But, Melanie, you don't realize
what she's done.

2000
02:22:37,675 --> 02:22:39,666
She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.

2001
02:22:40,144 --> 02:22:42,271
He's my beau,
and she's gone and married him.

2002
02:22:42,346 --> 02:22:44,576
She did it to save Tara,
you must understand that.

2003
02:22:44,648 --> 02:22:45,910
I hate Tara!

2004
02:22:45,983 --> 02:22:49,248
And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing
I hate worse than Tara.

2005
02:22:53,857 --> 02:22:55,085
It's all my fault.

2006
02:22:56,427 --> 02:22:59,726
I should have committed highway robbery
to get that tax money for you.

2007
02:22:59,797 --> 02:23:02,163
I couldn't let you do
anything like that, and....

2008
02:23:02,433 --> 02:23:03,923
Well, anyway, it's done now.

2009
02:23:04,001 --> 02:23:05,400
Yes, it's done now.

2010
02:23:06,470 --> 02:23:08,165
You wouldn't let me
do anything dishonorable...

2011
02:23:08,239 --> 02:23:10,901
...but you'd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn't love.

2012
02:23:12,042 --> 02:23:15,341
Well, at least you won't have to worry
about my helplessness anymore.

2013
02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:17,740
What do you mean?

2014
02:23:18,148 --> 02:23:19,581
I'm going to New York.

2015
02:23:21,218 --> 02:23:23,186
I've arranged to get a position
in a bank there.

2016
02:23:23,254 --> 02:23:24,585
But you can't do that.

2017
02:23:26,690 --> 02:23:29,887
I counted on you to help me start
a lumber business, Ashley...

2018
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:31,985
...and, well, I counted on you.

2019
02:23:32,162 --> 02:23:33,493
I wouldn't be any good to you.

2020
02:23:33,564 --> 02:23:35,225
I don't know anything
about the lumber business.

2021
02:23:35,299 --> 02:23:36,823
You know as much as you do
about banking.

2022
02:23:37,968 --> 02:23:40,027
And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.

2023
02:23:40,938 --> 02:23:42,701
That's generous of you, Scarlett.

2024
02:23:43,907 --> 02:23:45,169
But it isn't that.

2025
02:23:45,643 --> 02:23:47,804
If I go to Atlanta
and take help from you again...

2026
02:23:48,846 --> 02:23:51,246
...l'd bury forever any hope
of standing alone.

2027
02:23:51,415 --> 02:23:52,507
Oh, is that all?

2028
02:23:52,983 --> 02:23:57,044
Well, you could gradually buy the business
and then it would be your own, and....

2029
02:23:58,389 --> 02:23:59,686
No, Scarlett.

2030
02:24:03,294 --> 02:24:04,318
Ashley....

2031
02:24:12,336 --> 02:24:13,303
Ashley.

2032
02:24:20,511 --> 02:24:21,569
Scarlett!

2033
02:24:23,414 --> 02:24:24,676
Scarlett, what is it?

2034
02:24:24,849 --> 02:24:26,441
Ashley's so mean and hateful.

2035
02:24:27,451 --> 02:24:28,645
What have you done?

2036
02:24:31,222 --> 02:24:32,951
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.

2037
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:37,222
To help me start my lumber business, and
he won't lift a finger to help me, and he....

2038
02:24:37,295 --> 02:24:38,990
Why, how unchivalrous of you.

2039
02:24:39,297 --> 02:24:40,958
Why, think, Ashley, think.

2040
02:24:41,499 --> 02:24:44,297
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta.

2041
02:24:44,769 --> 02:24:47,567
And maybe we wouldn't have had
little Beau, and...

2042
02:24:47,638 --> 02:24:51,005
...and when I think of her picking cotton
and plowing just to keep food...

2043
02:24:51,075 --> 02:24:52,372
...in our mouths, I could just....

2044
02:24:52,944 --> 02:24:54,070
Oh, my darling.

2045
02:24:59,050 --> 02:25:00,278
All right, Melanie.

2046
02:25:00,918 --> 02:25:02,112
I'll go to Atlanta.

2047
02:25:03,988 --> 02:25:05,353
I can't fight you both.

2048
02:25:25,176 --> 02:25:27,804
Well, here's your new mill hands,
Mrs. Kennedy.

2049
02:25:28,279 --> 02:25:30,474
The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.

2050
02:25:31,649 --> 02:25:33,810
They look pretty thin and weak to me,
Gallegher.

2051
02:25:33,885 --> 02:25:34,544
Halt!

2052
02:25:37,521 --> 02:25:39,011
They're the best you can lease, ma'am.

2053
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:41,786
And if you'll just give Johnny Gallegher
a free hand...

2054
02:25:41,993 --> 02:25:44,120
...you'll get what you want out of them.

2055
02:25:44,395 --> 02:25:46,124
All right, you're the foreman.

2056
02:25:46,664 --> 02:25:50,156
All I ask is, you keep the mill running
and deliver my lumber when I want it.

2057
02:25:50,234 --> 02:25:51,792
Johnny Gallegher's your man, Miss.

2058
02:25:51,869 --> 02:25:52,995
But remember...

2059
02:25:53,237 --> 02:25:55,797
...no questions and no interference.

2060
02:25:56,240 --> 02:25:58,868
That's a bargain.
Start them in the morning, Gallegher.

2061
02:25:58,943 --> 02:26:00,877
Come on, get a move on!
Come on, move on there!

2062
02:26:00,945 --> 02:26:03,311
But, Scarlett, this isn't right
and you know it.

2063
02:26:03,814 --> 02:26:06,078
It's bad enough for a woman
to be in business, but--

2064
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:07,378
What are you complaining about?

2065
02:26:07,451 --> 02:26:09,817
You wouldn't have owned a mill
had I not taken over.

2066
02:26:09,887 --> 02:26:12,481
I didn't want the mill,
and we couldn't have bought it...

2067
02:26:12,556 --> 02:26:15,855
...if you hadn't pressed all of our friends
for the money they owed me.

2068
02:26:15,927 --> 02:26:16,916
Isn't that right, Ashley?

2069
02:26:16,994 --> 02:26:19,224
What are you running,
a charitable institution?

2070
02:26:19,297 --> 02:26:21,788
Go back to the store,
then go home and take your medicine.

2071
02:26:21,866 --> 02:26:22,924
You're not looking very well.

2072
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,195
But, sugar, shouldn't you come home
with me?

2073
02:26:25,269 --> 02:26:28,636
Great balls of fire. Don't bother me
anymore, and don't call me sugar!

2074
02:26:28,706 --> 02:26:30,537
All right, all right.

2075
02:26:31,075 --> 02:26:32,565
Good night, Ashley.

2076
02:26:34,645 --> 02:26:37,170
She can get mad quicker
than any woman I ever saw.

2077
02:26:38,983 --> 02:26:41,110
Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...

2078
02:26:41,185 --> 02:26:44,643
...l do wish you'd let me hire free darkies
instead of using convicts.

2079
02:26:44,722 --> 02:26:45,984
I believe we could do better.

2080
02:26:46,057 --> 02:26:49,151
Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,
and convicts are dirt cheap.

2081
02:26:49,226 --> 02:26:50,853
If we just give Gallegher a free hand--

2082
02:26:50,928 --> 02:26:54,364
A free hand! You know what that means.
He'll starve them and whip them.

2083
02:26:54,432 --> 02:26:56,400
Some of them are sick, underfed....

2084
02:26:56,467 --> 02:26:58,094
Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.

2085
02:26:58,269 --> 02:27:01,067
Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken
three times a day and...

2086
02:27:01,138 --> 02:27:03,231
...tucking them to sleep
with eiderdown quilts.

2087
02:27:03,307 --> 02:27:07,300
Scarlett, I will not make money out
of the enforced labor and misery of others.

2088
02:27:07,411 --> 02:27:09,140
You weren't so particular
about owning slaves.

2089
02:27:09,213 --> 02:27:11,773
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.

2090
02:27:11,949 --> 02:27:14,213
Besides, I'd have freed them all
when father died...

2091
02:27:14,285 --> 02:27:16,276
...if the war hadn't already freed them.

2092
02:27:16,587 --> 02:27:17,884
Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.

2093
02:27:18,289 --> 02:27:20,723
But have you forgotten
what it's like without money?

2094
02:27:20,791 --> 02:27:23,658
I found out that money is
the most important thing in the world...

2095
02:27:23,728 --> 02:27:26,162
...and I don't intend ever to be
without it again.

2096
02:27:26,230 --> 02:27:29,165
I'll make enough so the Yankees can never
take Tara away from me.

2097
02:27:29,233 --> 02:27:30,598
I'll make it the only way I know how.

2098
02:27:30,668 --> 02:27:33,193
But we're not the only Southerners
who have suffered.

2099
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:37,036
Look at all our friends. They're keeping
their honor and their kindness, too.

2100
02:27:37,108 --> 02:27:40,771
And they're starving. I've got no use
for fools who won't help themselves.

2101
02:27:40,845 --> 02:27:43,279
I know what they're saying about me,
and I don't care.

2102
02:27:43,347 --> 02:27:45,110
I'll make friends
with the Yankee carpetbaggers.

2103
02:27:45,182 --> 02:27:48,379
And I'll beat them at their own game,
and you'll beat them with me.

2104
02:27:50,788 --> 02:27:53,222
That's it. Move it a little over to that side.

2105
02:27:54,158 --> 02:27:55,591
Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.

2106
02:27:55,793 --> 02:27:56,782
Good afternoon.

2107
02:27:56,861 --> 02:27:58,488
Business is certainly growing, ain't it?

2108
02:27:58,562 --> 02:27:59,586
It certainly is.

2109
02:28:01,232 --> 02:28:04,167
But you're doing business
with the same people who robbed us...

2110
02:28:04,268 --> 02:28:06,759
...and tortured us and left us to starve.

2111
02:28:06,904 --> 02:28:08,064
All that's past, Melly.

2112
02:28:08,139 --> 02:28:11,631
And I intend to make the best of things,
even if they are Yankee things.

2113
02:28:14,311 --> 02:28:17,712
And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,
that Dr. Meade actually saw her...

2114
02:28:17,782 --> 02:28:19,977
...peddling lumber
to those Yankees, herself.

2115
02:28:20,217 --> 02:28:21,241
And that isn't all....

2116
02:28:21,318 --> 02:28:24,185
I think it's shocking what she's doing
to my brother, Ashley.

2117
02:28:24,255 --> 02:28:26,780
She's even taken to driving her own buggy.

2118
02:28:34,598 --> 02:28:36,293
My dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2119
02:28:36,367 --> 02:28:38,096
My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2120
02:28:38,669 --> 02:28:40,694
I don't see how you have
the gall to face me.

2121
02:28:40,771 --> 02:28:42,398
When I think you could have had
my millions...

2122
02:28:42,473 --> 02:28:44,100
...if you'd just waited a little while.

2123
02:28:44,175 --> 02:28:45,836
Oh, how fickle is woman!

2124
02:28:46,310 --> 02:28:48,710
What is it you want?
I have important things to do.

2125
02:28:48,779 --> 02:28:52,977
Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point
which has bothered me for some time?

2126
02:28:53,050 --> 02:28:54,278
Well, what is it? Be quick.

2127
02:28:54,752 --> 02:28:58,153
Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink
from marrying men you don't love?

2128
02:28:59,123 --> 02:29:02,024
How did you ever get out of jail?
Why didn't they hang you?

2129
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:04,427
Oh, that! Not much trouble.

2130
02:29:04,495 --> 02:29:06,258
There's nothing much
that money won't buy.

2131
02:29:06,330 --> 02:29:09,128
I observe it's even bought you
the honorable Mr. Wilkes.

2132
02:29:09,934 --> 02:29:11,697
So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.

2133
02:29:12,269 --> 02:29:14,100
Do you know,
I believe you're jealous of him.

2134
02:29:14,171 --> 02:29:16,969
You still think you're the belle
of the county, don't you?

2135
02:29:17,041 --> 02:29:19,100
That you're the cutest little trick
in shoe leather.

2136
02:29:19,176 --> 02:29:21,303
And that every man you meet
is dying of love for you.

2137
02:29:21,378 --> 02:29:22,436
Let me by!

2138
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:25,842
Don't be angry, Scarlett.
Tell me, where are you going?

2139
02:29:26,350 --> 02:29:28,215
To the mill, if it's any of your business.

2140
02:29:28,285 --> 02:29:29,718
Through shantytown, alone?

2141
02:29:29,787 --> 02:29:33,245
Haven't you been told it's dangerous
to drive alone through all that riffraff?

2142
02:29:33,324 --> 02:29:34,655
Don't worry about me.

2143
02:29:34,925 --> 02:29:37,621
I can shoot straight
if I don't have to shoot too far.

2144
02:29:45,302 --> 02:29:46,269
What a woman!

2145
02:30:21,705 --> 02:30:23,263
Could ya gimme a quarter?

2146
02:30:23,340 --> 02:30:24,705
Let go of my horse!

2147
02:30:27,011 --> 02:30:28,205
Hold this horse!

2148
02:30:39,190 --> 02:30:40,248
Help!

2149
02:30:40,791 --> 02:30:42,190
Help!

2150
02:30:43,794 --> 02:30:44,886
Help!

2151
02:31:19,129 --> 02:31:20,426
Miss Scarlett!

2152
02:31:39,483 --> 02:31:41,974
Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!

2153
02:31:42,419 --> 02:31:43,943
Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!

2154
02:31:44,021 --> 02:31:45,045
Big Sam!

2155
02:31:45,389 --> 02:31:46,686
Miss Scarlett! Wait!

2156
02:31:49,393 --> 02:31:50,792
Sam! Sam!

2157
02:31:51,262 --> 02:31:53,787
Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?
Did they hurt you?

2158
02:31:55,165 --> 02:31:58,862
Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.
Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.

2159
02:31:59,803 --> 02:32:00,929
Horse, make tracks!

2160
02:32:04,975 --> 02:32:07,375
You get to Tara just as quick as you can,
and stay there.

2161
02:32:07,444 --> 02:32:09,935
I sure will.
I's got enough of them carpetbaggers.

2162
02:32:10,214 --> 02:32:12,375
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.

2163
02:32:12,449 --> 02:32:14,076
Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.

2164
02:32:14,285 --> 02:32:17,584
Scarlett, change your dress and go over
to Miss Melly's for the evening.

2165
02:32:17,655 --> 02:32:19,520
I've got to go to a political meeting.

2166
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:20,750
A political meeting!

2167
02:32:20,858 --> 02:32:22,416
How can you go to a political meeting...

2168
02:32:22,493 --> 02:32:24,188
...after what I've been through
this afternoon?

2169
02:32:24,261 --> 02:32:26,752
Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.

2170
02:32:27,364 --> 02:32:31,425
Nobody cares about me.
You all act as though it was nothing at all.

2171
02:32:53,223 --> 02:32:55,885
The men talk, talk, talk
about protecting our women...

2172
02:32:56,193 --> 02:33:00,027
...and after what happened to me today
Frank has to go to a political meeting.

2173
02:33:04,168 --> 02:33:06,728
And if it won't pain you too much,
lndia Wilkes...

2174
02:33:07,104 --> 02:33:09,868
...l'd be much obliged
if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.

2175
02:33:09,940 --> 02:33:11,407
Has my face gone green or something?

2176
02:33:11,475 --> 02:33:12,533
It won't pain me!

2177
02:33:13,077 --> 02:33:15,705
What happened this afternoon was
just what you deserved!

2178
02:33:15,779 --> 02:33:17,906
And if there was any justice,
you'd have gotten worse.

2179
02:33:17,981 --> 02:33:18,948
India, hush up!

2180
02:33:19,016 --> 02:33:21,280
Let her talk, Melanie.
She's always hated me!

2181
02:33:21,352 --> 02:33:22,876
Ever since I took your brother
away from her...

2182
02:33:22,953 --> 02:33:25,114
...though she's too much of a hypocrite
to admit it!

2183
02:33:25,189 --> 02:33:26,588
If she thought anyone'd go for her...

2184
02:33:26,657 --> 02:33:28,215
...she'd walk down the street naked!

2185
02:33:28,292 --> 02:33:29,850
I do hate you!

2186
02:33:30,794 --> 02:33:33,957
You've done all you could
to lower the prestige of decent people.

2187
02:33:34,298 --> 02:33:36,823
Now you've endangered the lives
of our men, because they--

2188
02:33:36,900 --> 02:33:37,867
India!

2189
02:33:38,102 --> 02:33:41,697
I don't think we'd better say any more,
or one of us will be saying too much.

2190
02:33:41,972 --> 02:33:44,634
What's going on around here
that I don't know about?

2191
02:33:50,481 --> 02:33:52,142
Somebody's comin' up the walk.

2192
02:33:52,349 --> 02:33:54,112
Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.

2193
02:33:54,985 --> 02:33:57,419
Will you hand me the pistol, please,
Mrs. Meade?

2194
02:34:03,927 --> 02:34:05,087
Whoever it is...

2195
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:07,627
...we know nothing.

2196
02:34:11,368 --> 02:34:12,494
Where have they gone?

2197
02:34:12,569 --> 02:34:14,764
You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.
It's life or death!

2198
02:34:14,838 --> 02:34:17,068
Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.

2199
02:34:17,141 --> 02:34:19,439
Quickly, please! There may still be time.

2200
02:34:19,510 --> 02:34:20,568
How did you know?

2201
02:34:20,644 --> 02:34:22,407
I've been playing poker
with two Yankee captains.

2202
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:23,571
They knew there'd be trouble tonight.

2203
02:34:23,647 --> 02:34:25,410
They've sent their cavalry out
to be ready for it.

2204
02:34:25,482 --> 02:34:27,575
Your husband and his friends are
walking into a trap.

2205
02:34:27,651 --> 02:34:29,915
Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!

2206
02:34:33,056 --> 02:34:35,923
Out the Decatur Road.
The old Sullivan plantation.

2207
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:38,055
The house is burned.
They're meeting in the cellar.

2208
02:34:38,128 --> 02:34:39,425
I'll do what I can.

2209
02:34:44,334 --> 02:34:47,235
What's all this about?
lf you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!

2210
02:34:47,671 --> 02:34:49,138
We thought it best not to tell you, Scarlett.

2211
02:34:49,206 --> 02:34:51,697
But Ashley and Frank and the others
have gone to clean out those woods...

2212
02:34:51,775 --> 02:34:53,242
...where you were attacked.

2213
02:34:53,444 --> 02:34:55,071
It's what a great many
of our Southern gentlemen have had...

2214
02:34:55,145 --> 02:34:56,908
...to do lately for our protection.

2215
02:34:56,980 --> 02:34:59,881
And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,
Scarlett!

2216
02:35:00,284 --> 02:35:01,683
And it will be your fault!

2217
02:35:01,785 --> 02:35:03,719
Another word,
and you go out of this house, lndia!

2218
02:35:03,787 --> 02:35:05,778
Scarlett did what she thought
she had to do.

2219
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:08,620
And our men are doing
what they think they have to do.

2220
02:35:09,393 --> 02:35:10,485
Frank!

2221
02:35:11,228 --> 02:35:12,422
And Ashley!

2222
02:35:14,798 --> 02:35:16,095
Oh, it isn't possible!

2223
02:35:19,970 --> 02:35:22,461
There's horses, Miss Melly.
Here they come.

2224
02:35:22,573 --> 02:35:24,165
You're sewing, you're sewing.

2225
02:35:29,079 --> 02:35:30,376
Open the door, Mammy.

2226
02:35:40,591 --> 02:35:42,422
Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.

2227
02:35:44,862 --> 02:35:46,420
Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?

2228
02:35:46,497 --> 02:35:47,589
I am Mrs. Wilkes.

2229
02:35:48,432 --> 02:35:50,866
I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,
if you please.

2230
02:35:50,934 --> 02:35:51,923
He's not here.

2231
02:35:52,269 --> 02:35:53,258
Are you sure?

2232
02:35:53,337 --> 02:35:55,237
Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.

2233
02:35:55,539 --> 02:35:57,370
I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.

2234
02:35:58,075 --> 02:36:00,703
If you'll give me your word,
I won't search the house.

2235
02:36:00,777 --> 02:36:04,645
Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at
a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.

2236
02:36:04,715 --> 02:36:07,343
He's not at the store,
and there's no meeting tonight!

2237
02:36:07,651 --> 02:36:08,982
No political meeting.

2238
02:36:09,386 --> 02:36:11,946
We'll wait outside
till he and his friends return.

2239
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:16,425
Sergeant, surround the house.
Put a man on each door and window.

2240
02:36:16,493 --> 02:36:17,551
Yes, sir!

2241
02:36:22,165 --> 02:36:23,996
Keep on with your sewing, ladies.

2242
02:36:24,902 --> 02:36:27,200
And I'll read aloud.

2243
02:36:30,707 --> 02:36:33,801
"The Personal History and Experience
of David Copperfield.

2244
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:38,006
"Chapter one.

2245
02:36:38,448 --> 02:36:39,574
"l'm born.

2246
02:36:44,121 --> 02:36:47,887
"To begin my life, with the beginning
of my life, I record that I was born.

2247
02:36:48,825 --> 02:36:51,385
"Chapter Nine.
I have a memorable birthday.

2248
02:36:51,461 --> 02:36:53,486
"l pass over all that happened at school...

2249
02:36:53,564 --> 02:36:56,761
"...until the anniversary of my birthday
came around in March.

2250
02:36:57,968 --> 02:37:00,562
"Except that Steerforth was more to be
admired than ever.

2251
02:37:00,637 --> 02:37:01,899

2252
02:37:01,972 --> 02:37:05,066

2253
02:37:05,175 --> 02:37:08,508

than before in my eyes...

2254
02:37:08,946 --> 02:37:11,380
"...and, therefore, more engaging
than before, but...

2255
02:37:11,448 --> 02:37:13,348
"...beyond this I remember nothing.

2256
02:37:14,217 --> 02:37:15,445
"The great...."

2257
02:37:17,821 --> 02:37:18,947
"l remember nothing."

2258
02:37:23,994 --> 02:37:25,689
Melly! They're drunk!

2259
02:37:26,496 --> 02:37:27,986
Leave this to me, Scarlett.

2260
02:37:28,198 --> 02:37:29,995
And, please, say nothing.

2261
02:37:33,437 --> 02:37:34,927
You stupid fool!

2262
02:37:37,140 --> 02:37:38,266
Quiet!

2263
02:37:38,909 --> 02:37:40,843
Will you shut up for the love of...?

2264
02:37:41,378 --> 02:37:42,367
Hello, Melly.

2265
02:37:42,546 --> 02:37:45,572
So, you've got my husband
intoxicated again, Captain Butler!

2266
02:37:46,116 --> 02:37:47,140
Well, bring him in.

2267
02:37:47,217 --> 02:37:49,583
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.
Your husband's under arrest.

2268
02:37:49,653 --> 02:37:51,712
If you arrest all the men
who get intoxicated...

2269
02:37:51,788 --> 02:37:53,653
...you must have a good many Yankees
in jail.

2270
02:37:54,625 --> 02:37:57,287
Bring him in, Captain Butler.
If you can walk yourself.

2271
02:37:59,396 --> 02:38:00,727
I want to tell you a story....

2272
02:38:00,797 --> 02:38:02,162
Listen, Doctor, l....

2273
02:38:02,499 --> 02:38:03,761
Put him there in that chair.

2274
02:38:07,871 --> 02:38:10,237
And now, Captain Butler,
will you please leave my house...

2275
02:38:10,307 --> 02:38:12,901
...and try to remember
not to come here again?

2276
02:38:13,243 --> 02:38:16,110
Well, now that's fine thanks I get
for bringing him home...

2277
02:38:16,413 --> 02:38:18,973
...and not leaving him on the streets
in this shameful condition!

2278
02:38:19,049 --> 02:38:20,676
Now, boys, all together!

2279
02:38:21,118 --> 02:38:22,642
Dr. Meade...

2280
02:38:23,253 --> 02:38:25,118
...l'm astonished at you!

2281
02:38:31,895 --> 02:38:34,125
Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?

2282
02:38:35,966 --> 02:38:37,729
I ain't so very drunk, Melly.

2283
02:38:38,802 --> 02:38:41,430
Take him into the bedroom
and lay him out on the bed as usual.

2284
02:38:41,505 --> 02:38:43,097
Don't touch him, he's under arrest!

2285
02:38:43,173 --> 02:38:44,162
Now, Tom.

2286
02:38:44,274 --> 02:38:46,071
What do you want to arrest him for?

2287
02:38:46,410 --> 02:38:48,071
I've seen him drunker.

2288
02:38:48,311 --> 02:38:50,905
I've seen you drunker!
And you've seen me....

2289
02:38:50,981 --> 02:38:53,916
He can lie in the gutter for all I care!
I'm not a policeman.

2290
02:38:54,685 --> 02:38:56,448
But he led a raid tonight
on that shantytown...

2291
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:59,250
...where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble
this afternoon.

2292
02:38:59,389 --> 02:39:02,415
A lot of those shanties were burned.
A couple of men were killed.

2293
02:39:02,492 --> 02:39:06,360
It's about time you rebels learned you can't
take the law into your own hands.

2294
02:39:06,630 --> 02:39:08,154
What are you laughing at?

2295
02:39:09,866 --> 02:39:12,391
This isn't your night
to teach that lesson, Tom.

2296
02:39:12,769 --> 02:39:15,636
These two have been
with me tonight. Yes, sir.

2297
02:39:15,906 --> 02:39:17,134
With you, Rhett?

2298
02:39:18,208 --> 02:39:19,197
Where?

2299
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:25,714
I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.

2300
02:39:26,183 --> 02:39:27,275
You'd better say.

2301
02:39:27,918 --> 02:39:30,079
Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.

2302
02:39:30,187 --> 02:39:31,313
Speak out, Captain Butler!

2303
02:39:31,388 --> 02:39:34,084
I think I have a right to know
where my husband's been.

2304
02:39:36,293 --> 02:39:39,558
Well, ma'am, we dropped in
on a friend of mine...

2305
02:39:40,831 --> 02:39:42,162
...and the captain's.

2306
02:39:42,666 --> 02:39:44,031
A Mrs. Belle Watling.

2307
02:39:45,035 --> 02:39:48,129
We played cards, drank champagne and...

2308
02:39:49,139 --> 02:39:50,197
...well....

2309
02:39:50,273 --> 02:39:53,709
Now, you've done it! Did you have to
show me up in front of my wife?

2310
02:39:55,312 --> 02:39:57,177
Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.

2311
02:39:57,347 --> 02:40:00,680
These ladies won't be on speaking terms
with their husbands tomorrow.

2312
02:40:02,119 --> 02:40:04,144
Rhett, I had no idea, l....

2313
02:40:05,489 --> 02:40:09,016
Look here, will you take an oath
that they were with you tonight at...

2314
02:40:09,459 --> 02:40:10,585
...at Belle's?

2315
02:40:10,994 --> 02:40:13,929
Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.
She'll tell you, Captain.

2316
02:40:13,997 --> 02:40:16,158
Will you give me your word
as a gentleman?

2317
02:40:16,566 --> 02:40:17,658
As a gentleman?

2318
02:40:18,001 --> 02:40:19,298
Why certainly, Tom.

2319
02:40:21,972 --> 02:40:23,269
Well, if l...

2320
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:25,467
...if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.

2321
02:40:26,576 --> 02:40:28,942
I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I....

2322
02:40:30,647 --> 02:40:32,740
If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.

2323
02:40:32,816 --> 02:40:35,410
Well, I say I'm sorry, and...

2324
02:40:36,553 --> 02:40:38,180
...well, I am sorry.

2325
02:40:38,255 --> 02:40:39,745
Come on, Sergeant.

2326
02:40:46,229 --> 02:40:48,254
Lock that door. Pull down the shades.

2327
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:51,458
Ashley.

2328
02:40:51,568 --> 02:40:53,968
It's all right. It's only in the shoulder.

2329
02:40:54,237 --> 02:40:56,535
Get him on the bed
where I can dress the wound.

2330
02:40:56,606 --> 02:40:58,039
I think I can walk.

2331
02:40:59,075 --> 02:41:01,134
It's not worth the effort. Which way?

2332
02:41:01,211 --> 02:41:02,269
In here.

2333
02:41:03,947 --> 02:41:05,915
-Mammy, I want some hot water.
-Yes, sir.

2334
02:41:05,982 --> 02:41:07,449
-And lint for bandages.
-I'll find some.

2335
02:41:07,517 --> 02:41:10,486
Now what can I use for a probe?
lf I only had my bag.

2336
02:41:10,554 --> 02:41:13,216
Were you really there?
What did it look like?

2337
02:41:13,857 --> 02:41:17,884
Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,
plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?

2338
02:41:18,028 --> 02:41:20,189
Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,
remember yourself.

2339
02:41:22,899 --> 02:41:26,096
And now, Captain Butler,
tell me what happened, all that happened.

2340
02:41:26,636 --> 02:41:28,001
I was too late.

2341
02:41:28,638 --> 02:41:32,165
When I got to the old Sullivan place there'd
already been a skirmish with the Yankees.

2342
02:41:32,242 --> 02:41:35,075
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded
and Dr. Meade was with him.

2343
02:41:35,445 --> 02:41:38,744
I had to prove they had been somewhere,
anyplace but where they were.

2344
02:41:39,816 --> 02:41:41,374
So I took them to Belle's.

2345
02:41:41,551 --> 02:41:42,779
And she took them in?

2346
02:41:43,220 --> 02:41:45,415
She's by way of being
an old friend of mine.

2347
02:41:45,956 --> 02:41:47,947
Oh, I'm sorry. I--

2348
02:41:48,024 --> 02:41:50,720
I'm sorry I couldn't think up
a more dignified alibi.

2349
02:41:54,664 --> 02:41:58,259
This isn't the first time you've come
between me and disaster, Captain Butler.

2350
02:41:58,335 --> 02:42:01,168
It isn't likely that I'd question
any device of yours.

2351
02:42:03,373 --> 02:42:06,638
And now, I'll go and see
what Dr. Meade needs.

2352
02:42:12,349 --> 02:42:13,714
Oh, Ashley!

2353
02:42:15,518 --> 02:42:16,610
Ashley!

2354
02:42:18,655 --> 02:42:22,147
Have you no interest in what's become
of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?

2355
02:42:24,928 --> 02:42:27,192
Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?

2356
02:42:27,430 --> 02:42:28,522
No.

2357
02:42:29,132 --> 02:42:30,224
Well, where is he?

2358
02:42:31,201 --> 02:42:32,998
He's lying out on Decatur Road...

2359
02:42:34,070 --> 02:42:35,503
...shot through the head.

2360
02:42:36,706 --> 02:42:37,798
He's dead.

2361
02:42:48,084 --> 02:42:49,142
Who is it?

2362
02:42:49,619 --> 02:42:50,779
It's Miss Watlin'.

2363
02:42:50,987 --> 02:42:53,421
Oh, Mrs. Watling!
Won't you come in the house?

2364
02:42:53,924 --> 02:42:56,051
Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.

2365
02:42:57,127 --> 02:42:59,152
You come in and sit a minute with me.

2366
02:43:07,537 --> 02:43:09,664
How can I thank you enough
for what you did for us?

2367
02:43:09,739 --> 02:43:11,502
How can any of us thank you enough?

2368
02:43:11,574 --> 02:43:14,702
I got your note sayin' you was goin'
to call on me and thank me.

2369
02:43:14,778 --> 02:43:17,212
Why, Miss Wilkes,
you must have lost your mind.

2370
02:43:18,048 --> 02:43:20,107
I come up here as soon
as it was dark to tell you...

2371
02:43:20,183 --> 02:43:22,447
...you mustn't even think of any such thing.

2372
02:43:22,519 --> 02:43:23,543
Why, I'm....

2373
02:43:24,454 --> 02:43:25,546
Why, you're....

2374
02:43:26,089 --> 02:43:27,784
Well, it wouldn't be fittin' at all.

2375
02:43:27,857 --> 02:43:31,884
It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind
woman who saved my husband's life?

2376
02:43:31,962 --> 02:43:36,331
Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady
in this town nice to me like you was.

2377
02:43:37,100 --> 02:43:39,625
I mean, about the money
for the hospital, you know.

2378
02:43:39,970 --> 02:43:41,562
And I don't forget a kindness.

2379
02:43:41,972 --> 02:43:45,100
And I got to thinking about you being left
a widow with a little boy...

2380
02:43:45,175 --> 02:43:46,870
...if Mr. Wilkes got hung...

2381
02:43:47,510 --> 02:43:50,308
...and he's a nice little boy,
your boy is, Miss Wilkes.

2382
02:43:51,147 --> 02:43:53,672
I got a boy myself and so l....

2383
02:43:54,284 --> 02:43:56,377
Oh, you have? Does he live...?

2384
02:43:56,553 --> 02:43:58,817
Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.

2385
02:44:00,023 --> 02:44:01,456
He ain't never been here.

2386
02:44:01,992 --> 02:44:03,926
He's off at school.

2387
02:44:04,394 --> 02:44:06,419
I ain't seen him since he was little.

2388
02:44:09,432 --> 02:44:13,425
Well, anyway, if it had been
that Miss Kennedy's husband by hisself...

2389
02:44:13,737 --> 02:44:17,173
...l wouldn't have lifted a finger to,
no matter what Captain Butler said.

2390
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:19,174
She's a mighty cold woman.

2391
02:44:19,242 --> 02:44:21,403
Prancin' about Atlanta by herself.

2392
02:44:21,845 --> 02:44:24,177
She killed her husband
same as if she shot him.

2393
02:44:24,814 --> 02:44:27,476
You mustn't say unkind things
about my sister-in-law.

2394
02:44:31,121 --> 02:44:33,112
Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.

2395
02:44:33,423 --> 02:44:35,152
I forgot how you liked her.

2396
02:44:36,393 --> 02:44:40,420
But she just ain't in the same class
with you and I can't help it if I think so.

2397
02:44:41,231 --> 02:44:43,495
Well, anyway, I gotta be goin'.

2398
02:44:44,534 --> 02:44:48,300
I'm scared somebody'll recognize
this carriage if I stayed here any longer.

2399
02:44:48,371 --> 02:44:50,168
That wouldn't do you no good.

2400
02:44:51,074 --> 02:44:52,507
And Miss Wilkes...

2401
02:44:53,043 --> 02:44:56,274
...if you ever see me on the street,
you don't have to speak to me.

2402
02:44:57,047 --> 02:44:58,344
I'll understand.

2403
02:44:59,182 --> 02:45:02,982
I should be proud to speak to you.
Proud to be under obligation to you.

2404
02:45:04,320 --> 02:45:05,685
I hope we meet again.

2405
02:45:06,122 --> 02:45:08,352
Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fittin'.

2406
02:45:10,593 --> 02:45:13,118
-Good night, Miss Wilkes.
-Good night, Mrs. Watling.

2407
02:45:18,802 --> 02:45:20,861
And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.

2408
02:45:20,970 --> 02:45:23,268
She's brokenhearted about her husband.

2409
02:46:07,550 --> 02:46:09,814
Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.

2410
02:46:36,045 --> 02:46:38,343
Miss Scarlett, Captain Butler here
to see you.

2411
02:46:38,615 --> 02:46:40,742
I told him you was prostrate with grief.

2412
02:46:40,850 --> 02:46:43,478
Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.

2413
02:47:14,083 --> 02:47:15,448
She says she's comin'.

2414
02:47:15,885 --> 02:47:18,285
I don't know why she's comin'.
But she's a-comin'.

2415
02:47:18,354 --> 02:47:19,844
You don't like me, Mammy.

2416
02:47:19,923 --> 02:47:23,154
Now don't you argue with me, you don't.
You really don't.

2417
02:47:35,238 --> 02:47:36,637
It's no good, Scarlett.

2418
02:47:37,273 --> 02:47:38,205
What?

2419
02:47:38,274 --> 02:47:39,332
The cologne.

2420
02:47:39,809 --> 02:47:41,970
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

2421
02:47:42,478 --> 02:47:45,641
I mean you've been drinking.
Brandy. Quite a lot.

2422
02:47:46,583 --> 02:47:49,108
Well, what if I have?
ls that any of your affair?

2423
02:47:51,721 --> 02:47:53,348
Don't drink alone, Scarlett.

2424
02:47:53,556 --> 02:47:56,457
People always find out
and it ruins the reputation.

2425
02:48:02,966 --> 02:48:04,092
What is it?

2426
02:48:04,167 --> 02:48:06,135
This is more than losing old Frank.

2427
02:48:06,603 --> 02:48:07,968
Oh, Rhett...

2428
02:48:08,037 --> 02:48:09,095
...l'm so afraid.

2429
02:48:09,472 --> 02:48:12,168
I don't believe it.
You've never been afraid in your life.

2430
02:48:12,242 --> 02:48:13,709
I'm afraid now.

2431
02:48:13,977 --> 02:48:16,070
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.

2432
02:48:17,947 --> 02:48:20,882
You look pretty healthy,
and maybe there isn't any hell.

2433
02:48:20,950 --> 02:48:24,147
Oh, there is. I know there is.
I was raised on it.

2434
02:48:25,088 --> 02:48:28,182
Well, far be it from me to question
the teachings of childhood.

2435
02:48:28,791 --> 02:48:31,487
Tell me what you've done
that hell yawns before you.

2436
02:48:32,996 --> 02:48:35,464
I ought never to have married Frank
to begin with.

2437
02:48:35,798 --> 02:48:38,266
He was Suellen's beau
and he loved her, not me.

2438
02:48:39,168 --> 02:48:41,898
And I made him miserable.
And I killed him.

2439
02:48:42,438 --> 02:48:44,372
Yes, I did! I killed him!

2440
02:48:47,810 --> 02:48:52,474
For the first time I'm finding out what it is
to be sorry for something I've done.

2441
02:48:53,016 --> 02:48:55,007
Here. Dry your eyes.

2442
02:48:56,252 --> 02:48:59,187
If you had it all to do over again,
you'd do no differently.

2443
02:48:59,255 --> 02:49:01,883
You're like the thief who isn't
the least bit sorry he stole...

2444
02:49:01,958 --> 02:49:04,791
...but he's terribly, terribly sorry
he's going to jail.

2445
02:49:05,028 --> 02:49:06,996
I'm glad Mother's dead.

2446
02:49:07,730 --> 02:49:10,392
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.

2447
02:49:11,401 --> 02:49:14,165
I always wanted to be like her,
calm and kind and....

2448
02:49:15,371 --> 02:49:17,862
And I certainly have
turned out disappointing.

2449
02:49:19,776 --> 02:49:23,337
You know, Scarlett, I think you're
on the verge of a crying jag.

2450
02:49:31,287 --> 02:49:34,051
So I'll change the subject
and say what I came to say.

2451
02:49:34,557 --> 02:49:36,024
Say it, then, and get out!

2452
02:49:37,460 --> 02:49:38,449
What is it?

2453
02:49:38,528 --> 02:49:40,792
That I can't go on any longer without you.

2454
02:49:41,464 --> 02:49:45,594
You are the most ill-bred man to come here
at a time like this with your filthy--

2455
02:49:45,668 --> 02:49:48,159
I made up my mind that you were
the only woman for me...

2456
02:49:48,237 --> 02:49:50,137
...the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.

2457
02:49:50,206 --> 02:49:52,470
Now that you've got the lumber mill
and Frank's money...

2458
02:49:52,542 --> 02:49:54,772
...you won't come to me
as you did to the jail.

2459
02:49:54,977 --> 02:49:56,945
So I see I shall have to marry you.

2460
02:49:57,814 --> 02:49:59,475
I never heard of such bad taste.

2461
02:49:59,549 --> 02:50:01,915
Would you be more convinced
if I fell to my knees?

2462
02:50:01,984 --> 02:50:03,815
Turn me loose, you varmint,
and get out of here!

2463
02:50:03,886 --> 02:50:06,855
Forgive me for startling you
with the impetuosity of my sentiments...

2464
02:50:06,923 --> 02:50:09,585
...my dear Scarlett.
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2465
02:50:09,892 --> 02:50:13,020
But it cannot have escaped your notice
that for some time past...

2466
02:50:13,096 --> 02:50:16,429
...the friendship I have felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling.

2467
02:50:16,499 --> 02:50:19,900
A feeling more beautiful,
more pure, more sacred.

2468
02:50:21,070 --> 02:50:23,163
Dare I name it? Can it be love?

2469
02:50:23,806 --> 02:50:26,297
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.

2470
02:50:26,476 --> 02:50:28,171
This is an honorable proposal of marriage...

2471
02:50:28,244 --> 02:50:30,769
...made at what I consider
a most opportune moment.

2472
02:50:31,914 --> 02:50:34,883
I can't go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands.

2473
02:50:35,518 --> 02:50:37,679
You're coarse, and you're conceited.

2474
02:50:38,688 --> 02:50:41,248
And I think this conversation
has gone far enough.

2475
02:50:42,191 --> 02:50:44,659
Besides, I shall never marry again.

2476
02:50:45,728 --> 02:50:48,196
Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.

2477
02:50:48,765 --> 02:50:50,494
You? You!

2478
02:50:51,234 --> 02:50:52,599
I don't love you!

2479
02:50:53,102 --> 02:50:55,366
And I don't like being married.

2480
02:50:56,339 --> 02:50:58,569
Did you ever think of marrying just for fun?

2481
02:50:58,775 --> 02:51:02,142
Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.
Fun for men, you mean.

2482
02:51:03,379 --> 02:51:05,074
Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?

2483
02:51:05,148 --> 02:51:07,343
You've been married to a boy
and an old man.

2484
02:51:07,650 --> 02:51:10,710
Why not try a husband of the right age,
with a way with women?

2485
02:51:11,587 --> 02:51:16,081
You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know
I shall always love another man.

2486
02:51:17,427 --> 02:51:20,692
Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?
Stop it! No more of that talk.

2487
02:51:27,069 --> 02:51:28,536
Rhett, don't, I shall faint.

2488
02:51:28,604 --> 02:51:31,266
I want you to faint.
This is what you were meant for.

2489
02:51:31,507 --> 02:51:34,271
None of the fools you've known
have kissed you like this, have they?

2490
02:51:34,343 --> 02:51:36,937
Your Charles, or your Frank,
or your stupid Ashley.

2491
02:51:45,488 --> 02:51:48,582
Say you're going to marry me.
Say "yes." Say "yes! "

2492
02:51:48,825 --> 02:51:49,849
Yes.

2493
02:51:52,161 --> 02:51:54,652
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?

2494
02:51:54,730 --> 02:51:55,754
No.

2495
02:51:56,399 --> 02:51:58,526
Look at me and try to tell me the truth.

2496
02:51:59,101 --> 02:52:01,092
Did you say "yes" because of my money?

2497
02:52:01,704 --> 02:52:02,693
Well....

2498
02:52:02,939 --> 02:52:04,372
Yes. Partly.

2499
02:52:05,641 --> 02:52:06,733
Partly?

2500
02:52:07,443 --> 02:52:12,176
Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,
and, of course I am fond of you.

2501
02:52:12,348 --> 02:52:13,372
Fond of me.

2502
02:52:13,449 --> 02:52:16,907
Well, if I said I was madly in love with you,
you'd know I was lying...

2503
02:52:17,053 --> 02:52:18,918
...but you always said
we had a lot in common....

2504
02:52:18,988 --> 02:52:20,478
Yes, you're right, my dear.

2505
02:52:20,990 --> 02:52:23,322
I'm not in love with you any more
than you are with me.

2506
02:52:23,392 --> 02:52:25,656
Heaven help the man
who ever really loves you.

2507
02:52:26,395 --> 02:52:28,295
What kind of a ring would you like,
my darling?

2508
02:52:28,364 --> 02:52:31,561
Oh, a diamond ring.
And do buy a great big one, Rhett.

2509
02:52:31,634 --> 02:52:34,626
You shall have the biggest
and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.

2510
02:52:34,937 --> 02:52:36,928
I'll take you to New Orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon...

2511
02:52:37,039 --> 02:52:38,563
...my ill-gotten gains can buy.

2512
02:52:38,641 --> 02:52:40,131
Oh, that would be just heavenly.

2513
02:52:40,376 --> 02:52:42,401
And I think I'll buy your trousseau
for you, too.

2514
02:52:42,512 --> 02:52:44,104
Rhett, how wonderful, but...

2515
02:52:44,881 --> 02:52:47,042
...you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?

2516
02:52:47,517 --> 02:52:48,984
Still the little hypocrite.

2517
02:52:51,721 --> 02:52:53,814
Rhett, aren't you going
to kiss me goodbye?

2518
02:52:53,890 --> 02:52:56,586
Don't you think you've had enough kissing
for one afternoon?

2519
02:52:56,659 --> 02:52:57,751
You're impossible.

2520
02:52:57,827 --> 02:53:00,227
You can go and I don't care
if you never come back.

2521
02:53:00,296 --> 02:53:01,627
But I will come back.

2522
02:53:16,612 --> 02:53:18,671
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?

2523
02:53:18,781 --> 02:53:20,646
I'm thinking about how rich we are.

2524
02:53:22,652 --> 02:53:24,984
Rhett, I can keep
the lumber business too, can't l?

2525
02:53:25,054 --> 02:53:27,249
Yes, of course, you can, if it amuses you.

2526
02:53:27,523 --> 02:53:30,151
Now that you're rich
you can tell everyone to go to the devil...

2527
02:53:30,226 --> 02:53:31,625
...as you've always said you wanted to.

2528
02:53:32,028 --> 02:53:34,588
But you were the main one
I wanted to go to the devil.

2529
02:53:52,415 --> 02:53:55,873
Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.
I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.

2530
02:53:56,185 --> 02:53:59,643
Oh, Rhett, can I have one of those
chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?

2531
02:54:00,156 --> 02:54:03,455
If you don't stop being such a glutton,
you'll get as fat as Mammy...

2532
02:54:03,559 --> 02:54:04,992
...then I'll divorce you.

2533
02:54:05,828 --> 02:54:08,558
Wouldn't it be nice if you bought
something for Mammy, too?

2534
02:54:08,631 --> 02:54:11,623
Why should I buy her a present
when she called us both mules?

2535
02:54:12,368 --> 02:54:13,699
Mules? Why mules?

2536
02:54:14,003 --> 02:54:17,871
Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,
and get ourselves all slicked up...

2537
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:20,170
...like racehorses but we were just mules
in horse harness...

2538
02:54:20,242 --> 02:54:21,834
...and we didn't fool anybody.

2539
02:54:22,878 --> 02:54:24,675
I never heard anything more true.

2540
02:54:24,747 --> 02:54:26,305
Mammy's a smart old soul...

2541
02:54:26,616 --> 02:54:29,915
...and one of the few people I know
whose respect I'd like to have.

2542
02:54:31,053 --> 02:54:32,884
I won't give her a thing.
She doesn't deserve it.

2543
02:54:32,955 --> 02:54:34,684
Then I'll take her a petticoat.

2544
02:54:34,790 --> 02:54:36,985
My Mammy always said
when she went to heaven...

2545
02:54:37,059 --> 02:54:41,018
...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,
so stiff that it would stand by itself...

2546
02:54:41,297 --> 02:54:44,323
...and so rustly, the Lord would think
it was made of angels' wings.

2547
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:47,460
Why, she won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.

2548
02:54:47,637 --> 02:54:50,401
That may be, but I'm making the gesture
just the same.

2549
02:54:55,111 --> 02:54:57,306
Wake up! Wake up!

2550
02:54:59,081 --> 02:55:00,981
You were having another nightmare.

2551
02:55:02,284 --> 02:55:03,308
Oh, Rhett.

2552
02:55:03,719 --> 02:55:05,914
When I was so cold and hungry and...

2553
02:55:05,988 --> 02:55:07,478
...and so tired l...

2554
02:55:08,090 --> 02:55:12,049
...l couldn't find it. I ran through the mist
and I couldn't find it.

2555
02:55:12,895 --> 02:55:14,886
-Find what, honey?
-Oh, I don't know.

2556
02:55:15,665 --> 02:55:18,190
I always dream the same dream
and I never know.

2557
02:55:18,834 --> 02:55:20,665
It seems to be hidden in the mist.

2558
02:55:20,903 --> 02:55:21,995
Darling.

2559
02:55:23,305 --> 02:55:27,435
Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream
that I've found it and that I'm safe?

2560
02:55:28,778 --> 02:55:32,874
Dreams don't work that way, but when
you get used to being safe and warm...

2561
02:55:33,349 --> 02:55:35,249
...you'll stop dreaming that dream.

2562
02:55:35,651 --> 02:55:38,677
And, Scarlett, I'm going to see
that you are safe.

2563
02:55:42,992 --> 02:55:45,256
Would you do something
for me if I asked you?

2564
02:55:45,728 --> 02:55:46,922
You know I would.

2565
02:55:48,164 --> 02:55:50,462
Will you take me away from here?

2566
02:55:50,800 --> 02:55:52,267
Don't you like New Orleans?

2567
02:55:52,334 --> 02:55:55,861
Oh, I love New Orleans,
but I want to go home and visit Tara.

2568
02:55:57,273 --> 02:55:58,831
Will you take me to Tara?

2569
02:55:59,642 --> 02:56:04,136
Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.
We'll go tomorrow.

2570
02:56:07,550 --> 02:56:10,348
You get your strength
from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.

2571
02:56:10,419 --> 02:56:12,478
You're part of it, and it's part of you.

2572
02:56:12,555 --> 02:56:16,116
Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara
the way it was before the war.

2573
02:56:16,358 --> 02:56:19,259
Would you?
Then go ahead and make it that way.

2574
02:56:19,795 --> 02:56:23,094
Spend whatever you want,
make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.

2575
02:56:23,699 --> 02:56:25,189
Oh, Rhett.

2576
02:56:25,801 --> 02:56:27,291
Rhett, you are good to me.

2577
02:56:27,636 --> 02:56:29,968
And can we still have
our big new house in Atlanta?

2578
02:56:30,039 --> 02:56:32,599
Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want...

2579
02:56:33,075 --> 02:56:35,441
...marbled terraces, stained-glass windows
and all.

2580
02:56:35,511 --> 02:56:37,411
Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?

2581
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:40,608
I want everybody who's been mean to me
to be pea-green with envy.

2582
02:56:42,451 --> 02:56:46,615
I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,
building that new house just to show off...

2583
02:56:46,756 --> 02:56:48,986
...and even taking our servants.

2584
02:56:49,959 --> 02:56:52,860
Oh, darling, you mustn't think
unkindly of her.

2585
02:56:53,329 --> 02:56:55,923
She's made it possible for us
to keep Tara always.

2586
02:56:56,432 --> 02:56:58,024
Yes, and what good is Tara?

2587
02:56:58,501 --> 02:57:02,062
She's had three husbands
and I'll be an old maid.

2588
02:57:05,074 --> 02:57:06,905
Great Jehosophat!

2589
02:57:07,710 --> 02:57:09,405
Great Jehosophat!

2590
02:57:09,812 --> 02:57:11,837
Lordsy, we sure is rich now!

2591
02:57:12,047 --> 02:57:13,139
It ain't quality....

2592
02:57:13,616 --> 02:57:15,811
But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?

2593
02:57:16,585 --> 02:57:19,019
I'm entitled to at least see
what my own child looks like.

2594
02:57:19,088 --> 02:57:22,580
You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.
You'll be seein' it for a long time.

2595
02:57:23,392 --> 02:57:26,122
I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,
about it's not being a boy.

2596
02:57:26,195 --> 02:57:28,425
Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.
Who wants a boy?

2597
02:57:28,731 --> 02:57:31,928
Boys aren't any use to anybody.
Don't you think I'm proof of that?

2598
02:57:32,701 --> 02:57:34,532
Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.

2599
02:57:34,603 --> 02:57:37,128
Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?

2600
02:57:37,439 --> 02:57:38,770
She sure is.

2601
02:57:39,675 --> 02:57:41,302
Did you ever see a prettier one?

2602
02:57:41,377 --> 02:57:45,313
Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh
that pretty when she come, but not quite.

2603
02:57:45,748 --> 02:57:47,181
Have another glass, Mammy.

2604
02:57:51,854 --> 02:57:53,947
What's that rustling noise I hear?

2605
02:57:54,023 --> 02:57:58,221
Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothin' but
my red silk petticoat you done give me.

2606
02:57:58,327 --> 02:58:01,421
Nothing but your petticoat.
I don't believe it. Let me see.

2607
02:58:01,497 --> 02:58:02,657
Pull up your skirt.

2608
02:58:03,165 --> 02:58:04,757
Mr. Rhett. You is bad.

2609
02:58:05,801 --> 02:58:06,893
Yeah, oh, Lord!

2610
02:58:12,975 --> 02:58:15,535
You sure took a long enough time
about wearing it.

2611
02:58:16,212 --> 02:58:17,839
Yes, sir, too long.

2612
02:58:18,547 --> 02:58:20,515
No more mule in horse's harness?

2613
02:58:20,816 --> 02:58:23,785
Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad
tellin' you about that.

2614
02:58:24,119 --> 02:58:26,679
You ain't holdin' that
against old Mammy, is you?

2615
02:58:27,122 --> 02:58:29,955
No, I ain't holding it against you.
I just wanted to know.

2616
02:58:30,025 --> 02:58:32,789
Have another glass, Mammy.
Here, take the whole bottle.

2617
02:58:32,995 --> 02:58:35,429
Dr. Meade says you may go in now,
Captain Butler.

2618
02:58:39,335 --> 02:58:41,269
This sure is a happy day to me.

2619
02:58:41,570 --> 02:58:44,403
I done diapered three generations
of this family's girls...

2620
02:58:44,874 --> 02:58:46,933
...and it sure is a happy day.

2621
02:58:47,109 --> 02:58:50,476
Oh, yes, Mammy.
The happiest days are when babies come.

2622
02:58:50,546 --> 02:58:51,706
I wish....

2623
02:58:52,281 --> 02:58:55,444
Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.
What do you suppose they'll name her?

2624
02:58:55,551 --> 02:58:57,951
Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl...

2625
02:58:58,053 --> 02:59:01,113
...she's goin' to name it Eugenia Victoria.

2626
02:59:01,957 --> 02:59:03,049
Yes...

2627
02:59:03,259 --> 02:59:05,193
...she's a beautiful baby...

2628
02:59:05,961 --> 02:59:08,361
...the most beautiful baby ever.

2629
02:59:09,431 --> 02:59:10,625
Yes.

2630
02:59:12,167 --> 02:59:14,499
Do you know that this is your birthday?

2631
02:59:15,204 --> 02:59:17,365
That you're a week old today?

2632
02:59:18,007 --> 02:59:23,172
Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes
of which this town has never seen.

2633
02:59:23,879 --> 02:59:27,007
Yes, I'm gonna send her
to the best schools in Charleston.

2634
02:59:27,483 --> 02:59:31,579
Yes. And her'll be received
by the best families in the South.

2635
02:59:32,354 --> 02:59:34,845
And when it comes time for her to marry...

2636
02:59:34,924 --> 02:59:37,859
...well, she'll be a little princess.

2637
02:59:38,794 --> 02:59:40,728
You certainly are making a fool of yourself.

2638
02:59:41,030 --> 02:59:42,292
And why shouldn't l?

2639
02:59:43,332 --> 02:59:46,233
She's the first person
who's ever completely belonged to me.

2640
02:59:47,636 --> 02:59:49,331
Great balls of fire!

2641
02:59:49,405 --> 02:59:50,929
I had the baby, didn't l?

2642
02:59:51,874 --> 02:59:53,432
It's Melanie. May I come in?

2643
02:59:53,509 --> 02:59:54,533
Come in, Melly.

2644
02:59:54,743 --> 02:59:58,144
Yes, come in and look at my daughter's
beautiful blue eyes.

2645
03:00:00,449 --> 03:00:03,282
But, Captain Butler, most babies have
blue eyes when they're born.

2646
03:00:03,352 --> 03:00:06,321
Don't try to tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.

2647
03:00:06,388 --> 03:00:09,482
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue
and they're going to stay blue.

2648
03:00:09,658 --> 03:00:11,558
As blue as the bonnie blue flag.

2649
03:00:12,561 --> 03:00:14,859
That's it. That's what we'll call her.

2650
03:00:15,130 --> 03:00:16,290
Bonnie Blue Butler.

2651
03:00:25,107 --> 03:00:26,233
Try again, Mammy.

2652
03:00:34,316 --> 03:00:35,442
Twenty inches.

2653
03:00:35,951 --> 03:00:38,920
Twenty inches!
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.

2654
03:00:39,555 --> 03:00:42,080
You've simply got to make it
18 and a half again, Mammy.

2655
03:00:42,157 --> 03:00:43,681
You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...

2656
03:00:43,759 --> 03:00:46,125
...and you ain't never goin' to be
no 18 and a half inches again.

2657
03:00:46,195 --> 03:00:48,561
Never. And there ain't nothin'
to do about it.

2658
03:00:49,765 --> 03:00:51,756
There is something to do about it!

2659
03:00:52,001 --> 03:00:54,629
I'm just not going to get old and fat
before my time.

2660
03:00:55,738 --> 03:00:57,672
I just won't have any more babies!

2661
03:00:58,607 --> 03:01:01,667
I heard Mr. Rhett say
that he'll be wantin' a son next year.

2662
03:01:02,411 --> 03:01:05,244
Go tell Captain Butler
I've decided not to go out after all.

2663
03:01:05,314 --> 03:01:06,941
I'll have supper in my room.

2664
03:01:27,603 --> 03:01:31,334
I got your message.
I'll have them bring my supper up here too.

2665
03:01:38,347 --> 03:01:40,042
No objections to that, I hope?

2666
03:01:40,149 --> 03:01:41,275
No.

2667
03:01:42,551 --> 03:01:43,518
Yes.

2668
03:01:45,521 --> 03:01:47,853
I mean, I don't care
where you have your supper.

2669
03:01:50,659 --> 03:01:51,683
Rhett?

2670
03:01:52,628 --> 03:01:53,595
Yes?

2671
03:01:53,662 --> 03:01:54,686
You see...

2672
03:01:55,264 --> 03:01:56,925
...well, I've decided...

2673
03:01:59,168 --> 03:02:01,500
...well, I hope I don't have
any more children.

2674
03:02:14,283 --> 03:02:17,184
My pet, as I told you
before Bonnie was born...

2675
03:02:18,087 --> 03:02:21,079
...it's immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20!

2676
03:02:21,190 --> 03:02:22,680
No, but you know what l....

2677
03:02:23,425 --> 03:02:24,983
Do you know what I mean?

2678
03:02:25,094 --> 03:02:28,154
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this?

2679
03:02:29,398 --> 03:02:31,628
You're just low enough
to think of something like that!

2680
03:02:31,700 --> 03:02:35,466
If you had any chivalry in you or would
be nice like, well, look at Ashley Wilkes!

2681
03:02:35,537 --> 03:02:38,062
Melanie can't have any more children
and he....

2682
03:02:40,476 --> 03:02:43,172
You've been to the lumber office
this afternoon, haven't you?

2683
03:02:43,245 --> 03:02:44,940
What has that got to do with it?

2684
03:02:46,548 --> 03:02:49,813
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.

2685
03:02:50,018 --> 03:02:52,248
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.

2686
03:02:53,555 --> 03:02:55,546
You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.

2687
03:02:55,624 --> 03:02:56,682
Sorry for me?

2688
03:02:56,925 --> 03:03:00,486
Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing
away happiness with both hands...

2689
03:03:00,596 --> 03:03:03,030
...and reaching out for something
that will never make you happy.

2690
03:03:03,098 --> 03:03:04,690
I don't know what you're talking about.

2691
03:03:04,766 --> 03:03:07,701
If you were free and Miss Melly were dead
and you had your precious...

2692
03:03:07,769 --> 03:03:10,670
...honorable Ashley, do you think
you'd be happy with him?

2693
03:03:11,940 --> 03:03:14,932
You'd never know him,
never even understand his mind...

2694
03:03:15,677 --> 03:03:18,612
...any more than you understand anything
except money.

2695
03:03:18,947 --> 03:03:20,915
Never mind about that!
What I want to know is--

2696
03:03:20,983 --> 03:03:24,510
You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.
It'll work no hardship on me.

2697
03:03:25,420 --> 03:03:26,944
Do you mean to say you don't care?

2698
03:03:27,022 --> 03:03:30,583
The world is full of many things
and many people, and I shan't be lonely.

2699
03:03:31,260 --> 03:03:32,818
I'll find comfort elsewhere.

2700
03:03:33,262 --> 03:03:35,093
Well, that's fine. But I warn you.

2701
03:03:35,330 --> 03:03:38,265
Just in case you change your mind,
I intend to lock my door.

2702
03:03:38,567 --> 03:03:42,025
Why bother? lf I wanted to come in,
no lock could keep me out!

2703
03:04:00,656 --> 03:04:03,989
I always knew that most women
were cheats, hypocritical and hard.

2704
03:04:04,126 --> 03:04:06,560
-But this one....
-Rhett, it ain't no use.

2705
03:04:06,628 --> 03:04:09,324
-What do you mean?
-I mean you're poisoned with her.

2706
03:04:09,598 --> 03:04:12,931
I don't care what she's done to you,
you're still in love with her.

2707
03:04:13,035 --> 03:04:14,935
And don't think it pleasures me none
to say it.

2708
03:04:15,003 --> 03:04:17,904
Maybe so! But I'm through with her,
I tell you! I'm through.

2709
03:04:17,973 --> 03:04:21,238
You gotta think of the child.
The child's worth ten of the mother.

2710
03:04:27,916 --> 03:04:30,612
You're a shrewd woman, Belle,
and a very nice one.

2711
03:04:32,788 --> 03:04:33,777
Yes, Rhett?

2712
03:04:33,855 --> 03:04:36,756
I was just thinking of the difference
between you, and...

2713
03:04:37,492 --> 03:04:40,893
...you're both hard-headed business women
and you're both successful.

2714
03:04:41,029 --> 03:04:42,860
But you've got a heart, Belle...

2715
03:04:44,766 --> 03:04:46,063
...and you're honest.

2716
03:04:48,837 --> 03:04:49,997
Goodbye, Rhett.

2717
03:04:51,306 --> 03:04:52,534
Goodbye, Belle.

2718
03:05:08,423 --> 03:05:10,584
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!

2719
03:05:10,826 --> 03:05:12,851
Look at those hands, and that seat!

2720
03:05:13,161 --> 03:05:14,458
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!

2721
03:05:14,630 --> 03:05:17,565
Just why we have to wheel the baby
when we have a house full of servants....

2722
03:05:17,633 --> 03:05:18,691
Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.

2723
03:05:18,767 --> 03:05:20,291
Good morning, Captain Butler.

2724
03:05:20,369 --> 03:05:21,700
Good morning, Scarlett.

2725
03:05:21,770 --> 03:05:24,671
Making fools of ourselves
in front of these old buffaloes!

2726
03:05:24,806 --> 03:05:27,673
If you'd thought of your position years ago,
you wouldn't have to do this.

2727
03:05:27,743 --> 03:05:31,975
But as it is, we'll cultivate every female
dragon of the old guard in this town.

2728
03:05:32,981 --> 03:05:34,380
Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.

2729
03:05:34,449 --> 03:05:37,748
Good morning, Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.

2730
03:05:38,520 --> 03:05:41,250
So the millionaire speculator's
turning respectable!

2731
03:05:41,957 --> 03:05:44,152
All of our money can't buy
what I want for Bonnie.

2732
03:05:44,226 --> 03:05:46,456
Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.

2733
03:05:46,528 --> 03:05:48,860
But Bonnie's going to have a place
among decent people.

2734
03:05:48,930 --> 03:05:52,525
Yes, even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat.

2735
03:05:53,502 --> 03:05:55,197
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.

2736
03:05:55,504 --> 03:05:58,166
Good morning, Captain Butler.
Good morning, Scarlett.

2737
03:06:04,713 --> 03:06:07,648
Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had
a great regard for your knowledge.

2738
03:06:07,716 --> 03:06:09,411
I wonder if you could give me some advice.

2739
03:06:09,484 --> 03:06:10,473
Why, certainly, Captain Butler.

2740
03:06:10,552 --> 03:06:12,850
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't make her stop it.

2741
03:06:12,921 --> 03:06:15,355
You should make her stop it.
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.

2742
03:06:15,424 --> 03:06:16,482
I know, I know.

2743
03:06:16,591 --> 03:06:20,152
She has such a beautiful mouth, too.
I tried putting soap under her nails.

2744
03:06:20,295 --> 03:06:21,387
Soap! Bah!

2745
03:06:21,463 --> 03:06:24,955
Put quinine on her thumb
and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.

2746
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:27,725
Quinine! I never would have thought of it.

2747
03:06:28,136 --> 03:06:30,263
I can't thank you enough,
Mrs. Merriwether.

2748
03:06:30,339 --> 03:06:33,433
You've taken a great load off my mind!
Good morning.

2749
03:06:37,179 --> 03:06:38,441
Good morning, Dolly.

2750
03:06:38,613 --> 03:06:40,080
Wasn't that Captain Butler?

2751
03:06:40,315 --> 03:06:42,783
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking.

2752
03:06:43,251 --> 03:06:47,278
There must be a great deal of good
in a man who could love a child so much.

2753
03:06:47,422 --> 03:06:49,049
But of course there is!

2754
03:06:49,358 --> 03:06:53,089
Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing
told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler...

2755
03:06:53,195 --> 03:06:55,925
...finally admitted he was honored
by the Confederate Congress...

2756
03:06:55,997 --> 03:06:58,124
...for his services at the Battle of Franklin?

2757
03:06:58,200 --> 03:07:01,658
No! And did I tell you, Caroline,
that Captain Butler...

2758
03:07:01,770 --> 03:07:04,967
...made a stupendous contribution
to the Association for the Beautification...

2759
03:07:05,040 --> 03:07:06,974
...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?

2760
03:07:07,042 --> 03:07:08,031
No!

2761
03:07:08,777 --> 03:07:12,474
My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,
is giving a party for Bonnie next week.

2762
03:07:12,714 --> 03:07:15,478
Why, Dolly Merriwether,
you know right well it was my idea...

2763
03:07:15,550 --> 03:07:16,915
...to give a party for Bonnie Butler!

2764
03:07:16,985 --> 03:07:18,316
Why Caroline Meade....

2765
03:07:27,529 --> 03:07:30,464
Now watch Daddy put your pony over,
Bonnie. Now watch.

2766
03:07:33,702 --> 03:07:36,000
Daddy, let me! Let me!

2767
03:07:36,171 --> 03:07:38,503
All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!

2768
03:07:42,210 --> 03:07:43,336
Up we go.

2769
03:07:43,678 --> 03:07:44,975
Oh, there!

2770
03:07:45,280 --> 03:07:47,805
Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!

2771
03:07:47,916 --> 03:07:51,215
Grip tightly with your legs and sit close.
Lean forward and be sure you go with him.

2772
03:07:51,286 --> 03:07:54,084
Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.
Up!

2773
03:07:55,257 --> 03:07:57,487
That was fine! I knew you'd do it!

2774
03:07:57,793 --> 03:08:00,660
When you get a little older,
I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.

2775
03:08:00,729 --> 03:08:04,187
You'll be the greatest horsewoman
in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.

2776
03:08:05,333 --> 03:08:06,630
Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!

2777
03:08:07,769 --> 03:08:08,793
Mr. Rhett!

2778
03:08:09,805 --> 03:08:12,035
Did you see her, Mammy?
Wasn't she wonderful?

2779
03:08:12,474 --> 03:08:16,410
Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you
it just ain't fittin'...

2780
03:08:16,478 --> 03:08:19,572
...for a girl child to ride astraddle
with her dress flyin' up!

2781
03:08:19,748 --> 03:08:22,114
All right, Mammy.
I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.

2782
03:08:22,184 --> 03:08:25,415
And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.
She'll love that.

2783
03:08:25,487 --> 03:08:27,785
A nice black broadcloth is
what little girls wear.

2784
03:08:27,856 --> 03:08:29,983
Now, Mammy, be reasonable.

2785
03:08:30,492 --> 03:08:32,687
Well, I don't think it's fittin', but....

2786
03:08:34,729 --> 03:08:36,856
It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.

2787
03:08:38,633 --> 03:08:39,930
It ain't fittin'.

2788
03:08:50,145 --> 03:08:51,373
Why, Scarlett!

2789
03:08:52,147 --> 03:08:54,138
What are you doing downtown
at this time of day?

2790
03:08:54,216 --> 03:08:55,205
Ashley, I just--

2791
03:08:55,283 --> 03:08:58,650
Why aren't you helping Melly get ready
for my surprise birthday party?

2792
03:08:58,920 --> 03:09:02,219
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed
to know anything about that.

2793
03:09:02,657 --> 03:09:05,217
Melly'd be so disappointed
if you weren't surprised.

2794
03:09:05,393 --> 03:09:08,590
I won't let on.
I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.

2795
03:09:09,764 --> 03:09:11,891
As long as you're here,
let me show you the books...

2796
03:09:11,967 --> 03:09:14,765
...so you can see just how bad
a businessman I really am.

2797
03:09:14,836 --> 03:09:16,997
Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.

2798
03:09:17,305 --> 03:09:19,865
When I'm wearing a new bonnet,
all the figures I ever knew...

2799
03:09:19,941 --> 03:09:21,670
...go right slap out of my head.

2800
03:09:21,743 --> 03:09:24,974
The figures are well lost
when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.

2801
03:09:25,447 --> 03:09:28,416
Scarlett, you know,
you get prettier all the time.

2802
03:09:29,384 --> 03:09:33,218
You haven't changed a bit since the day
of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...

2803
03:09:33,755 --> 03:09:36,690
...where you sat under a tree
surrounded by dozens of beaux.

2804
03:09:38,827 --> 03:09:41,227
That girl doesn't exist anymore.

2805
03:09:41,730 --> 03:09:44,290
Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.

2806
03:09:44,633 --> 03:09:45,725
Nothing.

2807
03:09:46,434 --> 03:09:50,131
Yes, we've travelled a long road
since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?

2808
03:09:50,805 --> 03:09:52,363
Oh, the lazy days...

2809
03:09:52,607 --> 03:09:54,802
...the warm, still country twilights...

2810
03:09:56,111 --> 03:09:58,671
...the high, soft negro laughter
from the quarters...

2811
03:09:59,915 --> 03:10:03,146
...the golden warmth and security
of those days.

2812
03:10:05,387 --> 03:10:06,854
Don't look back, Ashley.

2813
03:10:07,589 --> 03:10:08,749
Don't look back.

2814
03:10:10,892 --> 03:10:15,591
It drags at your heart
till you can't do anything, but look back.

2815
03:10:20,735 --> 03:10:22,828
I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.

2816
03:10:24,105 --> 03:10:27,097
I'd never want you to be anything
but completely happy.

2817
03:10:47,562 --> 03:10:48,620
Oh, Ashley!

2818
03:10:51,199 --> 03:10:52,223
Who is it?

2819
03:10:52,300 --> 03:10:53,494
Only your husband.

2820
03:10:54,603 --> 03:10:55,399
Come in.

2821
03:10:56,671 --> 03:10:59,105
Am I actually being invited
into the sanctuary?

2822
03:11:00,675 --> 03:11:02,609
You're not ready for Melanie's party.

2823
03:11:03,144 --> 03:11:04,611
I've got a headache, Rhett.

2824
03:11:04,746 --> 03:11:07,214
You go without me,
and make my excuses to Melanie.

2825
03:11:09,217 --> 03:11:11,685
What a white-livered little coward you are!
Get up!

2826
03:11:12,187 --> 03:11:14,781
You're going to that party
and you'll have to hurry.

2827
03:11:15,223 --> 03:11:17,088
-Has lndia dared to--
-Yes. India has!

2828
03:11:17,158 --> 03:11:19,149
Every woman and man in town
knows the story!

2829
03:11:19,227 --> 03:11:20,660
You should kill them, spreading lies.

2830
03:11:20,729 --> 03:11:23,425
I have a strange way of not killing people
who tell the truth.

2831
03:11:23,498 --> 03:11:24,829
There's no time to argue now. Get up!

2832
03:11:24,899 --> 03:11:28,062
I won't go! I can't go
until this misunderstanding is cleared up.

2833
03:11:28,136 --> 03:11:30,730
You won't cheat Miss Melly
out of the satisfaction of publicly...

2834
03:11:30,805 --> 03:11:32,204
...ordering you out of her house.

2835
03:11:32,273 --> 03:11:34,002
There was nothing wrong.
India hates me so.

2836
03:11:34,075 --> 03:11:35,975
I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.

2837
03:11:36,044 --> 03:11:39,536
If you don't show it tonight,
you'll never be able to as long as you live.

2838
03:11:39,614 --> 03:11:42,515
While that wouldn't bother me,
you're ruining Bonnie's chances.

2839
03:11:42,584 --> 03:11:45,917
You're going to that party,
if only for her sake. Now, get dressed!

2840
03:11:59,467 --> 03:12:02,868
Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly
will do for this occasion.

2841
03:12:03,405 --> 03:12:06,397
And put on plenty of rouge.
I want you to look your part tonight.

2842
03:12:13,682 --> 03:12:18,813
"For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

2843
03:12:18,987 --> 03:12:24,015
"For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny

2844
03:12:24,459 --> 03:12:28,156
"Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny

2845
03:12:28,897 --> 03:12:31,331
"For he's a jolly good fellow...."

2846
03:12:33,134 --> 03:12:35,659
-Good night, Scarlett.
-But Rhett, you can't--

2847
03:12:35,737 --> 03:12:38,706
You go into the arena alone.
The lions are hungry for you.

2848
03:12:38,907 --> 03:12:40,499
Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.

2849
03:12:40,575 --> 03:12:41,735
You're not afraid?

2850
03:12:41,943 --> 03:12:44,070
"Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny

2851
03:12:44,145 --> 03:12:48,707
"For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

2852
03:12:48,817 --> 03:12:54,084
"For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny."

2853
03:13:08,603 --> 03:13:10,628
What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.

2854
03:13:10,972 --> 03:13:12,633
India wasn't able to come tonight.

2855
03:13:12,707 --> 03:13:13,935
Will you be an angel?

2856
03:13:14,008 --> 03:13:16,499
I do need you to help me
receive my guests.

2857
03:13:20,315 --> 03:13:21,748
Mrs. Meade...

2858
03:13:21,983 --> 03:13:23,610
...here's our darling Scarlett.

2859
03:13:25,653 --> 03:13:26,711
Good evening.

2860
03:13:26,821 --> 03:13:27,879
Good evening.

2861
03:13:28,156 --> 03:13:29,214
Why Scarlett!

2862
03:13:29,991 --> 03:13:32,858
-Good evening, Miss Scarlett.
-Good evening, Mrs. Butler.

2863
03:13:33,628 --> 03:13:36,756
Ashley, aren't you going to get
our Scarlett a glass of punch?

2864
03:13:44,706 --> 03:13:47,641
Did you have a good time tonight
at Miss Melly's party, child?

2865
03:13:47,709 --> 03:13:48,733
Yes, yes.

2866
03:13:48,810 --> 03:13:50,675
Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word...

2867
03:13:50,745 --> 03:13:53,839
...if Captain Butler asks for me
when he comes back, I'm asleep.

2868
03:13:54,215 --> 03:13:55,204
Yes, ma'am.

2869
03:14:24,646 --> 03:14:25,943
Come in, Mrs. Butler.

2870
03:14:35,456 --> 03:14:36,582
Come here.

2871
03:14:52,473 --> 03:14:53,497
Sit down!

2872
03:14:56,177 --> 03:14:59,806
There's no reason why you shouldn't have
your nightcap even if I am here.

2873
03:14:59,948 --> 03:15:02,109
I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and--

2874
03:15:02,183 --> 03:15:03,946
You heard nothing of the kind.

2875
03:15:04,519 --> 03:15:07,249
You wouldn't have come down
if you'd thought I was here.

2876
03:15:07,388 --> 03:15:09,618
-You must need a drink badly.
-I do not!

2877
03:15:09,691 --> 03:15:12,489
Take it. Don't give yourself airs.

2878
03:15:12,560 --> 03:15:15,620
I know you drink on the quiet,
and I know how much you drink.

2879
03:15:16,064 --> 03:15:18,362
Do you think I care if you like your brandy?

2880
03:15:25,506 --> 03:15:26,837
You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!

2881
03:15:26,908 --> 03:15:28,398
I'm very drunk...

2882
03:15:28,743 --> 03:15:31,940
...and I intend getting still drunker
before the evening's over...

2883
03:15:32,680 --> 03:15:35,410
...but you're not going to bed, not yet!

2884
03:15:36,684 --> 03:15:37,810
Sit down!

2885
03:15:41,022 --> 03:15:42,956
So she stood by you, did she?

2886
03:15:44,192 --> 03:15:47,787
How does it feel to have the woman
you've wronged cloak your sins for you?

2887
03:15:49,464 --> 03:15:52,160
You're wondering if she knows
all about you and Ashley.

2888
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:55,294
You're wondering if she did it
just to save her face.

2889
03:15:55,937 --> 03:15:59,566
You're thinking that she's a fool for doing it
even if it did save your hide.

2890
03:15:59,641 --> 03:16:01,802
-I will not listen.
-Yes, you'll listen!

2891
03:16:02,877 --> 03:16:05,277
Miss Melly's a fool,
but not the kind you think.

2892
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:09,343
It's just that there's too much honor in her
to ever conceive of dishonor...

2893
03:16:09,417 --> 03:16:11,009
...in anyone she loves.

2894
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:13,182
And she loves you.

2895
03:16:13,955 --> 03:16:16,788
Though just why she does,
I'm sure I don't know!

2896
03:16:17,959 --> 03:16:21,224
If you weren't so drunk and insulting,
I could explain everything.

2897
03:16:21,696 --> 03:16:24,597
-As it is though--
-If you get out of that chair once more!

2898
03:16:29,003 --> 03:16:33,633
Of course, the comic figure in all this is
the long suffering Mr. Wilkes!

2899
03:16:34,676 --> 03:16:37,645
Mr. Wilkes, who can't be
mentally faithful to his wife...

2900
03:16:37,745 --> 03:16:40,305
...and won't be unfaithful to her technically.

2901
03:16:41,983 --> 03:16:43,746
Why doesn't he make up his mind?

2902
03:16:43,851 --> 03:16:44,943
Rhett, you....

2903
03:16:48,389 --> 03:16:50,789
Observe my hands, my dear.

2904
03:16:51,793 --> 03:16:54,227
I could tear you to pieces with them.

2905
03:16:54,896 --> 03:16:58,423
And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley
out of your mind forever.

2906
03:16:59,500 --> 03:17:01,058
But it wouldn't.

2907
03:17:01,903 --> 03:17:05,669
So I'll remove him
from your mind forever this way.

2908
03:17:06,874 --> 03:17:08,967
I'll put my hands so...

2909
03:17:09,844 --> 03:17:11,971
...one on each side of your head...

2910
03:17:12,981 --> 03:17:17,042
...and I'll smash your skull between them
like a walnut.

2911
03:17:17,852 --> 03:17:20,082
And that'll block him out.

2912
03:17:21,356 --> 03:17:24,052
Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.

2913
03:17:29,330 --> 03:17:32,561
You know I've always admired
your spirit, my dear.

2914
03:17:33,534 --> 03:17:35,832
Never more than now,
when you're cornered.

2915
03:17:37,005 --> 03:17:38,165
I'm not cornered.

2916
03:17:38,439 --> 03:17:41,272
And you'll never corner me,
Rhett Butler, or frighten me!

2917
03:17:41,342 --> 03:17:44,505
You've lived in dirt so long,
you can't understand anything else.

2918
03:17:44,912 --> 03:17:48,643
And you're jealous of something
you can't understand. Good night!

2919
03:17:51,185 --> 03:17:52,550
Jealous, am l?

2920
03:17:52,653 --> 03:17:54,177
Yes, I suppose I am.

2921
03:17:55,056 --> 03:17:58,082
Even though I know you've been faithful
to me all along.

2922
03:17:58,693 --> 03:17:59,921
How do I know?

2923
03:18:00,061 --> 03:18:03,224
Because I know Ashley Wilkes,
and his honorable breed.

2924
03:18:03,831 --> 03:18:04,923
They're gentlemen!

2925
03:18:05,566 --> 03:18:08,228
And that's more than I can say
for you or for me!

2926
03:18:09,237 --> 03:18:12,764
We're not gentlemen,
and we have no honor, have we?

2927
03:18:22,417 --> 03:18:24,510
It's not that easy, Scarlett.

2928
03:18:28,856 --> 03:18:30,824
You turned me out
while you chased Ashley Wilkes.

2929
03:18:30,892 --> 03:18:32,689
While you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.

2930
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:34,990
This is one night
you're not turning me out!

2931
03:19:03,491 --> 03:19:05,618
How are you feeling this morning, Mammy?

2932
03:19:05,693 --> 03:19:09,561
Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.

2933
03:19:12,533 --> 03:19:15,058
You actin' mighty happy this mornin',
Miss Scarlett.

2934
03:19:15,203 --> 03:19:16,670
I am, Mammy. I am.

2935
03:19:23,811 --> 03:19:28,646
"Oh, she wept with delight
when he gave her a smile

2936
03:19:29,150 --> 03:19:33,712
"And trembled with fear at his frown."

2937
03:19:50,605 --> 03:19:51,629
Hello.

2938
03:19:54,475 --> 03:19:58,070
I'd like to extend my apologies
for my conduct of last night.

2939
03:19:58,346 --> 03:19:59,540
Oh, but Rhett....

2940
03:20:00,047 --> 03:20:01,275
I was very drunk...

2941
03:20:01,349 --> 03:20:04,614
...and quite swept off my feet
by your charms.

2942
03:20:06,854 --> 03:20:10,415
Well, you needn't bother to apologize.
Nothing you ever do surprises me!

2943
03:20:11,125 --> 03:20:13,923
I've been thinking things over,
and I really believe that...

2944
03:20:13,995 --> 03:20:15,485
...it would be better for both of us...

2945
03:20:15,563 --> 03:20:18,293
...if we admitted we'd made a mistake
and got a divorce.

2946
03:20:18,499 --> 03:20:19,761
-A divorce?
-Yes.

2947
03:20:20,268 --> 03:20:22,896
There's no point in our holding on
to each other, is there?

2948
03:20:22,970 --> 03:20:25,495
I'll provide for you amply.
You've plenty of grounds.

2949
03:20:25,573 --> 03:20:28,406
Just give me Bonnie. You can say
what you please, I won't contest it.

2950
03:20:28,476 --> 03:20:29,465
Thank you very much.

2951
03:20:29,544 --> 03:20:32,570
But I wouldn't dream of disgracing
the family with a divorce.

2952
03:20:33,314 --> 03:20:35,805
You'd disgrace it quick enough
if Ashley were free.

2953
03:20:35,883 --> 03:20:38,875
It makes my head spin to think
how quickly you'd divorce me.

2954
03:20:40,021 --> 03:20:41,420
Wouldn't you, Scarlett?

2955
03:20:42,857 --> 03:20:44,085
Well, answer me.

2956
03:20:44,158 --> 03:20:45,182
Wouldn't you?

2957
03:20:45,259 --> 03:20:47,489
Will you please go now,
and leave me alone?

2958
03:20:49,030 --> 03:20:51,362
Yes, I'm going.
That's what I came to tell you.

2959
03:20:52,366 --> 03:20:55,767
I'm going on a very extended trip
to London, and I'm leaving today.

2960
03:20:57,104 --> 03:20:58,765
And I'm taking Bonnie with me.

2961
03:20:58,839 --> 03:21:01,307
So you'll please get
her little duds packed right away.

2962
03:21:01,375 --> 03:21:03,605
You'll never take my child
out of this house.

2963
03:21:04,011 --> 03:21:05,876
She's my child, too, Scarlett.

2964
03:21:05,980 --> 03:21:08,073
You're making a mistake,
if you think I'm leaving her here...

2965
03:21:08,149 --> 03:21:10,811
...with a mother who hasn't the decency
to consider her own reputation.

2966
03:21:10,885 --> 03:21:12,284
You're a fine one to talk.

2967
03:21:12,887 --> 03:21:14,286
You think I'll let that child out
of this house...

2968
03:21:14,355 --> 03:21:17,984
...when you'll probably have her around
with people like that Belle?

2969
03:21:18,092 --> 03:21:20,458
If you were a man
I'd break your neck for that.

2970
03:21:20,861 --> 03:21:23,022
As it is, I'll thank you
to shut your stupid mouth.

2971
03:21:23,097 --> 03:21:25,964
As for you, giving yourself pious airs
about your motherhood....

2972
03:21:26,033 --> 03:21:28,297
Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.

2973
03:21:28,402 --> 03:21:31,371
Have her things packed and ready
for me in an hour, or I warn you....

2974
03:21:31,439 --> 03:21:35,273
I've always thought a good lashing with a
buggy whip would benefit you immensely.

2975
03:21:40,748 --> 03:21:42,010
Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.

2976
03:21:43,050 --> 03:21:44,074
Hello, Uncle Rhett.

2977
03:21:44,151 --> 03:21:45,618
Hello, hello, Beau.

2978
03:21:45,686 --> 03:21:47,017
Daddy, Daddy!

2979
03:21:47,421 --> 03:21:50,754
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all morning.

2980
03:21:50,958 --> 03:21:54,485
Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin
to wrap my little Bonnie in.

2981
03:21:54,662 --> 03:21:56,562
Give your best sweetheart a kiss.

2982
03:22:00,001 --> 03:22:03,095
I'm going to take you
on a long trip to fairyland!

2983
03:22:04,138 --> 03:22:05,435
Where? Where?

2984
03:22:05,840 --> 03:22:09,435
I'm going to show you the Tower
of London, where the little princes were...

2985
03:22:09,744 --> 03:22:11,075
...and London Bridge.

2986
03:22:11,746 --> 03:22:13,179
London Bridge!

2987
03:22:13,281 --> 03:22:15,078
Will it be falling down?

2988
03:22:16,584 --> 03:22:18,848
Well, it will if you want it to, darling.

2989
03:22:21,389 --> 03:22:23,516
Daddy, dark!

2990
03:22:24,892 --> 03:22:26,382
Dark!

2991
03:22:26,560 --> 03:22:27,584
Daddy! Dark!

2992
03:22:29,630 --> 03:22:32,360
It's all right.
Who put out that light? Nurse!

2993
03:22:32,433 --> 03:22:33,866
Daddy, dark!

2994
03:22:35,169 --> 03:22:36,261
Daddy, dark!

2995
03:22:36,337 --> 03:22:37,998
There. Yes, yes.

2996
03:22:38,572 --> 03:22:40,403
What's the matter with my Bonnie?

2997
03:22:40,541 --> 03:22:41,838
A bear.

2998
03:22:42,276 --> 03:22:44,540
Oh, a bear? A big bear?

2999
03:22:45,012 --> 03:22:47,913
Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.

3000
03:22:48,015 --> 03:22:51,314
Well, I'll stay here and shoot him
if he comes back.

3001
03:23:06,534 --> 03:23:08,161
Good evening, Mr. Butler.

3002
03:23:11,372 --> 03:23:14,102
Haven't I told you never to leave her alone
in the dark?

3003
03:23:14,175 --> 03:23:18,134
If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often
afraid of the dark, but they get over it.

3004
03:23:18,212 --> 03:23:19,907
If you just let her scream
for a night or two.

3005
03:23:19,980 --> 03:23:23,973
Let her scream! Either you're a fool or
the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!

3006
03:23:24,051 --> 03:23:26,645
Of course, sir, if you want her
to grow up nervous and cowardly.

3007
03:23:26,721 --> 03:23:27,710
Cowardly!

3008
03:23:27,922 --> 03:23:31,289
There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.
You're discharged!

3009
03:23:32,193 --> 03:23:33,353
As you say, sir.

3010
03:23:50,378 --> 03:23:51,868
Where is Mother?

3011
03:23:58,419 --> 03:24:00,546
Aren't you happy here in London with me?

3012
03:24:01,222 --> 03:24:03,713
I want to go home.

3013
03:24:15,903 --> 03:24:17,268
Miss Bonnie!

3014
03:24:17,571 --> 03:24:19,436
And Captain Butler!

3015
03:24:19,774 --> 03:24:21,605
-Miss Scarlett!
-Hello, Mammy.

3016
03:24:21,876 --> 03:24:23,104
Honey, child!

3017
03:24:24,512 --> 03:24:27,310
Miss Scarlett! They's back!
They's back, Miss Scarlett!

3018
03:24:27,481 --> 03:24:28,539
Bonnie!

3019
03:24:29,617 --> 03:24:31,517
Bonnie! Bonnie, baby!

3020
03:24:31,852 --> 03:24:33,149
Darling, baby!

3021
03:24:33,220 --> 03:24:34,619
Are you glad to be home?

3022
03:24:34,688 --> 03:24:36,053
Daddy gave me a kitten.

3023
03:24:36,323 --> 03:24:39,588
-What a little, lovely kitten!
-London's a horrid place.

3024
03:24:40,127 --> 03:24:42,391
-Oh, my darling.
-Where's my pony?

3025
03:24:42,596 --> 03:24:45,793
-I want to go out and see my pony.
-You go out and see your pony.

3026
03:24:55,276 --> 03:24:56,436
Where's my pony?

3027
03:24:57,945 --> 03:24:59,674
I wanna go out and see my pony.

3028
03:25:00,414 --> 03:25:02,143
You run along with Mammy.

3029
03:25:02,216 --> 03:25:03,706
-Come on, honey child.
-Go with Mammy.

3030
03:25:03,784 --> 03:25:05,775
Mammy sure has missed you, honey.

3031
03:25:07,955 --> 03:25:09,388
Mrs. Butler, I believe.

3032
03:25:10,424 --> 03:25:11,914
Mammy said you'd come back.

3033
03:25:13,394 --> 03:25:14,884
But only to bring Bonnie.

3034
03:25:14,962 --> 03:25:18,363
Apparently any mother, even a bad one,
is better for a child than none.

3035
03:25:19,166 --> 03:25:20,929
You mean you're going away again?

3036
03:25:21,335 --> 03:25:22,893
What perception, Mrs. Butler.

3037
03:25:23,270 --> 03:25:24,362
Right away.

3038
03:25:24,505 --> 03:25:26,530
In fact, I left my bags at the station.

3039
03:25:28,676 --> 03:25:31,440
You're looking pale.
Is there a shortage of rouge?

3040
03:25:31,946 --> 03:25:34,437
Or can this wanness mean
you've been missing me?

3041
03:25:35,349 --> 03:25:36,907
If I'm pale, it's your fault.

3042
03:25:36,984 --> 03:25:39,384
Not because I've been missing you,
but because....

3043
03:25:43,724 --> 03:25:45,248
Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.

3044
03:25:46,460 --> 03:25:48,724
It's because I'm going to have a baby.

3045
03:25:54,768 --> 03:25:55,792
Indeed?

3046
03:25:56,270 --> 03:25:58,033
And who's the happy father?

3047
03:25:58,839 --> 03:26:00,067
You know it's yours.

3048
03:26:00,407 --> 03:26:02,204
I don't want it any more than you do.

3049
03:26:02,276 --> 03:26:04,437
No woman would want the child
of a cad like you.

3050
03:26:04,512 --> 03:26:07,208
I wish it were anybody's child but yours.

3051
03:26:09,183 --> 03:26:11,515
Well, cheer up.
Maybe you'll have an accident.

3052
03:26:26,133 --> 03:26:27,259
Is she better?

3053
03:26:31,872 --> 03:26:33,271
Has she asked for me?

3054
03:26:33,340 --> 03:26:35,433
Don't you understand? She's delirious.

3055
03:26:36,977 --> 03:26:38,774
Rhett!

3056
03:26:40,047 --> 03:26:41,674
I want Rhett!

3057
03:26:45,953 --> 03:26:49,252
What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?

3058
03:26:49,423 --> 03:26:50,856
It's no use.

3059
03:26:52,126 --> 03:26:53,457
It's no use.

3060
03:27:15,516 --> 03:27:16,642
Dr. Meade's left.

3061
03:27:18,118 --> 03:27:19,312
Scarlett's dead!

3062
03:27:19,520 --> 03:27:21,249
Oh, no, she's much better.

3063
03:27:21,822 --> 03:27:22,880
Really she is.

3064
03:27:39,873 --> 03:27:42,501
There, there, Captain Butler.
You're beside yourself.

3065
03:27:43,043 --> 03:27:45,273
She'll very soon be well again,
I promise you.

3066
03:27:45,346 --> 03:27:48,315
No, you don't understand.
She never wanted this baby.

3067
03:27:48,515 --> 03:27:50,949
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby!

3068
03:27:51,085 --> 03:27:53,952
Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.
Not my children.

3069
03:27:54,355 --> 03:27:56,482
She told me she didn't want
any more children...

3070
03:27:56,557 --> 03:27:58,616
...and I wanted to hurt her
because she'd hurt me.

3071
03:27:58,692 --> 03:27:59,989
I wanted to and I did.

3072
03:28:00,060 --> 03:28:03,188
Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.
It's not fit.

3073
03:28:03,263 --> 03:28:06,096
I didn't know about this baby
until the other day when she fell.

3074
03:28:06,166 --> 03:28:09,158
If I'd known, I'd have come straight home
whether she wanted me or not!

3075
03:28:09,236 --> 03:28:10,828
Well, of course you would.

3076
03:28:11,038 --> 03:28:14,337
And then when she told me,
there on the steps, what did I do?

3077
03:28:14,908 --> 03:28:17,706
What did I say? I laughed and I said--

3078
03:28:17,778 --> 03:28:20,246
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.

3079
03:28:21,215 --> 03:28:23,649
Oh, but I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.

3080
03:28:23,984 --> 03:28:27,579
She's never cared for me. I thought I could
make her care, but I couldn't.

3081
03:28:29,556 --> 03:28:30,784
You're so wrong.

3082
03:28:31,191 --> 03:28:34,524
Scarlett loves you a great deal,
much more than she knows.

3083
03:28:36,130 --> 03:28:38,098
If that were only true I could wait forever.

3084
03:28:38,165 --> 03:28:40,360
If she'd only forgive me,
forget this ever happened.

3085
03:28:40,467 --> 03:28:41,456
She will.

3086
03:28:41,869 --> 03:28:43,461
You must be patient.

3087
03:28:45,873 --> 03:28:47,272
Oh, no, it's not possible.

3088
03:28:47,641 --> 03:28:50,667
You don't understand.
If you only knew who she really loved...

3089
03:28:51,779 --> 03:28:53,371
...you wouldn't believe it.

3090
03:28:56,650 --> 03:28:59,084
Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.

3091
03:28:59,319 --> 03:29:01,810
No, Captain Butler, I wouldn't believe it.

3092
03:29:03,891 --> 03:29:08,260
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well
and there can be other babies.

3093
03:29:08,562 --> 03:29:12,293
Oh no, no, she couldn't even if she
wanted to, after what she's been through.

3094
03:29:12,366 --> 03:29:14,334
But of course she could.

3095
03:29:14,868 --> 03:29:16,267
I'm going to.

3096
03:29:19,206 --> 03:29:22,437
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.

3097
03:29:22,910 --> 03:29:25,504
Children are life renewing itself,
Captain Butler...

3098
03:29:26,046 --> 03:29:29,538
...and when life does that
danger seems very unimportant.

3099
03:29:32,653 --> 03:29:35,383
I've never before known anyone
who was really brave.

3100
03:29:36,523 --> 03:29:39,014
I pray God things go well with you,
Miss Melly.

3101
03:29:39,626 --> 03:29:43,118
And I want to thank you for all
you've done for me and for Scarlett.

3102
03:29:44,598 --> 03:29:46,259
From my heart, I thank you.

3103
03:29:53,340 --> 03:29:56,002
Miss Scarlett's feelin' a heap better today,
Mr. Rhett.

3104
03:29:56,710 --> 03:29:57,870
Thank you, Mammy.

3105
03:30:05,385 --> 03:30:07,376
I've come to ask your forgiveness...

3106
03:30:07,721 --> 03:30:10,622
...in the hope that we can give
our life together another chance.

3107
03:30:10,691 --> 03:30:11,919
Our life together?

3108
03:30:12,359 --> 03:30:14,452
When did we ever have a life together?

3109
03:30:15,796 --> 03:30:16,990
Yes, you're right.

3110
03:30:17,931 --> 03:30:21,389
But I'm sure if we could only try again,
we could be happy.

3111
03:30:22,102 --> 03:30:24,366
Well, what is there to make us happy now?

3112
03:30:25,305 --> 03:30:27,466
Well, there's Bonnie and...

3113
03:30:28,509 --> 03:30:30,136
...and I love you, Scarlett.

3114
03:30:30,811 --> 03:30:32,335
When did you discover that?

3115
03:30:32,646 --> 03:30:36,013
I've always loved you, but you've never
given me a chance to show it.

3116
03:30:37,718 --> 03:30:40,152
Well, and just what do you want me to do?

3117
03:30:41,989 --> 03:30:44,150
To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.

3118
03:30:44,992 --> 03:30:46,152
We'll go away.

3119
03:30:46,226 --> 03:30:48,319
We'll take Bonnie and we'll have
another honeymoon.

3120
03:30:48,395 --> 03:30:51,262
Give up the mill? But why?
It's making more money than ever.

3121
03:30:51,331 --> 03:30:53,265
Yes, I know, but we don't need it.

3122
03:30:53,333 --> 03:30:55,824
Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.

3123
03:30:56,436 --> 03:30:58,165
Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.

3124
03:30:58,238 --> 03:31:00,968
Always Melanie!
lf you'd only think a little more about me....

3125
03:31:01,041 --> 03:31:02,372
I am thinking of you...

3126
03:31:03,544 --> 03:31:05,341
...and I'm thinking that...

3127
03:31:05,546 --> 03:31:08,777
...well, maybe it's the mill
that's taken you away from me...

3128
03:31:09,216 --> 03:31:10,547
...and from Bonnie.

3129
03:31:10,617 --> 03:31:13,381
I know what you're thinking.
Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.

3130
03:31:13,453 --> 03:31:15,114
You're the one taking her away from me.

3131
03:31:15,189 --> 03:31:16,349
But she loves you.

3132
03:31:16,423 --> 03:31:18,857
You've done everything possible
to make her love you and not me.

3133
03:31:18,926 --> 03:31:20,188
Why, she's so spoiled now that--

3134
03:31:20,260 --> 03:31:21,591
Mommy! Daddy!

3135
03:31:21,995 --> 03:31:22,984
Watch me!

3136
03:31:23,564 --> 03:31:24,588
We're watching, darling.

3137
03:31:25,399 --> 03:31:27,162
You're mighty pretty, precious.

3138
03:31:27,434 --> 03:31:28,696
So are you.

3139
03:31:29,102 --> 03:31:31,730
I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.

3140
03:31:32,472 --> 03:31:35,168
I don't think you ought to do
much jumping yet, Bonnie.

3141
03:31:35,242 --> 03:31:37,574
Remember, you've just learned
to ride sidesaddle.

3142
03:31:37,644 --> 03:31:38,975
I will so jump!

3143
03:31:39,079 --> 03:31:41,570
I can jump better than ever
'cause I've grown...

3144
03:31:42,049 --> 03:31:43,641
...and I've moved the bar higher.

3145
03:31:43,717 --> 03:31:45,082
Don't let her do it, Rhett.

3146
03:31:45,586 --> 03:31:49,682
No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,
don't cry and blame me.

3147
03:31:50,657 --> 03:31:52,147
Rhett, stop her!

3148
03:31:54,127 --> 03:31:55,253
Bonnie!

3149
03:31:56,063 --> 03:31:57,052
Bonnie!

3150
03:31:58,432 --> 03:31:59,558
Just like Pa.

3151
03:32:03,403 --> 03:32:04,529
Just like Pa!

3152
03:32:06,139 --> 03:32:07,231
Bonnie!

3153
03:32:15,816 --> 03:32:16,805
Bonnie!

3154
03:32:17,584 --> 03:32:18,551
Bonnie!

3155
03:32:35,068 --> 03:32:38,037
Lordsy, Miss Melly.
I sure is glad you has come.

3156
03:32:40,674 --> 03:32:43,575
This house won't seem
the same without Bonnie.

3157
03:32:43,644 --> 03:32:45,305
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?

3158
03:32:45,579 --> 03:32:48,412
Miss Melly, this here done
broke her heart...

3159
03:32:49,149 --> 03:32:51,743
...but I didn't fetch you here
on Miss Scarlett's account.

3160
03:32:51,818 --> 03:32:56,016
What that child got to stand,
the good Lord give her strength to stand.

3161
03:32:57,491 --> 03:32:59,516
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.

3162
03:33:03,330 --> 03:33:05,821
He done lost his mind
these last couple of days.

3163
03:33:05,933 --> 03:33:07,366
No, Mammy, no.

3164
03:33:07,834 --> 03:33:11,770
I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,
set such store on any child.

3165
03:33:12,572 --> 03:33:14,665
When Dr. Meade says her neck broke...

3166
03:33:15,042 --> 03:33:18,739
...Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there
and shoot that poor pony...

3167
03:33:19,713 --> 03:33:22,648
...and for a minute I think
he going to shoot hisself.

3168
03:33:22,816 --> 03:33:24,579
Oh, poor Captain Butler.

3169
03:33:24,651 --> 03:33:29,384
Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him
a murderer for teachin' that child to jump.

3170
03:33:29,890 --> 03:33:32,256
She say, "You give me my baby
what you kill."

3171
03:33:32,726 --> 03:33:36,457
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't
never cared nothin' about Miss Bonnie.

3172
03:33:36,997 --> 03:33:41,024
It like to turn my blood cold,
the things they say to one another.

3173
03:33:41,535 --> 03:33:43,594
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.

3174
03:33:46,807 --> 03:33:48,570
And then that night...

3175
03:33:49,609 --> 03:33:53,010
...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself
in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...

3176
03:33:54,214 --> 03:33:55,772
...and he wouldn't even open the door...

3177
03:33:55,849 --> 03:33:58,010
...when Miss Scarlett beat on it
and hollered to him.

3178
03:33:58,085 --> 03:34:00,349
And that's the way it's been
for two whole days.

3179
03:34:00,454 --> 03:34:01,648
Oh, Mammy.

3180
03:34:02,956 --> 03:34:06,084
And then this evenin',
Miss Scarlett, she shout through the door...

3181
03:34:06,393 --> 03:34:08,588
...and she say the funeral set
for tomorrow mornin'...

3182
03:34:08,662 --> 03:34:11,460
...and he says "You try that
and I kills you tomorrow.

3183
03:34:11,765 --> 03:34:14,359
"Do you think I's goin'
to put my child away in the...

3184
03:34:14,801 --> 03:34:16,632
"...in the dark when she's so scared of it?"

3185
03:34:17,137 --> 03:34:19,970
Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.

3186
03:34:20,040 --> 03:34:23,567
Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.
He ain't goin' to let us bury that child.

3187
03:34:23,643 --> 03:34:25,372
You gotta help us, Miss Melly.

3188
03:34:25,812 --> 03:34:27,370
Oh, but I can't intrude.

3189
03:34:27,514 --> 03:34:29,539
If you can't help us, who can?

3190
03:34:29,850 --> 03:34:32,375
Mr. Rhett always set great store
by your opinion.

3191
03:34:34,921 --> 03:34:36,115
Please, Miss Melly.

3192
03:34:38,258 --> 03:34:40,158
I'll do what I can, Mammy.

3193
03:34:46,833 --> 03:34:48,994
Get away from that door,
and leave us alone.

3194
03:34:49,336 --> 03:34:51,099
It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.

3195
03:34:51,438 --> 03:34:53,030
Please let me in.

3196
03:34:53,106 --> 03:34:54,698
I've come to see Bonnie.

3197
03:35:16,063 --> 03:35:17,087
Oh, Lord...

3198
03:35:17,864 --> 03:35:20,424
...please help Mr. Rhett
in this hour of his grief.

3199
03:35:32,846 --> 03:35:35,906
I want you to go and make
a good deal of strong coffee...

3200
03:35:36,149 --> 03:35:39,744
...and bring it up to Captain Butler.
I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.

3201
03:35:40,220 --> 03:35:41,118
But....

3202
03:35:41,621 --> 03:35:44,818
Captain Butler is quite willing
for the funeral to take place...

3203
03:35:44,991 --> 03:35:46,185
...tomorrow morning.

3204
03:35:46,259 --> 03:35:50,992
Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights
on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.

3205
03:35:52,299 --> 03:35:53,926
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

3206
03:35:54,768 --> 03:35:55,632
Miss Melly!

3207
03:35:55,735 --> 03:35:57,396
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

3208
03:35:59,139 --> 03:36:01,107
Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...

3209
03:36:01,808 --> 03:36:02,934
...and try...

3210
03:36:03,143 --> 03:36:04,804
...try to get me home.

3211
03:36:06,513 --> 03:36:08,071
Miss Melly! Miss Melly!

3212
03:36:15,922 --> 03:36:18,322
Where is my mother goin' away to?

3213
03:36:18,492 --> 03:36:21,393
And why can't I go along, please?

3214
03:36:21,928 --> 03:36:25,261
We can't always go along, Beau,
much as we may want to.

3215
03:36:26,967 --> 03:36:28,764
You're going back to bed now.

3216
03:36:29,803 --> 03:36:33,000
Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!

3217
03:36:33,740 --> 03:36:35,139
She hasn't your strength.

3218
03:36:35,208 --> 03:36:38,507
She's never had any strength.
She's never had anything but heart.

3219
03:36:39,012 --> 03:36:40,274
You knew that, too.

3220
03:36:40,514 --> 03:36:43,347
Why do I have to go back to bed?
It's morning.

3221
03:36:44,050 --> 03:36:46,075
It isn't really morning yet.

3222
03:36:52,325 --> 03:36:53,986
You may come in now, Scarlett.

3223
03:36:54,161 --> 03:36:55,492
Dr. Meade, please let me see her!

3224
03:36:55,562 --> 03:36:59,191
I've been waiting here two whole days
and I've got to tell her...

3225
03:36:59,666 --> 03:37:01,293
...that I was wrong about something.

3226
03:37:01,368 --> 03:37:04,030
She knows you were wrong.
She wants to see Scarlett.

3227
03:37:07,974 --> 03:37:09,908
Miss Melly's going to die in peace.

3228
03:37:09,976 --> 03:37:12,308
I won't have you easing your conscience
telling her things...

3229
03:37:12,379 --> 03:37:14,745
...that make no difference now.
You understand?

3230
03:37:29,930 --> 03:37:31,022
It's me, Melly.

3231
03:37:32,866 --> 03:37:33,992
Promise me?

3232
03:37:35,068 --> 03:37:36,057
Anything.

3233
03:37:37,337 --> 03:37:39,100
Look after my little son.

3234
03:37:40,507 --> 03:37:42,771
I gave him to you once before.

3235
03:37:43,877 --> 03:37:45,344
Remember?

3236
03:37:46,213 --> 03:37:47,612
The day he was born.

3237
03:37:48,148 --> 03:37:51,447
Please, Melly, don't talk this way.
I know you'll get well.

3238
03:37:52,285 --> 03:37:53,274
Promise me...

3239
03:37:54,187 --> 03:37:55,245
...college....

3240
03:37:55,355 --> 03:37:59,553
Yes, yes, and Europe, and a pony,
whatever he wants. But...

3241
03:38:00,727 --> 03:38:01,955
...Melly, do try....

3242
03:38:02,362 --> 03:38:03,329
Ashley....

3243
03:38:05,398 --> 03:38:06,558
Ashley and you.

3244
03:38:09,202 --> 03:38:11,966
What about Ashley, Melly?

3245
03:38:13,473 --> 03:38:15,668
Look after him for me.

3246
03:38:16,443 --> 03:38:17,637
Just as you...

3247
03:38:19,112 --> 03:38:20,670
...looked after me for him.

3248
03:38:24,651 --> 03:38:25,743
I will, Melly.

3249
03:38:27,354 --> 03:38:29,686
Look after him...

3250
03:38:29,756 --> 03:38:32,657
...but never let him know.

3251
03:38:42,736 --> 03:38:43,794
Good night.

3252
03:38:45,705 --> 03:38:46,694
Promise?

3253
03:38:48,375 --> 03:38:49,603
What else, Melly?

3254
03:38:50,844 --> 03:38:52,607
Captain Butler...

3255
03:38:54,014 --> 03:38:55,481
...be kind to him.

3256
03:38:56,182 --> 03:38:57,206
Rhett?

3257
03:38:58,018 --> 03:38:59,645
He loves you so.

3258
03:39:03,790 --> 03:39:04,916
Yes, Melly.

3259
03:39:08,128 --> 03:39:09,254
Goodbye.

3260
03:39:10,764 --> 03:39:11,788
Goodbye.

3261
03:39:28,014 --> 03:39:29,538
You ladies may come in now.

3262
03:39:35,555 --> 03:39:36,886
Ashley.

3263
03:39:37,757 --> 03:39:40,351
I don't know where the mate to this is.

3264
03:39:41,328 --> 03:39:42,955
She must have put it away.

3265
03:39:44,097 --> 03:39:45,496
Oh, stop it.

3266
03:39:46,066 --> 03:39:47,158
Hold me.

3267
03:39:47,567 --> 03:39:49,159
I'm so frightened.

3268
03:39:51,004 --> 03:39:52,471
I'm so frightened.

3269
03:39:57,577 --> 03:40:01,104
Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?
I can't live without her, I can't.

3270
03:40:02,749 --> 03:40:04,216
Everything I ever had is...

3271
03:40:04,718 --> 03:40:06,208
...is going with her.

3272
03:40:07,420 --> 03:40:08,682
Oh, Ashley.

3273
03:40:10,190 --> 03:40:12,124
You really love her, don't you?

3274
03:40:12,926 --> 03:40:17,625
She's the only dream I ever had
that didn't die in the face of reality.

3275
03:40:18,531 --> 03:40:21,500
Dreams! Always dreams with you,
never common sense.

3276
03:40:21,768 --> 03:40:24,259
Oh, Scarlett!
lf you knew what I've gone through!

3277
03:40:25,905 --> 03:40:29,671
Ashley, you should have told me years ago
that you loved her and not me...

3278
03:40:30,076 --> 03:40:33,011
...and not left me dangling
with your talk of honor.

3279
03:40:33,113 --> 03:40:36,310
But you had to wait till now,
now when Melly's dying...

3280
03:40:37,250 --> 03:40:40,185
...to show me that I could never mean
any more to you than...

3281
03:40:40,687 --> 03:40:42,814
...than this Watling woman does to Rhett.

3282
03:40:45,191 --> 03:40:47,022
And I've loved something that...

3283
03:40:47,894 --> 03:40:49,794
...that doesn't really exist.

3284
03:40:52,465 --> 03:40:53,693
Somehow...

3285
03:40:55,034 --> 03:40:56,399
...l don't care.

3286
03:40:57,937 --> 03:40:59,632
Somehow it doesn't matter.

3287
03:41:01,775 --> 03:41:03,402
It doesn't matter one bit.

3288
03:41:08,515 --> 03:41:10,039
Ashley, forgive me.

3289
03:41:10,750 --> 03:41:13,651
Don't cry.
She mustn't see you've been crying.

3290
03:41:14,187 --> 03:41:15,313
Ashley!

3291
03:41:18,858 --> 03:41:20,155
Melly!

3292
03:41:22,028 --> 03:41:23,359
Melly!

3293
03:41:27,801 --> 03:41:29,792
Rhett, Rhett!

3294
03:41:33,239 --> 03:41:34,570
Rhett, where are you?

3295
03:41:39,112 --> 03:41:40,545
Rhett, wait for me.

3296
03:41:45,618 --> 03:41:47,085
Rhett, wait for me!

3297
03:42:14,414 --> 03:42:15,574
Rhett.

3298
03:42:18,751 --> 03:42:19,843
Come in.

3299
03:42:27,861 --> 03:42:28,919
Rhett....

3300
03:42:29,596 --> 03:42:31,154
Melanie, she's....

3301
03:42:34,901 --> 03:42:36,061
Well, God rest her.

3302
03:42:36,836 --> 03:42:39,669
She was the only completely kind person
I ever knew.

3303
03:42:40,707 --> 03:42:42,038
A great lady.

3304
03:42:42,475 --> 03:42:43,669
A very great lady.

3305
03:42:46,513 --> 03:42:49,914
So she's dead.
That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?

3306
03:42:50,884 --> 03:42:54,615
Oh, how can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really!

3307
03:42:55,955 --> 03:42:57,445
No, I don't know that I do.

3308
03:42:57,991 --> 03:43:01,222
But at least it's to your credit
that you could appreciate her at the end.

3309
03:43:01,294 --> 03:43:04,593
Of course I appreciated her.
She thought of everybody except herself.

3310
03:43:05,865 --> 03:43:07,696
Why her last words were about you.

3311
03:43:08,902 --> 03:43:10,062
What did she say?

3312
03:43:10,370 --> 03:43:11,530
She said:

3313
03:43:11,938 --> 03:43:14,463
"Be kind to Captain Butler.
He loves you so."

3314
03:43:20,680 --> 03:43:21,840
Did she say anything else?

3315
03:43:21,915 --> 03:43:23,405
She said...

3316
03:43:23,983 --> 03:43:26,349
...she asked me to look after Ashley, too.

3317
03:43:28,755 --> 03:43:31,849
It's convenient to have
the first wife's permission, isn't it?

3318
03:43:34,227 --> 03:43:35,387
What do you mean?

3319
03:43:38,298 --> 03:43:39,458
What are you doing?

3320
03:43:39,999 --> 03:43:41,523
I'm leaving you, my dear.

3321
03:43:41,901 --> 03:43:45,530
All you need now is a divorce,
and your dreams of Ashley can come true.

3322
03:43:48,841 --> 03:43:50,399
Oh, no!

3323
03:43:51,144 --> 03:43:53,374
No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!

3324
03:43:53,613 --> 03:43:56,741
I don't want a divorce.
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...

3325
03:43:56,849 --> 03:43:59,409
...when I knew I loved you,
I ran home to tell you.

3326
03:43:59,485 --> 03:44:01,385
Oh, darling, darling....

3327
03:44:01,554 --> 03:44:03,146
Please don't go on with this.

3328
03:44:03,222 --> 03:44:06,851
Leave us some dignity to remember
out of our marriage. Spare us this last.

3329
03:44:06,926 --> 03:44:08,052
This last?

3330
03:44:08,428 --> 03:44:09,986
Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.

3331
03:44:10,196 --> 03:44:14,064
I must have loved you for years, only I was
such a stupid fool I didn't know it.

3332
03:44:14,133 --> 03:44:16,465
Please believe me. You must care.

3333
03:44:17,003 --> 03:44:18,265
Melly said you did.

3334
03:44:18,905 --> 03:44:21,430
I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?

3335
03:44:22,575 --> 03:44:24,338
I never really loved Ashley.

3336
03:44:25,378 --> 03:44:28,609
You certainly gave a good imitation of it,
up till this morning.

3337
03:44:29,916 --> 03:44:32,146
No, Scarlett. I tried everything.

3338
03:44:32,652 --> 03:44:35,553
If you'd only met me half way,
even when I came back from London.

3339
03:44:35,622 --> 03:44:39,285
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.

3340
03:44:39,392 --> 03:44:42,156
And then, when you were sick
and it was all my fault...

3341
03:44:42,695 --> 03:44:45,528
...l hoped against hope
that you'd call for me, but you didn't.

3342
03:44:45,598 --> 03:44:49,898
I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,
but I didn't think you wanted me.

3343
03:44:51,270 --> 03:44:55,297
It seems we've been at cross purposes,
doesn't it? But it's no use now.

3344
03:44:56,442 --> 03:44:59,570
As long as there was Bonnie,
there was a chance we might be happy.

3345
03:45:00,146 --> 03:45:01,875
I liked to think that Bonnie was you.

3346
03:45:01,948 --> 03:45:05,475
A little girl again, before the war,
and poverty had done things to you.

3347
03:45:06,386 --> 03:45:10,914
She was so like you, and I could pet her,
and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.

3348
03:45:13,026 --> 03:45:15,153
But when she went, she took everything.

3349
03:45:15,461 --> 03:45:16,485
Oh, Rhett!

3350
03:45:17,096 --> 03:45:18,927
Rhett, please don't say that.

3351
03:45:18,998 --> 03:45:21,694
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.

3352
03:45:23,936 --> 03:45:25,631
My darling, you're such a child.

3353
03:45:26,506 --> 03:45:30,169
You think that by saying, "l'm sorry,"
all the past can be corrected.

3354
03:45:33,212 --> 03:45:35,146
Here, take my handkerchief.

3355
03:45:35,782 --> 03:45:39,343
Never, at any crisis of your life,
have I known you to have a handkerchief.

3356
03:45:45,158 --> 03:45:46,989
Rhett, where are you going?

3357
03:45:47,126 --> 03:45:49,185
I'm going to Charleston.
Back where I belong.

3358
03:45:49,262 --> 03:45:51,230
Please. Please take me with you.

3359
03:45:52,265 --> 03:45:54,790
No. I'm through with everything here.

3360
03:45:55,601 --> 03:45:57,125
I want peace.

3361
03:45:57,336 --> 03:46:01,272
I want to see if somewhere there isn't
something left in life of charm and grace.

3362
03:46:02,375 --> 03:46:05,867
-Do you know what I'm talking about?
-No. I only know that I love you.

3363
03:46:06,813 --> 03:46:08,405
That's your misfortune.

3364
03:46:08,648 --> 03:46:09,672
Oh, Rhett.

3365
03:46:14,921 --> 03:46:15,910
Rhett!

3366
03:46:22,361 --> 03:46:23,453
Rhett!

3367
03:46:23,596 --> 03:46:26,565
If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?

3368
03:46:27,600 --> 03:46:29,830
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

3369
03:46:43,850 --> 03:46:46,284
Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!

3370
03:46:47,186 --> 03:46:49,780
There must be some way
to bring him back.

3371
03:46:52,458 --> 03:46:55,655
I can't think about it now.
I'll go crazy if I do!

3372
03:46:57,497 --> 03:46:59,431
I'll think about it tomorrow.

3373
03:47:13,913 --> 03:47:15,972
But I must think about it.

3374
03:47:16,616 --> 03:47:18,379
I must think about it.

3375
03:47:19,986 --> 03:47:21,453
What is there to do?

3376
03:47:22,889 --> 03:47:24,720
What is there that matters?

3377
03:47:27,894 --> 03:47:30,089
Do you mean to tell me,
Katie Scarlett O'Hara...

3378
03:47:30,163 --> 03:47:34,259
...that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?
Why, land's the only thing that matters.

3379
03:47:34,634 --> 03:47:36,727
It's the only thing that lasts.

3380
03:47:36,969 --> 03:47:40,632
Something you love better than me,
though you may not know it. Tara.

3381
03:47:40,840 --> 03:47:44,207
It's this from which you get your strength.
The red earth of Tara.

3382
03:47:44,544 --> 03:47:48,241
Why, land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.

3383
03:47:48,414 --> 03:47:51,645
Something you love better than me,
though you may not know it. Tara.

3384
03:47:51,717 --> 03:47:54,618
This from which you get your strength.
The red earth of Tara.

3385
03:47:54,687 --> 03:47:56,348
Why, land's the only thing that matters.

3386
03:47:56,422 --> 03:47:57,787
Something you love better than me.

3387
03:47:57,857 --> 03:47:59,085
The red earth of Tara.

3388
03:47:59,158 --> 03:48:00,785
-Tara!
-Tara!

3389
03:48:04,197 --> 03:48:05,255
Tara!

3390
03:48:06,699 --> 03:48:07,723
Home!

3391
03:48:09,068 --> 03:48:10,092
I'll go home!

3392
03:48:11,604 --> 03:48:14,232
And I'll think of some way to get him back.

3393
03:48:14,874 --> 03:48:16,239
After all...

3394
03:48:16,809 --> 03:48:18,740
...tomorrow...

3395
03:48:18,775 --> 03:48:20,005
... is another day!

3396
03:48:40,304 --> 03:48:44,290
