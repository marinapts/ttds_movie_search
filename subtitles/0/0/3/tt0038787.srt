1
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:34,790
Is there any legal reason why
sentence should not be pronounced?

2
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:37,710
-No, your honour.
-Yes, I've something to say.

3
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:39,837
You can put me away,
but you can't put away...

4
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:42,339
what's going to happen to you
and to this whole country...

5
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,925
Next time, we're going to...

6
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:52,600
It is the judgement of this Court
that the defendant, J. Huberman...

7
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:56,020
having found guilty of the crime of
treason against the United States...

8
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:59,690
by the jury of this Court for the
Southern District of Florida at Miami...

9
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:03,402
be committed to the custody of
the United States Attorney General...

10
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:06,614
for imprisonment in an institution of
the penitentiary type...

11
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:08,574
for a period of 20 years.

12
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:13,037
The defendant may be forthwith remanded
to the custody of the U.S. Marshall.

13
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:14,330
Court is now adjourned.

14
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:15,456
Here she comes!

15
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:22,004
Just a minute, Miss Huberman!
Look this way, would you, please?

16
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:25,925
We'd like a statement from you,
Miss Huberman, about your father.

17
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,260
Do you think your father got
what he deserved?

18
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:30,971
Are you pleased your father's going
to pay the penalty...

19
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:32,348
for being a German worker?

20
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,517
Let us know if she tries to leave town.

21
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,617
Would you care to pause for
some refreshments, Mr. Hopkins?

22
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:54,495
Alicia, were you really followed
by a policeman?

23
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:57,414
-It sounds exciting.
-I'm going to shoot it out with him.

24
00:02:57,498 --> 00:02:58,040
Had enough.

25
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:01,085
Don't be silly.
The important thing hasn't started yet.

26
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,420
Everybody down here's got
a stuffed fish hanging on the wall.

27
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:05,589
-Where do they get them?
-Never seen the fish.

28
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:10,010
How about you, handsome?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

29
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:13,389
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I like party-crashers.

30
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:15,849
He's not a party crasher.
I brought him.

31
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,603
I wouldn't mind being followed
by a cop.

32
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:23,065
I hate low, underhanded people like
policemen pussy-footing after you.

33
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,733
Of course, I'm a marked women, no?

34
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:27,486
I am liable to blow up
the Panama Canal any minute now.

35
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,655
-You want some ice in it?
-No, thank you.

36
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:32,157
It's not becoming for a girl
Iike you to be worried about cops.

37
00:03:32,283 --> 00:03:34,410
-You won't be tomorrow?
-Oh, really?

38
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:35,619
We sail at ten.

39
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:37,454
Really?
We just sail away?

40
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,331
Show me a fish and
I'll show you a liar.

41
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:42,084
What this party needs is
a little glam treatment.

42
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,045
We'd better start breaking up.
I have to be on board at nine.

43
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,299
One week in Havana and this whole
thing will have blown over.

44
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:51,260
-Do you love me, Commodore?
-You're a very beautiful woman.

45
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:53,470
I'll have another drink
to appreciate that.

46
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:55,264
-Where are you going?
-Fishing.

47
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,474
This time of night?
You're mad.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,727
-How about you, still drinking?
-There's no fish, day or night.

49
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:01,478
You know something? I like you.

50
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:05,274
-I'll see you on board at 9 o'clock.
-I've to think that over.

51
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:08,360
You don't have to pack.
We'll pick up some things in Havana.

52
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:11,071
I think I'll have to leave him here
to dry out, Alicia.

53
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,783
I'm sorry you have to go.
It's been a perfectly hideous party.

54
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:17,828
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

55
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,136
There's one more drink left.

56
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:36,639
-Shame about the ice.
-What ice?

57
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,183
-Gone.
-What's gone?

58
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:40,100
The ice.

59
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,520
Why do you like that song?

60
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,278
It's a lot of hooey.

61
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:58,160
There's nothing like a love song
to give you a good laugh.

62
00:04:58,285 --> 00:04:59,286
That's right.

63
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:06,794
-It's stuffy in here, isn't it.
-It might be.

64
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,295
What about...

65
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:13,133
we have a picnic?

66
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:15,553
Outside?

67
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:23,936
Yeah, it's too stuffy in here
for a picnic.

68
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:28,190
-Want to finish that?
-Shame to leave it.

69
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,239
You're quite a boy.

70
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:49,712
-My car is outside.
-Naturally.

71
00:05:51,338 --> 00:05:53,674
-Want to go for a ride?
-Very much.

72
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:58,596
What about your guests?

73
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:01,640
They'll crawl out
under their own steam.

74
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm going to drive.
That's understood.

75
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:15,821
-Don' you need a coat?
-You'll do me.

76
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,126
Wait a minute.

77
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,337
Let me put this on you,
you might catch cold.

78
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:52,233
-How am I doing?
-Not bad.

79
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:56,403
-Scared?
-No.

80
00:06:56,528 --> 00:07:00,574
-You're not scared of anything...
-Not too much.

81
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:08,999
-This fog gets me.
-it's your hair in your eyes.

82
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,383
What does the speedometer say?

83
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,219
Sixty-five.

84
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:29,019
I want to make it eighty and
wipe that grin off your face.

85
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,774
I don't like gentlemen
who grin at me.

86
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,245
A cop.

87
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:47,413
What?

88
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,582
A policeman is chasing us.

89
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,168
They make me sick.

90
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,258
He wants to talk to you.

91
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:03,470
Drunken driver.

92
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:06,390
A second offence.
Now, I go to jail.

93
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,476
Whole family in jail!
Who cares?

94
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,990
Having a time for yourself,
aren't you?

95
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:27,244
People like you ought to be in bed.

96
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:29,371
-Drunk, huh?
-Just a minute, officer.

97
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:32,208
No arguments, mister:
you ain't got a leg to stand on.

98
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,842
Sorry, but you didn't speak up.

99
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:42,968
That's all right.

100
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:45,471
-Sure you can handle it?
-No trouble.

101
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:47,014
Well, you ought to know.

102
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,315
Where's the ticket?

103
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,026
He didn't give me a ticket.

104
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:04,365
-What's your name?
-Devlin.

105
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,577
You showed that cop something.
He saluted you.

106
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:11,163
-Did he?
-I saw him.

107
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:15,584
You double-crossing buzzard!
You're a cop!

108
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:16,835
We'll argue that later.

109
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:20,798
-Get away from my car!
-I'm going to take you home.

110
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:23,008
You're not going
to take me home at all.

111
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,385
Move over!

112
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:28,180
Come on!

113
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,480
Get out of my car, Federal cop!
For crashing my party!

114
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:39,400
Just like that buzzard
with the glasses.

115
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,152
Give me alone. You're trailing me
to get something out of me.

116
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:47,408
You going to calm down?

117
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,871
-Good, now move over.
-No!

118
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:55,082
I'll kill you,
I'm not going to let...

119
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:17,563
You better drink that.

120
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,119
Why is this necessary?

121
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:34,830
Go on, drink it!

122
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:46,467
Finish it!

123
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,495
Feel better?

124
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:18,415
What do you care how I feel?

125
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:24,338
You, you cop...

126
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,855
What's this all about, huh?

127
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,651
-What's your angle?
-What angle?

128
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:48,862
-About last night.
-Just wanted to be friends.

129
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,532
Friends, yes.
So you could frame me, huh?

130
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:53,742
No, got a job for you.

131
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,953
Don't tell me, there's only...

132
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,586
There's only one job that you
coppers would want me for.

133
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,882
-You can forget it, Mr...
-Devlin.

134
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,508
-What?
-Devlin.

135
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm no stool-pigeon, Mr. Devlin.

136
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:16,640
My department authorised me to engage
you to do some work in Brazil.

137
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:18,934
Go away!
The whole thing bores me!

138
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,687
Some of the German gentry
who were paying your father...

139
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,188
are working in Rio.

140
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:26,442
We're going to help the Brazilian
government to smoke them out.

141
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,904
-My chief thinks that the daughter of...
-Of a traitor?

142
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,822
Well, he thinks you might be
valuable in the work.

143
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:33,407
They might sort of trust you.

144
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:36,577
And you could make up a little
for your daddy's peculiarities.

145
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:39,538
-Why should I?
-Patriotism.

146
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:42,166
That word gives me a pain.
No, thank you.

147
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:46,253
I don't go for patriotism
or patriots.

148
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:47,755
I could dispute that with you.

149
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,799
Waving the flag with one hand
and picking pockets with the other's.

150
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:52,343
That's your patriotism.

151
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:53,928
You can have it.

152
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:57,348
We've had your bungalow wired
for three months.

153
00:12:57,473 --> 00:13:00,059
Conversation between John
Huberman and daughter Alicia...

154
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:03,729
6:00 p.m. January 9, 1946,
at Miami Beach, Florida.

155
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:06,357
Some of the evidence
that wasn't used at the trial.

156
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:09,235
-I don't want to hear that.
-Relax, hard-boiled and listen.

157
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,531
it's for both of us.
There's a lot of money in it, Alicia.

158
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:16,825
I told you before Christmas
I wouldn't do it.

159
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,537
You can use your judgement.
You can have anything you want.

160
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:21,747
-The work is easy.
-I won't listen, father.

161
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,582
This is not your country, is it?

162
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,503
My mother was born here.
We have American citizenship.

163
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:30,339
Where's your judgement?
In your feelings you're German.

164
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:32,716
You've got to listen to me.
You don't know what we stand for.

165
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:36,512
I know what you stand for,
you and your murdering swine.

166
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:40,266
-I've hated you ever since I found out.
-My daughter don't talk to me like that.

167
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,977
-Don't ask me such a favour!
-Alicia, keep your voice down.

168
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:45,062
I hate you all.

169
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:49,608
I love this country.
Do you understand? I love it.

170
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,820
I'll see you all hang
before I raise a finger against it!

171
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:58,075
Now go on, get out of here.
Or so help me, I'll turn you in.

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,329
Don't ever come near me or speak to me
about your rotten schemes.

173
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:12,089
That doesn't prove much.
I didn't turn him in.

174
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,925
We didn't expect you to.

175
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:16,468
Well, what do you say?

176
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:22,308
Go away and leave me alone!

177
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:24,810
I've my own life to lead!

178
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:29,440
Good times, that's what I want.
And laughs, with people I like.

179
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:33,819
And no underhanded cops who want
to put me up in a shooting gallery...

180
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:35,654
but people of my own kind.

181
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:39,033
Who'll treat me right, and like me,
and understand me.

182
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,702
Good morning, Alicia.

183
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:43,621
Oh, hello!

184
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:46,749
Thought you might need a hand.
We're sailing with the tide, you know.

185
00:14:46,874 --> 00:14:48,584
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

186
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:52,004
-Don't tell me you've forgotten.
-Almost.

187
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,298
I'll help you pack, although
you really don't need anything.

188
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:57,134
-We've got everything on board.
-Thank you, I'll pack myself.

189
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:59,970
We're moored at the hotel pier,
you know the spot.

190
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,013
Yes.

191
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:03,515
You're a darling,
sweetest girl I ever knew.

192
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:06,143
See you soon!

193
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:11,607
What about it?
Plane leaves tomorrow morning early.

194
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:19,240
All right.
You'd better tell him.

195
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,613
-I'll tell her.
-See you later.

196
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:10,124
That's a very nice looking man.

197
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:12,418
You'll be seeing him in Rio.

198
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,671
Oh no, no.
I won't be seeing any men in Rio.

199
00:16:15,796 --> 00:16:18,716
Yes, you will.
That's our boss, Paul Prescott.

200
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:25,139
-Did he say anything about the job?
-No.

201
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,766
-No hints?
-No.

202
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,853
He had some news about your father
he picked up at the last stop.

203
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:34,064
-What about him?
-He died this morning.

204
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,529
Oh!

205
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:44,283
-How?
-Poison capsule.

206
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:47,203
-He did it himself?
-Yes, in his cell.

207
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:49,830
Sorry.

208
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,168
I don't know
why I should feel so bad.

209
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:58,505
When he told me a few years ago
what he was...

210
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:02,051
everything went to pot,
I didn't care what happened to me.

211
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:08,307
But now I remember how nice he was.
How nice we both were.

212
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:09,892
Very nice.

213
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,270
It's a very curious feeling.

214
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:16,982
As if something had happened to me
and not to him.

215
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:20,861
You see,
I don't have to hate him anymore.

216
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:24,531
-Or myself.
-We're coming into Rio.

217
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:29,078
Oh yes, we are.

218
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:55,771
I wonder if the embassy
can get me a maid?

219
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,899
It's a nice apartment and
I don't mind dusting and sweeping...

220
00:17:59,024 --> 00:17:59,775
but I hate cooking.

221
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,903
And while you're at it,
find out when I go to work and what.

222
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:03,696
Yes, madam.

223
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:06,490
-Care to have something else?
-Have another drink?

224
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,409
No, thank you, I've had enough.

225
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:09,952
I do.
Whisky and soda.

226
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:11,787
Well, do you hear that?

227
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,498
I'm practically on the wagon.
That's quite a change.

228
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:16,375
It's a phase.

229
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:21,714
-You don't think a woman can change?
-Sure, a change is fun.

230
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,674
-For a while.
-For a while.

231
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,719
What a rat you are, Devlin.

232
00:18:26,802 --> 00:18:29,221
All right, you've been sober
for eight days.

233
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,641
And as far as I know
you've made no new conquests.

234
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:34,268
Well, that's something!

235
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:37,980
Eight days,
practically white-washed.

236
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,190
I'm very happy, Devlin.

237
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,820
-Why don't you let me be happy?
-Nobody's stopping you.

238
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:51,952
Why don't you give
that copper's brain of yours a rest?

239
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:56,123
Every time you look at me
I can see it running over its slogans:

240
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:59,710
Once a crook, always a crook.
Once a tramp, always a tramp.

241
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:06,217
Go on, you can hold my hand.
I won't blackmail you for it afterwards.

242
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:07,843
Scared?

243
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:11,513
I've always been scared of women.
But I get over it.

244
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:13,933
Now you're scared of yourself.

245
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,060
You're afraid you'll fall in love
with me.

246
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,394
That wouldn't be hard.

247
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:19,188
Now, careful, careful.

248
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:21,357
You enjoy making fun of me,
don't you.

249
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:26,737
No, Devlin, I'm making fun of myself.

250
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:28,739
I'm pretending I'm
a nice unspoilt child...

251
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:31,367
whose heart is full of
daisies and buttercups.

252
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:34,245
Nice daydream.
Then what?

253
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,169
I think I'll have another drink.

254
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,338
I thought you'd get around to it!

255
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:45,673
Make it a double!

256
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,384
-Whisky and soda, double.
-Yes, sir.

257
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,888
Why won't you believe in me,
Devlin?

258
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:56,767
Just a little.

259
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,938
Why won't you?

260
00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:16,662
I know why you won't, Dev:
you're sore.

261
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:20,332
You're sore because you've fallen
for a little drunk you tailed in Miami.

262
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,627
And you don't like it,
it makes you sick all over, doesn't it?

263
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,380
People will laugh at you.
The invincible Devlin in love...

264
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,799
with someone who isn't worth
even wasting the words on.

265
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:32,386
Poor Devlin, in love with a no-good gal.
It must be awful, I'm sorry.

266
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:39,101
I assure you she's the perfect
type for the job.

267
00:20:39,226 --> 00:20:42,855
It's not the girl, it's this German
scientist I'm worried about.

268
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,442
I simply question why we don't find
some way of taking them into custody.

269
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,361
It' do no good, even if we arrested
their leader, Alex Sebastian...

270
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:52,114
tomorrow another foreign man
takes his place and the work goes on.

271
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:53,449
Yes, you're right.

272
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:57,286
I see, Captain Prescott,
your method is the best way.

273
00:20:57,411 --> 00:21:00,122
Well, she's good at making friends
with gentlemen...

274
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,750
and we want somebody inside
his house in his confidence.

275
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,878
-You've faith in this procedure?
-Yes, with somebody on the side...

276
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:08,422
-Have you consulted the young lady?
-No, not yet.

277
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:11,175
Our man Devlin just brought
her down here the other day.

278
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:13,928
Now we're waiting for Sebastian
to come back to Rio.

279
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,263
Has your man Devlin told her
the nature of the work?

280
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:18,307
No, we haven't discussed it
with him at all.

281
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:20,100
I can set your mind at rest about her.

282
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,061
You're sure of her political side?

283
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:22,978
Oh, yes.

284
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:27,816
Well, there is nothing to be lost
if we proceed as you advise.

285
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:30,653
That's fine. I'll give Devlin
his instructions right away.

286
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:29,962
it's nice out here!

287
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:34,383
Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.

288
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,051
We have to eat.

289
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:39,805
We can eat here.
I'll cook.

290
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:42,600
I thought you didn't like to cook.

291
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,352
No, I don't like to cook.

292
00:22:47,897 --> 00:22:50,357
But I have a chicken in the ice-box
and you're eating it.

293
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,943
What about all the washing up
afterwards?

294
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:55,195
We'll eat it with our fingers.

295
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:57,239
Don't we need any plates?

296
00:22:57,448 --> 00:23:00,492
Yes, one for you and one for me.

297
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:05,998
Do you mind if have dinner
with you tonight?

298
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,709
I'd be delighted.

299
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,629
-Where are you going?
-If we're going to stay in...

300
00:23:11,754 --> 00:23:14,381
I've to telephone the hotel
to see if there are any messages.

301
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:19,511
-You have to?
-I have to.

302
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,651
-This is a very strange love affair.
-Why?

303
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:38,322
Maybe the fact
that you don't love me.

304
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:40,032
Hello?

305
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:41,784
Paris Hotel?

306
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:43,202
Reception desk?

307
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,746
This is T.R. Devlin.
Are there any messages for me?

308
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,208
I don't love you.
How do you know?

309
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:51,710
You haven't said anything.

310
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:53,879
Actions speak louder than words.

311
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:57,091
There is?
Good, read it to me, please.

312
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:05,724
Thanks.

313
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,436
Prescott wants me over right away.

314
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:11,397
-Did he say what about?
-No.

315
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:15,150
-Maybe it's our assignment.
-Probably.

316
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:25,828
Do you want me
to bring anything back?

317
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:30,165
Yes, what about
a nice bottle of wine to celebrate?

318
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,585
What time shall I come back?

319
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,503
Seven o'clock.

320
00:24:38,591 --> 00:24:40,551
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

321
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:01,614
-What is it, Devlin, what's the matter?
-I don't know if she'll do it.

322
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,283
What do you mean? You haven't
discussed it with her, have you?

323
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:06,702
No, I didn't know what the job was
until this moment.

324
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:09,914
-What do you mean she wouldn't do it?
-She's not that type of woman.

325
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,665
I don't understand your attitude.

326
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,962
-Why do you think she won't do it?
-Well, she's had no experience.

327
00:25:17,046 --> 00:25:19,506
Come on, what experience
does she lack, do you think?

328
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:23,260
She's never been trained for that...
They'll see through her.

329
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:24,929
Alicia Huberman was chosen...

330
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:27,264
not only because her father gives
her an ideal background...

331
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:29,099
but because Sebastian knows her.

332
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:31,644
Yes.

333
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:33,354
He was once in love with her.

334
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:37,024
Oh, I didn't know that.

335
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:39,693
I don't know why we're arguing
about petty things like this.

336
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:42,613
We've got important work to do.
Sebastian's house is a cover-up.

337
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:45,991
We've got to get Miss Huberman inside
and find out what's going on there.

338
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:49,954
I' think you'd better go back to Miss
Huberman and explain it to her.

339
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,830
-I...
-What is it?

340
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:53,707
Nothing, sir.

341
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,793
I thought you were going
to say something.

342
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:57,628
How is the meeting to be arranged?

343
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:01,090
We've discussed that.
The riding club would be the best place.

344
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:04,301
Sebastian usually rides there
in the mornings.

345
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,845
The rest is up to you
and Miss Huberman.

346
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:11,267
-Okay, Devlin, that's all.
-All right.

347
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:25,322
-Dev, is that you?
-Huh?

348
00:26:25,698 --> 00:26:26,699
I'm glad you're late.

349
00:26:26,824 --> 00:26:28,742
This chicken took longer
than I expected.

350
00:26:29,076 --> 00:26:30,327
What did they say?

351
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:35,124
I hope it isn't done too much.
It caught fire once.

352
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,502
I think it's better
if I cut it up out here.

353
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,921
Unless you want
a half of one for yourself.

354
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:44,341
We're going to have
knives and forks after all.

355
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:46,719
I've decided
we're going to eat in style.

356
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:50,764
Marriage must be wonderful with
this sort of thing going on every ay.

357
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,268
I wonder if it's too cold out here.

358
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:55,936
Maybe we should eat inside.

359
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:03,360
Hasn't something like this
happened before?

360
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:07,489
What's the matter?

361
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,493
Don't look so tense.
Troubles?

362
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:15,706
Well, I think you'd better tell Mamma
what's going on.

363
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:17,917
All this secrecy's going to ruin
my little dinner.

364
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,963
Come on, Mr. D.,
what is darkening your brow?

365
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:25,591
-After dinner.
-No, now.

366
00:27:27,551 --> 00:27:28,844
I'll make it easy for you.

367
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:30,888
The time has come
when you must tell me...

368
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:33,140
you have a wife
and two adorable children.

369
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:35,809
And this madness between us
can't go on any longer.

370
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:38,187
I bet you've heard that line
often enough.

371
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:43,734
Right below the belt every time.

372
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:47,446
That isn't fair, Dev.

373
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:48,405
Skip it.

374
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:51,700
We've other things to talk about.
We've got a job.

375
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:55,287
Oh, so, there's a job.

376
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,750
You remember a man named
Sebastian?

377
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:03,087
-Alex Sebastian?
-Yes.

378
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:06,382
One of my father's friends, yes.

379
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:09,468
He had quite a crush on you.

380
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:11,220
I wasn't very responsive.

381
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:16,642
He's here at the head of a large
German business concern.

382
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:19,520
-His family always had money.
-He's part of the combine that...

383
00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:22,106
built up the German war machine
and wants to keep it going.

384
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,441
-Something big?
-It has all the earmarks of being it!

385
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:27,403
We've to contact him.

386
00:28:43,252 --> 00:28:45,004
Go on, let's have all of it.

387
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:48,132
We're meeting him tomorrow.
The rest is up to you.

388
00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:50,843
You've got to work on him
and land him.

389
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:55,598
Mata Hari!
She makes love for papers.

390
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:57,391
There are no papers.

391
00:28:57,516 --> 00:29:00,603
You'll land him, Find out what's
going on inside his house...

392
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:02,938
what the group around him is up to
and report to us.

393
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:09,820
I suppose you knew about this pretty
Iittle job of mine all the time.

394
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:13,282
No, I only just found out about it.

395
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:16,368
Well, did you say anything?

396
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:22,333
I mean, that maybe I wasn't the girl
for such shenanigans?

397
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,711
I figured that was up to you.
If you'd care to back out...

398
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:27,588
I suppose you told them
Alicia Huberman...

399
00:29:27,713 --> 00:29:30,090
will have this Sebastian eating out
of her hand in a couple of weeks.

400
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:31,842
She's good at that, always was.

401
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,385
I didn't say anything.

402
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:41,602
Not a word for that little love-sick
Iady you left an hour ago.

403
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,521
I told you that's the assignment.

404
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:47,274
Well now, don't get sore, Dev.

405
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:52,863
I'm only fishing for a little bird-call
from my dream man.

406
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:56,325
One little remark such as:

407
00:29:56,825 --> 00:30:00,037
How dare you gentlemen suggest
that Alicia Huberman...

408
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:03,666
the new Miss Huberman,
be submitted to so ugly a fate?

409
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,709
That's not funny.

410
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:15,094
-Do you want me to take the job?
-You're answering for yourself.

411
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:17,846
-I'm asking you.
-It's up to you.

412
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:22,893
Not a peep.

413
00:30:24,728 --> 00:30:27,398
Darling, what you didn't tell them,
tell me.

414
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:31,443
That you believe I'm nice, that I love
you and I'll never change back.

415
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:34,863
I'm waiting for your answer.

416
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:42,872
What a little pal you are.

417
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:47,960
Never believing me, huh?

418
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:49,712
Not a word of faith.

419
00:30:49,837 --> 00:30:52,756
Just down the drain with Alicia,
that's where she belongs.

420
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:57,511
Oh, Dev, Dev!

421
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,441
When do I go to work
for Uncle Sam?

422
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:11,525
Tomorrow morning.

423
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,457
We shouldn't have had this out here.
It's all cold now.

424
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,960
What are you looking for?

425
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:32,838
I had a bottle of champagne.
I must have left it somewhere.

426
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:44,975
In case you're asked,
I'm with Pan American Airways.

427
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,479
-As Devlin?
-Yes, Public Relations Officer.

428
00:31:49,104 --> 00:31:50,356
Anything else?

429
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:53,317
No, except we met on the plane
coming in from Miami.

430
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:54,902
The less detail the better.

431
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:09,542
-Are you sure that's him?
-Yes.

432
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,336
We'll go by him easy
and let him spot you. Come on.

433
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:42,658
I guess I'm the girl nobody remembers.

434
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:44,660
-Was it Sebastian?
-Yes.

435
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:46,745
We'll stick around:
give him another chance.

436
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:35,794
My dear Alicia,
will you forgive me for being late?

437
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:38,464
Last minute conference at the office.
You got my message?

438
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:41,342
-Yes, it's all right, Alex.
-It was sweet of you to wait.

439
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:44,637
-I was afraid you might run off.
-Oh, I'm not that easily put off.

440
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:47,139
I was too anxious to meet you again.

441
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:49,308
You know, I'm tired.

442
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:52,561
The worst thing about business is
it makes you feel old and look old.

443
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,730
You seem to have escaped all of that.

444
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:57,149
Four years of dullness
and disintegration.

445
00:33:57,274 --> 00:33:58,067
Awful!

446
00:33:58,317 --> 00:34:00,444
Alex, you look younger
than you did in Washington.

447
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:03,781
It's a temporary improvement,
entirely due to your presence.

448
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:06,200
You always affected me like a tonic.

449
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:09,036
But perhaps now
with you here in Rio...

450
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:11,455
unless you insist on running away
from me again...

451
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:15,167
-Oh, would you like another drink?
-Yes, thank you.

452
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,502
Two martinis.

453
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,010
Do you know him?

454
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:28,097
No, I don't think so,
but he seems familiar.

455
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:30,599
Captain Prescott,
intelligence man.

456
00:34:30,724 --> 00:34:32,601
He's down here as part
of the Washington espionage.

457
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,853
The American Embassy's
Ioaded with them.

458
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:35,896
Really?

459
00:34:37,189 --> 00:34:39,024
He's really handsome, isn't he?

460
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:40,693
I'm allergic to American agents.

461
00:34:41,694 --> 00:34:44,321
Their fine points don't particularly
appeal to me.

462
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:46,448
They've bothered you since you
came down?

463
00:34:46,824 --> 00:34:48,909
No, no, not yet.

464
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,162
They were troublesome in Miami?

465
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,708
Yes, that's why I left right after
the trial:

466
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,334
to get away from their snooping.

467
00:34:58,043 --> 00:34:59,795
I wondered why you left your father.

468
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:04,383
He insisted.
He was so unselfish.

469
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:06,594
He kept worrying about me
and begging me to leave.

470
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:10,055
I had no idea he was going to die.

471
00:35:10,222 --> 00:35:14,143
Many things have died for all of us.
We mustn't let our spirit die with them.

472
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:19,273
Perhaps I can help you to forget.
I'd like to.

473
00:35:20,482 --> 00:35:21,692
Well, it's odd...

474
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:26,113
but I feel at home with you.

475
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:27,907
You know, my dear...

476
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:31,076
I knew this was going to happen.

477
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,120
I knew when we met the other day...

478
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:35,331
that if I... saw you again...

479
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:36,916
I'd feel what I used to for you.

480
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,835
The same hunger.

481
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:42,922
You're so lovely, my dear.

482
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:46,342
Now I'm going to make
a fool of myself again.

483
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:48,427
There's someone else, of course.
Who is it this time?

484
00:35:49,386 --> 00:35:51,472
That Mr Devlin you were with?

485
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:52,848
There is no-one.

486
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:55,434
He seemed attentive.

487
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:00,773
Mr. Devlin has pestered me with his
attentiveness ever since I arrived..

488
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:02,816
I met him on the plane from Miami.

489
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:04,568
You made a pretty couple.

490
00:36:04,693 --> 00:36:08,239
Oh, Alex!
Mr. Devlin doesn't interest me.

491
00:36:09,406 --> 00:36:10,991
I was so lonely that day...

492
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:13,744
I could have gone riding
with Peter Rabbit.

493
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:17,331
You'll let me help your loneliness?

494
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:23,295
You're very sweet to forget
what a brat I was once.

495
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,215
My dear, I shall test out your
repentance.

496
00:36:26,715 --> 00:36:28,425
At once.

497
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:30,803
Will you have dinner with me again
tomorrow night?

498
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:33,597
-Thank you very much.
-My house?

499
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,725
Yes, how nice.

500
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,561
My mother's giving a dinner party.

501
00:36:38,686 --> 00:36:42,273
-She won't mind an extra guest?
-An old friend is never an extra guest.

502
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:48,612
-Well, shall we order now?
-Yes, yes, I'm starved.

503
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:49,780
Garon!

504
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:54,743
Let's see, what shall we have
for our first dinner together?

505
00:37:08,632 --> 00:37:11,010
-Good evening.
-Very good.

506
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:13,012
Yes, yes, isn't it?

507
00:37:13,512 --> 00:37:16,473
I'd like you to wear these.
They're rented for the occasion.

508
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:23,647
-Would you help me please, I can't...
-What? Yes, certainly.

509
00:37:24,064 --> 00:37:24,982
Thank you.

510
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:28,736
-So, the old boy knew me, eh?
-He thought you were very handsome.

511
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:31,530
Well, you don't say.
Sorry, I'm not going with you.

512
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:33,449
Oh, Dev will pick those up later.

513
00:37:33,574 --> 00:37:35,951
Try to memorise the names of all the
people you see there tonight.

514
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:36,869
The men, I mean.

515
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:39,288
And get their nationalities.
That's very important.

516
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:41,332
You mean the Germans?
That won't be difficult for me.

517
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:45,252
I suggest you don't ask any questions.
Just use your eyes and ears.

518
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:48,214
They're a keen and desperate bunch.
Don't underestimate them.

519
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:50,799
Thanks for your instructions.
Good evening.

520
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:53,802
By the way, unless you have
something very urgent to report...

521
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:56,680
I suggest you two keep shy of each
other for the next few days.

522
00:37:56,805 --> 00:37:59,642
Just in case Sebastian's people want
to check on you after your visit.

523
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:00,893
-I understand.
-Good luck.

524
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:02,144
Goodnight.

525
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:40,516
Good evening. I'm Miss Huberman,
would you tell Mr. Sebastian I'm here?

526
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:32,318
-Miss Huberman?
-Yes.

527
00:39:32,443 --> 00:39:34,570
Please forgive me
for keeping you waiting.

528
00:39:34,737 --> 00:39:35,905
Not at all.

529
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,575
You resemble your father very much.
I'm Alex's mother.

530
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:41,327
I knew when I saw you.

531
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:44,914
Alex has always admired you.
Now, at last, I know why.

532
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,498
You're very kind.

533
00:39:46,665 --> 00:39:49,543
We thought unusual that you did not
testify at your father's trial.

534
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:51,587
He didn't want me to.

535
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:54,215
He refused to let his lawyers
call me on the stand.

536
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,424
I wonder why?

537
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:58,385
Hello!
Alicia!

538
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:00,721
I'm so glad!

539
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:02,598
-You met my mother.
-Yes, we just met.

540
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:06,101
You didn't meet Alicia when we were in
Washington, did you mother?

541
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:09,396
-I don't know where you were then?
-I think we should join our guests.

542
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,985
-May I take your robe?
-Thank you.

543
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:29,166
Miss Huberman, may I present
Eric Mathis?

544
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:32,670
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

545
00:40:33,837 --> 00:40:35,548
William Rothman.

546
00:40:35,673 --> 00:40:36,549
How do you do?

547
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:38,968
Very honoured.

548
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:40,928
Emil Hupka.

549
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:42,972
How do you do?

550
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:45,933
Delighted.

551
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:47,560
And Mr. Nair.

552
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:52,982
And Dr. Anderson.

553
00:40:53,691 --> 00:40:55,192
Dr. Anderson.

554
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:57,111
it gives me great pleasure.

555
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,367
Dr. Anderson
is our Guest of Honour tonight.

556
00:41:03,492 --> 00:41:06,745
You mustn't bore Miss Huberman
with discourses on science.

557
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:08,706
Not before dinner, anyway.

558
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:10,332
Dinner is served, Madame.

559
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:16,714
Dr. Anderson, you will sit
beside me, over there.

560
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,717
Eric, you will sit
next to Miss Huberman.

561
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:22,344
You have just come from Spain,
Seora?

562
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:25,014
A few weeks ago.
It seems ages.

563
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:28,726
Travel does not mean anything
anymore, it goes so swiftly.

564
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:31,896
One has the feeling
of not going anywhere.

565
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,939
I suppose we can expect
the rocket ships...

566
00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:36,817
to be carrying us across
the oceans very soon.

567
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,403
We can expect many strange things.

568
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,656
-Did you see a good movie, Eric?
-No, I was disappointed.

569
00:41:42,823 --> 00:41:46,035
It must have been a comedy.
Eric loves to go to the movies to cry.

570
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,661
He's very sentimental.

571
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:12,728
I'm afraid, gentlemen, that
something must be done about Emil.

572
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:14,396
I don't know.

573
00:42:15,564 --> 00:42:18,400
It was an understandable slip:
the man was tired.

574
00:42:18,525 --> 00:42:21,570
No, it's a very dangerous slip.

575
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:24,406
It's not the first one.
There have been several other lapses.

576
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:26,534
There'll be more, if we permit it.

577
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:28,911
That's bad, that's very bad!

578
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:32,289
I think, gentlemen, you can leave it
to me to find some way.

579
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:35,334
When you drive up to Metropolis,
the road winds quite a bit.

580
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:39,338
It is very high.
There are some very awkward turns.

581
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:42,633
I'm sure I'll not have any difficulty...

582
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:44,593
in getting Emil
to give me a lift in his car.

583
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,512
It's quite a trick to jump clear.

584
00:42:47,846 --> 00:42:49,848
I'll just have to be careful,
that is all.

585
00:42:51,058 --> 00:42:52,768
Turned my ankle the last time.

586
00:43:02,653 --> 00:43:06,740
Madame says will you join the others
or will you take your coffee in here?

587
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:09,285
I think we'll take coffee in here,
Emil.

588
00:43:11,537 --> 00:43:15,583
I'm very sorry gentlemen,
to make such an exhibition.

589
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,418
Oh, nonsense!

590
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:19,003
We all have nerves!

591
00:43:19,795 --> 00:43:21,297
You've been overworking.

592
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:23,007
Don't you think so, Rothman?

593
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:25,259
You need a rest.

594
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:27,261
Your health is very important to us.

595
00:43:27,386 --> 00:43:30,306
That's very considerate.
I am very tired.

596
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:35,686
Now, I think perhaps if you'll make
my pardon to the ladies, Alex...

597
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:37,897
for my leaving so early, then I go...

598
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,858
I think maybe, Emil, it would be
better if I came with you.

599
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,944
If you try to drive yourself all the
way up to Metropolis...

600
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:45,404
it might be too much for you.

601
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:47,615
I shall drive you.

602
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:48,908
No!

603
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:52,786
It'd be too much for you all that way.
That's too much to ask.

604
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:54,955
Nonsense, I'd love to go!

605
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:56,165
Come on, Emil.

606
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,292
Goodnight, gentlemen.

607
00:43:58,417 --> 00:43:59,627
Goodnight, Alex.

608
00:44:00,294 --> 00:44:03,255
I hope you feel better
in the morning, Emil.

609
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:08,260
Thank you, and I'm very sorry
to make a scene before strangers.

610
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:09,303
Very sorry.

611
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:12,264
Thank you, Alex, for an excellent
dinner.

612
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:15,142
And please tell your mother from me
that the desert was superb.

613
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,864
Miss Huberman has been gone
a long time.

614
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:31,450
Is it necessary for you
to address Alicia as Miss Huberman?

615
00:44:31,575 --> 00:44:33,744
I do wish you'd be
a little more cordial to her.

616
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:36,080
Really?
I thought I was behaving very well.

617
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:38,582
Has she been complaining about
me?

618
00:44:38,707 --> 00:44:39,959
-No, no.
-I'm grateful.

619
00:44:40,084 --> 00:44:41,502
You might smile at her.

620
00:44:41,669 --> 00:44:44,964
Wouldn't it be a little too much
if we both grinned at her like idiots?

621
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:47,258
Please, mother,
I want to enjoy myself.

622
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:49,009
Is it so boring to sit with me alone?

623
00:44:49,218 --> 00:44:51,470
Not at all, not at all.

624
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,478
-Hello!
-Hello!

625
00:44:59,603 --> 00:45:00,938
-I thought I saw you.
-How are you?

626
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:02,815
Fine thanks.
Great turn out, isn't it?

627
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:04,358
Yes.

628
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:08,612
-Where are they?
-In a box in the stand.

629
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:10,781
I don't think they can see us,
Alex and his mother.

630
00:45:11,824 --> 00:45:14,743
Don't telephone me any more.
Just rely on my popping up.

631
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:17,955
-Can you hear me?
-Sure, go ahead.

632
00:45:18,914 --> 00:45:22,251
-Have you heard of Dr. Anderson?
-No.

633
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:26,505
He's some kind of a scientist:
kind face, sixty years old, grey hair.

634
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,591
Deep crease in the forehead.

635
00:45:29,383 --> 00:45:31,343
-Tall or short?
-Short.

636
00:45:32,177 --> 00:45:34,096
-Emil Hupka, heard of him?
-No.

637
00:45:36,348 --> 00:45:40,603
He made quite a scene about a wine
bottle the other night.

638
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,521
Didn't like the vintage?

639
00:45:42,646 --> 00:45:44,732
He seemed to think there was
something else in the bottle.

640
00:45:44,857 --> 00:45:48,402
-Was there?
-No, it was wine. We drank it.

641
00:45:49,904 --> 00:45:53,449
-Has he pulled anything since?
-Haven't seen him since.

642
00:45:55,326 --> 00:45:56,827
Anything else?

643
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:00,247
Nothing important.

644
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:03,751
Just a minor item, but you may
want it for the record.

645
00:46:03,876 --> 00:46:04,960
What is it?

646
00:46:05,419 --> 00:46:08,756
You can add Sebastian's name
to my list of playmates.

647
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:15,554
Pretty fast work.

648
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:17,514
-That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
-Skip it.

649
00:46:20,351 --> 00:46:22,811
-Are you betting on this race?
-No.

650
00:46:23,312 --> 00:46:25,397
Alex says number ten is sure to win.
He knows the owner.

651
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:26,899
Thanks for the tip.

652
00:46:26,982 --> 00:46:29,068
He says they've been holding him
back all season...

653
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:32,321
I can't help recalling some of your
remarks about being a new woman.

654
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:34,156
Daisies and buttercups, wasn't it?

655
00:46:34,615 --> 00:46:36,909
Oh, you idiot!
What are you sore about?

656
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:39,203
-You knew very well what I was doing.
-Did I?

657
00:46:39,328 --> 00:46:42,206
You could have stopped me with one
word, but you threw me at him.

658
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:43,832
I threw you at nobody.

659
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,668
Didn't you tell me to go ahead?

660
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:48,379
A man doesn't tell a woman what to do.
She tells herself.

661
00:46:48,712 --> 00:46:50,965
I almost believed in that little
hokey-pokey miracle of yours...

662
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,050
that a woman like you could ever
change her spots.

663
00:46:53,217 --> 00:46:54,635
Oh, you're rotten!

664
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,429
That's why I didn't try to stop you.
The answer had to come from you.

665
00:46:57,555 --> 00:47:00,641
-I see, some kind of love test.
-That's right.

666
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:03,978
You never believed in me anyway...

667
00:47:04,061 --> 00:47:07,064
Lucky for both of us I didn't.
It'd have been pretty if I'd believed.

668
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:09,400
If I'd figure: she'll never be able
to go through with this.

669
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:10,818
She can make it over by love.

670
00:47:12,278 --> 00:47:14,321
If you only once had said
that you loved me.

671
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:19,618
You chalked up another boyfriend
that's all, no harm done.

672
00:47:19,743 --> 00:47:20,661
I hate you!

673
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:23,080
There's no occasion to.
You're doing a good work.

674
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,415
Number ten's out in front.

675
00:47:24,498 --> 00:47:26,458
Looks as if Sebastian knows how to
pick them.

676
00:47:26,542 --> 00:47:28,419
Is that all you have to say to me?

677
00:47:29,503 --> 00:47:31,797
Dry your eyes, baby,
it's out of character.

678
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:35,259
Except keep on your toes.
It's a tough job we're on.

679
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:38,846
Snap out of it,
here comes dreamboat.

680
00:47:40,097 --> 00:47:43,559
Hello, Alex!
It was so exciting, a beautiful horse.

681
00:47:43,684 --> 00:47:45,936
-Do you remember Mr. Devlin, Alex?
-How do you do?

682
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,022
Hello, Alicia tells me
you had a bet on number ten.

683
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:50,357
Sorry I didn't get the tip earlier.
So long.

684
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,359
See you sometime, Dev.

685
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:55,237
It was a wonderful race.
Did you have much money on the winner?

686
00:47:55,362 --> 00:47:56,864
I didn't see the race,

687
00:47:57,031 --> 00:47:59,491
I thought I saw you looking
through your field glasses.

688
00:47:59,617 --> 00:48:01,952
I was watching you
and your friend, Mr. Devlin.

689
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:04,121
I suppose that's why you left
my mother and me.

690
00:48:04,496 --> 00:48:06,624
-You both had an appointment...
-Don't be absurd!

691
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:09,001
I met him purely by accident.

692
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:11,212
You didn't seem very anxious
to get away from him.

693
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:13,756
-Oh, he's just....
-I watched you.

694
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:16,800
I thought maybe you were in love
with him.

695
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,345
Don't talk like that.
I detest him.

696
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:22,223
Really?
He's very good-Iooking.

697
00:48:22,681 --> 00:48:23,641
Alex...

698
00:48:24,141 --> 00:48:27,102
I've told you before, Mr. Devlin
doesn't mean a thing to me.

699
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:28,812
I'd like to be convinced.

700
00:48:29,188 --> 00:48:31,523
Would you maybe care to convince
me, Alicia...

701
00:48:31,649 --> 00:48:34,151
that Mr. Devlin means
nothing to you?

702
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:41,534
...pleased to hear, Sr. Barbosa, that
our little theatrical plan is working.

703
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:43,786
We've got hold of something
concrete for a change.

704
00:48:43,911 --> 00:48:46,205
I'm delighted, gentlemen.
What is it?

705
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,166
Professor Otto Rensler is working
here in Brazil.

706
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:51,335
One of Germany's scientific wizards.

707
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:52,670
I didn't know he was here.

708
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:55,464
He's living and experimenting
in Sebastian's house.

709
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:57,132
They call him Doctor Anderson.

710
00:48:57,258 --> 00:48:58,425
Entre!

711
00:49:00,553 --> 00:49:01,595
Excuse me, sir.

712
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,015
Miss Huberman wishes to see
Captain Prescott or Mr. Devlin.

713
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:06,809
-Do you mean she's here?
-Yes, sir.

714
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:08,894
-Well, show her in, Hubero.
-Yes, sir.

715
00:49:09,687 --> 00:49:11,855
I don't like this.
I don't like her coming here.

716
00:49:11,939 --> 00:49:15,734
She's had me worried for some time.
A woman of that sort.

717
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:19,863
What sort is that, Mr. Beardsley?

718
00:49:19,989 --> 00:49:22,908
I don't think any of us have
any illusions about her character.

719
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:24,326
Not at all.
Not in the slightest.

720
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:27,246
Miss Huberman is first, last and
always not a lady.

721
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:29,498
She may be risking her life...

722
00:49:29,623 --> 00:49:31,292
but when it comes to being a lady...

723
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:33,377
she doesn't hold a candle
to your wife, sir...

724
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,795
sitting in Washington...

725
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,298
playing bridge with three other
Iadies of great honour and virtue.

726
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:39,300
-Take it easy, Dev.
-Sorry.

727
00:49:39,425 --> 00:49:41,844
I think those remarks about my wife
are uncalled for.

728
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:43,971
Withdrawn.
Apologise, sir.

729
00:49:47,558 --> 00:49:50,185
-How do you do, Miss Huberman?
-How do you do?

730
00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:54,690
This is Mr. Beardsley
and Sr. Julio Barbosa. Sit down?

731
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:57,234
You have the esteem of my government,
seorita.

732
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,486
But we are worried about
your visiting this office.

733
00:49:59,612 --> 00:50:01,530
I promise not to break the rules
again...

734
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:03,991
but I need some advice
and I couldn't find Mr. Devlin.

735
00:50:04,366 --> 00:50:06,368
In fact, I need it before lunch.

736
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:07,912
Well, has something happened?

737
00:50:07,995 --> 00:50:10,664
Yes, something rather confusing.

738
00:50:11,457 --> 00:50:14,084
Mr. Sebastian has asked me
to marry him.

739
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,878
-What?
-Well, well.

740
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,175
He wants me to marry him right away.
I 'm to give him my answer at lunch.

741
00:50:21,717 --> 00:50:24,803
I don't know what the department
might think about such a step?

742
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:28,015
Are you willing
to go this far for us?

743
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:31,393
Yes, if you wish.

744
00:50:32,895 --> 00:50:34,521
What do you think of this, Devlin?

745
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:37,775
I think it's a useful idea.

746
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:40,402
You know the situation better
than any of us.

747
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:44,782
May I ask what inspired Alex
Sebastian to go this far?

748
00:50:46,242 --> 00:50:47,660
He's in love with me.

749
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:50,538
And he thinks you're in love with him?

750
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:55,125
Yes, that's what he thinks.

751
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,920
Gentlemen, it's the cream
of the chest.

752
00:51:00,756 --> 00:51:04,343
Then, it's all right?

753
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:08,681
Well, yes, I'd say so.

754
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:11,642
Of course,
it's a perfect marriage for us.

755
00:51:12,476 --> 00:51:14,645
There's only one thing:
won't it delay us a bit?

756
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,063
What do you mean?

757
00:51:16,814 --> 00:51:19,149
Mr. Sebastian is a very romantic
fellow.

758
00:51:19,275 --> 00:51:20,734
Isn't he, Alicia?

759
00:51:21,652 --> 00:51:22,736
Yes.

760
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,240
Then, he'll probably want to take
his bride away for a long honeymoon.

761
00:51:26,407 --> 00:51:29,034
-Won't that hold us up?
-Devlin's got a point here.

762
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:31,203
I don't know, I think we can
rely on Miss Huberman...

763
00:51:31,328 --> 00:51:33,038
to get back into the house quickly.

764
00:51:35,165 --> 00:51:37,293
Yes, I think I can manage that.

765
00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:41,130
Well, everything seems to be
nicely arranged.

766
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:43,507
I don't think you need me here
anymore, do you, Captain Prescott?

767
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:49,013
I do want to thank you,
Miss Huberman very much.

768
00:51:49,555 --> 00:51:52,141
So far everything has been managed
with great intelligence.

769
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:54,143
Yes, thank you very much.

770
00:51:54,935 --> 00:51:57,813
Are you sure she didn't come down
here to see you?

771
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:00,399
To capture the rich Alexander
Sebastian for a husband?

772
00:52:00,482 --> 00:52:02,234
Don't be absurd.
She didn't even know I was here.

773
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:04,236
Well, we'll discuss it more fully
tonight.

774
00:52:04,361 --> 00:52:06,030
We'll not discuss it tonight.

775
00:52:12,578 --> 00:52:15,372
All these carping questions are
the expression of your jealousy.

776
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:18,584
You've always been jealous of any woman
I've ever shown any interest in.

777
00:52:18,709 --> 00:52:20,836
In this case,
there is nothing more to discuss.

778
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:23,422
You mean you're going ahead
with this marriage?

779
00:52:25,299 --> 00:52:27,426
I mean that the wedding
will be next week.

780
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,637
It will be private.

781
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:34,058
We shall both be pleased
to have you present, if you wish.

782
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:06,465
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

783
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,050
-Madam!
-Good evening, Joseph.

784
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:11,178
It doesn't look very cheerful here.

785
00:53:11,303 --> 00:53:15,099
I'm sorry, Madame Sebastian wasn't
certain you would be back tonight.

786
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:16,433
Why not? I telegraphed her.

787
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,061
Madame Sebastian said
we were all to retire, sir.

788
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:21,146
Where is my mother?

789
00:53:21,272 --> 00:53:23,482
Madame Sebastian went to bed
very early, sir.

790
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:26,944
I'm sorry, dear, I'm afraid
this isn't a very bright homecoming.

791
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:28,988
-That's all right, Alex.
-What shall we do?

792
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:31,073
Shall we have Joseph arrange
a little food for us?

793
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,617
Not unless you want to.
I'm rather tired myself.

794
00:53:33,701 --> 00:53:35,286
We'll go right up, then.

795
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:36,954
-Goodnight, Joseph.
-Goodnight, Madam.

796
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,669
I'd like to have all my dresses
put out on the beds here.

797
00:53:43,794 --> 00:53:46,005
Don't hang anything up.
I like to know where everything goes.

798
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,007
Joseph, would you've the closets aired?

799
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:49,383
Yes, Madame.

800
00:53:55,431 --> 00:53:57,808
Oh, this isn't very large.
I'll need more room.

801
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:10,487
-This door is locked.
-That's used for a storeroom, Madame.

802
00:54:11,322 --> 00:54:14,158
-Oh, may I have the key?
-I do not have the keys, Madame.

803
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,701
Where are they?

804
00:54:15,826 --> 00:54:18,787
Madame Sebastian has charge
of all the house keys.

805
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,084
Do you know
where Mr. Sebastian is?

806
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,588
I think he's having a business
meeting in the study, Madame.

807
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:34,470
I miss Hupka.
He was a first-class metallurgist.

808
00:54:34,595 --> 00:54:36,388
Klieten is just as good.

809
00:54:36,513 --> 00:54:38,098
Such is your opinion.

810
00:54:38,224 --> 00:54:41,644
But I don't want to criticise.
What were you asking?

811
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:44,688
Oh, you want a report,
a written report.

812
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:48,234
Well, my friends, my work is done.

813
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:50,402
You've been successful?

814
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:52,738
Yes.

815
00:54:59,537 --> 00:55:02,498
-Oh, I'm very sorry.
-Oh, no, come on in.

816
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:04,416
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
I didn't know you were busy.

817
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,212
Some of the closets are locked.
Could you give me the keys?

818
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:10,589
I'm sorry.
I' d forgotten about the keys.

819
00:55:10,714 --> 00:55:12,633
Of course,
I'll get them for you at once.

820
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:22,101
I'll bring the keys to you
right away, my dear.

821
00:55:25,187 --> 00:55:27,356
Mother, Mother!

822
00:55:56,468 --> 00:55:58,762
Well, there they are.

823
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:01,265
I'm afraid I'm going to be busy
for the rest of the morning.

824
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,267
-See you at lunch.
-Thank you, dear.

825
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:21,160
Mr. Sebastian has the keys for this,
Madame.

826
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:23,370
It's the wine cellar.

827
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:39,220
Then, the wine cellar's the obvious
place to look.

828
00:56:40,846 --> 00:56:43,682
-Alex has the key to that.
-Then get it from him.

829
00:56:44,058 --> 00:56:45,559
Get it. Yes, how?

830
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,937
Don't you live near him?

831
00:56:50,439 --> 00:56:52,274
What do I look for if I get the key?

832
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:55,653
You look for a bottle of wine,
Iike the one that rattled that fellow.

833
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,406
All the bottles look alike to me.
I'm no mastermind.

834
00:57:00,908 --> 00:57:02,326
You're doing all right.

835
00:57:04,745 --> 00:57:06,580
It's no fun, Dev.

836
00:57:08,582 --> 00:57:10,417
Too late for that now, isn't it?

837
00:57:11,544 --> 00:57:15,714
Look, why don't you persuade your
husband to throw a large shindig...

838
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,635
so he can introduce his bride to Rio
society say sometime next week?

839
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,678
Why?

840
00:57:20,886 --> 00:57:22,513
Consider me invited.

841
00:57:22,638 --> 00:57:24,807
I'll try to find out about that
wine cellar business.

842
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:31,355
I don't think my husband
is interested in entertaining just yet.

843
00:57:32,314 --> 00:57:34,108
The honeymoon isn't over, eh?

844
00:57:35,901 --> 00:57:39,530
Don't underestimate your charms,
Mrs. Sebastian, you can handle it.

845
00:57:40,614 --> 00:57:44,034
It's not going to be so easy about you.
He thinks you're in love with me.

846
00:57:44,451 --> 00:57:49,039
Tell him if you invited me to the house
and saw how happily married you were...

847
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:53,252
the horrid passion I have for you
might be torn out of me.

848
00:57:54,503 --> 00:57:56,130
That sounds very logical.

849
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:58,215
Good, next week then.
And get the key.

850
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,760
I have to fly up to Bel Air.
But I'll be back in time.

851
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,348
All right, I'll be looking forward
to seeing you.

852
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:08,225
It's always a pleasure meeting you,
Madame.

853
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:46,305
I'm surprised Mr. Devlin
coming tonight.

854
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:49,016
I don't blame anyone for being
in love with you, darling.

855
00:58:50,392 --> 00:58:54,521
I just hope that nothing will happen
to give him any false impression.

856
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:56,232
I'll be with you in a minute.

857
00:59:06,116 --> 00:59:07,326
Darling.

858
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,874
It's not that I don't trust you, but
when you're in love at my age...

859
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:16,001
every man that looks at your woman
is a menace.

860
00:59:16,126 --> 00:59:18,003
Will you forgive me
for even talking aboutit?

861
00:59:18,837 --> 00:59:20,297
I'm very contrite.

862
01:00:16,604 --> 01:00:19,398
I think we might join the rest of the
party now.

863
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:22,026
I think all our guests are here.

864
01:00:29,992 --> 01:00:31,493
Where can I find Madame Sebastian?

865
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,204
-Try the door, sir.
-Thanks.

866
01:00:50,221 --> 01:00:51,680
-Hello, Dev.
-Good evening.

867
01:01:00,564 --> 01:01:03,859
-You haven't seen the house?
-No, it's quite a jolly little cottage.

868
01:01:03,984 --> 01:01:07,238
-Let me show you around the place.
-Later. His nibs is on the trail.

869
01:01:10,532 --> 01:01:12,618
-Devlin, glad to see you.
-Good night.

870
01:01:12,743 --> 01:01:14,286
It was kind of your bride
to invite me.

871
01:01:14,411 --> 01:01:16,497
We both invite you, Mr. Devlin.

872
01:01:16,622 --> 01:01:19,917
Will you see our guest is fed, my dear?
And amused...

873
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:21,335
Oh, excuse me.

874
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,713
Madame Esterich,
I'm so glad to see you.

875
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,553
-It's not going to be easy.
-Why?

876
01:01:30,678 --> 01:01:34,640
He's quite sensitive about you.
He's going to watch us like a hawk.

877
01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:36,767
Yes, he's rather jealous of anyone.

878
01:01:37,351 --> 01:01:39,061
Where did you get the key?
Off his chain?

879
01:01:39,186 --> 01:01:40,104
Yes.

880
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,525
Let's hope the liquor doesn't run out
and start him down the cellar for more.

881
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:48,362
-I hadn't thought about that.
-Quite a point.

882
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,993
Thank you.

883
01:01:54,285 --> 01:01:56,412
Mr. Devlin, how nice!
You remember me?

884
01:01:56,537 --> 01:01:57,454
Seora Ortiz.

885
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,832
How sweet, young men usually
have short memories.

886
01:01:59,957 --> 01:02:02,835
Here's something I adore:
champagne.

887
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:04,545
Oh, may I?

888
01:02:12,303 --> 01:02:13,804
-Joseph?
-Madame?

889
01:02:14,054 --> 01:02:17,016
Do you think you have enough champagne
for the rest of the evening?

890
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:19,560
I don't know, Madame.
I hope so.

891
01:02:36,076 --> 01:02:38,537
-Enjoying yourself, Mr. Devlin?
-Very much, thank you.

892
01:02:38,662 --> 01:02:41,457
There are so many things
I'd like to ask about the States.

893
01:02:41,582 --> 01:02:43,209
I haven't heard anything
for a long time.

894
01:02:43,334 --> 01:02:46,003
I'll be glad to tell you.
Will you excuse me, Seora Ortiz?

895
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:47,129
I don't mind, certainly!

896
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:04,104
-We'd better hurry.
-Lots of time.

897
01:03:04,188 --> 01:03:06,857
No, Joseph might have to ask
Alex for more wine.

898
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,653
He's running out faster
than he thought.

899
01:03:10,778 --> 01:03:12,154
I'm sorry to hear that.

900
01:03:13,364 --> 01:03:15,783
-Is he watching?
-Yes.

901
01:03:15,866 --> 01:03:18,536
You'd better go out into the garden
and wait around the back of the house.

902
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,371
I'll show you the wine cellar door.

903
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,842
-Nice party, isn't it?
-It's a wonderful party.

904
01:03:33,968 --> 01:03:35,386
I think you've done it wonderfully
well.

905
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:37,972
I'm very proud.
Mr. Devlin bothering you much?

906
01:03:38,097 --> 01:03:40,808
No, darling.
He's trying to drown his sorrows.

907
01:04:20,306 --> 01:04:23,392
Excuse me, think I'll ask the orchestra
to play some Brazilian music.

908
01:04:23,517 --> 01:04:25,144
They've played waltzes all evening.

909
01:04:25,227 --> 01:04:25,895
All right, dear.

910
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:48,500
-That's the door.
-Right.

911
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:55,007
I'll keep the garden door open
and I'll tell you if anything happens.

912
01:05:57,736 --> 01:05:58,946
What's happened?

913
01:06:01,448 --> 01:06:02,658
Look, Vintage sand.

914
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,788
We've got to leave things
as we found them.

915
01:06:07,913 --> 01:06:10,207
Help me find a bottle of wine
with the same label as these others.

916
01:06:10,374 --> 01:06:13,836
-It isn't really sand, is it?
-I think it's some kind of metal ore.

917
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:31,520
-This is a bit weird.
-I'm terrified.

918
01:06:31,645 --> 01:06:34,899
Just pretend you're a janitor.
Janitors are never terrified.

919
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,442
I have a feeling we're very slow.

920
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:38,485
We're on schedule.
Take it easy.

921
01:06:38,611 --> 01:06:40,029
I can hear someone coming.

922
01:06:40,613 --> 01:06:42,114
Oh, that'll be nice.

923
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:45,034
Think if he comes down with Joseph.

924
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:46,410
Unfortunate.

925
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:17,358
Someone is coming.

926
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,402
It's Alex.
He's seen us.

927
01:07:20,527 --> 01:07:22,321
Wait a minute.
I'm going to kiss you.

928
01:07:22,446 --> 01:07:24,406
-No, he'll only think....
-That's what I want him to think.

929
01:07:29,995 --> 01:07:32,498
You better stay upstairs,
they may need you.

930
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:33,415
Yes, sir.

931
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:41,757
Oh, Dev, Dev!

932
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,349
Push me away!

933
01:07:54,645 --> 01:07:57,022
I'm sorry to intrude
on this tender scene.

934
01:07:57,856 --> 01:07:59,733
I couldn't help what happened:
he's been drinking.

935
01:08:01,068 --> 01:08:02,903
So, he carried you down here.

936
01:08:02,987 --> 01:08:04,154
Please, Alex!

937
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:07,825
-You love him.
-No, of course not. Please go.

938
01:08:08,158 --> 01:08:11,203
For what it's worth, as an apology,
your wife is telling the truth.

939
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:13,622
I knew her before you,
I loved here before you...

940
01:08:13,664 --> 01:08:15,332
but I wasn't as lucky as you.

941
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:16,959
Sorry, Alicia.

942
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:18,794
-Please, go.
-Goodnight.

943
01:08:24,383 --> 01:08:26,051
Alex, don't be foolish.
I came down here...

944
01:08:26,218 --> 01:08:29,430
because he threatened to make a scene
unless I'd see him alone.

945
01:08:29,555 --> 01:08:30,764
He kissed you.

946
01:08:31,765 --> 01:08:33,100
I couldn't stop him.

947
01:08:33,183 --> 01:08:37,104
We'll talk about it later.
Your guests are upstairs.

948
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,232
Will you please go to them?

949
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,242
Mr. Devlin, are you going so soon?

950
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,912
Yes, I'm afraid I have to be up
early in the morning.

951
01:08:53,078 --> 01:08:54,580
Thank you and goodnight.

952
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:00,419
-Joseph?
-Yes, sir.

953
01:09:00,544 --> 01:09:02,838
-We can go down for the wine now.
-Yes, sir.

954
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:29,615
Joseph, I don't think we need to
give them any more champagne.

955
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:32,368
-We still have some upstairs.
-Yes, sir.

956
01:09:34,161 --> 01:09:36,705
-There's whisky and the wine.
-Yes, sir.

957
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,624
Well, I think we'll give them that.

958
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:51,720
I'm sorry about what happened, Alex.

959
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:55,891
My dear, I shall never forgive myself
for behaving like a schoolboy.

960
01:09:57,977 --> 01:09:59,979
-Then you believe me?
-Of course.

961
01:10:00,104 --> 01:10:01,981
-It isn't worth mentioning again.
-Thank you.

962
01:10:03,107 --> 01:10:04,525
-Are you coming up?
-Not for a little while.

963
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,944
Dr. Anderson's waiting for me
in the study.

964
01:10:07,194 --> 01:10:08,612
Sleep well.

965
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,198
It was a very successful party.

966
01:10:12,366 --> 01:10:13,993
-Goodnight, then.
-Goodnight.

967
01:10:14,118 --> 01:10:15,911
Thanks for being so nice.

968
01:13:33,901 --> 01:13:34,985
Mother!

969
01:13:37,655 --> 01:13:38,656
Mother!

970
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,958
Why are you up so early?

971
01:13:50,584 --> 01:13:52,002
I need your help.

972
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:54,630
Something is wrong?

973
01:13:56,215 --> 01:13:59,051
A great deal, Alicia.

974
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:04,807
I have expected it.

975
01:14:04,932 --> 01:14:07,184
I knew, I knew!

976
01:14:07,518 --> 01:14:10,271
What is it?
Mr. Devlin?

977
01:14:11,355 --> 01:14:12,606
No.

978
01:14:17,778 --> 01:14:20,030
I'm married to an American agent.

979
01:14:48,058 --> 01:14:51,770
Yes, it's easy to see now.

980
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,398
I knew but I didn't see.

981
01:14:55,065 --> 01:14:56,859
They picked her because of her father.

982
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,821
I must have been insane, mad.
Behaved like an idiot.

983
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:02,781
To believe in her
with her clinging kisses!

984
01:15:02,907 --> 01:15:05,034
Stop wallowing in your foul memories.

985
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:06,577
Well, what do I do?

986
01:15:07,411 --> 01:15:09,205
There's nothing to do.
I'm done, finished.

987
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:14,752
-They'll find out.
-They won't find out.

988
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,337
They'll find out what I'm married to.

989
01:15:16,462 --> 01:15:19,423
Look what they did to Emil Hupka.
Emil, who did nothing.

990
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,134
And I betrayed them.
I bungled and there's no excuse.

991
01:15:24,261 --> 01:15:27,056
I'd do the same myself:
kill the fool that betrayed them.

992
01:15:27,181 --> 01:15:30,267
-There's no need for them to find out.
-Mathis is very sharp.

993
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,437
He dislikes you, but his criticism
of your talents wouldn't

994
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:36,649
go that far to imagine that you're
married to an American agent.

995
01:15:37,149 --> 01:15:41,403
We are protected by the enormity
of your stupidity for a time.

996
01:15:41,528 --> 01:15:44,573
-Listen, I'll take care of her myself.
-No, not in that way.

997
01:15:44,698 --> 01:15:47,910
I stood looking at her while she was
asleep and I could have...

998
01:15:48,035 --> 01:15:49,453
Quiet, Alex!

999
01:15:52,623 --> 01:15:55,376
You're almost as impetuous
as before your wedding.

1000
01:15:55,543 --> 01:15:59,505
You barred me from that episode.
Let me arrange this one.

1001
01:16:00,172 --> 01:16:03,300
Listen to me.
No-one must know what she is.

1002
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:06,804
There must be no suspicion
of her, of you, of me.

1003
01:16:07,888 --> 01:16:10,516
She must be allowed to move
about freely.

1004
01:16:10,808 --> 01:16:12,601
But she will be on a leash.

1005
01:16:13,018 --> 01:16:15,854
She will learn nothing further
to inform.

1006
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,484
She must go,
but it must happen slowly.

1007
01:16:20,734 --> 01:16:26,031
If she could become ill,
and remain ill for a time, until...

1008
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,209
Drink your coffee, darling,
it's getting cold.

1009
01:16:37,877 --> 01:16:39,712
Are you going out this afternoon,
Alex?

1010
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:42,840
No, my dear, I've some letters to write.
What are you going to do?

1011
01:16:43,716 --> 01:16:45,384
Oh, I just have a little shopping.

1012
01:16:46,176 --> 01:16:48,429
I'd like to go to the imperial.
Maybe I'll go to Cosmo's...

1013
01:16:48,554 --> 01:16:50,639
and see if they've any new books
in from New York.

1014
01:16:50,764 --> 01:16:53,601
If you're going down there,
will you go into Sisacruz for me...

1015
01:16:53,726 --> 01:16:55,227
and see if my cigars have arrived?

1016
01:16:55,352 --> 01:16:56,687
Should be about a thousand.

1017
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:58,856
If they've, ask them to keep them
in the humidor for me.

1018
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,445
Anything wrong?

1019
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:07,531
No, the light bothers me.

1020
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:09,825
I have a bit of a headache,
would you mind...

1021
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,952
-No, yes, I think we can fix that.
-Thank you.

1022
01:17:13,245 --> 01:17:15,873
Some people get too much sun down
here, you must be careful.

1023
01:17:17,917 --> 01:17:21,253
I think you can be very proud
of yourself.

1024
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:25,174
That sand that Devlin brought in
shows uranium ore.

1025
01:17:25,299 --> 01:17:27,218
So now we know
what we're driving at.

1026
01:17:27,635 --> 01:17:31,513
Your job from now on will be to help us
find out where that sand comes from.

1027
01:17:31,805 --> 01:17:35,142
The location of the uranium deposit
is of vast importance and...

1028
01:17:35,309 --> 01:17:36,977
we're putting quite a few people on it.

1029
01:17:37,102 --> 01:17:39,521
But I think you'll be of great help.

1030
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:40,564
All right.

1031
01:17:40,648 --> 01:17:43,567
But that isn't the main reason
why I asked you to come up here.

1032
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,195
-No?
-No, I wanted to tell you...

1033
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,948
that I'm going to change
your contact in about a week.

1034
01:17:49,406 --> 01:17:51,867
Mr. Devlin's been transferred to Spain.

1035
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,286
To Spain?

1036
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:58,624
-Does Mr. Devlin know that?
-Oh yes, he asked for the transfer.

1037
01:17:58,749 --> 01:17:59,625
Why?

1038
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,752
I guess he thought
he was going to stale here.

1039
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:04,296
Oh, he wants to leave Rio.

1040
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:08,300
He thought he'd find Spain
more interesting.

1041
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:11,804
Yes, I imagine it would be.
There really isn't very much...

1042
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:15,182
for a brainy fellow like Mr. Devlin
to do in Rio any more.

1043
01:18:15,307 --> 01:18:17,726
Well, of course, it is more or less
routine now.

1044
01:18:19,353 --> 01:18:22,940
In the meantime I'm to report
to Mr. Devlin as usual.

1045
01:18:23,107 --> 01:18:25,859
Yes, he'll be here
until the new man arrives.

1046
01:18:26,485 --> 01:18:30,197
Thank you, Captain Prescott,
I'll keep my ears wide open.

1047
01:18:30,322 --> 01:18:31,448
-Good bye.
-Good bye.

1048
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:35,411
Oh, and... go easy on that sun, eh?

1049
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:49,133
Darling, what is it?

1050
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,176
I don't know.

1051
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:55,431
-Are you in pain?
-Yes, I'm so dizzy.

1052
01:18:55,848 --> 01:18:56,640
What happened to her?

1053
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:58,684
We were walking and
she was stricken suddenly.

1054
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,853
I'll be all right.
Let's go inside.

1055
01:19:22,374 --> 01:19:24,084
I'm sorry I couldn't make it on time.

1056
01:19:24,168 --> 01:19:26,754
Well, it gets a bit lonely
squatting on a bench all day.

1057
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:29,924
Yes, Rio can be a very dull town.

1058
01:19:30,007 --> 01:19:31,550
What's new?

1059
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:34,803
Nothing.
What's new of you?

1060
01:19:35,054 --> 01:19:35,888
Nothing.

1061
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:39,767
Any domestic troubles
about the other night?

1062
01:19:41,852 --> 01:19:42,811
No.

1063
01:19:42,937 --> 01:19:44,772
Any footprints in that sand yet?

1064
01:19:45,856 --> 01:19:47,566
No, nothing yet.

1065
01:19:48,525 --> 01:19:50,194
Just a social visit, huh?

1066
01:19:51,278 --> 01:19:53,113
A little fresh air helps.

1067
01:19:53,948 --> 01:19:55,532
You don't look so hot.

1068
01:19:57,618 --> 01:19:59,787
-Well
-Sick?

1069
01:20:01,121 --> 01:20:03,082
No.
Hangover.

1070
01:20:06,418 --> 01:20:08,712
That's news.
Back to the bottle again, huh?

1071
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:12,341
Sort of lightens my chores.

1072
01:20:12,466 --> 01:20:15,511
-Big party?
-Just the family circle.

1073
01:20:15,636 --> 01:20:17,555
Sounds quite jolly.

1074
01:20:17,972 --> 01:20:19,682
it helps life in a dull town.

1075
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:22,518
You ought to take it easy
on that liquor.

1076
01:20:24,728 --> 01:20:29,066
Don't you find Rio a little hard
to take, too?

1077
01:20:30,484 --> 01:20:31,944
Not a bad town.

1078
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,240
You look all mashed up:
must have been quite an evening.

1079
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:39,410
Yes, it was.

1080
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:42,162
Well, if you want to play it that way,
go on have fun.

1081
01:20:42,663 --> 01:20:44,164
No reason why you shouldn't.

1082
01:20:44,498 --> 01:20:47,251
That's right, Dev.
Here's something that belongs to you.

1083
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:48,878
I should have given it to you sooner.

1084
01:20:49,044 --> 01:20:53,257
-What is it?
-The scarf you lent me once in Miami.

1085
01:20:58,929 --> 01:21:00,264
Cleaning house, huh?

1086
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,141
Yeah...

1087
01:21:05,436 --> 01:21:06,979
Well, goodbye, Dev.

1088
01:21:08,022 --> 01:21:09,815
What do you mean, goodbye?

1089
01:21:11,442 --> 01:21:13,068
Nothing, just goodbye.

1090
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,530
Fresh air isn't as good
for a hangover as I thought.

1091
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:18,198
Sit down, you're still tight.

1092
01:21:18,824 --> 01:21:19,909
I don't want to.

1093
01:21:21,994 --> 01:21:23,621
Where are you going?

1094
01:21:24,205 --> 01:21:26,457
Back home.

1095
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,589
You're not taking care
of yourself, Alicia.

1096
01:21:33,714 --> 01:21:35,132
Oh, I feel much better.

1097
01:21:35,841 --> 01:21:37,593
You look like something awful.

1098
01:21:39,845 --> 01:21:41,513
Circles under the eyes...

1099
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:46,560
My dear child, you must have
a doctor find out...

1100
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:47,978
what is the matter with you.

1101
01:21:49,146 --> 01:21:51,106
I never go near doctors.

1102
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:54,026
They always want
to cart you off to a hospital.

1103
01:21:54,526 --> 01:21:56,779
Maybe you belong in a hospital.

1104
01:21:58,572 --> 01:22:02,159
Tell me when did you first feel sick?

1105
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:08,332
I don't remember,
maybe the party, I think.

1106
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:09,833
I still think a sea trip...

1107
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:13,045
would be much better for you darling
nor doctors or hospitals.

1108
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,506
A little cruise somewhere.
Maybe Spain?

1109
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:18,008
Put the roses back in your cheeks,
my sweet.

1110
01:22:18,175 --> 01:22:20,636
I don't think so.
I don't care much for boats.

1111
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:22,263
We could go together, my dear.

1112
01:22:22,388 --> 01:22:25,349
If you could bear to leave Alex
behind for a few weeks.

1113
01:22:25,766 --> 01:22:28,310
I think I prefer Alex to
a case of seasickness.

1114
01:22:30,938 --> 01:22:32,439
I always get seasick.

1115
01:22:33,566 --> 01:22:36,277
Then you might like the mountains.

1116
01:22:37,778 --> 01:22:40,239
The air's fresh and pure and...

1117
01:22:40,364 --> 01:22:43,200
-I'm gong next week.
-Oh, you're leaving?

1118
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:45,494
I'm sorry, I'll miss you.

1119
01:22:46,078 --> 01:22:49,206
Yes, I'm delaying my work
too long.

1120
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:52,960
If you'll come with me, the mountains
won't make you seasick.

1121
01:22:53,961 --> 01:22:58,173
And the Aimress mountains
are beautiful, covered with flowers...

1122
01:22:58,299 --> 01:23:01,844
What Alicia needs is rest,
not mountain climbing.

1123
01:23:02,428 --> 01:23:04,638
I've heard about the Aimress.

1124
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:06,640
Did you? Really?

1125
01:23:08,851 --> 01:23:12,104
Yes, about
the beautiful little native towns.

1126
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:14,189
Are you going to Leopoldina?

1127
01:23:14,398 --> 01:23:18,319
-No, no, I'm going to Santa Ma...
-Care for some more brandy, Otto?

1128
01:23:18,444 --> 01:23:20,321
No, thanks.

1129
01:23:20,654 --> 01:23:24,617
I never drink more than one brandy
and even this is sometimes too much.

1130
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,327
I'll just finish my coffee.

1131
01:23:26,452 --> 01:23:28,287
-No, that is not your...
-That's Alicia's...

1132
01:23:29,413 --> 01:23:31,373
I'm sorry,

1133
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:35,336
Yeah, perhaps Alex is right,
my dear child.

1134
01:23:35,502 --> 01:23:38,088
When you are young,
rest is the best doctor.

1135
01:23:39,131 --> 01:23:42,927
if you lie still for a few days...

1136
01:23:43,052 --> 01:23:46,680
reading, relaxing,
forgetting all your troubles...

1137
01:23:46,805 --> 01:23:49,683
it might be as well
as a medicinal ocean air.

1138
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,394
And when I come back
you will be all well...

1139
01:23:52,811 --> 01:23:55,022
making us all very happy once
more.

1140
01:24:00,444 --> 01:24:03,447
Excuse me,
I want to go to bed, I feel...

1141
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:05,241
Pain again, darling?

1142
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:06,784
Sorry to complain again.

1143
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:10,496
Shall I take you up to your room?

1144
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:15,167
May I help you, my dear?
Some hot water, maybe?

1145
01:24:18,546 --> 01:24:21,465
No, no, please don't bother.

1146
01:24:22,633 --> 01:24:24,051
I'll be all right.

1147
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:27,346
If she's no better in the morning,
I insist you call a doctor.

1148
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,057
I don't like the way she looks.

1149
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:31,600
I'm worried about her.

1150
01:25:01,505 --> 01:25:03,173
Alicia!
Joseph!

1151
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:04,842
Joseph!
Help me with her, will you?

1152
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:07,177
-You must take her up to bed.
-Yes, up to her room.

1153
01:25:07,678 --> 01:25:09,138
Come on, my dear.

1154
01:25:16,562 --> 01:25:18,439
I told you she was sick.

1155
01:25:18,564 --> 01:25:21,567
Now, come on, don't excite yourself.
Be quiet.

1156
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:26,280
No, no, go away!
No! No!

1157
01:25:36,123 --> 01:25:38,500
The attack's come so suddenly!
I'm sure is not serious.

1158
01:25:41,795 --> 01:25:45,466
We must get a doctor.
The poor child is suffering so much.

1159
01:25:45,591 --> 01:25:48,052
I'll call the hospital.
I'll get Doctor Lisard.

1160
01:25:48,177 --> 01:25:51,639
Don't worry, dear Otto.
We'll get a doctor, a good one.

1161
01:25:51,764 --> 01:25:53,265
We'll take the best care of her.

1162
01:25:56,393 --> 01:25:58,729
Joseph, disconnect the telephone.

1163
01:25:58,854 --> 01:26:01,190
Madame must have absolute quiet.

1164
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,108
Take it out of the room, Joseph.

1165
01:26:29,843 --> 01:26:31,762
Five days, eh?

1166
01:26:31,845 --> 01:26:33,764
Say, that must be quite
a binge she's on.

1167
01:26:33,847 --> 01:26:35,140
I don't think so.

1168
01:26:35,266 --> 01:26:38,519
You said she was drinking last week,
drunk when you saw her.

1169
01:26:38,644 --> 01:26:41,772
-But I've had time to think it over.
-Think what over.

1170
01:26:41,897 --> 01:26:44,567
That drinking of hers.
I don't believe it.

1171
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:46,443
Why should she lie to you about that?

1172
01:26:46,694 --> 01:26:47,820
I don't know.

1173
01:26:47,945 --> 01:26:50,030
But she wasn't drunk,
she was sick.

1174
01:26:50,155 --> 01:26:51,949
Maybe that's why
she hasn't shown up.

1175
01:26:52,408 --> 01:26:54,076
She looked like the ragged end
of nowhere.

1176
01:26:54,201 --> 01:26:57,329
-It still sounds like a hangover to me.
-Well, I'm going to pay her a call.

1177
01:26:57,454 --> 01:26:59,915
Wait a minute!
I don't want you to mess things up.

1178
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,042
We hope to close this case down
in a few days.

1179
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:03,377
I won't mess anything up.

1180
01:27:03,502 --> 01:27:06,422
Just a social call.
I'm a friend of the family.

1181
01:27:06,547 --> 01:27:09,633
All right, go ahead if you want to.
But don't take any chances.

1182
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:12,177
And call me up when you get back!

1183
01:27:12,303 --> 01:27:13,262
I'll do that!

1184
01:27:38,913 --> 01:27:39,872
Good evening, sir.

1185
01:27:39,997 --> 01:27:42,166
Good evening.
Family home tonight?

1186
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:43,250
Yes, sir.

1187
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:46,086
Would you mind telling
Mr. Sebastian that Mr. Devlin is here?

1188
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:50,966
-What is it, Joseph?
-I'm sorry, sir, but...

1189
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,220
since Mr. Sebastian asked me
not to disturb him...

1190
01:27:54,386 --> 01:27:55,262
Asleep?

1191
01:27:55,387 --> 01:27:58,182
No sir, he's in the study
with some business associates.

1192
01:27:58,307 --> 01:28:00,601
-How long will he be tied up?
-I don't know, sir.

1193
01:28:00,893 --> 01:28:03,646
-Is Mrs. Sebastian home?
-Yes, sir.

1194
01:28:03,771 --> 01:28:06,232
-Would you mind telling her?
-I'm afraid I can't, sir.

1195
01:28:06,357 --> 01:28:07,149
Why not?

1196
01:28:07,274 --> 01:28:09,652
Mrs. Sebastian is very ill
and confined to her bed.

1197
01:28:12,071 --> 01:28:13,280
I'm sorry to hear that.

1198
01:28:13,405 --> 01:28:15,241
-How long has she been ill?
-A week.

1199
01:28:15,366 --> 01:28:17,326
-Has she had a doctor?
-I think so, sir.

1200
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:20,204
We're all very concerned
about her.

1201
01:28:20,663 --> 01:28:23,374
If you'll wait here, Mr. Devlin,
I'll tell Mr. Sebastian.

1202
01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:24,959
Right.

1203
01:28:32,174 --> 01:28:34,176
-Excuse me, sir?
-What is it, Joseph?

1204
01:28:34,301 --> 01:28:36,178
Mr. Devlin to see you, sir.

1205
01:28:38,472 --> 01:28:40,140
Tell him I'll be with him
in a minute, will you?

1206
01:28:40,307 --> 01:28:41,392
Yes, sir.

1207
01:28:43,811 --> 01:28:46,355
Go on, professor.
This sounds serious to me.

1208
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,773
To me, also.

1209
01:28:47,898 --> 01:28:50,192
-What happened Monday?
-Same thing.

1210
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,446
When I left the bank
a man was following me.

1211
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:57,199
This morning when I went
to the ticket office...

1212
01:28:57,324 --> 01:29:00,202
the same man came inside
and stood beside me.

1213
01:30:03,807 --> 01:30:05,309
Alicia!

1214
01:30:05,517 --> 01:30:06,685
Alicia!

1215
01:30:10,814 --> 01:30:11,982
Dev!

1216
01:30:13,692 --> 01:30:15,444
Alicia, what's wrong with you?

1217
01:30:15,527 --> 01:30:17,947
I'm so glad you came.

1218
01:30:20,157 --> 01:30:23,118
I had to.
I couldn't stand any more.

1219
01:30:23,244 --> 01:30:24,954
Waiting and worrying about you.

1220
01:30:26,539 --> 01:30:28,415
It wasn't a hangover you had that day.

1221
01:30:29,124 --> 01:30:31,835
You were sick then.
What is it?

1222
01:30:32,378 --> 01:30:34,171
Yes, I was sick then.

1223
01:30:35,589 --> 01:30:37,132
What's wrong with you, Alicia?

1224
01:30:38,592 --> 01:30:41,178
-Oh, Dev.
-What is it dear? What's wrong?

1225
01:30:42,429 --> 01:30:47,726
They're poisoning me.
I couldn't get away from them.

1226
01:30:48,018 --> 01:30:49,853
I tried, but it was too weak.

1227
01:30:50,062 --> 01:30:51,397
How long?

1228
01:30:53,482 --> 01:30:54,984
Since the party.

1229
01:30:55,901 --> 01:30:58,696
Alex and his mother found out.

1230
01:31:01,907 --> 01:31:03,909
You want to try to sit up.

1231
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:07,037
Sit up.
I've got to get you out of here.

1232
01:31:07,162 --> 01:31:08,622
I thought you had gone.

1233
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:12,918
No, I had to see you once
to speak my piece.

1234
01:31:13,627 --> 01:31:15,963
I was getting out because I love you.

1235
01:31:16,046 --> 01:31:18,549
I couldn't bear seeing you and him
together.

1236
01:31:25,681 --> 01:31:28,684
Oh, you love me!
Why didn't you tell me before?

1237
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:33,772
I know, but I couldn't see straight
or think straight.

1238
01:31:35,441 --> 01:31:41,196
I was a fat-headed guy full of pain.
It tore me up not having you.

1239
01:31:44,408 --> 01:31:48,287
Oh, you love me!
You love me!

1240
01:31:48,579 --> 01:31:51,415
Long ago.
All the time since the beginning.

1241
01:31:55,586 --> 01:31:57,046
Here, put on your robe.

1242
01:31:59,048 --> 01:32:00,758
-Come on.
-Yes.

1243
01:32:01,717 --> 01:32:02,718
Try to stand up.

1244
01:32:06,096 --> 01:32:10,517
Dev, I'm afraid, I can't make it
because they gave me pills to sleep.

1245
01:32:12,019 --> 01:32:14,480
Keep away.
Keep talking.

1246
01:32:16,232 --> 01:32:18,525
-Have you got a coat?
-In the closet.

1247
01:32:19,276 --> 01:32:22,196
They didn't want the others
to know about me.

1248
01:32:29,495 --> 01:32:30,412
Keep talking.

1249
01:32:34,959 --> 01:32:36,210
Come on.
What happened?

1250
01:32:38,087 --> 01:32:41,131
-Alex found out.
-And the others haven't?

1251
01:32:41,674 --> 01:32:45,970
They'd kill him if they knew.
They killed Emil.

1252
01:32:47,263 --> 01:32:48,806
Are you in pain?

1253
01:32:48,889 --> 01:32:51,058
I don't know, the pills...

1254
01:32:51,225 --> 01:32:52,643
Give me your feet...

1255
01:32:54,895 --> 01:32:57,106
Say it again.
It keeps me awake.

1256
01:32:57,439 --> 01:32:59,066
I love you.

1257
01:33:00,568 --> 01:33:02,403
Stand up!
Stand up!

1258
01:33:02,987 --> 01:33:05,114
Come on, wake up!
Talk!

1259
01:33:06,532 --> 01:33:09,410
-Dr. Anderson...
-Go on, go on.

1260
01:33:09,535 --> 01:33:11,036
Walk!
Talk!

1261
01:33:11,161 --> 01:33:15,541
The sand comes from the Aimress
mountains.

1262
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:16,876
We'll find it.

1263
01:33:17,001 --> 01:33:20,546
From a town, Santa Ma...
something.

1264
01:33:20,671 --> 01:33:22,381
Good girl.
We'll take care of it later.

1265
01:33:22,506 --> 01:33:24,174
-Come on, keep walking!
-I'm afraid, Dev.

1266
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,386
They're all in the house.
We can't make it.

1267
01:33:35,644 --> 01:33:37,146
Don't ever leave me.

1268
01:33:37,229 --> 01:33:38,731
You'll never get rid of me again.

1269
01:33:40,733 --> 01:33:42,443
I'll never try to.

1270
01:33:42,985 --> 01:33:44,403
Brace up.
Here he comes.

1271
01:33:50,701 --> 01:33:53,078
What are you doing, Alicia?
What is this, Mr. Devlin?

1272
01:33:53,204 --> 01:33:55,539
I'm taking her to the hospital
to get the poison out of her.

1273
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:57,333
Poison?

1274
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,418
Would you like your friends
downstairs to know?

1275
01:34:00,002 --> 01:34:01,670
I'm taking her back to her room.

1276
01:34:01,795 --> 01:34:03,839
No, I'll raise quite a rumpus
if you try.

1277
01:34:03,964 --> 01:34:04,882
Alex!

1278
01:34:06,258 --> 01:34:08,344
-He knows?
-Yes.

1279
01:34:08,469 --> 01:34:09,470
What is happening, Alex?

1280
01:34:11,889 --> 01:34:12,723
Alicia!

1281
01:34:13,098 --> 01:34:14,808
-She's worse?
-Yes.

1282
01:34:14,975 --> 01:34:16,936
All right, dear, we're going.

1283
01:34:18,145 --> 01:34:20,856
You haven't forgotten what
they did to Emil, have you Sebastian?

1284
01:34:24,985 --> 01:34:26,278
Help him, Alex.

1285
01:34:27,238 --> 01:34:29,156
I'm glad you have a head on you,
Madame.

1286
01:34:29,281 --> 01:34:31,033
I'm not afraid to die.

1287
01:34:32,326 --> 01:34:34,161
You've got your chance,
here and now.

1288
01:34:34,286 --> 01:34:35,746
Tell them who she is.

1289
01:34:36,997 --> 01:34:38,374
Need any help, Alex?

1290
01:34:39,416 --> 01:34:42,044
-No, we can handle her.
-Where are you taking her?

1291
01:34:44,463 --> 01:34:46,173
You answer that one, Sebastian.

1292
01:34:46,507 --> 01:34:47,841
To the hospital.

1293
01:34:47,967 --> 01:34:50,094
Alex, talk to them, quick!

1294
01:34:55,099 --> 01:34:57,017
I'm glad she's going.

1295
01:34:57,268 --> 01:34:59,061
You should not have waited so long,
Alex.

1296
01:35:01,689 --> 01:35:03,774
What am I going to do, start shooting?

1297
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:07,778
Hold on, darling, you've only got
about twenty yards to go.

1298
01:35:08,028 --> 01:35:09,446
What happened, Alex?

1299
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,828
Oh, she collapsed.

1300
01:35:16,662 --> 01:35:20,165
Mr. Devlin heard her scream
when he was waiting for me.

1301
01:35:20,249 --> 01:35:21,166
Come on, Alicia.

1302
01:35:21,292 --> 01:35:23,878
Yes, I telephoned the hospital
as soon as I saw how she was.

1303
01:35:24,336 --> 01:35:25,921
-You have a car, Mr. Devlin?
-In front.

1304
01:35:26,046 --> 01:35:26,964
Your hat, Alex.

1305
01:35:27,506 --> 01:35:29,341
You're going with them, Anna?

1306
01:35:29,675 --> 01:35:32,553
No, Alex will call me up.
I'll wait here.

1307
01:35:32,678 --> 01:35:34,847
The sooner the doctor sees her...

1308
01:35:35,264 --> 01:35:36,640
Poor child!

1309
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:41,854
-How do you feel?
-Bit dizzy.

1310
01:35:41,979 --> 01:35:44,982
-Take some deep breaths.
-Hurry, hurry.

1311
01:35:55,075 --> 01:35:57,870
-Just a minute, I must sit with her.
-No room, Sebastian.

1312
01:35:57,995 --> 01:36:00,706
-You must take me, they're watching!
-That's your headache.

1313
01:36:00,873 --> 01:36:03,626
Please take me!
Please, please!

1314
01:36:05,169 --> 01:36:07,922
There is no telephone in her room
to call the hospital.

1315
01:36:09,465 --> 01:36:14,220
Alex, will you come in, please?
I wish to talk to you.
