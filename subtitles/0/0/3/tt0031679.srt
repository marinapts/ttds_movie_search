1
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,746
"Senator Samuel Foley dead."

2
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,645
Died here at Saint Vincent's.

3
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,417
"At the bedside was political
sidekick Senator Joseph Paine."

4
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:34,524
Long distance?

5
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:38,163
Joseph Paine speaking. I want
the governor's residence, Jackson City.

6
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,923
Oh, Joe!

7
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,058
Oh, no!

8
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,067
Couldn't have happened
at a worse time.

9
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,706
Call Jim Taylor. Tell him
I'm flying home tonight.

10
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,631
Right away.

11
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:51,936
What is it?

12
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,045
-Sam Foley's dead.
-Great saints!

13
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,077
Of all times...

14
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,545
...Foley had to go and die on us.

15
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,183
Who are you calling?

16
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,374
Taylor, my dear.

17
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,088
What's up, Happy?

18
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,880
Sam Foley died tonight.

19
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,019
That's too bad.

20
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,751
Well, don't get excited.
Is Paine coming?

21
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,452
Yes, Jim.

22
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,265
Yes, Jim.

23
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,864
He'd drop dead
if you ever said no.

24
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,568
My dear, this is no time for jokes.

25
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,398
I've got to appoint a new senator.

26
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,175
The governor will see all committees.

27
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,733
The governor will see all committees.

28
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,241
Tell him I won't wait any longer.

29
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,809
Probably got Taylor in there,
telling him what to do.

30
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,644
Tell them to wait.
I'll see them immediately.

31
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,780
I can't put those howling citizens
off any longer.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,016
They'll want something to say about
who takes Foley's place.

33
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,591
Ten to one they've got a man.

34
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,818
Relax, Happy.

35
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,291
Stop having kittens.

36
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,965
Go and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine...

37
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,431
...I'll give them one more minute
to make up their minds.

38
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,160
You go tell Jim Taylor.

39
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,531
I will tell him.

40
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,765
It's high time I told Jim Taylor
a thing or two.

41
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,613
If you and Joe gab any longer
about this appointment...

42
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,041
...I'll see those committees.

43
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,182
You'll see them when we're finished.

44
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,079
But hurry, will you?

45
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,917
That's telling him, Happy, old boy.

46
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,249
Jim...

47
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,259
...with this Willet Creek Dam
coming up...

48
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,728
...the man who takes Foley's place...

49
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,869
...can't ask any questions
or talk out of turn.

50
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,731
We must be absolutely sure of him.

51
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,463
That's why I say Horace Miller.

52
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,403
He'll take orders all right.

53
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,873
Suppose we don't try to go through
with this dam.

54
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,080
Suppose we postpone it
until next session of Congress.

55
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,271
Or drop it altogether.

56
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,052
That'd be a crime, Joe.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,984
After all the work we put in on it?

58
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,755
Burying it in this deficiency bill...

59
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,688
...as nicely as you please.

60
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,488
Having it approved.
It's rolling along.

61
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,562
Like taking candy from a baby.

62
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,223
Is it worth the risk of a scandal,
with a new man in the Senate?

63
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,801
Worth the risk?

64
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,063
What's the matter with you?

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,136
Where you're concerned,
I wouldn't take the slightest risk...

66
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,471
...especially with your great reputation
in the Senate.

67
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,038
Here, look.

68
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:12,009
Look at the campaign I started for you
in all my papers.

69
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,646
A little obscure, isn't it?

70
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,288
I don't know. Maybe.

71
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,121
But after all, you're the logical man
from the West...

72
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,090
...for the national ticket.

73
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,526
At the convention, anything can happen.

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,792
If what you say is possible...

75
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,368
...why not do as I say
and drop things like this dam?

76
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,596
We can't do it, Joe.

77
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,568
We've been quietly buying all the land
around that dam...

78
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,211
...and holding it in dummy names.

79
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,008
If we drop it now,
it'll bring about an investigation.

80
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,447
It'll show that we're going to sell it
to the state...

81
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,815
...under phony names.

82
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,888
The smartest thing for us to do...

83
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,025
...is to push this dam through...

84
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,819
...and get it over with.

85
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,127
All right, appoint Miller.

86
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,355
If you're sure he'll take orders.

87
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,624
Don't worry.
He'll take orders.

88
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,823
Come on.

89
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,068
Just a minute.
Just one more minute!

90
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,467
We've got your man.

91
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,302
Horace Miller.

92
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,710
A born stooge!

93
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,209
Horace will perform like a trained seal.

94
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,881
What did I tell you?

95
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,277
If I throw a party man like Miller--

96
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,884
For reasons I can't go into,
it's got to be him.

97
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,749
Do you understand?
Now make out your ticket.

98
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:24,980
Come on.

99
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,557
But I've got to see those
angry committees first.

100
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,852
Work for harmony.

101
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:29,892
Harmony!

102
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,429
In considering candidates who might have
the high qualifications...

103
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,191
...of U.S. senator...

104
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,234
...one name shone out like a beacon...

105
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,938
...the Honorable Horace Miller.

106
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,469
A party man.
He's Taylor's stooge!

107
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,541
Please!

108
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,509
New Citizens Committee
won't stand for this!

109
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,778
So they named their own candidate, eh?

110
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:52,973
Who?

111
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,720
-You won't like him.
-Come on, who?

112
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,680
Henry Hill.

113
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,187
That crackpot?

114
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,916
You should've killed that so fast--

115
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,253
I couldn't.

116
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,396
-Those men were--
-Never mind.

117
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,791
You forget about them.

118
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,228
That bunch is out for blood.
If l--

119
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,560
I said forget about them.

120
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,431
Horace Miller goes to the Senate,
and that settles it.

121
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,467
I won't send Horace Miller.

122
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,269
-You won't?
-No, I won't.

123
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,037
I won't let you callously
wreck my whole political future.

124
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,273
Your political future?

125
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,418
I bought it for you as a present.

126
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,281
I can grab it back so fast
it'll make your head swim.

127
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,287
You've got a nerve to sit and worry
about your future...

128
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,221
...when we're in a spot like this.

129
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,917
The man is Miller.

130
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,561
Hello, Dad.

131
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,898
What's the matter?
Is it getting you down?

132
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,197
Is what getting me down?

133
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,034
You're in a deuce of a pickle.

134
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,142
Looks like Henry Hill or else.

135
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,278
It's Horace Miller or else.

136
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,309
Peter!

137
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:59,076
I wouldn't appoint a twerp like Miller,
Taylor or no Taylor.

138
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,412
May I ask
what Taylor has to do with this?

139
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,555
He's still running the show, ain't he?

140
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,487
I won't have conversation of this sort
carried on at dinner.

141
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,092
Why don't you listen to them
for a change?

142
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,755
No doubt they can make
this appointment for me with ease.

143
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,830
That's easy.
Jefferson Smith.

144
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,831
I beg your pardon?

145
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,401
He's the only senator to have.

146
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,231
He ought to be President.

147
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,873
I like Jeff Smith.

148
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,708
You too?
Now everybody's been heard from.

149
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,575
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know
him from a hole in the ground.

150
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,751
-Gosh, head of the Boy Rangers!
-Oh, a boy?

151
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,444
No, Dad. Jeff's a man.
Jeff Smith.

152
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,920
Biggest expert we got in wild game--

153
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,093
Right now he's the greatest hero
we ever had.

154
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,694
It's all over the headlines.

155
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,990
Didn't you see about the forest fire
all around Sweetwater?

156
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,428
I did. What about it?

157
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,262
-Jeff put that out himself.
-Himself?

158
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,597
If you really want a senator--

159
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,568
I do not want a senator.

160
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,571
I do not want any more nonsense.

161
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,437
He's the greatest American we got.

162
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,010
He can tell you
what George Washington said, by heart.

163
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,444
And Stuff has the swellest
stuff in it.

164
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,741
What "stuff"?

165
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,782
Boys' Stuff.
The name of Jeff's paper.

166
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,011
He prints it. Look, here's one.

167
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,587
Everybody reads it.

168
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,452
All the kids in the state.
A million of them. Let me read--

169
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,561
I'm in no mood
to listen to childish prattle.

170
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,593
Prattle?

171
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,822
You're all wet.

172
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,363
You couldn't do better.

173
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,330
-Better than what?
-Jeff for senator.

174
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,764
Emma, if you please!

175
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,336
Want to get out of a pickle, don't you?

176
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,131
Always looking for votes, aren't you?

177
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,468
Here's 50,000 kids, two folks each,
and they vote.

178
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,200
If you want to do some good
in this state--

179
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,379
If you're ever going to
stand up like a man--

180
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,672
That settles it!

181
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,179
I won't be belittled by my own children
in my own home.

182
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,377
All my nerves are strained
to the breaking point!

183
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:43,686
Henry Hill....

184
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,152
Horace Miller....

185
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,950
Miller? Hill?

186
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,057
Hill?

187
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,228
Miller?

188
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,762
Heads, Hill.

189
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,589
Tails, Miller.

190
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,584
That's good enough for me.

191
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,907
Good evening.

192
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,981
Is Jefferson Smith at home?

193
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,151
Won't you step in?

194
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,329
-A Boy Ranger to the U.S. Senate?
-Listen.

195
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,165
The simpleton of all times.
A big-eyed patriot.

196
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,205
Knows Lincoln
and Washington by heart.

197
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,400
Stands at attention
in the governor's presence.

198
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,341
Collects stray boys and cats.

199
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,707
He does what?

200
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,974
You know, a perfect man.

201
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,617
Never in politics in his life.

202
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,879
Wouldn't know what it's all about
in 2 years, let alone 2 months.

203
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,181
The important thing...

204
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,415
...this was the genius of the stroke...

205
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,991
...it means votes.

206
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,652
The hero of 50,000 boys
and 1 00,000 parents.

207
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,230
Look over those congratulations
pouring in.

208
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,764
I tell you, gentlemen--

209
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,801
You made this appointment
without asking me.

210
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,997
When lightning strikes--
-You didn't ask me.

211
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,270
Now wait a minute, Jim.

212
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,941
Happy may have hit on something here.

213
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,309
There, you see?

214
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,716
Do you really think you can
handle him in Washington?

215
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,617
Do you think it's all right?

216
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,086
I think it's all right.

217
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,520
A young patriot...

218
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,558
...recites Lincoln and Jefferson...

219
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,425
...turned loose in our nation's capitol.

220
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,827
I think it's all right.

221
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,471
Chick.

222
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,439
Turn the ballyhoo boys loose. It's
the greatest appointment ever made.

223
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,305
Give a banquet and declare a holiday.

224
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,447
A star-spangled banquet!

225
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,989
And how did your governor
confer that honor?

226
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:37,151
Did he give it to some wealthy
citizen, merely to curry favor?

227
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,752
No!

228
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,766
Did he give it to some
unworthy political hireling?

229
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,267
What did he do?

230
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,439
He went down...

231
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,937
...among the people.

232
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,731
And there he found...

233
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,745
...a nugget.

234
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,512
It is in that spirit that
we're here tonight...

235
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,213
...to acclaim and wish Godspeed
to Senator...

236
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,656
...Jefferson Smith.

237
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,727
Thank you.

238
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,704
I can't help feeling...

239
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,143
...that there's been a big mistake
somehow.

240
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,144
Of course, I never could see...

241
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,551
...why we needed two senators
from this state...

242
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,125
...when we have a man like
Joseph Harrison Paine...

243
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,625
...representing us.

244
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,922
He doesn't remember me.

245
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,965
He knew my father very well.

246
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,828
Clayton Smith.

247
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,026
They...

248
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,971
...went to school together.

249
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,108
They were very good friends.

250
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,978
Just to...sit here with him...

251
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,616
...is a very great honor for me...

252
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,083
...because I remember Dad
used to tell me that...

253
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,884
...Joe Paine was the finest man
he ever knew.

254
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,854
Go on, get up. Take a bow!

255
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:29,365
I don't think I'll be much help to you
down there in Washington, senator.

256
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,073
I'll do my best.

257
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,971
Although with all my might...

258
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,514
...I can promise you one thing:

259
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,412
I'll do nothing to disgrace
the office of...

260
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,452
...United States Senate.

261
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,546
Senator Jefferson Smith...

262
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,220
...the Boy Rangers are very proud...

263
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,051
...to take this opportun--

264
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,590
Occasion!

265
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,922
We are happy to take this opportunity--

266
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,328
To present....

267
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,433
To resent this...

268
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,769
...small token
of our affection and esteem...

269
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,831
...to the best--

270
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,005
Friend!

271
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,270
Aw, heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff.

272
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,468
We all pitched in.

273
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,706
For to carry your laws when
you get to Washington.

274
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,488
It isn't much,
but if you insist, here's this week's.

275
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,716
Boys' Stuff.
Why, printer's ink runs in your veins.

276
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,620
You're just like your father.

277
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,388
-Thank you, sir.
-Even to the hat.

278
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,430
Same old dreamer too.

279
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,534
One look at you and I can see him...

280
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,103
...back at his roll-top desk,
hat and all, getting out his paper.

281
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,038
Always kept his hat on
so as to be ready to do battle.

282
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,735
Clayton Smith, editor and publisher.

283
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,744
And champion of lost causes.

284
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,942
Dad used to say the only causes
worth fighting for were the lost causes.

285
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,584
You don't have to tell me.

286
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,415
We were a team, the two of us.

287
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,285
Struggling editor
and the struggling lawyer.

288
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,086
The twin champions of lost causes,
they called us.

289
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,593
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.

290
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,266
His last fight was his best, Jeff.

291
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,495
He and his little four-page paper...

292
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,968
...against that mining syndicate.

293
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,337
All to defend the right of one
small miner who stuck to his claim.

294
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,239
They tried everything.

295
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,107
Bribery...

296
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,076
...intimidation.

297
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,709
And then....

298
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,818
Ma found him slumped over his desk
that morning.

299
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,988
Shot in the back.

300
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,195
I was there.

301
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,298
I can see him.

302
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,592
At that old roll-top desk.

303
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,466
Still with his hat on.

304
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,874
Still with his hat on.

305
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,607
I know.

306
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,682
I suppose, Mr. Paine...

307
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,581
...when a fellow bucks up
against a big organization like that...

308
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,417
...one man by himself
can't get very far, can he?

309
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:10,984
Washington, huh?

310
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,057
Yes, senator, for the fifth time.
Washington.

311
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,262
I'd better see about my pigeons.

312
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,730
The porter has them.

313
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,904
Just a second. I'd better make sure.

314
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,966
Joe, my head's like a balloon.

315
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,440
Two whole days! I never knew
there was so much American history.

316
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,907
They're all right.

317
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,081
That's fine. That ends that crisis.

318
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,749
Come along, senator.

319
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,577
Hello, Father!

320
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,183
-I saw!
-He's mine!

321
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,987
Let me get to him.

322
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,154
I don't care to meet him
till I get my money.

323
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,860
A dollar each, please,
for the milk fund.

324
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,289
That's $5.

325
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,632
You've got $5, haven't you?

326
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,740
Can't seem to find anything
except keys.

327
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,809
Jeff, this is my daughter Susan
and her friends.

328
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,572
-Not the new senator?
-He's marvelous.

329
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,715
What have you got there, senator?

330
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,876
-They're pigeons.
-To carry messages back to Ma.

331
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,989
It's just for fun. The one that
makes it home in the best time...

332
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,419
...I'll enter in the Nationals.

333
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,990
-Joe!
-Hello, Chick.

334
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,957
-Hello, Joe.
-Carl, how are you?

335
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,390
Glad to see you, Bill.

336
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,332
Jeff, come here.

337
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,161
Meet Cook and Griffith,
from State Headquarters.

338
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,566
Great pleasure.
You'll do the old state proud.

339
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,834
Welcome. The wildlife here is
different from what you're used to.

340
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,543
They wear high heels.

341
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,937
We must see a lot of you...

342
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,675
-...and your little feathered friends.
-Thank you very much.

343
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,811
Come on, Father.

344
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,086
Chick.

345
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,951
I've got him.
We'll be along.

346
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,183
Good luck, senator.

347
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,382
Goodbye.

348
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,830
Things sure happen fast around here.

349
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,295
You'll have to get yourself
out of low gear.

350
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,628
Let's get these bags and livestock.

351
00:18:58,837 --> 00:18:59,826
Okay, Chick.

352
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,906
Look, there it is!

353
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,735
Who? What?

354
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,700
The Capitol dome.

355
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,174
Yes, sir, big as life.

356
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,904
Been there a long time now.

357
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,104
Yes, sir.

358
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,244
This way, senator.

359
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,924
We thought we'd
meet him in short pants...

360
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,392
...with hatchets.

361
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,621
Taxi.

362
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,398
What's he got pigeons for?

363
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,590
What for?

364
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,196
Suppose there's a storm.
The lines are down.

365
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,839
How you going to get messages
back to Ma?

366
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,303
This way, senator.

367
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,737
Where is he?

368
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:39,933
Senator?

369
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,939
I told that Cookie to....

370
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,205
Let's find him.

371
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,404
Senator!

372
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,974
Senator Smith?

373
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,617
Positively not in the station.

374
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,719
What happened?

375
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,422
Did you look in the--?

376
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,084
I'll brain that guy.

377
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,159
Call Paine. Call Saunders.

378
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,091
Call the Marines. Call somebody!

379
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:00,199
Saunders?

380
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,063
Saunders?

381
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,198
McGann.

382
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,234
Has Smith showed up
at his office there yet?

383
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,268
What do you mean, the slip?
What's so funny?

384
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,404
Nothing.

385
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,131
Why don't you try a butterfly net?

386
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,570
If he shows up...

387
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,143
...Paine's waiting at the hotel
with newspapermen.

388
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,473
Let him know right away.
Understand?

389
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,174
I'll hang a light in the belfry.
One if by land and two if by sea.

390
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,130
-Diz?
-Yeah.

391
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,197
What do you think?

392
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,731
Daniel Boone's lost.

393
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,467
Lost in the wilds of Washington.

394
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,798
If your boyfriend's
going to blaze trails...

395
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,236
...I'm going to the press club.

396
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,435
Stick around. He might want us to
put on short pants and go hiking.

397
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,170
You wouldn't want to
miss the exercise.

398
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,440
When I think of exercise,
I have to lie down...

399
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,844
...until the feeling leaves me.

400
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,809
Wouldn't it be funny
if he was lost?

401
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,987
The Boy Ranger?

402
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,450
Oh, he'll show up.

403
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,715
He must have a compass with him.

404
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,419
Where would I go
if I were a Boy Ranger?

405
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,789
Boy, am I tired. I'm all in!

406
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,398
Call all the hospitals.
And get me a bed while you're at it!

407
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,830
Boss, will you hold this
a minute?

408
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,367
Thank you, sir.

409
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,432
Here! Come back here!

410
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,600
--that from these honored dead
we take...

411
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,781
...increased devotion that
that cause for which they...

412
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,142
...gave the last full measure...

413
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,977
...of devotion...

414
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,153
...that we here highly....

415
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,844
-Resolve.
-Resolve...

416
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,383
...that these dead
shall not have died in vain.

417
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,151
That this nation...

418
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,797
...under God, shall have
a new birth of....

419
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:27,987
Freedom.

420
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,230
Freedom.

421
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,561
And that government, of the people...

422
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:32,869
...by the people...

423
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:33,969
...for the people...

424
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,936
...shall not perish from the earth.

425
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,813
Why don't they try the police?

426
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,644
Call out some bloodhounds...

427
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,013
...or lndian guides.

428
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,688
One place he knows
is the Senate office.

429
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,413
You stay there and wait.

430
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,955
All right,
another half-hour.

431
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,627
Just one half-hour.
Goodbye.

432
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,897
Oh, why don't I quit?

433
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,430
Eight to five,
little boy blue's plastered.

434
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,625
When Foley died, why didn't
I clear out?

435
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,896
How many times have I said
I'm fed up with politics and l--

436
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,765
No, I let them
talk me into staying.

437
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,003
Secretary to a leader
of little squirts.

438
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,214
Why? Because I need the job
and a new suit of clothes.

439
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,748
Would you settle for a husband?

440
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,113
I sure would.

441
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,685
You know my old standing offer.

442
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,060
Diz Moore...

443
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,785
...poet of Washington correspondents.

444
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,827
Oh, that again.

445
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,228
I'd cherish you...

446
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,626
...and I'd stay sober.

447
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,462
Diz, you're a wonderful egg.

448
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:43,770
I don't know, maybe if I saw you once
with your hair combed or something....

449
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,434
I don't think even
that would do it.

450
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,737
No point in combing
my hair for nothing.

451
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,471
"Honorary appointment."

452
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:55,983
Scratch this and you'll find they need
a dope here for a couple of months.

453
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,883
Yes?

454
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,121
Yes!

455
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,824
What do you want?

456
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,258
Office of Jefferson Smith?

457
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,322
The man downstairs said--

458
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,308
They sure must have
picked the prize dummy--

459
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,144
Say, wait a minute!

460
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,543
That wouldn't be Daniel Boone?

461
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:27,985
Say, mister...

462
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,050
...what's your name?

463
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,186
Jefferson Smith.

464
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,582
Oh, yes, please...

465
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,156
...come right in, Mr. Smith.
This way.

466
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:35,484
Now, hold everything.

467
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,889
Stay there. Now, don't move!

468
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,090
Helen! Get me the Madison.
Senator Paine.

469
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,766
Hurry up, will you?

470
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,432
Is anything the matter?

471
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,729
My dear senator...

472
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,737
...it may be customary out on the
prairie to take leave of people...

473
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,603
...and not show up for five hours--

474
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,439
I'm very sorry
about that, Miss Sau--

475
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,410
You are Miss Saunders, aren't you?

476
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,813
Yes, and this is Mr. Moore, member
of the press. Mr. Moore, meet...

477
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,179
...the senator.

478
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,979
I'm very happy to know you.

479
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,714
I see you cut your way
through that forest.

480
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,326
Senator Paine. We've got him!

481
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,997
Came in on his own power,
and he's sober.

482
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,592
Next thing on the schedule,
I'll have him over there.

483
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,632
Now....

484
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,202
I'm awfully sorry.

485
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,306
It wasn't until I was well along
on the bus that--

486
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,668
Did you say bus?

487
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,504
It was one of those
sightseers, you know?

488
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,974
And...

489
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,648
...I've never been called
absent-minded before...

490
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,049
...but there it was, all of a sudden.

491
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,256
It was staring at me
through the station doors.

492
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,756
There what was?

493
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,259
The dome. The Capitol dome.

494
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,789
As big as life, sparkling away
under the old sun out there.

495
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,528
And l...

496
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,600
...I just...

497
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,966
...started to go toward it.

498
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,903
There was a bus outside and...

499
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,838
...I just naturally got aboard.

500
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,240
Most natural thing in the world.

501
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,946
I don't think I've ever been so
thrilled in my whole life.

502
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,379
And that Lincoln Memorial!

503
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,522
Gee whiz!

504
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,658
Why, Mr. Lincoln, there he is.

505
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,298
He's looking right straight
at you as you come up those steps.

506
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,895
Just sitting there, like he was
waiting for somebody to come along.

507
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,831
Well, he's got nothing on me.

508
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

509
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,204
If you're ready,
we'll go to the hotel.

510
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,539
Senator Paine's waiting for you.

511
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:47,785
This is my office?

512
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,586
No, you'll have a private office.

513
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,628
-ln there.
-Private office?

514
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,528
In there?

515
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,104
Right in this door?

516
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,037
All right, now, senator....

517
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,715
Where is he?
Has he gone out again?

518
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,417
He's in there.

519
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,915
I'll see you later.

520
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,782
I got to go out
and drink this over.

521
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,383
Whose statue's that?

522
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,255
I wouldn't know, in the daytime.

523
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,929
You wouldn't? Oh, look!

524
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,399
Look at the Capitol dome!
It's all lighted up.

525
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,570
You better relax, senator.
You'll get yourself plum wore out.

526
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,832
Gee whiz! So many things
happening all at once.

527
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,510
Miss Saunders, what time
does the Senate....

528
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,770
Convene?

529
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,138
-Twelve noon.
-Twelve noon, huh?

530
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,816
Oh, boy, that'll be something!

531
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,618
You know what I better do
in the morning?

532
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,413
No, what had you better?

533
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,853
I think I better go out
to Mount Vernon.

534
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,219
Be sort of a fine thing to do.

535
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,961
Visit Washington's home before walking
into the Senate for the first time.

536
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,154
Think it's a good idea?

537
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,335
Wonderful! Puts you
right in the mood.

538
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,299
What's that? What's that?

539
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,801
Movie houses.

540
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,170
Hi, Saunders.

541
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,177
I'm still asking myself, what is he:

542
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,713
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

543
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:19,781
Maybe an oyster.

544
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,885
When I think of myself playing straight
for that phony, patriotic chatter. Me!

545
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,250
Carrying bibs for an infant
with little flags in his fists.

546
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,825
I can't take it, Diz.
I quit. I'm through.

547
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,998
Now take it easy.
Simmer down. Here.

548
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,393
Take this.

549
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,864
Know what he's doing tomorrow
before taking the Senate seat?

550
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,595
Going up to Mount Vernon...

551
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,036
...to get in the mood.
A warm-up.

552
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,231
Who? Your boss?

553
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,139
A nut! I knew there was
a story in him. I smelled it!

554
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,938
Go chase an ambulance.

555
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,673
It's meat and drink to me.
Let me at him five minutes.

556
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:53,782
I'll make it right.

557
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,612
What do you mean "right"?

558
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,117
I'll tell you what I'll do.

559
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,619
World Series. A pass!

560
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,848
In a month it'll be worth 1 5 bucks.

561
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:01,957
Well!

562
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,092
You're not talking to this guy.

563
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,124
What do you say?

564
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,227
Nothing. Beat it.

565
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,660
How would your pals like
to get in on this?

566
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,060
-I want a scoop.
-Beat it!

567
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,964
That's out. Either it's lots of
reporters and tickets, or....

568
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,765
Better call him before
I change my mind.

569
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,306
Okay. I'll see you right here.

570
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,809
What are you going to do?

571
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,846
Get my whole fall outfit
and quit this job in style.

572
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,916
You've got more sense
than to put Nosey on to that guy.

573
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,782
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

574
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,188
Tell us about yourself.

575
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,553
I hear you got a boys' club, senator.

576
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,194
Any special ax to grind?

577
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,522
-Ax?
-You know.

578
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,961
Pet idea. Save the buffaloes,
pension bill.

579
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,260
You must have one idea that would
be good for the country.

580
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,960
Well, I have got one idea.

581
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,763
That's what we want.

582
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,271
For the last couple years,
I've thought it would be...

583
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,707
...a wonderful idea to have a
national boys' camp in our state.

584
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,813
Boys' camp?
Sure. Very good!

585
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,415
If we could get
poor kids off the streets...

586
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,552
...out of the cities for
a few months in the summer...

587
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,120
...and let them learn something
about nature...

588
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,483
...American ideals....

589
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,749
Marvelous.

590
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,449
What would it
cost the government?

591
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,754
Nothing. Nothing at all.
You see...

592
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,989
...the government just
lends us the money for the camp...

593
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,133
...and then the boys...

594
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,771
...pay it back by sending pennies,
nickels, nothing more than a dime.

595
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,439
That's really something.

596
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,070
Government's got enough
to do without--

597
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,972
The government's
putting too much dough...

598
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,771
...in too many places now, boys.

599
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,006
Well, now, senator, tell me...

600
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,808
...what do you think of
the girls in this town?

601
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,816
Down at the station,
four of them...

602
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,421
...kissed me when
I got off the train.

603
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,555
Were they pretty?
-Pretty?

604
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,091
That Miss Susan Paine...

605
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,160
...is about the
prettiest I ever saw.

606
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,662
Senator, you got a good eye!

607
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,527
How about some more pictures?

608
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,100
You're a nature lover...

609
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,793
...can you handle sign language?

610
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,063
I could manage, if--

611
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,741
What about birdcalls?
You know any?

612
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,706
-Can you make a sound like an eagle?
-How about a bobwhite?

613
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,005
Here's one. I'm the
only one in the state...

614
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,212
...that knows this one.

615
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,643
We could use that!

616
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,103
His "First 'Whiff' of Washington"?

617
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,706
Do I actually see this?

618
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,436
What is it?

619
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,282
Did you want to see me?

620
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,545
What's this I hear about your quitting?
-I'm not a nurse.

621
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,687
Stop being funny.

622
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:45,856
How'd this happen?

623
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:49,857
-I haven't the slightest idea.
-Yes, you have. How'd it happen?

624
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,392
I merely took him home.

625
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:54,258
I didn't tuck him in.
That's McGann's job.

626
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,662
McGann just phoned. Smith's
gone again. Do you know where?

627
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,861
He went to Mount Vernon
to give himself a patriotic address.

628
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,403
That's fine.

629
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,905
Now you go back to Smith's office...

630
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,100
...and get him
to the Senate by 1 2:00.

631
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,211
Senator, I wasn't
given a brain...

632
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,541
...just to tell a Boy Ranger
the time.

633
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,773
Don't be a fool.

634
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,315
If certain things happen...

635
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,079
...you'll get one of the biggest jobs
in Washington.

636
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:21,088
When I came here, my eyes were
big blue question marks...

637
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,055
...now they're big
green dollar marks.

638
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,353
Smart girl, eh?

639
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,593
Finish this job properly
and you'll get a bonus.

640
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,164
I mean, keep Smith away...

641
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,961
...from anything that
smacks of politics.

642
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,864
Including Willet Creek Dam?

643
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,265
Including Willet Creek Dam.

644
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,205
Now go back to your work.

645
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,778
This is it, senator.

646
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,612
The United States Senate.

647
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,651
Come on.

648
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,525
Mr. Carson, Senator Smith.

649
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,557
-How do you do?
-How do you do, senator?

650
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,626
Page!

651
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,195
-Glad to see you.
-Thank you.

652
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,366
Show Senator Smith to his seat.

653
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,693
Right this way, sir.

654
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,664
Well, goodbye.

655
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,736
Wish me luck.
-Sure.

656
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,133
Bye.

657
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,226
So that's the boy wonder?

658
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,063
I don't know what the Senate's
coming to.

659
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,497
-Hi, Diz.
-Hello, Saunders.

660
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,198
Daryl, Sweeney.

661
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,971
I see you got Daniel Boone
in all right.

662
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,737
Daniel in the lion's den.

663
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,977
Nice job you and
the ambulance chasers did...

664
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,115
...in the papers this morning.

665
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,545
-Did you like it?
-Great.

666
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,883
Here you are, Senator.

667
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,421
Not a bad desk, either.

668
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,616
Daniel Webster used to use it.

669
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,158
Daniel Webster sat here?

670
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,420
Holy mackerel!

671
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,893
Give you something to shoot at,
if you figure on doing any talking.

672
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,624
I'm just going to
sit and listen.

673
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,735
That's the way to get re-elected.

674
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,201
This is the calendar for the day.

675
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,532
You'll find this
and a manual, in here.

676
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,709
Anything else...

677
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,104
...just snap for a page.

678
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,835
Where's the majority leader?

679
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,104
Majority leader?

680
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,976
Right over there.
Senator Agnew.

681
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,844
That's Senator Barnes,
the minority leader.

682
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,350
Where's the press gallery?

683
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,989
There,
above the vice president's chair.

684
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,024
Those in the front row
represent the big news services.

685
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,216
What's up there?

686
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,328
That's for guides
and sightseers...

687
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,556
...who come in for five minutes
at a time to rest their feet.

688
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,762
That section is reserved
for the senators' friends.

689
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,402
Front row, the empty one, is for
the President and his guests.

690
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,437
I see.

691
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,041
Over the clock
is the diplomatic section.

692
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,914
They and the pageboys are the only
real class we have here.

693
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:02,085
-Thanks so much.
-I'll take your hat to the cloakroom.

694
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,015
I want to give you
a Boy Ranger button.

695
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,052
Swell!

696
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,917
What's your name?
-Richard Jones.

697
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,284
Thanks ever so much.

698
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,492
Good luck, senator.
Keep your left up.

699
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:15,029
-See you in the White House, Joe.
-You're not kidding!

700
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,859
-Jeff.
-Hello, senator.

701
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,092
I was in committee.

702
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,394
That's all right, sir.

703
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,629
I see you had a little publicity.

704
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,533
Have you got your credentials?

705
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,576
Miss Saunders gave them to me.

706
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,970
Is that right?

707
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,141
That's fine.

708
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,284
When the vice president
calls you...

709
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,750
-...I'll meet you in the center aisle.
-Center aisle.

710
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:40,856
This is Daniel Webster's desk.
Did you know that?

711
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,457
He won't mind.

712
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,887
The Senate will come to order.

713
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,992
Chaplain will pray.

714
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,557
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father...

715
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:21,959
...in these critical days...

716
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:26,068
...when our beloved country labors with
such grave problems...

717
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,567
...Iook upon us...

718
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:31,208
...and give us the strength
to be just and merciful...

719
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,377
...so we may best
serve our people...

720
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,511
...and our fellow men
everywhere.

721
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:36,971
Amen.

722
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,216
-Clerk will read--
-Mr. President...

723
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:51,191
...I ask unanimous consent the reading
of the journal be dispensed with.

724
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,726
Is there objection?

725
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,759
Journal stands approved.

726
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,262
Mr. President.

727
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,196
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

728
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,369
Clerk will call the roll.

729
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,367
-Mr. Agnew.
-Here.

730
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:02,698
-Mr. Albert.
-Here.

731
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,101
-Mr. Alfred.
-Here.

732
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,504
88 senators have answered
to their names, all as present.

733
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,442
-Mr. President.
-Senator Paine.

734
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,446
I present the credentials of
Honorable Jefferson Smith...

735
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,518
...who has just been appointed
by the governor of my state.

736
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,154
The designate is present.

737
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,154
I ask that the oath of office be
administered at this time.

738
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,793
The senator designate will
present himself.

739
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,129
The oath will be administered.

740
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,979
Mr. President...

741
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,809
...I rise to a question of order.

742
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,542
-Here it comes.
-I seek to ascertain if the gentleman...

743
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:54,248
...about to be sworn in is aware
of the responsibilities of his office.

744
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,653
I refer to his
shameless performance...

745
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:57,953
...for the newspapers.

746
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,296
A versatile performance,
I grant you...

747
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,262
...and one that his party,
no doubt, will applaud.

748
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,735
But one that lowers his rank...

749
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,167
...to the level of a
sideshow entertainer...

750
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,933
...and reflects on the sincerity,
if not the sanity...

751
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,703
...of the highest body
of lawmakers in the land.

752
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,006
I seek to learn if this
is the gentleman's conception...

753
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,614
...of the nature of his office.

754
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,715
I don't understand.

755
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,513
The designate has no voice here
until taking the oath of office.

756
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,986
Mr. President,
I will answer the gentleman.

757
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,625
My colleague was innocent
in this matter.

758
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,317
He was completely misquoted.

759
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,987
I know Jefferson Smith, and I will
personally vouch for him.

760
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,828
He has the greatest respect for his
office and for these gentleman.

761
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,502
Mr. President.

762
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,566
The swearing in of the senator
designate is the order of business.

763
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,005
The gentleman will raise
his right hand.

764
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,473
Do you swear to support...

765
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,512
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

766
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,411
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

767
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,213
...and that you will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same?

768
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,549
That you take this obligation freely...

769
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,818
...without mental reservation
or purpose of evasion...

770
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:08,931
...and that you will faithfully
discharge the duties of this office...

771
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,027
...so help you God?

772
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:12,763
I do.

773
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,871
Senator, you can talk
all you want to now.

774
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,269
Meet the majority leader.

775
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,809
He'll be a good friend to you.

776
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,138
How do you do, sir?

777
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,907
Any friend of Joe's
is a friend of mine.

778
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:29,279
Don't worry about the others,
they're just senators.

779
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,888
-Mr. President.
-Senator MacPherson.

780
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,853
The shameless way the
deficiency bill has been delayed...

781
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,857
...is nothing short of criminal.

782
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:42,123
Government agencies are
in desperate need of these funds.

783
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,326
The prime business of this body
is the immediate passage....

784
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,574
-Hello, Nosey. Who let you in here?
Why aren't you chasing ambulances?

785
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,681
Smith's punching everybody
he meets. I just got away.

786
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,941
Uh-oh, Tarzan!

787
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,991
Boys, meet Senator Smith.

788
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,425
You act like
something's on your mind.

789
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,430
Why don't you tell the people
the truth?

790
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,431
-The truth?
-He wants the truth!

791
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:54,934
The man wants the truth.

792
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,107
"'What is the truth?' said
jesting Pilate...

793
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,832
...and would not stay for an answer."

794
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,102
How do you want it?
Dished out or in a bottle?

795
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,809
People pick up their papers,
and what do they read?

796
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:08,212
This morning they read that a
clown arrived in Washington...

797
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,010
...parading like
a member of the Senate.

798
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,215
If you thought as much about being
honest as you do about being smart....

799
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,420
We're the only ones who can
be honest in what we tell the voters.

800
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:24,158
We don't have to be re-elected,
like politicians.

801
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,565
We tell them when phonies and
crackpots come here to make their laws.

802
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,932
If you want the truth,
why are you in the Senate?

803
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,608
What do you know about making laws?
Or what the people need?

804
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,640
I don't pretend to know.

805
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,334
Then what are you doing
in the Senate?

806
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,572
What's he doing?
Why, honorary appointment!

807
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,716
When the country needs men who know
and have courage as it never did before...

808
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,890
...he's going to decorate a chair
and get honored.

809
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,522
But he'll vote! Just like his
colleague tells him too.

810
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,526
Like a Christmas tiger,
he'll nod his head and vote...

811
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,029
..."Yes!"

812
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,825
You're not a senator.

813
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,569
You're an honorary stooge.
You ought to be shown up.

814
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,201
Have a drink, senator?

815
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,500
It'll taste better than the truth.

816
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,145
Hey, senator.

817
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,783
Don't let it get you down.

818
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,856
1 00 years from now,
nobody'll know the difference.

819
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:23,193
The point is, sir,
they're right.

820
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,490
The point is, sir,
they're right.

821
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:27,289
I'm just sitting in the Senate,
decorating a chair.

822
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,935
If I'm going to vote, I ought
to study the bills that are coming up.

823
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,100
The bills?

824
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:37,637
Yes, sir. Otherwise, I'm just a
Christmas tiger, like they said.

825
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:42,203
These bills are put together by
legal minds after long study.

826
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:46,042
I can't understand half of them
myself, and I was a lawyer.

827
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,184
Come on. Forget it.

828
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,148
I'll advise you how to vote.

829
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,254
I know you will.
That's the point.

830
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,424
There's no reason for me
to be here.

831
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:59,221
Didn't you say something about
wanting to create a national boys' camp?

832
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,921
-You were in earnest, weren't you?
-Yes, I was.

833
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,361
Why don't you do it?
There's a job for you.

834
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,695
Get a bill started.
Present it to Congress.

835
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,269
It will be great experience.

836
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:11,908
Senator Paine, I've been
aching to mention it to you.

837
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:15,704
If I could do that one thing
while I'm here, I'd feel--

838
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,381
What's to stop you?
Saunders will help you.

839
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,516
Well, I'll do it.
I will!

840
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,445
I knew if anyone could help me,
you could.

841
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,121
Thank you again for your time.

842
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,185
Good night.

843
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,051
Where are you running off to?

844
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,624
I'm anxious to get
back to the office.

845
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,662
The man on the front page!

846
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:39,029
-He just dropped in for a minute.
-How do you do, senator?

847
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,703
How do you do, Miss Paine?

848
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,132
I'm on my way to the office.

849
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,101
-How are the pigeons?
-They're fine.

850
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,901
I miss the dear little things.

851
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,840
I released one this morning
with a letter.

852
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,914
He flew right straight up in the air
to get his bearings.

853
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:57,178
He went around the Capitol dome,
then headed west, like a bat out of--

854
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,116
Just like a rifle shot.

855
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,553
I suppose by about this time...

856
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,852
...he's probably over Kentucky.

857
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,824
Isn't that wonderful, Father?

858
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,321
And was the letter to your girl?

859
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,025
No, I don't have a girl.

860
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,067
Don't you think I'd better
hold this for you?

861
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,034
No, I think I'd better go.

862
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,332
Good night.

863
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,302
Doggone!

864
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,012
It's all right, sir.

865
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,739
That's all right, my boy.
Don't bother.

866
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,080
Gee, I'm sorry.

867
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,122
Good night.

868
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,588
Good night, Jeff.

869
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,853
Good night.

870
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,201
Oh, Father!

871
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:52,672
Dear me!

872
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,003
At the expense of
some of the furniture...

873
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,679
...you've made another conquest.

874
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,108
Not old Honest Abe!

875
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,647
And with Honest Abe's ideals.

876
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,178
A rare man these days, Susan.

877
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:06,356
We're going ahead with it.

878
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,550
We're going ahead with it.

879
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:08,690
Ahead with what?

880
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,826
My bill for
a national boys' camp.

881
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,120
Where's my briefcase?

882
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,660
Do I understand...

883
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,058
...that you're going to present a bill?

884
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,256
Senator Paine and I decided--

885
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,991
Senator Paine decided with you?

886
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,398
I should have
been the one to think of it.

887
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,435
My dear senator...

888
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,699
...have you the faintest idea
how to get a bill passed?

889
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,900
No. You're going to help me.

890
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,408
If I were triplets I could.

891
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,604
Senator Paine said
you'd help me.

892
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,348
What do we have to have?

893
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,040
Look, do you mind...

894
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,221
...if I give you a rough idea
what you're up against?

895
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,411
No, go ahead.

896
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:45,084
A senator has a bill in mind,
like your camp, right?

897
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,262
What does he do?

898
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,124
He has to sit down
and write it.

899
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,823
The why, when, where, how
and everything else.

900
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:51,966
That takes time.

901
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,329
But this one is so simple.

902
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:55,337
I see. This one's simple.

903
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,666
-And with your help--
-Oh, I'm helping.

904
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:58,807
Simple, and I'm helping...

905
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:02,501
...so we knock it off in record time,
say three or four days.

906
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,271
Oh, a day.

907
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,642
-A day?
-Yes, just tonight.

908
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,116
Tonight.

909
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,809
I don't want to complain...

910
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,457
...but in civilized countries
there's an institution called "dinner."

911
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,017
I'm sort of hungry myself.

912
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:22,055
Couldn't we have some stuff brought
in on trays, like big executives?

913
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,699
Oh, sure.

914
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,868
Dinner comes in on trays.

915
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,367
We light into this--

916
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,938
And we finish the bill before morning.

917
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,165
It's dawn.

918
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,776
Your bill is ready. You introduce it.

919
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:35,808
How?

920
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,173
You get to your feet...

921
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,440
...take a breath,
and start spouting.

922
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,552
Not too loud. A couple of
the senators might want to sleep.

923
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,949
A curly-headed pageboy
takes it to the desk...

924
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,216
...where a clerk reads it,
refers it to a committee--

925
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,360
Committee, huh? Why?

926
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,264
Committees. Small groups
of senators have to sift a bill down...

927
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,662
...study it,
and report to the Senate.

928
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,701
Can't take a bill
nobody ever heard of...

929
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,237
...and discuss it among 96 men.
Where would you get?

930
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,499
I see that.

931
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,473
Good.
Now, where are we?

932
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,145
Some committee's got it.

933
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,278
Days are going by, senator.

934
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,279
Days, weeks!

935
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,345
Finally, they think it's quite a bill.

936
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,045
It goes to the House of
Representatives for a vote...

937
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,725
-...but waits on the calendar.
-Calendar?

938
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,754
That's the order of business.

939
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,827
Your bill has to stand back in line...

940
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,863
-...unless the steering committee--
What's that?

941
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,600
Steering committee?

942
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,004
Do you really think
we're getting anywhere?

943
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,074
Tell me, what's
the steering committee?

944
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,543
Committee of the
majority party leaders.

945
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,714
They decide when a bill is important
enough to be at the head of the list.

946
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:45,745
Well, this is.

947
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,412
Pardon me. This is.

948
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,244
Where are we now?
-Over in the House.

949
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,645
Oh, yeah. House.

950
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,916
More amendments, more changes,
and the bill goes back to the Senate.

951
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,289
The Senate doesn't like what the
House did; they make more changes.

952
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,895
The House doesn't like
those changes. Stymied.

953
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,088
So?

954
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,461
So they appoint men from each House
to go into a huddle...

955
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,694
...called a conference,
and they battle it out.

956
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:11,362
Finally, if your bill is still alive
after all this vivisection...

957
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,406
...it comes to a vote.

958
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,041
Yes, sir!

959
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,577
The big day finally arrives...

960
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,248
...and Congress adjourns.

961
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,844
Catching on, senator?

962
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,116
Shall we start right away
or order dinner first?

963
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:31,457
Pardon me?

964
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,356
I said, shall we start--

965
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:34,461
Oh, sure.

966
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:35,896
Why not?

967
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:39,000
Do you mind if I take the time
to go get a pencil?

968
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,500
-Go right ahead!
-Thank you very much.

969
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,764
Go right ahead.
And lots of paper too.

970
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,571
Now, the--
Doggone it!

971
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,678
Ever have so much to say about
something, you just couldn't say it?

972
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,474
-Try sitting down.
-I did. I got right back up.

973
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,084
Let's get down to particulars.

974
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,980
How big is this thing?
Where is it?

975
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,586
How many boys will it accommodate?

976
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,087
You've got to have all that
in it, you know?

977
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,758
And something else, Miss Saunders.

978
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:07,362
The spirit of it. The idea.

979
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,258
How do you say it?

980
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,800
That's what's got to be in it.

981
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:15,528
The Capitol dome.

982
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,538
On paper?

983
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,369
I want to make that come to life
for every boy in this land.

984
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,102
Yes, and all lighted up
like that too.

985
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:27,514
You see, boys forget what
their country means...

986
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,447
...by just reading "the land
of the free" in history books.

987
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,348
They get to be men
and forget even more.

988
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:38,225
Liberty is too precious a thing
to be buried in books, Miss Saunders.

989
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,262
Men should hold it up
in front of them...

990
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,830
...every single day of their
lives and say...

991
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,557
...I'm free...

992
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,164
...to think and to speak.

993
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,868
My ancestors couldn't.
I can...

994
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,335
...and my children will.

995
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,378
Boys ought to
grow up remembering that.

996
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,379
And that steering committee,
they've got to see it like that.

997
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,815
I know Senator Paine will do
all he can to help me, because--

998
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,715
He's a wonderful man, isn't he?

999
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,524
-He knew my father real well.
-He did?

1000
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:14,029
We need a lot more like him.
His kind of character, his ideals.

1001
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,489
Let's get on with this.

1002
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,498
This camp will be in your state?

1003
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:23,139
About 200 of the most beautiful
acres that ever were.

1004
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,467
You've never been
out in that country, have you?

1005
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,643
I've been over every single foot of it.

1006
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,277
You have to see it yourself.

1007
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:33,540
I don't know. The prairies, and
wind leaning on the tall grass...

1008
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,407
...Iazy streams down in the meadows...

1009
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,588
...angry little midgets of water
up in the mountains.

1010
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,882
Cattle moving down the slope,
against the sun.

1011
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,649
Campfires...

1012
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,861
...and snowdrifts....

1013
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,366
Everybody ought to have some
of that, sometime in his life.

1014
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,296
My dad had the right idea.

1015
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,399
He had it all worked out.

1016
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,605
He used to say to me, "Son...

1017
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,274
...don't miss the wonders
that surround you.

1018
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,478
Because every tree, every rock,
every anthill, every star...

1019
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,171
...is filled with
the wonders of nature."

1020
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,874
He used to say to me...

1021
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,054
..."Did you ever notice how grateful
you are to see daylight...

1022
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:15,918
...after coming through
a long, dark tunnel?"

1023
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,687
"Well," he'd say, "always try to see
life around you...

1024
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,864
...as if you just came
out of a tunnel."

1025
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,659
Where did you come from?

1026
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,939
I guess I've always lived
in a tunnel.

1027
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:32,463
You mean here?

1028
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,839
Baltimore. Pure city dweller.

1029
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,471
Have you always had to work?

1030
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,272
Since I was about sixteen.

1031
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,311
Sixteen?

1032
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,507
I take it your parents couldn't--

1033
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,015
No, Father was a doctor.

1034
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,654
He thought more of ethics
than he did of collections.

1035
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,483
Speaks well for Father,
but it wasn't so--

1036
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,425
Now, look, we'd better get back to this.

1037
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,125
Hasn't been easy, has it?

1038
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,456
No complaints.

1039
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,531
For a woman, you've done awfully well.

1040
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:58,998
Have l?

1041
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:05,306
I've never known anyone as capable
and intelligent....

1042
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,542
I don't know where I'd be in this
bill if it wasn't for your help.

1043
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,808
I don't know where you are with it.

1044
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,815
Gee whiz, we've got to get
going with this.

1045
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,888
All right, now, let's see.

1046
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:26,719
Everybody calls you just plain
"Saunders." Why can't l?

1047
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,056
Go right ahead.

1048
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,254
Saunders.

1049
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,626
That's much better.

1050
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,394
"Hello, Saunders."
"Good morning, Saunders."

1051
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,899
-"How's the bill coming, Saunders?"
-Terrible, thank you.

1052
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,009
Anyway, I got that "Saunders" business
straightened out.

1053
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,611
All right, now! I--

1054
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,371
What's your first name?

1055
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:46,807
Why?

1056
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,351
Everybody calls you
just "Saunders."

1057
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,315
I also answer to whistles.

1058
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:52,715
You've got a first name?

1059
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,516
Yes, but we just better
forget about it.

1060
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,283
All right, all right.

1061
00:54:58,662 --> 00:54:59,993
I was just curious.

1062
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:04,394
A picture popped into my mind of
a pump without a handle or something.

1063
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,727
Of course, I know what it is.
Violet.

1064
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,030
No, it isn't.

1065
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,071
Abigail?

1066
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,042
Letitia?

1067
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,576
Lena?

1068
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,541
You might as well tell me.
I've got a lot more.

1069
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,444
All right. You win.

1070
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,675
It's Clarissa.

1071
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,447
Clarissa.

1072
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,127
All right, Saunders, let's go!

1073
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,723
Now, Susan's an awfully
pretty name, isn't it?

1074
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:39,091
Susan? Susan Paine?
Oh, it's beautiful.

1075
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,737
She's a beautiful woman,
isn't she?

1076
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:47,009
Isn't she a beautiful girl?
I think she's about the most beautiful--

1077
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:51,213
We've got to get started on this,
or we'll never get it finished.

1078
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:54,281
Get set, because I'm going to talk
much faster than you can write.

1079
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,542
You ready?

1080
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,414
The location of this camp.
About 200 acres...

1081
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,817
...situated in Ambrose County,
Terry Canyon.

1082
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,687
Running a quarter mile on
either side of Willet Creek.

1083
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:06,659
What?

1084
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,423
Willet Creek. W-l-L-L-E-T.
It's a little stream.

1085
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:10,621
In Terry Canyon?

1086
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,563
You don't know it, do you?

1087
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,836
You've never been there, you said.

1088
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:20,474
You've discussed this with
Senator Paine, haven't you?

1089
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:21,609
No, no. Why?

1090
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,510
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

1091
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,342
There's no reason to
talk it over with him.

1092
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,747
"A quarter of a mile on
either side of Willet Creek."

1093
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:35,152
And the land to be bought by the
contribution of the boys...

1094
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,725
...the money to be loaned to us by
the United States.

1095
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,431
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1096
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,230
What did you get me
out of bed for?

1097
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,167
Sit tight.
The show's about to commence.

1098
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,273
Mind telling me what's going on?

1099
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:53,305
Certainly.

1100
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,274
There's the principal
actor in our little play.

1101
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,743
"Don Quixote" Smith, Man With Bill.

1102
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,475
-Here, one of the supporting characters.
Who?

1103
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,016
That gorilla in man's clothing,
McGann.

1104
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,744
You mean Puss-in-Boots?

1105
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,582
Mostly Puss.

1106
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:12,492
Another prominent character in
our play, the Silver Knight.

1107
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,152
Soul of honor on a tightrope.

1108
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,832
You wouldn't be a little goofy,
would you?

1109
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,029
Don Quixote will stand up in a
minute and speak two important words...

1110
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,329
..."Willet Creek."

1111
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,303
Then the Silver Knight
will fall off his tightrope...

1112
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:28,170
...and "Puss" will jump
out of his boots.

1113
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,502
It is so ordered.

1114
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,181
Introduction of new bills...

1115
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,941
...and joint resolutions.

1116
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,016
Mr. President!

1117
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:51,165
The chair recognizes the rather
strong-lunged junior senator...

1118
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:52,857
...Mr. Smith.

1119
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,794
I'm sorry.
I have a bill--

1120
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,939
You may speak a little louder.

1121
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:58,971
But not too loud.

1122
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,870
I have a bill to propose.

1123
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,444
Order, gentlemen.

1124
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:15,354
Our junior senator
is about to make a speech.

1125
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:21,695
You may proceed.

1126
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:33,037
"Be it enacted by the Senate
and the House of Representatives...

1127
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,468
...that there be appropriated
as a loan...

1128
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:40,848
...a sum sufficient to create
a national boys' camp...

1129
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:43,951
...to be paid back to the
U.S. Treasury...

1130
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,815
...by contributions from
boys of America.

1131
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:48,850
This camp...

1132
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,084
...to be situated on land at
and adjacent to...

1133
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:55,025
...the headwaters of a stream
known as Willet Creek...

1134
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:56,892
...in Terry Canyon...

1135
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:03,500
...for the purpose of bringing together
boys of all walks of life...

1136
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,207
...from various parts of the country.

1137
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,176
Boys of all creeds, kinds
and positions.

1138
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:16,782
To educate them in American ideals
and to promote mutual understanding.

1139
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,147
To bring about a healthful life...

1140
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,415
...to the youth of this
great and beautiful land."

1141
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:08,693
Our senator will make a good orator
when his voice stops changing.

1142
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:15,901
I'm getting leery of him. We call him
dumb, but he keeps getting in our hair.

1143
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:20,208
When he finds out a dam is going up
where he wants his boys' camp...

1144
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,680
...he's going to ask questions.

1145
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,944
Be quiet. I'm trying to think.

1146
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,421
This deficiency bill
will be read tomorrow.

1147
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,455
Tomorrow?

1148
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:33,151
He'll hear that section
on the Willet Dam. He can't be there.

1149
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:37,265
I'll take him to see monuments, even if
I have to hit him on the head with one.

1150
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,559
That won't work.

1151
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,861
This boy's honest, not stupid.

1152
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:42,660
Susan.

1153
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,568
My daughter won't carry out
such assignments.

1154
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,855
Senator!
If you let me handle your publicity--

1155
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,633
Down, everybody!

1156
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,303
Who are those people?

1157
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,600
Phonies, office seekers, cranks.

1158
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,540
"Get my son in or out of West Point--"

1159
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:28,240
This machine creates a fever 1 0 miles
away. It'll make you a fortune.

1160
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,409
Long-distance fevers.

1161
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,418
A woman wrote a song to replace
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

1162
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,181
Want to hear it?
-Not today.

1163
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,383
I feel like a house afire.
Even went to see Mr. Lincoln.

1164
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,323
-How did I do?
-Great.

1165
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,158
My heart was right up to here
all the time.

1166
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,664
What did Paine think?
-Tickled pink.

1167
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,358
Oh, boy! I hope so.

1168
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:51,532
What's all this?
-From boys who read about your camp.

1169
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,368
Already? All these letter--

1170
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:56,670
Those are only local. Wait till they
start pouring in from all over.

1171
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:01,179
You mean-- I'd better open one up.
Let's see what they say here.

1172
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,715
Look, there's money.
Let me see.

1173
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,813
"Dear Senator Smith...

1174
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:12,256
...I'd like to come to camp.
I shine shoes at the station.

1175
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:16,125
Here's 9 cents."
lsn't that wonderful?

1176
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:20,030
And he signs it, "Yours truly,
Stinky Moore."

1177
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,863
Isn't that marvelous?

1178
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:26,405
If there's money in each one of these,
what will we do with it?

1179
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,705
A bank! That's perfect.

1180
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:33,143
You can see how important
this bill will be. Is there any paper?

1181
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:34,873
Second drawer.

1182
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,449
That's fine.
I'll be pretty busy tonight.

1183
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,748
Not another bill?

1184
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,458
Letters. I'm busting with news!

1185
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,456
I introduced a bill.
Me, Jeff Smith!

1186
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,151
I spoke in the Senate!

1187
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,855
Want to dictate them?
-The letters? I couldn't talk letters.

1188
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,160
I'll sit here
and scratch them down.

1189
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,199
And say...

1190
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,869
...I'm going to tell Ma all about you.

1191
01:02:58,074 --> 01:03:02,909
And if I tell it right, you'll get the
best jar of preserves you ever tasted.

1192
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,137
Thank you very much.

1193
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:09,675
Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you.

1194
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:11,251
Don't mention it.

1195
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:16,351
Without you, I couldn't have, I mean....

1196
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,429
Who?

1197
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,691
Susan Paine.

1198
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:28,328
How do you do?
Yes, I can talk. Go right ahead.

1199
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,405
I'm sorry to bother you,
but you've got to help me.

1200
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,770
I'm elected to snatch Mr. Smith
from the Senate tomorrow.

1201
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:40,012
You're what?

1202
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:43,913
I'm to turn my glamour on for him.
You sympathize, don't you?

1203
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,245
Awkward, isn't it?

1204
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:48,423
Take him out and buy him
a suit of clothes that fits...

1205
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,819
...and a hat that he can hang on to.

1206
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:54,121
And a manicure and a haircut
wouldn't do any harm.

1207
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,925
As one woman to another,
I hate to ask you to do this, but....

1208
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,068
As one woman to another, of course.

1209
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,395
Thanks, and--

1210
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,832
Just a minute.

1211
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:04,972
Miss Paine.

1212
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,410
Susan Paine?

1213
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,636
She wants to talk to me?

1214
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,014
What does she...?

1215
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,508
Holy mackerel.

1216
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,188
Hello, Miss Paine.
How are you?

1217
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,090
Yes.

1218
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,451
Fine.

1219
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:30,395
What?

1220
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,197
What? Escort you?

1221
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:43,468
I'd be delighted.

1222
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,511
All right.

1223
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,513
Reception for a princess?

1224
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:49,641
She wants me to--

1225
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,217
Goodbye, Miss Paine.

1226
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,182
Goodbye.

1227
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,880
What do you know?
A reception for a princess.

1228
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,287
-Can you imagine?
-Get your hat.

1229
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:01,588
We have a lot of shopping to do
before tomorrow.

1230
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,756
Where are your bitters?

1231
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,800
In the thing there.
Behind the thing.

1232
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,105
I don't mind who gets licked
in a fair fight.

1233
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:16,106
It's these clouts below the belt
I can't take.

1234
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:20,609
Siccing that horrible dame on him
when he's goofy about her.

1235
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:22,514
What dame?

1236
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:23,774
Paine.

1237
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,954
Better be nice to her.

1238
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,717
Her dad's the party choice
for the White House.

1239
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,828
She may be the next
First Lady of the land.

1240
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:38,229
Imagine reading "My Day"
by Susan "Paine-ln-The-Neck."

1241
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,593
He isn't going to be hurt enough.
She has to twist a knife in him too.

1242
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,432
The regal jackass.

1243
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,835
"I'll turn my glamour on him,"
she says.

1244
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,135
What's it to you?

1245
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:50,107
Nothing. I'm just saying--

1246
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:51,905
Then stop worrying.

1247
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,776
I told you, the dopes
will inherit the earth.

1248
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:59,511
I wonder if this Don Quixote
hasn't got the jump on all of us.

1249
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:03,314
If it isn't a curse to go
through life wised up like you and me.

1250
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:07,724
If you're going to wonder,
let's go down and do it over a steak.

1251
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,857
Come on, snap out of it.
Drink up!

1252
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,898
Here's to bigger and better dopes.

1253
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,927
And to Don Quixote.

1254
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,763
Do you know how I felt?

1255
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,909
How did you feel? Quick.

1256
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:23,702
I felt just like a mother.

1257
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:28,176
Sending her kid off to school
for the first time.

1258
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:33,987
Watching the little fellow
toddling off in his best bib and tucker.

1259
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,491
Hoping he can stand up
to the other kids.

1260
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,591
Say, who started this?

1261
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,666
I'm just waiting for a streetcar.

1262
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,335
Well, cut it out, see?

1263
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,170
Who cares, anyway?

1264
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,840
I apologize.

1265
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,138
All right, then.

1266
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,878
After all, what's it to me?
So they drop him out of a balloon.

1267
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,520
All I care is,
I don't want to be around.

1268
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,282
I'm squeamish, see?
That's what I am.

1269
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,449
No, sir.

1270
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:15,962
I don't have to take it.
I won't be party to murder.

1271
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,099
I'm going to quit.
I'm through.

1272
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,700
Again?
It's a good idea.

1273
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:35,249
Let's get married.

1274
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,280
It's a good idea.

1275
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,887
When?

1276
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:40,180
Anytime.

1277
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,012
Tonight?

1278
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,585
You don't mind?

1279
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,760
I'd cherish you.

1280
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:51,132
You're a good egg, Diz.

1281
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,595
I know.

1282
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,869
Maybe we could clear out of this town.

1283
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,233
Get to feel like people.

1284
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:02,404
Live like we just got out of a tunnel.

1285
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,103
-Tunnel?
-A tunnel.

1286
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,517
You've never seen prairie grass...

1287
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:13,051
...with the wind leaning on it,
have you, Diz?

1288
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,019
Does the wind get tired out there?

1289
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,595
Or angry little mountain streams...

1290
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,595
...or the sun moving
against the cattle?

1291
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:29,135
You've never seen anything like that,
have you, Diz?

1292
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,233
Have you?

1293
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:37,272
Do we have to?

1294
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:41,940
I can't think of anything more sappy.

1295
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,918
Then let's get going.

1296
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,109
Where?

1297
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:47,621
We're getting married.

1298
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,757
That's right.

1299
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:55,657
In case you don't know, I want to
give you a chance to back out.

1300
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:56,695
What?

1301
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,763
My first name's Clarissa.

1302
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,435
I know. It's okay.

1303
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,735
Don't say "okay."
Say you think it's beautiful.

1304
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,703
Okay. I mean--

1305
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:10,845
You don't know any name offhand
that you like better, do you?

1306
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,411
Not offhand.

1307
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,845
Nothing like "Susan" or anything?

1308
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,039
Susan?

1309
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,245
I won't take it, see?

1310
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,681
I won't be party to murder, see?

1311
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:27,488
Steering a poor dope up blind alleys
for that Taylor mob is low enough...

1312
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:30,358
...but helping that dame
cut him in little bits...

1313
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:33,126
...nobody's going to make me do that!
No, sir.

1314
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:34,534
You said it.

1315
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:38,104
I'm going to get out of there right now.
Right now.

1316
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,775
Bonus or no bonus. I'm clearing out.

1317
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,968
Everything I own.
My extra hat, everything.

1318
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:45,736
Wait a minute.

1319
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:47,939
We're getting married!

1320
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,545
See you later.

1321
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,447
Saunders?

1322
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:06,828
What do you want?

1323
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,504
-You should have been there.
-I know.

1324
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,640
It was a wonderful party, and
your suit went over big...

1325
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,570
...and she looked beautiful.

1326
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,538
And when you left she said...

1327
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,406
..."Thank you, Mr. Smith."

1328
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:22,880
But it was the way she said it.
You nearly fell through the floor.

1329
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,279
Horseradish.

1330
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:36,562
What are you looking at?
You didn't think I was a lady, did you?

1331
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,562
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.

1332
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,395
Even I can't take it anymore. I quit.

1333
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,595
There's a lot I can't take.

1334
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,603
Can't take a simple--

1335
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,870
Why don't you go home?

1336
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,946
Tell your little streams about your camp
and the land of the free.

1337
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,313
This is no place for you.
You're halfway decent.

1338
01:10:58,520 --> 01:10:59,714
Now go home!

1339
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,622
That's all I wanted to tell you.

1340
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,550
Meet the man I'm going to marry.

1341
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:09,662
That's me.

1342
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:14,168
Say something.
Don't just stand there like a--

1343
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,336
Wait a minute.

1344
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,768
Why don't I do this right?

1345
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:23,767
So you want to be a senator?
Build a camp on Willet Creek?

1346
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:24,877
See this?

1347
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,545
Deficiency bill.

1348
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:30,776
Section 40. A dam going up where you
think your camp will be.

1349
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:33,181
Ever hear of it?

1350
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,756
They read about it in the Senate today,
but you didn't hear.

1351
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,450
That's why that ritzy dame
took you in tow.

1352
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:43,928
That's why they sent you here.
You don't know a dam from a bathtub.

1353
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,158
Go ahead.
Be a senator.

1354
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,269
Try and mess up
Mr. Taylor's little graft.

1355
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,029
But if you can't...

1356
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,209
...and you can't in 9 million years--

1357
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:58,871
Go home! Don't stay around here
making people feel sorry for you.

1358
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,647
Come on, Diz.

1359
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:08,680
Hey! This way.

1360
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:16,062
Come on, kid.
We'll dig up a preacher.

1361
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,196
We're going to get married.

1362
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,910
Come on, I'll take you home.

1363
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:39,555
There are 1 00 other places in the state
that really need the water.

1364
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:42,649
There are 1 00 other places in the state
that really need the water.

1365
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:46,918
Kenneth Allen owns some land there.
He didn't mention a dam.

1366
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:50,257
There's something wrong here.
I know there is.

1367
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:53,435
I won't vote on it till I get
some questions answered.

1368
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:56,126
-Jeff, you're fighting windmills.
-I am?

1369
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:59,739
Trying to understand everything about
a project that took two years to set up.

1370
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:03,571
-The reasons, the benefits.
-The benefits? Who is Taylor?

1371
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,179
What's he got to do with this?

1372
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,180
What makes you think
he's got anything to do with it?

1373
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:12,716
I've heard that this is all
his idea to get graft.

1374
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,257
Do you know what you're saying?

1375
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:21,259
You're accusing me of framing a bill
for one individual's benefit.

1376
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:24,364
Of helping to put through
a scheme for graft.

1377
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,494
Long distance?

1378
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,932
Get me James Taylor, Jackson City.

1379
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,729
Boy Ranger, eh? Answer to a prayer?
Manna from heaven.

1380
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,737
Didn't even know how to tell time.

1381
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:36,103
Will you tell me
exactly what he's done?

1382
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:39,144
He's about to blow the machine
to smithereens, and you with it.

1383
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,009
Me, Jim? How?

1384
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,116
You wouldn't understand that.

1385
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:46,549
Listen to me, Mr. Ten-Thumbs,
I'm on my way to Washington.

1386
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:51,419
No matter what happens, I'm all ready
for that Boy Ranger of yours.

1387
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,686
Take your instructions
from Ken Allen.

1388
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:56,296
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp.

1389
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:59,126
Use your high office to help Alan
get things done.

1390
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,529
Do you understand?

1391
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,170
I doubt it.
Come on, Alan.

1392
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:08,104
I haven't been able to show him a single
monument. Not even one that high.

1393
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,575
No, he's been on our tail.
You've got to keep this guy off of us.

1394
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:15,682
Ever since he found out we represent
the Creek, he's been running us ragged.

1395
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:19,376
I told you I'd handle him.
I object to you coming here like this.

1396
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,282
You proved how you can handle him.

1397
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,084
You're the one that started him
writing bills.

1398
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:25,919
Chick, let him in.

1399
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:30,064
-You didn't ask Smith here?
What do you think?

1400
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:33,063
Don't open that door.
Jim, you can't do this.

1401
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,170
Let him in, Chick.

1402
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,063
All right, Jim.

1403
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,740
You can count me out.

1404
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:45,376
Good morning, senator.
Come right in.

1405
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,048
What did you mean, count you out?

1406
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:57,123
You can't come here and
pull that steamroller stuff.

1407
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,089
Your methods won't do here.

1408
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,888
He's a senator.
However it happened, he's a senator.

1409
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,291
This is Washington.

1410
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:07,265
Steamroller stuff?
My methods don't go in Washington?

1411
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,868
They've done well by you.

1412
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:12,802
That's beside the point.
This boy's different. He's honest.

1413
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,476
He thinks the world of me.
We can't do it!

1414
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:19,443
What am I supposed to do? Stand around
and let that drooling infant...

1415
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:23,277
...wrap that Willet Creek Dam
appropriation around my neck?

1416
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:24,918
Not me.

1417
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:28,488
Either he falls in line with us...

1418
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,421
...or I'll break him so wide open
they'll never find the pieces.

1419
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:35,358
Jim, I won't stand for it.

1420
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,088
You won't stand for it?

1421
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:40,393
I don't want any part
of crucifying this boy.

1422
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:43,031
I see.

1423
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:48,542
Our steamroller methods are too hard
for your sensitive soul. Is that it?

1424
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:52,480
The Silver Knight
is getting too big for us.

1425
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,951
My methods have been all right
for the past 20 years.

1426
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:59,848
Since I picked you
out of a flyspecked hole-in-the-wall...

1427
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,182
...and made you look like a senator.

1428
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,222
And now you can't stand it?

1429
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,860
Maybe you don't have to stand it.

1430
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,259
Maybe we can fix it so you and the boy
can go home together.

1431
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:14,265
-You don't have to--
-It's all right, it's all right.

1432
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:19,734
Seems a shame, though, to part company
like this after all these years.

1433
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:23,901
Especially now, with a national
convention coming up.

1434
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:28,044
Joe, I put everything I have
behind you.

1435
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,343
And so did all of our friends.

1436
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,214
I guess we'll survive.

1437
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:37,184
We'll just find somebody else
who's got a little more sense.

1438
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:42,125
In the meantime, you go in and
explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam.

1439
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,731
It's your bill. It's your reputation.

1440
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,493
If he can't find enough facts
to break you with...

1441
01:16:47,703 --> 01:16:50,763
...send him to me.
I'll give him a couple of good ones.

1442
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:54,575
I'm taking the next plane home.
So long.

1443
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,516
Come here, will you?

1444
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,422
It's just that I like the kid.

1445
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,596
I don't want to see you
get too rough on him.

1446
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,362
I'm glad you came to your senses.

1447
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:25,096
You had me scared there for a minute.

1448
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:29,004
Go back to your office. I'll call you
when I get through with Smith.

1449
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,084
"The Silver Knight."

1450
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:51,195
Hello, senator.

1451
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,665
I was just passing through.
I thought I'd like to meet you.

1452
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,270
Sit down. You met all
the boys here, I suppose.

1453
01:17:57,472 --> 01:18:00,202
They say you've been
on your toes since you got here.

1454
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,899
That's fine.

1455
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:05,839
You know, some people told me
that you were dumb.

1456
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:07,538
I think you're smart.

1457
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:10,183
You're smart enough
to understand a situation...

1458
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,478
-...when it's explained to you.
-Like what?

1459
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,451
Well, for instance...

1460
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:16,351
...building a dam on Willet Creek.

1461
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,583
Just what's your interest in this?

1462
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,193
What's my interest?

1463
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:25,427
Anything that benefits the state
is mighty important to me.

1464
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:29,126
Owning a lot of its industry,
newspapers and other odds and ends.

1465
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:33,171
If I felt you had the welfare
of the state at heart like I have...

1466
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,037
...I'd say you were a man to watch.

1467
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,411
Now, what do you like?

1468
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,779
Business?

1469
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:42,040
If you do, you can pick any job...

1470
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,945
...in the state and go to the top.

1471
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,447
Or politics.

1472
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:50,214
If you like being senator, there's
no reason why you can't come back...

1473
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,484
...and stay there
as long as you want.

1474
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,559
If you're smart.

1475
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,061
Now, you take the boys here,
or Joe Paine.

1476
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,857
They're doing all right.

1477
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,796
They don't have to worry about...

1478
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,095
...being re-elected or anything else.

1479
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,169
They're smart.

1480
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,270
They take my advice.

1481
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,405
You tell these men
and Senator Paine what to do?

1482
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:11,704
Why, yes.

1483
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:15,144
Joe Paine has been taking my advice
for the past 20 years.

1484
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:19,019
You're a liar.

1485
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:30,193
I've got to see Senator Paine.

1486
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,093
Senator Paine is out of town.

1487
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,291
Out of town?
He couldn't be.

1488
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:40,100
Hello, Jeff.
Come in.

1489
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,606
Did you have a talk with Taylor?

1490
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:46,305
He said he's told you
what to do for 20 years.

1491
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,380
I called him a liar.

1492
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,082
Come over here and sit down.

1493
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,345
I don't feel like sitting down.

1494
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,656
Oh, I know how you feel.

1495
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,627
I was hoping you'd be
spared all this.

1496
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,126
I was hoping that you would...

1497
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,561
...see the sights, absorb some history,
and go back to your boys.

1498
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:09,328
You've been living in a boy's world.
For heaven's sake, stay there.

1499
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:10,664
This is a man's world.

1500
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:12,669
It's brutal,
and you've no place in it.

1501
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:16,640
You'll only get hurt. Take my advice.
Forget Taylor and what he said.

1502
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:18,745
Forget you ever heard
of Willet Creek Dam.

1503
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:21,142
But you still haven't
answered me, sir.

1504
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:25,547
Can a man like Taylor tell you
and those other men what to do?

1505
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,248
Listen, Jeff, please...

1506
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:31,519
...and try to understand.

1507
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,558
I know it's tough to run
head-on into facts.

1508
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:38,130
This is a man's world,
and you got to check your ideals...

1509
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,927
...outside the door,
like you do your rubbers.

1510
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:44,866
Now, 30 years ago I had your ideals.

1511
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,138
I was you.

1512
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:51,104
I had to make the same decision
you were asked to make today.

1513
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:52,610
And I made it.

1514
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:55,182
I compromised.

1515
01:20:56,351 --> 01:21:01,186
So I could sit in that Senate and
serve the people in 1 000 honest ways.

1516
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:03,451
You got to face facts.

1517
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,850
I've served our state well,
haven't l?

1518
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:09,656
We have the lowest unemployment
and the highest federal grants.

1519
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,027
But I've had to compromise.

1520
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:14,964
I've had to play ball.
You can't count on people voting.

1521
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,468
Half the time
they don't vote, anyway.

1522
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:21,540
That's how states and empires have been
built since time began, understand?

1523
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:31,075
You can take my word for it.
That's how things are.

1524
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,515
I've told you all this because...

1525
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:39,620
...I've grown very fond of you.

1526
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,560
About like a son, in fact.

1527
01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:46,022
And I don't want to
see you get hurt.

1528
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:51,904
When that deficiency bill comes up
tomorrow, don't say a word.

1529
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:55,372
Great powers are behind it,
who'll destroy you before you start.

1530
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,067
For your own sake...

1531
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,571
...and for the sake of
my friendship with your father...

1532
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:01,840
...please...

1533
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,909
...don't say a word.

1534
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,988
Owing to the urgency
of the deficiency bill...

1535
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:17,255
...there is a unanimous
consent agreement...

1536
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:20,832
...that no one will speak more than once
or longer than five minutes...

1537
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,266
...on any section of the bill.

1538
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:24,931
Clerk will read.

1539
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:30,573
"The bill for deficiency appropriations
for the fiscal year, Section One.

1540
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,041
On emergency relief:

1541
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,216
To create and erect
public improvements on rivers...

1542
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:37,408
...harbors and roadways,
$1 50 billion.

1543
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,017
Section 40:

1544
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,212
An appropriation to divert
and impound Willet Creek...

1545
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,086
...to the natural basin
of Terry Canyon, $5 million."

1546
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,123
Mr. President?

1547
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,658
Senator Smith desires
to be heard on Section 40?

1548
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:50,796
I do, sir.

1549
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:53,761
The senator understands
he's limited to five minutes?

1550
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:54,901
Yes, sir.

1551
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,002
You may proceed, sir.

1552
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:01,642
Mr. President, this section of the bill,
this dam on Willet Creek...

1553
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,242
...is nothing but--

1554
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:06,714
Does Senator Smith wish to
yield to his colleague?

1555
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,013
Why, yes, sir.

1556
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:10,741
You may proceed, senator.

1557
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,078
Mr. President...

1558
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,852
...I have risen to a difficult task...

1559
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,889
...to say from evidence
that has come to my attention...

1560
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:20,994
...I consider Senator Smith
unworthy to address this body.

1561
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:25,157
You boys go out
and get the senators.

1562
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:29,634
Something going on inside,
come on.

1563
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,738
The senator will suspend
until order is restored.

1564
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:39,906
All senators are
wanted on the floor, please.

1565
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:47,312
What's going on?
-I don't know.

1566
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:00,962
You may proceed.

1567
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:02,397
I refer to the bill...

1568
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:06,438
...he has introduced for
the creation of a national boys' camp.

1569
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:09,735
He named a portion of land
to be dedicated to that purpose...

1570
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:14,005
...and to be bought by contributions
from boys all over America.

1571
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:15,273
Senators...

1572
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:20,614
...I have evidence to prove my colleague
owns the land described in his bill.

1573
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:28,429
He bought it the day after his
appointment to the Senate...

1574
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:29,494
...and is holding it...

1575
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:33,133
...using his privileged office
for his own personal profit!

1576
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,136
Boy Ranger had a wreck.

1577
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:42,832
This doesn't make sense.

1578
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:45,837
Accordingly...

1579
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:47,913
...I offer a resolution...

1580
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:51,279
...an inquiry by the Committee
of Privileges and Elections...

1581
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:52,953
...as to the fitness
of my colleague...

1582
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:55,054
...to continue to
sit in this chamber.

1583
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:02,930
Order!

1584
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:06,825
Chairman, clear the galleries
unless order is restored.

1585
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,101
Flash! Ranger senator
branded by colleague.

1586
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:16,641
Flash! Paine brings charges
to expel Smith.

1587
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,938
Where's Saunders?
-She'll have the lowdown.

1588
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,980
I wish I knew. She left town
in that jalopy of hers.

1589
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:26,981
Paine accuses Smith of introducing
a boys' camp built for his own profit.

1590
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,018
Give me a cigarette.

1591
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:31,021
Paine's asked for a hearing
before the Committee.

1592
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,123
Well, frankly, my dear senators...

1593
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:39,198
...the morning that Mr. Allen
burst into my office...

1594
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,131
...bringing proof that Smith
had the deed to that campsite...

1595
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:44,566
...I was dumbfounded!

1596
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:48,469
Pardon me, what did you do when
this was brought to your attention?

1597
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:51,543
I consulted with the head
of the Department of Records...

1598
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,179
...Mr. Arthur Kim.

1599
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:56,482
Mr. Kim, do you remember
recording such a deed?

1600
01:25:57,952 --> 01:26:01,012
On the date set forth here,
Mr. Allen came before me...

1601
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:02,587
...to record this deed...

1602
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:05,884
...setting over 200 acres
in the name of Jefferson Smith.

1603
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:09,128
How long have you known
Senator Smith, Mr. Allen?

1604
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,127
Oh, a good many years.

1605
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:15,564
He used my land by Willet Creek
every summer for his Boy Rangers.

1606
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:17,362
Seemed like a mighty nice fellow.

1607
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,130
One day he made a proposition.

1608
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:22,741
Said he had a chance to sell that land
for at least $500 an acre.

1609
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:26,471
I'd be glad to get 25 for it.
So we set it up like this:

1610
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:29,445
I deeded him the land, and he gave me a
contract...

1611
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:32,245
...guaranteeing me half,
if he made the sale.

1612
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:33,681
Mind you now...

1613
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,981
...the whole thing
sounded fishy at the time.

1614
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,523
That contract you mentioned...

1615
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:39,658
...have you got it?

1616
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,295
That land wouldn't be
in his name if I didn't.

1617
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,488
Yes, sir.
Signed and delivered.

1618
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,690
I never signed any such contract!

1619
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:47,925
He certainly did!

1620
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:49,603
Just a moment, please.

1621
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:57,670
After a long study of this signature,
it is my professional opinion...

1622
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:01,576
...that it is definitely in
Jefferson Smith's own handwriting.

1623
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,683
As an expert on handwriting...

1624
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:08,322
...I'd say the name of Jefferson
Smith on this contract has been forged.

1625
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:12,425
I would stake my whole 20 years
professional career...

1626
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:15,858
...on the fact that
this is not a forgery...

1627
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:19,693
...but is Mr. Smith's own signature.

1628
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,129
This is a very painful
duty for me.

1629
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,362
This boy's the son
of my very best friend.

1630
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,507
I sponsored him in the Senate.
I helped frame his bill.

1631
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:30,303
When he presented it,
I went to congratulate him...

1632
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:32,911
...but pointed out
a dam was already going up...

1633
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,639
...on the very site
he'd chosen for his camp.

1634
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,444
There are other
good campsites nearby...

1635
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:40,587
...so I suggested he choose another.

1636
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:42,150
He became furious.

1637
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:44,086
He said, "Move the dam."

1638
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:47,284
I was amazed at his violent reaction.
I couldn't understand.

1639
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:51,522
Until the evidence came to me that
he owned those very 200 acres.

1640
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:52,757
And as you have heard...

1641
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:56,232
...had carefully laid plans
to make an enormous profit...

1642
01:27:56,437 --> 01:28:01,306
...out of the nickels and dimes scraped
together by the boys of this country.

1643
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,769
Faced with that...

1644
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,676
...regardless of my
personal feelings for the boy...

1645
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:10,510
...my sense of duty told me his
expulsion from the Senate...

1646
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:12,549
...was the only possible answer.

1647
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,779
Beautiful, that Taylor machine.

1648
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:20,854
Senator Smith, please.

1649
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,456
Will you take the chair, please?

1650
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:41,638
The Committee is ready
to hear you now, Senator Smith.

1651
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,315
Keep your seats, gentlemen!

1652
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:53,550
Committee is not adjourned yet.

1653
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:55,626
Quiet! Please!

1654
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,998
That Ranger never knew what struck
him when Jim Taylor opened up on him.

1655
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:05,297
Which one of you girls wants this?

1656
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,701
-Do you want it?
-Oh, yes.

1657
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:53,636
You know, I had a hunch
I'd find you here...

1658
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:55,406
...when you weren't anyplace else.

1659
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:00,784
How've you been, Saunders?

1660
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:02,182
Oh, all right.

1661
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,952
Your husband.
How's he?

1662
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:08,729
Old Diz.
We're not married.

1663
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:17,905
Good thing I got back just when I did.
You know what I found waiting for me?

1664
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,540
Jar of preserves from your mother.

1665
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:21,799
Oh, you did?

1666
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:24,969
What was it, strawberry?

1667
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:27,974
That's the best kind.

1668
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:33,320
I see by the papers
you certainly got to be a senator.

1669
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:38,087
You sure had the right idea
about me, Saunders.

1670
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:42,353
You told me to go back home and
keep filling those kids full of hooey.

1671
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:47,331
Just a simple guy, you said,
still wet behind the ears...

1672
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,765
...Iot of junk about American ideals.

1673
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:53,034
That's certainly
a lot of junk, all right.

1674
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:56,142
-Now look, senator--
-I don't know...

1675
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,808
...this is a whole new world to me.

1676
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:02,946
What are you going to believe in...

1677
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:07,510
...when a man like Senator Joseph Paine
gets up and swears...

1678
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:11,180
...that I've been robbing
kids of nickels and dimes?

1679
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:15,185
A man I've admired
and worshiped all my life.

1680
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:16,624
I don't know.

1681
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:18,925
A lot of fancy words in this town.

1682
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:21,931
Some of them are carved in stone,
some of them....

1683
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:26,402
Guess the Taylors and Paines put them up
there so suckers like me can read them.

1684
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:29,838
Then when you find out
what men actually do....

1685
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,938
Well, I'm getting out
of this town so fast...

1686
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:37,015
...away from all the words and the
monuments and the whole rotten show.

1687
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,078
I see.

1688
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:43,013
When you get home,
what will you tell those kids?

1689
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:45,459
Well, I'll tell them the truth.

1690
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,185
Might as well find it out
now as later.

1691
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:51,760
I don't think they'll believe you.

1692
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:55,924
They're liable to look up at you
with hurt faces and say...

1693
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,401
..."Jeff, what did you do? Quit?

1694
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,301
Didn't you do something about it?"

1695
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:03,105
Well, what do you expect me to do?

1696
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:05,845
An honorary stooge
like me against...

1697
01:33:06,047 --> 01:33:09,710
...the Taylors and Paines
and machines and lies.

1698
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:13,052
Your friend Mr. Lincoln
had his Taylors and Paines.

1699
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:17,122
So did every other man who tried
to lift his thought up off the ground.

1700
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:20,852
Odds against them didn't stop them,
they were fools that way.

1701
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:23,189
All the good that ever came
into this world...

1702
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:26,161
...came from fools with faith
like that. You know that.

1703
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:29,897
You can't quit now. Not you.

1704
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:32,501
They aren't all Taylors and Paines
in Washington.

1705
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:35,835
That kind just throw big shadows,
that's all.

1706
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:39,973
You didn't just have faith in Paine,
or any other living man.

1707
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:42,308
You had faith in something bigger.

1708
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:46,350
You had plain, decent,
everyday common rightness...

1709
01:33:46,554 --> 01:33:49,387
...and this country
could use some of that.

1710
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:53,649
So could the whole cockeyed world.
A lot of it.

1711
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,426
Remember the first day
you got here?

1712
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,360
Remember what you said
about Mr. Lincoln?

1713
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:01,535
That he was waiting for
someone to come along?

1714
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:02,668
You were right.

1715
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:07,273
He was waiting for a man who could
see his job and sail into it.

1716
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:11,138
Who could tear into the Taylors
and root them out into the open.

1717
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:13,609
I think he was waiting for you.

1718
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:16,214
He knows you can do it.
So do l.

1719
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,682
What?
Do what, Saunders?

1720
01:34:18,886 --> 01:34:22,185
You make up your mind you won't quit,
and I'll tell you what.

1721
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,756
Been thinking about it
all the way back here.

1722
01:34:24,959 --> 01:34:29,293
It's a 40-foot dive into a tub of water,
but I think you can do it.

1723
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:37,434
Clarissa...

1724
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,038
...where can we get a drink?

1725
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:41,230
Now you're talking.

1726
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:43,374
Come on over to my place.

1727
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,320
Mr. Dearborn.

1728
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:59,056
Mr. Dernell.

1729
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:00,825
Mr. Dwight.

1730
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:03,329
They're going to
expel Smith today, eh?

1731
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,897
Where are the drums?
Where's the guillotine?

1732
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,192
In fact, where's Smith?

1733
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,995
Hasn't stopped running
since he left the Committee.

1734
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:11,262
-Mr. Singleton.
-Here.

1735
01:35:11,472 --> 01:35:12,302
Mr. Smith.

1736
01:35:12,506 --> 01:35:13,530
Here!

1737
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:23,510
That guy's batty.

1738
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:26,186
The clerk will continue
with the roll call.

1739
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:29,919
Here comes Saunders.

1740
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,429
Is this some of your shenanigan?

1741
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,030
What's the matter?

1742
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,895
Pray, Diz,
if you know how.

1743
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:45,636
Did you have anything to do with
bringing him in here?

1744
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:47,396
Are you crazy?

1745
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:52,508
Ninety senators have answered
to their names.

1746
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:53,941
Quorum is present.

1747
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:56,313
Proceeding now to the regular order.

1748
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:09,394
Mr. President.

1749
01:36:09,663 --> 01:36:11,221
Senator MacPherson.

1750
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:15,027
I desire to call up the report
of the Committee...

1751
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:18,228
...on the expulsion
of Jefferson Smith.

1752
01:36:21,475 --> 01:36:23,204
Clerk will read the report.

1753
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,079
"The Committee on Privileges
and Elections reports...

1754
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,840
...it appears to the satisfaction
of the Committee...

1755
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,040
...after hearing
a number of witnesses...

1756
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:33,482
...that justice
requires that Smith...

1757
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:35,848
...no longer continue
a member of this body.

1758
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:40,086
They report this resolution with
recommendation that the same do pass.

1759
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:44,593
Resolved: That Jefferson Smith be
expelled from his seat in the Senate."

1760
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:54,800
I move for the immediate
adoption of the resolution.

1761
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,171
-I addressed the chair first.
-I have the floor.

1762
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,313
I'm asking for
a roll call on the passage...

1763
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:02,345
...of the resolution
without further delay.

1764
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:05,417
The senator can have
nothing to say that would not--

1765
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:10,286
However, Senator Smith
is still a member of this body...

1766
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:13,722
...and has an equal claim
on the attention of this chair.

1767
01:37:13,928 --> 01:37:15,225
You were about to recognize me.

1768
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:17,226
That was merely your impression.

1769
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:18,796
Let him speak!

1770
01:37:23,704 --> 01:37:25,569
Before proceeding further...

1771
01:37:25,773 --> 01:37:30,039
...I remind the visitors in the gallery
they are here as our guests...

1772
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:32,075
...and should conduct
themselves as such.

1773
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:35,306
And I might add that their sentiments
in no way will affect...

1774
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:37,814
...the judgement of this chair.

1775
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:45,117
The chair recognizes...

1776
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:48,525
...Senator Smith.

1777
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:52,230
Thank you, sir.

1778
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:53,695
Diz, here we go.

1779
01:37:54,268 --> 01:37:58,102
I guess the gentlemen are
in a big hurry to get me out of here.

1780
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:01,732
The way the evidence is piled up
against me, I can't blame them much.

1781
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:04,911
And I'm willing to go
when they vote it that way...

1782
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:08,104
...but before that happens,
I've got a few things to say.

1783
01:38:08,282 --> 01:38:11,410
I tried to say them once before and l
got stopped colder than a mackerel.

1784
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:13,519
I'd like to get them said
this time.

1785
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,315
I'm not going to leave
until I do get them said.

1786
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:18,047
Will the senator yield?

1787
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:20,921
-Senator yields?
-No, sir, I'm afraid not!

1788
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:22,788
No, sir.

1789
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:27,064
I yielded the floor once before, and
I was practically never heard of again.

1790
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:28,594
No, sir.

1791
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:32,299
And we might as well all get together
on this "yielding" business...

1792
01:38:32,506 --> 01:38:33,530
...right off the bat now.

1793
01:38:37,177 --> 01:38:39,236
I had some pretty good
coaching last night...

1794
01:38:39,446 --> 01:38:41,380
...and I find that if l
yield only for a question...

1795
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:43,812
...or point of order or personal
privilege, that I can...

1796
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:46,543
...hold this floor
almost until doomsday.

1797
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:48,981
In other words, I've got
a piece to speak...

1798
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:50,918
...and blow hot or cold,
I'm going to speak it.

1799
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:52,183
Will the senator yield?

1800
01:38:52,393 --> 01:38:54,088
Will Senator Smith yield?
-Yield how?

1801
01:38:54,295 --> 01:38:56,263
Will he yield for a question?
-All right.

1802
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:58,397
I wish to ask my junior colleague...

1803
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:00,191
...this piece he intends to speak...

1804
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,268
...does it concern Section 40 of
that bill, the dam on Willet Creek?

1805
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:06,132
Every aspect of this matter,
everything...

1806
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,898
...was dealt with
in committee hearings.

1807
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:10,975
-Mr. President?
-I ask my distinguished colleague...

1808
01:39:11,178 --> 01:39:12,907
...has he one scrap
of evidence to add now...

1809
01:39:13,113 --> 01:39:15,479
...to the defense he did not give and
could not give at that same hearing?

1810
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:17,480
I have no defense
against forged papers!

1811
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:18,811
The committee ruled otherwise!

1812
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:22,278
The gentleman
stands guilty as charged.

1813
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:24,519
And I believe I speak
for every member...

1814
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:28,252
...when I say that no one cares to hear
what a man of his condemned character...

1815
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:31,954
...has to say about any section
of any legislation before this House!

1816
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:34,396
-Order, order, gentleman!
-Mr. President...

1817
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:38,230
...I stand guilty as framed because
Section 40 is graft.

1818
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:41,235
And I was ready to say so.
I was ready to tell you...

1819
01:39:41,442 --> 01:39:43,842
...that a certain man in my state,
Mr. James Taylor...

1820
01:39:44,044 --> 01:39:46,205
...wanted to put through this dam
for his own profit.

1821
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:49,473
A man who controls
a political machine...

1822
01:39:49,683 --> 01:39:52,174
...and controls everything else
in my state.

1823
01:39:52,386 --> 01:39:54,877
A man even powerful enough
to control congressmen.

1824
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:57,580
I saw three of them in his room
the day I went to see him.

1825
01:39:57,791 --> 01:40:00,055
Will the senator yield?
-I will not yield!

1826
01:40:03,764 --> 01:40:05,994
This same man,
James Taylor, came down here...

1827
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,600
...and offered me a seat
in this Senate for the next 20 years...

1828
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:12,835
...if I voted for a dam that he knew
and I knew was a fraud...

1829
01:40:13,107 --> 01:40:15,507
...but if I dared to open
my mouth against that dam...

1830
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:17,199
...he promised to break me in two.

1831
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:20,175
I got up here and
I started to open my mouth...

1832
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:22,781
...and the long and powerful arm
of Mr. Taylor...

1833
01:40:22,983 --> 01:40:26,578
...reached into this sacred chamber and
grabbed me by the scruff of the neck--

1834
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:28,015
Mr. President, a point of order.

1835
01:40:28,222 --> 01:40:29,154
Mr. President?

1836
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:30,721
Senator Paine will state it.

1837
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:33,286
It was I who rose in this
chamber to accuse him.

1838
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:36,122
He's saying that I was carrying out
criminal orders on falsified evidence.

1839
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:39,356
He has imputed to me conduct
unworthy a senator, and I demand...

1840
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:41,364
...that he yield the floor.

1841
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:44,560
I did not say that Senator Paine was
one of the congressmen in that room!

1842
01:40:44,772 --> 01:40:45,761
I was in that room!

1843
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,407
Order, gentlemen.

1844
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:52,842
I accuse this man.

1845
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,481
By his tone, by his careful
denials...

1846
01:40:55,682 --> 01:40:58,879
...he is trying to plant
damaging impressions on my conduct.

1847
01:40:59,153 --> 01:41:01,144
I'll tell you why
we were in that room.

1848
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:04,449
Because Mr. Taylor, a respected
citizen of our state...

1849
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:06,592
...had brought with him
the evidence against this man...

1850
01:41:06,794 --> 01:41:08,625
...and we were urging him to resign.

1851
01:41:08,829 --> 01:41:12,595
Why? To avoid bringing disgrace
upon a clean and honorable state.

1852
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,131
But he refused!

1853
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:15,198
Mr. President--

1854
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:17,529
There is only one answer
to a man like him.

1855
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:20,730
The truth, which I rose and gave
to this body.

1856
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:23,206
Mr. President...

1857
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:26,379
...he is trying to blackmail this
Senate as he tried to blackmail me.

1858
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,480
To prevent his expulsion, he'll
even try to...

1859
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:31,276
...hold up this Deficiency Bill,
vital to the country...

1860
01:41:31,485 --> 01:41:33,453
...which must be passed
immediately!

1861
01:41:33,654 --> 01:41:35,246
Have I the floor?

1862
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:38,582
I have lost all patience
with this brazen character.

1863
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:41,386
I apologize to this body
for his appointment.

1864
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:43,593
I regret I ever knew him.
I'm sick...

1865
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:45,094
...of this contemptible young man.

1866
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:48,564
And I refuse to stay here
and listen to him any longer.

1867
01:41:48,836 --> 01:41:51,532
I hope every member
of this body feels as I do.

1868
01:41:51,738 --> 01:41:53,899
Get off the floor! Yield the floor!

1869
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:56,936
Gentlemen!

1870
01:41:57,144 --> 01:42:00,045
Gentlemen, please address the chair!

1871
01:42:00,314 --> 01:42:03,044
Mr. President, what does
the gentleman want of this body?

1872
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,444
I'll tell you, sir!

1873
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:07,119
I want a chance to talk to people
who'll believe me.

1874
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:10,017
The people of my state, they know me
and they know Mr. Taylor.

1875
01:42:10,224 --> 01:42:12,124
When they hear my story,
they'll rise up...

1876
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:14,954
...and kick Taylor's machine
to kingdom come.

1877
01:42:15,162 --> 01:42:17,653
I want one week to go back there
and bring you proof.

1878
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:20,197
In the meantime, I want
this Senate's promise...

1879
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,130
...that I won't be expelled and
this bill will not be passed.

1880
01:42:23,337 --> 01:42:25,066
Will the senator yield?
-For a question.

1881
01:42:25,272 --> 01:42:28,901
Has the gentleman the effrontery to
stand, convicted and in disgrace...

1882
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:31,441
...and try to force postponement
of the Deficiency Bill?

1883
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:33,237
-For one week.
-Mr. President!

1884
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:35,108
I appeal to the senator.

1885
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:38,614
Is he fully aware that this bill
has been months in both Houses...

1886
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,480
...delayed and delayed?

1887
01:42:40,687 --> 01:42:42,621
Millions will be
without food and shelter.

1888
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:44,950
Public works will be
at a standstill!

1889
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,421
Will we keep
relief from the country?

1890
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:48,060
The people of my state
need permanent relief...

1891
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:49,889
...from crooked men riding their backs!

1892
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:51,792
Mr. President, if the Senate yields...

1893
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,900
...to this sort to blackmail,
it'll become a laughingstock.

1894
01:42:55,102 --> 01:42:57,297
It is an insult to this body
to have to listen.

1895
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:59,699
An insult to our colleague,
Senator Paine.

1896
01:42:59,907 --> 01:43:01,875
I, for one, will follow
the senator's example...

1897
01:43:02,075 --> 01:43:05,977
...and refuse to remain in this chamber
as long as that man holds the floor!

1898
01:43:16,757 --> 01:43:18,281
Order, gentlemen!

1899
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:23,355
I guess I'll have to speak to
the people of my state from right here!

1900
01:43:24,932 --> 01:43:25,956
I'll tell you...

1901
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:28,532
...wild horses won't drag me
off this floor until those...

1902
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:32,034
...people have heard everything I've
got to say, if it takes all winter!

1903
01:43:38,245 --> 01:43:39,872
Filibuster!

1904
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:56,385
Well, Mr. President,
we seem to be alone.

1905
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:01,932
I'm not complaining
for social reason, it's just....

1906
01:44:02,135 --> 01:44:06,299
I think it'd be a pity if these
gentlemen missed any of this. And....

1907
01:44:20,954 --> 01:44:23,787
I call the chair's attention to...

1908
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,384
...to Rule Five...

1909
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,289
...of the Standing Rules of the Senate.

1910
01:44:29,496 --> 01:44:31,327
Section...Section Three.

1911
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:34,433
"lf it shall be found that
a quorum is not present...

1912
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:37,229
...a majority of
the senators present--"

1913
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:39,530
And that looks like me.

1914
01:44:42,576 --> 01:44:45,943
"--may direct the sergeant at
arms to request, and if necessary...

1915
01:44:46,146 --> 01:44:49,115
...compel the attendance
of the absent senators."

1916
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:52,248
Well, Mr. President, I so direct.

1917
01:44:56,923 --> 01:44:59,949
The absence of a
quorum being suggested.

1918
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,388
-Bring the call to quorum.
-Call to quorum.

1919
01:45:04,665 --> 01:45:07,691
There's no hurry, Mr. President.
I got plenty of time.

1920
01:45:12,005 --> 01:45:14,633
Quorum call! Call to quorum!

1921
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:24,249
All senators wanted on the floor!

1922
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:29,154
Clerk will call the roll.

1923
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:31,347
-Mr. Agnew.
-Here.

1924
01:45:31,558 --> 01:45:33,048
Mr. Albert.

1925
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:34,386
Mr. Alfred.

1926
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:36,152
-Mr. Ashman.
-Here.

1927
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:40,257
Joe, get this! Smith got the
floor and is holding it.

1928
01:45:40,467 --> 01:45:41,832
Just as they were
about to kick him out!

1929
01:45:42,035 --> 01:45:43,593
He did it, Diz. It's wonderful!

1930
01:45:43,804 --> 01:45:45,237
It was terrific!

1931
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:48,670
A filibuster! This is the miracle l
wanted. What a yarn!

1932
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:51,002
Get everything
he says back to that home state.

1933
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:52,178
It's a pleasure!

1934
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:54,370
They're going
to hear this in Patagonia.

1935
01:45:54,581 --> 01:45:57,209
In protest,
the whole Senate body walked out!

1936
01:45:57,417 --> 01:45:59,214
Not that straight stuff.
Kick it up.

1937
01:45:59,419 --> 01:46:01,410
Get on his side.
Fight for him, understand?

1938
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:03,020
You love this monkey, don't you?

1939
01:46:03,223 --> 01:46:06,317
What do you think? Now
go to work. Do as I tell you.

1940
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:09,493
Take this: This is the most
titanic battle of modern times.

1941
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:12,164
A David without even a slingshot
rises to battle...

1942
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,357
...against the mighty Goliath,
the Taylor machine...

1943
01:46:14,568 --> 01:46:17,196
...allegedly crooked inside and out.

1944
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:19,700
For my money
you can drop the "allegedly."

1945
01:46:19,906 --> 01:46:21,430
We're bringing everybody up
from headquarters.

1946
01:46:21,641 --> 01:46:24,474
Where are they? Come on,
get these telegraphs moving!

1947
01:46:26,413 --> 01:46:27,971
-You get Hendricks?
-They're looking for him.

1948
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:29,808
"They're looking for him." An editor.

1949
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,779
Why isn't he at his desk,
where he belongs?

1950
01:46:31,985 --> 01:46:34,146
Don't you think you
better get back to that Senate?

1951
01:46:34,354 --> 01:46:36,151
The boy's talking to that state.

1952
01:46:36,356 --> 01:46:38,483
If he can raise public opinion
against us--

1953
01:46:38,692 --> 01:46:40,557
He'll never get started.

1954
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:44,197
I'll make public opinion within 5 hours.
I've done it all my life.

1955
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:46,366
I'll blacken this punk so....

1956
01:46:46,967 --> 01:46:48,434
Leave public opinion to me.

1957
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:50,068
Now, go back into the Senate...

1958
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,204
...and keep those senators lined up.

1959
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:55,102
I hit him from the floor
with everything I knew.

1960
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:58,635
I haven't got
the stomach for it anymore.

1961
01:46:58,845 --> 01:47:03,407
If he convinces those senators,
you might as well blow your brains out.

1962
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:04,709
This is the works, Joe!

1963
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:07,409
Either we're out of business or
we're bigger than ever.

1964
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:11,557
We can't stop at anything until
we smash this yokel--

1965
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:12,622
Hendricks on the phone.

1966
01:47:12,826 --> 01:47:14,225
Go back to the Senate,
will you?

1967
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,988
Hello, Hendricks.
Well, the chips are down.

1968
01:47:17,197 --> 01:47:20,963
Keep everything that Smith says,
or any other pro-Smith stuff...

1969
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:23,398
...out of all our newspapers.
Understand?

1970
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:26,197
And all the others
you can line up in the state.

1971
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:31,343
Those broken-down opposition papers,
who won't play ball with us...

1972
01:47:31,545 --> 01:47:34,207
...I want you to tie up for 24 hours.

1973
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:38,417
Stall their deliveries. Push them off
the street. I don't care!

1974
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:41,018
Bury them for 24 hours.
That'll give me plenty of time.

1975
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:44,190
And you defend the machine.
Hit this guy!

1976
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:47,656
The usual thing. Criminal, and
blocking a relief bill...

1977
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:49,351
...and starving the people.

1978
01:47:49,563 --> 01:47:51,793
Joe, will you get back
into that Senate?

1979
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:56,659
And Hendricks,
get the hoi polloi excited.

1980
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:59,896
Have them send protest letters,
wires, anything you like.

1981
01:48:00,106 --> 01:48:03,200
Buy every minute you can
of every radio station in the state...

1982
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:05,310
...and keep them
spouting against Smith.

1983
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:07,275
I don't care what it costs.
Pay out.

1984
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,210
Get moving.
Get the whole state moving!

1985
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:17,756
This filibuster is a cowardly attempt
to turn your attention...

1986
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:20,620
...from the true facts which
are beyond question.

1987
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:23,819
Jefferson Smith was caught
red-handed, stealing from boys.

1988
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:26,590
Relief will be stopped.
Men thrown out of jobs.

1989
01:48:36,843 --> 01:48:40,006
-I've seen filibustering, but--
-Smith can't go on. It's ridiculous.

1990
01:48:40,213 --> 01:48:42,204
We've got to get
him off the floor.

1991
01:48:42,415 --> 01:48:45,748
As long as Mr. Smith holds that
floor legitimately...

1992
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,920
...he's going to continue to hold it.

1993
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:50,555
If you ask me,
that fellow's making sense.

1994
01:48:50,757 --> 01:48:53,453
Sense? You call
blackmail sense, Henry?

1995
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:56,254
Joe, I didn't like
this boy from the beginning.

1996
01:48:56,463 --> 01:48:58,226
But we feel that
no man who wasn't sincere...

1997
01:48:58,431 --> 01:49:00,490
...could fight like this
against these odds.

1998
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,531
I'm very glad
to know that, Martin.

1999
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:06,433
After 20 years, I'm very glad to know
you'd take his word against mine.

2000
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,335
Yes, that's what it means!

2001
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:10,533
If he's that much right,
then I'm wrong.

2002
01:49:10,744 --> 01:49:13,110
Joe, can't we
work out some deal...

2003
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:16,476
...to pull that Willet Dam out and
let the Deficiency Bill go through?

2004
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:18,378
It isn't a question of Willet Dam.

2005
01:49:18,585 --> 01:49:20,815
It's a question of my honor
and reputation.

2006
01:49:21,021 --> 01:49:25,321
The integrity of the Committee,
the integrity of the Senate itself.

2007
01:49:25,525 --> 01:49:27,322
If you want to throw out
Section 40, go ahead.

2008
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:30,519
-I'll resign.
-Now, wait a minute, Joe.

2009
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:32,493
This is a lot of nonsense.

2010
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:35,167
Joe's right. A deal is impossible.

2011
01:49:35,368 --> 01:49:36,801
We've got to go on with this.

2012
01:49:37,003 --> 01:49:38,937
Break him, keep him talking.

2013
01:49:39,139 --> 01:49:42,267
No relief.
Maintain a quorum in relays.

2014
01:49:42,475 --> 01:49:44,705
-ls that how you feel, John?
-For once, I agree with you.

2015
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:46,572
It's time to relieve
the floor.

2016
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:49,681
How a man that green
knows as much as he does....

2017
01:49:49,883 --> 01:49:50,907
Can't go on much longer.

2018
01:49:51,117 --> 01:49:52,584
"--that they're entitled
by their creator...

2019
01:49:52,786 --> 01:49:54,549
...with certain inalienable rights...

2020
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:57,723
...and that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of--"

2021
01:50:00,827 --> 01:50:03,227
Well, looks like
the night shift's coming on.

2022
01:50:06,232 --> 01:50:09,668
Senator will please suspend until
order is restored.

2023
01:50:17,677 --> 01:50:19,235
This is H.V. Coltenborn speaking.

2024
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:22,279
Half of official Washington is here
to see democracy's finest show...

2025
01:50:22,482 --> 01:50:25,280
...the filibuster: The right
to talk your head off.

2026
01:50:25,485 --> 01:50:28,579
The American privilege of free speech
in its most dramatic form.

2027
01:50:28,788 --> 01:50:30,756
The least man in that chamber...

2028
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:33,391
...once he gets and holds that floor,
by the rules...

2029
01:50:33,593 --> 01:50:36,585
...can hold it and talk as long
as he can stand on his feet.

2030
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:39,629
Providing always
that he does not sit down...

2031
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:42,996
...and that he does not leave the
chamber or stop talking.

2032
01:50:43,203 --> 01:50:44,500
The galleries are packed.

2033
01:50:44,704 --> 01:50:48,140
In the diplomatic gallery are the
envoys of two dictator powers.

2034
01:50:48,341 --> 01:50:50,969
They have come here to see
what they can't see at home...

2035
01:50:51,177 --> 01:50:52,610
...democracy in action.

2036
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:55,672
"--life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness...

2037
01:50:55,882 --> 01:50:59,147
...and to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men...

2038
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:02,253
...deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed...

2039
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:06,289
...that whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to these ends...

2040
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:10,122
...it is the right of the people
to alter or abolish it."

2041
01:51:10,563 --> 01:51:11,894
How am I doing?

2042
01:51:15,168 --> 01:51:17,659
-Quit stalling and move!
-Clark, Jim.

2043
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:19,528
-Oh, Clark--
-Mr. Taylor?

2044
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:20,967
Yes, wait a minute

2045
01:51:21,408 --> 01:51:22,773
Phone Senator Paine about it.

2046
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:24,807
This is
Jim Taylor in Washington.

2047
01:51:25,011 --> 01:51:26,205
About this Smith filibuster.

2048
01:51:26,413 --> 01:51:28,745
Newspapers
in the Southwest must realize...

2049
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:30,540
...that this bill
he's trying to block...

2050
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:32,240
...will affect your section
as well as any.

2051
01:51:32,452 --> 01:51:34,249
It's the patriotic duty of every
newspaper--

2052
01:51:34,454 --> 01:51:35,785
Wait a minute. Yes?

2053
01:51:35,989 --> 01:51:37,547
-Jackson City calling.
-Hold them!

2054
01:51:37,757 --> 01:51:39,725
We've got to keep hammering
at this man until we smash him!

2055
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:44,558
I get a great kick out of that part
of the Declaration of lndependence.

2056
01:51:45,098 --> 01:51:48,659
You're not going to have a country
that can make these rules work...

2057
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:51,359
...if you haven't got men that have
learned to tell human rights...

2058
01:51:51,571 --> 01:51:52,765
...from a punch in the nose.

2059
01:51:57,944 --> 01:51:59,502
That's good for a headline.

2060
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:02,079
It's a funny thing about men,
you know.

2061
01:52:02,282 --> 01:52:04,182
They all start life being boys...

2062
01:52:05,785 --> 01:52:08,413
...I wouldn't be surprised if
these senators were boys once.

2063
01:52:08,621 --> 01:52:10,851
That's why it seemed
like a good idea...

2064
01:52:11,057 --> 01:52:12,718
...to get the boys out
of crowded cities...

2065
01:52:12,926 --> 01:52:15,759
...and stuffy basements for a
couple of months out of the year...

2066
01:52:15,962 --> 01:52:18,487
...and build their bodies
and minds for a man-sized job...

2067
01:52:18,698 --> 01:52:21,394
...because they're going to be
behind these desks someday.

2068
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:25,663
It seemed like a good idea, getting
boys from all over the country...

2069
01:52:25,872 --> 01:52:29,330
...boys of all nationalities and
ways of living.

2070
01:52:29,542 --> 01:52:30,440
Getting them together...

2071
01:52:31,077 --> 01:52:34,069
...Iet them find out what makes
different people tick.

2072
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:37,374
Because I wouldn't give you 2 cents
for all your rules...

2073
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:41,987
...if behind them they didn't have a
little ordinary everyday kindness...

2074
01:52:42,188 --> 01:52:45,954
...and a little looking out
for the other fellow too.

2075
01:52:54,267 --> 01:52:56,701
That's pretty important, all that.

2076
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:01,305
It's just the blood and bone
and sinew of this democracy...

2077
01:53:01,508 --> 01:53:04,341
...that some great men handed down
to the human race, that's all!

2078
01:53:04,544 --> 01:53:07,980
But if you've got to build a dam
where that boys' camp ought to be...

2079
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:12,379
...to pay off some political army,
that's a different thing. Oh, no!

2080
01:53:12,852 --> 01:53:16,015
If you think I'm going back and
tell those boys in my state...

2081
01:53:16,222 --> 01:53:18,087
..."Fellows,
forget about it.

2082
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:22,193
All I've been telling you about the
land you live in is a lot of hooey.

2083
01:53:22,395 --> 01:53:26,627
This isn't your country. It belongs to
a lot of James Taylors." No, not me.

2084
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:29,529
Anybody here that thinks I'd do that,
they got another thing coming!

2085
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:42,376
I just wanted to
find out if you still had faces.

2086
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:51,419
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

2087
01:53:52,826 --> 01:53:56,557
I know I'm being disrespectful to
this honorable body.

2088
01:53:57,030 --> 01:54:01,364
A guy like me should never be allowed
to get in here in the first place.

2089
01:54:01,568 --> 01:54:05,902
And I hate to stand here and
try your patience like this, but l--

2090
01:54:06,105 --> 01:54:08,665
Either I'm dead right or I'm crazy!

2091
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:11,969
You wouldn't care to put that
to a vote, would you, senator?

2092
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:17,207
Will the senator yield for a question?
-I yield.

2093
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:20,147
In view of the gentlemen's touching
concern for the senators...

2094
01:54:20,353 --> 01:54:23,117
...and the fact that he's been
talking for 7 1/2 hours...

2095
01:54:23,323 --> 01:54:25,587
...and must be very, very tired...

2096
01:54:25,792 --> 01:54:28,386
...would he permit a motion to recess
until the morning...

2097
01:54:28,595 --> 01:54:32,759
...at which time he may better continue
with his profound babblings.

2098
01:54:32,966 --> 01:54:34,365
No. No, don't!

2099
01:54:38,037 --> 01:54:38,867
Ask him!

2100
01:54:46,913 --> 01:54:49,404
Mr. President, what happens
in the morning...

2101
01:54:49,616 --> 01:54:51,049
...I mean, about my...

2102
01:54:51,251 --> 01:54:54,414
...having this floor to
go on with my "babblings"?

2103
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:57,590
If the senator permits
this motion for a recess...

2104
01:54:57,790 --> 01:54:59,223
...he won't have the floor
in the morning...

2105
01:54:59,425 --> 01:55:01,086
...to babble with or anything else...

2106
01:55:01,628 --> 01:55:05,086
...unless he is recognized first
by this chair.

2107
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:14,965
As I was saying, gentlemen...

2108
01:55:15,808 --> 01:55:17,776
...I'm either dead right
or I'm crazy...

2109
01:55:17,977 --> 01:55:19,911
...and I feel fine.

2110
01:55:20,113 --> 01:55:22,843
What have you got, Dick?
-From Miss Saunders.

2111
01:55:49,142 --> 01:55:50,632
Is the senator yielding the floor?

2112
01:55:53,479 --> 01:55:55,777
Yield? Oh, no!

2113
01:55:57,183 --> 01:55:58,445
I feel fine!

2114
01:56:01,354 --> 01:56:04,289
The Constitution of the United States.

2115
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:13,393
Page one, top left-hand corner.

2116
01:56:13,967 --> 01:56:15,491
"We the people of the United States...

2117
01:56:15,702 --> 01:56:17,294
...in order to form
a more perfect union...."

2118
01:56:17,503 --> 01:56:19,403
Yeah? Well, buy it or wreck it!

2119
01:56:20,139 --> 01:56:22,437
Brady's column too?
Holy smokes!

2120
01:56:22,642 --> 01:56:23,609
What's the matter?

2121
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:26,108
This is murder,
you got to call him off.

2122
01:56:26,312 --> 01:56:28,246
-He's getting nowhere.
What are you talking about?

2123
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:30,607
Not one word of what he says
is being printed in that state.

2124
01:56:30,883 --> 01:56:31,815
Oh, no!

2125
01:56:32,018 --> 01:56:34,646
Taylor has practically every paper
in the state lined up...

2126
01:56:34,854 --> 01:56:36,515
...and he's feeding them
doctored-up junk!

2127
01:56:36,723 --> 01:56:39,783
-One man muzzling a whole state?
-And how!

2128
01:56:40,026 --> 01:56:42,119
Freedom of the press!

2129
01:56:44,030 --> 01:56:46,225
Wait a minute! I've got an idea!

2130
01:56:47,533 --> 01:56:50,525
Jeff has a paper there,
Boy Stuff, right?

2131
01:56:51,037 --> 01:56:51,867
Terrific!

2132
01:56:52,071 --> 01:56:55,404
They aren't letting what Jeff says
get printed in the state.

2133
01:56:55,608 --> 01:56:57,735
If I give you a raft
over the phone now--

2134
01:56:57,944 --> 01:56:59,707
Write me a front-page raft, Diz.

2135
01:56:59,912 --> 01:57:01,379
Can you print it out...

2136
01:57:01,581 --> 01:57:03,879
...and spread a billion copies of it?

2137
01:57:04,083 --> 01:57:05,482
Swell!

2138
01:57:05,685 --> 01:57:07,516
Get ready to take it down,
will you, Mrs. Smith?

2139
01:57:07,787 --> 01:57:08,754
All right.

2140
01:57:08,955 --> 01:57:11,981
Boys, everything about Jeff.
Get pencils and paper, quick!

2141
01:57:13,593 --> 01:57:14,821
All right, here we go!

2142
01:57:15,194 --> 01:57:16,252
All ready, Clarissa.

2143
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:18,993
She called me Clarissa!

2144
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,564
Okay, Ma!

2145
01:57:22,568 --> 01:57:24,729
"Jeff Tells Truth.

2146
01:57:25,104 --> 01:57:26,264
Shows Up Taylor."

2147
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:29,106
I want the whole morning edition.
Push him off the floor!

2148
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:31,310
Start your campaign
for protests. Wired!

2149
01:57:31,978 --> 01:57:34,913
"Willet Dam is a fraud to
line the pockets of the Taylor machine."

2150
01:57:35,114 --> 01:57:37,207
Here's your front-page editorial.
Wait!

2151
01:57:38,084 --> 01:57:39,176
"A convicted thief representing you...

2152
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:41,410
...holds the floor of
the United States Senate. "

2153
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:43,086
All right, boys. Hurry up!

2154
01:57:43,289 --> 01:57:45,519
She said rush!
Get cracking now!

2155
01:57:54,734 --> 01:57:56,793
Come on!
Bring on the paper!

2156
01:58:35,174 --> 01:58:38,575
"--charity wanteth not itself...

2157
01:58:39,145 --> 01:58:40,578
...is not propped up...

2158
01:58:43,416 --> 01:58:46,408
...and now abideth faith...

2159
01:58:47,286 --> 01:58:49,720
...hope, charity...

2160
01:58:50,156 --> 01:58:51,623
...these three.

2161
01:58:53,659 --> 01:58:56,423
The greatest of these is charity."

2162
01:59:38,804 --> 01:59:39,736
Read about Jeff.

2163
01:59:39,972 --> 01:59:42,497
Boy's Stuff circulars.
Peddled by 9 million kids.

2164
01:59:42,708 --> 01:59:46,007
What are you standing there for?
Get the boys out! Kill it!

2165
02:00:00,059 --> 02:00:02,220
Get these papers out of here.

2166
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,701
Read all about it!
Jeff Smith lies in Senate!

2167
02:00:23,616 --> 02:00:26,210
Wire Congress!

2168
02:00:31,657 --> 02:00:35,252
Are we going to let a man like Jeff
throw mud at a man like Joe Paine?

2169
02:00:37,196 --> 02:00:38,458
Are you for Joe Paine?

2170
02:00:41,968 --> 02:00:43,902
Hurray for Jeff Smith!

2171
02:00:59,385 --> 02:01:01,285
Children hurt all over the city.

2172
02:01:01,487 --> 02:01:02,613
Tell Jeff to stop!

2173
02:01:03,723 --> 02:01:06,089
Yes, all right.

2174
02:01:06,292 --> 02:01:07,520
Goodbye.

2175
02:01:09,428 --> 02:01:12,864
"Senator Smith has now talked
for 23 hours and 1 6 minutes.

2176
02:01:13,032 --> 02:01:15,762
It's the most unusual and spectacular
thing in the Senate annuls.

2177
02:01:15,968 --> 02:01:17,458
One lone and simple American...

2178
02:01:17,670 --> 02:01:19,365
...holding the greatest
floor in the land.

2179
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:22,268
What he lacked in experience,
he's made up in fight.

2180
02:01:22,608 --> 02:01:25,133
But those tired Boy Ranger legs
are buckling.

2181
02:01:25,344 --> 02:01:27,005
Bleary-eyed, voice gone.

2182
02:01:27,213 --> 02:01:30,011
He can't go on much longer.
And all official Washington...

2183
02:01:30,216 --> 02:01:32,047
...is here to be in on the kill."

2184
02:01:33,019 --> 02:01:35,487
There's no compromise with truth.

2185
02:01:35,688 --> 02:01:38,623
That's all I got up
on this floor to say.

2186
02:01:39,225 --> 02:01:40,522
When was it?

2187
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:42,722
A year ago, it seems like.

2188
02:01:42,928 --> 02:01:45,920
Terrible things are happening.
I've got to stop him.

2189
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:47,622
They're listening to him.
Anything might happen now.

2190
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:51,327
Just get up off the ground.
That's all I ask.

2191
02:01:51,537 --> 02:01:54,836
Get up there with that lady
that's on top of this Capitol dome.

2192
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:57,134
That lady that stands for liberty.

2193
02:01:57,977 --> 02:02:01,071
Look at this country through her eyes
if you want to see something.

2194
02:02:02,448 --> 02:02:04,382
But you won't just see scenery.

2195
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:07,484
You'll see the whole parade of what
man's carved out for himself...

2196
02:02:07,687 --> 02:02:09,712
...after centuries of fighting.

2197
02:02:10,189 --> 02:02:12,817
Fighting for something better
than just jungle law.

2198
02:02:13,225 --> 02:02:17,025
Fighting so he can stand on
his own two feet, free and decent...

2199
02:02:17,229 --> 02:02:18,594
...Iike he was created.

2200
02:02:18,798 --> 02:02:21,528
No matter what his race,
color or creed.

2201
02:02:23,869 --> 02:02:25,461
That's what you'd see.

2202
02:02:26,772 --> 02:02:28,933
There's no place
out there for graft...

2203
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:30,972
...or greed or lies...

2204
02:02:31,177 --> 02:02:33,907
...or compromise with human liberties.

2205
02:02:34,113 --> 02:02:37,640
If that's what the grownups
have done with this world...

2206
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:39,681
...we better get those
boys' camps started fast...

2207
02:02:39,885 --> 02:02:41,910
...and see what the kids can do.

2208
02:02:42,788 --> 02:02:44,585
It's not too late.

2209
02:02:45,091 --> 02:02:47,924
Because this country is
bigger than the Taylors...

2210
02:02:48,127 --> 02:02:50,220
...or you or me or anything else!

2211
02:02:52,031 --> 02:02:54,932
Great principles don't get lost once
they come to light.

2212
02:02:55,134 --> 02:02:57,068
They're right here!

2213
02:02:57,303 --> 02:02:59,737
You just have to see them again.

2214
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:04,667
Mr. President.

2215
02:03:05,111 --> 02:03:06,442
Will the senator yield
for a question?

2216
02:03:07,179 --> 02:03:08,942
Will Senator Smith yield
to his colleague?

2217
02:03:09,415 --> 02:03:11,406
Yes, I yield for a question.

2218
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:15,144
The senator has said he is speaking
to the people of his state.

2219
02:03:15,354 --> 02:03:18,346
He has been waiting,
as he so fancifully puts it...

2220
02:03:18,557 --> 02:03:20,991
...for them to come
marching here in droves.

2221
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:24,320
Would the gentlemen be interested
in what those people have to say?

2222
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:26,157
Here it comes.

2223
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:28,094
Yes, sir, you bet I would.

2224
02:03:29,602 --> 02:03:30,569
Mr. President.

2225
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:32,431
Have I permission to bring in...

2226
02:03:32,638 --> 02:03:34,629
...evidence of
the response of my state?

2227
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:36,671
Is there objection?

2228
02:03:37,877 --> 02:03:38,969
You may proceed, senator.

2229
02:03:39,178 --> 02:03:40,543
Pageboys!

2230
02:04:16,048 --> 02:04:19,643
I can't stand it. I can't stand
to see him hurt like this.

2231
02:04:19,852 --> 02:04:21,285
Public opinion made to order.

2232
02:04:21,487 --> 02:04:23,011
Taylor-made.

2233
02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:27,017
There it is.
There's the gentleman's answer.

2234
02:04:27,226 --> 02:04:29,717
Telegrams. 50,000 of them...

2235
02:04:29,929 --> 02:04:31,487
...demanding that he yield this floor.

2236
02:04:31,697 --> 02:04:33,221
I invite the Senate to read them.

2237
02:04:33,466 --> 02:04:35,195
I invite my colleague to read them.

2238
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:38,063
The people's answer to
Mr. Jefferson Smith.

2239
02:05:21,981 --> 02:05:23,881
Stop, Jeff! Stop!

2240
02:06:08,928 --> 02:06:12,420
I guess this is just another
lost cause, Mr. Paine.

2241
02:06:17,636 --> 02:06:20,935
All you people don't know
about lost causes.

2242
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:23,098
Mr. Paine does.

2243
02:06:25,244 --> 02:06:28,771
He said once they were
the only causes worth fighting for.

2244
02:06:29,281 --> 02:06:31,340
He fought for them once.

2245
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:35,445
For the only reason that any man
ever fights for them.

2246
02:06:38,691 --> 02:06:42,092
Because of just one plain, simple rule:

2247
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:44,122
Love thy neighbor.

2248
02:06:45,898 --> 02:06:47,092
In this world today...

2249
02:06:47,299 --> 02:06:48,357
...full of hatred...

2250
02:06:48,567 --> 02:06:51,468
...a man who knows that one rule
has a great trust.

2251
02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:54,298
You know that rule, Mr. Paine.

2252
02:06:54,873 --> 02:06:58,001
And I loved you for it,
just as my father did.

2253
02:06:58,243 --> 02:07:01,679
And you know you fight for lost causes
harder than for any others.

2254
02:07:02,214 --> 02:07:04,444
Yes, you even die for them.

2255
02:07:06,218 --> 02:07:08,812
Like a man we both knew, Mr. Paine.

2256
02:07:12,091 --> 02:07:13,888
You think I'm licked.

2257
02:07:16,128 --> 02:07:17,493
You all think I'm licked!

2258
02:07:19,431 --> 02:07:21,365
Well, I'm not licked!

2259
02:07:21,567 --> 02:07:24,627
I'm going to stay right here
and fight for this lost cause!

2260
02:07:24,837 --> 02:07:28,432
Even if this room gets
filled with lies like these...

2261
02:07:29,274 --> 02:07:33,734
...and the Taylors and all their armies
come marching into this place.

2262
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,075
Somebody will listen to me.

2263
02:08:00,606 --> 02:08:02,574
He's okay. He just fainted.

2264
02:08:14,953 --> 02:08:16,580
-Let me go!
What's the matter, Joe?

2265
02:08:16,789 --> 02:08:19,053
I'm not fit to be a senator!
I'm not fit to live!

2266
02:08:19,258 --> 02:08:20,691
Expel me!

2267
02:08:20,893 --> 02:08:22,019
Expel me, not him!

2268
02:08:22,227 --> 02:08:23,353
Willy Taylor's a fraud!

2269
02:08:23,562 --> 02:08:25,587
It's a crime against
the people who sent me here...

2270
02:08:25,798 --> 02:08:28,392
...and I committed it! Every word
that boy said is the truth!

2271
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:30,659
Every word about Taylor
and me and graft...

2272
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:33,133
...and the rotten political
corruption in my state!

2273
02:08:33,338 --> 02:08:35,863
Every word of it is true!
I'm not fit for office!

2274
02:08:36,075 --> 02:08:38,009
I'm not fit for
any place of honor or trust!

2275
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:39,973
Expel me, not that boy!

2276
02:08:49,288 --> 02:08:51,119
We did it! We did it!

2277
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:57,821
Order gentlemen! Please!

2278
02:09:07,606 --> 02:09:08,595
He did it!

2279
02:09:08,807 --> 02:09:10,502
Let go of me!

2280
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:15,906
Yippee!
