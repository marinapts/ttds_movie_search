1
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:09,513
She isn't coming yet, Toto.
Did she hurt you?

2
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,456
She tried to, didn't she? Come on.
We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

3
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:25,535
Aunt Em! Aunt Em!

4
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:29,465
Aunt Em, just listen
to what Miss Gulch did to Toto!

5
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:32,444
- Dorothy, please! We're trying to count!
- But she hit him...

6
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:35,913
Don't bother us now, honey.
This old incubator's gone bad...

7
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:38,746
...and we're likely to lose
a lot of our chicks.

8
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,116
The poor little things.

9
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:44,813
Miss Gulch hit Toto on the back
with a rake just because she says...

10
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:48,418
...he gets in her garden and chases
her nasty old cat every day!

11
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,062
Dorothy, please!

12
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,293
But he doesn't do it every day,
just once or twice a week.

13
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:57,303
He can't catch her old cat, anyway!
And now she says she's going to...

14
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:59,168
Dorothy! We're busy!

15
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,075
All right.

16
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,742
How's she coming?

17
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,042
Take it easy.

18
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,983
You got my finger!

19
00:03:12,052 --> 00:03:14,282
Why don't you get your finger
out of the way?

20
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:15,777
There you are.

21
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:19,053
- Right on my finger!
- It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

22
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:21,356
Zeke, what am I going to do
about Miss Gulch?

23
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:25,524
- Just because Toto chases her old cat...
- Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

24
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,124
Dorothy, you ain't using your head
about Miss Gulch.

25
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:31,500
- You'd think you didn't have any brains.
- I have so got brains!

26
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,936
Why don't you use them?

27
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:35,201
When you come home
don't go by her place...

28
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:39,268
...then Toto won't get in her garden
and you won't get in no trouble.

29
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:42,307
Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.

30
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:45,215
Well, your head ain't made of straw,
you know.

31
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:51,380
Get in there before I make
a dimebank out of you!

32
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:55,592
Listen, kid...

33
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,388
Are you going to let that old Gulch heifer
try and buffalo you?

34
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:04,159
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage, that's all.

35
00:04:04,237 --> 00:04:05,602
I'm not afraid of her.

36
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:08,732
The next time she squawks,
walk up to her and spit in her eye.

37
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:10,242
That's what I'd do!

38
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:18,182
Zeke, get me out of here! Help!

39
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:22,521
Are you all right, Dorothy?

40
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:24,181
Yes, I'm all right.

41
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,589
I fell in and Zeke...

42
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,997
Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am!

43
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:35,565
You gonna let a little old pig
make a coward out of you?

44
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,068
Look at you, Zeke...

45
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:39,901
What's all this jabber-wapping
when there's work to be done?

46
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:43,136
I know three farm hands
who'll be out of a job before they know it!

47
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,438
Dorothy was walking...

48
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:48,072
I saw you tinkering with that contraption.
You two get back to the wagon!

49
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:49,376
All right, Mrs. Gale.

50
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,384
Someday they're going to erect a statue
to me in this town...

51
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:54,477
Don't start posing for it now.

52
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:59,019
Here, can't work on an empty stomach.
Have some crullers. Just fried.

53
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:04,188
- Dorothy toppled into...
- It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty!

54
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:07,665
Now, you go feed those hogs
before they worry themselves into anemia!

55
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:11,693
Do you know what Miss Gulch said
she was going to do to Toto?

56
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:14,904
Now, Dorothy, stop imagining things.

57
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:17,603
You always get yourself
into a fret over nothing.

58
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:21,738
Help us out today and find a place
where you won't get into any trouble.

59
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:27,678
Some place where there isn't any trouble.

60
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:31,213
Do you suppose there is
such a place, Toto?

61
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,554
There must be.

62
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:39,060
It's not a place you can get to
by a boat or a train.

63
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:43,232
It's far, far away...

64
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,398
...behind the moon...

65
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,931
...beyond the rain...

66
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,070
"Somewhere, over the rainbow...

67
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:59,175
"...way up high

68
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:05,982
"There's a land that I heard of...

69
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:09,618
"...once in a lullaby

70
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:17,026
"Somewhere, over the rainbow...

71
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:21,130
"...skies are blue

72
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,304
"And the dreams that you dare to dream

73
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:31,907
"Really do come true

74
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:37,890
"Someday I'll wish upon a star

75
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:42,952
"And wake up where the clouds
are far behind me

76
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,929
"Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

77
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:51,470
"Away above the chimney tops

78
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:56,899
"That's where you'll find me

79
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:06,642
"Somewhere, over the rainbow...

80
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:10,579
"...bluebirds fly

81
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:17,820
"Birds fly over the rainbow

82
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:24,159
"Why then, oh, why can't I?

83
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:42,151
"If happy little bluebirds fly...

84
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:45,218
"...beyond the rainbow

85
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:50,886
"Why, oh, why can't I?"

86
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,147
Mr. Gale.

87
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:19,986
Howdy, Miss Gulch.

88
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:23,930
I want to see you and your wife
right away about Dorothy.

89
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,555
What has Dorothy done?

90
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:28,829
What's she done? I'm all but lame
from the bite on my leg!

91
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:31,393
- You mean, she bit you?
- No, her dog!

92
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:34,941
She bit her dog, eh?

93
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,773
No!

94
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:39,539
That dog's a menace.

95
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:42,275
I'll take him to the Sheriff
and make sure he's destroyed.

96
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,112
Destroyed? Toto?

97
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:46,515
Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

98
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:50,481
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!
You won't let her, will you?

99
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,115
Of course, we won't. Will we, Em?

100
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,855
Please, Aunt Em! Toto didn't mean to.

101
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:59,365
He didn't know he was doing
anything wrong. I ought to be punished.

102
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:02,560
I let him go in her garden.
You can send me to bed without supper.

103
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,730
Hand over the dog, or I'll bring
a damage suit and take your farm!

104
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:08,205
There's a law protecting folks
from dogs that bite!

105
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:09,901
What if she keeps him tied up?

106
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:12,206
He's really gentle,
with gentle people, that is.

107
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,874
Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide.
Here's his order allowing me to take him.

108
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,680
Unless you want to go against the law.

109
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:22,946
Yes...

110
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:26,715
We can't go against the law.
I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.

111
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:28,283
Now you're seeing reason.

112
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,592
Here's what I'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

113
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:33,792
No, no! I won't let you take him!

114
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,097
You go away! I'll bite you myself!

115
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:37,261
Dorothy!

116
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:38,971
You wicked old witch!

117
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,473
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em,
don't let them take Toto!

118
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,169
Don't let her take him, please! Stop her.

119
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,245
- Put him in the basket, Henry.
- The idea!

120
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:48,780
Don't, Uncle Henry.

121
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,942
Oh, Toto!

122
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:05,727
Almira Gulch, just because you own
half the county...

123
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,597
...doesn't mean you have the power
to run the rest of us!

124
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,899
For 23 years I've been dying to tell you
what I thought of you!

125
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:16,433
Well, being a Christian woman,
I can't say it!

126
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:45,428
Toto, darling! Oh, I've got you back!

127
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,104
You came back!

128
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:49,736
Oh, I'm so glad!

129
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,676
They'll be coming back for you in a minute.

130
00:10:57,951 --> 00:11:01,011
We've got to get away!
We've got to run away!

131
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,016
Well, well, well! Houseguests, huh?

132
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:42,022
And who might you be?

133
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:44,258
No, no. Now, don't tell me.

134
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:46,962
Let's see. You're...

135
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,336
You're travelling in disguise.
No, that's not right.

136
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:54,701
You're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong.

137
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:58,434
You're running away.

138
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,876
How did you guess?

139
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,942
Professor Marvel never guesses.
He knows!

140
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:04,881
Why are you running away?

141
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,543
No, no. Don't tell me.

142
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:10,623
They don't understand you at home.
They don't appreciate you.

143
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,820
You want to see other lands, big cities,
big mountains, big oceans.

144
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:17,722
It's just like you could read
what was inside of me.

145
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:22,160
Toto, that's not polite!
We haven't been asked yet.

146
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,635
He's perfectly welcome.

147
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:27,398
As one dog to another, huh?

148
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:30,271
Now, let's see. Where were we?

149
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:34,545
Please. Why can't we go with you
and see all the crowned heads of Europe?

150
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:36,878
Do you know any? You mean, the thing.

151
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:42,215
I never do anything without consulting
my crystal first.

152
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:46,458
Let's go inside here.
Just come along. I'll show you.

153
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:50,659
That's right. Here, sit right down here.
That's it.

154
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:56,531
This is the same genuine, magic,
authentic crystal...

155
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,464
...used by the priests of Isis and Osiris
in the days of the pharaohs of Egypt...

156
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:06,676
...in which Cleopatra first saw the approach
of Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony and...

157
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:08,943
...and so on and so on.

158
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:12,977
You'd better close your eyes, my child...

159
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:17,716
...for a moment, in order to be better
in tune with the infinite.

160
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:21,887
We can't do these things without...

161
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:24,556
...reaching out into the infinite.

162
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:29,767
That's all right. Now, you can open them.
We'll gaze into the crystal.

163
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,763
What's this I see?

164
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,932
A house with a picket fence...

165
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,068
...and a barn with a weathervane...

166
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,204
...of a running horse.

167
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,205
That's our farm!

168
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,880
Yes. There's a woman.

169
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,252
She's wearing a polka-dot dress.

170
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,618
Her face is careworn.

171
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,325
That's Aunt Em.

172
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:55,361
Yes. Her name is Emily.

173
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:57,791
That's right. What's she doing?

174
00:13:58,064 --> 00:14:00,225
Well, I can't quite see.

175
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,267
Why, she's crying!

176
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:06,495
Someone has hurt her.
Someone has just about broken her heart.

177
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,204
Me?

178
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:11,576
Well, it's someone she loves very much...

179
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:15,842
...someone she's been very kind to,
someone she's taken care of in sickness.

180
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:20,813
I had the measles once
and she stayed right by me every minute.

181
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:23,745
What's she doing now?

182
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,551
What's this?

183
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:29,424
Why, she's putting her hand on her heart!

184
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:32,126
She's dropping down on the bed!

185
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:33,263
Oh, no!

186
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,200
Well, that's all. The crystal's gone dark.

187
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,869
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

188
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,800
I've got to go home right away!

189
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:44,138
I thought you were going along with me!

190
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,338
No, I have to get to her right away!
Come on, Toto!

191
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:48,778
Come on! Come on!

192
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:53,809
Goodbye, Professor Marvel,
and thanks a lot!

193
00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:00,125
Better get under cover, Sylvester!
There's a storm blowing, a whopper...

194
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,928
...to speak in the vernacular
of the peasantry!

195
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:06,295
Poor little kid.
I hope she gets home all right.

196
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:19,311
Hurry up and get them horses loose!
Where's Hickory? Hickory! Hickory!

197
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:21,776
Doggone it! Hickory!

198
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:25,375
It's a twister! It's a twister!

199
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:34,017
Dorothy!

200
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,691
Dorothy!

201
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,043
Come on, everybody in the storm cellar!

202
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:06,380
Henry! I can't find Dorothy!
She's somewhere out in the storm!

203
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:07,720
Dorothy!

204
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,317
Auntie Em!

205
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,618
Auntie Em!

206
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,321
Auntie Em!

207
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:54,637
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

208
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,844
Auntie Em!

209
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:16,554
We must be up inside the cyclone!

210
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:21,923
Miss Gulch!

211
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:53,701
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore.

212
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:06,951
We must be over the rainbow!

213
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:39,657
Now, I know we're not in Kansas.

214
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,224
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

215
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:47,988
Who, me?

216
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:52,493
I'm not a witch at all.
I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.

217
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,500
Well, is that the witch?

218
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:56,639
Who, Toto?

219
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,142
Toto's my dog.

220
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:00,104
Well, I'm a little muddled.

221
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,671
The Munchkins called me because
a new witch has just dropped a house...

222
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:07,981
...on the Wicked Witch of the East.
And there's the house, and here you are...

223
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:11,489
...and that's all that's left
of the Wicked Witch of the East.

224
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:14,292
What the Munchkins want to know is...

225
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,692
...are you a good witch or a bad witch?

226
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:20,227
But, I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.

227
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,028
Witches are old and ugly.

228
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:25,692
What was that?

229
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:29,366
The Munchkins. They're laughing
because I am a witch.

230
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:31,974
I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

231
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:33,204
You are?

232
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,670
I beg your pardon!

233
00:22:35,748 --> 00:22:38,740
But I've never heard
of a beautiful witch before.

234
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:41,176
Only bad witches are ugly.

235
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:46,282
The Munchkins are happy. You freed them
from the Wicked Witch of the East.

236
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:48,849
But, if you please, what are Munchkins?

237
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:52,420
The little people who live in this land.
It's Munchkin Land...

238
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:55,092
...and you are their national heroine,
my dear.

239
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,568
It's all right, you may all come out
and thank her.

240
00:22:59,305 --> 00:23:03,298
"Come out, come out wherever you are

241
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:08,577
"And meet the young lady
who fell from a star

242

"She fell from the sky, she fell very far

243

"And Kansas, she says,
is the name of the star

244
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:26,087
"Kansas, she says, is the name of the star

245

"She brings you good news,
or haven't you heard?

246
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,834
"When she fell out of Kansas
a miracle occurred

247
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:47,180
"It really was no miracle
What happened was just this:

248
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:50,552
"The wind began to switch,
the house to pitch

249
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:54,022
"And suddenly the hinges started
to unhitch

250
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:57,457
"Just then the Witch, to satisfy an itch

251
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,927
"Went flying on her broomstick
thumbing for a hitch

252
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,863
"And, oh, what happened then was rich

253
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:08,073
"The house began to pitch,
the kitchen took a slitch

254
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:11,107
"It landed on the Wicked Witch
in the middle of a ditch

255
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:15,840
"Which was not a healthy situation
for the Wicked Witch

00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:43,880
- "You'll be history
- You'll be history

313
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:47,612

00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:49,011

00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:52,982
"In the hall of fame"

317
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:24,386
I thought you said she was dead.

318
00:29:24,456 --> 00:29:26,947
That was her sister,
the Wicked Witch of the East.

319
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:30,654
This is the Wicked Witch of the West.
She's worse than the other one was.

320
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:34,597
Who killed my sister?
Who killed the Witch of the East?

321
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,464
Was it you?

322
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:40,436
No, no. It was an accident.
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

323
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:43,866
Well, my little pretty,
I can cause accidents, too!

324
00:29:44,142 --> 00:29:46,042
Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers?

325
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:47,703
The slippers, yes!

326
00:29:49,014 --> 00:29:50,413
The slippers!

327
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,948
They're gone!

328
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:01,390
The ruby slippers!
What have you done with them?

329
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,360
Give them back to me or I'Il...

330
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,225
It's too late! There they are...

331
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:06,992
...and there they'll stay!

332
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:12,664
Give me back my slippers!

333
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:14,603
I'm the only one who knows
how to use them.

334
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:17,198
They're of no use to you.
Give them back to me.

335
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,740
- Give them back!
- Keep tight inside of them.

336
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:23,178
Their magic must be very powerful,
or she wouldn't want them so badly.

337
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:26,274
You stay out of this, Glinda,
or I'll fix you as well!

338
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,510
Rubbish! You have no power here.

339
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,647
Begone, before somebody drops a house
on you, too!

340
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,452
Very well, I'll bide my time.

341
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:37,120
And as for you, my fine lady...

342
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:40,130
...it's true I can't attend to you
here and now as I'd like...

343
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:42,462
...but just try to stay out of my way.

344
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:43,660
Just try!

345
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:47,403
I'll get you, my pretty,
and your little dog, too!

346
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,745
It's all right. You can get up. She's gone.

347
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,882
It's all right. You can all get up.

348
00:31:06,191 --> 00:31:07,954
What a smell of sulphur!

349
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:11,223
I'm afraid you've made a bad enemy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

350
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:15,596
The sooner you get out of Oz altogether,
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

351
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:18,795
I'd give anything to get out of Oz
altogether, but...

352
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:23,064
...which is the way back to Kansas?
I can't go the way I came.

353
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:26,177
No, that's true.
The only person who might know...

354
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:29,710
...would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself!

355
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:33,208
The Wizard of Oz?
Is he good or is he wicked?

356
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:37,377
Very good, but very mysterious.
He lives in the Emerald City...

357
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:41,722
...and that's a long journey from here.
Did you bring your broomstick with you?

358
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,889
No, I'm afraid I didn't.

359
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:45,793
Well, then, you'll have to walk.

360
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:49,391
The Munchkins will see you safely
to the border of Munchkin Land.

361
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:53,938
And remember, never let those
ruby slippers off your feet for a moment...

362
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:57,768
...or you will be at the mercy
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

363
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:01,210
But how do I start for Emerald City?

364
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,543
It's always best to start at the beginning...

365
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:06,482
...and all you do
is follow the Yellow Brick Road.

366
00:32:16,962 --> 00:32:18,554
But, what happens if l...

367
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,155
Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

368
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:23,928
Goodbye. Goodbye.

369
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:38,905
My!

370
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:41,983
People come and go so quickly here!

371
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,824
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

372
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:51,361
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

373
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:54,764
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

374
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:58,034
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

375
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:00,337
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

376
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,134
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

377
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:05,643
"Follow the Yellow Brick Road
Follow the Yellow Brick Road

378
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,146

00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,032
Follow the Yellow...

388
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,301
Now which way do we go?

389
00:34:06,371 --> 00:34:09,238
Pardon me. That way is a very nice way.

390
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,177
Who said that?

391
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:20,545
Don't be silly, Toto. Scarecrows don't talk.

392
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:23,212
It's pleasant down that way, too.

393
00:34:24,823 --> 00:34:26,085
That's funny.

394
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:28,821
Wasn't he pointing the other way?

395
00:34:28,894 --> 00:34:31,260
Of course, people do go both ways.

396
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,964
You did say something, didn't you?

397
00:34:43,074 --> 00:34:46,237
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

398
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:49,337
That's the trouble.
I can't make up my mind.

399
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:52,515
I haven't got a brain, only straw.

400
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:56,112
How can you talk
if you haven't got a brain?

401
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:57,886
I don't know.

402
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:02,053
But some people without brains
do an awful lot of talking, don't they?

403
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:04,152
Yes, I guess you're right.

404
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:08,864
Well, we haven't really met properly,
have we?

405
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:11,127
Why, no!

406
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:12,565
How do you do?

407
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:13,965
How do you do?

408
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,267
Very well, thank you.

409
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,205
I'm not feeling at all well.

410
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:22,679
It's very tedious being stuck up here
all day long with a pole up your back.

411
00:35:22,814 --> 00:35:26,807
That must be terribly uncomfortable.
Can't you get down?

412
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:29,752
Down? No, you see, I'm... Well, I'm...

413
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:32,049
Well, here, let me help you.

414
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,988
That's very kind of you, very kind.

415
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,589
I don't quite see how...

416
00:35:38,997 --> 00:35:41,864
Of course, I'm not bright
about doing things...

417
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,803
...but if you'll just bend the nail down
in the back, maybe I'll slip off and...

418
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:48,029
Oh, yes.

419
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,675
There goes some of me again!

420
00:35:52,744 --> 00:35:53,802
Does it hurt you?

421
00:35:53,878 --> 00:35:57,746
Oh, no. I just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again.

422
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:00,108
My! It's good to be free!

423
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:03,719
Did I scare you?

424
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:06,848
No, no. I just thought you hurt yourself.

425
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:08,550
But I didn't scare you?

426
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,159
No, of course not.

427
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:11,894
I didn't think so.

428
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,132
You see, I can't even scare a crow.

429
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,770
They come from miles around
just to eat in my field and laugh in my face.

430
00:36:25,844 --> 00:36:29,143
I'm a failure because I haven't got a brain!

431
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:32,812
What would you do with a brain
if you had one?

432
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:35,682
Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could...

do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!

00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:46,222
- They would?
- Yes.

452
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:47,416
Where's Kansas?

453
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:48,823
That's where I live.

454
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:52,021
I want to get back there so badly
I'm going to Emerald City...

455
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:54,156
...to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.

456
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:56,462
You're going to see a wizard?

457
00:37:57,202 --> 00:38:00,569
Do you think if I went with you
this wizard would give me some brains?

458
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:02,105
I couldn't say.

459
00:38:02,674 --> 00:38:06,201
But even if he didn't,
you'd be no worse off than you are now.

460
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:08,176
Yes, that's true.

461
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:12,046
You'd better not. I've got a witch
mad at me and you might get into trouble.

462
00:38:12,117 --> 00:38:13,243
Witch?

463
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:16,446
I'm not afraid of a witch.
I'm not afraid of anything!

464
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:20,588
Except a lighted match.

465
00:38:20,692 --> 00:38:22,159
I don't blame you for that.

466
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:26,323
But I'd face a whole box full of them
for the chance of getting some brains.

467
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:31,029
I won't be any trouble
because I don't eat a thing.

468
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:34,401
I won't try to manage things
because I can't think.

469
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:36,902
Won't you take me with you?

470
00:38:37,575 --> 00:38:38,940
Of course, I will!

471
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:42,109
Hooray! We're off to see a wizard!

472
00:38:42,414 --> 00:38:44,575
Well, you're not starting out very well.

473
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:46,947
I'll try! Really, I will.

474
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:49,119
- To Oz?
- To Oz!

475
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,384
"We're off to see the Wizard
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz

476
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:57,185

Apples!

482
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:31,022
Oh, look!

483
00:39:39,871 --> 00:39:41,862
What do you think you're doing?

484
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:46,868
We've been walking a long ways
and I was hungry and...

485
00:39:47,946 --> 00:39:49,436
Did you say something?

486
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,607
- She was hungry!
- She was hungry!

487
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:55,779
How would you like to have someone
come along and pick something off of you?

488
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,478
Oh, dear! I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.

489
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:04,155
Come along, Dorothy,
you don't want any of those apples.

490
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:06,561
Are you hinting my apples aren't
what they should be?

491
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:10,362
Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like
little green worms!

492
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:11,565
You!

493
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,802
I'll show you how to get apples.

494
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:28,511
Hooray! I guess that did it! Help yourself.

495
00:40:53,678 --> 00:40:55,202
Why, it's a man!

496
00:40:57,048 --> 00:40:58,913
A man made out of tin!

497
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:00,782
- What?
- Yes.

498
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:04,013
Look!

499
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,918
Oilcan.

500
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:09,957
Did you say something?

501
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:11,154
Oilcan.

502
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,854
He said, "Oilcan."

503
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:15,497
"Oilcan" what?

504
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:16,722
Oilcan?

505
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:21,299
Here it is!

506
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:24,906
- Where do you want to be oiled first?
- My mouth.

507
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:27,000
- My mouth.
- He said his mouth.

508
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,639
The other side.

509
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:45,488
My goodness, I can talk again!

510
00:41:46,497 --> 00:41:48,965
Oil my arms, please, oil my elbows.

511
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:51,424
Here.

512
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,365
Did that hurt?

513
00:41:56,441 --> 00:42:00,673
No, it feels wonderful.
I've held that axe up for ages.

514
00:42:01,512 --> 00:42:02,536
Goodness!

515
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,009
How did you ever get like this?

516
00:42:07,452 --> 00:42:10,546
About a year ago,
I was chopping that tree...

517
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,885
...when suddenly it began to rain.

518
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:16,551
And right in the middle of a chop,
I rusted solid.

519
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:19,429
I've been that way ever since.

520
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,525
Well, you're perfect now.

521
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:26,328
My neck. My neck.

522
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:27,929
Perfect?

523
00:42:28,406 --> 00:42:30,966
Bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.

524
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:33,036
Go ahead, bang on it.

525
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,705
Beautiful! What an echo!

526
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:39,846
It's empty.

527
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:43,612
The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

528
00:42:44,656 --> 00:42:45,816
No heart?

529
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:47,713
No heart.

530
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,922
All hollow.

531

Oh, dear!

555
00:45:36,794 --> 00:45:38,455
That was wonderful!

556
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,390
You know...

557
00:45:41,332 --> 00:45:44,699
We were wondering why you couldn't
come with us to the Emerald City...

558
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:46,600
...to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart?

559
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:49,765
Suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one
when we got there?

560
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:52,366
But he will! He must!

561
00:45:53,144 --> 00:45:55,635
We've come such a long way already.

562
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:03,413
You call that long?

563
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:05,387
Why, you've just begun!

564
00:46:05,656 --> 00:46:09,524
Helping the little lady along, are you,
my fine gentlemen?

565
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,685
Well, stay away from her...

566
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:13,989
...or I'll stuff a mattress with you!

567
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:16,525
And you!

568
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:19,202
I'll use you for a beehive!

569
00:46:19,437 --> 00:46:22,065
Here, Scarecrow! Want to play ball?

570
00:46:26,143 --> 00:46:29,442
Lookout! I'm burning! I'm burning!

571
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,923
I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get safely
to the Wizard now...

572
00:46:45,997 --> 00:46:50,093
...whether I get a brain or not!
"Stuff a mattress with me," hah!

573
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,332
I'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether I get a heart or not.

574
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:58,432
"Beehive," bah! Let her try
and make a beehive out of me!

575
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:04,642
You're the best friends anybody ever had.

576
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:08,950
And it's funny, but I feel
as if I've known you all the time.

577
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,349
But I couldn't have, could I?

578
00:47:11,422 --> 00:47:15,483
I don't see how. You weren't around
when I was stuffed and sewn together...

579
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:16,457
...were you?

580
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:20,190
And I was standing over there rusting
for the longest time.

581
00:47:20,364 --> 00:47:24,858
Still, I wish I could remember.
But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.

582
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,870
We know each other now, don't we?

583
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:29,964
- That's right.
- We do.

584
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:31,765

It's dark and creepy!

593
00:48:25,196 --> 00:48:29,758
Of course, I don't know, but I think
it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

Do you suppose we'll meet
any wild animals?

We might.

596

Animals that eat straw?

597
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:43,342
Some, but mostly lions
and tigers and bears.

Lions!

599

Which one of you first?

609
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,998
I'll fight you both together, if you want.

610
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:38,058
I'll fight you with one paw tied
behind my back!

611

I'll fight you standing on one foot!

Pulling an axe on me, eh?

614
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:49,773
Sneaking up on me, eh? Why...

615
00:49:52,616 --> 00:49:55,585
- Here, here. Go away and let us alone.
- Scared, huh?

616
00:49:55,953 --> 00:49:57,284
Afraid, huh?

617
00:49:57,922 --> 00:50:00,584
How long can you stay fresh in that can?

618

Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junkyard!

Put your hands up,
you lopsided bag of hay!

620

Now, that's getting personal, Lion.

621
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:14,030
Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

622

Well, what's wrong with you teaching him?

623

I'll get you anyway, Pee-Wee.

625
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,584
Shame on you!

626
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:38,426
What did you do that for? I didn't bite him.

627
00:50:38,696 --> 00:50:40,391
No, but you tried to.

628
00:50:40,598 --> 00:50:44,659
It's bad enough picking on a straw man,
but when you pick on poor little dogs...

629
00:50:44,735 --> 00:50:47,397
You didn't have to go and hit me, did you?

630
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:50,634
Is my nose bleeding?

631
00:50:50,941 --> 00:50:52,408
Well, of course not.

632
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:57,213
My goodness, what a fuss you're making!

633
00:50:57,348 --> 00:51:01,546
Naturally, when you go around
picking on things weaker than you are...

634
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,780
...you're nothing but a great, big coward!

635
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:06,049
You're right, I am a coward!

636
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:09,392
I haven't any courage at all.

637
00:51:09,927 --> 00:51:11,758
I even scare myself.

638
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,455
Look at the circles under my eyes.

639
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:17,364
I haven't slept in weeks.

640
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:19,827
Why don't you try counting sheep?

641
00:51:19,937 --> 00:51:22,997
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of them.

642
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:25,806
That's too bad.

643
00:51:27,144 --> 00:51:29,704
Don't you think
the Wizard could help him, too?

644
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,247
I don't see why not.

645
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:33,512
Why don't you come along with us?

646
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:36,451
We're on our way to see the Wizard now.
To get him a heart.

647
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,646
And him a brain.

648
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:39,780
I'm sure he could give you some courage.

649
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:44,894
Wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen
in the company of a cowardly lion?

650
00:51:45,596 --> 00:51:46,620
I would.

651
00:51:47,531 --> 00:51:49,192
No, of course not!

652
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:52,830
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

653
00:51:53,971 --> 00:51:56,906
My life has been simply unbearable.

654
00:51:57,775 --> 00:52:01,643
Well, it's all right now.
The Wizard'll fix everything.

655
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:04,574
It's been in me so long...

656
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:07,749
...I just gotta tell you how I feel.

657
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:09,852
Well, come on!

658
00:52:10,387 --> 00:52:14,483
"Yeah, it's sad, believe me, missy

So, you won't take warning, eh?

681
00:53:26,463 --> 00:53:28,021
All the worse for you!

682
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:31,127
I'll take care of you now instead of later!

683

When I gain those ruby slippers,
my power will be the greatest in Oz!

And now, my beauties...

...something with poison in it, I think.

686

With poison in it...

There's Emerald City!

695
00:54:41,638 --> 00:54:44,368
We're almost there at last! At last!

696
00:54:45,275 --> 00:54:48,904
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.

697
00:54:49,613 --> 00:54:52,912
He really must be a wonderful wizard
to live in a city like that!

698
00:54:52,983 --> 00:54:54,780
Come on. What are we waiting for?

699
00:54:54,852 --> 00:54:56,217
Nothing! Let's hurry!

700
00:54:56,286 --> 00:54:57,685
Yes, let's run!

701
00:55:02,493 --> 00:55:03,858
Come on, come on!

702
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:05,189
Hurry! Hurry!

703
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:10,265
Look!

704
00:55:12,403 --> 00:55:13,529
Come on!

705
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:14,926
The city!

706
00:55:15,005 --> 00:55:17,337
It's wonderful! The Emerald City!

707
00:55:23,046 --> 00:55:24,411
What's happening?

708
00:55:24,748 --> 00:55:26,113
What is it?

709
00:55:26,717 --> 00:55:28,241
I can't run anymore.

710
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,108
I'm so sleepy.

711
00:55:30,187 --> 00:55:32,348
Give us your hands
and we'll pull you along.

712
00:55:32,423 --> 00:55:33,549
No, please.

713
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,986
I have to rest for just a minute.

714
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,092
Toto...

715
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:38,355
Where's Toto?

716
00:55:38,796 --> 00:55:41,094
You can't rest now. We're nearly there.

717
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:46,027
Don't cry, you'll rust yourself again!

718
00:55:46,103 --> 00:55:49,402
Come to think of it,
forty winks wouldn't be bad.

719
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:51,935
Don't you start it, too!

720
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:54,636
No! We ought to try and carry Dorothy!

721
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:56,938
I don't think I could, but we could try.

722
00:55:57,014 --> 00:55:58,174
- Let's.
- Yes.

723
00:55:59,483 --> 00:56:01,542
Now look at him! This is terrible!

724
00:56:01,618 --> 00:56:03,245
Here, Tin Man, help me.

725
00:56:05,622 --> 00:56:08,557
This is terrible! I can't budge her an inch!

726
00:56:08,926 --> 00:56:10,621
This is a spell, this is!

727
00:56:10,694 --> 00:56:13,060
It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do?

728
00:56:13,797 --> 00:56:14,786
Help!

729
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:16,288
Help!

730
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:20,665
It's no use screaming at a time like this.
Nobody will hear you! Help!

731
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:22,864
Help!

732
00:56:28,011 --> 00:56:29,239
It's snowing!

733
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:32,012
No, it isn't!

734
00:56:33,517 --> 00:56:34,711
Yes, it is!

735
00:56:36,487 --> 00:56:37,954
Maybe that'll help!

736
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:40,716
But it couldn't help!

737
00:56:41,692 --> 00:56:44,661
It does help! Dorothy, you're waking up!

738
00:56:52,236 --> 00:56:54,727
Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?

739
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:57,640
Look, he's rusted again!

740
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:02,607
- Give me the oilcan, quick!
- Here! Oil him.

741
00:57:03,547 --> 00:57:04,844
- He is rusted.
- Here.

742
00:57:04,915 --> 00:57:06,382
Here. Quick!

743
00:57:08,785 --> 00:57:12,312
Curses! Curses!
Somebody always helps that girl!

744
00:57:14,758 --> 00:57:18,751
But shoes or no shoes,
I'm still great enough to conquer her.

745
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:20,729
And woe to those who try to stop me!

746
00:57:20,864 --> 00:57:22,957
Come on, let's get out of here.

747
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:26,063
Look, Emerald City is closer

We did!

Can't you read?

- The notice!

What notice?

Now, state your business.

773
00:59:04,267 --> 00:59:06,735
But nobody can see the great Oz!

774
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,963
Nobody's ever seen the great Oz!
Even I've never seen him!

Well, then, how do you know there is one?

776
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:15,476
Because he's...

777

She's wearing the ruby slippers

00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:41,762
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

786
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:45,069
That's a horse of a different color!
Come on in!

787
00:59:57,854 --> 01:00:00,914
Cabby! Cabby!
Just what you're looking for!

788
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:03,354
Take you any place in the city, we does!

789
01:00:03,427 --> 01:00:05,292
Would you take us to see the Wizard?

790
01:00:05,362 --> 01:00:07,523
The Wizard? The Wizard?

791
01:00:10,067 --> 01:00:11,364
Yes, of course.

792
01:00:11,435 --> 01:00:15,269
But first I'll take you to a little place
where you can tidy up a bit.

793
01:00:15,505 --> 01:00:17,029
Thank you so much.

794
01:00:17,374 --> 01:00:20,832
We've been gone such a long time,
and we feel so...

795
01:00:22,345 --> 01:00:26,714
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse like that before!

796
01:00:26,817 --> 01:00:30,753
No, and never will again, I fancy.
There's only one of him, and he's it.

797
01:00:30,954 --> 01:00:34,321
He's the Horse of a Different Color
you've heard tell about.

798
01:00:35,025 --> 01:00:36,822
"Ha, ha, ha

It's the Witch! She's followed us here!

Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

837

The Wizard will explain it!

Whatever shall we do?

841
01:02:44,187 --> 01:02:46,655
We'd better hurry
if we're going to see the Wizard!

842
01:02:48,825 --> 01:02:52,283
Here! Here, here! Everything is all right.

843

Stop that now.

844
01:02:54,698 --> 01:02:56,962
It's all right! Everything is all right!

845
01:02:57,033 --> 01:03:01,936
The great and powerful Oz
has got matters well in hand. I hope.

846
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:04,631
And so you can all go home!

847
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,573
And there's nothing to worry about!

848
01:03:06,643 --> 01:03:09,339
Get out of here now, go on!
Go on home and...

849
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,706
Go home.

850
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:15,142
If you please, we want to see
the Wizard right away.

851
01:03:15,218 --> 01:03:16,276
All four of us.

852
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:18,981
Orders are: Nobody can see the great Oz!

853
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:20,716
Not nobody, not nohow!

854
01:03:21,491 --> 01:03:23,584
But, please. It's very important.

855
01:03:23,927 --> 01:03:26,225
And I got a permanent
just for the occasion.

856
01:03:26,296 --> 01:03:28,491
Not nobody, not nohow!

857
01:03:28,899 --> 01:03:30,423
But she's Dorothy!

858
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:32,728
The Witch's Dorothy?

859
01:03:34,905 --> 01:03:36,998
Well, that makes a difference.

860
01:03:38,375 --> 01:03:40,900
Wait here. I'll announce you at once!

861
01:03:45,582 --> 01:03:48,210
Did you hear that?
He'll announce us at once!

862
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:51,617
- I've as good as got my brain!
- I can fairly hear my heart beating.

863
01:03:51,688 --> 01:03:55,749
- I'll be home in time for supper!
- In another hour I'll be King of the Forest.

864
01:03:55,992 --> 01:03:58,017
Long live the King!

865
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:10,135
"If I were King of the Forest

you wouldn't be afraid of anything?

- How about a hippopotamus?
- Why, I'd trash him from top to bottomus!

888
01:06:34,384 --> 01:06:37,410
- Suppose you met an elephant?
- I'd wrap him up in cellophant!

889
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:41,355
- What if it were a brontosaurus?
- I'd show him who was King of the Forest!

- How?
- How?

891

Courage!

892
01:06:45,728 --> 01:06:47,662
What makes a king out of a slave?

01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:48,526
Courage!

894
01:06:48,598 --> 01:06:51,590
What makes the flag on the mast to wave?

895
01:06:52,168 --> 01:06:53,100
Courage!

896
01:06:53,169 --> 01:06:57,833
What makes the elephant charge his tusk
in the misty mist, or the dusky dusk?

897
01:06:59,109 --> 01:07:02,203
What makes the muskrat guard his musk?

898
01:07:02,979 --> 01:07:03,843
Courage!

899
01:07:03,913 --> 01:07:06,245
What makes the sphinx
the Seventh Wonder?

900

Courage!

901
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,775
What makes the dawn come up
like thunder?

Courage!

903
01:07:12,155 --> 01:07:14,180
What makes the Hottentot so hot?

What puts the "ape" in apricot?

What have they got that I ain't got?

Courage!

907
01:07:19,963 --> 01:07:21,590
You can say that again.

908
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:28,037
The Wizard says, "Go away!"

909
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:35,470
Go away?

910
01:07:36,846 --> 01:07:39,815
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.

911
01:07:42,018 --> 01:07:43,815
And I was so happy!

912
01:07:44,888 --> 01:07:46,879
I thought I was on my way home.

913
01:07:47,056 --> 01:07:48,387
Don't cry, Dorothy.

914
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,948
We'll get you to the Wizard.

915
01:07:50,026 --> 01:07:51,618
We certainly are.

916
01:07:52,562 --> 01:07:56,498
Auntie Em was so good to me,
and I never appreciated it.

917
01:07:57,367 --> 01:08:00,165
Running away and hurting her feelings.

918
01:08:00,837 --> 01:08:02,998
Professor Marvel said she was sick.

919
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,008
She may be dying...

920
01:08:06,643 --> 01:08:08,338
...and it's all my fault.

921
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:13,243
I'll never forgive myself!

922
01:08:14,284 --> 01:08:15,842
Never, never, never!

923
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,915
Please, don't cry anymore.

924
01:08:23,493 --> 01:08:26,553
I'll get you in to the Wizard somehow.

925
01:08:26,963 --> 01:08:30,490
Come on. I had an Aunt Em myself once!

926
01:08:51,421 --> 01:08:54,254
Wait a minute, fellows.
I was just thinking...

927
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:56,924
I really don't want to see the Wizard
this much.

928
01:08:56,993 --> 01:08:58,961
I better wait for you outside.

929
01:08:59,095 --> 01:09:02,030
- What's the matter?
- He's just scared again.

930
01:09:02,098 --> 01:09:04,828
Don't you know the Wizard
will give you some courage?

931
01:09:04,901 --> 01:09:07,529
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.

932
01:09:08,271 --> 01:09:10,364
Well then, we'll ask him for you.

933
01:09:10,707 --> 01:09:12,402
I'd sooner wait outside.

934
01:09:13,009 --> 01:09:14,237
Why? Why?

935
01:09:14,877 --> 01:09:17,402
Because I'm still scared!

936
01:09:22,185 --> 01:09:24,949
- What happened?
- Somebody pulled my tail!

937
01:09:25,755 --> 01:09:27,245
You did it yourself!

938
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:30,948
Come on.

939
01:09:34,697 --> 01:09:37,029
<i>Come forward!</i>

940
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:39,130
Tell me when it's over!

941
01:09:50,446 --> 01:09:52,277
Look at that! Look at that!

942
01:09:56,452 --> 01:09:58,613
I want to go home!

943
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:02,349
<i>I am Oz...</i>

944
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:05,020
<i>... the great and powerful!</i>

945
01:10:05,595 --> 01:10:06,926
<i>Who are you?</i>

946
01:10:09,165 --> 01:10:10,757
<i>Who are you?</i>

947
01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:19,507
If you please, I am Dorothy...

948
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,441
...the small and meek.

949
01:10:24,447 --> 01:10:25,914
We've come to ask...

950
01:10:26,282 --> 01:10:27,408
<i>Silence!</i>

951
01:10:29,185 --> 01:10:30,550
Jiminy Crickets!

952
01:10:30,953 --> 01:10:35,822
<i>The great and powerful Oz
knows why you have come.</i>

953
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:40,023
<i>Step forward, Tin Man!</i>

954
01:10:46,436 --> 01:10:50,270
<i>You dare to come to me
for a heart, do you?</i>

955
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,800
<i>You clinking, clanking,
clattering collection of caliginousjunk!</i>

956
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,574
Yes, sir.

957
01:11:01,918 --> 01:11:03,283
Yes, Your Honor.

958
01:11:03,586 --> 01:11:06,180
You see, a while back...

959
01:11:06,456 --> 01:11:09,016
...we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road, and...

960
01:11:09,092 --> 01:11:10,116
<i>Quiet!</i>

961
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:14,922
<i>And you, Scarecrow...</i>

962
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:18,027
<i>... have the effrontery to ask for a brain...</i>

963
01:11:18,835 --> 01:11:22,362
<i>... you billowing bale of bovine fodder!</i>

964
01:11:24,741 --> 01:11:26,902
Yes, Your Honor. I mean, Your Excellency.

965
01:11:26,976 --> 01:11:28,807
I mean, Your Wizardry!

966
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:30,446
<i>Enough!</i>

967
01:11:31,948 --> 01:11:33,916
<i>And you, Lion!</i>

968
01:11:40,223 --> 01:11:41,190
<i>Well?</i>

969
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,294
You ought to be ashamed of yourself...

970
01:11:50,733 --> 01:11:53,634
...frightening him like that
when he came to you for help!

971
01:11:53,703 --> 01:11:55,898
<i>Silence, whippersnapper!</i>

972
01:11:56,606 --> 01:12:01,270
<i>The beneficent Oz has every intention
of granting your requests!</i>

973
01:12:02,211 --> 01:12:05,339
What's that? What'd he say?
What'd he say?

974
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:09,210
<i>But first,
you must prove yourselves worthy...</i>

975
01:12:09,519 --> 01:12:12,955
<i>... by performing a very small task.</i>

976
01:12:14,290 --> 01:12:17,453
<i>Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.</i>

977
01:12:18,261 --> 01:12:21,230
But if we do that,
we'll have to kill her to get it!

978
01:12:21,297 --> 01:12:23,595
<i>Bring me her broomstick...</i>

979
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,434
<i>... and I'll grant your requests.</i>

980
01:12:27,303 --> 01:12:28,600
<i>Now, go!</i>

981
01:12:30,039 --> 01:12:31,939
But what if she kills us first?

982
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:33,669
<i>I said, "Go!"</i>

983
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:22,749
"I'd turn back if I were you!"

984
01:13:47,316 --> 01:13:48,806
Oh, look!

985
01:13:53,823 --> 01:13:56,121
I believe there're spooks around here.

986
01:13:56,859 --> 01:13:59,692
That's ridiculous! Spooks! That's silly.

987
01:14:00,162 --> 01:14:02,323
Don't you believe in spooks?

988
01:14:02,398 --> 01:14:03,695
No. Why, only...

989
01:14:05,434 --> 01:14:06,662
Tin Man!

990
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:15,535
Are you all right?

991
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:17,738
I do believe in spooks.
I do believe in spooks.

992
01:14:17,813 --> 01:14:19,542
I do, I do, I do, I do.

993
01:14:19,615 --> 01:14:21,947
<i>I do believe in spooks.
I do believe in spooks!</i>

994
01:14:22,018 --> 01:14:24,646
<i>I do, I do, I do, I do, I do!</i>

995
01:14:26,122 --> 01:14:29,580
You'll believe in more than that
before I'm finished with you.

996
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:34,794
Take your army to the Haunted Forest
and bring me the girl and her dog.

997
01:14:34,864 --> 01:14:38,231
Do as you like with the others,
but I want her alive and unharmed!

998
01:14:38,301 --> 01:14:40,963
They'll give you no trouble.
I promise you that.

999
01:14:41,037 --> 01:14:44,973
I've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

1000
01:14:45,775 --> 01:14:50,542
Take special care of those ruby slippers.
I want those most of all. Now, fly!

1001
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,906
Fly! Bring me that girl and her slippers!

1002
01:14:54,317 --> 01:14:56,842
Fly! Fly! Fly!

1003
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:25,840
Help!

1004
01:15:25,915 --> 01:15:27,280
Help! Help!

1005
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,077
Go away now!

1006
01:15:29,986 --> 01:15:31,146
Help! Help!

1007
01:15:32,455 --> 01:15:35,219
Toto! Toto! Help! Toto!

1008
01:15:53,643 --> 01:15:55,110
What happened to you?

1009
01:15:55,177 --> 01:15:57,611
They tore my legs off
and threw them over there!

1010
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,080
Then they took my chest out
and threw it over there!

1011
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:03,880
- Well, that's you all over.
- They sure knocked the stuffing out of you.

1012
01:16:03,953 --> 01:16:06,114
Don't stand there talking!
Put me together!

1013
01:16:06,188 --> 01:16:07,678
We've got to find Dorothy!

1014
01:16:07,757 --> 01:16:09,122
Now, let's see...

1015
01:16:12,228 --> 01:16:14,196
What a nice little dog.

1016
01:16:18,868 --> 01:16:22,167
And you, my dear,
what an unexpected pleasure.

1017
01:16:22,705 --> 01:16:26,004
It's so kind of you to visit me
in my Ioneliness.

1018
01:16:28,444 --> 01:16:31,470
What are you going to do with my dog?
Give him back to me!

1019
01:16:31,547 --> 01:16:35,950
All in good time, my little pretty,
all in good time.

1020
01:16:36,185 --> 01:16:38,210
Please, give me back my dog!

1021
01:16:38,287 --> 01:16:40,152
Certainly, certainly...

1022
01:16:40,756 --> 01:16:43,054
...when you give me those slippers.

1023
01:16:43,693 --> 01:16:46,025
But the Good Witch of the North
told me not to.

1024
01:16:46,095 --> 01:16:47,187
Very well.

1025
01:16:47,763 --> 01:16:49,890
Throw that basket in the river
and drown him.

1026
01:16:49,965 --> 01:16:51,694
No! No. No. Here.

1027
01:16:51,867 --> 01:16:54,392
You can have your slippers
but give me back Toto!

1028
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:56,267
That's a good little girl.

1029
01:16:56,338 --> 01:16:58,568
I knew you'd see reason!

1030
01:17:02,244 --> 01:17:05,577
I'm sorry. I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?

1031
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:08,740
No! Fool that I am,
I should have remembered...

1032
01:17:10,252 --> 01:17:12,652
...those slippers will never come off...

1033
01:17:12,755 --> 01:17:15,280
...as long as you're alive.

1034
01:17:16,759 --> 01:17:20,286
But that's not what's worrying me.
It's how to do it.

1035
01:17:20,863 --> 01:17:23,229
These things must be done delicately...

1036
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:25,799
...or you hurt the spell.

1037
01:17:26,368 --> 01:17:27,528
Run, Toto! Run!

1038
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:29,093
Catch him, you fool!

1039
01:17:39,148 --> 01:17:40,137
Run, Toto!

1040
01:17:41,884 --> 01:17:43,249
Run, Toto! Run!

1041
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,420
He got away! He got away!

1042
01:17:48,357 --> 01:17:51,884
Which is more than you will!
Drat you and your dog!

1043
01:17:52,228 --> 01:17:55,061
You've been more trouble to me
than you're worth...

1044
01:17:55,131 --> 01:17:57,122
...but it'll soon be over now!

1045
01:18:00,002 --> 01:18:03,768
Do you see that? That's how much longer
you've got to be alive!

1046
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:06,840
And it isn't long, my pretty. It isn't long!

1047
01:18:07,009 --> 01:18:09,409
I can't wait forever to get those shoes!

1048
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:33,131
I'm frightened.

1049
01:18:34,203 --> 01:18:36,694
I'm frightened, Auntie Em, I'm frightened!

1050
01:18:40,209 --> 01:18:41,176
<i>Dorothy?</i>

1051
01:18:42,077 --> 01:18:44,307
<i>Dorothy, where are you?</i>

1052
01:18:44,747 --> 01:18:46,647
<i>It's me, it's Auntie Em.</i>

1053
01:18:47,016 --> 01:18:49,814
<i>We're trying to find you! Where are you?</i>

1054
01:18:50,486 --> 01:18:52,454
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em!

1055
01:18:52,721 --> 01:18:55,019
I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...

1056
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:58,024
...and I'm trying to get home to you,
Auntie Em!

1057
01:18:58,861 --> 01:19:01,921
Auntie Em, don't go away! I'm frightened!

1058
01:19:02,965 --> 01:19:04,728
Come back! Come back!

1059
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,530
<i>"Auntie Em. Auntie Em, come back!"</i>

1060
01:19:07,903 --> 01:19:10,064
<i>I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!</i>

1061
01:19:36,966 --> 01:19:38,433
Look! There's Toto!

1062
01:19:39,134 --> 01:19:40,658
Where'd he come from?

1063
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:45,629
Why, don't you see?
He's come to take us to Dorothy!

1064
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:49,202
Come on, fellows!

1065
01:20:08,063 --> 01:20:10,088
I hope my strength holds out.

1066
01:20:10,232 --> 01:20:12,063
I hope your tail holds out.

1067
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,306
What's that?

1068
01:20:27,383 --> 01:20:29,408
That's the castle of the Wicked Witch!

1069
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:31,282
Dorothy's in that awful place?

1070
01:20:31,353 --> 01:20:34,811
I hate to think of her in there.
We've got to get her out!

1071
01:20:34,957 --> 01:20:37,482
Don't cry now.
We haven't got the oilcan with us...

1072
01:20:37,559 --> 01:20:39,618
...and you've been squeaking enough.

1073
01:20:39,828 --> 01:20:41,318
Who's them?

1074
01:20:56,245 --> 01:20:58,304
I've got a plan how to get in there.

1075
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,075
Fine. He's got a plan.

1076
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:02,549
- And you're going to lead us.
- Yeah.

1077
01:21:03,218 --> 01:21:04,776
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1078
01:21:06,055 --> 01:21:08,649
- I gotta get her out of there?
- That's right.

1079
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:12,616
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy...

1080
01:21:13,028 --> 01:21:15,121
...Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...

1081
01:21:15,197 --> 01:21:18,030
...guards or no guards, I'll tear 'em apart.

1082
01:21:19,468 --> 01:21:22,631
I may not come out alive
but I'm going in there.

1083
01:21:23,072 --> 01:21:25,540
There's only one thing
I want you fellows to do.

1084
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:26,835
What's that?

1085
01:21:27,309 --> 01:21:28,742
Talk me out of it.

1086
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,711
- No, you don't!
- Oh, no!

1087
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:34,248
Now, wait a minute.

1088
01:22:35,144 --> 01:22:36,736
I've got another idea.

1089
01:22:36,812 --> 01:22:39,440
Do you think it'll be polite,
dropping in like this?

1090
01:22:39,515 --> 01:22:40,504
Come on.

1091
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,744
Where do we go now?

1092
01:23:16,151 --> 01:23:17,049
Yeah.

1093
01:23:18,987 --> 01:23:20,011
There!

1094
01:23:29,898 --> 01:23:32,799
Wait! We'd better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

1095
01:23:32,868 --> 01:23:33,857
It's us!

1096
01:23:34,069 --> 01:23:36,094
Yes, it's me!

1097
01:23:36,371 --> 01:23:37,838
She's locked me in!

1098
01:23:37,906 --> 01:23:40,932
It's her. We gotta get her out!
Open the door!

1099
01:23:41,009 --> 01:23:42,977
Hurry! Please, hurry!

1100
01:23:43,112 --> 01:23:45,046
The hourglass is almost empty!

1101
01:23:45,114 --> 01:23:46,206
Stand back!

1102
01:24:02,998 --> 01:24:04,226
Toto! Toto!

1103
01:24:04,299 --> 01:24:06,267
- Did they hurt you?
- I knew you'd come!

1104
01:24:06,335 --> 01:24:07,597
I knew you would!

1105
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:09,864
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!

1106
01:24:21,817 --> 01:24:23,375
Going so soon?

1107
01:24:23,752 --> 01:24:25,447
I wouldn't hear of it.

1108
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:29,553
Why, my little party's just beginning.

1109
01:24:29,658 --> 01:24:31,956
Trapped! Trapped like mice, rats!

1110
01:24:40,969 --> 01:24:43,563
That's right. Don't hurt them right away.

1111
01:24:44,072 --> 01:24:46,700
We'll let them think about it a little first.

1112
01:24:57,619 --> 01:25:00,053
Seize them! Stop them, you fools!

1113
01:25:00,122 --> 01:25:03,285
Stop them! Seize them! Seize them!

1114
01:25:13,268 --> 01:25:15,293
There they go! Now we've got them!

1115
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:17,770
Half you go this way, half you go that way!

1116
01:25:17,839 --> 01:25:19,101
Hurry! Hurry!

1117
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:28,282
Where do we go now?

1118
01:25:28,984 --> 01:25:30,645
This way, come on!

1119
01:25:38,293 --> 01:25:39,419
Back! Back!

1120
01:25:58,146 --> 01:25:59,135
Well!

1121
01:25:59,982 --> 01:26:02,746
Ring around the rosie!
A pocket full of spears!

1122
01:26:02,851 --> 01:26:05,376
Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?

1123
01:26:05,654 --> 01:26:09,818
The last to go will see
the first three go before her!

1124
01:26:11,393 --> 01:26:13,293
And her mangy little dog, too!

1125
01:26:21,503 --> 01:26:23,664
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?

1126
01:26:23,739 --> 01:26:25,832
No! No! No!

1127
01:26:26,008 --> 01:26:29,034
Help! I'm burning! I'm burning!

1128
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:31,172
Don't throw that water!

1129
01:26:33,548 --> 01:26:35,948
You cursed brat! Look what you've done!

1130
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:38,144
I'm melting! Melting!

1131
01:26:39,221 --> 01:26:41,348
What a world! What a world!

1132
01:26:41,423 --> 01:26:46,258
Who would have thought a good little girl
could destroy my beautiful wickedness?

1133
01:26:47,095 --> 01:26:49,222
Look out! Look out!

1134
01:26:49,865 --> 01:26:50,957
I'm going.

1135
01:27:07,683 --> 01:27:09,810
She's dead. You've killed her.

1136
01:27:09,885 --> 01:27:12,752
I didn't mean to kill her, really I didn't.

1137
01:27:14,389 --> 01:27:16,220
It's just that he was on fire!

1138
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:18,851
Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1139
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,418
Hail! Hail to Dorothy!
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1140
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:24,392
The broom!

1141
01:27:24,466 --> 01:27:25,490
May we have it?

1142
01:27:25,567 --> 01:27:27,501
Please. And take it with you.

1143
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:29,068
Thank you so much!

1144
01:27:29,538 --> 01:27:32,735
Now we can go back to the Wizard
and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead!

1145
01:27:32,808 --> 01:27:34,435
The Wicked Witch is dead!

1146
01:27:34,509 --> 01:27:36,636
<i>Can I believe my eyes?</i>

1147
01:27:37,179 --> 01:27:39,044
<i>Why have you come back?</i>

1148
01:27:41,149 --> 01:27:44,084
Please, sir. We've done what you told us.

1149
01:27:44,386 --> 01:27:47,822
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

1150
01:27:47,889 --> 01:27:49,220
We melted her.

1151
01:27:50,559 --> 01:27:52,925
<i>You liquidated her, eh?</i>

1152
01:27:53,462 --> 01:27:54,861
<i>Very resourceful!</i>

1153
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:59,560
Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep
your promise to us, if you please, sir.

1154
01:27:59,701 --> 01:28:02,499
<i>Not so fast! Not so fast!</i>

1155
01:28:03,205 --> 01:28:05,901
<i>I'll have to give the matter a little thought!</i>

1156
01:28:06,007 --> 01:28:08,498
<i>Go away, and come back tomorrow!</i>

1157
01:28:08,944 --> 01:28:09,968
Tomorrow?

1158
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:12,674
But I want to go home now!

1159
01:28:13,548 --> 01:28:15,413
You've had plenty of time already!

1160
01:28:15,484 --> 01:28:16,382
Yeah!

1161
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:19,978
<i>Do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerful Oz!</i>

1162
01:28:20,822 --> 01:28:22,881
<i>I said, "Come back tomorrow!"</i>

1163
01:28:24,025 --> 01:28:24,092
If you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises!

1164
01:28:24,092 --> 01:28:27,118
If you were really great and powerful,
you'd keep your promises!

1165
01:28:27,195 --> 01:28:30,494
<i>Do you presume to criticize the great Oz?</i>

1166
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:33,363
<i>You ungrateful creatures!</i>

1167
01:28:33,635 --> 01:28:37,435
<i>Think yourselves lucky
that I'm giving you audience tomorrow...</i>

1168
01:28:37,672 --> 01:28:40,197
<i>... instead of 20 years from now!</i>

1169
01:28:42,244 --> 01:28:44,508
<i>The great Oz has spoken!</i>

1170
01:28:46,782 --> 01:28:50,013
<i>Pay no attention to that man
behind the curtain.</i>

1171
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:53,882
<i>The great Oz has spoken!</i>

1172
01:28:54,322 --> 01:28:55,516
Who are you?

1173
01:28:56,691 --> 01:28:58,625
<i>I am the great and powerful...</i>

1174
01:28:58,727 --> 01:29:00,456
...Wizard of Oz.

1175
01:29:00,529 --> 01:29:01,553
You are?

1176
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:03,697
I don't believe you!

1177
01:29:03,799 --> 01:29:07,200
No, I'm afraid it's true.
There's no other wizard except me.

1178
01:29:07,369 --> 01:29:08,495
You humbug!

1179
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:09,537
Yeah!

1180
01:29:10,138 --> 01:29:13,107
Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.

1181
01:29:14,543 --> 01:29:16,306
You're a very bad man!

1182
01:29:17,546 --> 01:29:19,980
No, my dear. I'm a very good man.

1183
01:29:20,081 --> 01:29:23,016
I'm just a very bad wizard.

1184
01:29:23,819 --> 01:29:25,946
What about the heart
that you promised Tin Man?

1185
01:29:26,054 --> 01:29:28,386
And the courage
that you promised Cowardly Lion?

1186
01:29:28,457 --> 01:29:29,947
And Scarecrow's brain?

1187
01:29:30,025 --> 01:29:34,189
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1188
01:29:34,362 --> 01:29:37,388
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

1189
01:29:37,466 --> 01:29:40,492
...or slinks through slimy seas has a brain!

1190
01:29:40,802 --> 01:29:43,134
Back where I come from
we have universities...

1191
01:29:43,205 --> 01:29:46,800
...seats of great learning, where men go
to become great thinkers.

1192
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:49,340
When they come out,
they think deep thoughts...

1193
01:29:49,411 --> 01:29:51,345
...with no more brains than you have.

1194
01:29:51,413 --> 01:29:54,814
But they have one thing you haven't got:
A diploma!

1195
01:29:55,283 --> 01:29:59,447
Therefore, by virtue of the authority
vested in me...

1196
01:29:59,654 --> 01:30:03,351
<i>...by the Universitatus Committeeatum
E Pluribus Unum...</i>

1197
01:30:03,692 --> 01:30:05,922
...I hereby confer upon you...

1198
01:30:06,027 --> 01:30:08,518
...the honorary degree of Th.D.

1199
01:30:09,764 --> 01:30:10,696
"Th.D."?

1200
01:30:10,765 --> 01:30:13,461
Yeah, that's "Doctor of Thinkology."

1201
01:30:13,668 --> 01:30:17,035
"The sum of the square roots
of any two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1202
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:19,903
"...is equal to the square root
of the remaining side."

1203
01:30:21,142 --> 01:30:22,404
Joy! Rapture!

1204
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:24,376
I've got a brain!

1205
01:30:24,613 --> 01:30:26,342
How can I ever thank you enough?

1206
01:30:26,414 --> 01:30:31,181
Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend,
you are a victim of disorganized thinking.

1207
01:30:31,286 --> 01:30:33,345
You're under the unfortunate delusion...

1208
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:36,652
...that simply because you run away
from danger you have no courage.

1209
01:30:36,725 --> 01:30:39,387
You are confusing courage with wisdom.

1210
01:30:39,461 --> 01:30:43,227
Back where I come from we have men
who are called heroes.

1211
01:30:43,632 --> 01:30:46,658
Once a year they take their fortitude
out of mothballs...

1212
01:30:46,735 --> 01:30:49,295
...and parade it down the main street
of the city.

1213
01:30:49,371 --> 01:30:51,703
And they have no more courage
than you have.

1214
01:30:51,773 --> 01:30:54,674
But they have one thing
that you haven't got:

1215
01:30:55,176 --> 01:30:56,165
A medal!

1216
01:30:56,978 --> 01:31:00,277
Therefore, for meritorious conduct...

1217
01:31:00,749 --> 01:31:05,345
...extraordinary valor, conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches...

1218
01:31:05,453 --> 01:31:07,853
...I award you the Triple Cross.

1219
01:31:08,557 --> 01:31:11,685
You are now a member
of the Legion of Courage!

1220
01:31:16,131 --> 01:31:18,031
Shucks, folks, I'm speechless!

1221
01:31:19,134 --> 01:31:22,934
As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart!

1222
01:31:23,204 --> 01:31:26,071
You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

1223
01:31:26,141 --> 01:31:30,407
Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

1224
01:31:31,212 --> 01:31:32,941
But I still want one.

1225
01:31:33,582 --> 01:31:37,643
Back where I come from there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds.

1226
01:31:37,852 --> 01:31:39,843
They are called...

1227
01:31:41,656 --> 01:31:44,989
...good-deed-doers and their hearts are
no bigger than yours.

1228
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:48,723
But they have one thing you haven't got:
A testimonial!

1229
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:52,293
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness...

1230
01:31:52,367 --> 01:31:55,336
...I take pleasure at this time
in presenting you...

1231
01:31:55,403 --> 01:31:58,702
...with a small token of our esteem
and affection.

1232
01:31:59,174 --> 01:32:01,540
And remember, my sentimental friend...

1233
01:32:02,143 --> 01:32:05,112
...that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

1234
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:08,105
...but by how much you are loved
by others.

1235
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:13,847
It ticks! Listen!

1236
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:15,820
Look, it ticks!

1237
01:32:16,992 --> 01:32:18,550
Read what my medal says.

1238
01:32:18,627 --> 01:32:19,457
"Courage"!

1239
01:32:19,527 --> 01:32:21,927
Ain't it the truth? Ain't it the truth?

1240
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:23,922
They're all wonderful.

1241
01:32:25,233 --> 01:32:27,599
- What about Dorothy?
- Yes, how about Dorothy?

1242
01:32:28,436 --> 01:32:30,495
- Dorothy next!
- Yes, Dorothy.

1243
01:32:30,572 --> 01:32:33,541
I don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

1244
01:32:34,309 --> 01:32:36,573
You force me into a cataclysmic decision.

1245
01:32:36,645 --> 01:32:40,843
The only way to get Dorothy back to
Kansas is for me to take her there myself!

1246
01:32:42,484 --> 01:32:44,008
Will you? Could you?

1247
01:32:46,187 --> 01:32:48,485
Are you a clever enough wizard
to manage it?

1248
01:32:48,556 --> 01:32:52,549
Child, you cut me to the quick!
I'm an old Kansas man myself...

1249
01:32:52,727 --> 01:32:55,696
...born and bred in the heart
of the western wilderness...

1250
01:32:55,764 --> 01:32:57,789
...premier balloonist par excellence...

1251
01:32:57,866 --> 01:33:01,097
...for the Miracle Wonderland
Carnival Company. Until one day...

1252
01:33:01,169 --> 01:33:04,866
...while performing spectacular feats
of stratospheric skill...

1253
01:33:05,006 --> 01:33:09,807
...never before attempted by civilized man,
an unfortunate phenomenon occurred.

1254
01:33:10,078 --> 01:33:12,205
The balloon failed to return to the fair.

1255
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:13,076
It did?

1256
01:33:13,148 --> 01:33:14,479
Weren't you frightened?

1257
01:33:14,549 --> 01:33:18,246
Frightened? You are talking to a man
who has laughed in the face of death...

1258
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:21,482
...sneered at doom
and chuckled at catastrophe.

1259
01:33:21,656 --> 01:33:23,021
I was petrified.

1260
01:33:23,191 --> 01:33:26,388
Then suddenly the wind changed
and the balloon floated down...

1261
01:33:26,461 --> 01:33:30,955
...into the heart of this noble city
where I was instantly acclaimed Oz...

1262
01:33:31,066 --> 01:33:33,193
...the First Wizard Deluxe!

1263
01:33:33,768 --> 01:33:36,737
Times being what they were,
I accepted the job...

1264
01:33:36,971 --> 01:33:40,737
...retaining my balloon against the advent
of a quick getaway.

1265
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:45,436
And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy,
you and I will return...

1266
01:33:45,513 --> 01:33:47,947
<i>...to the land of "e pluribus unum"!</i>

1267
01:34:02,397 --> 01:34:06,197
This is positively the finest exhibition
ever to be shown.

1268
01:34:07,035 --> 01:34:09,265
Yes, well, be that as it may...

1269
01:34:09,337 --> 01:34:13,034
<i>...I, your Wizard per ardua et alta...</i>

1270
01:34:13,241 --> 01:34:18,440
...am about to embark upon a hazardous
and technically unexplainable journey...

1271
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:21,305
...into the outer stratosphere!

1272
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:30,353
To confer, converse and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards.

1273
01:34:30,792 --> 01:34:34,353
And I hereby decree that until what time...

1274
01:34:34,529 --> 01:34:38,295
...if any, that I return, the Scarecrow...

1275
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:43,560
...by virtue of his highly superior brains,
shall rule in my stead...

1276
01:34:43,938 --> 01:34:48,375
...assisted by the Tin Man,
by virtue of his magnificent heart...

1277
01:34:48,743 --> 01:34:52,304
...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage!

1278
01:34:52,747 --> 01:34:55,238
Obey them as you would me.

1279
01:34:55,316 --> 01:34:56,544
Thank you.

1280
01:34:59,187 --> 01:35:00,154
Toto!

1281
01:35:00,221 --> 01:35:01,586
Come back! Toto!

1282
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:04,520
Don't go without me! I'll be right back!

1283
01:35:04,592 --> 01:35:05,991
Stop that dog!

1284
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:10,497
This is highly irregular procedure!
This is absolutely unprecedented!

1285
01:35:10,565 --> 01:35:11,862
Ruined my exit!

1286
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,161
Come back! Come back!

1287
01:35:14,302 --> 01:35:16,702
Don't go without me! Please, come back!

1288
01:35:16,971 --> 01:35:19,769
I can't come back!
I don't know how it works!

1289
01:35:20,408 --> 01:35:21,670
Goodbye, folks!

1290
01:35:21,943 --> 01:35:23,001
Goodbye!

1291
01:35:27,482 --> 01:35:29,006
Now I'll never get home!

1292
01:35:31,152 --> 01:35:32,983
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1293
01:35:33,555 --> 01:35:34,920
We all love you.

1294
01:35:35,523 --> 01:35:37,491
We don't want you to go.

1295
01:35:38,092 --> 01:35:39,855
That's very kind of you...

1296
01:35:40,562 --> 01:35:42,894
...but this could never be like Kansas.

1297
01:35:43,932 --> 01:35:47,629
Auntie Em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now.

1298
01:35:48,436 --> 01:35:50,666
Scarecrow, what am I going to do?

1299
01:35:52,941 --> 01:35:53,908
Look!

1300
01:35:54,642 --> 01:35:56,667
Here's someone who can help you!

1301
01:36:30,078 --> 01:36:34,412
- Will you help me? Can you help me?
- You don't need to be helped any longer.

1302
01:36:34,482 --> 01:36:37,474
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1303
01:36:37,685 --> 01:36:38,743
I have?

1304
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:40,549
Why didn't you tell her before?

1305
01:36:40,622 --> 01:36:44,490
Because she wouldn't have believed me.
She had to learn it for herself.

1306
01:36:44,726 --> 01:36:46,785
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1307
01:36:50,632 --> 01:36:55,592
I think that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1308
01:36:56,704 --> 01:37:00,800
And it's that if I ever go looking
for my heart's desire again...

1309
01:37:01,509 --> 01:37:04,239
...I won't look any further
than my own backyard...

1310
01:37:05,079 --> 01:37:07,070
...because if it isn't there...

1311
01:37:07,582 --> 01:37:09,982
...I never really lost it to begin with.

1312
01:37:10,852 --> 01:37:12,080
Is that right?

1313
01:37:12,453 --> 01:37:14,045
That's all it is!

1314
01:37:14,122 --> 01:37:17,353
But that's so easy!
I should have thought of it for you.

1315
01:37:17,425 --> 01:37:21,259
- I should have felt it in my heart.
- No. She had to find it out for herself.

1316
01:37:21,329 --> 01:37:24,594
Now those magic slippers
will take you home in two seconds!

1317
01:37:24,732 --> 01:37:26,700
- Toto, too?
- Toto, too.

1318
01:37:27,735 --> 01:37:29,498
- Now?
- Whenever you wish.

1319
01:37:29,904 --> 01:37:33,305
Oh, dear, that's too wonderful to be true!

1320
01:37:35,276 --> 01:37:38,939
It's going to be so hard to say goodbye.

1321
01:37:40,081 --> 01:37:41,548
I love you all, too.

1322
01:37:44,652 --> 01:37:46,017
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1323
01:37:47,588 --> 01:37:48,680
Don't cry.

1324
01:37:49,424 --> 01:37:51,187
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1325
01:37:53,127 --> 01:37:55,152
Here. Here's your oilcan.

1326
01:37:57,799 --> 01:37:58,788
Goodbye.

1327
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:02,063
Now I know I've got a heart
'cause it's breaking.

1328
01:38:06,107 --> 01:38:07,472
Goodbye, Lion.

1329
01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:09,742
You know, I know it isn't right...

1330
01:38:09,811 --> 01:38:13,406
...but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help...

1331
01:38:13,648 --> 01:38:15,741
...before you found your courage.

1332
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:19,650
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1333
01:38:25,159 --> 01:38:27,684
I think I'll miss you most of all.

1334
01:38:33,167 --> 01:38:34,566
Are you ready now?

1335
01:38:34,736 --> 01:38:35,760
Yes.

1336
01:38:37,905 --> 01:38:39,304
Say goodbye, Toto.

1337
01:38:42,744 --> 01:38:44,439
Yes, I'm ready now.

1338
01:38:44,712 --> 01:38:49,046
Then close your eyes and tap your heels
together three times.

1339
01:38:51,686 --> 01:38:53,415
And think to yourself:

1340
01:38:53,988 --> 01:38:59,426
"There's no place like home.
There's no place like home."

1341
01:39:00,728 --> 01:39:03,219
There's no place like home.

1342
01:39:04,298 --> 01:39:06,789
There's no place like home.

1343
01:39:07,735 --> 01:39:10,226
There's no place like home.

1344
01:39:11,272 --> 01:39:13,763
There's no place like home.

1345
01:39:14,809 --> 01:39:16,800
There's no place like home.

1346
01:39:20,548 --> 01:39:22,539
There's no place like home.

1347
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:25,742
There's no place like home.

1348
01:39:28,022 --> 01:39:29,046
Wake up, honey.

1349
01:39:29,123 --> 01:39:31,114
There's no place like home.

1350
01:39:32,026 --> 01:39:34,017
There's no place like home.

1351
01:39:36,597 --> 01:39:38,087
There's no place...

1352
01:39:41,102 --> 01:39:44,299
Dorothy! Dorothy, dear.
It's Aunt Em, darling.

1353
01:39:44,705 --> 01:39:46,832
Auntie Em, it's you!

1354
01:39:47,442 --> 01:39:49,535
Hello, there! Anybody home?

1355
01:39:49,644 --> 01:39:53,978
I just dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big...

1356
01:39:54,615 --> 01:39:56,515
Well, she seems all right now!

1357
01:39:56,751 --> 01:40:00,653
She got quite a bump on the head.
We thought for a minute she'd leave us.

1358
01:40:00,721 --> 01:40:03,554
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry.
That's just the trouble.

1359
01:40:03,624 --> 01:40:05,819
And I tried to get back for days and days.

1360
01:40:05,893 --> 01:40:09,488
There, there, lie quiet now.
You just had a bad dream.

1361
01:40:09,897 --> 01:40:10,829
Sure.

1362
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:14,100
Remember me, your old pal, Hunk?

1363
01:40:15,403 --> 01:40:17,428
And me, Hickory?

1364
01:40:18,072 --> 01:40:20,097
You couldn't forget my face, could you?

1365
01:40:20,174 --> 01:40:23,473
No. But it wasn't a dream. It was a place.

1366
01:40:23,978 --> 01:40:27,573
And you, and you, and you,
and you were there.

1367
01:40:29,917 --> 01:40:31,908
But you couldn't have been, could you?

1368
01:40:31,986 --> 01:40:34,113
We dream lots of silly things when we...

1369
01:40:34,188 --> 01:40:37,646
No, Aunt Em, this was a real,
truly live place.

1370
01:40:38,426 --> 01:40:41,327
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1371
01:40:41,395 --> 01:40:44,523
...but most of it was beautiful.
But just the same...

1372
01:40:44,665 --> 01:40:47,828
...all I kept saying to everybody was,
"I want to go home!"

1373
01:40:47,902 --> 01:40:49,767
And they sent me home.

1374
01:40:51,739 --> 01:40:53,764
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1375
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:55,843
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1376
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:58,140
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1377
01:40:58,479 --> 01:40:59,468
Home!

1378
01:40:59,847 --> 01:41:02,941
And this is my room, and you're all here!

1379
01:41:03,484 --> 01:41:08,148
And I'm not going to leave here ever,
ever again, because I love you all!

1380
01:41:10,424 --> 01:41:14,155
Auntie Em, there's no place like home!
