1
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,176
l am a stone.

2
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,892
l do not move.

3
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,291
Very slowly, l put snow in my mouth.

4
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,298
Then he won't see my breath.

5
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,132
l take my time.

6
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,776
l let him come closer.

7
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,215
l have only one bullet.

8
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,611
l aim at his eye very gently.

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,657
My finger presses on the trigger.

10
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,817
l do not tremble.

11
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,818
l have no fear.

12
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,537
l'm a big boy now.

13
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,134
Ready Vassili?

14
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,174
Now Vassili. Fire!

15
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,693
Fire, Vassili!

16
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,576
All civilians, get off!

17
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,049
Make way, let the civilians off.

18
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,336
This is a military convoy.

19
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,333
No one stays onboard,
but our valiant soldiers.

20
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,374
Convoy to Stalingrad.

21
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,771
Only for the soldiers of the Red Army.

22
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,212
Autumn, 1 942.

23
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,850
Europe lies crushed
beneath the Nazi jackboot.

24
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,816
The German Third Reich
is at the height of its power.

25
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,699
Hitler's armies are charging
through the heart of the Soviet Union

26
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,657
towards the oil fields of Asia.

27
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,178
One last obstacle remains.

28
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,738
A city on the Volga where the fate
of the world is being decided.

29
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,811
Stalingrad.

30
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,653
The Army and all citizens
of the Soviet Union

31
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,130
must defend every inch of Soviet soil.

32
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,294
Glorious comrades, Stalin has ordered
not another step backwards.

33
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,055
Let us go forwards, comrades.
Not a step backwards.

34
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,210
Listen to these letters sent by Russian
mothers to their sons on the front.

35
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,096
Volodya, our child,
l know that it is for our motherland...

36
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,457
...it is for our motherland
that you are giving your life.

37
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,772
Everyone here knows
that you will not fall back.

38
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,970
Everyone here is proud of you.

39
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,093
Your father is dead. Your brothers
are dead. Avenge us on the fascists.

40
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,652
Get in the boat!

41
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,937
Get back or l'll shoot.
Get back from the rails.

42
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,491
Over here, stretcher.

43
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,455
The one with the rifle shoots.

44
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,337
The one without follows him.

45
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,572
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

46
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,575
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

47
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,734
The one with the rifle shoots.

48
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,971
The one without follows him.

49
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,609
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

50
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,814
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

51
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,858
Soldiers of the glorious Red Army,

52
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,615
from now on it is either victory or death.

53
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,215
- Those who retreat...will be shot.
- l need a rifle.

54
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,736
There will be no
mercy for cowards and traitors.

55
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,254
lt's hopeless, comrades. Get back.

56
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,453
Fall back! Fall back!

57
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,293
lt's no good.
Get back. Get back.

58
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:50,008
ln the name of the Soviet Union,
not a step backwards, or we shoot.

59
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,771
- No retreat. Not a step back.
- No mercy.

60
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,454
- Deserters will be shot.
- Fire!

61
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,889
No mercy for cowards.

62
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,179
Russians, surrender.

63
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,296
You will see your home again.

64
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,690
This is not your war.

65
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,855
Join your German comrades.

66
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,731
They understand your suffering and will
care more for you than your own officers,

67
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,573
who are only sending you to your death.

68
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,573
The Third Reich is not your enemy.

69
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,370
The enemy is bloodthirsty Stalin
and his Bolshevik gang.

70
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,894
Fire!

71
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,496
Get his coat, comrade Commissar.

72
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,529
With your permission,
comrade Commissar.

73
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:31,053
- Which one should l aim at first?
- You should wait...till there's an explosion.

74
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,895
- Do you know how to shoot?
- A little.

75
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,656
Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.

76
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,458
Thank you, comrade Commissar.

77
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:57,048
Danilov. Political officer,
2nd class, 21st lnfantry.

78
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:25,415
On this day, September 20th 1 942,
a young shepherd boy from the Urals...

79
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,211
...arrived in the city of Stalingrad
on the banks of the Volga.

80
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,019
His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

81
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,610
Like thousands before him
he came to answer comrade Stalin's call.

82
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,976
Armed only with a rifle,
he quickly made the fascist invader realise

83
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,531
that from now on he would be punished
for every step he took in the motherland,

84
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,010
that from here on the only way was back.

85
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,893
What do you think?

86
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,458
l think Comrade Commissar
is being over generous.

87
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,215
By order of comrade Stalin,
no civilian can leave the city.

88
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,979
Get back there!

89
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,290
Stand away, or we will open fire.

90
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,169
Make way for comrade Stalin's envoy.

91
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,217
l carried out my orders.

92
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,249
l sent in all of my boys.

93
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,135
But the Germans engulfed us.

94
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,008
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks.

95
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,093
- And we, what did l have ?
- The sacred duty to resist.

96
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,536
l have to report to the boss.

97
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,575
Perhaps you would prefer
to avoid the red tape.

98
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,370
My name is Nikita Sergeievich Kruschev.

99
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,654
l've come to take things in hand here.

100
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,495
This city is not Kursk.

101
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,335
Nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

102
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,776
This city is Stalingrad.

103
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,374
Stalingrad!

104
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,135
This city bears the name of the boss.

105
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,095
lt's more than a city, it's a symbol.

106
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,688
lf the Germans capture this city,

107
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,254
the entire country will collapse.

108
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,250
l want our boys to raise their heads.

109
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,171
l want them to act like they have balls.

110
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,696
l want them to stop shitting their pants.

111
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,688
That's your job

112
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,013
As political officers, l'm counting on you.

113
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,895
You, what's your suggestion?

114
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,258
Shoot all the other generals who have
retreated and their chiefs of staff too.

115
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,290
Make some examples.
Deport the families of the deserters...

116
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,178
Give them hope.

117
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,610
Here, the men's only choices
are between German bullets and ours.

118
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,931
But there's another way.
A way of courage.

119
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,295
A way of love of the motherland.

120
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,770
We must publish the army newspaper
again and tell magnificent stories,

121
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,931
stories that exalt sacrifice, bravery.

122
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,695
We must make them believe in a victory

123
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,614
We must give them hope,
pride, a desire to fight.

124
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,730
We need to make examples,
but examples to follow.

125
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,455
What we need are heroes.

126
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,616
Do you know any heroes around here?

127
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,731
Yes, comrade.
l know one.

128
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,297
That's me. Vassili Zaitsev.

129
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,413
No. You're not dreaming.
lt's your name.

130
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,411
We made the front page.

131
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,572
They haven't changed a word.

132
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,260
Do you have any idea what this means?

133
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,736
lt's not the back page,
not the second page. lt's the front page.

134
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,856
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere,

135
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,217
in the Caucasus,
in the Crimea, even in the Urals.

136
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,168
Tomorrow morning,
Stalin himself will be sitting at breakfast

137
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,774
reading my words
memorising your name.

138
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,533
We're famous Vassili.
Kruschev loved the article.

139
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,339
He's promoted me to the general staff.

140
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,968
And you, to Sniper Division.

141
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,212
- Well, that's good.
- lt's very good.

142
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,848
- lt's very good. lt's great!
- lt's great!

143
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,569
lt's great for both of us
because we did it together.

144
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,492
Admittedly, l did all the hard work.

145
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,890
- You're very lucky l can't fight back.
- Why's that?

146
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,291
Kruschev told me to make sure nothing
happens to you. You're too important.

147
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,770
- l'm too valuable.
- Yes. Careful of my glasses, they're new.

148
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,293
Sorry, sir.

149
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,089
l'm famous. We're famous.

150
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,458
Vassili, the young shepherd from the
Urals, killed his 1 2th German officer today.

151
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,292
Today Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd...

152
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,813
One more colonel shot by...

153
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,413
He is an example to us all.

154
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,172
Today Vassili Zaitsev
killed his 32nd general.

155
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,656
More and more men and women from
the small branches of our armed forces

156
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,018
volunteer to join the Sniper Division
and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.

157
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,853
l am a stone.

158
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,132
l am a stone.

159
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,652
l breathe slowly.

160
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,217
l aim at the eye.

161
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,412
So it is you.

162
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,376
The great Vassili Zaitsev.

163
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,289
My mother makes the best potatoes
and bacon in town.

164
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,654
Sounds good.

165
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,778
When she sees you,
she won't believe her eyes.

166
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,459
- How many today?
- Only two.

167
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,414
And the last one,
why didn't you shoot him?

168
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,539
He was only a foot soldier.
lt wasn't worth giving away my position.

169
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,053
Bless you.

170
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,171
We know how much we owe you.

171
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,771
We pray for you everyday.

172
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,212
Every evening we listen to them
talk about you on Radio Moscow.

173
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,977
You've certainly managed well down here.

174
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,416
My parents used to store furniture
down here before the war.

175
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,458
Sacha, drop that right now.

176
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,099
lt's loaded.

177
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,058
- This way comrade Commissar.
- Thank you, comrade.

178
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,934
Good evening.

179
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,252
Comrade Zaitsev.

180
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,657
My God, where does
all this mail come from?

181
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,935
From all over the country,
Mrs Filipov, from all over.

182
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,331
This one's from the workers of the Kuzbas.
They want to name their mine after Vassili.

183
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,491
Right lets' start with the miners.

184
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,175
Come on, let's get to work.

185
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,654
Dear comrades from the Kuzbas,

186
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,732
l thank you for your letter of praise.

187
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,650
R-A-l-S-E.

188
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,097
l hope that l can live up
to your expectations.

189
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,854
A-T-l-O-N-S.

190
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,056
Expectations.

191
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,858
You're interested in German literature,
Mrs Filipov?

192
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,209
lt's all right.
lt's our neighbour.

193
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,569
Tania, we have guests.

194
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,979
l recognise you.

195
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,532
lt's Vassili Zaitsev.

196
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,455
l saw your picture in the paper.
Thank you for everything you're doing.

197
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,936
- And this is his friend, Commissar...?
- Danilov.

198
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,292
Tania's like a daughter to me.

199
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,054
She used to take care of Sacha
when l worked at the factory.

200
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,536
She even taught him German.
These books are hers.

201
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,170
- They're yours?
- She studied German at the university.

202
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,376
- Which university?
- Moscow.

203
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,569
- Shouldn't we...
- Yes, let's continue.

204
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,611
Your offer to name your mine after me is...

205
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,299
a great honour.

206
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:41,058
- H-O-N.
- Yes, l know, honour.

207
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,209
Shouldn't we try and make the point
that l'm not the only one fighting?

208
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,977
That's an excellent idea.
We can take it even further though.

209
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:03,892
Your battle for the production of coal
is...as worthy as mine.

210
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,293
There's no 'K' in coal.

211
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,257
Just one 'L'.

212
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,495
Tell me if l'm going too fast.

213
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,290
No, you're not going too fast.
ls there any other improvements.

214
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,658
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

215
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,608
We should carry on.
We're not tired. Thank you, Mrs Filipov.

216
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,693
These people took the trouble
to write to us.

217
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,055
Tomorrow we may not be around
to write back.

218
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,731
l was expecting someone...else.

219
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,619
Certainly not someone so prestigious.

220
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,695
l imagine you have your reasons
for getting involved in this hellish situation.

221
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,093
My army is not designed
for this kind of fighting.

222
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,696
Yesterday, yet again,
l had to promote 25 sergeants

223
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,170
to replace the officers shot down
by their sharpshooters.

224
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,089
Those snipers are demoralising
my people.

225
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:46,333
This city...is no more
than a heap of ruins.

226
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,650
But the Fhrer's persisting.

227
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,497
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

228
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,293
We should trust the Fhrer's instinct.

229
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,535
He always managed to lead us to victory.

230
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,088
We shall be back home for Christmas.

231
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,376
How are you going to go about
finding this young Russian?

232
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,939
l'll fix it so that he's the one who finds me.

233
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,297
Vassili! Come on!
Time to get up.

234
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,769
They have a problem
in the department store. They need us.

235
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,809
Look, Vassili, he's hiding
in the department store, over there.

236
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,897
So far this morning, he's knocked off
five officers plus two machine gunners.

237
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,612
Look! Third floor.

238
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,173
Fourth window from the left.

239
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,650
Fourth window...from the left.

240
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,650
- See him?
- Yeah, l see him.

241
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,331
- You got him!
- Great shot.

242
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,693
Let's go get his dogtag.

243
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,019
Goodbye, comrade Commissar.

244
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,330
Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs Filipov.

245
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,771
- You can borrow whatever you like.
- What would they say at headquarters

246
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,932
if l came back with an armful
Goethe and Schiller?

247
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,499
There's some Marx too.

248
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,455
You were assigned to civil defence
at the 1 2th district?

249
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,338
No, l volunteered.

250
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,173
lt's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

251
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,456
Comrade Kruschev was telling me
just yesterday

252
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,850
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

253
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,532
l can't. Our militia in this neighbourhood
is already short of men.

254
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,498
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for everyone that speaks German.

255
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,412
l'd rather stay and fight.

256
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,492
Serving headquarters is fighting.
You'd be more useful there.

257
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,974
You stay here.
You cover us. We go.

258
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,695
Take care.

259
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,812
Ludmilla, come on.

260
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,173
Take the stairway.

261
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,379
- lt's a trap.
- l know.

262
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,495
Move back.

263
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,695
He's still here.

264
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,619
- They're coming straight for us.
- Ludmilla, stay where you are.

265
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,657
He's over there somewhere.

266
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,414
We've got to get out of here.

267
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,214
- We have to get out of here.
- Just stay where you are.

268
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,977
What are we gonna do?

269
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,335
Ludmilla, stay where you are.

270
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,578
Fuck this, l'm going.

271
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,058
Ludmilla, no!

272
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,138
What does this mean?

273
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,613
A shepherd from the Urals
receives a sniper's rifle.

274
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:00,333
A 7.62 3.5 power telescope,
pride of precision of Soviet production.

275
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,334
- l've seen that rifle close up.
- Have you?

276
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,252
l even touched it.

277
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,411
l know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

278
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,980
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today.

279
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,897
And it was my fault.

280
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,413
l'm sure that's not true.

281
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,536
lt was a German sniper.

282
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,975
l walked them right into his trap.

283
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,731
- What else can you tell me?
- He didn't relocate.

284
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,530
A sniper who doesn't relocate isn't normal.

285
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,459
He was very good.

286
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,169
lt wasn't just his shooting,
it was his instinct.

287
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,291
He was a step ahead of me.

288
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,012
That's because
he knows everything about you.

289
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,298
His name is Konig.

290
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,090
Major Konig.
They've sent him here to kill you.

291
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,728
To find you.

292
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,739
We weren't sure
if the information was reliable.

293
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,539
He's come all the way
from Berlin to stop you.

294
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,851
You've caused him so many sleepless
nights, they've sent their top marksman.

295
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,535
- What do we know about him?
- He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

296
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,853
He's director of their sniper school
in Zossen.

297
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,171
Koulikov studied at Zossen
before the war.

298
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,696
He know all his tricks.
From now on he'll go with you everywhere.

299
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,771
A nobleman from Bavaria who hunts deer

300
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,774
against the shepherd boy from the Urals
who poaches wolves.

301
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,817
lt's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

302
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,176
lt's the essence of class struggle.

303
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,058
l'm glad you're so happy.

304
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,217
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

305
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,132
No one shoots like you, Vassili.

306
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,131
She's been transferred.

307
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,093
l'll see if they're ready for you next door.

308
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,050
You look very smart in your new uniform.

309
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,811
Make sure they don't take it back
once you've finished.

310
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,050
They probably will.

311
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,416
l've heard the rumour about the German.

312
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,016
- l wanted to wish you luck.
- Thank you. l'll need it.

313
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,569
From what comrade Danilov tells me
you're going to win.

314
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,295
lt's time.

315
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,619
Vassili, come to my arms.

316
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,017
Put your cap back on.
You look more heroic.

317
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,249
This way, comrade Zaitsev.

318
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,899
l love this little fellow.

319
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,257
ls it true that you volunteered for the front?

320
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,569
How old are you?

321
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,810
Do you know what
this means for our country?

322
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,335
ls it true you killed
your first wolf when you were five?

323
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,536
How many fascists have you killed today?

324
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,692
lt's a sign the Germans
are starting to shit their pants.

325
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,818
Go on, tell us how you are going
to deal with him.

326
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,211
Or rather, no...tell it to the boss.

327
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,336
He likes good hunting stories.

328
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,538
Look at him with pride...
because he's looking at you.

329
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,294
The whole country is looking at you.

330
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,216
Forgive me, forgive me, Grandfather.

331
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,456
So it's not the wolf that chooses
the hunting ground...but the hunter.

332
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,258
And l'm sure your grandfather
taught you that.

333
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,775
Except in this case, l'm the game.

334
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:47,614
However, today what we're going to do
is lure the wolf out of his lair.

335
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,532
To where we want him to be.

336
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,177
You're the one whose life is valuable,
you go first.

337
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,217
No. We take it in turns.

338
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,530
Next time it's your turn to go first.

339
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,697
Then it's you, Volodya.

340
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,531
Son of a bitch!

341
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,450
These are new pants. l just took them
off a captain from the 251st yesterday.

342
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,490
16 months l spent in Germany
at the school in Zossen.

343
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,936
Of course those were the days
when we were friends with the Krauts.

344
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:21,178
When our Joseph and their Adolf
were walking hand in hand.

345
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,135
Near to the wire, 1 16 metres, right?

346
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,375
- 1 55.
- Whatever.

347
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,179
l don't make them send out a repair guy.

348
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,052
Let's relocate.

349
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:16,335
After the Germans invaded us,
it wasn't the same atmosphere anymore.

350
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,212
They threw me in prison.

351
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,410
''What were you doing in Germany?''

352
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:27,493
''Excuse me'', says l, ''but it was comrade
Stalin who sent me there.''

353
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,652
''Don't bring our glorious leader
into your treachery.

354
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:36,017
''Confess, spy bastard, confess.''

355
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,456
There wasn't a sickle
but there was a hammer.

356
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,851
And ''bang'',
it knocked out all, my teeth.

357
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,378
That's right.
Have no illusions.

358
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,657
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

359
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,690
Hey, it's your repair guy.

360
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,058
l got him.

361
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,454
- lt's about soup time, isn't it?
- l'm going.

362
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,453
Well, get a move on, Volodya.

363
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:34,249
And try not to spill it on your way back,
you Marxist bastard.

364
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:51,330
Here's the enemy sniper activity
reported during the past 24 hours.

365
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,090
Two sentries shot
in the train station.

366
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,774
One artillery observer
in the northern sector.

367
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,330
One lieutenant from
the 24th Panzer Division.

368
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,936
Three telephone repair men
in the workers' housing sector.

369
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,013
They also tell me we've just taken
a prisoner who may interest you.

370
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,536
- l hope he's still able to speak.
- Excuse me, sir?

371
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,969
Nothing.

372
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,889
So tell us, Volodya.

373
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,937
Which building is he in?

374
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,458
There is no way l know that.

375
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,771
He moves around all the time.

376
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,693
He jumps...from one to the next.

377
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,409
- On which floor?
- l don't know.

378
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,855
We'll see about that.

379
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,735
Undress him.

380
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,376
Put him in one of our uniforms.

381
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,459
See? They're stubborn.

382
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,895
That's the good thing about the Germans.

383
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,137
You got to admit,
when they get an idea in their heads,

384
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,135
Let's see if our customer has arrived.

385
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,255
You ready?

386
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,376
And now, our famous shepherd
from the Urals,

387
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:58,534
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot,
gets up to make sure he has hit his target.

388
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,337
Major Konig sees him...

389
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,896
...aims for his helmet,

390
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,415
fires, reveals his position,

391
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,138
and is shot in turn.

392
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,649
Except...Major Konig doesn't fire,

393
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,810
because, Major Konig isn't there.

394
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,457
Don't you think that was strange?
That last one?

395
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,771
They sent him out
to get shot like the others.

396
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,419
lt's not natural.

397
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,811
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

398
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,334
No, l was the one who was stupid.

399
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,535
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

400
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,975
lt's like us with the Ukrainians.

401
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,973
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead soldiers.

402
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:14,170
Tomorrow...we'll kill us some generals.

403
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,779
Whose turn is it?

404
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,369
Mine, l think.

405
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:31,096
You're such a cheater.

406
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:37,938
You can't fool Papa Koulikov, oh no.
lt's my turn to go first.

407
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,613
And it's your turn
to get a hole in your breeches.

408
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,889
To victory.

409
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,857
This sniper business
has been dragging on too long.

410
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,818
What's that little fella of yours up to?

411
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,090
He's probing, comrade Kruschev.

412
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:21,299
He's testing the Germans for weaknesses.
He's meticulous in his preparation.

413
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,336
Vodka...is a luxury we have.

414
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,533
Caviar is a luxury we have.

415
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,214
Time is not.

416
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,493
He's aware of that, we both are.

417
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,817
l assure you he will succeed.

418
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,735
Good...
lt seems your destinies are entwined.

419
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,097
Keeping you busy?

420
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,849
l picked this up from the kitchen.
lt's from the reception the other day.

421
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,295
Mrs Filipov might like it.

422
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,850
She'll be thrilled.
lt's very sweet of you.

423
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:31,096
- There's plenty more if you're hungry.
- You're Jewish aren't you?

424
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,458
There's nothing in our religion
that says you can't eat sturgeon.

425
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,939
My father had a premonition
all this would happen.

426
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:43,010
You mean the war?

427
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:46,331
He understood that
the hatred of the Jews ran deep.

428
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,938
He was saving up
to buy some land in Palestine.

429
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,133
He said it was the only land
that we truly belonged in.

430
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,609
The only land we had a duty to defend.

431
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:01,813
He insisted l learnt to use a rifle.

432
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,011
l learnt to shoot.

433
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,011
l know that in times of war
personal feelings should be put aside,

434
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,410
but l have a favour to ask you.

435
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,411
Of course.
Anything you want.

436
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,735
l want to be reassigned.

437
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,290
What's happened, Tania?

438
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,893
He shot him.

439
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:57,334
He shot him even though he jumped first.

440
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,613
Shot him on the run.

441
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:05,129
lt was an impossible shot.
l've never seen anything like it.

442
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,220
You've promised people
a victory l can't deliver.

443
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,339
l don't stand a chance against this man.

444
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,536
You mustn't talk like that, Vassili.

445
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:20,296
What if l told you
we'd found a way to track his moves?

446
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,690
We've got someone, Vassili.

447
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,658
Someone close to him
passing us information.

448
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,459
Next time you will be
one step ahead of him.

449
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,298
l promise.

450
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,096
Now l have a favour to ask.

451
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,698
From me?

452
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,771
lt's about Tania.

453
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,657
Come in.

454
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:08,739
He doesn't know you, but at that moment
you're closer to him than anyone on earth.

455
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,858
You see his face through the sign.

456
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,170
You see whether he shaved or not.

457
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,537
You can see whether he's married
if he's got a wedding ring.

458
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,294
lt's not like firing at a distant shape.

459
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,896
lt's not just a uniform.
lt's a man's face.

460
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,651
Those faces don't go away.

461
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,009
They come back
and they get replaced by more faces.

462
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,774
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

463
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,975
He likes you very much. l think he'd try
anything to change your mind.

464
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,700
Did he tell you why
l asked for the transfer?

465
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,650
This morning a list arrived at headquarters.

466
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,936
lt was a list of civilians
who'd been rounded up

467
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,456
and sent to Germany in a convoy
that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

468
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,335
My parents were amongst them.

469
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,497
After 30 kilometres...

470
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:13,051
the German soldiers stopped the train
and forced everyone out.

471
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:19,418
ln the middle of a bridge,
they bound them together,

472
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,377
two by two.

473
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,729
Mothers with daughters

474
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,016
Husbands and wives.

475
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:31,731
They lined them up against the railing.

476
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,817
Then they fired
a single shot at each pair,

477
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,857
to save bullets.

478
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,539
lt worked.

479
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,898
The bodies of the ones who died
dragged the others under the water.

480
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,376
l know they died together.

481
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,055
They would never have let themselves
be separated.

482
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,011
That's Koulikov's rifle.
lt's a good rifle.

483
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:56,538
l know how he leaves the shelter.
He goes through the tractor factory.

484
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,975
The tractor factory is big.

485
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,934
l know exactly where.

486
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,536
He crawls through a gutter
under a grate where the vats are.

487
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,736
Then he goes out from the workshop.

488
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:12,850
ln between the two
there's a place where he's in the open.

489
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,136
lt's under a long iron foot walk.

490
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,974
Good luck, comrade.

491
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,808
l know exactly where he's waiting for me.

492
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,250
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.

493
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,650
We'll take him out from behind.

494
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,213
We'll get to the other end of the workshop
through these pipes.

495
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,529
Follow me.

496
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,134
You go that way.
l'll go this way.

497
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,694
Shit!

498
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:22,212
- lt's OK.
- You should go back.

499
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,374
No, l'll be all right.

500
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,735
No, you go!

501
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,370
Keep your legs in.

502
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,450
Come on.

503
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:19,252
Comrade Stalin is asking
for one last effort.

504
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,570
The fate of the motherland is at risk.

505
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:26,177
The fate of all those you love and cherish.
lt's for them that we fight today.

506
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:31,132
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans
are throwing everything at us.

507
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,654
lf they're lucky, one in ten of these
soldiers will come back alive.

508
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,618
You're highly educated.
You know languages.

509
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,897
Every intercept you translate
saves hundreds of lives.

510
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:44,894
Every message you decode
kills thousands of theirs.

511
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,778
You have a duty to survive.

512
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:49,295
Vassili was born to fire a gun.
That's what he knows.

513
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,293
You and l were born
for a different purpose.

514
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,696
lf Vassili were here,
he'd tell you the same thing.

515
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,815
Where is he? Where's Vassili?

516
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,293
Keep your head down.

517
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,894
- Tell me where he is.
- Stay into that pipe.

518
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:12,891
Stay in. Get your head in.

519
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,973
Slow down.

520
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,419
Don't shoot.

521
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,892
He's over there.

522
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:47,649
You see the pillar in front of you?

523
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,891
l need you to move round behind it.

524
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,939
Go!

525
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:09,014
Tania, l need you to find
a large piece of glass.

526
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,532
Piece of glass.

527
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,015
You see the kiln?

528
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:19,179
Behind me.

529
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:21,217
To the left of the factory.

530
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,216
- l can't hear you.
- Yes.

531
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,818
Do you see the two louvres?

532
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:39,009
Do you see the one with the broken slat?

533
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:44,089
- Yes.
- This is what l want you to do.

534
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,416
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

535
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:57,138
Three...two...one.

536
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:16,969
Hello, Sacha.

537
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,177
He was right where you said he'd be.

538
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,649
Nearly there.

539
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,089
He's very clever.

540
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,058
Tell me about him.

541
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,652
Why was it his grandfather who taught him
how to shoot and not his father?

542
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:54,575
His father's dead. His mother too.

543
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:02,539
- Does he talk about his father?
- No, he didn't know him.

544
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,498
Did he go to school?

545
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:09,970
He knows how to write.
He answers lots of letters.

546
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,778
- ls it girls who write to him?
- Everyone writes to him.

547
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,256
- ls there a girl he loves in his village?
- Not in his village. Here!

548
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,650
Does she love him?

549
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,051
Yes. Because he's handsome and brave.

550
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:29,814
And she's very beautiful.
She's from my neighbourhood.

551
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,290
She went to the university.
They are handsome together.

552
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:34,779
Later the two of them will get married.

553
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,857
At least, l think so.

554
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:49,331
And you, Sacha,
why are you helping the Germans?

555
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,452
Because they're stronger.
Because they're going to win the war.

556
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,051
And because you like chocolate.

557
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,460
All these people here
know they're gonna die.

558
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,772
So each night when they make
it back, it's a bonus.

559
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,013
Excuse me!

560
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,610
So every cup of tea, every cigarette...

561
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,292
becomes a little celebration.

562
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:37,179
Because for a lot of us,
it may be our last night.

563
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:42,251
lt's just something
you have to accept here.

564
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,494
Everyone has their time.

565
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:52,654
ln the forest the wolf lives for three years...

566
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,132
the donkey for nine.

567
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,452
Sorry, but that's got to be
a proverb from the Urals.

568
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,690
lt makes no sense to me whatsoever!

569
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:06,932
The donkey lives longer
because he's more useful.

570
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,895
Absolute sense!

571
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:12,894
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.
You made it up.

572
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,972
l'm a donkey.

573
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:26,574
People like you and Danilov...
have to survive this.

574
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:30,415
People who've read books,
had an education...

575
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,810
We'll need you when the war's over.

576
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:36,369
And if you survive?

577
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,010
What will the useless
Vassili Zaitsev do then?

578
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:42,136
l want to work in a factory.

579
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,852
My granddad took me to a factory once.

580
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,809
There was this man there.

581
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,813
High up on a foot walk.

582
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,450
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

583
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:02,538
The people who were supervising didn't
really understand what they were doing.

584
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,851
But for him up there, it was simple.
lt was clear.

585
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,892
And l thought, one day...

586
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,531
l could be that man.

587
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,937
Sad to have a dream
you know won't happen.

588
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,736
Why shouldn't it?

589
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,971
You'll outlive us all.

590
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,459
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

591
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,619
1 50 metres stand between
the Germans and the Volga.

592
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,771
Today the whole world is watching
these 1 50 metres.

593
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:58,410
They are what make Stalingrad
the capital...

594
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,011
...of the war.

595
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:08,373
Your friend, Tania.

596
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:14,294
- Have you seen her?
- She stays there with the snipers.

597
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:20,534
Tell the major our sharpshooters
will support the attack on the factory.

598
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,459
Vassili will be there.

599
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:10,134
- l need to talk to you.
- Sure.

600
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,814
You have to stop writing about me.

601
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,251
l won't get him cos l'm not good enough.

602
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,969
Sooner or later he's gonna find me,
he's gonna kill me.

603
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:42,654
l've warned you before not to talk like this.

604
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,373
This time it's different.

605
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:54,208
You've built me up and up
into someone l'm not.

606
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:59,452
l can't carry that weight anymore.
l want to fight.

607
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:03,890
l want to fight, just as a regular soldier.

608
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,088
l understand.

609
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:10,458
The thing is Vassili you're not a regular
soldier, you're an extraordinary soldier.

610
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,736
No. l'm what you've made me.

611
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:16,132
Nothing more.

612
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:23,289
Why are you telling me this now?

613
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,451
What's happened?

614
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:30,968
What's changed?

615
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:37,850
Did you speak to Tania for me?

616
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,975
Well, will she reconsider?

617
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:48,649
l don't know.

618
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:56,213
She should.
She'll be much safer. You know that.

619
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,493
lt'll be easier to get her reassigned
than you.

620
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:02,379
The Germans are preparing another
offensive in the city centre.

621
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,691
The propaganda battle's crucial for morale.
We need you more than ever.

622
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,609
Tell him what you know, Sacha.

623
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:17,055
There was dust on the major's boots.

624
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:19,973
Sacha has the major convinced
he's gone over to the other side.

625
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:25,618
- You know the risks he's taking.
- The dust was yellow.

626
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,418
There's only one place
where there's dust like that.

627
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:31,334
ln the back of the chemical factory,
a big heap along the tracks.

628
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,454
Well done.

629
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,689
Sacha, wait for me outside then.

630
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,697
You had no right to use him.

631
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:57,456
No, l didn't use him, Vassili,
he did it of his own accord.

632
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:01,772
Do you know why?
Because he believes in you.

633
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:12,856
Tomorrow morning we going take back
the chemical factory.

634
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,534
Sacha has informed the major
you'll be there.

635
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,616
So now you know
where you have to wait for him.

636
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,578
-ln the middle of an assault.
- l'm following orders.

637
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:23,971
l suggest you do the same.

638
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:29,369
Now, l'm aware of the risks.
You'll be fine...

639
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:36,495
...comrade.

640
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:05,770
That's the Germans up there.
Yesterday it was the Russians.

641
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,249
We're not very far now.

642
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,696
You're playing a very dangerous game.

643
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,212
l want you to win.

644
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,453
See there?
Keep going along the river.

645
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,895
lt's safe for a while.

646
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:56,295
He's dead.
We found this on his corpse.

647
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:02,138
Your reason
for being here ceases to exist.

648
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,692
Pardon me, Herr General.

649
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,368
l do not believe...

650
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:11,055
There's a plane bound for Berlin
tomorrow evening. You will be on it.

651
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:18,092
Until then l must ask you for your dogtags.

652
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,497
lmagine how Russian propaganda
would profit from your death.

653
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:26,049
lf you fall, you will fall unknown.

654
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,939
You've already had a near miss.

655
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:39,415
Also, please take this war merit cross.

656
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:43,368
lt was awarded posthumously to
a Lieutenant of the 1 16th lnfantry Division,

657
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:46,418
who fell here during the first days
of the battle.

658
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,416
He was my son.

659
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:55,418
lf the landing is captured everything's lost.

660
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,292
Come here.

661
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:04,459
What did l tell you?

662
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:07,088
You've been playing your fiddle too much.

663
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:09,774
lf it's confirmed that he's dead, we're sunk.

664
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:13,408
- Well, you're sunk.
- lt isn't true.

665
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:16,140
lt was intercepted
from their staff headquarters.

666
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:19,656
What do they have to do?
Dangle his body in front of our men?

667
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,014
They're lying.

668
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:23,858
That's good.

669
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:26,250
Very good.

670
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:29,730
Write it then. Vassili Zaitsev is not dead!

671
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:32,175
This is what he had for breakfast
this morning.

672
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,093
This is a picture of him
reading today's newspaper.

673
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:36,409
You're the poet.

674
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:40,217
What? You won't give up the riverbank.

675
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,808
l don't care of you've lost half you're men.

676
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:46,858
Lose the other half or lose yourself!

677
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:53,888
ls he back?

678
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:58,773
He should be back soon.

679
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:03,297
The German attack cut the lines,
that's why he's late.

680
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,728
Can we go outside?

681
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,257
l wrote to my mother about you.

682
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:19,495
She wanted me to tell you,
once this war's over,

683
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:23,335
if there's anything you needed,
our family will be there for you.

684
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:27,936
You know l'm here for you.

685
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,531
They're saying Vassili is dead.

686
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:38,056
Vassili Zaitsev will never see
his loved ones again.

687
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,095
Surrender.
This is your only future.

688
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,489
You're upset?

689
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:50,699
Because Zaitsev is dead?

690
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:57,329
You don't have to hide it.
There's no shame in it.

691
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,491
You're Russian like he is.

692
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,297
Don't listen to them.

693
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:08,569
lt's just a propaganda.
He isn't dead.

694
01:38:10,740 --> 01:38:12,696
And do you know why?

695
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,772
Because l haven't killed him yet.

696
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,695
l'm going to tell you a secret.

697
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:28,249
Only you, because l know l can trust you.

698
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,213
But you must swear
you won't tell another soul.

699
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:35,895
Do you swear?

700
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,851
l found a terrific spot.

701
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:43,089
lt's by the exit from the train station.

702
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:45,696
l'll hide in the water tower.

703
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:48,335
Tomorrow l'll wait for him there.

704
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,858
You'll see. He'll be there.

705
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:56,296
He always is.

706
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,413
l also want you to swear
you'll stay home where you belong.

707
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:12,492
Do you swear?

708
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,091
We know he's alive and won't fail us,

709
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:25,172
because he is a part of us now.
Vassili is eternal.

710
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:31,530
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere for you.

711
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:34,976
Didn't you hear? l was dead.

712
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:38,894
At least...noble sniper Zaitsev...

713
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,698
...Vassili was dead.

714
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:45,572
The real one.

715
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,379
Me.

716
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:54,689
l was asleep.
And l missed my chance.

717
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:58,057
Then l was curled up in a corner hiding,

718
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:02,010
from a man who wants to kill me.

719
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:03,772
l'll talk to Kruschev.

720
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:07,249
He'll send you back to your old division.

721
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,339
Where's Tania?

722
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,058
She's at the shelter.

723
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,054
- l've been to the shelter.
- l told her you weren't dead.

724
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,492
The major said so,
that the other Germans were lying.

725
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:24,571
He told me you were waiting for him
at the station.

726
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:02,610
My little Sacha.

727
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:04,575
l knew it.

728
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:33,170
l knew you weren't dead.

729
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:37,617
- How?
- Because we've only just met.

730
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:45,939
l prayed for the first time
since l was a little girl.

731
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:51,976
When l opened my eyes, Sacha was
there waiting to give me the good news.

732
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:58,611
l think he loves you even more than l do.

733
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:23,928
To the proper military authority.

734
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,897
l'm calling to the commander's attention

735
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:30,451
recent changes noted in attitude towards
fighting of soldier, Vassili Zaitsev.

736
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:34,536
He has attempted on several occasions
to escape his duties,

737
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:38,739
voiced doubts on our chances of victory
and made defeatist comments in public.

738
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:44,458
The inexplicable duration of his duel
with the Nazi sharpshooter

739
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:50,297
can only be explained
by his lack of belief in the Communist ideal.

740
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,533
Good morning, Sacha.

741
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:04,774
Once again, he knew exactly
where to find me.

742
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:07,378
Don't you think that's strange?

743
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:11,175
Apart from me, only you knew.

744
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:15,455
l don't hold it against you, Sacha.

745
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:17,576
You've done a very brave thing.

746
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:21,169
You've chosen your camp.
l respect that.

747
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:23,331
But it isn't my camp.

748
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,491
We're both soldiers.

749
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:30,254
We're both enemies.
So l know you understand.

750
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:35,378
l'm annoyed with you for not staying
at home as l'd made you swear.

751
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:40,573
l'm annoyed with you for obliging me
to do what l'll have to do.

752
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:48,330
l've never seen anyone frown
so much in their sleep.

753
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:54,175
How long have you been watching me?

754
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:55,978
All night.

755
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:59,573
You've been snoring away happily
for hours.

756
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:01,651
l don't snore, do l?

757
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:03,933
Like a pig!

758
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,489
l suppose l talk in my sleep as well?

759
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,730
There's something l should tell you.

760
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:21,175
On the train...

761
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:24,458
...coming here...

762
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:28,253
...we were in the same car.

763
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,448
l saw you.

764
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:35,458
You were reading and you fell asleep.

765
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:41,492
l didn't dare look at you,
you were so beautiful.

766
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:45,332
You were scary.

767
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,733
Afterwards, l couldn't stop thinking
about you.

768
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:54,056
lt made me smile.

769
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:59,099
Then l thought of all the men
who would get to hold you -

770
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,253
who'd make you laugh -

771
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:07,817
how lucky they were.

772
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:14,298
And now l'm the one lying next to you.

773
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:19,374
- Was l snoring?
- Like a pig.

774
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:57,777
Oh my God!

775
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:00,859
Tania, no.

776
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:02,772
No, get off me.

777
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:05,500
- Get off me.
- lt's what he wants.

778
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,537
This is what he wants.

779
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,372
He'll kill you.

780
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:13,499
He'll kill you, then he'll kill me too.

781
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:17,778
This is what he wants. l'll get him.
l promise l'll get him.

782
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:22,372
l'll get his rifle for you, l promise Tania.

783
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:43,818
l need you.

784
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,898
You have to leave now, Mrs Filipov.
Stalingrad may fall.

785
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:52,893
The last boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.

786
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:55,699
He's brought you a pass.
You'll be safe on the other side.

787
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,533
Gather your things
and we'll help you to the landing stage.

788
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:02,010
l'm not leaving. This is my home.

789
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:05,092
This is my Sacha's home.
l can't leave.

790
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:07,296
l must tell you something, Mrs Filipov.

791
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:12,170
Something very difficult to understand.

792
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:14,569
lt's about Sacha.

793
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:33,411
He's gone over to the Germans.
He won't be coming back.

794
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:37,819
Oh my God.

795
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:43,293
Oh my God.

796
01:47:45,620 --> 01:47:47,531
He's become a traitor.

797
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:51,416
The poor little thing.

798
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:54,290
What has he done?

799
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:59,934
So he's going to stay over there?

800
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:07,651
Yes. He's going to stay over there.

801
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:12,370
l shouldn't be saying this,
comrade Commissar,

802
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:14,337
but maybe it's for the best.

803
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:17,770
lf the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

804
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:21,410
l know it's wrong,
but perhaps he's made the right choice.

805
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:09,336
l need a doctor. A doctor!

806
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:18,334
l have a pass.
You must let her cross.

807
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,015
Please.

808
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:25,694
lt's useless. She'll never make it.

809
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:28,897
No, she will. She's my daughter.

810
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:31,335
She's my daughter, l beg of you.

811
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:35,209
All right, you too.
Put this one on the boat.

812
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:25,131
Where is he? Where's the major?

813
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,370
A few inches from your face.

814
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:32,854
l've been such a fool, Vassili.

815
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:36,496
Man will always be man.

816
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:39,336
There is no new man.

817
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:43,817
We tried so hard to create a society
that was equal,

818
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:46,096
where there'd be nothing
to envy your neighbour.

819
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:50,129
But there's always something to envy.

820
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:54,811
A smile...a friendship.

821
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:59,852
Something you don't have
and want to appropriate.

822
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:03,972
ln this world, even a Soviet one,

823
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:07,375
there will always be rich and poor.

824
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:10,932
Rich in gifts.

825
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,218
Poor in gifts.

826
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:17,177
Rich in love.

827
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:19,928
Poor in love.

828
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,655
Tania isn't coming back.

829
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:32,689
She's dead, Vassili.

830
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:42,815
She was cut down by shrapnel.

831
01:51:42,980 --> 01:51:46,256
lt was quick.
l don't think she even saw it coming.

832
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,938
She was on her way back to you,

833
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:52,898
as soon as she had seen Mrs Filipov
to the boat.

834
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:57,050
She was coming back for you.
She was right.

835
01:51:57,820 --> 01:51:59,538
You're a good man, Vassili.

836
01:52:03,860 --> 01:52:05,896
l want to help you Vassili.

837
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:08,610
Let me do one last thing.

838
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:11,089
Something useful for a change.

839
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:20,018
- Let me show you where the major is.
- No, don't do that.

840
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:21,329
Don't do that!

841
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:30,175
Today, February
3rd, 1 943, is an ominous day for Hitler

842
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:34,219
and the endless columns
of thousands of German prisoners

843
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:38,089
lt is an unforgettable day of hope
for our motherland,

844
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:40,455
for the people of the Soviet Union.

845
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:56,379
After 1 80 days of growing combat
in the martyred city of Stalingrad,

846
01:56:56,540 --> 01:57:00,977
and as a result of the valour
and self sacrifice of our soldiers

847
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:04,655
the commander of our glorious Red Army

848
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:09,974
received the unconditional surrender
of the German fascist invasion.

849
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:28,700
l cannot find the matching name
in the book.

850
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:31,694
This is this hospital's address
and this is her name.

851
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:36,297
- This is our address, but she's not here.
- We don't have her anymore.

852
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:41,739
This is the address of this place and she's
obviously been here. She wrote to me.

853
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:46,894
Believe me. There is no Tania Chernova.
l can't help you.

854
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:24,655
