1
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,700
Subjects wanted!

2
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,200
Profits: 4000 mark, 
for a 14 day during experiment.

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,200
...in a spurious jail.

4
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,900
Crown Plaza, please.

5
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,200
THE EXPERIMENT

6
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,600
- Take care.
- You too.

7
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,000
Fighting dogs, fighting dogs?
Where for does someone need fighting dogs?

8
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,700
In former days the Romans used to have fighting dogs.

9
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
Sorry, don't I know you?

10
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Hold on, P&S, Cola, Spiegel and
don't take me wrong...

11
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,100
...Hubba Bubba, right or am I right?

12
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,300
Right.

13
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,300
Hey, now I know. Aren't you from 
that booth down Aachenerstrasse?

14
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,600
And you are Tarek, right or am I right?

15
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,600
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Yes, I know every cabdriver in this town.
Cabdriver?

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
I was one either some day.

18
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,100
Good day gentleman.

19
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
I am doctor Grimm, the scientific 
assistant of this experiment.

20
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,700
You all know what you are here for?
Subjects.

21
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,100
The experiment is painless.
There's no need for medication.

22
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,100
It's about group-behaviour in an 
imprisoned situation.

23
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Are we playing guards or imprisoners?

24
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,100
You are divided into groups. 
The computer will decide that.

25
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,100
We are doing a series of tests to 
examine your psychic condition.

26
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
Previously I need to make the following remark:

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Willing to participate in this experiment

28
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,100
means you will renounce 
your private life and fundamental rights.

29
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,000
Anyone having problems with that?

30
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,100
Ok, then let's start.

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
Steward? 
No, ground personnel.

32
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,100
then it's about time!

33
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
Mr. Faahd?...
Fahd.

34
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,900
come with me please.

35
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,100
It says here you drive a cab.
Yes.

36
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,900
Is that your real job or just temporary?

37
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
What you mean, temporary?

38
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,800
I mean, aren't you having any other jobs 
besides driving a cab?

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No.

40
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm just asking, because it says here also that
you have studied philosophy, architecture and sociology.

41
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,900
Yes, that is correct, it's true... 

42
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,700
temporarily.

43
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Good Mr. Fahd, your moral values are almost all
within the norms and you have a good condition.

44
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
That is important,
you can during the experiment

45
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,200
being exposed to very extreme situations.

46
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Extreme situations?

47
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
But you will watch over me, don't you?

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Uhm, the experiment will be guarded 24 hours 
a day by video.

49
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
So nothing will happen to me.

50
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,700
Oh no!
- Yes!

51
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
He lives!

52
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,700
You've owed me 500 for two years.

53
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,500
I know, you'll get it.

54
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,900
Sounds interesting.
They say the army is behind it.

55
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,600
With plenty of money.

56
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,300
What do you want?

57
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,300
Start again? Say "sorry"?
Kind of late after two years!

58
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,100
l had stress.

59
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,200
You drive a taxi.

60
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,700
Yes.

61
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,100
And you want to be
locked up for two weeks!

62
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,000
But it's a good story.

63
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,700
Ten thousand. including photos.
No expenses.

64
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,300
Thanks.

65
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,900
Yes?
-Hi, Fahd. l called.

66
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,100
l told you, don't jump on the sofa!

67
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,300
1 lux, 250 by 268 pixels.

68
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,300
Press right: freeze frame.
Press left: continuous motion.

69
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,100
Receiver and recorder disguised
as a Walkman. The transmitter...

70
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,900
...has a range of 100 meters.

71
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,100
Cool.

72
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
Ready for tomorrow?
- Sure.

73
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,300
This is a reference test.
We'll do it again after the experiment.

74
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,400
Don't worry. It's not unpleasant.

75
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Don't you feel well?

76
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,900
It's okay.

77
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Do you have a problem
with enclosed spaces?

78
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,100
Everything okay, no problem.

79
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,300
Shit.

80
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,400
Shit, shit, shit!

81
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,700
Are you injured?

82
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,700
You had red!
You could've been dead!

83
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,000
This is my father's car.

84
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
He'll be happy you're alive.

85
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm coming from his funeral.

86
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,500
What?

87
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,200
Where were you going?
- To Zandvoort.

88
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,000
Maybe you shouldn't go there.

89
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,900
What?

90
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,500
I don't believe in coincidences.
Nothing just happens in life.

91
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,400
Even the worst things somehow
make sense.

92
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,100
l, for example,
should no longer drive a taxi.

93
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,300
This will hurt a little.

94
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,600
Funny, it seems to be deep,
but there's no blood.

95
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,700
If you're right, why is he dead?

96
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,400
What sense does that make?

97
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't know.

98
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,200
Worst thing is, l couldn't
talk to him anymore.

99
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,200
Didn't see him for four years,
couldn't talk to him anymore.

100
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,100
Maybe that wasn't necessary.

101
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,300
He was 65. He had a good life.

102
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
'Dora, be glad, he had a nice death.'

103
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,900
But I'm not glad.

104
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm not here any more.

105
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,400
Sometimes life doesn't go on.
That's okay.

106
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
Can l lie down somewhere?

107
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
Are you going to stay here?

108
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,300
Yes, I'll be next door.
- No, l mean here.

109
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,400
Please meet Professor Thon,
the director of this experiment.

110
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,200
Gentlemen, l would like to thank
all of you for participating.

111
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,600
You are brave men.

112
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900
You laugh, but I'm serious.

113
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,000
The next two weeks will be
a new experience for you.

114
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,500
You'll undergo and exert pressure.

115
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,600
Some of you will have
no civil rights for two weeks.

116
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,200
Do not underestimate that.

117
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,500
If anyone wants to go now,
it's your last chance.

118
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,400
Your safety is number one priority.

119
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,700
Violence must not be used!
Whoever gets violent...

120
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
...is out of the experiment.
Is that clear?

121
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,100
Fine. Would the following
gentlemen please stand up:

122
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,000
Are we prisoners or guards?

123
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,600
Please, gentlemen.

124
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,200
Guards! Cool!

125
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,800
Please put on your uniforms.

126
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,900
But we get 4000 too?

127
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,900
Four? I get 8000!

128
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,800
No, we have to pay.

129
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,000
Hands on your back, legs spread!

130
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Gentlemen.

131
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,400
You are now guards
at a penitentiary.

132
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,800
Your job is to maintain
peace and order,

133
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,000
to make sure the rules are obeyed.

134
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,400
Take it seriously! The experiment
succeeds or fails with you!

135
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
If you don't do your job right...

136
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,100
...the experiment makes no sense
and we can stop it right now.

137
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,300
You don't play guards,
you are guards!

138
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,100
Your first task: to explain
the situation to the prisoners.

139
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Please turn around!

140
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,000
Thanks.

141
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Next one, please!

142
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,900
Go over there!

143
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,400
Put on the dress!

144
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,800
What about underwear?
- No underwear!

145
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,500
Can l have number 69?
- Quiet!

146
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
I hope it's a mixed sauna!

147
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,500
They're crazy, women's coats!
Maybe we have to piss sitting down!

148
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,500
Quiet, 69!

149
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,100
Let's go!

150
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,300
Everyone out, please!

151
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,800
Really cool!

152
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,700
The 1st day

153
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,600
Keep going! Everyone in line!

154
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,000
Is there Pay-TV?

155
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,400
They're nuts, look at this!

156
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,600
Keep going, please. Quickly!

157
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,400
Did you imagine this?
- No. Quite a professional slammer!

158
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,000
Now we're in deep shit.

159
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,600
Stand in a row on the marker line!

160
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,200
What happens now?

161
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:59,200
Prison rules. One: The prisoners
address each other by numbers only.
 
162
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:05,000
Two: The prisoners address
the guards as "Mr Prison Guard".

163
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,600
Three: At "lights out",
the prisoners must not talk.

164
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,800
Then we'll sing!
- Quiet!

165
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,300
Four: Meals are to be
eaten up completely.

166
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,300
Read the menu to us!

167
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Quiet!

168
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,300
Five: Each order of the guards
is to be obeyed immediately.

169
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,200
Six: Failure to obey the rules
will result in punishment.

170
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,000
What kind of punishment?

171
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,000
We'll see to that. We're flexible.
And now cell assignments.

172
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,800
When l call out your number
go to the cells!

173
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,700
21, 74, 86 - cell 1 .

174
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,900
82, 15, 94 - cell 2.

175
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,200
77, 69, 38 - cell 3.

176
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,600
53, 40, 11 - cell 4.

177
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,600
I'll tell you, l snore.
- Great.

178
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,200
You get the bottom bunk.
- Alright.

179
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm Joe.
- Tarek.

180
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
And you?
- Thirty-eight.

181
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Why do you want to take
part in this experiment?

182
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,800
Because l think it
can be very interesting.

183
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,200
4000 marks is a lot of money.

184
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,200
You can really relax and
experience something new.

185
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,300
You have to be open to ideas
and I need the money.

186
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
It might be lots of fun.

187
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,100
Because of the bucks.

188
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,000
General interest.

189
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,400
l was never in prison.

190
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
Me? No!

191
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,200
No.

192
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,200
No, really.

193
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,200
Jeez! I'm a regular guy!

194
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,400
I have a kiosk, corner of
Brussels and Aachen Street.

195
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,700
Executive.

196
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,100
I have a few people
working under me.

197
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm a school teacher.

198
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,500
I perform as Elvis.

199
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,400
l work for an airline.

200
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,300
Here's my card.

201
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,500
In seven years I was never late.

202
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,700
Where's the next cigarette machine?

203
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,200
Downstairs and to the right!

204
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,700
Hey, Elvis.

205
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,300
Sing something!

206
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,200
Yes, sing a song!

207
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,900
When do we get to eat?

208
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,100
We're hungry!

209
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,400
Do you have something
against anal burning?

210
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,900
What do you do in real life?
- I'm an electrician. High voltage.

211
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,300
Them with the big cables. You?
- Taxi driver.

212
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,000
And you, 38?
- You ask too much, 77. 

213
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,300
I guess something with numbers.

214
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,300
Bus driver.

215
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,900
Numbers and staring straight
ahead silently, right?

216
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,600
Life guard!

217
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
Really?

218
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,300
You know this one?

219
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,500
Which animal has only
one lip on the vulva?

220
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,500
Half a roasted chicken.

221
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,900
What do the Arabs call
a cow barn? Moobarrac!

222
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,400
Why do women always watch
porn films to the end?

223
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,100
They think they'll get married.

224
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,700
I know one that's a bit longer.
Three guys in front of a sauna.

225
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,500
One of them goes in and there is
a giant, fat woman with a huge...

226
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,400
Three against three!

227
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,300
Come on, you coward!

228
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,100
The cheese is so dry
you could smoke it.

229
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,600
I've got a kiosk, there's
always something going on.

230
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,100
I've got an open ear for everyone.

231
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,700
Listening you can't learn.
You're born with it.

232
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,300
Drink your milk, 82.
- I don't drink milk.

233
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,500
I get postcards from Jamaica,
Sri Lanka...

234
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,300
Rule number four, 82.
Consume all your food!

235
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,500
I never drink milk. I hate milk.

236
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,000
Go on, a rule is a rule!

237
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,000
Milk makes me sick.
- Drink. Your. Milk.

238
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,600
One to zero for us, Schutte!

239
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,000
Eat up! You have two minutes.

240
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,900
Back to your cells!

241
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,800
Idiot!

242
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,100
Is there a problem?

243
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,000
Away from the doors!

244
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Now: Shut up! Bedtime!

245
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,900
Anyone hurt?

246
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Quiet! Whoever talks now...

247
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,300
...does push-ups.

248
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Good night, ladies!

249
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,900
Can you live from that?
- Sure.

250
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,300
You can't let them push you around!

251
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,700
What should I do?

252
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,100
They have to take us seriously
or we can forget it.

253
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,200
If you say he has to drink
his milk, then he has to.

254
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,100
Yeah, sure.

255
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,700
But the Elvis number is good!
- Cool hip swing!

256
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,800
My wife made that.
- No, thanks. Do you have kids?

257
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,700
A son, four months.

258
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,100
Sweet! These are my rug rats.

259
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
Twins? Cute, too.

260
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,900
Can I see them as well?
- Sure.

261
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,900
What about you, Berus?
- A daughter.

262
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,500
How old?
- She'll be twelve in three days.

263
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,900
Do you have a photo?

264
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,600
No photo?
What kind of a father are you?

265
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm a good father!

266
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,100
Eckert? Do you have kids?

267
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,100
What's up now?

268
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,300
Out you come, 77.

269
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,800
Why?
- I said, out!

270
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,100
Push-ups!

271
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,400
Can't you say that friendlier?
- Push-ups!

272
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,900
I heard you the first time, homo.

273
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,300
Very easy - just say please once.

274
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,200
What?
 
275
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,100
Fine, the whole cell, out!
38, 69, out!

276
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,400
Wait a sec, did you sleep
on your Superman comics?

277
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,900
They're not involved. Talk to me!

278
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,700
And down! Twenty!

279
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,600
I didn't do anything!

280
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,300
Remember who
you have to thank for this.

281
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:14,800
Jerk!

282
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,700
And another twenty for that!

283
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,500
I had no idea
you could be so hard!

284
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,300
Great show!

285
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,800
Did you see that?
They're doing everything.

286
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,500
Get up! Out of the cells!
Line up!

287
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,500
The 2nd day

288
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Get moving!

289
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,500
The ladies in cell three,
sore muscles?
 
290
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,800
Morning.

291
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,400
If I installed a taxi radio
the drivers could order some meat...

292
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,400
...and I have it deep fried on time.

293
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,300
Gentlemen, finish breakfast!

294
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,500
82,

295
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400
you didn't drink your milk.

296
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,200
I said that I don't drink milk.

297
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Well, milk or push-ups.

298
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,700
But I miss some enzyme!

299
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Wonderful, let's do push-ups
instead of milk.

300
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,200
All together, right? Let's do
push-ups for Schutte.

301
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,900
Sure we'll do push-ups!

302
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Excuse me, Mr. Prison Guard!

303
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,000
One, two, three...

304
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,000
...four, five, six...

305
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,400
...seven, eight, nine...

306
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,900
That's clever.

307
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,600
What if he really is allergic to milk?
- Nonsense. The problem is 77.

308
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,600
Come on, bed check!

309
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,600
He really stinks!

310
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,300
You learn that as a lifeguard?
- The very first thing.

311
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,000
77, made your bed yet?

312
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,800
That's mean.

313
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,100
You'll have to do it again!

314
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,600
Do it again, I said!

315
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,000
I'll count to three
and the bed is made.

316
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,800
And one!

317
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,800
And two!

318
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,700
And three!

319
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,800
Shall I call the guards?

320
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,400
Jutta, quickly!

321
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,300
Come on, I'll help you.

322
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,800
We don't want to get out
of here anyway, do we?

323
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,100
We want gummy bears!
And cable TV.

324
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,800
That's a walkie-talkie, no phone!

325
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,000
What about pizza?
- Yeah, pizza.

326
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,400
And porn magazines!

327
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,000
What about basketball?

328
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,300
Admit it! You lost!
It's just a game!

329
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,000
Here we go now, here we go now!

330
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,400
Piss off, cocksucker!

331
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,000
Barricades, barricades!

332
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,600
What's going on there?
- We didn't do anything!

333
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,800
In two hours they're exhausted.

334
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,600
We have to react or
they do what they want!

335 
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,900
77, the asshole.

336
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,300
Professor, what should we do now?

337
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Bosch, that won't do any good!

338
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,900
We can't use violence.
 
339
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,700
We stick together.
They're twelve, we're eight.

340
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
Suggestions?

341
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,000
Berus, what about you?
Don't you ever say anything?

342
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,500
I once read...

343
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,400
What? I can't understand you.

344
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,000
I once read that you get
control in such a situation...

345
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,500
...with humiliation.

346
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,600
We don't want to hurt anyone,
they just have to respect us.

347
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
After 36 hours - it's incredible!

348
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,300
Undress!

349
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,100 
Get up! Strip off your coats!

350
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,000
We give up!

351
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Hey, they gave up!

352
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,200
Seventy-seven!

353
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,500
Keep calm, it's all a game, okay?
- Go, Berus!

354
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,400
Undress!

355
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,300
Your hand!

356
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,800
And down!

357
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,300
Wasn't that a bit too hard?

358
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,200
No, as long as they don't say
anything up there, we're doing fine.

359
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,000
They do want
some action down here!

360
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,700
Bosch, it wasn't violence.

361
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,900
Fire extinguishers, Berus, cool.

362
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,900
Gentlemen, you've restored peace
and order, solved your problem.

363
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,400
Keep going! But please remember
to act appropriate.

364
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,600
Perhaps the next conflict can be
solved differently. Thank you.

365
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,100
This is Tarek Fahd,
messages after the beep.

366
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,100
What happens next?

367
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,300
Nothing happens. Stay calm,
that's the best strategy.

368
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,500
You can get the bed.

369
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,300
Get out!

370
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,300
The 3rd day

371
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
Good morning, gentlemen!

372
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,500
l think no-one wants
to repeat last night.

373
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,700
We still have eleven days to go.
Suggestion:

374
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,700
We stay reasonable...

375
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,300
...then we all get our money
and that's it.

376
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,300
Okay?
Or does anyone like stress?

377
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,000
Good. Is that okay, 77?

378
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,200
Yeah.

379
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,700
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

380
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,500
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.
- Fine.

381
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,000
See! It wasn't that bad.

382
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,400
82, if you have to puke,
then go to the loo.

383
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,900
That's the rule.
He has to drink. We can't help it.

384
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,100
We thought we'd restore
order, make them obey us.

385
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,600
So it runs smoother for us.

386
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:23,200
That we have them in our hands,
that we're at the helm again.

387
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,100
After all, it wasn't violence.

388
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,700
We'll see what happens.

389
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,700
Hi, Schutte
- No names!

390
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,700
Tell me, why are you doing this?

391
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,900
I do it often. Guinea pig.

392
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,100
Once I got an intestinal probe.
It was worse than this here.

393
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,600
The people were nicer,
but I got only 900 marks for it.

394
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,800
What do you do with the money?

395
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,700
I've got sort of a dream.
- Yeah, what?

396
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,300
No, you'll laugh at me.
- I won't laugh at you. I promise.

397
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,700
A Ferrari.
- Do you know what a Ferrari costs?

398
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,900
Not a new one.
l know a dealer, he likes me.

399
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,300
Maybe a '89
if the bank plays along.

400
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,000
Fine. But to fill her up
you'll need another loan.

401
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,700
A yellow one.

402
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,700
I'd park it at my kiosk
so that everyone can see it.

403
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,200
I dreamed of it all my life.

404
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,000
It's important to have a dream.

405
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,100
I read that somewhere.
It's true. What's your dream?

406
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,500
Does anyone have drugs here?
I think this is a jail!

407
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,700
Keep your trap shut today, 77!
- What do you want?

408
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,100
Kiss my ass!

409
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,500
Mr Prison Guard Berus,
I've got a question.

410
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,000
That number yesterday,
could it be that it turned you on a bit?

411
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,600
I think I saw it clearly.
Did you fuck your wife hard at home?

412
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,100
Shut up, you idiot!
- Or don't you have a wife?

413
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,000
Could be.

414
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,000
Ground staff, right? You're all gay!

415
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,200
And Mr Prison Guard,
there's something else.

416
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,500
You smell a bit strong.

417
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,200
Yes! Has anyone ever told you
that you stink, man!

418
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,400
There's something,
people call it soap.

419
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,100
If you'd use it you wouldn't
stink any more. Although -

420
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,500
I reckon for some people
even that doesn't work.

421
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,200
Shut up!
- Yeah, hit me, girlie!

422
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,900
Hit me and you're out of here!

423
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:22,200
No, you won't hit me.
You're really hot for this job here!

424
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,600
Tarek, stop it!

425
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,200
Don't spoil it! There's so much
more you could do with us!

426
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,200
What's going on here?

427
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,600
Nothing. 77 is going back to his cell.

428
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,000
Not bad.

429
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,000
Give me that thing!

430
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,200
What are they paying for the story?

431
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,500
Phase 3: Prisoner attacks prisoner.
You're pushing it on purpose!

432
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,000
Kiss my ass!

433
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,700
They pay more if it really gets wild!
 

434
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,300
And what are you doing here,
soldier?! Name, rank, outfit!

435
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,300
Come on, you can't fool me!

436
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,000
Steinhoff, Air Force, Major.

437
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,200
Pilot?
- Yes. Who are you working for?

438
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,000
'Reporter'. What else
is going to happen?

439
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,500
They're going to provoke
a series of stress situations.

440
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,400
What is your job?
- Observe and report.

441
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,900
And not let myself be manipulated.

442
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,600
So that's it.

443
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,800
Yes, that's the way it is.

444
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,700
86,

445
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,200
...21, 74, 94, 15, 82...

446
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,200
...38, 77, 69, 53, 40, 11.

447
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,800
Whoever talks now sleeps in the
yard without a blanket. Clear?

448
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,700
Dismissed.

449
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,200
Surprise!

450
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,600
We can't do that!

451
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,800
What do we have here?

452
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,500
Guys! It's just to warm up!

453
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,700
Sorry, l wanted to ask if
I could go a bit earlier today.

454
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,800
l thought we'll deal with 77!
- Yeah, I know.

455
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,400
What "I know"? No, Bosch!
"When?"... then everyone.

456
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,800
Yes.

457
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,000
I brought something else!

458
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,200
Are you crazy?
- It's only a gas gun with blanks.

459
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,400
Dennis, it's me.
I'm not selling the house.

460
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,900
I have to go back to Cologne.
I'll call you.

461
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,200
You got along well, didn't you?

462
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,600
He was the cleverest person
I've known. Showed me everything.

463
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,100
Ain't easy having such a father.

464
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,100
My father...

465
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,200
 
...is an asshole.

466
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,600
The greatest asshole in the world.

467
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,700
We had this little game.

468
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,200
He said don't do that and I did it.

469
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,500
What?

470
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,400
Everything. Always.

471
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,500
He's a photographer.

472
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,900
When I was eight he locked me
in his darkroom. For a whole day.

473
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
l was really afraid in there.

474
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,900
I cried, whined, begged for hours.

475
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,400
My mother didn't dare to let me out.

476
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,600
At some point...

477
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,200
...I didn't have the strength
to scream any more.

478
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,000
Then everything got really quiet.

479
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,100
I thought I was going to die.

480
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,500
But I only pissed my pants.

481
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,900
Fasten your seat belt, sweetie!

482
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,100
You stupid little asshole!
You think you're smart!

483
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,300
No cameras!

484
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,500
We're all alone here.
- We just want to talk to you.

485
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,100
You're not saying anything!

486
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,300
Make sure to leave no marks!

487
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,400
How sweet he can look!

488
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,700
I'm not sure if
I should hit him or fuck him!

489
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,900
Enough!

490
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,500
Sit still or it's gonna hurt!

491
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,700
Give it to me!

492
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,500
Do it properly! Got to look right.

493
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,000
If it's gonna be cold,
we'll knit you a cap.

494
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,200
You will no longer
endanger the experiment.

495
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,900
We'll say you applied for release,
then you're out by tomorrow.

496
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,300
We don't want you any more.
- Did you get that, 77?

497
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,400
Hey, dickhead!
- Let me hear you understood, 77!

498
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,900
I understand.
- Say it right!

499
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,000
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

500
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,600
I've got to piss.
- Did it hurt?

501
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,300
I think I have to piss, too.

502
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,900
Well, who stinks now?

503
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,800
You can sing him a lullaby, Bosch.

504
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,200
You asked the guards?
- Yes.

505
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:13,900
The 4th day

506
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,600
Why?
- It itched.

507
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,300
How do you feel?

508
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,300
Fine, thank you.

509
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,400
You made an application?
- What kind of application?

510
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,700
The guards told us that you
would like to leave, Mr. Fahd.

511
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,300
That's complete nonsense.

512
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,500
Listen! 77 has decided to
stay with us to our great joy.

513
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,100
Now: if 77 gets out of line
everyone has to pay for it!

514
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,200
I don't hear anything.

515
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,100
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

516
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,400
You're so stupid.

517
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,500
I'm getting out of here,
but not this way.

518
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,300
What's your plan?

519
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,700
Head down, 94!
Chin to your chest!

520
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,300
No lies, no dirty words!
We'll read each letter.

521
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,600
Why aren't you writing?

522
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,500
Who to?
- Your pals from the kiosk.

523
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,400
I just made all that up.

524
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,700
I don't have any pals. I might know
what they smoke, but...

525
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,600
Don't talk, write!

526
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,800
...I don't really know them.

527
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,600
Write: Bilker Strasse 278,

528
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,100
50300 Cologne.

529
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,900
Are you gonna be quiet there?

530
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,900
Write to me!

531
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,800
From there on there are no cameras.
- And you didn't see any of that?

532
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,300
I was changing the tapes.

533
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,200
Someone always has to watch!

534
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,900
I don't like it. A serious
assault on the fourth day!

535
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,500
It's the power struggle between
Berus and 77, as expected.

536
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,900
The lock in the basement door
has to be changed!

537
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,700
Put the letters into the envelopes.

538
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,500
And don't seal them.

539
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,400
Just a moment! 77, step out!

540
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,900
You're not interested in
writing letters?

541
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,500
So it was your last one!
Back in line!

542
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,900
Turn left!

543
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,800
Now the song!

544
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,900
Whoever doesn't know the words
by tomorrow really has it coming!

545
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,200
Dismissed.

546
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,500
Thanks.

547
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,500
You want to bust it? Maybe the
others just want their money!

548
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,200
You think what's happening
here is okay?

549
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,200
That's not the point.

550
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,300
I can't manage it by myself.
You're the only one I can ask.

551
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,500
Are you going to help me, pilot?

552
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,600
Are you going to help me, Steinhoff?
- No.

553
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,500
Go fuck yourself.
- You too.

554
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,300
You're a soldier! Embarrassing,
if you broke it off!

555
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,900
I reject any escalation.
- But you forgot one thing:

556
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,800
It's not a war, it's a simulation!
- Is it?

557
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,300
You always do what they tell you!

558
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,500
You really think Berus
wanted to get rid of you?

559
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,700
He wanted to see if you'd come back.
You did what they expected you to do.

560
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,300
You're endangering the whole
group. So l won't help you.

561
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,200
Let me out!

562
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,300
What's wrong with you? Stay calm!

563
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,900
From now on 69 is called Sissy.

564
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,300
Calm down!

565
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,600
13,...

566
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,400
14, 15...

567
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,400
It's only an experiment, a joke!
You apply, tomorrow you're out!

568
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,600
You want to leave us?

569
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,600
Yes, it's too much for me.

570
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,700
You know you won't get paid?
- Yes.

571
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,200
But you said you did it
because of the money?

572
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,600
That's right.

573
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,400
And now you don't care
about the money any more?

574
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,100
I want to go!

575
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,500
Mr. Maier, how do you feel now?

576
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,300
I want out!

577
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,100
l couldn't live without cigarettes.

578
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,400
What if we decided
not to release you?

579
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,900
But l can go any time!
You said it's voluntary!

580
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,800
Or isn't it?

581
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,600
Tomorrow we'll let you know
our decision.

582
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,500
Tomorrow?

583
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:18,600
I'm not going back in there.
I want to go now!

584
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,000
Klaus? This man worries me.

585 
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,400
No, he's only faking.

586
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,600
The man has had it!

587
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,000
SISSY

588
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,100
Sixty-nine!

589
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,100
Leave me alone, damn it!

590
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,900
What the hell am I doing here?

591
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,500
What's the matter there?
- Number 53 doesn't feel well!

592
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,400
Guards!
- Guards!

593
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,700
I want out!

594
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,400
The man has a serious concussion.
Berus hit him in cold blood.

595
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,100
He acted his role. But I don't
approve of the accident.

596
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,700
If we don't take Berus out,
we are forcing the escalation.

597
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,200
Intervention, yes.
That was our approach.

598
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,700
This is going too far!

599
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,800
We need 77, we need Berus.
These are dynamic factors.

600
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,800
If we take Berus out, it means
aborting. Do you want that?

601
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,900
If I see you hit a prisoner again,
you're out.

602
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,100
That was necessary to restore
peace and order in the prison.

603
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:21,200
Don't tell me how to do my job.
If there are problems...

604
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,800
...I want to hear it from
Professor Thon personally.

605
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,700
Good day, Doctor.

606
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,200
What? l can't understand you!

607
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,400
You have to speak louder, Dora.
I can't hear you.

608
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,000
Hold your breath!

609
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,900
This is a panic attack.
If you hyperventilate you'll pass out.

610
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,600
Breathe shallowly, calm down.

611
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,000
Never had anything like that before.
- Sit down. Real slow.

612
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:03,700
Everything all right?

613
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:09,100
It's fine. It's a joke.
Everything's just a game.

614
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,000
That's your mistake!
You're lost with that attitude.

615
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,200
It's never a game, get that!

616
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,700
What do they know about you?

617
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,200
No idea.

618
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,700
What are you looking at?

619
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,100
Do I look like shit?

620
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,300
I got Dumbo ears, right?

621
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,100
You asshole!

622
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,900
What are you going to do
when you're out?

623
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,500
Fly away!

624
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,500
Are you going to help me now?

625
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,400
I can't!

626
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,300
Okay 69, time's up,
back to your cell!

627
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,200
Move it!

628
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,200
I'm scared shitless.

629
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,800
I keep my mouth shut.

630
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,500
I don't wanna...
 

631
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,600
get beaten up in there.

632
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:09,000
Did you see that on video?

633
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,300
He hit him full tilt!

634
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,400
Is the man well?

635
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,600
I'll still go in there,
see that nothing happens.

636
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:23,000
But I don't wanna talk
about obvious feelings.

637
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,900
It was right
he got one, the jerk!

638
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,100
We could get insulted
or injured any time.

639
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,100
If they do what we say,
no problems, good feeling.

640
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,900
We gotta be more careful...

641
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,600
...opposite the prisoners.

642
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,100
Nobody comes near me any more!

643
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,500
The 5th day

644
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,500
What is it?

645
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,100
Oh, God. Shit, how do you look?

646
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,400
Guards, we need help!
- Not the guards!

647
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,600
No, please don't, not the guards!

648
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,000
We need someone who can help us!

649
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,900
No! They want to kill me! No!

650
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,200
You just have to go to a doctor.

651
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,300
No! Help me! I don't want to!

652
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,000
86, 23, 74, 94, 15...

653
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,400
...82, 38, 77, 40, 11 .

654
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,500
We have two losses today:

655
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,300
69...

656
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,500
and 53.
In exchange we have a new cell.

657
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,900
All light- and sound-proof,
but you can get air inside.

658
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,200
I hope no-one has a problem
with enclosed spaces?

659
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,200
No, Mr Prison Guard.

660 
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:15,300
Fine. Today is visiting day.
You may put on your good coats.

661
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,100
Don't get them dirty. Understood?

662
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,000
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

663
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,400
Do you get a visitor too, 82?

664
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,300
No, Mr Prison Guard.

665
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:33,500
Why not? Don't you have
a wife, kids, relatives?

666
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,100
No, Mr Prison Guard.

667
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,100
And no friends! No visitor!

668
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,100
"Dear Tarek, you are the only one
I can write a letter to...

669
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,300
...because you're my only friend."

670
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,200
"I hope
I can do something for you someday."

671
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,200
"You can always count
on me. Your Gunter."

672
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,600
Are you a faggot, 82?

673
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,100
Yes, 77?

674
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,500
Was that attempted assault
on a prison guard?

675
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,500
Definitely.

676
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,400
Because 77 still hasn't got the rules...

677
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,800
 
...he'll clean the toilet with his dress.

678
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
No visitors until everything
is impeccable!

679
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,200
I didn't know about that.

680
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,300
We agreed not to use the black box!

681
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,700
It's for psychological pressure only.

682
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,600
53 and 69 are in hospital.

683
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,400
82 is depressive.

684
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,800
We have extreme helplessness,
loss of sense for reality...

685
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,600
And disorientation, yes!
That's our field of research.

686
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,200
In five days we had submission to
authority, subliminal violence...

687
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,700
...and complete de-individualization.

688
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,500
Exactly! We achieved our goal.
Stop and present the results!

689
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,600
No! We have a stable moment.

690
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,600
So far nothing is happening
which we didn't expect.

691
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,400
There's no comparable data
anywhere in the world.

692
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,200
We have nine more days.

693
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,900
If we stop now, we're giving away
the chance of a lifetime.

694
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,100
Perhaps it's a mistake.

695
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,200
I didn't realize what we were in for.

696
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,400
I have the feeling we're losing control.

697
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,400
Jutta, what can happen?
We can intervene any time.

698
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,000
I can no longer be responsible.
- What is that supposed to mean?

699
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,300
I'll meet the committee in three hours.
I need a clear decision from you.

700
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,400
Do you still stand behind
the project? Yes or no?

701
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,700
Our nude cleaning lady!

702
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,600
There's still something
sticking to the edge.

703
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,900
It will not work like this, 77.

704
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:27,500
Very nice!

705
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,500
Enough!

706 
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:45,900
What about the coat?
- It's your coat, 77. Put it on!

707
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,400
On the line!

708
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,600
Very nice.

709
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:58,100
Let's make a good impression.
No lies and no complaints to visitors!

710
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,300
We all feel very comfortable,
don't we?

711
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:06,500
We all want to earn our money
in peace and quiet. Right?

712
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,300
Is that you, 77?

713
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,600
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

714
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,600
Whoever stinks gets no visitor.

715
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,200
All prisoners to the visiting room,
77 back to the cell!

716
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,500
I wanted to help you...

717
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,700
Then help me now!
- What?

718
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,900
My visitor, you have to
give him something from me.

719
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,100
That's impossible!
- It's possible!

720
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,200
Go to the caf
and give this to him!

721
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,400
What is it?
- Doesn't matter.

722
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,800
I can't do it when the other
guards are watching.

723
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,000
Yes, you can, Bosch. Please!

724
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,600
You don't look good!

725
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,300
How did you find me?
- I saw the contract...

726
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:32,200
...and talked Ziegler
into letting me take his place.

727
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,100
I live at your place.

728
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,100
How much longer will this last?
- Nine days.

729
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,600
I have to go back to Canada.

730
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,300
You can leave here any time, right?

731
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,300
Yes.

732
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,200
So, let's go!

733
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,800
There's a caf above us. A guard
will give you something from me.

734
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,700
Visiting time is over!

735
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,300
Take it to Ziegler.

736
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,600
Wait for me!

737
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,400
 
Don't worry so much.

738
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,700
It'll be alright. It's just a game.
Tomorrow we're out.

739
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:09,400
I've got everything organized.
And we're gonna get the money!

740
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:15,500
Then we'll all drive over
to your kiosk...

741
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,000
...and drink a nice cold beer.

742
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,700
All of us.
No stress or anything.

743
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,200
I promise!

744
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,600
You're off already?

745
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,900
No. Have to make a call, private.

746
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,800
Nervous, Bosch? Got something?
- Me? No!

747
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,200
Yes, you've got something!

748
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,200
Are you the friend of Mr. Fahd?
- Yes.

749
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:23,300
You have something for me?
- No. Tarek, he changed his mind.

750
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,300
I guess you know
what he's talking about.

751
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,300
He didn't say anything else?
- No.

752
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,600
Yeah...

753
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,700
Then...

754
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,900
Thanks.
- Don't worry.

755
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,300
I'll make sure nothing happens
to him. Bye.

756
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,900
Is that necessary, Mr. Eckert?
- It is.

757
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,700
I'm a cuddly bear. You'll find out.
We got enough time!

758
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,800
I wouldn't be sure about that.
If it goes on like this...

759
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,700
...I can stop the experiment any time.

760
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,300
I thought only the professor
could do so.

761
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,700
He won't be back until
tomorrow. I'm responsible now.

762
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,500
What's up?

763
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,100
The late shift should have
taken us out for the count.

764
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,000
Your sense of time smells!

765
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,900
Something else smells here!

766
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,000
I'll summarize.

767
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,700
77 is trying to bust the experiment
with Bosch and the girl.

768
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,200
Dr Grimm threatens
to stop the whole thing.

769
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,500
And Professor Thon went away.
- What are you trying to say?

770
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,900
I think this is a test. How we react to
outside disturbances.

771
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,100
Nonsense!

772
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,500
77 has made trouble
from the very beginning.

773
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,300
He might even be
a calculated disturbing factor.

774
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,500
The asshole gets more than 4000?

775
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,000
What should we do now?

776
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,700
We seal ourselves off until
Professor Thon returns.

777
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,400
Cool!

778
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,100
We do our jobs, stick to the rules!

779
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:58,100
The rules say to react to
all events appropriately.

780
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,300
Shut your mouth!

781
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,400
Professor, Lars here. The guards
have beaten up Bosch.

782
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:56,000
And I can't reach Jutta. l don't
know what to do, it's urgent!

783
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:00,900
No connection.

784
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,500
We're going to take a little trip.

785
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,700
77 to the line!

786
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:36,700
77 and a guard attempted
to attack the penitentiary.

787
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,000
Thanks to the alertness
of the guards...

788
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:41,400
...this threat to the internal
security could be prevented.

789
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,900
The guard has been suspended
from duty. He's one of you now.

790
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,800
Into the cell!

791
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,500
Dora was worried about you, 77.

792
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,900
We had a long talk.

793
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,100
I took her home. Nice place.

794
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:10,900
She smells so good. I'll take
care of her personally later on.

795
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,800
Professor Thon, this is against
the law and violates human rights!

796
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I demand to abort this experiment!

797
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,700
77 into the black box!

798
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,000
This is torture!
Stop the experiment!

799
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,700
77 will stay in the black box
until his behavior is corrected.

800
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,500
You stinking pig! You coward!

801
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:39,700
You dirty, rotten, shitty
fucking Nazi pig!

802
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,500
Come out!

803
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,500
Are you finished?

804
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,900
Good.

805
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,200
Into the black box!

806
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,800
Look at me!

807
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,800
Good evening, Doctor.

808
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,600
Please call Professor Thon.

809
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,600
What's going on here?

810
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,100
Call him!

811
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,400
Professor Thon is unavailable.
- Nonsense!

812
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,900
What?
- This is just a test.

813
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:39,500
You don't fool me!
This is just a test.

814
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,100
No, Mr. Berus!
The experiment is over now.

815
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,800
It has just been terminated.

816
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,900
Bring her downstairs.
- Come along, Doctor.

817
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:55,500
What do you think you're doing?

818
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,700
Come!
- Don't touch me!

819
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,600
Everything!

820
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,800
No! Give me the coat.

821
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:15,700
Undress!

822
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,100
Everything, please.

823
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,300
Well, Jutta, you shave your pussy!

824
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,600
Eckert, stop that! Go downstairs!

825
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,900
Put this on.

826
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:58,900
It went well.

827
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,500
Sometimes one just has to
remind people of simple things.

828
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,700
Lars here. The guards
have beaten up Bosch.

829
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:08,300
And I can't reach Jutta. I don't
know what to do, it's urgent!

830
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,500
Quickly, my car!

831
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,100
This mess you'll have to clean up
yourself later, 82.

832
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:39,700
Out, the cell belongs to the lady!

833
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,100
Listen! Whoever touches the tape...

834
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:56,600
...will be sitting next to 82.

835
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,000
This applies especially
to the new prisoners!

836
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:02,700
How long this state of emergency
lasts depends also on you!

837
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:09,900
Don't tell me about some stupid
test! They said no violence!

838
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,800
Stay calm!

839
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,800
Shit!

840
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,100
This is an emergency. We'll wait
until Professor Thon is back.

841
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,800
They want to see
if we can keep it up.

842
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:21,500
I just can't!

843
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:27,900
If you want to go, go! No need
to be afraid. Think about it!

844
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,900
I have to speak to Mr. Fahd!
- It's against the rules.

845
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,400
I insist or I'll call the police.

846
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,300
Come on!
You'll see everything is okay.

847
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,300
I'll try to arrange a meeting
with Tarek.

848
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,400
But you must promise
not to tell anyone.

849
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,900
Take care of Schutte!

850
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,300
Schutte! It'll be alright.

851
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,900
Stop it!

852
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:08,900
Unlock the cells,
let the people out! Now!

853
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,800
He's dead.

854
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:42,100
Tarek, the man is dead.

855
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,600
We're going out now.

856
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,000
We're going through this door.

857
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:03,000
We can't get out of here.
We don't have a key for the elevator!

858
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:05,600
They'll just beat us up!

859
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:09,400
Nonsense! What's back there?
- The basement.

860
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,400
Supply corridors. You can go
directly to the Medical School.

861
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,600
Be quiet please or
I'll get into trouble.

862
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,500
Yeah, sure.

863
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:37,500
If you wait here for a moment,
I'll see if I can get Tarek.

864
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,600
Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

865
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:43,800
Fine.

866
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,200
Do you have a cell phone?
Mine's got no power.

867
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,800
Thanks, I'll make it quick.

868
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,200
No!

869
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,100
To the left!

870
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:47,000
We can't leave him lying there!

871
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:02,800
Bosch! You're one of us!
Stop them! That's an order!

872
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:07,700
You traitor pig!
I'll get you all!

873
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,200
They're breaking out! Come!

874
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,700
I'll get you!

875
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:32,800
The back way!

876
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,900
Mr. Berus, please be reasonable!
- Shut up!

877
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,300
Mr. Kamps, the experiment...
- Quiet! Tie them to the bars.

878
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:53,000
The others must be
in the Medical School.

879
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,700
There's only one way out.
They don't stand a chance.

880
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,200
Mr. Eckert, what happened here?

881
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,500
I didn't want this! I wanted...

882
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,100
I thought that...

883
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,000
Wait, Bosch!

884
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,900
It's over! I have...

885
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,800
Can you hear me?

886
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,900
There you are!

887
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,500
I told you, I'll get you!

888
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,500
On the floor, hands back!

889
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,000
No!

890
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,900
Stop it!

891
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,500
Give me the gun!
It's not real anyway!

892
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,200
Bitch!

893
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,400
The key, quick!

894
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,200
You started this!

895
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,800
You damned pig!
You killed Schutte!

896
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:44,900
Stop it.

897
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,300
It's over!

898
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,800
The sad outcome:
two dead, three injured...

899
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,500
...among them project leader
Professor Klaus Thon.

900
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,100
Obviously the experiment got
out of control after two days.

901
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,200
The district attorney is investigating
2 cases of suspected manslaughter...

902
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:23,800
...and several cases of mistreatment
and failure to provide assistance.

903
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,200
One of the test persons
has been arrested.

904
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:29,900
The project directors will probably
have to answer to a court.

905
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,400
According to statements by one
of the scientists involved...

906
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:34,400
...the escalation
could've been prevented...

907
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:37,300
...by earlier aborting the experiment.
