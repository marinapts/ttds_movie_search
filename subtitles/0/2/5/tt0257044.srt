1
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:39,307
There are many stories
about Michael Sullivan.

2
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,812
Some say he was a decent man.

3
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,193
Some say there was no good
in him at all.

4
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,116
But I once spent six weeks
on the road with him...

5
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,870
...in the winter of 1931 .

6
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,335
This is our story.

7
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:43,079
Thank you, sir. Much obliged.
Man dies in factory accident!

8
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,290
Get your paper here!
Hot off the press, only 5 cents!

9
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,339
Thanks, Mr. Miller.

10
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,681
I'll help you with it later.

11
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,433
You go fetch your father.

12
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,306
Pa?

13
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,856
Dinner's ready.

14
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,234
Thank you.

15
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,413
Bless us, O Lord, for thy gifts
we are about to receive...

16
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,333
...through the bounty of Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

17
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,681
-Michael?
-Sir?

18
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:35,603
It's a wake, so I don't want to see
those dice.

19
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,146
No, sir.

20
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,174
Hello.

21
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,646
I don't wanna go.

22
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:24,860
-Come on, it's all right.
-No. I'm scared.

23
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,716
Ice helps preserve the body.

24
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,410
So...

25
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:17,997
...who's got a hug
for a lonely old man?

26
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,793
Now then, which is which?
Don't help me.

27
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:27,006
-Peter and Michael.
-No!

28
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,426
Annie, Mike, good to see you.

29
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,804
-Did you bring the necessary?
-Yes.

30
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:39,185
If you'll excuse me, I have urgent
business with these young gentlemen.

31
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,484
-Yeah!
-Winner!

32
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,779
Call the cops!
I know hustlers when I see them.

33
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,867
-I don't hustle, old-timer.
-Pay the man.

34
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,456
Upstairs.
Jacket pocket, in my study.

35
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,625
Before I change my mind.

36
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,695
-Hello?
-Hello.

37
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,324
Remind me,
which little Sullivan are you?

38
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:41,622
-Michael, sir.
-Sir? You don't have to call me sir.

39
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,250
I'm not your pa.

40
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,126
No, Mr. Rooney.

41
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,754
Call me Connor.

42
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,966
No, call me Uncle Connor.

43
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,723
What do you want?

44
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,393
Mr. Rooney sent me to get his jacket.

45
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,065
You come back later, huh?

46
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,025
I'm busy.

47
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:15,364
Yes.... Sir.

48
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,754
Hello, hello.

49
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,759
I want to welcome all of you
to my home.

50
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:40,347
It's good to have so many friends
in this house again.

51
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,226
Since Mary died, it's....

52
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:49,148
Well, it's just been me and my boy
rattling around in these rooms.

53
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,235
I had this speech prepared,
but it would be...

54
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,488
...dishonest of me to say that
I knew Danny well.

55
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,242
But lose one of us, it hurts us all.

56
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:07,750
I'll tell you what I do remember, though,
and Finn will remember this too...

57
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,045
...and that's Danny
on the high school football team.

58
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,758
A championship game. Down six points,
1 0 seconds left to play...

59
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,762
...four yards to go,
Danny tackles his own quarterback.

60
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,104
Mistakes, you know....
We all make them. God knows.

61
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,942
Let's drink to Danny's honor.

62
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,197
Let's wake him to God and hope that he
gets to heaven...

63
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,492
...at least an hour before
the devil finds out he's dead.

64
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,912
-Amen.
-To Danny!

65
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:54,880
And now, I would like to ask
a dear and a trusted friend...

66
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,216
...Finn McGovern, to say a few words...

67
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,302
...words that I'll wager
got more poetry than mine.

68
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,388
Get over here.

69
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,980
Thank you, John.

70
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,570
"My brother Danny wasn't wise.

71
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,824
Nor was he gentle.

72
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,870
And with a skinful of liquor in him,
he was a pain in the ass.

73
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,669
But he was loyal and brave.

74
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,339
And he never told a lie.

75
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,053
He'd have enjoyed this party.

76
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:50,018
Me and the family, we wanna say
thank you to our generous host.

77
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,730
Where would this town be
without Mr. John Rooney?"

78
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:04,783
I've worked for you
for many years now, John.

79
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,121
Nearly half my life.

80
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,252
And we've never had a disagreement.

81
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,258
I've come to realize
that you rule this town...

82
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,926
...as God rules the earth.

83
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:30,017
-You give, and you take away--
-Lovely. Lovely speech.

84
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:59,379
I'm gonna bury my brother.
Then I'm gonna deal with you.

85
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,131
Sure, Finn, sure.

86
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,134
You'll take care of all of us.

87
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,553
Once you get a good night's sleep.

88
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,561
-He all right?
-Yeah, he's fine.

89
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,271
Just too much to drink.

90
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,440
I'll talk to him.

91
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,567
-Take Mike with you.
-No, Pa--

92
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,529
Take Mike with you.

93
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,822
Just talk, nothing more.

94
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,998
Why are you always smiling?

95
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,174
'Cause it's all so fucking hysterical.

96
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,143
Michael.

97
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,352
What?

98
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,441
I had a nightmare.
It was about Mr. Rooney's house.

99
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,486
It's just a house.

100
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,321
A big house.

101
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,532
Go back to sleep.

102
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,665
Is Mr. Rooney rich like the Babe?

103
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,875
Richer.

104
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,502
Are we rich?

105
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,045
No, stupid.

106
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,510
What's papa's job?

107
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,430
He works for Mr. Rooney.

108
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,016
Why?

109
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,521
Well, Papa didn't have a father...

110
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,899
...so Mr. Rooney looked after him.

111
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,401
I know that, but what's his job?

112
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,075
He goes on missions for Mr. Rooney.

113
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,288
They're very dangerous.
That's why he brings his gun.

114
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,003
Sometimes even the president
sends him on missions...

115
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,131
...'cause Papa was a war hero and all.

116
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,552
-You're just making that up.
-I am not.

117
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,934
It's all so fucking hysterical.

118
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,741
Peter, I can't come to your concert
tonight. I'm working.

119
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,286
Working at what?

120
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,250
Putting food on your plate, young man.

121
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,879
All right, boys, come on,
clear the plates.

122
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,263
You're a good lad.

123
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,644
-You want a shot?
-No.

124
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,652
We're just talking to him, right?

125
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,570
Sure.

126
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,021
Don't get me wrong, Finn.
I feel for you. I do.

127
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:23,443
You can't let a thing like that
give you cause to go mouthing off.

128
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,154
You and my dad,
you go back many years...

129
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,074
...and he is a just man.

130
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,659
So, what do you say?

131
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,331
Come on now, Finn.

132
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,917
Make this easy.

133
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,341
We can't hear you.

134
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,722
-All right.
-Good.

135
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,767
Thank you.

136
00:23:56,352 --> 00:24:01,481
I am sorry. I'm sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry for this misunderstanding.

137
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,567
And I'm sorry your brother was
such a fucking liar.

138
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,321
-My brother was not a liar.
-Excuse me?

139
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,407
To protect my family and keep my job,
I'll stay quiet.

140
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,369
But don't think I don't know
something's going on.

141
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:17,789
-Don't think I won't find out what it is.
-Whoa, buddy--

142
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:18,998
Easy, easy.

143
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,208
Easy.

144
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:25,130
We're just talking. You tell your father
my brother never stole from him.

145
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:31,219
I've checked the books. He never sold
booze to no one. lt's all accounted for.

146
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,180
-If he sold it, where's the money?
-Fuck should I know?

147
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:37,267
-Did you check his mattress?
-Maybe you should check yours.

148
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,061
There's something immoral here,
don't you think, Mike?

149
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,773
My beloved father throws your
undeserving little brother...

150
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:47,610
...the wake of his life, and this--
This is your thank-you?

151
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,613
-What a hideous world this is.
-You think you're so smart.

152
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:54,576
You think we don't know? You're
spending so much time in Chicago--

153
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,762
What was that?

154
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,097
We're out of here.

155
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:21,060
Jesus Christ, Connor,
what the hell are you thinking?!

156
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,412
Jesus.

157
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,415
Michael.

158
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,711
Are you hurt?

159
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,675
You saw everything?

160
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,225
Jesus.

161
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,895
You are not to speak of this to anyone.
You understand?

162
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,314
Not to anyone!

163
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,690
Who's this?

164
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,029
It's one of yours?

165
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,157
He must have been hiding in the car.

166
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,576
Well, can he keep a secret?

167
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,455
He's my son.

168
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,963
Well, that's good enough for me.

169
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,215
You take him home.

170
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,592
Think I'll walk.

171
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,512
Perfect night for a stroll.

172
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,836
Does Mama know?

173
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:17,010
Your mother knows I love Mr. Rooney.

174
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,846
We had nothing.

175
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:25,351
He gave us a home, a life.
We owe him.

176
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:35,862
Do you understand?

177
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,157
Yes.

178
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,829
Well, come on inside, then.

179
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,722
Boys, clear your plates, please.

180
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,265
I'll do it later.

181
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:50,311
-It's time for school now--
-It's only a plate!

182
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,996
What's he doing here?

183
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,249
Michael was hiding in the car...

184
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,626
...when I went out last night.

185
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,294
Jesus, Mike.

186
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,840
I've spoken to him.
It won't happen again.

187
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,386
Mom. Mom!

188
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,398
Just the feller....

189
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,777
Our secret, right?

190
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,323
I'm talking about the dice.

191
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:50,705
A man of honor always pays his debts.

192
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,167
And keeps his word.

193
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,719
I'm gonna be late for school.

194
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,414
How is Michael? ls he okay?

195
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,667
I've spoken to him.

196
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,252
He understands.

197
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,589
That's tough...

198
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:46,636
...seeing that for the first time.
Well, you turned out.

199
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,975
You can't protect them forever.

200
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:56,729
If it wasn't this,
it'd be something else.

201
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,982
Natural law.

202
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,529
Sons are put on this earth
to trouble their fathers.

203
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,043
John's also made it clear that
Finn McGovern's operation...

204
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,170
...will be divided up locally...

205
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:25,841
...among two territories that John
will select personally.

206
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,137
I'd like to take this moment
to thank Mr. Rance for...

207
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,183
...interrupting a busy travel schedule
to pay us a visit.

208
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,936
Thank you, Jack.

209
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:40,982
Mr. Rance met with John and me earlier
to make another bid...

210
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,317
...for our involvement in the unions.

211
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,487
And I told Mr. Rance
what I told him before:

212
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:50,408
What men do after work
is what made us rich.

213
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,411
No need to screw them at work
as well.

214
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,790
-Is there any other business?
-Yes.

215
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:03,963
Connor, is there something
you would like to say about last night?

216
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:13,472
I'd like to apologize for what happened.

217
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,351
Especially to you, Pa.

218
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,564
Two wakes in a month....
What can I say?

219
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,651
We lost a good man last night.

220
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,236
You think it's funny?

221
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,906
Try again.

222
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,869
I'd like to apologize--

223
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:44,420
You would like to apologize?
Try again.

224
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,603
Gentlemen...

225
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,983
...my apologies.

226
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,411
Is everyone clear about bit borrowers?

227
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,706
There have been far too many
debts outstanding.

228
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,709
-Mike....
-Just give me their names.

229
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,461
Tell me who to visit.

230
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,130
Thank you, gentlemen.

231
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,633
Come on upstairs.

232
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,476
Mike.

233
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,734
Dad forgot to give you this.

234
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,654
It's just a reminder for Tony Calvino.
He's light again.

235
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,365
Are you coming?

236
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:40,286
No, I'm under house arrest for a while.

237
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:45,166
Look, I'm sorry about last night. I am.

238
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:49,128
I was.... Yeah.

239
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,630
All right.

240
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:15,404
-Help you, sir? Or just looking?
-Here to see Tony Calvino.

241
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,948
Yeah, and who are you?

242
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,076
Mike Sullivan.

243
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,038
Yes, sir.

244
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,584
You gonna frisk me?

245
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,338
-Should l?
-It's a good idea.

246
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,678
That's the only one.

247
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:54,109
I mean, I'm a grown man
and this place is getting to me.

248
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,655
Every night there's trouble.

249
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:02,409
No one's got no dough,
but all the world's here wasting it.

250
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,038
Always money for frills and twists,
and never money for food.

251
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:10,084
Sometimes I despair the species,
you know?

252
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,881
Number 12 in the beauty parlor.
Who's the lucky face?

253
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:22,012
I'm not from here originally, but jobs
ain't hanging off trees, you know.

254
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,517
I'm a boxer by trade.
Nine consecutive titles.

255
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,894
That's a record in South Orange.

256
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,439
I'd make a pretty good bodyguard,
I think.

257
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:36,402
What I'm saying is,
is Mr. Rooney looking for anyone?

258
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:42,950
You know, anyone like me, for example?
Is there any chance you might ask him?

259
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,078
-Sure.
-Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

260
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:49,081
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

261
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:57,172
Mr. Calvino?
Mr. Calvino, Mike Sullivan's here.

262
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:00,467
-Shit.
-He wants to see you.

263
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:05,514
-Shit. ls he packing?
-Not anymore.

264
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,808
All right.

265
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,643
Show him in.

266
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:14,023
Hey, hey, hey.
You stick around, okay?

267
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,325
Hey!

268
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:28,621
How the hell are you?
Things good with the old man?

269
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,955
Yeah.

270
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:34,835
What brings you here?
Don't imagine it's the pussy.

271
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,050
-I have a letter for you from Mr. Rooney.
-Am I behind again?

272
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,643
-Am I in trouble?
-I don't know.

273
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,913
Michael.

274
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,770
No!

275
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:49,590
No! My God!

276
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,505
-Pa, I'm sorry.
-Stupid!

277
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:34,176
The kid would've talked. I'm sorry.

278
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,847
Goddamn you. Goddamn you!

279
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,479
I curse the fucking day you were born!

280
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,482
I curse it!

281
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,486
You!

282
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,328
Oh, Lord.

283
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:09,503
Oh, Lord. God help us.

284
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,713
God help us.

285
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,396
This house is not our home anymore.

286
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,399
It's just an empty building.

287
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,178
All right, you stay here.
You stay out of sight.

288
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,431
-Don't go, Pa. Don't go.
-Michael...

289
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,268
...when they find out we're gone,
they're gonna come after us.

290
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,812
I have to protect you now.

291
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,773
Please, Pa.

292
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,822
All right, here, take this.

293
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,408
-No. I don't want it.
-Take it.

294
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:26,955
-I don't want it.
-Boy, take it! You got six shots.

295
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:31,668
If I'm not back in half an hour, go tell
Reverend Lynch what's happened.

296
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,921
Do not go to Father Callaway.

297
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,621
I don't have any business with you,
Mr. Kelly.

298
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:11,416
But I have business with you, Mike.

299
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,211
Go ahead.

300
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,048
What is that?

301
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:23,178
25,000 dollars. Mr. Rooney wants you
to know there's more if you need it.

302
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:28,517
You have friends in lreland, Mike.
Why don't you take Peter and leave?

303
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,478
I can't take Peter.

304
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:36,149
He's dead.

305
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,445
-So where's Connor?
-He's in hiding.

306
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,865
-Where?
-You know I can't tell you that.

307
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,621
You think sticking a gun to my head
is gonna make any difference to me?

308
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:55,669
If I tell you, I'm a dead man anyway.
We both are.

309
00:45:55,837 --> 00:46:02,342
Think, Mike. Don't be stupid.
I'm just the messenger.

310
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,856
Then give Mr. Rooney a message for me.

311
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,774
What is it?

312
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,708
Give me the gun.

313
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,723
Where are we going?

314
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:51,683
To Chicago.

315
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:54,769
There's a man there who runs things.

316
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,939
I've done some work for him.

317
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,485
We have to find out where he stands.

318
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:06,490
Try to get some sleep.

319
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:46,840
I want you to wait for me here.

320
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,135
-Sure.
-I won't be long. You'll be all right?

321
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:54,264
-Yeah, I'll be all right.
-That's a good boy.

322
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:45,482
-Hello, Mike.
-Hello, fellas.

323
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:51,780
It's nice to see you. We heard what
happened. How you holding up?

324
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,324
I need to talk to Mr. Nitti.

325
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:59,079
-He's awful busy.
-I can wait.

326
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,083
Okay. Take the man to the top.

327
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,308
Certainly, sir.

328
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,236
Sorry to make you wait so long, Mike.
Come on in.

329
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,865
We all just heard what happened.

330
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,034
Jesus, I'm sorry, Mike.

331
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:25,665
Well, thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Nitti.

332
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,500
Come on, sit down.

333
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,169
-Like some coffee or...?
-No.

334
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,921
-You sure?
-Yes, thank you.

335
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:40,013
So, what can I do for you, Mike?

336
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,474
I'd like to work for you.

337
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,856
Well, that's very interesting.

338
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:55,862
And in return, I'd like you to turn a
blind eye to what I have to do.

339
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,781
And what is that?

340
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,328
Kill the man who murdered my family.

341
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,581
Is one more body
gonna make a difference?

342
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,710
This is a good proposal, Mr. Nitti.

343
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,714
I will work only for you,
and you know I can do a good job.

344
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:19,385
I respect you, Mike. I do.

345
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,891
We would like nothing more than to have
you come work for us. But not like this.

346
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,061
What you're asking me is impossible.

347
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,854
Is it?

348
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:37,403
Let me explain something to you that
maybe you haven't realized.

349
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,325
All these years, you've been living
under the protection...

350
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,744
...of people who care about you.

351
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:51,292
And those same people
are protecting you now, including me.

352
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:56,506
So if you go ahead with this,
if you open that door...

353
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,842
...you're walking through it alone.

354
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:06,057
And all that loyalty, all that trust,
will no longer exist for you.

355
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:14,399
And Mike, you won't make it.
Not on your own.

356
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,319
And not with a little boy.

357
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,201
You're protecting him already?

358
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,331
We're protecting our interests, Mike.

359
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:35,128
I drove all through the night
to see you.

360
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:41,092
I appreciate that.
Now I suggest you drive yourself back.

361
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:51,352
Go home, Mike.
Go home and bury your wife and child.

362
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,479
With our blessing.

363
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:59,277
It won't be that simple.

364
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,609
You heard?

365
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,863
Dad, listen to me.
He's in the building.

366
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:49,869
-You can end this now. Take him now.
-Connor, get upstairs.

367
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,048
God help me.

368
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:07,178
God help me. What do I do?

369
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:11,182
You think objectively.

370
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,601
And you make your choice.

371
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:20,066
What would you do if Sullivan
were just some guy?

372
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:26,864
God help me.

373
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,492
-Make it quick.
-And the kid?

374
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:33,579
Oh, Christ. No, no.

375
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:39,502
One day the kid becomes a man....
Think he won't remember?

376
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,589
I said not the kid.

377
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,051
All right.

378
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,970
I know who to call.

379
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:54,684
There's a guy who's done some work
for us in the past.

380
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,644
He's gifted.

381
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:13,244
Excuse me, ma'am. Press. Press.

382
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,955
He was raping my wife.
He raped my wife.

383
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:19,625
Come on, come on,
you're treading on the evidence here.

384
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:30,511
Two minutes.

385
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,889
You got it, Mr. Maguire.

386
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,685
Harlen Maguire.
Good evening, Mr. Nitti.

387
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,816
Sixteen hundred.

388
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,153
Sixteen hundred dollars is my rate,
Mr. Nitti.

389
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:13,406
And what I make on
the photographs is mine.

390
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,077
No, never met him.

391
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,620
But I know his work.

392
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,629
He traveling alone?

393
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,842
How old?

394
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,683
What do I do with the kid?

395
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,692
Will do.

396
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,737
Thank you.

397
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:03,748
You remember your aunt Sarah?
Your mom's sister?

398
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:09,879
She lives in Perdition.
She'll take you in.

399
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:13,799
Where is it?

400
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,260
Right by the lake.

401
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:22,516
We went there once, all of us,
when you were 4, maybe 5.

402
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,479
It's beautiful.

403
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,899
You remember?

404
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,738
The place with the dog.

405
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,570
-Hello?
-Sarah.

406
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,489
Mike. Oh, thank God.

407
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,908
I want you to know we're okay.

408
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:45,659
Where are you?

409
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,704
We're on our way to your place,
if that's all right.

410
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,291
Of course.
I'll be back there in two days.

411
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,542
How's Michael?

412
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,920
He's all right.

413
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,841
How was it?

414
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,345
Oh, Mike....

415
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:10,851
Hello?

416
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,608
We'll see you soon.

417
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,048
-Hello, operator?
-Yes, sir.

418
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:44,301
I was just cut off,
could you reconnect me?

419
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:54,622
You hungry?

420
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,582
No.

421
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,128
Might not be another diner for a while,
so you should eat.

422
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:02,922
I'm not hungry.

423
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,674
I just wanna read.

424
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:52,323
-Slow night, huh?
-You kidding? This is busy.

425
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:55,618
-What can I get you?
-You got a special?

426
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,453
Everything's special.

427
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:01,832
-Is that so?
-Everything except the food.

428
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,710
Everything except the food?

429
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,757
-You ought to be on the stage.
-Don't I know it.

430
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:14,553
Give me some of that honey-dipped
fried chicken and a black coffee.

431
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,847
Duck soup.

432
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:29,068
Don't mind me, sir.

433
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:34,156
It's a free country.
Used to be, anyhow.

434
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,203
No, thank you, sir.

435
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:55,552
Is that your profession
or your pleasure?

436
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,639
Both, I guess.

437
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:03,352
To be paid to do what you love....
Ain't that the dream?

438
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,650
I guess so.

439
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:11,860
Yourself?

440
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,822
I'm a salesman.
Machine parts.

441
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,201
Machine parts.

442
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:23,706
-That's wonderful.
-I assure you, it is not.

443
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:28,752
-So who do you work for?
-Can you keep a secret?

444
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,089
I'm press.

445
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,925
Which paper?

446
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:39,638
All over.
I'm something of a rarity.

447
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,141
How's that?

448
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:44,351
I shoot the dead.

449
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,817
Dead bodies, that is.
I don't kill them.

450
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,489
I should hope not.

451
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:04,705
Always fascinated me,
the look of them, you know?

452
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:09,793
-You ever seen one?
-Yeah.

453
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,045
Sorry for you.

454
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,465
Terrible thing.

455
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:18,260
But it sure makes you feel alive,
don't it?

456
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:26,351
I'll drink to that.

457
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,188
Stuff makes you sweat, huh?

458
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,734
Yeah, piss too.

459
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:37,196
Excuse me, ma'am,
can you help me out here?

460
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,448
Just through here.

461
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:42,785
Hey!

462
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:45,078
Look out, there.

463
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:05,933
-Thanks, Ruby.
-Good night.

464
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,118
Forgot to leave a tip.

465
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,175
-Get down.
-Why? What's going on?

466
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,760
Get down!

467
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:45,889
Hey, what do you think you're--?

468
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,582
Get out of the car.

469
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:15,419
Get out of the car!
When I say get down, you get down.

470
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:18,672
Don't ask questions. When I say we're
stopping to eat, you stay with me.

471
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,050
You listen to me from now on,
or you start taking care of yourself.

472
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:26,096
I can take care of myself fine!
You never wanted me along anyway.

473
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:29,141
-You think it's my fault this happened.
-Stop it.

474
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:30,767
It was not your fault!

475
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,149
None of this is your fault.

476
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:42,654
-Just take me to Aunt Sarah's.
-I can't take you there.

477
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,656
Not now.

478
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:50,078
-Why?
-He knows that's where we're going.

479
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,624
So, what are you gonna do?

480
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:59,254
Something I can't do alone.

481
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:05,344
You have to listen to me now, okay?

482
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:08,305
Or else both of us are dead.

483
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,267
I have to make Capone give up Connor.

484
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:15,812
There's one thing Chicago loves
more than anything...

485
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,606
...and that's their money.

486
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:23,153
They've got it in banks all over the
state. We have to find it and take it.

487
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:28,867
-Are you gonna help me?
-Yes.

488
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:33,747
Then I have to teach you something.

489
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,294
-You know what the clutch is?
-Sure I know what the clutch is.

490
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:42,464
-What is the clutch?
-The clutch, it.... It clutches.

491
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,259
Right, it clutches.
Which of those pedals is the clutch?

492
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,428
That's the gas.

493
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:51,431
Gas. I'll show you.

494
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,141
There. Right there, see?

495
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,311
There's the clutch,
and it does the clutching.

496
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,695
Let's go again.

497
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:20,002
Release gas, clutch,
shift gear, hit gas....

498
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,211
Shift.

499
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,764
-Can I make one suggestion?
-No.

500
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:35,225
I'm doing this.

501
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:49,072
Hey, 45 miles an hour,
that's a little fast.

502
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:51,950
Look out for the tractor, Mike.

503
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,786
Michael, look out for the tractor.

504
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:58,999
Watch out for the tractor.
Watch out for the tractor!

505
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:05,589
-We made it.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, we made it.

506
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:22,647
No more excuses. I've told you once,
now I'm telling you again--

507
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,734
-I'm looking for a Mr. McDougal.
-Just one moment.

508
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,737
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

509
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,990
I wasn't expecting another
deposit until the end of the month.

510
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,994
Actually, I'm making a withdrawal.
I want dirty money only.

511
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:40,999
Everything you're holding for Capone
that's off the books. Open the safe.

512
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:46,254
You're insane.
You know they'll find out who you are.

513
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,341
The name's Sullivan.
You want me to spell it?

514
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,470
Open the box.

515
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,389
They'll kill you. They're animals.

516
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:00,143
You don't say. Put it in.

517
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,149
That's for you.

518
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:09,611
Call it a handling charge.
Tell Chicago I took it.

519
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:15,242
But if I read about this in the papers,
if I read about the savings of farmers...

520
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:19,830
...being wiped out by a heartless
bank robber, I won't be happy.

521
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,625
Good afternoon.

522
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:26,128
You really trust me not to say
anything?

523
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,213
Always trust a bank manager.

524
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,606
There's no rush.

525
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:02,557
-Coffee?
-Thank you.

526
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:12,108
So, what brings you guys
to the middle of nowhere?

527
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,444
We're bank robbers.

528
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,781
We're just passing through.

529
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:27,165
So when do I get my share
of the money?

530
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:35,298
Well, how much do you want?

531
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,970
Two hundred dollars.

532
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,683
Okay. Deal.

533
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:58,280
-Could I have had more?
-You'll never know.

534
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:14,462
Come on, come on.

535
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:32,981
How much did they take?

536
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,607
How much?

537
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:38,403
Okay, answer me this:
What are we paying you for?

538
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,363
-Where's my father?
-What's this?

539
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:44,784
Why is no one talking to me?
I feel like a fucking prisoner.

540
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:48,997
I told you. You are not a prisoner.
You are being protected.

541
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:52,375
-This is what your father wants.
-I can look after myself.

542
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,045
No, you can't. This is the point.

543
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:58,965
You're a big baby who doesn't know
his thumb from his dick.

544
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,175
Fuck you.

545
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:05,347
The only reason you're still alive
is because you're John Rooney's son.

546
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,850
You're being a little
shortsighted here, Frank.

547
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,811
My father is an old man.

548
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,647
I am the future.

549
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,651
So don't you ever talk to me
that way again.

550
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,877
Maguire, do what you have to.
Find them.

551
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:40,507
I'm sorry, Mr. Sullivan,
there is no money.

552
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:44,803
No-- I can get you money, I just--

553
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,388
It won't be Chicago's.

554
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,474
They took it all out two days ago.

555
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,773
-Who authorized it?
-The accountant.

556
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,526
What's his name?

557
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,153
This is Mr. Rance in the bridal suite.

558
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:06,741
Before you proffer your congratulations,
there's no Mrs. Rance with me...

559
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,286
...and I'm all the better for it.
Listen carefully...

560
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,039
...because I am in no mood.

561
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:15,333
I'm going to say this only once.

562
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:19,462
I would like a boiled egg,
and I want it runny.

563
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:24,509
Pa, can we sleep in a motel room
tonight instead of the car?

564
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,886
Yeah, that would be nice.

565
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,816
How many more days
you gonna want me, mister?

566
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:43,903
Can't we close the curtains,
even for a little while?

567
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:47,699
I can't get no sleep
with all that light.

568
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:51,536
You see anything,
you hit that horn twice.

569
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:54,247
Don't get out of the car,
no matter what.

570
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,467
Bye.

571
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:15,059
-Ready?
-I'm ready.

572
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:32,494
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

573
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:34,245
Runny.

574
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,222
It's open.

575
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:58,561
Top marks for speed,
no marks for cookery.

576
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:02,398
What, may I ask, do you call this?

577
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:03,858
Put it down.

578
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:07,362
-Mr. Sullivan.
-Mr. Rance.

579
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,197
How did you find me?

580
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:14,410
This is the best hotel in the area.
And you are so very...particular.

581
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,746
Yes, indeed, Mr. Sullivan.

582
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:20,583
May I ask you to lower your weapon.

583
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:23,795
Thank you.
Now, what do you want?

584
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:25,171
Information.

585
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:35,098
I can't give you the files.

586
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:37,016
All right, all right.

587
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:40,311
They're in the next room.

588
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,612
-In here.
-Bring it in.

589
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,080
I can't see.

590
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:06,588
What will you accomplish by
interfering with our business?

591
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:11,092
-This has nothing to do with business.
-It's all business. You fail to grasp that.

592
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,012
And in business, you must
have something to trade.

593
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,598
And you, Mr. Sullivan,
have nothing to trade.

594
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,602
Especially not for anyone
as valuable as Connor Rooney.

595
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,186
I don't understand.

596
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,106
Opening bell on Wall Street.

597
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,360
Come on, open it.

598
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,823
Which one is it?

599
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:56,554
No, no, not it.

600
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:01,142
Tried that one already.

601
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,270
Better start over.

602
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,230
You got one more try.

603
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:12,153
There it is.

604
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:29,814
I'm okay. Watch the road!

605
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:54,714
Pa! Pa, are you okay?

606
01:24:56,467 --> 01:24:59,635
Pa!

607
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:13,941
Help!

608
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,193
Help us!

609
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:20,573
Help!

610
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,158
Help us!

611
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:14,544
When are you two heading out?

612
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,466
We've stayed long enough.

613
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:23,594
We don't wanna cause you any trouble.

614
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:28,224
No trouble so far.

615
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:34,355
He's a good worker.

616
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,067
You have any kids?

617
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,027
No.

618
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,697
We met too late.

619
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:48,619
He dotes on you.

620
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,251
You don't see it.

621
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:29,827
Hello.

622
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:32,788
I had a bad dream.

623
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,833
You wanna talk about it?

624
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:41,380
Well, come on in. Take a seat...

625
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,674
...if you want.

626
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:57,939
Math, huh?

627
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,899
Yeah.

628
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:01,943
I always hated it.

629
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,153
Me too.

630
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,286
So, what do you like?

631
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:15,081
Huh?

632
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:20,044
What subjects do you like--?
Did you like...in school?

633
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,840
Bible history, maybe.

634
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:27,885
Why?

635
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,013
I like the stories.

636
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:35,935
Peter was good at math.

637
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,898
Was he?

638
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,368
Did you like Peter more than me?

639
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,498
No.

640
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:02,003
No, Michael.

641
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:06,424
I loved you both the same.

642
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,261
But you were....

643
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:15,016
You were different with me.

644
01:29:15,726 --> 01:29:17,768
Was l?

645
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,740
Well....

646
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:37,246
Maybe it was because Peter was just
such a sweet boy, you know?

647
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,877
And you....

648
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,674
You were more like me.

649
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:55,431
And I didn't want you to be.

650
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:04,732
I didn't mean to be...different.

651
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:10,780
Okay.

652
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,417
Good night, Pa.

653
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,711
Good night.

654
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:38,951
Michael, wake up.
Get your things.

655
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:40,995
We're leaving.

656
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:44,832
We left you something.

657
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:56,070
Hello, John.

658
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,665
You're a smart man, Michael.

659
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:12,086
I wanna talk.

660
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,546
Here?

661
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:16,799
Downstairs.

662
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:47,121
I didn't think I'd see you again.

663
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,333
Read this.

664
01:33:52,002 --> 01:33:55,254
Connor's been stealing from you
for years.

665
01:33:55,630 --> 01:34:01,051
He keeps accounts open under the names
of dead men. Men like the McGoverns.

666
01:34:02,804 --> 01:34:06,473
I stood there and helped him
kill Finn to line his own pockets.

667
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:10,436
I thought I was working for you,
but I wasn't.

668
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:12,563
You think I'd give up my son?

669
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,773
He was betraying you.

670
01:34:15,275 --> 01:34:17,484
I know.

671
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,611
Now, listen to me.

672
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:23,949
I tried to avoid more bloodshed.
You wouldn't accept that...

673
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:28,329
...so I did what was necessary.
But I've always loved you like a son.

674
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:33,125
And now I'm telling you,
leave before it's too late.

675
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:37,421
Think.

676
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:42,051
They're protecting him now, but when
you're gone, they won't need him.

677
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:46,597
-This ends with Connor dead regardless.
-That may be...

678
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:50,017
...but you are asking me...

679
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:53,687
...to give you the key to his room
so you can walk in...

680
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:57,358
...put a gun to his head
and pull the trigger. I can't do that.

681
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:02,279
-He murdered Annie and Peter.
-There are only murderers in this room.

682
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:05,824
Michael, open your eyes.

683
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:10,037
This is the life we chose,
the life we lead.

684
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:16,668
And there is only one guarantee:
None of us will see heaven.

685
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:19,088
Michael could.

686
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:25,386
Then do everything that you can
to see that that happens.

687
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:29,139
Leave.
I'm begging you.

688
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:32,101
It's the only way.

689
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:36,480
And if I go?

690
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:39,817
Then...

691
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:42,778
...I will mourn...

692
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:45,781
...the son I lost.

693
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:46,133
What are you gonna do?

694
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:51,096
Just one last thing,
and then it's done.

695
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:59,188
Go back to bed, Michael.

696
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:20,055
I'm glad it's you.

697
01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:37,382
I understand.

698
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:43,138
But then Al wants your assurance
that after that, it's over.

699
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:51,897
The Lexington Hotel, room 1432.

700
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,568
Is that the house?

701
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:27,988
That's it.

702
01:45:30,866 --> 01:45:33,118
I knew there was a dog.

703
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:22,125
Sarah? lt's me, Mike.
We're here.

704
01:47:54,176 --> 01:47:55,802
Smile.

705
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:24,247
Give me the gun.

706
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:25,874
Michael.

707
01:48:29,628 --> 01:48:30,795
Michael...

708
01:48:31,714 --> 01:48:33,798
...don't you do this.

709
01:48:34,842 --> 01:48:36,593
Give me the gun, Michael.

710
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:42,015
Come on.

711
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:44,851
Give me the gun.

712
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:01,326
I couldn't do it.

713
01:49:03,829 --> 01:49:05,705
I know.

714
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:16,466
-Pa.
-I'm sorry.

715
01:49:16,634 --> 01:49:19,552
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

716
01:49:24,683 --> 01:49:26,392
I'm sorry.

717
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,733
Pa.

718
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:39,197
Pa!

719
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,041
Pa.

720
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:55,088
Pa! Pa!

721
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:48,433
I saw then
that my father's only fear...

722
01:50:48,684 --> 01:50:52,020
...was that his son
would follow the same road.

723
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:57,483
And that was the last time
I ever held a gun.

724
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:31,225
People always thought
I grew up on a farm.

725
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:37,231
And I guess, in a way, I did.

726
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:42,695
But I lived a lifetime before that...

727
01:51:42,863 --> 01:51:45,698
...in those six weeks on the road...

728
01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:48,701
...in the winter of 1931 .

729
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:02,548
When people ask me if Michael Sullivan
was a good man...

730
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:06,552
...or if there was just no good
in him at all...

731
01:52:07,388 --> 01:52:09,889
...I always give the same answer.

732
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:14,852
I just tell them...

733
01:52:16,271 --> 01:52:18,731
..."He was my father."

734
01:56:55,842 --> 01:56:56,842
