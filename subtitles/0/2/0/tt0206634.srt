1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,900
Day 1,000
of the siege of Seattle.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,700
The Muslim community
demands an end

3
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
to the Army's occupation of mosques.

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,100
The Homeland Security bill is ratified.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
After eight years,
British borders will remain closed.

6
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,900
The deportation of illegal immigrants
will continue.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,900
Good morning. Our lead story.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,200
The world was stunned today
by the death of Diego Ricardo,

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,400
the youngest person on the planet.

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,700
Baby Diego was stabbed outside a bar
in Buenos Aires

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,300
after refusing to sign an autograph.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,600
Witnesses at the scene say...

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,800
Excuse me.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,300
...that Diego spat in the face of a fan
who asked for an autograph.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,800
He was killed in the ensuing brawl.
The fan was later beaten to death...

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,000
Coffee, please. Black.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,400
...by the angry crowd.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,900
Born in 2009,
the son of Marcello and Sylvia Ricardo,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,500
a working-class couple from Mendoza,

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,800
he struggled all his life
with the celebrity status

21
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,900
thrust upon him
as the world's youngest person.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,100
Diego Ricardo,
the youngest person on the planet

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,100
was 18 years, 4 months,

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,900
20 days, 16 hours and 8 minutes old.

25
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,200
Throughout his life,
Diego Ricardo was a tragic reminder

26
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,300
of the 18 years of infertility
that humanity has endured

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,600
and its effect upon the world we now live in.

28
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,200
It seems that the mantle of the world's
youngest human has passed to a woman.

29
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,700
She is 18 years, 5 months and 11 days old.

30
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,900
- Faron.
- Mr. Griffiths.

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,700
I seem to be more affected
by Baby Diego's death than I realized, sir.

32
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,000
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate it
if I could finish my day's work at home.

33
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,400
...generation needs
to reject family and society.

34
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,900
- He's my dentist.
- She's my house cleaner.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,500
- He's the waiter.
- She's my cousin.

36
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,300
They are illegal immigrants.

37
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,500
To hire, feed or shelter
illegal immigrants is a crime.

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
It's your life.

39
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,700
It's your choice.

40
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,100
Hey, amigo!

41
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,500
Jasper!

42
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,100
Good to see you. Come on.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
You know who did it?

44
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,900
Islamic? Fishes? Fuck knows.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,700
I'll bet it was the government.

46
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,700
Every time one of our politicians
is in trouble, a bomb explodes.

47
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,700
It's the second time in a month.

48
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,700
- You okay?
- It was horrible.

49
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,900
I'm glad you don't take
cream or sugar, amigo.

50
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,100
Losing you and Baby Diego
on the same day would be too hard to bear.

51
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, that was even worse,
everybody crying.

52
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,500
I mean, Baby Diego, come on.
That guy was a wanker.

53
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,100
Yeah, but he was the youngest wanker
on Earth.

54
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,600
Pull my finger. Quick, quick!

55
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,300
Jasper...

56
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
Fucking hell! That's disgusting!

57
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,800
Illegal immigrants. Taking them to Bexhill.

58
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,700
Poor fugees.

59
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
After escaping the worst atrocities
and finally making it to England,

60
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,900
our government hunts them down
like cockroaches.

61
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,900
- Any girls?
- No.

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,500
What about the one we had lunch with?
Lauren?

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,300
Lorna. That was ages ago.

64
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,500
- I liked her. What happened?
- She decided to renounce.

65
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,100
Renouncers? Are those the ones
that kneel down for a month for salvation?

66
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,900
No. They're the Repenters.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,200
The Renouncers flagellate themselves
for the forgiveness of humanity.

68
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,500
Oh, right.

69
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,600
Dating ain't what it used to be, is it, amigo?

70
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
- What'd you do on your birthday?
- Nothing.

71
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,500
Come on. You must've done something.

72
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,200
No. Same as every other day.

73
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,600
Woke up, felt like shit,
went to work, felt like shit.

74
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,600
That's called a hangover, amigo.

75
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,100
At least with a hangover, I feel something.

76
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,200
Honestly, Jasper, sometimes...

77
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,300
You could always come and live with us.

78
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,500
Yeah, but if I did that,
I wouldn't have anything to look forward to.

79
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,100
Look who it is. It's Theo.

80
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,900
- Hey, Janice, how you doing?
- It's Theo.

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,900
Your rebel with a lost cause.

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
She loves this color.

83
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,400
Don't you, darling? You love it.

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,900
"Is there a chance it will not work for me?

85
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,200
"There have been no cases
of anyone surviving

86
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,600
"who has taken the preparation."

87
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,200
Daddy government hands out suicide kits
and anti-depressants in the rations,

88
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
but ganja is still illegal.

89
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,600
Most of my weed goes to Bexhill now.

90
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,400
This bloke buys it from me
and smuggles it in.

91
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,400
Guess what he does? His real job?

92
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
Immigration cop.

93
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,700
Bravo!

94
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,800
One of the many perks of having
a refugee camp in the neighborhood.

95
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Come on, taste that.

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,300
Cough.

97
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,900
- Cough?
- Cough.

98
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,100
You taste it? Strawberries.

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,800
This is Strawberry Cough.

100
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,900
So, Human Project is having this dinner

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,500
and all the wisest men
in the world are there...

102
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,300
"Human Project."
Why do people believe this crap?

103
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,100
You know, even if these people existed
with these facilities in secret locations...

104
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Fuck me, that's strong.

105
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,800
Even if they discovered
the cure for infertility, it doesn't matter.

106
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,100
Too late. The world went to shit.

107
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,300
You know what?

108
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,100
It was too late before the infertility thing
happened, for fuck's sake.

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,300
I was just trying to tell a joke, man.

110
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
I'm sorry. Go on.

111
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,300
- No, I'm not telling it now.
- No, come on, Jasper.

112
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,800
- No. Fuck it. I'm not fucking telling you.
- It's all right. Go on.

113
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,300
Okay. The Human Project
gives this great big dinner

114
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,900
for all the scientists and sages in the world.

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
They're tossing around theories
about the ultimate mystery,

116
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,600
why are women infertile?
Why can't we make babies anymore?

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,700
Some of them say it's genetic experiments,

118
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
gamma rays, pollution. Same old, same old.

119
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,000
Anyway, in the corner,
this Englishman's sitting.

120
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
He hasn't said a word.
He's just tucking into his dinner.

121
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
So they decide to ask him.

122
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,100
They say, "Well, why do you think
we can't make babies anymore?"

123
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,600
And he looks up at them,
and he's chewing on this great big wing,

124
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,400
and he says, "I haven't the faintest idea,"
he said.

125
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,400
"But this stork is quite tasty, isn't it?"

126
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,100
Eating a fucking stork.

127
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,000
Eating the stork.

128
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,700
Italia.

129
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,100
You okay, amigo?

130
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Yeah. My ears are still ringing from earlier.

131
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,700
Well, a little Zen music
won't bother you, then, will it?

132
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,700
Good morning.
The time is 7:59 a.m.

133
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,200
British citizens, hold out

134
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,600
your I.D. cards.
All others, follow instructions.

135
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,400
What the fuck?

136
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,700
Move along! Move along!

137
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,400
This is him.

138
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
- Get your fucking head down!
- Walk!

139
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,700
- Get your fucking head down!
- Okay. Okay.

140
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,100
- Get in!
- Get him in! Get him in!

141
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,100
Get his fucking legs.

142
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,500
Go, go, go, go!

143
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,000
You are under the jurisdiction
of the Fishes.

144
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,900
The Fishes are at war
with the British government

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,300
until they recognize equal rights
for every immigrant in Britain.

146
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,700
We're not gonna hurt you.
We just want to talk.

147
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
But don't do anything stupid.

148
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,400
- Uncover him.
- It isn't safe.

149
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,600
Do it.

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,700
Hello, Theo.

151
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,700
It's me, Theo. It's Julian.

152
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,100
You scared the shit out of me.

153
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry about the theatrics,
but we had no choice.

154
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,400
The police have been
a pain in the ass lately.

155
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,900
How have you been?

156
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,600
Fantastic. Couldn't be better.

157
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
Cut the lights.

158
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
The police keep using
that old photo of you in the posters.

159
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,700
It doesn't do you justice.

160
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,500
What do the police know about justice?

161
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,700
What exactly is it you guys do, anyway?

162
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,300
The Fishes fight for equal rights
for every immigrant in Britain!

163
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,500
He knows what we do.

164
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,200
I know you almost blew me up
in a coffee shop yesterday.

165
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
My ears are still ringing.

166
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,700
- We don't bomb.
- That was the government.

167
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,900
That's what they do to spread the fear.

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What about Liverpool?

169
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,600
After Liverpool,
we stopped bombing.

170
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,400
We started speaking to the people.

171
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
And they're joining us, Theo.
British people, too.

172
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,900
I don't talk politics.

173
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,900
- That's all you ever used to do.
- That was 20 years ago.

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm a lot more successful now.

175
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,700
Come on, Theo. Walk with me.

176
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,200
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Come on!

177
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,500
- You're smoking?
- Yeah. It's not working.

178
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,500
I heard about your mother. I'm sorry.

179
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,100
Were your parents in New York
when it happened?

180
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,900
- Yeah.
- Shit.

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
Yeah, well, that's the world we live in now,
isn't it?

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,400
Why am I here, Jules?

183
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,600
I need your help. I need transit papers.

184
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,000
Not for me. A girl, she's a fugee.

185
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,000
Need to get her to the coast,
past security checkpoints.

186
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,700
I haven't seen you for nearly 20 years
and you come asking me for transit papers?

187
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,400
- Can you do it?
- I don't see how.

188
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,000
You could ask your cousin.

189
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,700
The government finances his
Ark of the Arts. He has access to papers.

190
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,300
- Yeah, but he'd never do it.
- He would if you asked him.

191
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,900
I can't. It's too dangerous.

192
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,900
I can get you 5,000.
I know you need the money.

193
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,200
What are you talking about?

194
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
- I don't fucking need your money.
- Right. Sorry.

195
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,700
My mistake.

196
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,500
You know that ringing in your ears? That...

197
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,400
That's the sound of the ear cells dying.
Like their swan song.

198
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Once it's gone,
you'll never hear that frequency again.

199
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,700
Enjoy it while it lasts.

200
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,900
This never fucking happened,

201
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,100
so don't go telling tales,
'cause we'll be watching you.

202
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,500
At work, when you sleep,

203
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,000
when you have a piss, we'll be watching.
All the fucking time.

204
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,000
Jeez, your breath stinks.

205
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

206
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,500
It was Julian's idea bringing you here.
She put herself at great risk.

207
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,700
Now you know about the five grand
we can offer you.

208
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,900
So if you change your mind,

209
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,500
pin this to the notice board at Camden tube.
We'll do the rest.

210
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
Here you are. Bus fare.

211
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,800
Earthquakes! Pollution!

212
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,800
Disease and famine!

213
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,000
Our sins have encouraged God's wrath!

214
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,500
And in his anger he has taken away
his most precious gift to us!

215
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,200
Mr. Faron, the minister is expecting you.
This way, sir.

216
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm afraid this is a non-smoking facility.

217
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,500
You got something in your teeth.

218
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,000
If you'll excuse me.

219
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,100
Couldn't save La Piet.
Smashed up before we got there.

220
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Pretty rummy, huh?

221
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,500
My mom had a plastic one in the bathroom.

222
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,900
It was a lamp.

223
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,600
Good to see you, Theo.

224
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
We got to keep Las Meninas
and a few other Velsquezes,

225
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,300
but we only got a hold of two Goyas.
That thing in Madrid was a real blow to art.

226
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,700
Not to mention people.

227
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,100
How's Martha?

228
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,400
She's doing her animal charity thing.
Sends her love.

229
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,400
- Give her my best.
- Yes.

230
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,400
Why did you come, Theo?

231
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
Well, the thing is,

232
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,300
I met this girl.

233
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Cute?

234
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,100
Beautiful.

235
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,500
Is it serious?

236
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Very.

237
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,300
She's got this brother in Brighton and
she hasn't seen him for about five years,

238
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,100
and he's not doing too good.

239
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,600
I mean, pretty sick.

240
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,000
- I don't think he's gonna make it.
- Sorry.

241
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,500
I've got money.
I was just hoping that you might...

242
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,500
I was hoping you could get us
the transit papers to get to the coast.

243
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,300
- Transit papers? That's quite a favor.
- I know.

244
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
Highly controlled.

245
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,900
Alex, take your pills.

246
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,300
Alex.

247
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,700
Alex?

248
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Alex!

249
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,000
Come with me.

250
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,700
I'm really sorry, Nigel.
I just don't know who else to ask.

251
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,300
I'll see what I can do.

252
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
What?

253
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,900
You kill me.

254
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,300
A hundred years from now,

255
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,100
there won't be one sad fuck
to look at any of this.

256
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
What keeps you going?

257
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,600
You know what it is, Theo?

258
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,800
I just don't think about it.

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
- Where's Julian?
- She couldn't make it. Sends her best.

260
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,800
Here's a photo of the girl and her name.

261
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,100
Hang on. We got a problem.

262
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,800
All I could get were joint transit papers,
which means I would have to escort the girl.

263
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
Will you?

264
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
For a couple more grand.

265
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Julian thinks very highly of you.

266
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,100
Does she?

267
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah.

268
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,000
Thanks again.

269
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,100
Go on, stay with her.

270
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,700
Stay with her. Stay with her. Yes!

271
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,800
Have you seen this dog?

272
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,900
I'll be one minute.

273
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,600
Billy! I'm in a rush, mate.

274
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,900
Okay, Theo. He'll see to you.
He'll see to you.

275
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,100
I'm in a rush. Come on. Come on.

276
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,500
That's 70 quid.

277
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,400
Shit.

278
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,100
- She's my house cleaner.
- He's the plumber.

279
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,300
Jesus.

280
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
- He's my dentist.
- He's the waiter.

281
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,800
She's my cousin.

282
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
They are illegal immigrants.

283
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,700
To hire, feed
or shelter illegal immigrants is a crime.

284
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Protect Britain.

285
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,500
Report all illegal immigrants.

286
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,100
Did you get the papers?

287
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,000
Lovely to see you, too.

288
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,000
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

289
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,100
Just like the old days, back of the bus.

290
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,600
Yeah, except we're the old farts now.

291
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,100
- You're looking good.
- Right.

292
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,900
Seriously. Look at me.

293
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,600
It's hard for me to look at you.

294
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,100
He had your eyes.

295
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
You know, I never understood
how you got over it so quickly.

296
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,600
You think I got over it?

297
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,000
No one could get over it.
I live with it. I think about him every day.

298
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,200
Come on, I mean the way you just...

299
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
You don't have a monopoly on suffering,
you know.

300
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
You always carried his memory
like a ball and chain...

301
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,900
What do you fucking know
about my memories?

302
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,500
- You don't know what I feel or what...
- Move!

303
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,700
Yeah, there you go.

304
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,400
That's what you always do.
When it gets tough, you walk away.

305
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,800
This is our stop.

306
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,500
Thelonius!

307
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,300
So why did you come to me?

308
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,500
You could have found other ways
to get transit papers.

309
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Probably.

310
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,100
- So why me?
- I trust you.

311
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,900
- And what happens after?
- You take a train back. It'll be safer.

312
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
No, I mean what happens to us?

313
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
I don't know.

314
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,700
Theo, come on. You came for the money.

315
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,100
Did I?

316
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Theo?

317
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,100
- You got my money?
- See?

318
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,700
We'll take you down to the first checkpoint
on the Canterbury Road,

319
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
then you and Kee are on your own.

320
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,100
Well, this is obviously the elite unit.

321
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,500
- This is Miriam.
- Hi.

322
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,700
- Is this the girl?
- Kee, this is Theo.

323
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,700
What the fuck you staring at?

324
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,000
Apparently the pleasure's all mine.

325
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,500
Are we planning a sing-along?

326
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,200
Good. I'm gonna take a nap.

327
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,100
The afternoon
is looking good here on Radio Avalon.

328
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,500
And now one for all the nostalgics
out there,

329
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,700
a blast from the past
all the way back from 2003.

330
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,400
That beautiful time
when people refused to accept

331
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,800
the future was just around the corner.

332
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,100
Hey.

333
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,700
You're snoring.

334
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,500
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were. He always snored.

335
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,900
Where are we?

336
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,500
Canterbury. We're close.

337
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,100
Anyone know
if there's a hotel around here?

338
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,900
What?

339
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,100
Julian promised me a little bit of action.

340
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,400
You still like it in the afternoon?

341
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,100
So what did you do? Rob a train?
Blow up a building?

342
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
Leave the girl alone.

343
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,800
You told me he was suave.
Wanker's a drunk.

344
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,500
He's suave. You should have seen him
in the old days when he was a real activist.

345
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,800
You were the activist,
I just wanted to get laid.

346
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,500
One time the police came
to throw us out of our squat

347
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,800
and Theo invited them up for coffee
to negotiate,

348
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,800
only the coffee was spiked with ketamine.

349
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,300
No! You didn't, did you?

350
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,900
Fuck off. You gotta be kidding.

351
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,400
You know how many people
I've tried this with?

352
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
I don't wanna know.

353
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,700
You'll be happy to know
out of the hundreds...

354
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,300
- Hundreds?
- ...you are still the only one.

355
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,500
- I'm not doing it.
- Yes, you are.

356
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,100
- No, I'm not. The car's moving too much.
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

357
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,500
You are. Ready?

358
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,300
Thelonius!

359
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,200
No, wait, wait. Okay.

360
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,600
Do it again! Do it again!

361
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Julian, that's disgusting!

362
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,900
Look out!

363
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,300
Jesus! Shit!

364
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,700
Go! Go! We're gonna make it.
Come on, we're gonna make it.

365
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,700
No, I'm not gonna make it!
I'm not gonna make it!

366
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,700
- Christ!
- Back up! Back up now!

367
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,600
Jesus!

368
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,700
Oh, save us!
Save us in our hour of need!

369
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,500
Blessed Mary, save us.

370
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,400
Christ, Jesus!

371
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,000
- He's got a gun!
- Cover Kee!

372
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,300
Get down!

373
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,500
Oh, my God!

374
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,700
She's been shot! Fuck. She's been shot.

375
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,200
- How is she? How is she?
- She's bleeding!

376
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,900
She's bleeding, she's bleeding everywhere!

377
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,800
Shit! Julian.

378
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Put pressure on the wound!

379
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,300
Please, please, please.

380
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
Please, please.

381
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Oh, no.

382
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,700
Oh, no.

383
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,300
Julian...

384
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,100
Jesus Christ!

385
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,100
Julian!

386
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,500
It's the cops. It's the cops.

387
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,900
Did they see us?

388
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,900
Keep going. Speed up.

389
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Are they coming back?
What's happening?

390
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,100
Faster! Faster!

391
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
- Are they coming back?
- I don't know. Just go faster!

392
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,100
Can't you pull off the road?

393
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,000
- All right, slow down. Slow down!
- I can't outrun them. I can't outrun them.

394
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,400
- Stop the car.
- I gotta stop. I gotta stop.

395
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,100
Pull over to the side of the road.
Stop the car!

396
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,000
Get your passports out!

397
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,700
Stay inside the vehicle!

398
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,000
We're British citizens!
We're British citizens!

399
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,400
- British citizens!
- Hands on the steering wheel!

400
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,200
Hands on the steering wheel!
Calm down. Tell me what happened!

401
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,100
We were attacked!
We gotta take her to a hospital.

402
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,900
Okay. Just wait.
I'm gonna call for assistance.

403
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,200
What are you doing? What are you doing?

404
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,600
- Get in the car.
- Why did you do that?

405
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,500
Get in the fucking car!

406
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Get back in now. Quickly.
We gotta get off the road. Get in. Get in.

407
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,500
Go! Go! Go!

408
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,100
We have to call on help now.
Put your hands out.

409
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Fucking shit.

410
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,800
May all the ascended beings,
the bodhisattvas and saints

411
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,000
and all those who have walked the surface
of the earth in the light of eternal truth,

412
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,800
come to the aid
of our beloved sister, Julian.

413
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,700
Theo! Come on!

414
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,300
Theo, come on!

415
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,900
This is Tomasz and Emily's farm.
I already called and told them the situation.

416
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,700
We'll be safe here.

417
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,500
Fishes are coming in
to vote for a new leader.

418
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
- Ian?
- Yeah.

419
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,100
- We have to convene.
- Everyone's arriving.

420
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,300
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, it's not my blood.

421
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,600
- Emily, Tomasz, this is Kee.
- Welcome.

422
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,900
Miriam.

423
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,800
They need to wash up and rest.

424
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,500
How about Julian's mate?

425
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,700
Yeah, can somebody
give me a lift back to London?

426
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,500
No, no, no. It's too dangerous.
We'll sort it tomorrow.

427
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Tomasz, get him a shower and a clean shirt.

428
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,000
Tomasz, don't block the car in.
It needs to be jump-started. Ian?

429
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,200
Yeah.

430
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,700
They like you. And they don't like anyone.

431
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,500
- You did what you could.
- We need to show strength and unity.

432
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,300
- The shirt fit?
- Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.

433
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
I'll take care of this.

434
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,100
As head Fishes,
we need to make a choice now.

435
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,400
We need to choose leadership.

436
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,300
I don't think
that those bloodstains will wash off.

437
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,100
Don't worry about it. Throw it away.

438
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,500
- I'm in charge of watching you.
- Why?

439
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,400
They told me.

440
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,500
Well, I'm going back to London tomorrow.

441
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,200
I lived there once. Didn't like it.

442
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,700
No.

443
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
They kill you.

444
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,600
- Where you from?
- Poland.

445
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,900
Is this your place?

446
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
My missus. She's a cod.

447
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,500
- English Fish.
- Mr. Faron.

448
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,500
Kee would like a word with you.
She's in the barn. It's all right, Tomasz.

449
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,300
I'll watch him.

450
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Hey, don't smoke in the barn.

451
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,600
To Luke, our new leader. Luke.

452
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,000
- To Luke.
- Luke.

453
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,300
I'll be right outside.

454
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,900
You know what they do to these cows?
They cut off their tits. They do.

455
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,700
Gone. Bye.

456
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Only leave four. Four tits fits the machine.

457
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,300
It's wacko. Why not make machines
that suck eight titties?

458
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,200
Is that what you want to talk about?
Cows and titties?

459
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,200
Julian told me about your baby.

460
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,100
Said his name was Dylan.

461
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,500
You taught him to swim when he was two.
He called you "Papa."

462
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,200
She said if anything goes spooky,
I should talk to you.

463
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,200
Said you'd help me,
said you'd get me to the boat.

464
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,000
- What boat?
- The Tomorrow.

465
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,200
The Tomorrow?

466
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

467
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
But I'm sure
your friends can take care of you.

468
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,400
But Julian said only trust you.

469
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
She said you'd help me.

470
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,500
I don't know why she said that.

471
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,700
Listen, I don't quite know what's going on.

472
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,200
- You can't leave.
- Kee, I'm in a lot of trouble myself.

473
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,500
- I'm sorry.
- Wait!

474
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,300
What are you doing? Don't do that.

475
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,300
I'm scared.

476
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,300
Please help me.

477
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,100
Jesus Christ.

478
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,600
- Kee! Kee!
- What are you doing?

479
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,900
- Are you all right?
- She wanted him to know. She has the right.

480
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,800
Of course she has.

481
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,400
For God's sake.

482
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,100
When you're ready, come inside.
Everybody's arrived.

483
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,300
- She's pregnant.
- Now you know what's at stake.

484
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,500
- But she's pregnant.
- Yeah, I know.

485
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,800
It's a miracle, isn't it?

486
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,600
Fishes terrorist leader Julian Taylor
was killed today

487
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,300
in a gun battle with police near Canterbury.

488
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,100
Four other terrorists escaped
after murdering two officers.

489
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,900
Police say they have sufficient
forensic and surveillance evidence

490
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,800
to identify the four killers.

491
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,700
All suspects should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

492
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,700
This was broadcast an hour ago.

493
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,500
We have to assume it's just a matter of time
before they identify the rest of us,

494
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
which includes you, Theo.

495
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,100
- Why is he here?
- He's not a Fish.

496
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
- He's not one of us.
- I want him here.

497
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,100
Kee wants him, he stays.

498
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,500
Now, we all agreed to deliver Kee to our
brothers and sisters in the Human Project.

499
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,700
- Right.
- Now we got to reevaluate that position.

500
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,900
No, there's no need.
We move forward with the original plan.

501
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yes!

502
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,200
She'll never make it.
The police are looking for her.

503
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,500
We can find a way. It's what Julian wanted.

504
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,000
We'd be risking the girl's life.

505
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,400
Listen, listen! She belongs here.

506
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
And this baby is the flag
that could unite us all!

507
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,900
We said we'd never use this baby
for political purposes.

508
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,100
My baby's not a flag.

509
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,700
Make it public!

510
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
What?

511
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
- What?
- What?

512
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Excuse me?

513
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,500
You should make it public.

514
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,700
You saw the telly.
She's about to be very public.

515
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,000
It doesn't matter. She's pregnant.

516
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,700
Oh, right. And then the government will say,
"We were wrong. Fugees are humans, too."

517
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,900
Well, whatever is going on,

518
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
whatever your political ideas are,
it's irrelevant.

519
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,400
- It doesn't matter.
- Come on.

520
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,300
- She needs a doctor.
- You really don't get it.

521
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,300
Look, the government
will take her baby

522
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,300
and parade a posh black English lady
as the mother.

523
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,300
- And she'll never see it again.
- Nobody's taking my baby!

524
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,300
We all know this government
would never acknowledge

525
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,300
the first human birth in 18 years
from a fugee.

526
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,500
A wanted fugee.

527
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,500
Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron
what they do to immigrants in this country?

528
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,500
He knows. He's seen the cages.
He's not that stupid.

529
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm not going to the government.

530
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,000
You told me
you would get me to the Human Project.

531
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,400
- You promised me.
- I know.

532
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,900
And we will.

533
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,200
But I don't think it's safe
to try and reach the coast now.

534
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,900
You could stay here, Kee.
It's a safe place for you to have your child.

535
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,800
And when you and the baby
are well enough,

536
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,100
we will find a way
to get you to the Human Project.

537
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,100
I promise you, Kee.

538
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,300
It could take months
to get back in touch with them again.

539
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,600
This is true.
We have to take it under consideration.

540
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,800
Kee, this is your decision.

541
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,600
What do you think?

542
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,100
- I think you need proper care.
- Oh, brilliant!

543
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,600
She has proper care!

544
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,100
- What the fuck does he know?
- Hang on. Kee?

545
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,800
Kee, this is your choice.

546
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,400
- I have my baby here...
- Yes!

547
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,900
...then you get me to the Human Project.

548
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,900
Thank you, Kee. Thank you.

549
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,200
We need to organize safe houses.
No more than three days in one place.

550
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,600
No, no,
you can't keep moving her around.

551
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,800
It's for her safety.

552
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,100
- Please help him!
- What are you doing?

553
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,900
- He's hurt really badly!
- Oh, shit, fuck.

554
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,200
- I didn't have anywhere else to go.
- You're not supposed to be here!

555
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
There's fucking police everywhere!

556
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,700
- What do you think you're doing?
- He's been bleeding for hours!

557
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,000
Shut up! Get his bike out of here.
Get it out!

558
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,200
What was I supposed to do?

559
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,300
It's a simple fucking plan.
Get in here, Patric!

560
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,800
What the fuck are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here?

561
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,900
No fucking excuses!

562
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,500
- You have a first aid kit? Medicine?
- Mostly for cows.

563
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,500
Iodine, bandages, clean towels,
whatever you have, bring it to the barn.

564
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,200
And for God's sake,
hide the fucking motorcycle.

565
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,600
- You put everything at risk.
- What was I supposed to do?

566
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,900
What about all the fucking police, Ian?
You said it would be safe!

567
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,300
We paid the gang.
We had no idea about the cops.

568
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
You broke the protocol.
What were you thinking?

569
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,900
What was I thinking?

570
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,200
You could be responsible
for putting the Uprising in jeopardy.

571
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,500
He needs a proper doctor!

572
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,000
Don't you get it?

573
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,200
We have a baby.

574
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,500
When people see we have a baby,
everyone will join us in the Uprising.

575
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,700
But we can forget about the baby
if the girl even suspects we killed Julian!

576
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,100
What was I supposed to do?

577
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,900
You saw how he is.
He's on death's fucking door!

578
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,100
- Take it easy.
- You broke protocol.

579
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,800
He's my fucking cousin!

580
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,300
Luke, he needs a doctor.

581
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,500
Don't worry. We'll take care of him.
Simon, right?

582
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,900
- Aye, Simon.
- All right, sit down, Patric.

583
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,100
Simon is a good Fish. So are you.

584
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,600
Be proud to know that because
of the two of you, the Uprising is assured.

585
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,700
The baby will stay with us.

586
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,900
Where's Faron? He's a fucking dead man.

587
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,600
No. Tomorrow. We'll do him then,
after we move the girl.

588
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,100
Patric, you ever break protocol again,

589
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,100
I'll have to kill you.

590
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,000
Kee. Kee, it's Theo.

591
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,700
- Listen to me.
- What's going on?

592
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,700
Luke killed Julian.
They want your baby. They killed Julian.

593
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,500
They're gonna...
They killed Julian. They're gonna kill me.

594
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,200
We have to leave. We have to go now.

595
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,900
Miriam, shut up!

596
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,900
Trust me, we've got to go.

597
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,400
Stop it! Stop it! Both of you!

598
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,100
Get off!

599
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,600
I'm going with him.
Miriam, you can stay if you want.

600
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,200
Miriam, you have to keep your mouth shut.

601
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
- I mean it.
- All right. All right.

602
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,700
We're moving the girl
to Bristol straight away.

603
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,300
We need to bring weapons over...

604
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,900
The refugee camps...

605
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,500
Zaphyr, he looks
bloody fucking awful.

606
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,700
Yeah. Really?

607
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
All that dirt and sand in there,
nowhere to hide the blood in, no skin.

608
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,300
Shit! It's fucking disgusting.

609
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,500
He's not gonna make it.

610
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,100
Of course not gonna make it,
with all the blood and guts coming out.

611
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,300
Hey, Samir.

612
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,100
Shit.

613
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,800
Stop! Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!

614
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,600
Don't shoot!

615
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,600
Don't shoot! The girl's in the car!

616
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,500
- Stop!
- The girl's in the car!

617
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,200
Stop the fucking car!
Give me the fucking keys.

618
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,000
Give me the fucking keys.

619
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,400
Get down! Get down!

620
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,000
Can't you get it moving any faster?
For God's sake!

621
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,500
Come on. Come on.

622
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,300
Stop!

623
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,900
Stop!

624
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,200
Shit.

625
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
They're coming! They're coming!

626
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,500
Get going, get going!
They're getting closer!

627
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,100
Oh, God! He's gaining on us!

628
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,900
Can I shoot? I got a clean shot!

629
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,700
Fuck off!

630
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,700
Miriam, jump-start the car!

631
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,100
We have to go!

632
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,200
Wait till it gets faster!

633
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,700
All right! All right! Just push, you push!

634
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,500
Fucking hell!

635
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,000
Miriam! Miriam!

636
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,400
We have to wait for him! Theo!

637
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,800
Go, go, go!

638
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,200
- Kee, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

639
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
We need to find a safe house.

640
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,300
Yeah, the last one was
really fucking safe.

641
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,600
Well, what do you suggest?

642
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,000
Don't worry. I know where to go.

643
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,700
Wait here.

644
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,900
Oh, fuck.

645
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,900
Fuck.

646
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,800
Jasper?

647
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,900
Janice?

648
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,700
Jasper?

649
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,000
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, fuck you.

650
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,900
What are you doing with this shit?

651
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
This? I mix it with bread to poison the rats.

652
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,300
It's not bullshit what they say.
They pass away quite peacefully.

653
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,800
Jasper.

654
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,500
Meet Miriam and Kee.

655
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,700
The Tomorrow is a hospital ship
disguised as a fishing boat.

656
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,300
They'll take us to the Human Project.

657
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,400
I told you, amigo, the Human Project is real.

658
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,800
Yeah, but you're also the guy
that believes in UFOs.

659
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,500
Tell them about that thing
you saw on the heath.

660
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,800
You saw a UFO?

661
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,800
Did you know that the Human Project

662
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,900
is supposed to have
a community on the Azores?

663
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,700
It's a sanctuary.
That's where they'll take us, Kee.

664
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,500
Can you catch this ship anywhere else?

665
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,400
It's going to stop at the last two
weather buoys en route at sunset.

666
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,300
So it will be tonight at Windsmore
and then two night's time at Bexhill.

667
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
You can forget about Windsmore.
We'd never make it in time.

668
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,300
No, it's our only chance.
We can't get to Bexhill.

669
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,700
That's a refugee camp.

670
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,600
Eureka! Eat and rest.

671
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,100
With a little bit of luck,
you're going to need all your energy.

672
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,900
- Where are you going?
- Feed her for me, Theo.

673
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,700
Kee, your baby is the miracle

674
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,000
the whole world has been waiting for.

675
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,000
Come on. Come on.

676
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,300
Did he really see a UFO?

677
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,800
Is she doing her voodoo hoodoo?

678
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,500
She's doing something.

679
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,000
She smited me with that.
Said it was good for my baby.

680
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,300
Does she look posh to you, or gawky?

681
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,000
Earnest.

682
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,500
Yeah.

683
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,000
- How many months?
- Eight.

684
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,900
It takes nine months.

685
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,200
I know.

686
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,600
Who's the father?

687
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,100
Whiffet. I'm a virgin.

688
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,700
Sorry?

689
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,500
That'd be wicked, eh?

690
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,900
Yeah, it would.

691
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,400
Fuck knows.
I don't know most of the wankers' names.

692
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,500
You know, when I started puking,
I thought I catch the pest.

693
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,900
But then my belly started getting big.

694
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,500
Nobody ever told me these things.
I never seen a pregnant woman before.

695
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,000
But I knew.

696
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,600
I felt like a freak.

697
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,700
I didn't tell nobody.

698
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,100
I thought about the Quietus thing.
Supposed to be suave.

699
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,200
Pretty music and all that.

700
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,700
Then the baby kicked.

701
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,600
I feel it. Little bastard was alive.
And I feel it. And me, too.

702
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,500
I am alive.

703
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,100
- Froley.
- Froley.

704
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,400
Name my baby Froley.

705
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,900
It's the first baby in 18 years.

706
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,600
- You can't call it Froley.
- Says who?

707
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,900
Kee, I've found you a boat.

708
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
- Great.
- How?

709
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,100
We get ourselves arrested.

710
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,500
- Oh, Jesus.
- No, no.

711
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,400
Syd, this border guard I sell pot to,
has agreed to get us into Bexhill.

712
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,500
Nicely ironic, eh? We break into prison!

713
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,500
Wicked.

714
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,100
"Froley."

715
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,300
Come on.

716
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,800
Everything is a mythical
cosmic battle

717
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,200
between faith and chance.

718
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,300
- Maybe I shouldn't.
- You already did. Take another one.

719
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,800
Now cough.

720
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,700
- What do you taste?
- Strawberries.

721
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,900
Strawberries? That's what it's called.
Strawberry Cough.

722
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Wicked.

723
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:45,100
So, you've got faith over here, right,
and chance over there.

724
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,100
- Like yin and yang.
- Sort of.

725
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,900
Or Shiva and Shakti.

726
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,500
Lennon and McCartney.

727
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,700
Look, Julian and Theo.

728
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah, there you go. Julian and Theo met
among a million protestors in a rally

729
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,200
by chance.

730
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,900
But they were there
because of what they believed in

731
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,400
in the first place, their faith.
They wanted to change the world.

732
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,100
And their faith kept them together.

733
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,600
But by chance, Dylan was born.

734
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,200
This is him?

735
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,900
Yeah, that's him. He would have been
about your age. Magical child.

736
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,100
Beautiful.

737
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,300
- Their faith put in praxis.
- Praxis?

738
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,500
- What happened?
- Chance.

739
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,700
He was their sweet little dream.

740
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
He had little hands, little legs, little feet.

741
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,100
Little lungs.

742
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,000
And in 2008, along came the flu pandemic.

743
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,800
And then, by chance,

744
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,700
- he was gone.
- Oh, Jesus.

745
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,000
You see, Theo's faith

746
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,700
lost out to chance.

747
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,100
So,

748
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,200
why bother
if life's going to make its own choices?

749
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,300
- Watcha! Baby's got Theo's eyes.
- Yeah.

750
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,700
Oh, boy. That's terrible.

751
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,200
But, you know,
everything happens for a reason.

752
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,700
That I don't know.

753
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,000
But Theo and Julian would always
bring Dylan. He loved it here.

754
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,000
It's the alarm!
Someone's breaking in!

755
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,600
What is it?

756
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,100
Look at this.

757
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,500
Shit.

758
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,000
Jasper, hurry up!

759
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,700
Where's Janice?

760
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,000
Take the back path to the main road,
then follow the map I've given Miriam.

761
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,200
- Yeah, I've got it.
- What are you talking about?

762
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,400
Wait for Syd at the old school
on Watchbell Road in Rye.

763
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,700
Give him this, and tell him he's a fascist pig.

764
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,300
- We need to get Janice.
- We're not going, Theo.

765
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,600
- What are you talking about?
- You don't need an anchor.

766
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,200
- No, Jasper. You're coming.
- You need time. We'll stall them.

767
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,000
I'll send them the wrong way.
It's the best idea. Go on. Go on.

768
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,200
Jasper.

769
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,600
Theo, I've talked my way out of
worse things than this. Believe me.

770
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,300
Go on. Go.

771
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,100
And remember, tell Syd he's a fascist pig.

772
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,600
I love you.

773
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,700
Hey, amigos!

774
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,600
We're looking for Theo Faron.

775
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,100
We know he was here a few weeks ago.
Has he been back?

776
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,700
- Who?
- Theo Faron.

777
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,500
I haven't seen him in weeks.

778
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,200
There's biscuits and coffee on inside!
Help yourself.

779
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,900
You want a drag?
Come on, have a drag. Lighten up.

780
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,700
- What we got?
- Here, Luke.

781
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,000
There's a dead woman and dog inside.

782
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,700
They're going to Bexhill.

783
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,100
When did they leave?

784
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,300
When did they leave?

785
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,400
Pull my finger, go on.

786
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,300
Pull my finger.

787
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,500
I'll do it.

788
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,400
Fuck you.

789
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
Pull my finger.

790
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,600
- Theo, I'm so sorry.
- Don't you fucking touch me.

791
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,800
You tell me the fucking reason in that.

792
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,200
- It's all part of a bigger thing.
- Shut up!

793
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,500
Shut up and get in the fucking car.

794
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,000
- Jasper?
- He's fine.

795
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,400
Everything's fine.

796
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,200
I was 31.
Midwife at the John Radcliffe.

797
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,900
I was doing a stint in the antenatal clinic.

798
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,900
Three of my patients
miscarried in one week.

799
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,300
Others were in their fifth and sixth month.
We managed to save two of the poor babies.

800
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,700
Next week, five more miscarried.

801
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,900
Then the miscarriages
started happening earlier.

802
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,700
I remember booking a woman in
for her next appointment

803
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,300
and noticing that the page
seven months ahead was completely blank.

804
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,700
Not a single name.

805
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,400
I rang a friend
who was working at Queen Charlotte's,

806
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,900
and she had no new pregnancies, either.

807
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,100
She then rang her sister in Sydney.

808
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,100
And it was the same thing there.

809
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
You can relax. She's finished.

810
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,800
As the sound of the playgrounds faded,

811
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,500
the despair set in.

812
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,900
Very odd what happens in a world
without children's voices.

813
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,000
I was there at the end.

814
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,100
Now you're gonna be there at the beginning.

815
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,900
Yeah.

816
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,400
I'll be there at the beginning.

817
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,900
Thank you.

818
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,500
Kee, come on! We've got to go!

819
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,300
Stop where you are.

820
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,600
I'm looking for Syd.

821
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,100
Hands above your head.

822
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,500
You're a fascist pig.

823
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,900
What did you say?

824
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,500
I was told to tell you you're a fascist pig.

825
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,900
- Say it again.
- No, don't, please!

826
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,900
Say it again.

827
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,000
Say it!

828
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,800
You're a fascist pig.

829
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,400
Come on.

830
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,900
It was Jasper's idea, you know.
The whole password thing.

831
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,700
He will piss himself laughing
when I tell him about this.

832
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
He's a cheeky old bastard.

833
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,800
So proud of his weed.

834
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,700
Syd could get it a lot cheaper from
the gangs, but Syd likes to deal with Jasper.

835
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,900
Jasper's straight. A true gentleman.

836
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,500
- All right.
- What's wrong with her? Is she sick?

837
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,100
Just carsick.

838
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,400
- She's not going to puke, is she?
- No. She's fine.

839
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,300
Puking's bad. Very, very bad.

840
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,500
It doesn't wash out.
The smell never goes away.

841
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:33,500
Usually, there's people trying
to get out of Bexhill, not in.

842
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,500
Syd doesn't know why you want to get in.

843
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,000
Syd doesn't want to know.

844
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,900
Syd doesn't care.

845
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,100
Just breathe. Just breathe.

846
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,400
What's wrong with her?

847
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,100
A minor contraction.
It's normal. Just breathe.

848
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
All right.

849
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,500
When you're released,
stroll out with the other fugees.

850
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,100
Look for the statue of a soldier.

851
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,500
There you'll meet a woman, Marichka.
Arab, gypsy, something.

852
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,700
Always carries a shitty little dog with her.

853
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,100
She'll find you accommodation for tonight.

854
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,500
All right. You're fugees now.

855
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,400
Show Syd the fugee face.

856
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,200
Sad face.

857
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,900
Sad fugee face.

858
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,700
That's good. That's good.

859
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,100
Okay. Out!

860
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,300
Come on. Come on. Come on.

861
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,600
Hurry up. Hurry up, move.

862
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,800
Send me a postcard.

863
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Seats in the back!
Come on, hurry up!

864
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,100
What time
are we supposed to meet the boat?

865
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,600
Sunset tomorrow.

866
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,800
How do we know that Luke and his mob
haven't intercepted it?

867
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,400
Luke has no way of contacting
the Human Project. Nor does anyone else.

868
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,600
Say again?

869
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,800
Contact with the Human Project
is done by mirrors.

870
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,800
Julian was our mirror.

871
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,100
What do you mean, "mirrors"?

872
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,100
Mirrors. They contact one of our people.

873
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,500
That person contacts someone else,
and so on, till word gets to Julian.

874
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,700
She tells Luke.

875
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,100
You mean you never
actually talked to any of them?

876
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,600
Don't fucking tell me
you never actually talked to them?

877
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,100
- Breathe it out.
- Is she okay?

878
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
That's it. Breathe it out, breathe it out.

879
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,300
I can't fucking breathe.

880
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,500
You sure this is normal?

881
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,900
It shouldn't be this frequent.

882
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,700
Come on, breathe it out. All right, all right.

883
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,100
Miriam,

884
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,900
I'm all wet.

885
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,500
Her water's broke. The baby's coming.

886
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,400
Shit. Shit!

887
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,700
All right, sweetheart. All right, sweetheart.
Everything is fine. Breathe.

888
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,500
Just breathe it out. That's it.

889
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,900
Tomorrow you'll be safe.
You'll be on the boat.

890
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,300
On the Tomorrow, they'll take care of you.

891
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,700
They'll take you far away from all this.

892
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,400
Look up, you piece of shite. Look up.

893
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,800
Out!

894
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,400
Get out!

895
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,300
Lord, give Kee the strength to know
that she has the power already within her.

896
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,900
- She has the wisdom...
- What's wrong with you?

897
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,800
I said, what's wrong with you?

898
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,600
Look at me!
I said, what's wrong with you?

899
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,700
- Saint Gabriel, help us...
- Shut up!

900
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,600
- You! Out!
- Saint Gabriel, come to our aid!

901
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,400
Listen, you fucking nutcase! Get out!

902
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,700
- Up, now. Come on.
- Caca! Caca!

903
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,100
Piss. Piss. Caca. Smell. Girl.

904
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,800
You smell it yourself.
You fucking people disgust me.

905
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,200
She's okay, Kee. She's okay.

906
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,900
- She's gonna be...
- Miriam!

907
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,700
Move it! Come along now!

908
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,700
Come on, shift it! Shift it! You!

909
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,600
Get down there. Down there. Move.

910
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,100
Follow the line!

911
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,900
- Theo!
- Kee!

912
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,900
- Take it off!
- Theo!

913
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,100
Come on, move! Move it! Come on!

914
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,100
Move it! Move it!

915
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,300
Come on! Move! Move!

916
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,400
Britain supports you
and provides you shelter.

917
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,500
Do not support terrorists.

918
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,600
Britain supports you
and provides you shelter.

919
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,900
Do not support terrorists.

920
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,800
Hey you, buddy!
Buddy, buddy, welcome to paradise!

921
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,100
You want accommodations?
I got running water! I got...

922
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,500
Just leave the girl alone.

923
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,100
- Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?
- Fuck off.

924
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,700
- Who do you fucking think you are?
- Fuck off.

925
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,700
Don't mind these bastards.
I'll take care of you.

926
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,100
Come on, I've got a room, food,
a place to stay. What do you need?

927
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,500
- I'm fine, thanks.
- You must need something, man.

928
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,300
"Fuck off," is it? Bollocks.

929
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,800
Marichka?

930
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,500
It's okay, Kee.

931
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,500
Just breathe through it.

932
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,900
That's it. It's okay. We're almost there, Kee.

933
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,400
We're almost there.

934
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,900
It's just a few stairs.

935
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,800
Just hold onto me.

936
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,700
I've got you.

937
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,100
Just keep breathing.

938
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,100
Marichka? How far?

939
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,900
How far?

940
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,900
We're almost there, Kee. Almost there.

941
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,000
You're doing great. Come on.

942
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,100
You're almost there. Three more steps.

943
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,500
We're there, Kee. We're there.

944
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,700
Okay, there's a bed. Easy.

945
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,400
Make her go! Make her go!

946
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,500
That's great. Thank you.

947
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,500
Get her out!

948
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,300
Get her out!

949
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,100
Thank you.

950
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,500
Okay, Kee.

951
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,900
I'm going to put my coat underneath.
You'll be cleaner.

952
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,300
You're okay.

953
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,300
Okay?

954
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,900
There's water.
I'm just going to wash my hands.

955
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,500
- Theo! Theo!
- I'm here. Fuck!

956
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,300
It's okay. Everything's okay.

957
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,000
Do something!

958
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,200
It's looking good, Kee. It's looking good.

959
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,400
You're doing great. Just keep breathing.

960
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,600
- Keep breathing.
- I am breathing!

961
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,900
No, like Miriam said. Do you remember?
Breathe out. Just think about the out.

962
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,500
Breathe out and push. Push as well.

963
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,600
- That's it. That's it!
- I can't!

964
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,600
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
Just out and push.

965
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,500
Out and push.

966
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,100
- That's it!
- I can't do it, Theo. Stop it, please.

967
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,600
Kee, I can see the head. I can see the head.

968
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,300
You're doing great. You're doing great, Kee.

969
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,500
That's it. That's it.

970
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:05,100
It's coming again.
Just breathe out and push. Out and push.

971
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,000
- That's it. Out and...
- I can't.

972
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,100
- You can. Yes, you can.
- I fucking can't!

973
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,200
- Yes, you fucking can! Come on!
- I can't do it.

974
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,000
Kee, the head's coming out.

975
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,500
That's it, you're nearly there!
You're nearly there. Just push!

976
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,900
Push, Kee! Push!

977
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,300
Push!

978
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,900
Oh, my God.

979
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,100
How is he?

980
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,700
It's a girl.

981
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,700
Kee, you've got a girl.

982
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,300
Hey, baba.

983
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,300
- Aren't we supposed to cut the cord?
- Yeah, it's okay. There's no rush.

984
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,300
You've done it.

985
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,300
Kee,

986
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,700
see?

987
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,100
It wasn't that bad.

988
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Oh, yeah, not for you.

989
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,300
Come on! Hurry up!
We don't have much time!

990
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,500
Who is it?

991
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,000
The King of England.
Open the door, you asshole. It's Syd.

992
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,900
How can you sleep through
when the whole city's going to hell?

993
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,900
- What's wrong with her?
- She's fine. It's a woman's thing.

994
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Fuck off!

995
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,700
A few hours ago, a bomb blew a hole
in the fence and fugees got out.

996
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,000
But Syd happens to know,

997
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,400
the hole in the fence
isn't about fugees getting out.

998
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,200
- It's about Fishies getting in.
- Go away.

999
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:05,700
Syd also happens to know that the Army's
gonna blow the shit out of this place.

1000
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,200
But don't worry. Syd is here to get you out.

1001
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,100
Fuck off. Go away. Go on. Piss off!

1002
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,800
Get your fucking dog.

1003
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,600
What you got there?

1004
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,400
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1005
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,800
- Nothing.
- No?

1006
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,500
- Like to show me?
- I don't have anything.

1007
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,500
- It's nothing.
- Well, if it's nothing, then I can have a look.

1008
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,100
- It's nothing.
- Let me see.

1009
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,700
- No.
- Let me see.

1010
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,600
It's okay. Let me see.

1011
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:42,600
Jesus Christ.

1012
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,100
Jesus Christ.

1013
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,700
- That's a...
- That's right.

1014
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,100
We got a baby.

1015
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:54,100
And now we need a rowboat.
Can you help us?

1016
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,300
Get her up. Get her up. We need to go.

1017
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,500
Can you help us get a boat?

1018
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just get her up.
We need to go. We need to go now.

1019
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,900
- What's she saying?
- Fuck knows.

1020
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,100
Bad! Bad! Bad!

1021
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,300
- She doesn't want us to go.
- Shut up.

1022
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,400
We need to go.

1023
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,900
Syd was watching television last night
with Mommy.

1024
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,100
She's a sweet old soul.
Dying of cancer. It's heartbreaking.

1025
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,800
And then the news came on,
and you two were on it.

1026
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,100
Something about a cop killer.

1027
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,700
Something about a big reward.

1028
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,500
Syd then finds out
the Fishes are looking for you.

1029
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,200
So Syd thinks,
"If the Fishes are looking for you,

1030
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:39,700
"and the coppers are looking for you,

1031
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,400
"you people are first class commodities."

1032
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,000
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

1033
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,500
Down, down, down!

1034
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,200
Now, Syd has a baby.

1035
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Bad! Bad! Bad!

1036
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,700
Marichka!

1037
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,800
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!
I'll fucking kill you!

1038
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,400
Bitch. You bitch.

1039
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,300
Baby! Marichka baby!

1040
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,500
Quick, quick. The baby!

1041
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,200
My baby! She took...

1042
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,600
I'll fucking kill you, you gypsy bitch!

1043
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,800
I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.

1044
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,100
Go, go!

1045
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Fuck! Shit.

1046
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,100
How are you doing?

1047
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,100
- How are you?
- It hurts.

1048
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:17,700
Marichka, we need a boat.

1049
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,000
A boat. The sea, a boat, a rowboat.

1050
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,000
We need a boat.

1051
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,600
A fucking boat! A boat.

1052
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,900
- A rowboat!
- Yes.

1053
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,600
Hurry.

1054
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,200
- You okay? Come on.
- Hurry.

1055
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,600
Hurry. Hurry.

1056
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,300
It's okay.

1057
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,700
Look at that, Theo. They love my baby.

1058
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,800
I want to call her Bazouka.

1059
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,100
Bazouka?

1060
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,100
You don't like it?

1061
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,200
I was getting used to Froley.

1062
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,800
Froley's a man's name.

1063
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,900
What is he thinking, giving you
a boy's name? You're a girl.

1064
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,800
We have a boat. Stay here.
In one hour, we go.

1065
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,400
Thanks.

1066
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,400
Human Project real?

1067
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,000
It better be.

1068
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,500
Drop your gun! Drop your gun!

1069
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,000
Put your hands up!
Put your fucking hands in the air!

1070
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,300
Okay, is clear! Is clear!

1071
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,300
Hands above your head
and fucking move that here.

1072
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,500
You killed my fucking cousin!

1073
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,400
Get on your knees!
On your knees, you fucking...

1074
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,100
He was 19!

1075
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,200
Don't kill him!

1076
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,300
Don't kill him!

1077
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,900
Watch the flanks!

1078
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,300
Kee. Thank God.

1079
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,700
You'll be safe now. How's the child?

1080
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,500
You put their lives at risk.

1081
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,200
Just let her go.
You don't know what you're doing.

1082
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,600
No? Look around you.

1083
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,300
It's the Uprising.

1084
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,100
And they haven't even seen the baby.
Let's go.

1085
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,900
No! Get off...

1086
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,900
Not in front of the girl.

1087
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,700
Wait till we get around the corner.
Then do them all.

1088
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,800
Come on!

1089
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,800
Oh, lads

1090
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,700
You should have seen us gannin'

1091
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,600
Passing the folks along the road
And all of them was starin'

1092
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,500
And all the lads and lasses there
They all had smilin' faces

1093
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,600
Fuck!

1094
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,700
Sorry. Sorry.

1095
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,300
Move it! Get her inside!

1096
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,100
Faron!

1097
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,200
Get her inside!
Get her in the building now!

1098
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,500
Now! Move it! Now!

1099
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,700
Sarge, left flank!

1100
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,300
Slug the fuckers!

1101
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,700
Don't shoot! Citizens! We citizens!

1102
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,100
Go check the roof!

1103
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,000
I was carrying the baby up the stairs.

1104
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,700
I started crying.

1105
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:38,400
I'd forgotten what they looked like.
They're so beautiful.

1106
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,500
They're so tiny.

1107
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,700
Julian was wrong!

1108
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,100
She thought it could be peaceful!

1109
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,800
But how can it be peaceful
when they try to take away your dignity?

1110
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,200
We need him, Theo!

1111
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,100
We need the baby. We need him!

1112
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,700
It's a girl, Luke.

1113
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,900
A girl?

1114
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,900
I had a sister.

1115
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,800
Theo! Theo!

1116
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,300
You okay?

1117
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,500
How is she?

1118
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,500
Annoyed.

1119
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,100
My God, the baby.

1120
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,800
Move back! Fucking move back!

1121
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,200
Stop! Cease fire! Cease firing!

1122
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,100
- Cease firing!
- Cease firing!

1123
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,500
- Cease firing!
- Cease firing!

1124
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:19,400
We've got two coming through,
coming out.

1125
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,200
Second floor, left!

1126
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,600
Medic!

1127
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,700
Marichka!

1128
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:19,100
No, Marichka no go. You go.

1129
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,100
- You go.
- Marichka, come. Marichka.

1130
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,100
- Marichka, get in the boat!
- Go, boat!

1131
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,000
The buoy! Theo, the buoy!

1132
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:43,600
You okay?

1133
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,400
Yeah. You?

1134
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,900
Yeah.

1135
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,700
What a day.

1136
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,700
We're too late, aren't we?

1137
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,700
No. No, we're fine.

1138
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,300
But they said they wouldn't wait.

1139
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,800
Trust me. They'll come back.

1140
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,900
I'm bleeding. Jesus, shit, I'm bleeding!

1141
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,200
- No, no, no, it's me.
- I'm bleeding everywhere.

1142
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,500
- It's me.
- What?

1143
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,200
He got me.

1144
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,500
Bad?

1145
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,000
No. I'm fine.

1146
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,000
Keep her close, Kee.

1147
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,500
Whatever happens, whatever they say,

1148
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,300
you keep her close.

1149
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,600
It's going to be okay.

1150
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,400
She's probably got wind. Wind her.

1151
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:58,400
Put her on your shoulder.

1152
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,600
Just... Just tap her back.

1153
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,300
Gently.

1154
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:17,800
Gently.

1155
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,900
There you go.

1156
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,700
Oh, Jesus.

1157
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,000
Dylan.

1158
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,700
I'll call my baby Dylan.
It's a girl's name, too.

1159
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:11,400
Theo?

1160
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,000
Theo?

1161
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,300
Theo!

1162
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,700
Theo, the boat.

1163
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:43,600
The boat!

1164
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,100
It's okay.

1165
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,300
We are safe now.

1166
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,600
We're safe.
