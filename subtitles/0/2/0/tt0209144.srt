1
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,450
<i>So where are you?
You're in some motel room.

2
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,662
<i>You just wake up,
and you're in a motel room.

3
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,082
<i>There's the key. It feels like maybe
it'sjust the first time you've been there...

4
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,753
<i>but... perhaps you've been there for a week...

5
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,380
<i>three months.

6
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,675
<i>It's kind of hard to say.
I don't know.

7
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,219
<i>It's just an anonymous room.

8
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,389
This guy.

9
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,723
He's here already.

10
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,810
Lenny!

11
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,271
It's Leonard...

12
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,023
like I told you before.

13
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,109
Did you? I must have forgot.

14
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,988
I guess I've already
told you about my condition.

15
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,156
Only every time I see you.

16
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,793
- My car.
- This is your car.

17
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,920
You're in a playful mood.

18
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,299
It's not good to make fun
of someone's handicap.

19
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,135
Just trying to have a little fun.

20
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,602
Roll up your window.

21
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,651
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed foryou.

22
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,698
- So where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.

23
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,700
What the hell you wanna go there for?

24
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,161
- You know it?
- Yeah. It'sjust this fucked-up building.

25
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,539
- Why do you wanna go there?
- Don't remember.

26
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,396
- Looks like somebody's home.
- That thing's been here for years.

27
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,694
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

28
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,447
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

29
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,492
Come on!

30
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,335
Let's take a look inside.

31
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,479
"Teddy."

32
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:18,484
"Don't believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him."

33
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,321
I finally found him.
How long have I been looking?

34
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,366
Find anything?

35
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,577
Didn't think so.

36
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,037
Let's go.

37
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,956
Fuck this.

38
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,918
You're gonna pay for what you did.

39
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,046
- Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.
- Leonard.

40
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,177
You don't have a clue, you freak.

41
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,557
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.

42
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,601
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

43
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,146
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

44
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,398
That's 'cause you read it
off a fucking picture.

45
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,776
You don't know who you are.

46
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,487
I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.

47
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:07,408
That's who you were.
That's not what you've become.

48
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,994
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny?

49
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,370
Come on.

50
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
Come on. Let's go down to the basement.

51
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,333
Let's go down, you and me, together.

52
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,419
Then you'll know who you really are.

53
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:23,924
No!

54
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,471
<i>It'sjust an anonymous room.

55
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,556
<i>There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.

56
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,561
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bible,
which I, ofcourse, read religiously.

57
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:42,151
<i>You know who you are,
and you know kind ofall about yourself.

58
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,822
<i>Butjust for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.

59
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,618
<i>Sammy Jankis had the same problem...

60
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,661
<i>but he really had no system.

61
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,122
<i>He wrote himself
a ridiculous amount of notes...

62
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,124
<i>but he'd get them all mixed up.

63
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,462
<i>You really do need a system
if you're gonna make it work.

64
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,269
- Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,605
- I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?

66
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,566
Burt.

67
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,986
Burt. I'm not sure. I think I may have
asked you to hold my calls.

68
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,905
- You don't know?
- I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

69
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,658
Right. You said you like to look people
in the eye when you talk to them.

70
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,160
Yeah.

71
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,870
You don't remember saying that?

72
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,206
- That's the thing. I have this condition.
- A condition?

73
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,667
- It's my memory.
- Amnesia?

74
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,545
No, no. It's different from that.
I have no short-term memory.

75
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,590
I know who I am. I know all about myself.

76
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,136
Since my injury, I can't make new memories.
Everything fades.

77
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,430
If we talk for too long,
I'll forget how we started.

78
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,224
Next time I see you,
I'm not gonna remember this conversation.

79
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,894
I don't even know if I've met you before.

80
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,064
So, if I seem a little strange
or rude or something...

81
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,110
I've told you this before, haven't I?

82
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:52,281
Yeah. I don't mean to mess with you,
but it's so weird.

83
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,575
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

84
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,494
- We've talked a bunch oftimes.
- I'm sure we have.

85
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,623
What's the last thing you remember?

86
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,208
My wife.

87
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,085
What's it like?

88
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,260
It's like waking.
It's like you just woke up.

89
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,555
That must suck.

90
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,265
It's all backwards.

91
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,604
Maybe you get an idea what you want to do next,
but you don't remember what you just did.

92
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,525
- I'm exactly the opposite...
- How long have I been staying here?

93
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,653
- Couple of days.
- And you're holding my calls?

94
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,448
- Like you said.
- Okay, but this guy's an exception.

95
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,410
- You know this guy?
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?

96
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,579
What makes you think he's my friend?

97
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,624
- I just saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

98
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,543
- Okay.
- If he calls or if he shows up here...

99
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,420
give me a call in my room, okay?

100
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,089
His name's Teddy?

101
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,132
- Teddy, yeah.
- All right.

102
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,387
Look, I hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

103
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,722
No, not as long as
you remember to pay the bill.

104
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,933
Yeah. Okay.

105
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,810
- Forty.
- Forty.

106
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,063
This guy...

107
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,858
He's here already.

108
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,987
Lenny!

109
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,241
<i>You really need a system
if you're gonna make it work.

110
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,369
<i>You kind of learn
to trust your own handwriting.

111
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,498
<i>That becomes an important part of your life.
You write yourself notes.

112
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,917
<i>Where you put your notes...
That also becomes important.

113
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,586
<i>You need a jacket that's got
like six pockets in it.

114
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,880
<i>Particular pockets for particular things.

115
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,801
<i>You just kind of learn to know
where things go and how the system works.

116
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,930
<i>And you have to be wary of other people writing
stuff for you that is not gonna make sense...

117
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,974
<i>or is gonna lead you astray.

118
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,352
<i>I don't know. I guess people try and take
advantage ofsomebody with this condition.

119
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:51,525
<i>If you have a piece
of information which is vital...

120
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer.

121
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,406
<i>It's just a permanent way of keeping a note.

122
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,373
Who is this?

123
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,050
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

124
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,998
Excuse me, sir.
You left these at your table.

125
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,792
Thanks.

126
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,628
- Lincoln Street?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,838
Go straight out on Sixth Street.
Go east all the way...

128
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,132
- Hold on. I'm gonna write this down.
- It's easy. Just go...

129
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,176
Trust me. I need to write this down.

130
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,185
"The Discount Inn."

131
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,961
Discount Inn.

132
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,797
Natalie.

133
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,175
My car.

134
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,971
Teddy.

135
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,819
"John Edward Gammell."

136
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,490
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

137
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,371
"Don't believe his lies."

138
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,805
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Mr. Gammell?

139
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,765
<i>- Lenny, is that you?</i>
- John Gammell?

140
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,268
<i>Lenny, it's Teddy. Stay there.
I'll be right over.

141
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,270
Okay. I'll be waiting.

142
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,665
"White. Male."

143
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,252

It's him.

149
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,618
I found you, you fuck.

150
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,016
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.

151
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,603
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.
I remember everything up until my injury.

152
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,397
I just can't make new memories.
So I can't remember talking to you.

153
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,442
What did we talk about?
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

154
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,861
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

155
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,697
Sammy's story helps me
understand my own situation.

156
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:35,911
Sammy wrote himself endless
amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

157
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,373
I have a more graceful
solution to the memory problem.

158
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm disciplined and organized.

159
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,798
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

160
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,218
Sammy had no drive,
no reason to make it work.

161
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,890
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

162
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,161
"Today, 1:00 p.m. Meet Natalie for info.

163
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,831
She has also lost someone.

164
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,334
She will help you out of pity."

165
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,061
- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.

166
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:47,065
- Sorry. I should have explained. I have this...
- You did explain, Lenny.

167
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,526
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

168
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,196
- Yeah, I know. You told me.
- Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

169
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,698
Yeah.

170
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,201
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...

171
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,248
Thanks. So you have information for me?

172
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,084
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

173
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,045
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple ofscraps of paper.

174
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,922
You mix your laundry list
with your grocery list...

175
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,175
and you'll end up
eating your underwear for breakfast.

176
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,012
I guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

177
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,266
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

178
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,311
I'm sorry I don't rememberyou.
It's nothing personal.

179
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,566
I do have information for you.

180
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,235
You gave me a license plate number.

181
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,530
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

182
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,074
Guess what name came up.

183
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,662
John Edward Gammell. John G.

184
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,373
- Do you know him?
- No.

185
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,543
But his face on his driver's license
looked really familiar.

186
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,629
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

187
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,715
Here's a copy of his license,
his registration, photo and all.

188
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,301
Are you sure you want this?

189
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,179
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

190
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,014
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

191
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,809
But even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

192
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,977
You're not even gonna know that it happened.

193
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,397
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn't make
any difference whether I know about it.

194
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,735
Just because there are things I don't remember
doesn't make my actions meaningless.

195
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,780
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes, does it?

196
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:21,493
Anyway, maybe I'll take
a photograph to remind myself...

197
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,745
get another freaky tattoo.

198
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,126
Tell me about her again.

199
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,712
Why?

200
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,714
Because you like to remember her.

201
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,386
She was beautiful.

202
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:46,017
- To me, she was perfect.
- No. Don'tjust recite the words.

203
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,064
Close your eyes... and remember her.

204
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,744
You can just feel the details.

205
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,457
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

206
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,965
And you can feel these extreme moments...

207
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,967
<i>even if you don't want to.

208
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,639
<i>You put these together,
and you get the feel ofa person.

209
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,145
Enough to know how much you miss them...

210
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,653
<i>and how much you hate
the person who took them away.

211
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,666
I added an address in here.

212
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,211
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside oftown.

213
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,214
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

214
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,344
It's isolated.

215
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,346
Sounds perfect.

216
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,310
- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn't helping you for money.

217
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,604
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

218
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,814
See, you have this condition.

219
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,820
Are you still staying at the Discount Inn,
room 304? You left it at my place.

220
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,827
Yeah.

221
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,499
- They treating you okay?
- I don't remember.

222
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,379
You know what we have in common?

223
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,841
We are both survivors.

224
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,262
You take care, Leonard.

225
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,876
"Remember Sammy Jankis."

226
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:21,756
I met Sammy through work.
Insurance. I was an investigator.

227
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,718
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony.

228
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,886
I had to see through people's bullshit.

229
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,764
It was useful experience,
'cause now it's my life.

230
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,684
When I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.

231
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,687
I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

232
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,065
<i>My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was just let them talk...

233
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,526
<i>and watch the eyes and the body language.

234
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,196
<i>If someone scratches their nose while they're
talking, experts tell you it means they're lying.

235
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,783
<i>It really means they're nervous.
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

236
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,076
<i>It's all about context.

237
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,037
Yeah, I was good.

238
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,123
Sammy was my first real challenge.

239
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,174
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

240
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,552
- Things change.
- So I see.

241
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,722
- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.

242
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,809
Only every time I see you.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

243
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,692
- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Yeah.

244
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:27,322
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.
What about John G? You think he's still here?

245
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,657
- Who?
- Johnny G., the guy you're looking for.

246
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,327
- That's why you haven't left town, am I right?
- Maybe.

247
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,705
- Leonard, look. You have to be very careful.
- Why?

248
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,209
The other day you mentioned that maybe
somebody was trying to set you up...

249
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,044
get you to kill the wrong guy.

250
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,214
I go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

251
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,342
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

252
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,220
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

253
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,971
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please!

254
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,390
No, really. Memory's not perfect.
It's not even that good.

255
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,019
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

256
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,064
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

257
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,942
They collect facts, they make notes,
and they draw conclusions.

258
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,069
Facts, not memories.

259
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,613
That's how you investigate.
I know. It's what I used to do.

260
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,909
Memory can change the shape ofa room.
It can change the color of a car.

261
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,078
And memories can be distorted.

262
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,330
They're just an interpretation.
They're not a record.

263
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,499
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

264
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,293
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

265
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,171
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

266
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,093
He destroyed my ability to live.

267
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,014
You're living.

268
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,810
Only for revenge.

269
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,729
Then we'll get the bastard.
Where you staying?

270
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,276
The Discount Inn.

271
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,821
I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.

272
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,739
Probably left it in your room.

273
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,299
Hi. I'm checked in here,
but I think I've misplaced my key.

274
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,636
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

275
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,907
- Don't see my key anywhere.
- Shit.

276
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,075
This is the wrong room.
You're in 304 now.

277
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,161
- I'm sorry. I fucked up.
- This is not my room?

278
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,746
No. Let's go.

279
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,832
Why is this my handwriting?

280
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,797
This was your room,
but now you're in 304.

281
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,133
- When was I in here?
- Last week.

282
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,677
But then I rented you
another room on top of it.

283
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,888
- Why?
- Business is slow.

284
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,849
I told my boss
about your condition and stuff...

285
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,143
and he said,
"Try and rent him another room."

286
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,270
How many rooms am I checked
into in this shit-hole?

287
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,814
Just two, so far.

288
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,568
At least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

289
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,196
You're not gonna remember anyway.

290
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,198
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

291
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,910
Leonard, always get a receipt.

292
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,204
Yeah. I'm gonna write that down.

293
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,750
- What time is it?
- Quarter to 1:00.

294
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,505
Your room's...

295
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,353
- Natalie?
- You don't remember me.

296
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,606
I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

297
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:52,402
Mr. Samuel R. Jankis. Strangest case ever.

298
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,280
You know, the guy's a 58-year-old
semiretired accountant.

299
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:58,032
He and his wife had been in this car accident.
Nothing too serious.

300
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,327
<i>But he's acting funny.
He can't get a handle on what's going on.

301
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,581
<i>The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus.

302
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:10,211
<i>Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can't remember
anything for more than a couple of minutes.

303
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,047
<i>Can't work, can't do shit.
The medical bills pile up.

304
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,842
<i>His wife calls the insurance company,
and I get sent in.

305
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:20,805
<i>Now, this is my first big claims investigation,
so I really check into it.

306
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:26,102
<i>Sammy can think just fine,
but he can't make any new memories.

307
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,521
<i>He could only remember things
for a couple of minutes.

308
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,315
- This is Mr. Shelby.
<i>- He'd watch TV...

309
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,734
<i>but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing.

310
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,654
<i>He couldn't remember how it began.
He liked commercials. They were short.

311
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,823
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

312
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,784
<i>The crazy part was that this guy...

313
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,079
<i>who couldn't even follow the plot
of Green Acres anymore...

314
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,248
<i>could do the most complicated things...

315
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,710
<i>as long as he learned them
before the accident...

316
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,297
<i>and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.

317
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,132
Be gentle.

318
00:27:56,216 --> 00:28:00,511
<i>The doctors assure me there's a real condition
called anterograde memory loss...

319
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,555
<i>or short-term memory loss.

320
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,640
<i>It's rare, but legit.

321
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,394
<i>But every time I see him...

322
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,147
<i>I catch this look...

323
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,817
<i>this slight look of recognition.

324
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,737
<i>But he says he can't remember me at all.

325
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,947
Sammy, it's okay. I got it. I got it.

326
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,867
- Hi, Mr. Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

327
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,913
<i>I can read people,
and I'm thinking: Bad actor.

328
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,500
So now I'm suspicious, and I order more tests.

329
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,088
Awake.

330
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,800
Where am I?

331
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,430
Somebody's bedroom.

332
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,101
It must be her room.

333
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,229
But who is she?

334
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,447
It's only me.

335
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,661
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yeah. You?

336
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,125
Oh, shit. I gotta be someplace.

337
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,632
- It's pretty weird.
- It's useful.

338
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,635
You never write a phone number on your hand?

339
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:28,182
I should be able to talk to my friend
today about the license plate.

340
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:32,103
- Yeah, the license plate.
- John G.'s license plate.

341
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,233
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

342
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,086
"Natalie."

343
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,674
"She has also lost someone.

344
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,676
She will help you out of pity."

345
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,850
If it's registered in this state...

346
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,936
it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration.

347
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,813
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

348
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:19,901
Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.

349
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,495
It's great that you...

350
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:36,083
that you're helping me like this.

351
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,670
I'm helping you because you helped me.

352
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:55,645
So next time you see me,
will you remember me?

353
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,664
I think you will.

354
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,125
I'm sorry.

355
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,090
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

356
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,317
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

357
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,778
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

358
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,199
But I find something
in my research: Conditioning.

359
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:53,286
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

360
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,789
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You just get better through practice.

361
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,375
It's a completely different part ofthe brain
from the short-term memory.

362
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,545
So I had the doctors test
Sammy's response to conditioning.

363
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,797
Just pick up any three objects.

364
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,049
That's a test?

365
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,719
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

366
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:11,971
Sorry.

367
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,768
Ow! What the fuck?

368
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,063
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

369
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,567
<i>Some ofthe objects were electrified.

370
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,028
<i>They'd give him a small shock.
They kept repeating the test...

371
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,071
always with the same objects electrified.

372
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,742
The point was to see if Sammy could learn
to avoid the electrified objects...

373
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,827
not by memory, but by instinct.

374
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,517
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

375
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,232
- Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
- What the fuck have you got me into?

376
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,817
Come inside.

377
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,990
- Who is he?
- Calm down. Okay?

378
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:16,577
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It has nothing to do with your investigation.

379
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,162
How did you get me into this?

380
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,289
You offered to help when you saw
what he did to my face.

381
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,959
- How do I know he did that to your face?
- Because I came straight to you after he did it.

382
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,295
I showed you what he did,
and I asked you to help me.

383
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,339
- And I just take your word?
- Yeah.

384
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,717
Something doesn't feel right.

385
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:34,345
I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

386
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,846
- Did you?
- What?

387
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,349
- Kill him?
- Of course not!

388
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,475
Hey.

389
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,394
Sit down, okay? Sit.

390
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,314
This has nothing to do with you.

391
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,775
You helped me out, and I'm grateful.

392
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,569
You have to burn them.

393
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,158
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust yourself.

394
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,244
Trust your own judgment.
You can question everything.

395
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:02,081
- You can never know anything for sure.
- There are things you know for sure.

396
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,290
Such as?

397
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,586
I know what that's gonna sound like
when I knock on it.

398
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,673
I know what that's gonna
feel like when I pick it up.

399
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,427
See? Certainties. It's the kind
of memory you take for granted.

400
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,431
You know, I can remember so much.

401
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:23,728
The feel ofthe world... and her.

402
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,153
She's gone.

403
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:36,198
And the present is trivia,
which I scribble down as fucking notes!

404
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:39,201
Hey. Come on. Try and relax. Come on.

405
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,620
It's not easy for me to relax, you know?

406
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,373
Come on. Take your jacket off.

407
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,001
Now. Come on.

408
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,546
Hey.

409
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,425
Didn't think you were the type.

410
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,476
It's backwards.

411
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,228
Come here.

412
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,980
Come here.

413
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,921
What about here?

414
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,674
Maybe it's for when I find him.

415
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,846
I've lost somebody too.

416
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,266
I'm sorry.

417
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,560
His name was Jimmy.

418
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,688
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

419
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,732
He never came back.

420
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,486
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

421
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,781
What do the police think?

422
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,742
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.

423
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,373
When you find this guy, this John G...

424
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,417
what are you gonna do?

425
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,088
I'm gonna kill him.

426
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,675
Maybe I can help you find him.

427
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,182
I don't even know how long she's been gone.

428
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,565
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

429
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,444
because she's gone to
the bathroom or something.

430
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,493
But somehow I just...

431
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,539
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

432
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:59,592
If I could just reach over
and touch her side ofthe bed...

433
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,387
I would know that it was cold.

434
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,517
But I can't.

435
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,440
I know I can't have her back.

436
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:20,154
But I don't want to wake up
in the morning thinking she's still here.

437
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:26,076
I lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.

438
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,921
How can I heal?

439
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:44,470
How am I supposed to heal
if I can't... feel time?

440
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,795
"She has also lost someone.

441
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,339
She will help you out of pity."

442
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,616
They kept testing Sammy for months...

443
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,494
always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

444
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,330
Ow! What the fuck?

445
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,833
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

446
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,627
Even with total short-term memory loss...

447
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,464
<i>Sammy should have learned to instinctively stop
picking up the wrong objects.

448
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:47,593
<i>All the previous cases responded to conditioning.
Sammy didn't respond at all.

449
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,263
<i>It was enough to suggest that his condition
was psychological, not physical.

450
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,808
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

451
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,604
His wife got stuck with the bills,
and I got a big promotion.

452
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,984
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

453
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,986
But it works for me.

454
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,447
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

455
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,949
Habit and routine make my life possible.

456
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,952
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

457
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:23,962
Awake.

458
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,216
Where am I?

459
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,427
Motel room.

460
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,561
Some anonymous motel room.

461
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:46,485
Nothing in the drawers,
but I'll take a look anyway.

462
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:50,030
Nothing except the Gideon Bible.

463
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,255
Lenny! Open up!

464
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,050
Just a minute.

465
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,677
Open the door.

466
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,013
Lenny.

467
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,768
Open the door.

468
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,773
Come on!

469
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,360
Hi, Teddy.

470
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,696
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

471
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,960
I get it.

472
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,503
Amorous neighbors.

473
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,046
What are you doing here?

474
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,842
You called me. You said you needed my help.

475
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,470
I've had more rewarding
friendships than this one.

476
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,891
Although I do get to keep
telling the same jokes.

477
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,643
What the fuck is that?

478
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,151
- Who the fuck is that?
- You don't know him?

479
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,861
No! Should I?

480
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,571
Wait a minute.

481
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,115
- Is that John G?
- I don't think so.

482
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,493
- You don't think so? You didn't write it down?
- I might've fallen asleep before I did.

483
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,579
For Christ's sakes!

484
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,415
Ask him.

485
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,046
What's your name?

486
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,130
Your name.

487
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,549
- Dodd.
- Who did this to you?

488
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:35,219
- What?
- Who did this to you?

489
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,803
You did.

490
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,310
- I'm not gonna help you kill that guy.
- No, just let me think for a minute.

491
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,526
Okay, Natalie. Who's Natalie?

492
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,070
- Natalie who?
- Why?

493
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,240
- Maybe I know her.
- Look. We gotta get him out of here.

494
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,784
All right, all right.

495
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,870
He's gotta have a car, right?

496
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:05,540
We take him down to his car, tell him to get
the fuck out oftown or we're gonna kill him.

497
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,709
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

498
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,254
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know.

499
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,297
You don't know.

500
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,385
Yes, I do. This is not my room.

501
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,262
It must be his room. Great! Let's go.

502
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,305
- No, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

503
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,935
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

504
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,647
Okay. We untie him...

505
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,608
we clean him up, and we march him
out of here with a gun in his back.

506
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,652
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

507
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,490
It must be his. I don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

508
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,326
Fucking hope not.

509
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,168
Which one?

510
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,716
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

511
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,758
Shut up.

512
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,261
That's all right for you to say.
You're the one with the Jag.

513
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,222
Get in.
I'm gonna ride with him. You follow us.

514
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,224
Give me your keys.

515
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,518
Take your own car.

516
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,507
- So was he scared?
- Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache.

517
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,302
Fuck you. You should have stolen his car.

518
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,430
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

519
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,852
So what do you do now?

520
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,396
I'm going to find out
what the fuck that was all about.

521
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:01,406
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

522
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,079
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost ofsupporting him...

523
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,247
and fighting the company's decision.

524
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,418
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

525
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:16,505
<i>- I never said that Sammy was faking.</i>
- Listen. I have an idea.

526
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,215
Sammy, I have an idea.

527
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,967
<i>Just that his problem was mental, not physical.

528
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:24,304
I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?

529
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,932
<i>- But she couldn't understand.</i>
- You're gonna have a pad in your pocket.

530
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,017
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

531
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:32,229
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try harder.

532
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,439
<i>She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person.

533
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:37,651
<i>If it's not a physical problem,
he should just snap out of it.

534
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,444
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called?

535
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:44,157
- Ellen can't come today! Ellen can't come!
- Okay. I'm sorry!

536
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,369
- I'm sorry. I'm trying. I'm sorry.
- Try harder!

537
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:55,252
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed ofdoubt...

538
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,963
just like he gave it to the doctors.

539
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,466
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.

540
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:10,183
I don't feel drunk.

541
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,882
- Hello?
- Shit.

542
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,383
Housekeeping.

543
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,552
- Not right now.
- I'm sorry.

544
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,743
Okay.

545
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:00,585
"Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
orjust get rid of him for Natalie."

546
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:07,759
Dodd.

547
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:16,309
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

548
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:19,813
Teddy, Teddy.

549
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,493
<i>Leave your number.
You know what to do.

550
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,745
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

551
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,872
I'm at the Mountcrest Inn
of Fifth Street, room six.

552
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,959
I need you to come over
as soon as you get this. It's important.

553
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,295
This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

554
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,092
Fuck.

555
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:02,147
What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was
that you can't bully someone into remembering.

556
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,232
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

557
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,987
Then call me back?

558
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,719
Okay. What am I doing?

559
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,681
I'm chasing this guy.

560
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,936
No. He's chasing me.

561
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,378
Fuck.

562
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,092
"Dodd. White guy.

563
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,135
Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street."

564
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:17,764
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

565
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,760
Fuck.

566
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,764
Sorry.

567
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,300
I need a weapon.

568
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,721
This'll do.

569
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,872
I don't feel drunk.

570
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,541
Do I know this guy?

571
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,544
He seems to know me.

572
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:58,800
What the fuck?

573
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,566
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

574
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,651
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

575
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:19,195
I haven't made a strong enough
impression on you?

576
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,281
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

577
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:33,918
Okay. What am I doing?

578
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:46,306
Who is this?

579
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,844
Ouch. Cut it out.

580
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,796
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.

581
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,924
Yeah, but you've read it,
like, a thousand times.

582
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,592
I enjoy it.

583
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,596
I always thought the pleasure of a book
was in wanting to know what happens next.

584
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,390
Don't be a prick.

585
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,059
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

586
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,688
Just let me read, please.

587
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,909
Probably tried this before.

588
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,873
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

589
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,419
Can't remember to forget you.

590
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:40,813
Yeah.

591
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,607
Uh-huh.

592
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:47,570
Sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

593
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:51,532
I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle.
Can you hang on a sec?

594
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,377
The police report mentioned
the drugs found in the car outside my house.

595
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:05,546
The car was stolen,
but his prints were all over it.

596
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,341
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy of it.

597
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,718
I dealt with the police a lot
in my insurancejob.

598
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:14,889
With my condition, it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

599
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,226
I have to summarize the different sections.
And there's pages missing.

600
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,478
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

601
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,814
I don't know why these are crossed out.

602
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,816
But they weren't even looking for John G.

603
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,652
The stuffthey found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened...

604
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,654
so they didn't chase any of it up.

605
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:06,858
Honey.

606
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,154
Honey, it's late.

607
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,303
Everything okay?

608
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,405
You okay in there?

609
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,619
Was it good foryou?

610
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,749
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

611
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,751
No.

612
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,088
I'd like you to leave now.

613
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,154
There's something about the drugs stashed
in the car that doesn't ring true for me.

614
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,740
Because the police claim
the guy was an addict...

615
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,825
needing money to score,
which I think is bullshit...

616
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,162
'cause he's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

617
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:46,791
I think John G. Left it there
or planted it there.

618
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:50,628
How do you know that?

619
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,090
Shit. That's true. It fits.

620
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,759
So he's a dealer.

621
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,345
Hang on a sec.

622
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:11,482
Now we're getting somewhere.

623
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,150
"Discount Inn."

624
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,332
Yeah, okay. Blonde's fine.

625
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,836
That's what they say.

626
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,047
The Discount Inn. 304.

627
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,090
Leonard.

628
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,926
What then?

629
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,221
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

630
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,390
You go into the bathroom and you slam the door.

631
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:29,018
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

632
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,062
- And that's it?
- That's it.

633
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,901
First I just need you to put
these things around the room.

634
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,074
Just pretend they're your things
and that this is your bedroom.

635
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:59,757
- Should I wear it?
- No. Just like you took it off or something.

636
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,137
I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

637
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,933
I just mean put them
around the room...

638
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:11,602
as ifthey were your things.

639
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,109
Whatever gets you off.

640
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,635
I can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

641
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,054
This is a difficult condition
for people to understand.

642
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:50,391
Look at Sammy Jankis.
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

643
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,018
I told you about how she tried
to get him to snap out of it.

644
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,439
Eventually she came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.

645
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,400
<i>She told me about life with Sammy,
how she treated him.

646
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,943
Thank you for seeing me.

647
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,779
It got to the point where she'd get Sammy
to hide food all around the house.

648
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,614
Then she'd stop feeding him
to see if his hunger...

649
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,658
would make him remember
where he'd hidden the food.

650
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:12,621
<i>She wasn't a cruel person.
She just wanted old Sammy back.

651
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:16,500
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy
and you've decided that he's faking.

652
01:03:16,585 --> 01:03:19,211
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position
isn't that Sammy is faking anything...

653
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,213
just that his condition can't be shown to be...

654
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:24,758
I just want to know
what your honest opinion about Sammy is.

655
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,761
We shouldn't even be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

656
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:31,098
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

657
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:33,642
Try to understand.
When I look at Sammy...

658
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,188
I don't see some... vegetable.

659
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:39,356
I see my same old Sammy.

660
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:45,946
What do you think that's like for me to suspect
he might be imagining this whole problem...

661
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,115
and that if I just could say the right thing...

662
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,993
he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal?

663
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,336
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone...

664
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,548
then I could say good-bye
and start loving this new Sammy.

665
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,386
As long as I have doubt,
I can't say good-bye and move on.

666
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,222
What do you want from me?

667
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:14,475
I want you to forget the company
you work for for 30 seconds...

668
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:18,229
and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

669
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:23,484
I need to know... what you honestly believe.

670
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,409
I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

671
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,418
Thank you.

672
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:47,007
I thought I helped her. I thought
she just needed some kind of answer.

673
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,093
I didn't think it was important
what the answer was...

674
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,929
just that she had one to believe.

675
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,863
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

676
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,283
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it.

677
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,995
Sammy. Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

678
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,039
Geez!

679
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:21,041
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

680
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,252
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?

681
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:26,297
- Do you even know why you're here?
- Unfinished business.

682
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:28,757
Lenny, let me inform you.

683
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,218
Your business here is very much finished.

684
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:34,305
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

685
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,516
Schmuck, whose house do you think
you just walked out of?

686
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:43,314
That's right. Take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.

687
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,526
Nice shot, Leibovitz.

688
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,363
You'll wanna make a note.
You can't trust her.

689
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:52,823
Yeah? Why's that?

690
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:56,160
Because by now she's taken
a look at this suit and the car...

691
01:05:56,244 --> 01:06:00,623
and she's starting to figure out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

692
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,043
She's already got you staying
with her, for Christ's sakes.

693
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,713
You can't go back in there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.

694
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,675
- You're lucky I ran into you. That broad's bad news.
- What do you mean, "bad news"?

695
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,053
She's involved with drugs.

696
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,430
Look. These. You see these?

697
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,474
This is the bar where she works.

698
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,601
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

699
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,312
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

700
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,273
He writes messages on the back of these.

701
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,901
Then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

702
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:33,072
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up...

703
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,324
she's gonna use you to protect herself.

704
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,617
From who?

705
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,453
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

706
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:43,082
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody's gotta pay, Lenny.

707
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:46,210
Somebody always pays.
Maybe she'll make it you.

708
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:49,797
Oh, yeah?
Maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

709
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,799
You worried that she's gonna use me against you?

710
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:53,884
- No.
- Why not?

711
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,221
Because she doesn't know who I am.

712
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,766
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.

713
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,770
She doesn't know anything about
your investigation, okay, Einstein?

714
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,523
So write this down.

715
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:12,277
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

716
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:17,157
I'm not lying.
Take my pen. Write this down.

717
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,410
Do not trust her.

718
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:30,337
- There. You happy now?
- I won't be happy until you leave town.

719
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,339
Why not?

720
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:35,926
You ever wonder how long you can hang around
here before people start asking questions?

721
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,094
What sort of questions?

722
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,304
The same sort of questions
you should be asking yourself.

723
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,932
- Like what?
- Like, how did you get this suit, the car?

724
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,642
- I have money.
- From what?

725
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:47,104
My wife's death. I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.

726
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,943
So in your griefyou wandered
into a Jaguar dealership.

727
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,448
You don't have a clue, do you?

728
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:00,075
- You don't even know who you are.
- Yes, I do.

729
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,912
I don't have amnesia. I remember
everything right up until the incident.

730
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,789
I am Leonard Shelby.
I am from San Francisco...

731
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:10,502
That's who you were.
You do not know who you are...

732
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:14,506
what you've become since... the incident.

733
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,134
You wander around playing detective.

734
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,803
You don't even know how long ago it was.

735
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:25,601
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

736
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:29,480
- I didn't sell insurance. I investigated it.
- Right. You're an investigator.

737
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:35,027
- Maybe you should start investigating yourself.
- Thank you for the advice.

738
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,823
Look, do me a favor.
Don't go back in there.

739
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:42,618
Will you take the motel out of town?

740
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:48,165
It's been fun, Lenny.

741
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,132
"Do not trust her."

742
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,928
"Don't believe his lies."

743
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,068
Fuck it. I need my own place.

744
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,954
No. She shouldn't have
given me that responsibility.

745
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,706
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

746
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,335
Yeah. I guess.

747
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,796
But I've got all sorts of other considerations.

748
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,091
Legal responsibility, large financial...

749
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,556
Who is this?

750
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,028
Write this down.
Write down what happened. Write it down.

751
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:02,447
Concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a pen.

752
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,205
What happened?

753
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:12,332
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

754
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,792
Who?

755
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:15,627
Who?

756
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,754
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

757
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,756
- Why?
- Why? Because ofyou.

758
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,551
Because I did what you told me to do!
Go in and reason with him!

759
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:26,179
- Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!
- Calm down. Take it easy.

760
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:28,098
You're safe. It's okay.

761
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,977
Come on. Just sit down.

762
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,979
Sit down.

763
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,981
Here. Sit down.

764
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,901
Okay. You're okay.

765
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,278
I'll just get some ice for your face.

766
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,203
Here.

767
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:59,046
I did exactly what you told me to do.

768
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,299
I went to Dodd...

769
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,803
and I told him
that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...

770
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:09,348
or the drugs...

771
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:14,144
and that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

772
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,854
And what did he say?

773
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,857
He didn't believe me.

774
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:24,446
He said if I don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

775
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,990
Then he just started hitting me.

776
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,620
Where is he?

777
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,623
- Why?
- I'll go see him.

778
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:35,707
And?

779
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:39,002
I'll give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

780
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,505
He'll kill you, Lenny.

781
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,425
My wife used to call me Lenny.

782
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,927
Yeah?

783
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,597
Yeah. I hated it.

784
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:54,184
This guy is so dangerous.

785
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:57,813
- Let's just think of something else, okay?
- No, no.

786
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:01,942
You just tell me what he looks like...
and where I can find him.

787
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:05,570
- Have you got a pen?
- In my purse.

788
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,499
He'll probably find you.

789
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,919
- What do you mean?
- I told him about your car.

790
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:22,713
Why?

791
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,051
He was beating the shit out of me.
I had to tell him something.

792
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:30,887
Just write it all down.

793
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,279
Be careful.

794
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,282
I'll be fine.

795
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,417
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

796
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:17,768
Front desk?

797
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:20,437
Burt. Right.
This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

798
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:23,607
Yeah, that's the thing.
I don't want any calls.

799
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:25,776
Nope. None at all.

800
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,663
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

801
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,707
- Who?
- He calls himself Dodd.

802
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,209
What does he want?

803
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:45,253
He wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks I took it.

804
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,463
Did you?

805
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:48,840
No.

806
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,805
- What's this all about?
- Fuck!

807
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:58,767
You don't have a fucking clue, do you?
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't ya?

808
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:02,395
- I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!

809
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,899
Probably know more about it than you do.
You don't have a fucking clue about anything else.

810
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,067
What happened?

811
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,986
What happened is that Jimmy
went to meet some guy named Teddy.

812
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,781
He took a lot of money with him,
and he never came back.

813
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,451
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know if you know this Teddy, or how well.

814
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:18,203
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him!

815
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,329
- I'm not.
- Help me.

816
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:20,664
How?

817
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,916
Get rid of Dodd for me.

818
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,043
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.

819
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,171
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

820
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:30,298
What then? Love?

821
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,092
What would you kill for?

822
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,761
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

823
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:38,348
- Not to me. I wasn't fucking married to her.
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

824
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,684
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

825
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,228
I can say whatever I want
and you won't remember.

826
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,438
I could call your wife a fucking whore
and we could still be friends.

827
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,732
- Calm down.
- Easy for you to say. You can't get scared.

828
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:51,403
- You don't know how, you fucking idiot!
- Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.

829
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,990
Maybe it does. How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

830
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,411
- You can't get scared, but can you get angry?
- Yes.

831
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,830
You pathetic piece of shit.

832
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,999
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

833
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,668
and you won't have a fucking clue,
you fucking retard!

834
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,254
- Shut your mouth.
- You know what? I'm gonna use you.

835
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,840
I'm telling you now,
because I'm gonna enjoy it so much more...

836
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:15,468
if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

837
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,345
Did you lose your pen?

838
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,849
That's too bad, freak. Otherwise,
you could write yourself a little note...

839
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,519
about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts
and that I called your wife a fuckin' whore.

840
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:27,314
- Don't say another fuckin' word.
- About your whore of a wife?

841
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,153
I read about your condition, Leonard.

842
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:37,824
You know what one ofthe causes
of short-term memory loss is? Venereal disease.

843
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:42,787
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife
sucked one too many diseased cocks...

844
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,581
and turned you into a fucking retard!

845
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:50,086
You sad, sad freak.

846
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,257
I can say whatever the fuck I want...

847
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:56,760
and you won't remember.

848
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,638
We'll still be best friends...

849
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:03,266
or maybe even lovers.

850
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:06,686
Fuck.

851
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,694
I'll see you soon.

852
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,412
Stay focused. Find a pen.

853
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,624
Gotta write this down. Gotta write it down.

854
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,670
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

855
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:35,340
Keep it in mind.
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.

856
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,720
Come on. Gotta find a pen.
I gotta find a pen.

857
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:44,766
Write this down.
Write this down, exactly what happened.

858
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,726
Gonna write down exactly what happened.
Come on.

859
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:49,145
I gotta find a pen. Geez! Come on.

860
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,648
Keep focused. Keep focused.

861
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,193
Keep it in mind.
Come on. Find a pen.

862
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:57,112
Write this note.
Write down what happened.

863
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,490
Write it down. Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.

864
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,292
What happened?

865
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,460
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

866
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:13,795
Who?

867
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,588
Who?

868
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:18,008
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

869
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:28,727
Hello?

870
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:34,566
It's Burt, from the front desk.

871
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,237
- Yeah?
- I know you said you didn't want any calls.

872
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:41,865
But this guy called.
He's on the phone now. He says he's a cop.

873
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,408
- A cop?
- Yeah.

874
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,037
He says you're really gonna wanna
know what he has to say.

875
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:50,707
I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look
people in the eye when I talk to them.

876
01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:00,675
You can crash on the couch.
It's comfortable.

877
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,552
Just have a seat.

878
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,095
Thanks.

879
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,061
How long do you think it's gonna take you?

880
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,815
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife?

881
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:20,528
That depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on.

882
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:23,740
I have my file here.

883
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:29,871
Can I ask you something?
If you have all ofthat information...

884
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,332
then why haven't the police
found him foryou?

885
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,752
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

886
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:40,757
They don't think he exists.
You see, I told them what I remembered.

887
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:42,967
I was asleep.

888
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,179
Something woke me up.

889
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:54,104
<i>Her side ofthe bed was cold.
She'd obviously been out of bed for a while.

890
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,664
There had to be a second man.

891
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,333
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

892
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,335
It's about the last thing that I do remember.

893
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,172
Look. The police did not believe me.
If we check the police...

894
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:06,050
How did they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff.

895
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,306
John G. was clever.

896
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,891
He was clever.

897
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:17,687
See, he took the dead man's gun,
he replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.

898
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:22,358
He left my gun and he left the get away car.
He gave the police a complete package.

899
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:26,196
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

900
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,199
And they only found my gun.

901
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,910
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

902
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,581
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts,
and I had brain damage.

903
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,292
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

904
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:43,463
Leonard, you can stay here
for a couple of days if it'll help you.

905
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:47,050
Thanks.

906
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:49,594
I have to go back to work.

907
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,930
So, just make yourself at home.

908
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:55,850
You can watch TV oryou can have some food,
whatever you want, okay?

909
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:58,603
- Make yourself at home.
- One thing.

910
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:05,443
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

911
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,822
"Natalie."

912
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:44,190
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

913
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,491
- On the house.
- Thanks.

914
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:42,999
You really do have a problem.

915
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,501
Just like that cop said.

916
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:48,254
Your condition.

917
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,840
Nobody's perfect.

918
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:55,845
What's the last thing that you do remember?

919
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,100
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

920
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:02,060
Dying.

921
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,438
I remember my wife dying.

922
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:12,111
Let me get you another one.

923
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:15,031
I think this one's dusty.

924
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,537
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

925
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:25,083
I know you're a cop, but what do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

926
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:28,127
I don't know. Something bad, maybe.

927
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:34,592
Why are you asking me? I can't remember
what I've done. You wouldn't believe me anyway.

928
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:37,595
Because of my condition.
You don't believe someone with this condition.

929
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,640
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

930
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:42,975
"Ferdy's Bar."

931
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,939
"Come by after. Natalie."

932
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:03,830
I'll have a beer, please.

933
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,915
- What do you want?
- A beer, please.

934
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,418
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

935
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,837
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

936
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,881
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- That's me.

937
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,175
Yeah. We met before, right?

938
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,804
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know. Why don't you tell me.

939
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,348
I don't remember. I have no short-term memory.
It's not amnesia.

940
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:25,101
- You're the memory guy.
- How do you know about me?

941
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:27,645
My boyfriend told me about you.

942
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,649
- Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

943
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,277
No.

944
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:37,822
He knows you. He told me about you.

945
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,991
He said you were staying at the Discount.

946
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,119
In fact, a cop came by earlier,
was looking for you.

947
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,371
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything...

948
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:47,790
wouldn't know how he got here
or what he'd done.

949
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,418
Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.

950
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:53,963
Chronic alcoholism is one cause
of short-term memory loss.

951
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,760
- Are you Teddy?
- No. My name's Leonard.

952
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:00,970
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.

953
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:05,224
- What's happened to Jimmy?
- I don't know that either.

954
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,685
- Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

955
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:11,105
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done.

956
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,817
No. I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

957
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:17,612
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.

958
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,408
Your pocket.

959
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:50,186
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

960
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,605
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

961
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:56,150
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

962
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:09,705
Thank you.

963
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,225
- On the house.
- Thanks.

964
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,399
It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

965
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:40,862
It's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

966
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,739
I guess it's some kind of poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

967
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:45,992
You know the truth about my condition, Officer?

968
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,828
You don't know anything.

969
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,080
You feel angry, you don't know why.

970
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:53,916
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

971
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:57,378
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea 10 minutes later.

972
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,839
Like Sammy.
What if I've done something like Sammy?

973
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:03,801
I didn't tell you what happened
to Sammy and his wife?

974
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:08,723
She came to see me at my office. I thought
she was trying to catch me off guard...

975
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:11,726
<i>so I didn't tell her what I really thought,
but I never said that he was faking...

976
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,728
<i>just that his condition was mental,
not physical.

977
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,772
<i>I found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.

978
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:21,444
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

979
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,420
<i>She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.

980
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:42,548
<i>So she found a way to test him.

981
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,856
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

982
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,868
<i>She really thought she'd call his bluff.

983
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,453
There you go.

984
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:16,874
<i>Or she just didn't wanna live
with the things she'd put him through.

985
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:27,843
Sammy.

986
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:32,139
It's time for my shot.

987
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:39,397
It won't hurt.

988
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,568
<i>She went into a coma and never recovered.

989
01:29:26,737 --> 01:29:29,822
<i>Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.

990
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:34,035
He's been in a home ever since.

991
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,537
<i>He doesn't even know that his wife is dead.

992
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:39,999
I was wrong about Sammy,
and I was wrong about his wife.

993
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:42,001
She wasn't interested in the money.

994
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,253
She just needed to understand his problem.

995
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,757
<i>His brain didn't respond to conditioning.
But he wasn't a con man.

996
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:51,260
<i>When she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.

997
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:53,721
<i>When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.

998
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:55,931
Now I know. You fake it.

999
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:58,851
If you think you're supposed to
recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

1000
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,604
<i>You bluff it to get a pat
on the head from the doctors.

1001
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,482
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1002
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:09,820
What drug dealer?

1003
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:38,349
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.

1004
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:41,435
- It's okay. We know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?

1005
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,521
The Jag's out front.
Should have put it around back.

1006
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:47,108
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1007
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:49,693
I guess I wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

1008
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:52,238
- Give me the keys. I'll move it.
- It'll be all right for a minute.

1009
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:53,823
Wait out there.

1010
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:57,243
Give me a minute.
I gotta get something for you.

1011
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:05,042
Fact six: Car license SG137IU.

1012
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:13,342
Look. Wait a minute, will ya?

1013
01:31:16,847 --> 01:31:18,889
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

1014
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:22,268
Man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

1015
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:24,728
- It's not safe for you to hang around here anymore.
- Why not?

1016
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:26,730
Because that cop's looking for you.

1017
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:29,400
I gotta get you a new identity,
some new clothes.

1018
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:32,111
A different car would do for now.
So put these on.

1019
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:33,571
What cop?

1020
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:37,741
He's a bad cop. He's the one
that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1021
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:41,662
He's been calling you for days, telling you shit,
slipping envelopes underyour door. Shit like that.

1022
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,456
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He thinks it's funny.

1023
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,542
- He's been laughing at you.
- You're full of shit.

1024
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:49,461
I'm not. He knows you're no good on the phone,
so he's been calling you.

1025
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:51,547
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1026
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:54,425
so he slips shit under your door to scare you
into answering the phone again...

1027
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:57,178
giving you a line ofcrap about John G.
Being some local drug dealer.

1028
01:31:57,262 --> 01:32:00,514
- Jimmy Grants.
- Who's Jimmy Grants?

1029
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:02,558
Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1030
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,935
The cop wants to know how his operation's run.

1031
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,021
He's got some score in mind.
Somehow you're involved.

1032
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:08,772
Uh-huh. How do you know him?

1033
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:14,570
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out oftown.
The local boys put us together.

1034
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:16,989
If he knew I was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

1035
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:20,868
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

1036
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:23,579
Come on, Leonard. Just go.

1037
01:32:44,226 --> 01:32:46,185
You are full of shit.

1038
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:50,064
"Come by after. Natalie."

1039
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:51,649
"Ferdy's Bar."

1040
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:35,818
Hey, Jimmy.

1041
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:41,657
I'm sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

1042
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,659
Sorry.

1043
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:45,744
That's okay.

1044
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:03,178
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out ofthe bar
where his girlfriend works?

1045
01:34:04,014 --> 01:34:06,515
But he's not gonna bring her along.
He'll come by himself, right?

1046
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,811
I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

1047
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:15,024
No, Officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

1048
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:18,277
You're in the lobby? What do you look like?

1049
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,530
I'll be right there.

1050
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:04,573
Lenny.

1051
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:08,911
Officer Gammell.

1052
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,166
Yeah. Come on.

1053
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,143
- Smile.
- Not here.

1054
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:35,771
Over here.

1055
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:44,446
- Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
- You know what?

1056
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:46,740
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1057
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:49,451
- Why?
- I'm undercover.

1058
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:54,706
This is the directions where he's going.

1059
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:57,835
- My number's on the bottom if you need me.
- You're not coming?

1060
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,837
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1061
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:07,469
Nice picture. I look thin.

1062
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:12,474
Hey, Lenny.

1063
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:14,560
Make him beg.

1064
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:38,894
Teddy!

1065
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,607
Hey, Teddy!

1066
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:51,740
Jimmy.

1067
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:56,119
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

1068
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,205
Expecting any other Jimmys out here,
Memory Man?

1069
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:02,543
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.

1070
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:05,045
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1071
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:05,837
Well?

1072
01:38:09,968 --> 01:38:12,761
Motherfuck... Fuckin' retard!

1073
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,933
- Strip.
- You're making a big fucking mistake, pal.

1074
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:19,309
Strip!

1075
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:23,981
My associates are not
the kind of people you wanna piss off.

1076
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:25,649
Don't say anything else.

1077
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,151
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

1078
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,322
Cocksucker.

1079
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,200
Your pants too.

1080
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,120
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.

1081
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:42,207
Wait. Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1082
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:46,211
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got 200 grand stashed in the car!

1083
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:49,006
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

1084
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,466
- Take the money and walk away!
- I don't want your fuckin' money.

1085
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:53,969
Then what?

1086
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:58,181
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fuckin' life back!

1087
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:29,981
Sammy.

1088
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,824
He said "Sammy".
How does he know about Sammy?

1089
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:40,283
Oh, fuck.

1090
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:02,889
What have I done?

1091
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:07,477
Mister, I need help.
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.

1092
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:09,813
- We gotta get him to a doctor.
- All right.

1093
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:13,900
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.

1094
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,194
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1095
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:19,823
- Is he still breathing?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1096
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,451
What the hell were you guys
doing down here?

1097
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:26,079
I don't remember. I have this condition.

1098
01:41:26,164 --> 01:41:28,874
I hope it's not as serious as his,
'cause this guy's dead.

1099
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,501
Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!

1100
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:35,130
So you remember me now, huh?
You are a fuckin' cop.

1101
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:38,049
Yeah. And I'm the guy
that helped you find him.

1102
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:40,010
Get up. Get up.

1103
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:42,137
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1104
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,892
Who is that? He knew me.

1105
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:49,603
Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.

1106
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,730
Bullshit. He's not the guy.

1107
01:41:51,814 --> 01:41:56,151
His name is James F. Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.

1108
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:58,653
- What was he bringing the 200 grand for?
- What?

1109
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:03,033
- What was it for?
- A load ofamphetamines I told him I had.

1110
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:06,578
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1111
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:10,290
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy. I just
figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1112
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:14,002
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

1113
01:42:14,086 --> 01:42:17,380
The guy at the front desk let him know
if anybody came snooping around.

1114
01:42:17,465 --> 01:42:20,008
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you
taking a picture ofthe dump.

1115
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:22,469
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half!

1116
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:25,180
He knew about Sammy!
Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1117
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:28,642
You tell everybody about Sammy,
everybody who'll listen.

1118
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,852
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1119
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:33,855
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1120
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:36,733
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

1121
01:42:36,818 --> 01:42:38,860
There's nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.

1122
01:42:38,945 --> 01:42:42,072
Who cares if there's a few little details
you'd rather not remember?

1123
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:46,868
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1124
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:49,579
Your wife surviving the assault.

1125
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:52,290
Her not believing your condition.

1126
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:56,545
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

1127
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:58,421
The insulin.

1128
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:02,425
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

1129
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:05,512
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourselfover and over again.

1130
01:43:05,596 --> 01:43:07,597
Conditioning yourself to remember.

1131
01:43:07,682 --> 01:43:10,267
- Learning through repetition.
- Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1132
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:15,397
- Sammy ended up in an institution.
- Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1133
01:43:15,481 --> 01:43:17,649
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1134
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:20,694
You exposed him for what he was... a fraud.

1135
01:43:20,778 --> 01:43:22,737
But I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1136
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:27,158
- See, Sammy's wife came to me.
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1137
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:32,247
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1138
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:39,629
Ouch.

1139
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:43,925
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1140
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,344
You sure?

1141
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:54,269
- Ouch. Cut it out.
- She wasn't diabetic.

1142
01:43:55,271 --> 01:43:59,065
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1143
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:02,569
I guess I can only make you remember
the things you wanna be true.

1144
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:05,030
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1145
01:44:05,114 --> 01:44:07,282
He was to you.

1146
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:10,785
Come on. You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1147
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:13,371
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1148
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:16,082
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1149
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,459
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

1150
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:19,002
I will. Somehow I'll know.

1151
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:21,504
- You won't remember!
- When it's done, I will know. It'll be different.

1152
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:25,508
I thought so too.
In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1153
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:31,556
That's right. The real John G.

1154
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:35,226
I helped you find him over a year ago.
He's already dead.

1155
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:38,188
- Don't lie to me anymore.
- Look, Lenny.

1156
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:41,691
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case.
I believed you.

1157
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:44,319
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

1158
01:44:44,403 --> 01:44:47,697
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy
in your bathroom that night...

1159
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:50,116
the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1160
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:52,661
We found him. You killed him.

1161
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:59,668
But you didn't remember.
So I helped you start looking again...

1162
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:02,003
Looking for the guy you already killed.

1163
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:04,297
Yeah? So who was he?

1164
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:06,758
Just some guy. Does it even matter who?

1165
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:11,388
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.

1166
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:16,351
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1167
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:21,314
But when you killed him,
I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1168
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,858
But it didn't stick.

1169
01:45:23,943 --> 01:45:26,695
Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won't stick.

1170
01:45:31,367 --> 01:45:35,996
I took that picture... just when you did it.

1171
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:39,916
Look how happy you are.

1172
01:45:41,252 --> 01:45:43,003
I wanted to see that face again.

1173
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:45,880
- Gee, thanks.
- Fuck you.

1174
01:45:45,965 --> 01:45:49,718
I gave you a reason to live,
and you were more than happy to help.

1175
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:53,972
You don't want the truth.
You make up your own truth.

1176
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:56,016
Like your police file.

1177
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:59,853
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?

1178
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:02,480
- You, probably.
- No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1179
01:46:02,565 --> 01:46:06,276
- Why would I do that?
- To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1180
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,278
You know how many towns?

1181
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:10,530
How many John G.'s or James G.'s?

1182
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:12,657
Shit, Lenny. I'm a fucking John G.

1183
01:46:12,742 --> 01:46:15,994
- Your name is Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1184
01:46:16,078 --> 01:46:18,955
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1185
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,081
Cheer up.

1186
01:46:20,166 --> 01:46:22,917
There's plenty of John G.'s for us to find.

1187
01:46:26,297 --> 01:46:28,715
All you do is moan.

1188
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:31,134
I'm the one that has to live
with what you've done.

1189
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:32,927
I'm the one that put it all together.

1190
01:46:33,012 --> 01:46:37,682
You wander around, you're playing detective.
You're living a dream, kid.

1191
01:46:37,767 --> 01:46:41,853
A dead wife to pine for.
A sense of purpose to your life.

1192
01:46:41,937 --> 01:46:45,273
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn't in the picture.

1193
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:49,736
- I should kill you.
- Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1194
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,822
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1195
01:46:56,368 --> 01:46:59,120
What are you doing?
You know what time it is?

1196
01:46:59,205 --> 01:47:01,289
It's beer o'clock. I'm buying.

1197
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:04,417
Fuck.

1198
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:15,637
<i>I'm not a killer.

1199
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:19,474
<i>I'm just someone who wanted
to make things right.

1200
01:47:25,523 --> 01:47:27,899
<i>Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?

1201
01:47:45,126 --> 01:47:48,503
<i>Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

1202
01:48:02,768 --> 01:48:04,519
<i>You think I just want another puzzle to solve?

1203
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:07,522
<i>Another John G. To look for?

1204
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:10,608
<i>You're a John G.

1205
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:14,404
<i>So you can be my John G.

1206
01:48:22,872 --> 01:48:24,998
<i>Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1207
01:48:26,292 --> 01:48:28,042
<i>In your case, Teddy...

1208
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:31,087
<i>Yes, I will.

1209
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:46,311
Hey, that's not your car!

1210
01:48:46,395 --> 01:48:48,980
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1211
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:51,983
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1212
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:53,776
Somebody'll recognize it!

1213
01:48:55,237 --> 01:48:58,323
I think I'd rather be mistaken
for a dead guy than a killer.

1214
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:01,784
I might hang on to this for a while.

1215
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:03,912
Lenny.

1216
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:08,458
Will you help me find the keys?

1217
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:10,293
Help me find my keys.

1218
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:35,860
<i>I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

1219
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:38,112
<i>I have to believe that
my actions still have meaning...

1220
01:49:38,197 --> 01:49:40,156
<i>even if I can't remember them.

1221
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:44,994
<i>I have to believe
that when my eyes are closed...

1222
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:47,163
