1
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,378
I'm voting for Dukakis.

2
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,134
Hm...

3
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:31,094
Well...

4
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:36,391
Maybe when you have children
who need braces

5
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:41,814
you can't afford them because half of your husband's pay
cheque goes to the government,

6
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:44,860
- you'll regret that.
- My husband's pay cheque?

7
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:50,658
Anyway I'm not going to squeeze
one out until I'm like 30.

8
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:53,201
Will you still be working at the Yarn Barn?

9
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,412
Because I hear that's a really great place
to raise children.

10
00:04:55,496 --> 00:05:00,043
- That's really funny.
- No, I think a year of partying's enough.

11
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:04,006
- She'll be going to Harvard next fall.
- Mom, I haven't even gotten in yet.

12
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:08,178
You honestly think Michael Dukakis will provide for
this country till you are ready to squeeze one out?

13
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:09,513
Yeah, I do.

14
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,557
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Not until eighth grade.

15
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,729
Excuse me.

16
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,939
Donnie, you're such a dick.

17
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:23,195
Whoa, Elizabeth!
A little hostile there.

18
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:25,531
Maybe you should be the one in therapy,

19
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:28,868
then Mom and Dad can pay someone
200 hundred dollars to listen to all of your thoughts

20
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:30,703
so we don't have to.

21
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:35,167
Ok. You wanna tell mom and dad why
you stopped taking your medication.

22
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,337
You're such a fuck-ass!

23
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:41,841
- Please.
- Did you just call me a fuck-ass?

24
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,719
- Elizabeth, that's enough.
- You can go suck a fuck!

25
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:49,225
- Oh please tell me Elizabeth how exactly does one suck a fuck?
- You want me to tell you?

26
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,394
- Please tell me.
- We will not have this at the dinner table.

27
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,605
- Stop.
- Fuck...

28
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,911
What's a fuck-ass?

29
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,421
Part of the reason I took a year off was to be with you.

30
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:22,137
- What?
- How did you know?

31
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:26,934
- I didn't know it was such a big deal.
- It is a big deal.

32
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:37,445
I'm reading. Get out.

33
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,786
Where do you go at night?

34
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,249
- Will you just get out of my room.
- Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons' house?

35
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,085
- Is that what you came here to ask me?
- No.

36
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,966
I stopped rolling houses
in the sixth grade mom.

37
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,720
What happened to my son?
I don't recognise this person today.

38
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:01,140
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills.

39
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,445
Bitch.

40
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:34,677
Our son just called me a bitch.

41
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,683
You're not a bitch.

42
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:44,314
You're bitching,
but you're not a bitch.

43
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:25,902
I want to be a president of the United States
who makes sure that we

44
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:29,865
never again do business with a
drug-running Panamanian dictator

45
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:33,078
that we never again funnel aid to the Contras
through drug dealers,

46
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,914
Values begin at the top,

47
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:39,126
Dick-akis... Son of a bitch.

48
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:42,755
Those are the values I want
to bring to the presidency

49
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:44,840
and to the White House beginning of January 1989,

50
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:47,385
- Panama is a friendly country
- Tell him, George.

51
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:52,975
I went down there and talked to the president of Panama
about cleaning up their mu.. money laundering,

52
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,479
Mr Noriega was there,
but there was no evidence,

53
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:59,482
When the evidence was there,
we indicted him,

54
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,125
Wake up

55
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,774
I've been watching you,

56
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,577
Come closer,

57
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,466
Closer,

58
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,078
28 days,

59
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,456
six hours,

60
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,084
42 minutes,

61
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,464
12 seconds,

62
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:55,642
That is when the world will end.

63
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:03,327
Why?

64
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:03,885
Son? Donnie Darko?

65
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:09,434
Donnie Darko?
What the heck's going on here?

66
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,811
- Who is it?
- It's Eddie Darko's kid.

67
00:13:11,895 --> 00:13:14,273
He's just a neighbourhood kid.

68
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:18,443
Guess he was sleep-golfing?

69
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:21,113
Watch out for that drool spot!

70
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:28,080
Are you all right, son?

71
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:36,213
So let's stay off
the links at night, Ok?

72
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:40,718
I'm sorry, Dr Fisher.
It... It won't happen again.

73
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,473
- Kids...
- Let's golf.

74
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:01,992
- No one's allowed.
- This is my house.

75
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:04,454
- I said...
- This is my house!

76
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:33,736
Wait a minute.

77
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,700
- There's your brother.
- It fell in your room.

78
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:01,644
Ms Darko? I'm Bob Garland.
I'm with the FAA.

79
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:08,235
- The what?
- I'm with the FAA. If you don't mind we would like
to speak with you and your husband privately?

80
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:10,821
- In private?
- Please.

81
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:32,595
- And here...
- Ok.

82
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:36,558
All right,
we have arranged for you to stay at a hotel.

83
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,520
Get some sleep
and we'll take care of things here.

84
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,480
- Great.
- Thank you.

85
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,234
Kids, come on
we're going to a hotel.

86
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,904
They don't know where it came from.

87
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:07,970
<i>- Where's Pop?
- He's still at work,</i>

88
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:11,890
If it fell from the plane...
then what happened to the plane?

89
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:16,104
They don't know, Samantha.

90
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,319
Is there any way we make money from this?
Can't we get on television if we sue the airline?

91
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:24,238
Shut up, Sam.

92
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,785
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie?
He stinks.

93
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:32,872
When you fall asleep tonight,

94
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:36,751
- I'm gonna fart in your face.
- I'm telling Mom!

95
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:39,922
Samantha, don't go over there.

96
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,266
Frankie Feedler.

97
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:54,064
You remember. From high school.

98
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:05,660
He died. Remember?

99
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,794
On his way to the prom.

100
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:19,968
They said he was doomed.

101
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,224
Jesus.

102
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:32,524
They could be saying
the same thing about Donnie.

103
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:36,903
Our Donnie.

104
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,412
But he dodged it.

105
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:48,667
He dodged his photograph.

106
00:18:07,438 --> 00:18:10,358
Somebody was watching over him.

107
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:22,915
Mrs Farmer will bring you home
after practice. Donnie.... Bye, honey.

108
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:25,126
Donnie... good luck.

109
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:29,546
- Oh, my God! Ok, tell me everything.
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.

110
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,300
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, Cherita.

111
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:36,472
- Chut up!
- Darko cheats death! Huh?

112
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:41,477
You're like a celebrity, man! I've been like calling you
a jillion times. Where you been?

113
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:45,189
- We stayed at a hotel.
- hey, my dad said he saw you at the golf course.

114
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:48,944
- You sleepwalking again there, buddy?
- I don't want to talk about it.

115
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:52,448
And now that you're famous,
you gotta have a smoke.

116
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:59,290
What happens
if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Sam?

117
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:03,920
- You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
- Goddamn right, I will.

118
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:08,383
- So grody.
- Hey, Cherita, you want a cigarette?

119
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:11,427
- Chut up!
- "Shut up!"

120
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:13,847
Go back to China, bitch!

121
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:17,268
Just leave her alone.

122
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:22,566
- That's some good shit, huh?
- It's a fucking cigarette.

123
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:59,535
"There would be headlines
in the papers.

124
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:02,539
"Even the grown-up gangs who ran
the betting at the All-ln wrestling

125
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:04,332
and the barrow-boys
"would hear with respect

126
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,962
of how Old Misery's house
had been destroyed.

127
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:12,426
"lt was as though this plan had
been with him all his life,

128
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:15,888
pondered through the seasons,
"now, in his 15th year,

129
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:18,890
crystallised
with the pain of puberty."

130
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,982
What is Graham Greene trying
to communicate with this passage?

131
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:29,820
Why did the children
break into Old Misery's house?

132
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,450
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

133
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,204
If you had actually
read the short story,

134
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:41,834
Which had a whopping 13 pages,
would have kept you up all night,
you'd know that the children

135
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:45,505
find a great deal of money
in the mattress, but they burn it.

136
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:54,140
Donnie Darko, perhaps with your
recent brush with mass destruction,

137
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:56,268
you can give us your opinion.

138
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,607
Well, they say it right when they flood the
house and they tear it to shreds,

139
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:04,902
that like, destruction
is a form of creation,

140
00:23:05,027 --> 00:23:07,363
so the fact that they burn
the money is ironic.

141
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,993
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

142
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,037
They want to change things.

143
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:23,881
- May we help you?
- Yeah, I just registered.

144
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:28,054
- And they put me in the wrong English class.
- You look like you belong here.

145
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,016
Um... Where do I sit?

146
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:38,440
Sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest.

147
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:40,108
Quiet!

148
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:43,612
Let her choose.

149
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,056
Joanie, get up.

150
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,130
<i>What people don't understand
is that Dukakis</i>

151
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:39,634
<i>does not have
the financial infrastructure,</i>

152
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,855
Well, the construction guys

153
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:53,066
say it will take about a week
to fix the roof.

154
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:56,278
Damned airline better not fuck us
on the shingle match.

155
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,949
- They still don't know?
- Know what?

156
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,873
- Where it came from?
- Oh, no. Apparently, they can't tell us
what happened yet.

157
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:10,503
Something about a matching
serial number that got burned.

158
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,258
I had to sign a form saying I
wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

159
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:19,513
So we are not supposed to tell anyone
what nobody knows?

160
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:25,520
Yeah. But you tell...
What's your doctor's name?

161
00:25:25,603 --> 00:25:31,194
- Dr Thurman, Dad.
- Yes. You tell Dr Thurman whatever you want.

162
00:25:32,277 --> 00:25:33,487
- Dad.
- What?

163
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:35,364
- Dad!
- Oh...!

164
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:43,499
What's that woman doing standing out
in the middle of the damn road?!

165
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,102
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.

166
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:19,498
Well what did she say to you?

167
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:30,135
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?

168
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:34,389
- Imaginary.
- Would you like to talk about this friend?

169
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:36,934
- Frank.
- Frank.

170
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:40,563
- What did Frank say?
- He said to follow him.

171
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:43,484
- Follow him? Where?
- Into the future.

172
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:46,154
And then what happens?

173
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:50,867
And then he said...

174
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:55,038
then he said that the world
was coming to an end.

175
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,959
Do you think
the world is coming to an end?

176
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:03,548
No.

177
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:07,887
That's stupid.

178
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:13,601
<i>For my entire life
l was a victim of my own fear.</i>

179
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:16,605
<i>Love,</i>

180
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:20,943
<i>l was feeding fear with food.</i>

181
00:27:25,282 --> 00:27:26,157
<i>Fear,</i>

182
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,959
<i>And finally, I looked in the mirror</i>

183
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:40,465
<i>Not just in the mirror,
l looked THROUGH the mirror,</i>

184
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:44,804
<i>ln that image,
l saw my ego reflection,</i>

185
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:51,310
<i>For two years,
l thought it was normal</i>

186
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:53,688
<i>for a 10-year-old to wet the bed,</i>

187
00:27:53,813 --> 00:27:55,858
Shh!

188
00:27:58,903 --> 00:28:01,907
<i>But the solution
was there all the time,</i>

189
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,576
<i>I'm not afraid any more!</i>

190
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,624
<i>All over America, people have
come together to join hands,</i>

191
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:17,590
<i>People who believe that human life
is absolutely too important,</i>

192
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:23,639
<i>too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear,</i>

193
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:27,476
Pay close attention,
You could miss something.

194
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,232
<i>Hello, My name is Jim Cunningham
And welcome to "Controlling Fear".</i>

195
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:38,724
"... and the prince
was led into a world

196
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:41,102
of strange and beautiful magic."

197
00:29:41,186 --> 00:29:42,354
Wow.

198
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,610
"The Last Unicorn"
by Samantha Darko.

199
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:51,072
- Give it back!
- "There was once a unicorn named Ariel..."

200
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:57,205
- You wrinkled it.
- It's not wrinkled, Sam. Just flatten it
in a book or something

201
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:00,708
It's almost 7.45. The bus should've
been here like 20 minutes ago.

202
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,753
Maybe Martha finally went nuts
and hijacked the bus.

203
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:07,299
You know there's like this rule -
at 7.45, we get to go home.

204
00:30:07,424 --> 00:30:09,175
There's no rule.

205
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:13,514
Cherita, you should... go home.

206
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:17,435
Yeah, if you're still here and the bus
comes, we'll all get into trouble.

207
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,688
- Shut up!
- "Shut up!"

208
00:30:19,772 --> 00:30:24,192
Hey, Porky Pig...
I hope you get molested.

209
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,197
Hey! Hey! I can't believe this!

210
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:33,287
My mom said the school's closed
today because it's flooded.

211
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,623
- No way!
- Yeah.

212
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:38,334
Holy shit!
That's the best news I've ever heard!

213
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,303
My God, is this ever going to stop?

214
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:53,393
Eventually, yes it will. But right now,
l got 12 classrooms full of water.

215
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,937
All coming
from a busted water main.

216
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,983
- What else?
- What else?

217
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,735
Principal Cole,
I'll show you what else.

218
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,660
That's unbelievable.
That's solid bronze, isn't it?

219
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,662
- Yep.
- How did this happen?

220
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,374
I heard a cat burglar broke in and
trashed everything

221
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,794
and the Mongrel
got his head cut off.

222
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:17,629
- Hah!
- True!

223
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,889
Beth's mom said the boys' locker
room flooded

224
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:29,225
and they found faeces everywhere.

225
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:31,561
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.

226
00:31:44,617 --> 00:31:45,619
Hey.

227
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:49,957
Has anyone ever told you
that you're sexy?

228
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,501
I like your boobs.

229
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,504
Hey.

230
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:57,299
Hey.

231
00:31:58,634 --> 00:32:00,385
School's cancelled.

232
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,598
Do you want to walk me home?

233
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,434
Sure.

234
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:18,114
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

235
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:21,409
Just... you should check your backpack.
Those guys steal shit.

236
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:23,329
Fuck 'em!

237
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,461
- So, why'd you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.

238
00:32:29,544 --> 00:32:32,881
My mom had to get a restraining order
against my stepdad.

239
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,883
He has emotional problems.

240
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,928
Oh! I have those, too.
What kind of emotional problems does your dad have?

241
00:32:38,637 --> 00:32:41,557
He stabbed my mom
four times in the chest.

242
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,604
Oh. Did he go to jail?

243
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:48,982
No, he fled.
They still can't find him.

244
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:52,111
But, my mom and I had to change our names.

245
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:54,906
I thought Gretchen Ross
was pretty cool.

246
00:32:55,198 --> 00:33:00,036
I was in jail once. I mean...
I burned down this house.

247
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,165
It was abandoned,
but still I got held back in school

248
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,918
and I can't drive till I'm 21.

249
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,714
But I'm over all of that.

250
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:11,800
I'm... painting and stuff.

251
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:16,264
Writing. I want to be a writer.
Maybe a painter. Maybe both...

252
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:19,600
I'll write a book
and draw the pictures.

253
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:23,855
Then maybe people will understand
me. I don't know, change things.

254
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:26,942
Donnie Darko - what the hell kind
of name is that?

255
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:29,654
It's like some sort of superhero or something.

256
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:33,826
What makes you think I'm not?

257
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:42,752
Look, I should go. For physics, Monnsnoff
is having me write this essay -

258
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:45,756
Greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind.

259
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:51,428
It's Monnitoff.
But that's easy. Antiseptics.

260
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:56,100
Like, the whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.

261
00:33:56,726 --> 00:34:01,147
Before antiseptics, there was no
sanitation, especially in medicine.

262
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:02,900
You mean soap?

263
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:12,411
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

264
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:14,080
Why is that?

265
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,958
Because you and i would have never have had
this conversation.

266
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:21,045
You're weird.

267
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:23,381
Sorry.

268
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:26,302
No, that was a compliment.

269
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:32,100
Well, look, uh...

270
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:37,021
You want to go with me?

271
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:43,738
- Where do you want to go?
- No, I mean, like, "go" with me.

272
00:34:44,155 --> 00:34:47,492
- That's what we call it here "going together".
- Sure.

273
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,333
Ok. Where are you going?

274
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:57,920
I'm going home.

275
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:05,847
Stupid...
"Where are you going?"

276
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:17,442
I'd like to try something new this time.

277
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:22,156
Have you ever been hypnotised?

278
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:24,743
No.

279
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,008
And when I clap my hands twice, you will
wake up. Do you understand?

280
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:44,098
- Yes.
- So, tell me about your week.

281
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,643
I met a girl.

282
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,315
What is her name?

283
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,359
Gretchen.

284
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,988
We're going together now.

285
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,660
Do you still think
about girls a lot?

286
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,954
Yeah.

287
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:13,214
- How are things going at school?
- I think about girls a lot.

288
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:16,009
I asked you about school, Donnie.

289
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:19,180
I think about fucking
a lot during school.

290
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:23,810
What else do you think about
during school?

291
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:26,647
"Married With Children".

292
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:30,485
- You think about your family?
- I just turn down the volume

293
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:32,987
and think about
fucking Christina Applegate.

294
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,615
I asked you about your family, Donnie.

295
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:37,367
No.

296
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:42,373
I don't think about fucking
my family. That's gross.

297
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,086
I'd like to hear
about your friend Frank.

298
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,857
Sam Bylan.

299
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:16,244
Cherita Chen.

300
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,976
Donald Darko.

301
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:01,755
Daye Dennis.

302
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:08,929
Hey, you fuck!

303
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:13,059
Did you tell'em that I flooded the school?

304
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:19,191
- I didn't say shit.
- Yeah, well, thats not what I heard. They think I did it.

305
00:38:19,274 --> 00:38:23,321
Yeah, well if you're innocent, then you have
nothing to worry about, right?

306
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:26,158
Fuck you! You know what I think?

307
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,911
I think you did it.

308
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,099
Beer and pussy - that's all I need.

309
00:38:48,432 --> 00:38:52,353
- So, we gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?

310
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:56,234
Mm-hm.
Not some like tight-ass Middlesex chick, you know.

311
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,027
Like, this cute little blonde

312
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,198
that'll get down with the guys
like Smurfette does.

313
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:04,076
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

314
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,999
That's bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs
Why do you think Papa Smurf made her?

315
00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:13,294
Because all the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

316
00:39:13,378 --> 00:39:15,755
No, no, no, not Vanity.
I heard he was a homosexual.

317
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,594
Ok, well you know what then she fucks them
while vanity watches. Ok?

318
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:23,432
What about Papa Smurf?
I mean he must get some in some of the action?

319
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:26,350
Yeah, what he does,
he films the gang-bang.

320
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:29,145
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

321
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,445
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't
create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

322
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:40,075
She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy
with the intention of destroying the Smurf village,

323
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:43,788
but the overwhelming goodness
of the Smurf way of life transformed her.

324
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:50,044
And as for the whole gang-bang
scenario, it just couldn't happen!

325
00:39:50,127 --> 00:39:53,340
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have

326
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:56,719
reproductive organs
under those little white pants.

327
00:39:58,304 --> 00:40:01,767
That's what's so illogical
you know, about being a Smurf.

328
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:06,396
What's the point of living
if you don't have a dick?

329
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:13,488
Damnit, Donnie, why do you gotta get
so smart on us?

330
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:16,992
Grandma Death.

331
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:19,578
Excuse me! Excuse me!

332
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:25,501
Please stay off the road, Miss Sparrow,
or I will call Social Services.

333
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:29,798
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch!

334
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:31,591
Yeah.

335
00:40:33,302 --> 00:40:36,181
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

336
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,018
She does the same thing every day.

337
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:44,022
Just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox.

338
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:49,779
Nothing ever in there.

339
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,950
Oh, wait, wait, wait...

340
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,874
She goes she's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.

341
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,211
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

342
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,505
This could be it. Oh...?

343
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,926
Oh, no dice, Grandma. Sorry.

344
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,136
Someone ought to write that bitch.

345
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:13,974
<i>Authorities continued their search</i>

346
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:17,811
<i>for a suspect in the Middlesex
Ridge School vandalism.</i>

347
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,564
<i>The private school
has asked for donations</i>

348
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:24,026
<i>to restore its beloved mascot,
known only as the Mongrel...</i>

349
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:35,706
It's very helpful.
There's a good turnout tonight.

350
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,795
What are you trying
to accomplish here?

351
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:43,548
There was urine and faeces
flooded in my office.

352
00:41:45,258 --> 00:41:47,053
Whatever fits.

353
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:50,724
"Whatever fits"?

354
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:54,478
In cooperation
with the county police,

355
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,731
we have begun
an active investigation

356
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,858
into the cause of the flooding.

357
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:03,071
And our suspects include
several of our own students...

358
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:07,159
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

359
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,674
Kitty, I would appreciate
if you would wait...

360
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,386
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher,

361
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,641
but I am also a parent
of a Middlesex child.

362
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:30,352
Therefore I am the only person here

363
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:33,606
who transcends
the parent-teacher bridge.

364
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:41,864
Don't worry, you got away with it.

365
00:42:41,948 --> 00:42:45,535
I have in my hand Graham Greene's
"The Destructors".

366
00:42:45,953 --> 00:42:50,458
This short story is part of my
daughter's English assignment.

367
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:53,795
In this story,
several children destroy

368
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:56,966
an elderly man's house
from inside out.

369
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,608
How can you do that?

370
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:21,743
And how do they do this?

371
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:26,416
They flood the house
by breaking through a water main.

372
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:30,504
I can do anything I want.

373
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:33,966
And so can you.

374
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,224
And I think that this garbage
should be removed!

375
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:43,769
Excuse me.
What is the real issue here?

376
00:43:43,852 --> 00:43:46,438
The PTA doesn't ban books.

377
00:43:46,522 --> 00:43:49,776
The PTA is here to acknowledge
that pornography

378
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:52,279
is being taught in our curriculum!

379
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:57,450
- It's meant to be ironic.
- Excuse me. You need to go back to grad school.

380
00:43:58,243 --> 00:44:01,372
Why did you make me
flood the school?

381
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:07,837
They are in great danger.

382
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:10,883
Kitty, do you even know
who Graham Greene is?

383
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,513
I think we have all seen "Bonanza".

384
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:21,687
Well, um... while we are
on other topics...

385
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:24,440
Where'd you come from?

386
00:44:25,775 --> 00:44:27,986
Do you believe in time travel?

387
00:44:30,947 --> 00:44:33,242
Who are you talking to?

388
00:44:37,496 --> 00:44:39,916
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

389
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,181
A storm is coming, Frank says.

390
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:57,102
A storm that will swallow
the children,

391
00:44:57,686 --> 00:45:01,315
And I will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.

392
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,694
I'll deliver the children
back to their doorsteps,

393
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:08,114
send the monsters
back to the underground.

394
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:12,328
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.

395
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:13,913
Except for me.

396
00:45:15,665 --> 00:45:18,501
Because I am Donnie Darko.

397
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,429
Who is Frank?

398
00:45:35,145 --> 00:45:37,397
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.

399
00:45:43,906 --> 00:45:45,574
<i>In these modern times,</i>

400
00:45:45,657 --> 00:45:50,288
<i>our attitude and beliefs
are so delicate, so fragile.</i>

401
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:55,543
<i>I have had a Cunning Vision,
This vision has released me.</i>

402
00:45:55,626 --> 00:45:58,547
<i>It's important that
our lifeline be rejuvenated,</i>

403
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,258
<i>so that we can breathe again.</i>

404
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,428
<i>It's time to breathe.</i>

405
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,598
<i>It is time to breathe.</i>

406
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,351
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

407
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,188
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>

408
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:17,026
<i>So now let us begin Lifeline
Exercise Number One,</i>

409
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,195
<i>Please press stop now.</i>

410
00:46:26,705 --> 00:46:31,668
As you can see, the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes.

411
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:34,129
Fear and love.

412
00:46:34,504 --> 00:46:38,050
Fear is in the negative
energy spectrum.

413
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:43,306
- Love is in the positive energy spectrum.
- No, duh!

414
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:48,145
Excuse me?
"No, duh" is a product of fear.

415
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:54,568
Now, on each card
is a character dilemma

416
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:57,196
which applies to the lifeline.

417
00:46:58,156 --> 00:47:02,703
Please... Take this.
Thank you.

418
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:06,583
Please read
each character dilemma aloud

419
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:10,962
and place an "X' on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

420
00:47:11,754 --> 00:47:13,256
Cherita?

421
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:25,312
"Juanita has
an important math test today.

422
00:47:25,396 --> 00:47:29,443
"She's known about the test for
several weeks, but has not studied.

423
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:32,820
"ln order to keep from failing her class,

424
00:47:32,903 --> 00:47:36,116
Juanita decides
that she will cheat on the math test."

425
00:47:39,995 --> 00:47:41,998
Good. Good. Very good.

426
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:43,875
Mr Darko.

427
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:55,263
"Ling Ling finds a wallet on the ground
filled with money.

428
00:47:55,346 --> 00:47:57,015
"She takes it to the address
on the driver's licence

429
00:47:57,098 --> 00:47:59,059
but keeps the money inside the wallet."

430
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:03,982
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.

431
00:48:04,065 --> 00:48:08,070
Just place an "X' on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

432
00:48:08,153 --> 00:48:13,576
No, I mean I know what to do, I just dont get this
You can't just lump things into two categories.
Things aren't that simple

433
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:16,537
The lifeline is divided that way.

434
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:20,458
Well, life isn't that simple.
I mean...

435
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:24,088
Who cares if Ling Ling returns the wallet
and keeps the money?

436
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:26,049
It has nothing to do
with either fear or love.

437
00:48:26,132 --> 00:48:28,967
Fear and love are the deepest
of human emotions.

438
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:32,013
Ok. But you're not listening to me.

439
00:48:32,097 --> 00:48:34,433
There are other things
that need to be take into account here,

440
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:37,478
Like, the whole spectrum
of human emotion.

441
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,647
You can't just lump everything

442
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,858
into these two categories
and deny everything else!

443
00:48:41,942 --> 00:48:45,904
If you don't complete
the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.

444
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:54,789
Donald,
let me preface this by saying

445
00:48:54,872 --> 00:48:59,961
that your Iowa Test scores
are... intimidating.

446
00:49:02,715 --> 00:49:03,842
So...

447
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:07,136
Let's go over this again.

448
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:10,056
What exactly
did you say to Miss Farmer?

449
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:14,853
I'll tell you what he said.
He asked me

450
00:49:14,937 --> 00:49:18,482
to forcibly insert the lifeline
exercise card into my anus!

451
00:49:35,085 --> 00:49:39,549
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

452
00:49:43,845 --> 00:49:47,223
Kitty... Excuse us, please.

453
00:49:52,396 --> 00:49:56,693
They've suspended him from after-
school activities for the next six months.

454
00:49:59,446 --> 00:50:03,076
Ever since this jet engine fiasco,
l honestly don't know what's gotten into...

455
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:07,538
Rose I'll tell you this because our daughters
have been on the dance team together

456
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:09,457
for two years
and I respect you as a woman,

457
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,085
but after witnessing
your sons behaviour this afternoon,

458
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:15,131
I have significant doubts
about your...

459
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,929
Our paths through life
must be righteous.

460
00:50:21,012 --> 00:50:23,390
i urge you to go home
and look in the mirror

461
00:50:23,473 --> 00:50:27,353
and pray that your son doesn't
succumb to the path of fear.

462
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:37,865
Do you remember
that weird gym teacher, Mrs Farmer?

463
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:43,622
Yeah. Ok, well, my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today.

464
00:50:44,204 --> 00:50:47,542
And then my parents
just bought him all this new shit.

465
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,173
Yeah, I know. I wish a jet engine
would fall on my room.

466
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,863
- Dr Monnitoff.
- Donnie.

467
00:51:14,323 --> 00:51:17,576
I know this is gonna
sound kind of weird,

468
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,705
but do you know anything
about... time travel?

469
00:51:25,793 --> 00:51:29,506
A wormhole
with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

470
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:34,554
which is theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man.

471
00:51:37,098 --> 00:51:39,393
So, according to Hawking,

472
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:42,855
a wormhole may be able
to provide a short cut

473
00:51:42,938 --> 00:51:46,401
for jumping between two distant
regions of space-time.

474
00:51:46,484 --> 00:51:49,529
So in order to travel back in time,
you have to have a big spaceship or something

475
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:51,782
that can travel
faster than the speed of light.

476
00:51:51,865 --> 00:51:55,036
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find one of these wormholes.

477
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,414
The basic principles of time travel
are there.

478
00:51:57,497 --> 00:52:01,626
You got your vessel and you portal.
Your vessel could be just about anything, most likely a spacecraft

479
00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:04,755
- Like a DeLorean?
- Metal craft of any kind.

480
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:10,512
You know, I love that movie.the way they shot it
It's so... like, futuristic, you know?

481
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:15,976
Listen, um... don't tell anybody
that I gave you this.

482
00:52:16,602 --> 00:52:19,105
Woman who wrote this
used to teach here.

483
00:52:19,189 --> 00:52:21,524
She was a nun many years
before that.

484
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:27,698
But... then overnight she just...
she became this entirely different person.

485
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:30,993
She up and left the church,
she wrote this book...

486
00:52:31,494 --> 00:52:35,040
She started teaching science,
right here at Middlesex.

487
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,836
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".

488
00:52:40,212 --> 00:52:42,172
Roberta Sparrow?

489
00:52:42,756 --> 00:52:44,091
That's right.

490
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:49,639
Roberta Sparrow?

491
00:53:09,496 --> 00:53:11,247
Roberta Sparrow.

492
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,835
Grandma Death.

493
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:37,695
It's called
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".

494
00:53:38,444 --> 00:53:42,533
- What does philosophy have to do
with time travel?
- Guess who wrote it.

495
00:53:42,616 --> 00:53:43,742
Who?

496
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,289
Roberta Sparrow.
Huh! She wrote a book.

497
00:53:49,207 --> 00:53:53,170
- Grandma Death wrote a book.
- That's a terrible nickname.

498
00:53:54,755 --> 00:53:57,342
We almost hit her with the car
the other day.

499
00:53:58,425 --> 00:54:02,597
She lives up there in that piece of crap
house, and you know she's loaded.

500
00:54:03,264 --> 00:54:07,395
- You're right. She used to be known
for her gem collection.

501
00:54:08,354 --> 00:54:11,441
Kids used to go up there
all the time

502
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:13,860
and try to steal stuff from her.

503
00:54:14,235 --> 00:54:16,655
She became a total recluse.

504
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:21,577
I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down the other day.

505
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:28,960
She was just standing there
in the middle of the road, frozen.

506
00:54:29,044 --> 00:54:32,089
So I got out of the car and
I walked over to see if she was OK.

507
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:36,678
And she leaned over
and whispered in my ear.

508
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:39,431
- What did she say?
- I mean, I think Frank wants me to go talk to her.

509
00:54:39,514 --> 00:54:43,978
Beacuse the last timeI saw him
he asked if I knew about time travel.

510
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:45,479
And she wrote a book about it,

511
00:54:45,563 --> 00:54:48,233
So that can't be like
a coincidence, right?

512
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,363
Donnie, what did Roberta Sparrow say to you?

513
00:54:55,865 --> 00:54:59,661
She said that every living creature
on earth dies alone.

514
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,752
How did that make you feel?

515
00:55:09,716 --> 00:55:12,134
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

516
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,850
She died when I was eight and she
crawled underneath the... the porch.

517
00:55:22,938 --> 00:55:24,065
To die.

518
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:29,488
To be alone.

519
00:55:30,698 --> 00:55:32,825
Do you feel alone right now?

520
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:39,916
I don't know...

521
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,255
I mean I'd like to believe I'm not,
but I just...

522
00:55:46,465 --> 00:55:51,387
I've just never seen any proof,
so I just don't debate it any more.

523
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:55,725
its like I could spend my whole life
debating it over and over

524
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:58,020
waying the pros and cons
and in the end I still wouldn't have proof,

525
00:55:58,145 --> 00:56:00,940
so I just don't debate it any more.

526
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,902
It's absurd.

527
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:09,617
The search for God is absurd?

528
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,705
It is if everyone dies alone.

529
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:17,876
Does that scare you?

530
00:56:20,922 --> 00:56:23,132
I don't want to be alone.

531
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:39,025
And so his tapes have made me realise

532
00:56:39,108 --> 00:56:43,614
that for the last 39 years, I have
been a prisoner of my own fear.

533
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,658
Fear.

534
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:50,414
Rose, you have got to meet
this Jim Cunningham.

535
00:56:51,122 --> 00:56:53,249
I can't believe he's single.

536
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:57,838
<i>It has been a disappointing night
for these Super Bowl champions.</i>

537
00:56:57,922 --> 00:57:01,634
<i>You're right, Dan, Coach Joe Gibbs
is on the sidelines.</i>

538
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,847
<i>He's gotta be thinking, "What
happened? What went wrong tonight?"</i>

539
00:57:07,642 --> 00:57:10,186
<i>- And here's the kick!</i>

540
00:57:10,686 --> 00:57:12,772
<i>It's no good...</i>

541
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:16,484
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- We need a miracle.

542
00:57:16,568 --> 00:57:18,862
We need to go for a safety.

543
00:57:20,447 --> 00:57:25,453
<i>What the future holds for this MVP,
we'll have to wait and see.</i>

544
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,005
You guys want anything?

545
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:39,594
<i>This week on "Who's The Boss?"
Samantha borrows Tony's van</i>

546
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:42,848
<i>and gets caught without a licence.</i>

547
00:57:43,474 --> 00:57:45,893
<i>Better make sure
we don't miss that one.</i>

548
00:57:48,146 --> 00:57:51,190
<i>Here we are again,
Fourth down now...</i>

549
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:36,185
Ok, lets not forget tomorrow,
we are meeting with our partners

550
00:59:36,269 --> 00:59:38,730
for the Young Inventors' Fair.

551
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:42,045
What happened to your neck?
You have blood on your neck.

552
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:47,264
I don't want to talk about it
So, what are we gonna invent

553
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:56,416
What if you could go back in time
and take all those hours of pain and darkness

554
00:59:56,499 --> 00:59:58,919
and replace them
with something better?

555
00:59:59,044 --> 01:00:02,799
- Like images or what?
- Yeah, like a Hawaiian sunset

556
01:00:02,924 --> 01:00:04,593
or the Grand Canyon.

557
01:00:04,676 --> 01:00:07,095
Things that remind you
how beautiful the world is...

558
01:00:07,178 --> 01:00:10,682
You know we've been going together
for like two weeks.

559
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:11,934
Yeah?

560
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,980
Well, I er... I...

561
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,819
You want to kiss me?

562
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:31,289
- I'm sorry, I...
- Look, Donnie, wait. I just...

563
01:00:31,373 --> 01:00:33,834
- Well, I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be

564
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:36,545
at a time when... it...

565
01:00:37,505 --> 01:00:41,218
- When what?
- When it reminds me just...

566
01:00:42,886 --> 01:00:46,264
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

567
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,058
Yeah.

568
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:52,187
And right now there's some fat guy
over there staring at us.

569
01:01:21,972 --> 01:01:24,516
I don't think telling any woman

570
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:27,478
to forcibly insert
an object up her anus

571
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:30,732
is something
that should go without consequence.

572
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:37,614
I think we should buy him a moped.

573
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,079
I think we should get a divorce.

574
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,930
- You are not going to tell Mom, are you?
- Why would I tell mom?

575
01:01:58,013 --> 01:02:00,891
- Coz, you tell Mom everything.
- No, I don't.

576
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:08,900
- Let me see it.
- No, it's not finished. It's...

577
01:02:08,983 --> 01:02:10,778
Ok. It's cool.

578
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:17,994
That's scary.

579
01:02:21,456 --> 01:02:22,665
You think?

580
01:02:25,085 --> 01:02:28,131
Thank you for seeing us
at such a late notice.

581
01:02:28,256 --> 01:02:32,135
We both felt that it was time for
us to come and discuss...

582
01:02:32,802 --> 01:02:35,514
What I think is going on
with your son.

583
01:02:35,598 --> 01:02:37,058
Yes.

584
01:02:37,433 --> 01:02:41,019
Um... Well, he's er...

585
01:02:43,022 --> 01:02:47,110
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

586
01:02:47,193 --> 01:02:48,612
for insulting his gym teacher.

587
01:02:48,737 --> 01:02:53,534
I'm not really sure that's a good example.
I think he had just cause.

588
01:02:53,617 --> 01:02:57,623
Rose, let me just lay out
what I believe is happening here.

589
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,336
Donnie's aggressive behaviour...

590
01:03:04,338 --> 01:03:08,092
his increased detachment
from reality,

591
01:03:09,344 --> 01:03:14,099
seem to stem from his inability to
cope with the forces in the world

592
01:03:14,183 --> 01:03:17,019
that he perceives
to be threatening.

593
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:24,861
Has he ever told you
about his friend Frank?

594
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:30,827
Frank?

595
01:03:31,244 --> 01:03:33,372
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.

596
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:36,583
The what?

597
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:45,885
I don't recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit.

598
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:47,429
Donnie is experiencing

599
01:03:47,512 --> 01:03:50,516
what is commonly called
a daylight hallucination.

600
01:04:04,823 --> 01:04:08,452
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

601
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:16,254
- What can we do?
- I would like to do more hypnotherapy...

602
01:04:18,464 --> 01:04:20,967
...and increase his medication.

603
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:33,147
Whatever will help him, really,
is... That's why we're here.

604
01:04:34,107 --> 01:04:38,027
We just would like him
to experience some relief.

605
01:04:39,613 --> 01:04:43,284
So if you think
that more medication will do that,

606
01:04:44,744 --> 01:04:47,915
then I think
we should give it a try.

607
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:58,176
It's complicated.

608
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:00,136
Yeah?

609
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:05,143
There's like a force you know in your brain
that just sends you someplace.

610
01:05:05,226 --> 01:05:07,812
Do you go someplace familiar?

611
01:05:07,896 --> 01:05:13,402
No, but each time I keep waking up
farther from my house.

612
01:05:15,738 --> 01:05:17,072
Scary.

613
01:05:29,503 --> 01:05:31,297
Donnie Darko.

614
01:05:35,135 --> 01:05:36,511
I know.

615
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:48,609
- Good morning, you mongrels!
- Good morning.

616
01:05:48,692 --> 01:05:51,695
Is that all the guster you can muster?
i said, Good morning!

617
01:05:51,779 --> 01:05:56,075
- Good morning!
- Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

618
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:59,036
But I can still sense some students out there

619
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,040
who are actually afraid
to say "good morning".

620
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,792
Good morning!

621
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:08,464
Yeah, that's what I like to hear!
Coz entirely, too many young men and women today

622
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:11,927
are completely paralysed
by their fears.

623
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:17,725
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

624
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:20,603
of drugs, alcohol
and premarital sex.

625
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:25,525
Now, I'm going to tell you
a little story today.

626
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,655
It's a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man

627
01:06:29,738 --> 01:06:33,951
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear,

628
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:38,457
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

629
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:41,753
His name was Frank.

630
01:06:52,347 --> 01:06:55,310
- We're moving through time.
- What?

631
01:06:58,313 --> 01:07:00,566
Hi. My stepsister, like,

632
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:03,027
I sometimes worry
that she eats too much.

633
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,655
- Shut up, Kim!
- I'm just trying to help you.

634
01:07:05,738 --> 01:07:07,199
Oh, sweetheart, sweetheart, please!

635
01:07:07,283 --> 01:07:09,994
There's absolutely no reason
to be embarrassed here.

636
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:14,832
Many times we eat because we are
afraid to face our ego reflection. Alright?

637
01:07:16,084 --> 01:07:18,586
We find ourselves
looking at the mirror,

638
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:22,299
rather than into
and through the mirror.

639
01:07:22,383 --> 01:07:26,763
When we do that, we can finally see
the reality of how beautiful we are.

640
01:07:27,388 --> 01:07:31,685
- Thanks! - Sure. Come on up here.
Don't be afraid.

641
01:07:36,231 --> 01:07:40,612
Er, how can I find out
what I wanna be when I grow up?

642
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:43,323
Oh! That's a hard one.

643
01:07:43,406 --> 01:07:48,162
Well, what i need you to do is look deep inside of yourself,
deep within your heart,

644
01:07:48,246 --> 01:07:54,919
and find what is in the world that makes you feel love,
pure, unconditional love. And go to that.

645
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:57,297
In your studies, in your athletics,

646
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:00,051
in your relationships,
go towards love.

647
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,554
- Thank you.
- Come on up.

648
01:08:05,932 --> 01:08:06,975
Next.

649
01:08:11,938 --> 01:08:16,360
- What do I do to learn how to fight?
- "What do I do to learn how to fight?"

650
01:08:16,861 --> 01:08:22,576
Son, violence is a product of fear.
Learn to truly love yourself -

651
01:08:23,536 --> 01:08:27,082
TRULY love yourself -
and the world will be yours.

652
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:30,000
- Ok.
- Get yourself up here!

653
01:08:30,084 --> 01:08:31,335
All right!

654
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:38,677
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

655
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:41,807
Um... How much are they paying you
to be here?

656
01:08:43,642 --> 01:08:45,185
Er... Excuse me?

657
01:08:47,354 --> 01:08:50,148
- What's your name, son?
- Gerald.

658
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:53,569
Well, Gerald,
l think you're afraid.

659
01:08:53,652 --> 01:08:55,863
Are you telling us this stuff
so we can buy your book?

660
01:08:55,947 --> 01:08:59,118
Because I gotta tell you if you are
that was some of the worst advice I ever heard.

661
01:08:59,576 --> 01:09:02,914
See how sad this is?
Want your sister to lose weight?

662
01:09:02,997 --> 01:09:06,585
Tell her to get off the couch, stop eating Twinkies
and maybe go out for field hockey.

663
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:09,837
You know what no one ever
knows what they want to be.

664
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:13,341
It takes a little while to find that out.
Right, Jim?

665
01:09:14,259 --> 01:09:15,594
And you...

666
01:09:16,429 --> 01:09:18,139
Yeah, you.

667
01:09:18,807 --> 01:09:21,685
Sick of some jerk shoving your head
down the toilet?

668
01:09:21,768 --> 01:09:23,813
Well, you know what maybe
you should lift some weights

669
01:09:23,896 --> 01:09:27,858
or take a karate lesson, and the next
time he tries to do it you kick him in the balls.

670
01:09:29,902 --> 01:09:35,033
Son... Do you see this? This is an anger
prisoner, a textbook example.

671
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:38,287
- Prisoner.
- Do you see the fear, people?

672
01:09:38,663 --> 01:09:41,082
This boy is scared to death.

673
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:44,753
Son, it breaks my heart
to say this,

674
01:09:44,836 --> 01:09:48,757
but I believe you're a very
troubled and confused young man.

675
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,677
i believe you are searching the answers
in all the wrong places.

676
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:54,222
You're right, actually.

677
01:09:54,305 --> 01:09:56,975
I am pretty troubled
and I'm pretty confused.

678
01:09:57,058 --> 01:10:00,813
And I'm afraid, really, really
afraid. Really afraid, but I... I...

679
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,942
I think you're
a fucking Antichrist.

680
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,751
It's amazing.
The man thinks he's telling the truth.

681
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:22,588
and everything he says
is just a fucking lie.

682
01:10:22,671 --> 01:10:24,590
Everything he says!

683
01:10:25,174 --> 01:10:29,178
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud...
Everything he does...

684
01:10:29,261 --> 01:10:31,264
Are you ok?

685
01:10:35,185 --> 01:10:37,396
Sit down. Calm down.

686
01:10:43,612 --> 01:10:45,864
You ever hear of Grandma Death?

687
01:10:46,822 --> 01:10:47,865
Who?

688
01:10:53,372 --> 01:10:56,877
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".
What is this?

689
01:10:58,253 --> 01:10:59,922
She wrote it.

690
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:12,185
I'm... I'm seeing stuff...

691
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,898
Like a lot of
really messed-up stuff.

692
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:19,527
And there's chapters in that book
that describes the stuff I've been seeing,

693
01:11:19,611 --> 01:11:22,197
and it can't just be a coincidence.

694
01:11:33,835 --> 01:11:36,672
She gotta be in here somewhere.
She never leaves this house.

695
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:38,549
Maybe she's asleep.

696
01:11:59,072 --> 01:12:00,575
Donnie, look.

697
01:12:11,086 --> 01:12:12,963
Send her a letter.

698
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,498
Each vessel travels
along a vector through space-time

699
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:46,834
along its centre of gravity.

700
01:12:47,252 --> 01:12:48,587
Like a spear.

701
01:12:50,589 --> 01:12:54,677
- I beg your pardon?
- Like a spear coming out of your chest.

702
01:12:55,178 --> 01:12:57,472
Um... Sure. Yeah.

703
01:12:57,889 --> 01:13:00,558
In order for the vessel
to travel through time,

704
01:13:00,641 --> 01:13:03,603
it's got to find a portal,
or in this case wormhole or...

705
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:05,564
Could these portals...?

706
01:13:06,023 --> 01:13:09,652
Could these portals
just appear anywhere, any time?

707
01:13:09,736 --> 01:13:11,947
I think that's highly unlikely.

708
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:15,993
No, I think what you're talking about is
an act of God.

709
01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:18,663
Well, if God controls time,
and all time's pre-decided.

710
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,708
I'm not following you.

711
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:24,877
Every living thing
follows along a set path.

712
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:29,466
And if you could see your path or channel,
then you could see into the future?

713
01:13:30,468 --> 01:13:32,929
That's also a form of time travel.

714
01:13:33,012 --> 01:13:35,724
Well, you're contradicting
yourself.

715
01:13:35,807 --> 01:13:38,185
If we were able
to see our destinies

716
01:13:38,268 --> 01:13:40,562
manifest themselves visually,

717
01:13:40,645 --> 01:13:44,316
then we would be given a choice
to betray our destinies.

718
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,861
And the mere fact
that this choice exists

719
01:13:46,944 --> 01:13:50,240
would make all preformed destiny
come to an end.

720
01:13:50,657 --> 01:13:53,870
Not if you travel
within God's channel.

721
01:13:57,749 --> 01:14:01,878
I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

722
01:14:04,297 --> 01:14:06,675
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

723
01:14:09,053 --> 01:14:10,304
Ok.

724
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:20,816
It gives me no pleasure to deny you

725
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:24,446
the right to read one of the great writers
of the 20th century.

726
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:29,202
But, alas, I have not yet been elected
queen of the universe,

727
01:14:29,285 --> 01:14:33,164
so I must obey the rules.
And so will you.

728
01:14:33,665 --> 01:14:37,460
So, anyone seen in this school
reading this book

729
01:14:38,002 --> 01:14:39,712
will be suspended.

730
01:14:39,796 --> 01:14:41,047
But, not to worry.

731
01:14:41,131 --> 01:14:45,720
Someone has already pre-ordered a dozen copies
at the Sarasota Mall bookstore.

732
01:14:48,223 --> 01:14:50,017
In Mr Greene's absence,

733
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:54,063
we will now be reading another
classic -"Watership Down" by Richard Adams.

734
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,445
Here, Donnie.

735
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:02,322
Pass these back.

736
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:07,662
Maybe you and Frank
can read this one together.

737
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:23,247
Now you know where he lives.

738
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:28,921
And they grow
out of our... chest, solar plexus?

739
01:16:29,212 --> 01:16:33,301
Just like she described in the book, the way
they moved and they smelled.

740
01:16:33,593 --> 01:16:35,510
It's like they're workers.

741
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:40,934
Assigned to each one of us.
They just... They're like liquid.

742
01:16:42,852 --> 01:16:47,066
I followed it
into my parents' bedroom.

743
01:16:47,901 --> 01:16:49,819
What did you find?

744
01:16:55,409 --> 01:16:57,119
Nothing.

745
01:16:59,455 --> 01:17:05,546
- So we call them IMGs.
- Infant Memory Generators.

746
01:17:05,879 --> 01:17:09,008
So the idea is that you buy these glasses
for your infant,

747
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:12,261
and they wear them
at night when they sleep.

748
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:15,681
But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs.

749
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:19,644
And each photograph is of something
peaceful or beautiful,

750
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:21,772
whatever the parents want to put inside.

751
01:17:21,855 --> 01:17:24,608
And what effect do you think that this would have
on an infant?

752
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,364
Well, the thing is nobody remembers
their infancy.

753
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,491
Anybody who says they do is lying.

754
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:33,660
So, we think this will help develop memory
earlier in life.

755
01:17:33,744 --> 01:17:34,745
Yeah.

756
01:17:34,829 --> 01:17:37,832
And did you stop and think
that maybe infants need darkness

757
01:17:37,915 --> 01:17:40,501
That maybe darkness is part of their natural
development?

758
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:46,175
No.

759
01:17:49,137 --> 01:17:50,096
Yeah.

760
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:55,352
What if the parents, like, put in pictures
of Satan or dead people, crap like that?

761
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:58,397
Is that what you'd show your kids?

762
01:17:59,607 --> 01:18:04,529
Er, well, I mean, didn't your dad,
like, stab your mom?

763
01:18:14,373 --> 01:18:15,541
Get out.

764
01:18:17,711 --> 01:18:18,921
Gretchen!

765
01:18:19,338 --> 01:18:23,092
Gretchen! Gretchen.
I'm sorry about those guys.

766
01:18:51,123 --> 01:18:54,252
- Two for "Evil Dead", please.
- That'll be $2.

767
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:44,686
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?

768
01:19:50,607 --> 01:19:53,653
Why are you wearing
that stupid man suit?

769
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:05,083
Take it off.

770
01:20:25,315 --> 01:20:27,567
What happened to your eye?

771
01:20:43,544 --> 01:20:45,753
Why do they call you Frank?

772
01:20:46,713 --> 01:20:49,216
It is the name of my father.

773
01:20:51,761 --> 01:20:54,055
And his father before me.

774
01:20:58,143 --> 01:20:59,520
Frank...

775
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:06,027
When's this going to stop?

776
01:21:06,402 --> 01:21:09,072
You should already know that.

777
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,994
I want you to watch the movie screen.

778
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:19,000
There's something
l want to show you.

779
01:21:27,009 --> 01:21:29,387
Have you ever seen a portal?

780
01:21:50,327 --> 01:21:52,330
Burn it to the ground.

781
01:23:06,664 --> 01:23:10,127
Ok. Now, girls,
l want you to concentrate.

782
01:23:10,502 --> 01:23:13,005
Failure is not an option.

783
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:18,303
And, Bethany, if you feel the need
to vomit up there, just swallow it.

784
01:23:18,804 --> 01:23:22,432
- Ok, Mom.
- Hey, you guys, good luck out there.

785
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:04,646
Now, that was really something.

786
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:07,942
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel".

787
01:24:08,026 --> 01:24:10,987
Now the moment
we've all been waiting for is here

788
01:24:11,071 --> 01:24:15,826
It is my very distinct pleasure to introduce
to you Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,

789
01:24:15,911 --> 01:24:19,956
Samantha Darko, Beth Farmer
and Joanie James.

790
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:22,417
They are Sparkle Motion.

791
01:27:15,572 --> 01:27:17,742
How long was I asleep for?

792
01:27:18,617 --> 01:27:20,286
Whole movie.

793
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:05,755
Well, look what the cat dragged in!

794
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,969
How you doing, Donnie?

795
01:28:17,226 --> 01:28:19,937
Your little sister
was broken-hearted

796
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:22,941
that you missed
her big show last night.

797
01:28:24,568 --> 01:28:26,111
- Dad?
- Hm?

798
01:28:27,237 --> 01:28:28,739
I'm crazy.

799
01:28:29,949 --> 01:28:32,242
You're not crazy.

800
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:35,705
I used to be crazy.

801
01:28:38,917 --> 01:28:40,794
But you're not crazy.

802
01:28:44,548 --> 01:28:46,134
- Look, you're my only son...
- I know...

803
01:28:46,218 --> 01:28:52,307
No, hold it. I know I'm not
the best communicator, but...

804
01:28:55,269 --> 01:29:00,566
...whatever happens to you.
Be honest, tell the truth,

805
01:29:01,943 --> 01:29:05,572
even if they do look at you
funny -they will.

806
01:29:05,657 --> 01:29:08,535
But what you gotta understand, son,

807
01:29:08,618 --> 01:29:12,038
is that almost all of those people
are full of shit.

808
01:29:18,379 --> 01:29:22,467
They're all part of this great
big conspiracy of bullshit.

809
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:27,723
And they're scared
of people like you.

810
01:29:29,099 --> 01:29:30,976
Because those bullshitters know

811
01:29:31,059 --> 01:29:33,938
that you're smarter
than all of them.

812
01:29:35,857 --> 01:29:38,776
You know what you say
to people like that? Hm?

813
01:29:41,947 --> 01:29:43,700
"Fuck you."

814
01:29:48,163 --> 01:29:51,958
<i>The blaze was extinguished
sometime after 8,00 last night.</i>

815
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:54,711
<i>Firefighters discovered
what has been referred to</i>

816
01:29:54,795 --> 01:29:57,006
<i>as a kiddie porn dungeon,</i>

817
01:29:57,507 --> 01:30:03,389
<i>Cunningham, who has become
a recent celebrity, was arrested...</i>

818
01:30:03,472 --> 01:30:07,018
- Oh, my God!

819
01:30:07,393 --> 01:30:11,188
<i>Arson has not been ruled out
as the cause of the fire,</i>

820
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:15,235
<i>Now a group
of Cunning Vision employees...</i>

821
01:30:15,318 --> 01:30:16,862
Dad played golf with that guy.

822
01:30:16,946 --> 01:30:19,156
<i>...vehemently denied
the alleged link</i>

823
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:22,285
<i>to a child pornography
publishing circuit.</i>

824
01:30:22,368 --> 01:30:26,331
<i>In a vicious statement, Connie
attacked fire department officials,</i>

825
01:30:26,456 --> 01:30:28,625
<i>claiming a mass conspiracy.</i>

826
01:30:33,214 --> 01:30:36,551
I'm sorry, Karen.
This is a progressive school,

827
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:40,806
But we don't feel the methods
you have undertaken here are appropriate.

828
01:30:41,891 --> 01:30:44,894
What exactly about my methods
are inappropriate?

829
01:30:51,651 --> 01:30:54,989
I am sorry that you have failed.

830
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,664
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l have another appointment.

831
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:06,585
You can finish out the week.

832
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,886
Fuck!

833
01:31:37,913 --> 01:31:40,749
Good afternoon.
It gives me great pleasure to announce

834
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:43,711
that the Middlesex Ridge School
dance team

835
01:31:43,794 --> 01:31:48,632
has been invited to perform on
"Star Search '88" in Los Angeles, California.

836
01:32:16,665 --> 01:32:21,295
<i>- I know now a terrible thing
is coming. - What do you mean?</i>

837
01:32:21,379 --> 01:32:27,927
<i>The field, the field,
it's covered with blood,</i>

838
01:32:28,887 --> 01:32:31,640
<i>Blood? Don't be silly.</i>

839
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:49,285
<i>All right, it's getting dark,
We should get back to the burrow.</i>

840
01:32:49,369 --> 01:32:54,124
<i>Back to the burrow? It'll come
there, it's all around us!</i>

841
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:57,544
<i>- Stop it, Fiver,
- We've got to leave here.</i>

842
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:09,099
When the other rabbits
hear of Fiver's vision,

843
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:10,518
Do they believe him?

844
01:33:10,601 --> 01:33:12,562
Why should we care?

845
01:33:13,939 --> 01:33:16,441
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

846
01:33:17,275 --> 01:33:19,361
Why should I mourn for a rabbit?
Like it was human.

847
01:33:19,653 --> 01:33:23,532
Are you saying that the death of one species
is less tragic than another?

848
01:33:23,783 --> 01:33:26,744
Of course. A rabbit's not like us.

849
01:33:26,994 --> 01:33:29,497
You know, it has no history books,
no photographs,

850
01:33:29,581 --> 01:33:31,875
no knowledge of sorrow or regret.

851
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:36,339
I'm sorry. Don't get me wrong,
You know l like rabbits.

852
01:33:36,422 --> 01:33:38,132
They're cute and horny.

853
01:33:38,217 --> 01:33:40,593
And if you're cute and horny,
You're probably happy.

854
01:33:40,678 --> 01:33:42,929
You don't know who you are
or why you're even alive.

855
01:33:43,012 --> 01:33:47,059
I mean, you just want to have sex as many
times as possible before you die.

856
01:33:47,935 --> 01:33:51,522
I just don't see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit...

857
01:33:52,315 --> 01:33:56,111
who never even feared death
to begin with.

858
01:33:57,113 --> 01:33:58,239
You're wrong.

859
01:33:58,322 --> 01:34:02,284
These rabbits can talk, they are the product
of the author's imagination.

860
01:34:02,368 --> 01:34:04,954
And he cares for them,
so we care for them,

861
01:34:05,037 --> 01:34:07,708
Otherwise we've just
missed the point.

862
01:34:10,794 --> 01:34:14,299
Aren't we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling?

863
01:34:15,842 --> 01:34:19,388
The deus ex machina?
The god machine?

864
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:23,643
That's what saved the rabbits.

865
01:34:30,567 --> 01:34:33,403
No, it was ridiculous.
I'll call you back.

866
01:34:35,614 --> 01:34:37,617
- Rose.
- Kitty.

867
01:34:39,535 --> 01:34:43,999
Rose, I'm sure you're aware of the horrible
allegations against Jim Cunningham.

868
01:34:44,082 --> 01:34:47,336
I know I saw it on TV. Something about
a kiddie porn dungeon...

869
01:34:47,419 --> 01:34:50,173
Oh, please, please!
Don't use those words!

870
01:34:51,549 --> 01:34:55,596
It's obviously some kind of conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

871
01:34:56,138 --> 01:35:00,434
And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead
the Jim Cunningham defence campaign.

872
01:35:02,645 --> 01:35:07,025
Rose, I have to appear at his
arraignment tomorrow morning.

873
01:35:07,109 --> 01:35:11,363
And as you know the girls are scheduled to leave
for Los Angeles in the morning.

874
01:35:11,446 --> 01:35:15,827
Now, as their coach, I was the obvious
choice to chaperone them on their trip.

875
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:19,122
- But now you can't go.
- Yes.

876
01:35:20,457 --> 01:35:23,293
Now, believe me,
of all the other mothers,

877
01:35:23,377 --> 01:35:25,671
I would never dream of asking you.

878
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:28,633
But none of the other mothers
are available to go.

879
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:35,349
I don't know, Kitty. It's a bad
weekend. Eddie's in New York.

880
01:35:36,559 --> 01:35:39,478
Rose, I don't know if you realise

881
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:43,483
what an opportunity
this is for our daughters!

882
01:35:44,234 --> 01:35:49,657
This has been a dream of Samantha's
and all of ours for a long time.

883
01:35:49,741 --> 01:35:52,327
I made her lead dancer!

884
01:35:53,537 --> 01:35:57,499
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion!

885
01:36:28,201 --> 01:36:30,787
Elizabeth will be in charge.

886
01:36:31,204 --> 01:36:33,707
She'll drive you to therapy.

887
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:36,000
And if you need anything,

888
01:36:36,084 --> 01:36:39,088
you promise me
that you will call Dr Thurman?

889
01:36:49,308 --> 01:36:52,896
How's it feel
to have a wacko for a son?

890
01:36:58,067 --> 01:36:59,903
It feels wonderful.

891
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:34,609
Here... I'm sorry! Here you are!

892
01:37:37,237 --> 01:37:40,366
- Hey, you guys are gonna win. I know it.
- So do I.

893
01:37:40,908 --> 01:37:45,580
Here's the keys. There's tons of food in the fridge
and I left money on the kitchen table And please do not...

894
01:37:45,664 --> 01:37:48,500
Mom, go.
You're gonna miss your plane.

895
01:37:48,584 --> 01:37:51,171
Mom, I need...

896
01:37:52,756 --> 01:37:55,508
There's nothing broken in my brain.

897
01:37:56,176 --> 01:37:58,762
- I know.
- Bye, Donnie.

898
01:38:03,851 --> 01:38:06,729
Ok, go. Go!

899
01:38:29,631 --> 01:38:31,174
Hello, Donnie.

900
01:38:31,966 --> 01:38:33,009
It's Friday.

901
01:38:33,093 --> 01:38:36,847
Shouldn't you be off with
your friends, scaring old people?

902
01:38:41,853 --> 01:38:45,816
- What's going on?
- I don't know. That's a good question.

903
01:38:47,902 --> 01:38:52,615
Suffice, to say I'm no longer your English teacher.
They fired me.

904
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:56,994
That's bullshit!
You're the only good teacher here.

905
01:39:00,207 --> 01:39:01,375
Thank you.

906
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,671
What's "cellar door"?

907
01:39:07,424 --> 01:39:09,760
This famous linguist once said

908
01:39:09,844 --> 01:39:13,472
that of all the phrases
in the English language,

909
01:39:13,555 --> 01:39:17,685
of all the endless combinations
of words in all of history,

910
01:39:17,768 --> 01:39:20,814
"cellar door"
is the most beautiful.

911
01:39:20,897 --> 01:39:22,774
"Cellar door."

912
01:39:56,980 --> 01:40:00,901
I promise that one day everything's
gonna be better for you.

913
01:40:03,237 --> 01:40:04,530
Chut up!

914
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:22,301
- I want to talk about your past today.
- No-

915
01:40:23,218 --> 01:40:26,180
I want to talk
about you and your parents.

916
01:40:27,723 --> 01:40:31,310
They didn't buy me
what I wanted for Christmas.

917
01:40:32,061 --> 01:40:34,856
What did you want for Christmas
that year?

918
01:40:35,816 --> 01:40:38,235
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

919
01:40:40,195 --> 01:40:44,326
How did you feel, being denied
these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

920
01:40:45,536 --> 01:40:49,038
- Regret.
- What else makes you feel regret?

921
01:40:52,292 --> 01:40:56,255
- That I did it again.
- You did it again?

922
01:40:58,133 --> 01:41:02,137
I flooded my school and I burned
down that pervert's house.

923
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:08,602
I only have a few days left
before they catch me.

924
01:41:08,685 --> 01:41:10,646
Did Frank tell you
to do these things?

925
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:14,568
I have to obey him.
He saved my life.

926
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:18,489
I have to obey him
or I'll be left all alone.

927
01:41:18,573 --> 01:41:20,408
And then...

928
01:41:21,493 --> 01:41:25,372
And then I won't be able to figure
out what this is all about.

929
01:41:25,831 --> 01:41:28,542
I won't be able to know his master plan.

930
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:33,715
Do you mean God's master plan?

931
01:41:33,798 --> 01:41:35,884
Do you now believe in God?

932
01:41:35,968 --> 01:41:38,971
I have the power
to build a time machine.

933
01:41:39,972 --> 01:41:41,891
How is that possible?

934
01:41:44,603 --> 01:41:47,563
How is time travel possible,
Donnie?

935
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:50,400
Time's up, Frank said.

936
01:41:50,776 --> 01:41:54,029
- When is this going to happen?
- Soon.

937
01:42:15,304 --> 01:42:17,472
What is going to happen?

938
01:42:21,478 --> 01:42:24,730
- Frank is gonna kill.
- Who is he going to kill?

939
01:42:29,611 --> 01:42:32,740
- Who is he going to kill, Donnie?
- I can see him right now!

940
01:42:37,913 --> 01:42:40,207
The sky's gonna open up.

941
01:42:46,714 --> 01:42:52,596
If the sky were to suddenly open up,
there would be no law, there would be no rule.

942
01:42:53,514 --> 01:42:56,893
There would only be you
and your memories,

943
01:42:57,393 --> 01:43:01,273
The choices you've made
and the people you've touched.

944
01:43:02,483 --> 01:43:07,488
If this world were to end,
there would only be you and him...

945
01:43:09,407 --> 01:43:11,325
...and no one else.

946
01:43:41,361 --> 01:43:44,029
You can stop
taking your medication.

947
01:43:44,113 --> 01:43:48,451
They're placebos.
Just pills made out of water.

948
01:43:50,287 --> 01:43:51,621
Thank you.

949
01:43:52,623 --> 01:43:54,083
Donnie...

950
01:43:56,210 --> 01:44:01,133
An atheist is someone who denies
altogether the existence of God.

951
01:44:01,507 --> 01:44:03,301
You're an agnostic.

952
01:44:04,093 --> 01:44:06,596
An agnostic is someone...

953
01:44:07,639 --> 01:44:11,269
who believes that there can be
no proof of the existence of God,

954
01:44:11,352 --> 01:44:16,316
but does not deny
a possibility that God exists.

955
01:44:24,075 --> 01:44:26,285
Goodbye, Dr Thurman.

956
01:44:49,395 --> 01:44:50,438
Hey.

957
01:44:52,023 --> 01:44:53,316
I got in.

958
01:44:57,947 --> 01:44:59,615
I am going to Harvard.

959
01:45:01,784 --> 01:45:05,330
Hey, we should totally throw
a party. I mean Mom and Dad are gone.

960
01:45:05,413 --> 01:45:08,709
It's Halloween Carnival.
We could totally get away with it.

961
01:45:08,793 --> 01:45:12,297
Ok. But it has to be small, right?

962
01:45:45,042 --> 01:45:48,546
We got eggs, water balloons
and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.

963
01:45:48,629 --> 01:45:50,840
I stole four beers from my dad.

964
01:45:50,924 --> 01:45:54,303
- We got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.

965
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:20,248
Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.

966
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:24,504
It is extremely important that you call me
as soon as you get this message.

967
01:46:24,587 --> 01:46:25,797
Thank you.

968
01:46:50,909 --> 01:46:51,952
You ok?

969
01:46:54,205 --> 01:46:56,165
Yeah. My mom's gone.

970
01:46:58,333 --> 01:46:59,877
You want to come in?

971
01:47:23,821 --> 01:47:25,740
I don't know.

972
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:29,995
She didn't leave a note
and the house was all messed up.

973
01:47:31,455 --> 01:47:33,333
But you're ok.

974
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:38,212
Did you call the cops?

975
01:47:39,255 --> 01:47:41,007
Yeah, they said
l should leave the house

976
01:47:41,091 --> 01:47:44,845
and that I should go
to a safe place.

977
01:47:46,931 --> 01:47:51,311
I'm just so scared. I keep thinking
something awful is happening and...

978
01:47:53,522 --> 01:47:56,065
It's my fucking stepdad, I know it.

979
01:48:06,036 --> 01:48:10,041
I guess some people are just born
with tragedy in their blood.

980
01:48:14,963 --> 01:48:18,800
- Hey, have you guys seen Frank?
- No, I think they said they were going on a beer run.

981
01:48:22,805 --> 01:48:26,559
If you're there, please pick up.
Oh, well, Good news,

982
01:48:26,643 --> 01:48:29,104
The girls got
three and a half stars

983
01:48:29,187 --> 01:48:31,732
and they get to comeback for the quarter-finals.

984
01:48:31,815 --> 01:48:34,818
Samantha was amazing, Anyway...

985
01:48:34,902 --> 01:48:37,488
We're gonna take the red-eye back
tonight and...

986
01:48:37,571 --> 01:48:40,449
- Mom, the plane's about to leave.
- Yeah. Ok.

987
01:48:40,534 --> 01:48:43,495
We'll take the red-eye back tonight,
we should arrive around 8:30 in the morning.

988
01:48:44,372 --> 01:48:48,376
Um... I hope everything's...
I hope everything's all right.

989
01:48:48,876 --> 01:48:50,504
I love you. Bye.

990
01:50:53,434 --> 01:50:55,854
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

991
01:50:56,187 --> 01:50:58,941
- Donnie?
- Look, we gotta go.

992
01:51:00,109 --> 01:51:03,446
- We have to see Grandma Death.
- Why? Is it about the book?

993
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:05,198
- No, it's Frank.
- Donnie...

994
01:51:05,281 --> 01:51:07,492
Time is running out! We gotta go.

995
01:51:53,795 --> 01:51:56,923
Donnie, nobody's here.
Let's just forget about it.

996
01:51:58,801 --> 01:52:00,720
"Cellar door."

997
01:52:00,803 --> 01:52:02,096
What?

998
01:53:04,667 --> 01:53:06,293
Donnie! Donnie!

999
01:53:10,256 --> 01:53:11,466
Donnie!

1000
01:53:12,509 --> 01:53:15,847
- Why the fuck are you here?
- Hey! Oh, my God!

1001
01:53:20,018 --> 01:53:21,854
- You're dead!
- What do we do?

1002
01:53:21,937 --> 01:53:24,021
- Oh! Shit!
- Leave them alone!

1003
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:30,697
Don't fucking move! Don't fucking move!
What did I say?

1004
01:53:39,457 --> 01:53:40,958
There's a car!

1005
01:53:42,669 --> 01:53:45,171
- Get the hell out of here, now!
- Come on!

1006
01:53:46,172 --> 01:53:48,508
Seth, there's a car coming. Let's go!

1007
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:51,011
I have a bigger knife now.

1008
01:53:52,262 --> 01:53:53,305
Fuck!

1009
01:54:00,647 --> 01:54:02,983
Did you call the fucking cops?

1010
01:54:03,066 --> 01:54:05,736
- Deus ex machina.
- What did you just say?

1011
01:54:07,822 --> 01:54:11,118
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Our saviour.

1012
01:54:15,665 --> 01:54:16,499
Donnie!

1013
01:54:47,575 --> 01:54:48,911
Frank...

1014
01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:16,067
Is she dead?

1015
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:28,706
What were you guys doing in the middle of the road?!
What were you thinking?

1016
01:55:36,423 --> 01:55:37,549
Go home!

1017
01:55:38,843 --> 01:55:41,637
Go home and tell your parents
everything's gonne be ok.

1018
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:44,515
Go!

1019
01:56:12,255 --> 01:56:17,762
The storm is coming.
You must hurry.

1020
01:58:51,395 --> 01:58:53,647
I'm going home.

1021
02:01:00,083 --> 02:01:04,129
Dear Roberta Sparrow,
I've reached the end of your book

1022
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:07,675
and there's so many things
l need to ask you.

1023
02:01:08,551 --> 02:01:11,720
Sometimes I'm afraid
of what you might tell me.

1024
02:01:15,642 --> 02:01:17,686
Sometimes I'm afraid
that you'll tell me

1025
02:01:17,769 --> 02:01:20,189
that this is not a work of fiction.

1026
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:25,362
I can only hope that the answers
will come to me in my sleep.

1027
02:01:26,614 --> 02:01:29,282
I hope that when the world comes to an end

1028
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:32,452
I can breathe a sigh of relief

1029
02:01:32,535 --> 02:01:36,207
because there will be
so much to look forward to.

1030
02:06:22,323 --> 02:06:24,826
Hey. What's going on?

1031
02:06:26,746 --> 02:06:31,084
Horrible accident.
My neighbour... got killed.

1032
02:06:32,711 --> 02:06:36,257
- What happened?
- Got smushed by a jet engine.

1033
02:06:42,805 --> 02:06:44,473
What was his name?

1034
02:06:45,016 --> 02:06:47,228
Donnie. Donnie Darko.

1035
02:06:50,147 --> 02:06:52,525
I feel bad for his family.

1036
02:06:53,235 --> 02:06:54,695
Yeah.

1037
02:07:02,077 --> 02:07:04,037
Did you know him?

1038
02:07:07,250 --> 02:07:09,085
No.
