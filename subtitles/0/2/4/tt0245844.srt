1
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,851
Idiots.

2
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:57,689
Take the captain beyond the reef
till we get permission
to bring him ashore.

3
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,624
For a moment I thought
you were abandoning me.

4
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:07,105
Fernand Mondego does not
abandon his friends in the face
of stupid, suicidal danger.

5
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:11,907
However, as Monsieur Morell's
official representative
on this voyage, Edmond,

6
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:15,038
I must officially tell you
you have overstepped
your bounds as second mate.

7
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:17,777
Officially. There.
I've covered myself.

8
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,479
If we don't get him to
a doctor, he will die.
Do you understand?

9
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,489
Of course I understand.
Just don't expect me
to do this sober.

10
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,491
- [Horse Whinnies]
- Right.

11
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:28,824
[Fernand]
English dragoons.

12
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:30,658
Hello!

13
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:35,000
Dantes, don't.

14
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:37,867
[Whinnying]

15
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,997
- A little careless,
don't you think?
- We have to talk to someone.

16
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:42,633
Well, I know, but...

17
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,074
We're French sailors!

18
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,612
- We seek medical attention!
- Come on. Come on.

19
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:50,245
- We come in peace.
- Come on.

20
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,544
We mean no harm!

21
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,553
Edmond!

22
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:02,392
Come on! Climb!

23
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,531
Look out!

24
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:39,725
Fernand!

25
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:48,240
Good. You finally
hit something.

26
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,871
Lieutenant Graypool.

27
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,577
If your thirst for gore demands
the death of these poor fools,

28
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,813
then by all means
shoot them.

29
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:03,879
But do so with the knowledge
they are no agents of mine.

30
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,118
Now explain yourselves
or be shot.

31
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:09,855
Sir, I am Edmond Dantes,

32
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,627
second mate of the merchant ship
Pharaon, on our way home to Marseilles.

33
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,763
This is the shipowner's representative,
Monsieur Fernand Mondego,

34
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,500
son of the Count Mondego.

35
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:25,136
Our captain has
contracted brain fever,
so we put in here for help.

36
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:32,980
If his coma is genuine,
he won't feel my knife point,
will he?

37
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:38,320
Only a scratch.

38
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,264
[Flesh Cutting]

39
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,258
Edmond!

40
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,826
- Lieutenant Graypool!
- We came to you in good faith!

41
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:55,466
- That's for my wounded men.
- And wounded pride, no doubt.

42
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:07,212
It has been an eventful evening.

43
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:21,296
If I hadn't have shot those
dragoons, you might by lying in
pieces on the beach right now.

44
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:25,702
- I almost got us killed.
- Yes, you did.

45
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:29,071
Yet... we survive.

46
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:32,339
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

47
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,346
- Whoo-hoo!
- [Laughs]

48
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:38,851
Donne-moi encore
une bouteille du vin

49
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:41,148
King's to you, Mondego.

50
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:44,816
Being your friend
is always an adventure. [Laughs]

51
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:48,327
- Yes, it is, isn't it?
- [Laughs]

52
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,659
It's a pity adventurers can't always
be friends though, huh?

53
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,254
What?

54
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:55,597
Well, it won't always
be like this, will it?

55
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,935
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Drink up.

56
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:03,908
We're drinking
Napoleon Bonaparte's wine.

57
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,844
[Napoleon] I think you'll find
the 1806 the finer vintage.

58
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:10,815
As long as you're still awake,
Monsieur Dantes, I wonder...

59
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:13,250
if I might have
a word with you.

60
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:19,889
I'm curious. What's the significance
of the chess piece?

61
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:24,029
It's just something
we've done since childhood.

62
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:28,397
Whenever one of us has had a victory,
king of the moment.

63
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,698
- King of the moment?
- Yes.

64
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,673
[Chuckles] In life, we're all
either kings or pawns.

65
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:40,111
I'm moved by your effort to save
your captain's life, Dantes.

66
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,616
He is my captain...
and my friend, Your Majesty.

67
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,049
Loyal friends
are rare indeed.

68
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,714
In fact, it is upon such
a matter I wish to speak.

69
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:53,953
I have written a rather
sentimental letter to an
old comrade in Marseilles.

70
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:56,621
It's a side of me I prefer
the British not see.

71
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,688
Since they have a habit
of opening my mail,

72
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:03,600
I wonder if you would
deliver it for me.

73
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,831
Oh, l-I don't...

74
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:08,840
It's just a letter
from one old soldier to another.

75
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,775
It's totally innocent,
I assure you.

76
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:15,303
But more important,
it is the price I demand
for the use of my physician.

77
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,243
Then I agree.

78
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,255
Good.

79
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:26,520
You are to deliver the letter
to Monsieur Clarion.

80
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:30,859
- Can you remember that name?
- Monsieur Clarion.
How will I find him?

81
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,865
Oh, he will find you.

82
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:37,699
Now, I do not wish
this letter's existence
to be known to anyone else.

83
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:41,070
Not even your boon companion back there.
Do you understand?

84
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,473
I'm a man of my word,
Your Majesty.

85
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:47,274
Yes, I, uh...
I believe you are.

86
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,663
What did he want?

87
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:09,794
Oh, um, news from France.
That's all.

88
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:33,348
Time you were on your way.
Your captain has been dead
for half an hour.

89
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,364
Are you sure?

90
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:43,061
When you have walked
as many battlefields as I,
young Dantes,

91
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:45,070
you can feel death.

92
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:53,278
Kings and pawns, Marchand.

93
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:57,783
Emperors... and fools.

94
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,931
[Chattering]

95
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:16,264
[Man]
Come about!

96
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,810
Drive faster.

97
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,487
[Bell Chiming]

98
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,290
Danglars, what's happened?

99
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:45,763
Captain Reynaud is dead, sir,

100
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,232
and Edmond Dantes
disobeyed my orders.

101
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:52,135
Come to my office
and report, Danglars.

102
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:56,071
- And you, Edmond.
- Will you be needing me,
Monsieur Morell?

103
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,302
Go.

104
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,142
Mercedes.

105
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:09,154
- Where is he? Where is Edmond?
- How lovely to see you too.

106
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,417
You just missed him,
I'm afraid.

107
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:14,085
Could be a while.
I think he's in trouble.

108
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,185
He said he'd meet us
by the rock. Come on.

109
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,287
I told Dantes
not to go ashore.

110
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:20,628
Is this true?

111
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,100
I accept
all responsibility.

112
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,627
As well you should.
It was all his idea, monsieur.

113
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:30,472
It should have
been your idea.

114
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,979
Puttin' into Elba didn't save
the captain's life, monsieur.

115
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:37,210
- I was protectin'the merchandise.
- You were protecting yourself...

116
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:41,083
by hiding behind your rank
and staying aboard.

117
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:46,683
Edmond Dantes, I am making you
the new captain of the Pharaon.

118
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:52,894
You presume to demote me?

119
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,900
There is no demotion.

120
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:59,064
You will remain first mate
under Captain Dantes.

121
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:02,505
Unless, of course, you choose
to seek another berth.

122
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,180
Now I imagine there's
a certain young lady...

123
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:19,554
who will want
to hear this news.

124
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:26,029
- [Chuckles]
- Thank you.

125
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:36,374
Monsieur Morell?

126
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:41,880
- I understand you had a ship just
returned from Elba, monsieur.
- Yes.

127
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:46,681
Did anyone aboard
get ashore there by any chance?

128
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:50,348
They did, but they're
not here at the moment.

129
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:53,517
Thank you, monsieur.

130
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,255
- May I say who has called upon them?
- Clarion.

131
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,093
The name is Clarion.

132
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:08,633
- Make love to me.
- Will you ever give up?

133
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,199
- He doesn't have to know.
- I'd know.

134
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,677
So would I.

135
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:17,546
- It'd be our little secret.
- I don't believe in secrets.

136
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:22,452
You think Edmond doesn't have secrets?
He does. Ask him.

137
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,787
- I know what you want, Fernand.
- You do?

138
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:30,591
Remember when we were kids and
Edmond got that whistle for his
birthday, and you got a pony?

139
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:34,463
You were so mad Edmond
was happier with his whistle
than you were with your pony.

140
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:38,300
I'm not going to be
your next whistle.

141
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,166
How long do you think
it's going to be before
he can afford a wife?

142
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:48,304
Two years.
Two years. That's all.

143
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:51,373
Then he gets his captain's
papers, and we can marry.

144
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:55,444
Two years. I couldn't wait
two years for anything,

145
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:57,751
particularly
a bride like you.

146
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,915
Hey!

147
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,154
- [Mercedes] There he is.
- Hey!

148
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,424
- [Laughs] Whoo!
- Mercedes!

149
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:14,670
[Mercedes]
I missed you so.

150
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,106
The missing is over now.

151
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:21,135
- Are you in trouble?
- No. I'm captain. Come on.

152
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:28,448
Monsieur Morell
gave me the Pharaon.

153
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:31,115
Edmond!

154
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,283
King's to me.

155
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:38,387
[Chuckles] Yours is a life
truly blessed, Edmond.

[Clicks Tongue]

157
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:45,065
Come on.

158
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,301
- You're still the best man.
- I know.

159
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,467
Come on!

160
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:22,238
Stop that.
You'll go bald.

161
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,440
Do you keep secrets from me?

162
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:34,509
Secrets? No.

00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,521
Why?

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,255
Ask me anything
and I'll tell you.

165

We don't have to wait
two years anymore.

166

- As soon as I can afford
the ring, we'll wed...
- I don't need a ring. I don't.

167
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,750
This will be my ring.

168
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:09,845
And no matter what happens,

169
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:14,256
you will never see it
off my finger.

Hello, my fine young gentleman.

172
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,668
Care to join me?

173
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,412
So tell me, Mondego,

174
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:45,853
how did you ever
become friends...

175
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:49,122
with that righteous little ponce,
Edmond Dantes?

176
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,094
He claims to be my friend,

177
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,827
yet he has the audacity
to keep secrets from me.

178
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:01,270
What secrets?

179
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,480
[Tapping]

180
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:22,050
To the new captain
of the Pharaon.

181
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,288
All I am I owe
to you, Father.

182
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:32,537
May this happy moment
be but the dawn...

183
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:37,474
of a long and wonderful life
for you both.

[Door Opens]

- Which of you is Edmond Dantes?
- I am.

186
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:47,379
Edmond Dantes,
you are under arrest by order
of the magistrate of Marseilles.

187
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,683
- Arrest?
- On what charges?

188
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:52,519
That information is
privileged. Take him.

189
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:57,085
I demand an explanation.
I demand an explanation!

190
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:01,259
I'll be back tonight.
Don't worry, Father. This is a mistake.

191
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,564
Mon Dieu.

192
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:18,778
Well, I must say, Dantes,
you don't have the look of a traitor.

193
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,179
Traitor?

194
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:25,781
Now, attend me well, Dantes,
for your life may depend on it.

195
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:29,385
Did you have any personal
contact with Napoleon
when you were on Elba?

196
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,692
Elba, yes, I did.
Well, we did.

197
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:36,531
I was with the
Count Mondego's son, Fernand,
almost the entire time.

198
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:39,935
- Do you know Fernand?
- He's a recent acquaintance, yes.

199
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:44,101
Oh, there you are.
He'll vouch for me.

200
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:46,736
No doubt, but you said,
"almost the entire time."

201
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:54,952
Except for when Napoleon asked
me to deliver a personal letter
to a friend in Marseilles.

202
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,047
Well, Dantes, it is for
accepting that treasonous
correspondence...

203
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,959
that you have been denounced
by your own first mate,
a Monsieur Danglars.

204
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:05,792
- What?
- Did you deliver the letter?

205
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,561
No, sir, someone was
supposed to find me.

206
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:11,762
It's... It's still
in my jacket. Here.

207
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,190
- Have you read this?
- No, sir, I can't read.

208
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:40,164
Well, Dantes,
this is a letter to one
of Napoleon's agents.

209
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:44,999
It gives the times and
the locations of the British
beach patrols on Elba.

210
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,767
Sir, I swear on my mother's
grave, I had no idea.

211
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,809
He swore its contents
were innocent.

212
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:02,980
No, it's you
that's innocent.

213
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:05,649
Foolish and innocent.

214
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:09,353
I believe these are
the worst charges that could
be leveled against you.

215
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:15,025
Fortunately, as I've
intercepted this document,
there's no harm done.

216
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,467
God knows how
you're going to survive in
this world, Edmond Dantes.

217
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,472
But you are no traitor.

218
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,134
You may go.

219
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,604
Thank you, sir.

220
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:36,344
Wait, uh, did Napoleon
tell you who's supposed
to pick up the letter?

221
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,583
Monsieur Clarion.

222
00:19:38,657 --> 00:19:40,648
What name did you say?

223
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,762
Monsieur Clarion.

224
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,395
Have you mentioned
this name to anyone else?

225
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,697
Monsieur Mondego
or anyone?

226
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:55,968
No, sir, in fact,
Monsieur Mondego knows
nothing of this letter.

227
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:05,883
This is very
dangerous information.

228
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,920
One can never be too careful
in times like this.

229
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:12,048
- Don't you think?
- Yes, sir.

230
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:14,524
Mm-hmm.

231
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:18,120
I've given you rather
a stressful time.

232
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:21,997
I wonder if, by way of an
apology, I could offer you
my carriage home.

- Monsieur?
- It's all right.
He's right here. Fernand!

248
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,518
I've been arrested for treason.
I barely managed to escape.

249
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:24,215
When we were on Elba,
Napoleon gave me a letter.

250
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,917
I didn't tell you because
he made me promise not to.

251
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,926
He said it was just
some note to an old friend.

252
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,519
But the bastard lied to me!
He lied.

253
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:34,157
It was to one of his agents.

254
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,134
Somehow the authorities found out.
I don't know what to do.

255
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:39,193
There's gendarmes on
horseback right behind me.

256
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:42,434
All right.
We just have to think.

257
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:44,442
I hope I haven't
compromised you.

258
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,535
I was hoping your father
could help me.

259
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:48,910
He's in Paris.
He's very ill.

- How far back are the gendarmes?
- Minutes.

- Do you need money?
- Yes, thank you.

Stop it, Fernand.
I don't have time for this.

265
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:09,626
I saw Napoleon
give you that letter.

266
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:12,535
It was you?

267
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:15,300
Well, it wasn't just me.
It was Danglars's idea.

Why didn't you
come to me first?

Why did you keep it a secret from me?
I thought you were my friend.

00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,575
I told you I gave Napoleon my word.
He lied to me!

What's he done now?

Now, you listen to me, Father.
I am the chief magistrate,
an official of the new regime.

298
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,205
I cannot afford to have

In the end, treason
is a matter of dates.

I shall be the patriot,
and you the traitor,
when the emperor returns.

Stop it. Stop it,

Those days are over.
Napoleon Bonaparte is no longer
the emperor of anything.

If you continue
to dabble in this lunacy,
you run an excellent chance...

of being arrested and ruining

is that as a family
our fates are intertwined.

309
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:42,813
- Surely you can see that.
- See? Ah!

310
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:45,782
I'm an old ruin.

311

Welcome, Monsieur Dantes.

317
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:03,892
I am Armand Dorleac,
the warden of Chateau d'lf.

318
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:09,059
Monsieur, I know you must
hear this a great deal,

319
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:13,662
- but I assure you I am innocent.
- [Scoffs]

320
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,367
Everyone must say that,
I know, but I truly am.

321
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:19,171
- Innocent.
- Yes.

322
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:22,213
I know. I really do know.

323
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:27,714
- You mock me?
- No, my dear Dantes.

324
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:33,053
I know perfectly well
that you are innocent.
Why else would you be here?

325
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:36,652
- [Liquid Pouring]
- If you were truly guilty,

326
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:41,256
there are a hundred prisons in France
where they would lock you away,

327
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:46,737
but Chateau d'lf is where they
put the ones they're ashamed of.

328
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,211
Let's have a look at
your quarters now, shall we?

329
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:13,661
"God will give me justice."

330
00:29:13,732 --> 00:29:17,190
People are always trying
to motivate themselves.

331
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:22,400
Or they keep calendars,
but soon they lose interest
or they die.

332
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:26,501
- There's a window.
- All I'm left with is a rather
unsightly wall, I'm afraid.

333
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:31,072
So I conceived of another way to help
our prisoners keep track of time.

334
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:34,118
Every year, on the anniversary
of their imprisonment,

335
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:36,279
we hurt them.

336
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,016
Usually just
a simple beating really.

337
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:43,994
Although, on their first day here,
in your case, today,

338
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:46,462
I like to do
something rather special.

339

[Gasping]

00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:55,634
"Why me, O God?"

342
00:29:55,707 --> 00:30:00,576
- The answer is,
God has nothing to do with it.
- All right?

343
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:03,978
In fact, God is never
in France this time of year.

344
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:09,316
God has everything to do with it.
He's everywhere. He sees everything.

345
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,956
All right.

346
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:17,094
Let's make a bargain,
shall we?

347
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:22,862
You ask God for help,
and I'll stop the moment he shows up.

Monsieur Villefort,
have you not heard?

351
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:44,281
- Napoleon has escaped from Elba!
- What?

352

Landed 100 miles from here.
He marches on Paris!

353

Pack all my files.
And tell that idiot clerk
to find the ledger!

354
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,866
We are here to plead the case
of Edmond Dantes, Magistrate.

355
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:01,599
Not now! Dantes?

356
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:07,111
We have not met, monsieur.
I am Fernand Mondego,
the son of Count Mondego.

357
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,307
I am here to swear
to Edmond Dantes's innocence.

358
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:15,581
This is his employer,
Monsieur Morell, his father,
and his fiancee, Mercedes.

359
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:22,388
Edmond Dantes is charged
with high treason.

360
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,928
- Yet you stand by him?
- Of course I do.

361
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,932
What if I was to tell you
that Dantes is also
charged with murder?

362
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:36,838
- Murder?
- Edmond would never do such a thing.

363
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,809
Dantes carried a letter from
Napoleon to one of his agents.

364
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:41,812
When we tried to arrest him,
he killed one of my men.

365
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,644
No, if you knew him,
monsieur, you would know
that was not possible.

366
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,650
Have mercy, please.

367
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:49,243
You have proof
of this treason?

368
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:51,255
That is government business.

369
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:55,259
Please. Please,
just tell us where he is.

370
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:58,558
I cannot, mademoiselle.
He was handed over to the king's men.

371
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,827
I can understand your pain
at this betrayal.

372
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,997
But my advice to all of you
would be to forget Edmond Dantes,

373
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:09,063
particularly you,
mademoiselle.

Take solace in the comfort
of your good friend here...

00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:17,939
and perhaps some good may yet come
of this unhappy affair.

376
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:20,951
Now, you will excuse me.
I have to attend some other matters.

00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:22,350
My son is no traitor!

[Fernand]
I will try to reason with him.

379
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:27,989
- Let's leave this to Fernand.
He can plead the case.
- It's impossible. Never.

380
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:30,550
I will not give up
on Edmond yet.

381
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,359
I will never
forget your kindness.

And I shall never
cease to give it.

Not that I don't appreciate
the embroidery of the crimes,

but still, murder?

receiving the letter to me,

I didn't quite understand
why you were betraying him,

his exquisite fiancee,
I understand completely.

He did not believe that
I had no idea where it was.

So he had me thrown in here
to refresh my memory.

Did Napoleon tell you
who was supposed to
pick up this letter?

- I told him...
- A Monsieur Clarion.

My grandfather
isn't well, monsieur.

791
01:07:38,497 --> 01:07:41,898
Even if he were,
he would not receive visitors
at 11:00 in the evening.

792
01:07:41,967 --> 01:07:44,265
Perhaps he might make
an exception...

793
01:07:44,336 --> 01:07:46,998
for a man who is seeking
E-Edmond Dantes.

of Edmond?

- Monsieur Morell?
- Yes?

801
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:20,564
You knew... Edmond also?

802
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:22,573
Like a son.

803
01:08:25,511 --> 01:08:29,811
I was hoping you could tell me where
to find his family.

804
01:08:29,882 --> 01:08:32,908
Unfortunately,
his father hanged himself...

805
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:36,751
after learning
of Edmond's treason.

And...

01:08:44,463 --> 01:08:48,923
this...

810
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:51,799
- Who accused him?
- Who knows?

811
01:08:51,871 --> 01:08:55,534
Monsieur Villefort,
the man who had Edmond arrested,

812
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:58,270
left for Paris soon after
to take up the post...

of chief prosecutor.

814
01:09:00,379 --> 01:09:03,712
Of course, the shock of his father's
violent murder...

815
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:06,377
may also have spurred
his departure.

816
01:09:07,753 --> 01:09:10,984
They were strange times.

817
01:09:11,056 --> 01:09:15,186
You seem to have fallen
on difficult times yourself, sir.

818
01:09:15,261 --> 01:09:18,958
After Edmond's death,
I reluctantly took on a partner.

- [Puts Bottle Down]
- One of my captains.

And then one day,

My fate is nothing
compared to Edmond's.

Perhaps your luck
is about to change.

I shall search out
Edmond's fiancee.

826
01:09:42,488 --> 01:09:44,615
You mean
the Countess Mondego?

827
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:49,593
- Countess?
- Yes.

828
01:09:49,662 --> 01:09:52,597
A month after poor Edmond
was arrested,

his best friend.

830

- Fernand.
- Yes, that's right.

831
01:09:58,671 --> 01:10:01,606
And with the death
of his father and brother in the war,

832
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:04,541
Fernand became Count Mondego.

Yes. I must go.

- I'm sorry I was not more helpful.
- Oh, no.

what I needed to know.

Did you fall off the bed?

951
01:22:57,882 --> 01:23:02,615
After 13 years of sleeping
on a stone slab, I can't.

Mi Maria.
Does that hurt?

953

Did you come here
for a reason?

954
01:23:10,395 --> 01:23:12,920
Mondego has a son.

- Albert wishes to talk with us.
- Not now!

Tell him I'm trying
to protect his inheritance.

Are you afraid he's
going to squander his as you have yours?

958
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,948
I don't recall hearing your
complaints when I elevated you
from a fishmonger's daughter.

then I shall be going out.

May I remind you, my love,
that in Paris there are
mistresses aplenty,

961
01:23:38,356 --> 01:23:41,814

only one son.

- I will, Father.

Several of my friends
are going to Rome for two weeks

- And no chaperons? You're only 15.
- Almost 16.

Make it my birthday present,
Father, please.

- I won't get into trouble.
- No.

969
01:24:03,615 --> 01:24:07,073
Of course he can go.
I could do with some peace

- We are bad men, and for the money.
- My money is in my waistcoat.

Not anymore.
Besides, it's not your money
we're interested in.

You are the only son

but a note won't reach
your father for two weeks,

and then there's the endless
debates about whether
we killed you already.

No, a note just doesn't have the impact.
Perhaps if we send him your ring.

Yes. My ring bears

are less than reputable.

- He's foreign,

1100
01:34:50,728 --> 01:34:53,128

1101
01:34:53,197 --> 01:34:55,358
I hear he aided
your son.

1102
01:34:55,433 --> 01:34:59,096
- Why does he seek your counsel?
- Why should I tell you?

1103
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:02,799
When my son
returned from Rome,

1104
01:35:02,873 --> 01:35:06,274
he mentioned he'd
heard Monte Cristo saying
he was expecting a shipment.

1105
01:35:06,344 --> 01:35:08,938
He also heard the words "gold"...

1106
01:35:09,013 --> 01:35:10,810
and "Spada."

1107

- You don't believe...

1108
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:18,278
Monte Cristo has found
the treasure of Spada.

1109
01:35:18,356 --> 01:35:21,450
Not an hour ago,
he asked me to help him avoid
troublesome inspections...

1110
01:35:21,525 --> 01:35:23,993
on a shipment coming
from Marseilles.

- I could have him arrested.

Don't do that.
Let's just relieve him of it.

- How do you propose...
- I have an acquaintance
who deals in these matters.

1114
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:36,865
Tell Monte Cristo
you'll get his shipment through Customs,

1115
01:35:36,941 --> 01:35:39,933
but that it will
have to stay in port overnight.

1116
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:43,741
I shall have it removed
and taken to my old family
estate in Bouchon,

to beg the count...

to allow me to give
the birthday toast to Albert.

I was so insistent, and such
is the graciousness of our host,

that he reluctantly gave up
his fatherly right...

When I arrived
in the catacombs,

I watched as the criminals,
who tied Albert to a wall,

1141
01:37:11,135 --> 01:37:13,797
threatened to cut off
his finger and send it to his father...

02:00:12,044 --> 02:00:17,209
But now I must
explain something to you.

1407
02:00:17,283 --> 02:00:19,945
Where you really come from.

1408
02:00:20,019 --> 02:00:24,080
Albert, you are
the son of Edmond Dantes.

1409
02:00:30,696 --> 02:00:33,859
The man you know as
the Count of Monte Cristo.

1410
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:50,205
Well, I'm afraid
it is true.

1411
02:00:50,282 --> 02:00:53,774
You are the walking proof
that your mother
was as much of a whore...

1412
02:00:53,853 --> 02:00:56,344
in her younger years
as she is today.

1413
02:00:56,422 --> 02:00:58,549
[Albert]
You...

1414
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,785
You let me fight him?

1415
02:01:03,863 --> 02:01:06,661
It didn't do
any good though, did it?

1416
02:01:06,732 --> 02:01:09,360
Fernand, I beg you.
No more!

1417
02:01:09,435 --> 02:01:11,369
I want no more of this.

1418
02:01:12,738 --> 02:01:17,402
Just go.
Call it mercy.

1419
02:01:17,476 --> 02:01:19,467
Mercy, Fernand.

1420
02:01:25,751 --> 02:01:31,087
You've only got one shot,
and it will take
more than that to stop me.

1421
02:01:31,156 --> 02:01:34,751
Well, then I'd best
put it where it will do
the most damage.

1422
02:01:36,428 --> 02:01:38,726
[Albert]
No!

1423
02:01:38,797 --> 02:01:41,265
Mother! Mother!

1424
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:45,030
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look what I've done. Jacopo!

1425
02:01:48,774 --> 02:01:50,674
Hyah!

1426
02:01:55,514 --> 02:01:57,573
Once again, Zatarra,

1427
02:01:57,650 --> 02:01:59,982
God sees you out of
the corner of His eye.

1428
02:02:00,052 --> 02:02:01,986
She'll live.

1429
02:02:06,926 --> 02:02:08,359
[Whinnies]

1430
02:02:34,987 --> 02:02:37,455
- [Fernand] Edmond!
- [Whimpers]

1431
02:02:37,523 --> 02:02:40,549
Edmond!

1432
02:02:40,626 --> 02:02:44,392
Please don't go
out there. Don't.

1433
02:02:44,463 --> 02:02:46,556
Edmond, don't go.

1434
02:02:46,632 --> 02:02:50,227
You try.
Don't ever quit.

1435
02:02:50,302 --> 02:02:52,770
Zatarra,

1436
02:02:52,838 --> 02:02:55,966
you must end this.

1437
02:02:57,643 --> 02:03:01,101
Even the priest
will understand that.

1438
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:05,276
- Edmond!
- [Mercedes Whispering]
Please don't leave.

1439
02:03:07,553 --> 02:03:10,317
Watch over your mother.

1440
02:03:30,009 --> 02:03:35,311
Now, I couldn't live in a world
where you have everything
and I have nothing.

1441
02:04:57,863 --> 02:04:59,524
[Groans]

1442
02:05:16,148 --> 02:05:18,810
What happened
to your mercy?

1443
02:05:18,884 --> 02:05:23,787
I'm a count,
not a saint.

1444
02:05:23,856 --> 02:05:27,519
[Panting]

1445
02:06:04,463 --> 02:06:08,957
You were right, priest.
You were right.

1446
02:06:10,669 --> 02:06:13,035
This I promise you...

1447
02:06:13,105 --> 02:06:17,474
and God:

1448
02:06:17,543 --> 02:06:20,706
All that was used
for vengeance...

1449
02:06:20,779 --> 02:06:25,045
will now be used for good.

1450
02:06:25,117 --> 02:06:29,349
So rest in peace, my friend.

1451
02:06:29,421 --> 02:06:32,652
So, Zatarra,

1452
02:06:32,724 --> 02:06:34,885
painful, huh?

1453
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,793
No.

1454
02:06:43,268 --> 02:06:48,433
I bought this place,
thinking one day
I would tear it down.

1455
02:06:48,507 --> 02:06:51,169
But now the only things
I care about...

1456
02:06:51,243 --> 02:06:55,680
are walking off
this island with me.

1457
02:06:55,747 --> 02:06:58,580
Let's go home.
