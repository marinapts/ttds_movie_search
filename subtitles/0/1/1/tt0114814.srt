1
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,994
SAN PEDRO

2
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,391
How you doin', Keaton?

3
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,756
I can't feel my legs,

4
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,235
Keyser.

5
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,196
Ready?

6
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,756
What time is it?

7
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,396
12.30.

8
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,233
It all started back
in New York six weeks ago.

9
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,716
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

10
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,236
The driver saw nobody, but
somebody fucked up. He heard a voice.

11
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,918
Sometimes that's all you need.

12
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,516
NEW YORK CITY

13
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,553
Mr McManus?

14
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,478
Christ, don't you fuckin' guys ever sleep?

15
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,717
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

16
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,792
Todd Hockney?

17
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,878
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

18
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,911
Shit. Freeze!

19
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,156
Hold it!

20
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,992
Sure you brought enough guys?

21
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,715
It's quite simple.
A restaurant that changes with the taste

22
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,235
without losing the overall aesthetic.

23
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,558
In other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

24
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,439
- Where will it be?
- Let me give you an example.

25
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
This I had to see for myself.

26
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,116
David.

27
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,073
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

28
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,714
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

29
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,752
Special Agent Kujan, US Customs.

30
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,156
These gentlemen are from
the New York Police Department.

31
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,153
You look good, Keaton.
Better than I would have thought.

32
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,679
<i>Il y a un problme?</i>

33
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,758
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

34
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,194
- Mr Keaton?
- Will you excuse us for a moment?

35
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,954
We have some questions
to ask you downtown.

36
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,119
<i>- Peut-tre nous vous laisserions...
- No, no, no, please. Please sit down.</i>

37
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,198
This is a small problem.

38
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,198
- Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.
- OK.

39
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,918
<i>- Qu'est-ce qui s'est pass I?
- Non, c'est pas du tout un problme.</i>

40
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,759
<i>- C'est la police, n'est-ce pas?
- a a I'air.</i>

41
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,836
<i>a va.</i>

42
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,039
<i>Unique.</i>

43
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,878
<i>Oui!</i>

44
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,676
<i>It didn't make sense that I'd be there.</i>

45
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,519
<i>I mean, these guys
were hard-core hijackers.</i>

46
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,596
<i>But there I was.</i>

47
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,756
<i>At that point I wasn't scared.</i>

48
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,316
<i>I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.</i>

49
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,519
<i>Besides, it was fun.
I got to make like I was notorious.</i>

50
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,438
<i>You know the drill.</i>

51
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,236
<i>When your number is called, step forward
and repeat the phrase you've been given.</i>

52
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,356
<i>Number one, step forward.</i>

53
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

54
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,196
<i>Number two, step forward.</i>

55
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,276
Give me the fucking keys,
you fucking cocksucker, motherfucker...

56
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,517
Knock it off! Get back!
Number three, step forward.

57
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,996
<i>- Hand me the keys.
- In English, please.</i>

58
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,118
<i>- Excuse me?
- In English!</i>

59
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,473
Hand me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker. What the fuck?

60
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,636
<i>Number four, step forward.</i>

61
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,558
<i>It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.</i>

62
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,717
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

63
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,396
<i>It was all the cops' fault. You don't
put guys like that into a room together.</i>

64
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,516
<i>Who knows what can happen?</i>

65
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,553
<i>Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.</i>

66
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,956
This has really gotta be
embarrassing for you guys.

67
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,517
<i>They drilled us all night. Somebody was
pissed about that truck getting hijacked.</i>

68
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,677
<i>They were hoping somebody
would give them something to go on.</i>

69
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,475
<i>They knew we wouldn't fight it
because they knew how to lean on us.</i>

70
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,315
<i>Our rights went out the window.
It was a violation. Disgraceful.</i>

71
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,153
<i>They went after McManus first -
a top-notch entry man.</i>

72
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,795
- What truck?
- The truck with the guns, fucko.

73
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,712
Fucko?

74
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,196
<i>He was a good guy. Crazy though.</i>

75
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,112
Wanna know what Fenster told us?

76
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,755
- Say who?
- McManus! He told us another story.

77
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,395
Oh, is that the one about
the hooker with dysentery?

78
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,432
<i>Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a tight-ass,</i>

79
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,836
<i>but when it came to the job
he was right-on - a smart man.</i>

80
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,434
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

81
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,160
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

82
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,475
- Yeah, I'm shakin'. Come on.
- OK.

83
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,394
- Answer my question.
- Can you hear me in the back?

84
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,913
Hello?

85
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,716
I want my lawyer. I'm gonna have
your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

86
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,593
<i>Todd Hockney. Good with explosives.</i>

87
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,156
<i>Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.</i>

88
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,475
You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.

89
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,235
You think so? I could put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

90
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,799
Really?

91
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,674
I live in Queens. Did you put
that together yourself, Einstein?

92
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,115
Got a team of monkeys workin' on this?

93
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,716
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

94
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,159
Fuck your father in the shower, then
have a snack. You gonna charge me?

95
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,633
When I'm ready.

96
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,479
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

97
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,195
<i>But Keaton was the real prize for them,
for obvious reasons.</i>

98
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,515
It was your mistake, not mine.

99
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,636
Did you ever stop to ask me?

100
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,918
I mean, I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

101
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,635
- I'm a business man.
- What's that, the restaurant business?

102
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,315
From now on you're in
the getting-fucked-by-us business.

103
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,835
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

104
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,597
Like I said, it was your mistake. Not mine.

105
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,356
Now, you charge me
with this shit and I'll beat it.

106
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,556
OK?

107
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,836
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

108
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,276
I really, really think somebody
should do something about this shit.

109
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,157
So I did a little time. Does that mean I get
railed every time a truck finds its way...

110
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,838
Fuck 'em!

111
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,919
Fenster, will you relax? These guys
don't have any probable cause.

112
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,437
You're fucking-A right.
No PC. No goddamn right.

113
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,314
You do some time, never let you go.
They treat me like a criminal.

114
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,997
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal!

115
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,233
Now, what you gotta go and do that?

116
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,557
- I'm tryin' to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?

117
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,796
You're makin' me tired all over.

118
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,558
Well, fuck it then.

119
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,036
- I heard you were dead.
- Oh, yeah? Well, you heard right.

120
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,436
Word I got is you hung up your
spurs, man. What's that all about?

121
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,357
What's this?

122
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,914
Rumour has it Keaton's gone straight.

123
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,958
- I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
- Who's that?

124
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,517
A heavyweight criminal lawyer from
uptown. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

125
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,394
How about it, Keaton?
You a lawyer's wife?

126
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,516
What kind of retainer are you givin' her?

127
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,598
Hey, Fenster, do your friend a favour.

128
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,472
Tell him to keep quiet.

129
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,316
Dean Keaton.

130
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,156
Gone clean, huh?

131
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,716
Say it ain't so.
Or was it you that hit that truck?

132
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,396
Mac, Mac, forget him.
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

133
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,757
- This whole thing was a shakedown.
- What makes you say that?

134
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,673
How many times you been in a line-up?

135
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,158
It's always you and four dummies. PD pay
homeless guys $10 a head half the time.

136
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,477
And there's no way
they'd line five felons in the same row.

137
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,236
And a voice line-up? A public
defender can get you outta that one.

138
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,836
- So why the hell was I strip-searched?
- That was the feds.

139
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,556
Truckload of guns get snagged. Customs
comes down on NYPD wanting answers.

140
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,280
They come up with us.
They're clutching at straws.

141
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,359
- I had a guy's finger up my asshole.
- Is it Friday already?

142
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,918
Yeah, lover boy. You want a piece?

143
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,476
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

144
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,312
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

145
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,557
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, working man?

146
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,035
Fuck who did it!
I wanna know who's the gimp.

147
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,395
- He's OK.
- How do I know that?

148
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,717
- What about it? What's your story?
- His name is Verbal.

149
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,356
- Verbal Kint.
- Verbal?

150
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,314
- Yeah.
- Roger really. People say I talk too much.

151
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,876
- I was just gonna tell you to shut up.
- We met before once or twice.

152
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,318
- In county. I was in for fraud.
- A line-up then, too. What happened?

153
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,238
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

154
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,920
- So you did it!
- All right, now, look.

155
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,073
We've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

156
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,159
So I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

157
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,397
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

158
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,354
- Why don't you just calm down?
- What do you care what he has to say?

159
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,756
I'm just talkin' here.

160
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,675
It seems like Mr Hockney wants to hear
what I got to say. I know Fenster's down.

161
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,516
What about you, guy?

162
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,516
I'm interested. Sure.

163
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,397
There, see? So now I'd like
to exercise my right to free assembly.

164
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,431
Why don't you just shut up?

165
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,396
You're missing the point.

166
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,312
No.

167
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,476
You're missing the point.

168
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,915
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

169
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,396
I don't care about your job.

170
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,116
And...

171
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,879
I want nothing to do with any of you.

172
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,356
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

173
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,276
Dean Keaton, gone the high road.

174
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,796
What is the world coming to?

175
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,436
Fuck him.

176
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,875
<i>That was how it started. Five men
brought in on a trumped-up charge</i>

177
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,395
<i>to be leaned on by halfwits.</i>

178
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,674
OK. Now I really can't
talk about it much here...

179
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,156
<i>What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now,</i>

180
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,357
<i>was that these men would
never break, never lie down,</i>

181
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,152
<i>never bend over for anybody.</i>

182
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,236
<i>Anybody.</i>

183
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,278
SAN PEDRO

184
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,799
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI. How many dead?

185
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,157
15 so far. They're still pulling
bodies out of the water though.

186
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,871
- Any survivors?
- Yeah, two.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,434
One guy's in county hospital,
but he's in a coma.

188
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,518
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York, I think.

189
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,635
The chief wants this place sealed off.
If you have any questions, give him a call.

190
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,836
<i>This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i>

191
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,398
<i>If you need to reach me, call Jeff Rabin
of the San Pedro PD on extension 112.</i>

192
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,476
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

193
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,636
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you.

194
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,675
The DA came last night ready to arraign
even before they moved him to county.

195
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,995
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later,

196
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,237
DA comes out the office looking like
he'd been smacked around.

197
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,437
They take his statement
and they cut him a deal.

198
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,639
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanour two.

199
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,631
What is that?

200
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,116
Listen, I give the DA credit
for getting that much. Understand?

201
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,236
Excuse me, sir.

202
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,956
This whole thing has turned political.

203
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,636
The mayor was here last night. The chief.
This morning the governor called, OK?

204
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,799
I'm telling you this guy is protected from
up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

205
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,275
- Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?

206
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,556
- Two hours, tops.
- I wanna see him.

207
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,477
- No, Dave.
- I gotta see him.

208
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,479
- Dave, no! I cannot do this for you.
- You gotta. I came a long way for this.

209
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,956
Dave, please.

210
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,795
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

211
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,396
He's paranoid. He knows the
interrogation rooms are all wired.

212
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,235
I quit. This won't be an interrogation.
Just a friendly chat.

213
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,272
- He will not go in the interrogation room.
- Someplace else.

214
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,152
Where?

215
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,793
No, no, no, no, no...

216
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,276
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it in?

217
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,916
- I'm sure you have a host of wild theories.
- They know damn well what I think.

218
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,915
That's crazy! Besides, the guy's got
total immunity. His story checks out.

219
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,239
- He doesn't know what you wanna know.
- I don't think he does. Not exactly.

220
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,516
But there's more to his story.

221
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,958
Jeffrey, look, I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier

222
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,318
for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

223
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,677
And, above all, I wanna
be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

224
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,918
- He's dead.
- Come on. Two hours.

225
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,076
Just till he makes bail.

226
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,556
They're all dead. I don't care how
tough a guy you say Keaton was,

227
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,439
nobody on that boat
could have come out alive.

228
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,399
- Is he talking?
- He just regained consciousness.

229
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,796
- He spoke... not English, then he lapsed.
- Hungarian.

230
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,832
- Might have been.
- Most were Hungarians.

231
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,078
- You gotta put on one of these.
- Burn victims are susceptible to infection.

232
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,435
And, of course, there's no smoking.

233
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,514
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

234
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,313
- Is he gonna die?
- He has burns over 60% of his body.

235
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,876
- A number of ribs are broken.
- Call Security. Put a man on the door.

236
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,036
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

237
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,833
Do it.

238
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,916
Do it now!

239
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,555
Joel? Yeah, Baer down at LA County.

240
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,554
Look, the guy they pulled out
of the harbour is Arkosh Kovash.

241
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,355
Yes. Yes. I'm sure.
No, he's all fucked up.

242
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,195
What? What? I can't hear you.

243
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,515
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

244
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,633
Yes?

245
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,117
Well, not until I put a man on him. Send
me someone who can speak Hungarian.

246
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,153
- Yeah, he's talking like a Thai hooker.
- Keyser Sze!

247
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,518
- What?
- Keyser Sze! Keyser Sze!

248
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,277
- Keyser Sze.
- No shit.

249
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,119
Joel. Yeah, call Dan Metzheiser at Justice
and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

250
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,752
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

251
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,432
Nice to meet you.

252
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,596
He wants to ask you a few questions.

253
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,678
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton mostly.

254
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,595
But I'd like to start at
the line-up in New York.

255
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,837
- Can I get coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the line-up.

256
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,276
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

257
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,597
One time I got so bad, my piss
come out like snot. It was thick...

258
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,679
- I'll get your fucking coffee.
- Get me one too while you're at it.

259
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,755
That guy is tense. Tension is a killer.

260
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,639
I was in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

261
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,514
The baritone was a guy named Kip Diskin.
Big, fat guy. I mean, like, orca fat.

262
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,235
- He was so stressed in the morning...
- Verbal, we're trying to help you.

263
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,995
Sure. And I appreciate that.
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.

264
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,675
I like cops. I would have liked
to have been a fed myself, but...

265
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,554
Verbal, you're not telling us everything.
I know you know something.

266
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,234
<i>I told the DA everything I know.</i>

267
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,395
<i>Verbal, I know you like Keaton.
I know you think he's a good man.</i>

268
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,199
<i>- I know he was good.
- He was a corrupt cop.</i>

269
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,039
<i>Sure, 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.</i>

270
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,276
- Anyway, cops wouldn't let him go legit.
- Dean Keaton was a piece of shit!

271
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,398
Are you trying to get
a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?

272
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,798
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

273
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,836
May I have a cigarette?

274
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,438
- According to your statement...
- I need a light.

275
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,275
According to your statement, you're
a short-con operator. Run-of-the-mill...

276
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,319
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

277
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,439
- Run-of-the-mill scams.
- It's been suppressed. It's inadmissible.

278
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,797
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

279
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,159
Well, I do have the weapons charge. I'm
looking at six whole months' hard time.

280
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,557
You know a dealer
named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

281
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,636
Know a religious guy named John Paul?

282
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,798
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

283
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,038
I know Ruby. He's big on respect. He's a
good friend of mine, likes me very much.

284
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,558
I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby has
a lot of friends inside do favours for him.

285
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,474
What do you think he'd say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

286
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,036
- There's nothing in there about Ruby.
- I'll mention that to him.

287
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,953
First thing on the job
I learnt how to spot a murderer.

288
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,675
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing and put 'em in jail.

289
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,956
Next day whoever's sleeping is your man.

290
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,716
If you're guilty, you know you're caught,
you get some rest. You follow me?

291
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,440
- No.
- Let me get right to the point.

292
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,273
I'm smarter than you and
I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

293
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,676
And I'm gonna get it from you
whether you like it or not.

294
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,756
I'm not a rat.

295
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,192
Thanks.

296
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,869
When I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we'd make fresh coffee right off the trees.

297
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,157
That was good. This is shit,
but, hey, I'm in a police station...

298
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,598
- Can we get started again?
- Now, what happened after the line-up?

299
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,034
The desk sergeant told me he couldn't
release you. Can you believe that?

300
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,118
You weren't even charged!
New York police.

301
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,953
I want pictures taken of your face.
I'll take 'em to the DA first thing.

302
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,755
- Forget about it.
- No! I'll have this in front of a grand jury!

303
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,838
Look, I don't wanna
talk about it, Edie. OK?

304
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,234
So what did Fortier and Renault say?

305
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,354
- They need more time to think about it.
- Dammit! More time for what, Edie?

306
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,594
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they'll still find out about me.

307
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,718
Give me some credit. I got you this far.

308
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,755
- Let's go to the grand jury. It won't stop!
- Look, it's never gonna stop, period!

309
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,757
By next week every investor in the city's
gonna be walkin' away from us.

310
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,278
It's finished.

311
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,356
I'm finished.

312
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,316
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

313
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,236
It's never gonna stop.

314
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,316
I love you.

315
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,795
They ruined me in there tonight.

316
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,596
I love you.

317
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,396
Do you hear me?

318
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,232
What?

319
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,235
All right.

320
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,316
Let's just go to my place.

321
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,836
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

322
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,318
Let's go.

323
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,240
<i>Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition.</i>

324
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,158
<i>A fast jump, high risk, long money.</i>

325
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,032
<i>We all knew it could be done.</i>

326
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,720
<i>The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.</i>

327
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,115
<i>To do it right took five men.</i>

328
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,236
<i>Five men meant Keaton.</i>

329
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,396
<i>Keaton took convincing.</i>

330
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,476
New York's Finest Taxi Service.

331
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,271
Bullshit.

332
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,152
Bullshit.

333
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,916
They don't operate any more.

334
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,039
McManus has a friend in the 14th
Precinct. They're coming out for one job.

335
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,517
They're picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds. McManus already has a fence.

336
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,513
- A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California named Redfoot.

337
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,359
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

338
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,917
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

339
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,514
They won't take me unless you go.

340
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,955
Look at me. I need this.

341
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,834
Oh, you're telling me you don't
need this? Is this your place?

342
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,278
I'm not knocking you. You got a good
scam going with this lawyer...

343
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,716
Sorry.

344
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,796
It's OK. It's OK.

345
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,434
You say it's the real thing, that's cool.

346
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,560
- You OK?
- I was outta line.

347
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,553
But they're never gonna
stop with us. You know that.

348
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,240
As clean as you could get,
they'll never let you go.

349
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,558
This way we hit the cops where it hurts
and we get well in the meantime.

350
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,475
- You sure you're OK?
- I'll be all right.

351
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,356
Look, I...

352
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,436
- I sometimes get...
- Forget it.

353
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,355
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

354
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,796
So...

355
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,516
how do they wanna do it?

356
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,553
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

357
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,996
Fenster? Hockney?

358
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,038
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

359
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,075
I got a way to do it without killing anyone,
but they won't let me in without you.

360
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,836
Three million?

361
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,996
Maybe more.

362
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,756
No killing?

363
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,596
Not if we do it my way.

364
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,072
<i>New York's Finest Taxi Service
was not your normal service.</i>

365
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,875
<i>It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD
that ran a high-profit racket</i>

366
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,560
<i>driving smugglers and
drug dealers round the city.</i>

367
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,275
<i>For a few hundred dollars a mile
you got your own police escort.</i>

368
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,152
<i>They even had business cards.</i>

369
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,159
<i>After a while somebody started asking
questions and the service shut down.</i>

370
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,795
<i>Since then Internal Affairs have
been waiting to catch them in the act.</i>

371
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,672
<i>That's where we came in.</i>

372
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,360
- So, how was the flight?
- Fucking great.

373
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,436
Will this get me to Staten Island?

374
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,194
You kidding me?
This'll get you to Cape Cod.

375
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,598
<i>McManus brought us the job. Fenster got
the vans, Hockney supplied the hardware.</i>

376
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,075
<i>I came up with how to do it
so no one got killed.</i>

377
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,795
<i>But Keaton? Keaton
put on the finishing touch.</i>

378
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,515
<i>A little "fuck you"
from the five of us to the NYPD.</i>

379
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,875
All right, watch this, watch this.
Careful, careful!

380
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,434
Come on, asshole! Fuck!

381
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,996
Holy shit!

382
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,197
- Don't move, you fuckers!
- Drop it now, motherfucker.

383
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,437
- Hurry up!
- Drop it! Don't fuckin' move!

384
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,518
- What do you want?
- Put the fuckin' thing away.

385
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,639
- Stupid asshole.
- Don't fuckin' move, mama!

386
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,833
You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?

387
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,873
Fuck!

388
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,635
- Afternoon, pork chops. Give me the shit.
- Give him the fuckin' shit!

389
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,512
Give him the fuckin' thing!

390
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,995
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

391
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,070
Hurry up!

392
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,276
- Come on!
- Now the money.

393
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,277
- There's no money.
- Give me the money!

394
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,436
- There's no fuckin' money!
- Give me it!

395
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,433
- Give me the fuckin' money!
- Give him the money!

396
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,676
- Give me the money!
- Give him the money!

397
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,836
Hurry up!

398
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,039
Motherfucker! You know who the fuck I
am? You people know who the fuck I am?

399
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,913
- Fuck!
- We do now, jerk-off.

400
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,556
Wait a minute. What's that?

401
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,553
What the fuck...? Holy shit!

402
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,355
Go! Go! Go!

403
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,799
<i>Keaton made an anonymous phone call.
The press arrived before the police did.</i>

404
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,554
<i>Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.</i>

405
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,478
<i>Within a few weeks
50 more cops went down with them.</i>

406
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,115
<i>Everybody got it right in the ass
from the chief on down.</i>

407
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,236
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

408
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,556
I owe you $2.50.

409
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,476
Dr Keaton.

410
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,195
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

411
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,114
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

412
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,595
In California?

413
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,472
Yes, Verbal. In California.

414
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,160
- Fenster and I...
- Wait. Hold the fuckin' phone.

415
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,034
You and Fenster? No, no, no, no, no.
You fuckin' kiddin' me?

416
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,799
OK, so everyone's gonna go.

417
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,196
We all go.

418
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,394
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

419
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,876
My fuckin' problem is that
you and Fenster are off in California

420
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,835
- while we're sittin' here holdin' our dicks!
- Hey! The job's over.

421
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,831
Cool it.

422
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,315
LA's a good place to lie low for a while.

423
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,316
You wanna dance?

424
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,432
Ladies...

425
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,835
I would like to propose a toast.

426
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,397
There you go.

427
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,436
To Mr Verbal.

428
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,476
The man with the plan.

429
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,555
We're gonna miss the flight.

430
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,240
Don't do this. Send her a note, something.

431
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,356
I said we'll make it.

432
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,596
We're gonna miss the plane.

433
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,757
She'll understand.

434
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,680
That's heart-warming. Really.

435
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,795
I'm weepy.

436
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,876
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

437
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,998
You guys wanted to know
what happened after the line-up.

438
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,999
Come on, Verbal.
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

439
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,157
You expect me to believe that he retired?

440
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,236
For a woman?

441
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,238
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

442
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,555
- He loved her.
- Sure.

443
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,956
<i>I'm supposed to believe
hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea?</i>

444
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,595
<i>- That was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.</i>

445
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,356
<i>- Who'd know the service better?
- But Edie had him turned around.</i>

446
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,996
Let me tell you something.
I know Dean Keaton.

447
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,839
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

448
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,713
The guy I know was
a cold-blooded bastard.

449
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,799
IAD indicted him on three murder counts
before he was kicked off the force.

450
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,635
- So don't sell me the hooker with a heart.
- You got him all wrong.

451
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,437
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total
of seven times while he was on the force.

452
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,474
In every case the witnesses
either reversed their testimony,

453
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,433
or died before they could testify.

454
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,838
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

455
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,315
He killed three prisoners inside.

456
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,795
Of course, I can't prove this.

457
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,915
But I can't prove the best part either.

458
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,316
Dean Keaton was dead.

459
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,479
Did you know that? He died in a fire
two years ago during an investigation

460
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,155
into the murder of a witness
who was going to testify against him.

461
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,274
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into
a warehouse he owned before it blew up.

462
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,876
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

463
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,396
It blew up and took
all of Dean Keaton with it.

464
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,195
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

465
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,436
One killed himself in his car,

466
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,313
the other fell down
an open elevator shaft.

467
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,197
- Get this show on the road.
- There are too many people here.

468
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,557
Doctor, we'll be out of here
before he blows his porch light.

469
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,796
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

470
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,916
Everyone, calm down, all right?

471
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,715
I want you to ask this man
about the shoot-out in the harbour.

472
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,553
- He says they were buying...
- Dope. We know.

473
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,034
He doesn't know what they were buying,
but not dope. People.

474
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,116
What?

475
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,313
- He needs guarantees.
- What is he talking about?

476
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,556
He says his life's in danger.

477
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,276
He saw the devil, looked him in the eye.

478
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,874
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.

479
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,998
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

480
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,076
about the devil.

481
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,316
Who's the devil?

482
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,597
Keyser Sze.

483
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,596
- Keyser Sze?
- He was in the harbour killing many men.

484
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,676
He saw Keyser Sze?

485
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,037
- He saw his face.
- Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

486
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,116
- Describe him.
- OK.

487
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,674
<i>Six weeks ago
an anonymous call tells me</i>

488
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,315
<i>I can find Keaton at Mondino's
with his attorney. And there he is.</i>

489
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,998
Because he never profited
from his alleged death

490
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,476
and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him,

491
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,955
we had to let him go.

492
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,078
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over,

493
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,077
and then he had lunch.

494
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,237
- I don't know about that.
- I don't think you do.

495
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,109
But you say you saw Keaton die. You're
covering his ass and he's still out there.

496
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,037
I think he's behind that whole circus at the
harbour. He's using you cos you're stupid.

497
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,399
You tell me he's dead, so be it. I wanna be
sure he is before I go back to New York.

498
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,637
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

499
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,756
What lawyer?

500
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,674
- What lawyer, Verbal?
- When I was in that barbershop quartet...

501
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,799
I know you held out on the DA!
What did you leave out of that testimony?

502
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,435
- I can call up Ruby in ten minutes!
- The DA gave me immunity.

503
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,075
Not from me. You get no immunity
from me, you piece of shit.

504
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,397
Every criminal I've put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favour,

505
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,519
every creep that walks the street for
a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

506
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,076
Now you talk to me, or that immunity
they seem so fit to grant you

507
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,597
won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

508
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,316
There was a lawyer.

509
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,475
Kobayashi.

510
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,077
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No. But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

511
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,631
Convince me.

512
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,716
And tell me every last detail.

513
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,638
<i>We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus's fence, Redfoot.</i>

514
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,275
<i>He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.</i>

515
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,436
<i>Still, we should've known better.</i>

516
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,357
- How you doin'?
- Good. You?

517
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,755
Not bad. Can't complain.

518
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,076
How's it goin', Fenster?

519
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,756
Don't need to open it, right?

520
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,516
You must be Keaton.

521
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,556
Redfoot, Dean Keaton,
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.

522
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,796
Verbal. The man with the plan.

523
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,355
- Interested in any more work?
- We're always lookin' for extra work.

524
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,439
- We're on vacation.
- Well, that's too bad.

525
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,557
I got a ton of work and I don't have
any good people like you guys.

526
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,593
- What's the job?
- A jeweller out of Texas named Saul.

527
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,238
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.
He does free appraisals for people.

528
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,557
Anyway, the word is
he carries around a lot of cash.

529
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,999
So I figure I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green. Simple.

530
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,954
- What about security?
- Bodyguards. Nothing you can't handle.

531
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,958
- Give me time to check it out?
- I'd expect nothing less from you, man.

532
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,196
Good to see you. We'll call you.

533
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,193
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

534
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,276
Hey...

535
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,276
A friend of mine in New York tells me that
you know, that you knew Spook Hollis.

536
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,358
The way I hear it,
you did time with old Spook.

537
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,636
Good man, wasn't he?

538
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,035
I used to run dope for him.

539
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,156
- Too bad he got shieved.
- Yeah.

540
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,356
I shieved him.

541
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,475
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

542
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,516
I appreciate that.

543
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,395
Just out of curiosity,
was it business or personal?

544
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,396
A bit of both.

545
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,438
Well, like I said, you give me a call
if you're interested, all right?

546
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,956
Is there a problem?

547
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,073
One job. That was the deal.

548
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,396
One job?

549
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,476
One job!

550
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,356
That's a good one, Keaton.

551
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,955
<i>Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.</i>

552
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,992
<i>He can convince anyone
he's someone else, but never himself.</i>

553
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,635
<i>It took one day with McManus
nagging him, and we went back to work.</i>

554
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,035
So, I get out of my car.
I think it's wrecked.

555
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,317
In the back seat of the other car,
this woman's totally naked!

556
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,597
- I'm laughin' so hard, I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

557
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,716
Freeze! Freeze!

558
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,995
There's a second one here somewhere.

559
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,160
Give me the case.
Give me the fuckin' case!

560
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,953
Give me the case.

561
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,835
I'm telling you for the last time,
give me the fuckin' case!

562
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,158
- Come on!
- Hey! Don't move.

563
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,034
Look, just hand over the case.

564
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,116
Hand over the fuckin' case!

565
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,514
Come on. Let's go!

566
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,518
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

567
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,835
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

568
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,192
Fuck!

569
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,676
Looks like a lot of china to me. Shit.

570
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,876
Guys, come on.

571
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,115
- What're you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.

572
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,913
- We did it your way, now my way.
- You gonna kill him?

573
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,996
- I'm gonna deal with it.
- You better.

574
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,076
I'm gonna deal with it. Shut up!

575
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,714
What am I supposed to do with that?

576
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,673
Feed it to the gimp, ease his pain.
I don't know what it is.

577
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,918
- What do you mean?
- I don't know. I got this job from a lawyer.

578
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,356
- Yeah, who?
- I don't know. Some limey.

579
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,756
He's a middle man for somebody, OK?
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

580
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,115
- You're fuckin' full of shit!
- Fuck you!

581
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,438
- Fuck you!
- Listen to me! We wanna meet him, OK?

582
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,516
That's funny.

583
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,553
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

584
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,114
- OK. We'll meet him.
- I'll call you.

585
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,755
- Good. Do that. No problem.
- I don't like it, Dean. Wait.

586
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,118
One more thing, tough guy. Any more
surprises and I'm gonna kill you.

587
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,718
Such a tough guy, McManus.
Do me a favour, get the fuck off my dick.

588
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,479
- Fuck!
- No! No!

589
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,113
Better put a leash on that puppy.

590
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,755
You know, it's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

591
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,037
The cops are gonna be
lookin' for the guys who did it.

592
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,357
Sooner or later they're gonna
come around askin' me.

593
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,916
You have a sweet night, ladies.

594
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,636
Fuck you.

595
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,640
- So this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

596
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,914
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

597
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,674
Why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

598
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,995
Dave, someone to see you.

599
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,872
Jack!

600
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,757
Been lookin' for you. Still after that coke
from the harbour blood bath yesterday?

601
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,435
- Yeah.
- Stop lookin'. There was no coke.

602
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,759
I been in LA County talkin' to a guy they
pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro.

603
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,836
He came to this morning.

604
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:13,478
He's in a Hungarian mob doing a deal with
Argentinians. Says it was no dope deal.

605
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,837
- But the $91 million...
- We know. He says no way on the dope.

606
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,316
He tells me they were pulling
stumps for Turkey the next day.

607
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,916
They had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it.

608
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,038
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know. No one knew.

609
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,239
Except for a few key people.
They were all very hush about it, he says.

610
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,359
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.

611
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,359
They tell me you got the cripple from
New York. Did he mention Keyser Sze?

612
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,312
Who?

613
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,396
Just bear with me here.

614
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,592
- Who's Keyser Sze?
- Fuck!

615
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,636
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

616
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,475
What we need to do is find Redfoot,
Keaton, and get the hell outta here.

617
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,717
What we need to do is think. Think back.

618
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,117
Somebody with power.

619
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,073
Somebody capable of
trackin' us from New York to LA.

620
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,476
- Dean, what the hell are we doin' here?
- We're waitin'!

621
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,075
- I'm out.
- Sit down.

622
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,515
No. It's hot and I'm fuckin' bored.

623
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,035
Mr Hockney, do stay.

624
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,718
Mr Keaton.

625
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,799
Mr Fenster I recognise from
his mug shots, as well as Mr McManus.

626
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,556
I can only assume that you are Mr Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

627
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,918
My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.

628
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,192
I am Mr Kobayashi.

629
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,836
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

630
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,754
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

631
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,355
One job. One day's work. Very dangerous.

632
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,796
He does not expect all of you to live,
but those of you who do

633
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,879
will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

634
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,956
Who's your boss?

635
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,272
I work for Keyser Sze.

636
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,675
- Who's Keyser Sze?
- Judging by the change in mood, Mr Kint,

637
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,718
I feel sure the rest of
your associates can tell you.

638
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,718
I come with an offer
directly from Mr Sze.

639
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,355
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean "an order"?

640
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,719
In 1981, Mr Keaton, you participated in a
hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

641
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,395
The cargo was raw steel.
Steel which belonged to Mr Sze

642
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:36,314
and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

643
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,637
A most profitable violation
of UN regulations.

644
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,116
You had no way of knowing this
because the fellow shipping the steel

645
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,477
was working for Mr Sze
without his knowledge.

646
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,795
Earlier this year Mr Fenster and Mr
McManus hijacked a flight out of Newark.

647
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,158
The plane was carrying gold and
platinum wiring, also set for Pakistan.

648
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,476
Two months ago Mr Hockney stole a
truck carrying gun parts through Queens.

649
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,195
Gun parts which were set to be
destroyed by the State of New York.

650
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,835
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

651
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,878
Again Mr Sze,
using pawns who had no knowledge.

652
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,594
Which brings us to Mr Kint.

653
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,399
Nine months ago one of
Mr Sze's less than intelligent couriers

654
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,877
was taken in a complicated
confidence scam by a cripple.

655
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,678
He was relieved of $62,000.

656
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,837
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

657
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,555
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

658
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,716
- You set up the line-up?
- Yes.

659
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,235
You were not to be released until I arrived.

660
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:47,799
It seems Ms Finneran was a little
too effective in expediting his release.

661
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,996
Holding the rest of you was a moot point.

662
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,839
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr Redfoot knew nothing.

663
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,520
Mr Sze rarely works
with the same people for long,

664
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,279
and they never know
who they're working for.

665
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,676
One cannot be betrayed,
if one has no people.

666
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,355
So, why are you telling us?

667
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,679
Because you have stolen from
Mr Sze, Mr Fenster. All of you.

668
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,918
That you did not know you stole from him
is the only reason you are still alive.

669
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,436
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

670
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,475
All right, fuck the debt and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Sze?

671
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,639
I don't think that is relevant, Mr Hockney.

672
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,117
All five of you are responsible for the
murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

673
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,558
Mr Redfoot can testify to your
involvement and we can see to it he will.

674
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,678
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

675
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,759
Mr Sze's primary interest is narcotics.

676
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,000
He's been competing, shall we say, with
a group of Argentinians for years now.

677
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,118
Competing with Mr Sze has taken its toll.

678
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,869
The Argentinians are negotiating the sale
of $91 m in cocaine in three days' time.

679
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,190
This purchase will revitalise the
diminishing strength of their organisation.

680
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,716
Mr Sze would like you to stop the deal.

681
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,354
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

682
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,597
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

683
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,840
Mr Sze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine on board.

684
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,118
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr Sze.

685
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,714
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

686
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,476
A gift from Mr Sze.

687
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,916
Good day, gentlemen.

688
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,038
My whole life's in here -
everything I've done since I was 18.

689
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,436
They fuckin' know everything.

690
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,199
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

691
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,513
No.

692
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,196
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

693
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,676
Who was that guy who used
to talk about Sze in New York?

694
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,398
- Bricks Marlin.
- Yeah, I did jobs for him. Indirect stuff.

695
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,718
He said he always made five times
more money than the job was worth.

696
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,594
This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's
usin' him for window-dressing.

697
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,237
- I don't know. This is bad.
- No, it's bullshit.

698
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,397
This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' set-up.

699
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,472
The way I hear it,
Sze is some kind of butcher.

700
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,838
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Sze!

701
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,676
Who is Keyser Sze?

702
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,835
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

703
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,996
Nobody ever believed he was real.

704
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,277
Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that worked directly for him,

705
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,439
but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody
could've worked for him. You never knew.

706
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,875
That was his power.

707
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,117
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled

708
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,158
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

709
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,878
One story the guys told me - the story
I believe - was from his days in Turkey.

710
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,560
A gang of Hungarians
wanted their own mob.

711
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:22,435
They realised that to be in power you
didn't need guns or money or numbers.

712
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,075
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

713
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,357
After a while they come into power,
and they come after Sze.

714
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,677
He was small-time then,
just running dope, they say.

715
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,079
They come to his home in the afternoon
looking for his business.

716
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,318
<i>They find his wife and kids in the house
and decide to wait for Sze.</i>

717
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,598
<i>He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.</i>

718
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,595
The Hungarians knew Sze was tough, so
they let him know they meant business.

719
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,276
<i>They tell him they want
his territory, all his business.</i>

720
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,558
Sze looks over the faces of his family,

721
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,275
then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

722
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,917
<i>He tells him he would
rather see his family dead</i>

723
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,435
<i>than live another day after this.</i>

724
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,915
<i>He lets the last Hungarian go,</i>

725
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,755
waits until his family are buried,
then goes after the rest of the mob.

726
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,955
He kills their kids, their wives,
their parents and their parents' friends.

727
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,116
<i>He burns down the houses they live in
and the stores they work in.</i>

728
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,796
<i>He kills people that owe them money.</i>

729
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,435
And like that... he's gone.

730
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,676
Underground.
Nobody's ever seen him since.

731
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,799
He becomes a myth, a spook story
that criminals tell their kids at night.

732
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,997
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Sze will get you. "

733
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,836
But no one ever really believes.

734
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,956
Do you believe in him, Verbal?

735
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,236
Keaton always said

736
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,477
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him. "

737
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,475
Well, I believe in God.

738
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,115
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Sze.

739
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,197
Do you give any weight to this?

740
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,233
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice. He has a file on Sze in DC.

741
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,275
<i>Been a hobby of his. Guys equate him
to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.</i>

742
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,516
- You've heard of him?
- On the street?

743
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,437
- Yeah.
- A few times.

744
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,518
Outside stuff.
Somebody working for a guy

745
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,515
who worked for a guy who got some
money from Keyser Sze, shit like that.

746
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,668
It could be an old badge, a hex sign,
to keep people from fucking with you.

747
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,876
- But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.

748
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,118
I got a guy trying to leave hospital on
a fried drumstick cos he's afraid of Sze.

749
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,316
Yeah, I'll run it up the flagpole.

750
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,919
I told it like it happened on the boat.
So what if I left out how I got there?

751
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,955
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to blow amnesty out my ass.

752
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,157
- That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me, Agent Kujan.

753
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,357
If I said the Loch Ness Monster
hired me, what would you say?

754
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:54,116
- Turn state's evidence, we'll hear it out.
- I got immunity. What can you offer me?

755
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,955
If there really is a Keyser Sze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

756
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,635
Where's your head? Where do you
think the pressure's coming from?

757
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,877
Keyser Sze, or whatever you
wanna call him, knows where I am.

758
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,959
He's got the front burner under your ass
to let me go, so he can scoop me up later.

759
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,556
Immunity was to deal with you.
I got a new problem when I post bail.

760
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,394
So why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

761
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,559
Gee, thanks, Dave.
Bang-up job so far - extortion, coercion.

762
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,551
Kiss my pucker.

763
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,595
The fuckers that rounded us up and sank
us are now bailing me out? Fuck you.

764
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,914
You think you can catch Keyser Sze?

765
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,556
You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?

766
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,433
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

767
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,678
After that, my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.

768
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,998
What happened next?

769
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:11,399
The next morning Fenster was gone.
He couldn't handle slumming for Sze.

770
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,116
He left us a note wishing us good luck
and took a chunk of the money.

771
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,800
- Then what?
- McManus was furious.

772
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,675
He was talking about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out, all sorts of shit.

773
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,236
- That night we got the call.
- What call?

774
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,834
Kobayashi told us
where we could find Fenster.

775
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,954
Let's get the fuck outta here.

776
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,676
- We gotta bury him.
- With what?

777
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,796
With our hands.

778
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,916
This is nuts.
It's dry fucking sand, McManus.

779
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,516
When he rots, the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

780
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,315
- Dig, you fuck!
- What we gonna do? He's gonna kill us.

781
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,956
I don't know about you, peg leg,
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

782
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,993
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

783
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,874
If you run, we're gonna be
diggin' a hole for you. You got that?

784
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,156
This ain't my boy we're buryin'.
I don't owe anybody!

785
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,595
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

786
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,919
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count, so fuck you!

787
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,793
- Cos now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

788
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:43,158
It's precaution. You want payback,
you wanna run, I don't care.

789
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,276
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

790
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,076
I'm not doin' it for you.

791
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,396
I'm doin' this for me.

792
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,876
I'm gonna finish this thing.

793
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,358
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

794
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:26,157
- After they killed Fenster nobody'd run?
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.

795
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,279
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.

796
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,518
It was too far-fetched for him.
Keaton was a grounded guy, an ex-cop.

797
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,037
To a cop, the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

798
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,720
There's no mystery,
no arch criminal behind it all.

799
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:45,196
If you got a dead body and
think his brother did it, you're right.

800
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,638
Nobody argued with Keaton. They just
set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.

801
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,235
They're coming up.

802
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,235
<i>Did you hear me? He's coming up.</i>

803
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,356
He's on his way down.

804
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,151
Don't move.

805
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,236
Press 20. Do it now.

806
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,152
Move!

807
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,433
- The answer is no.
- Mr Sze will be most upset...

808
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:34,758
Listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser
Sze. You mention him again, I'll kill you.

809
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,919
A strange threat. I can only assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

810
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,237
We know that you can get to us.

811
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,517
But now you know that we can get to you.

812
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,393
I'm giving you one
last chance to call this off.

813
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,435
Mr S... My employer has made up
his mind. He does not change it.

814
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,039
Neither do we.

815
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,756
You got Fenster, but you won't get all of
us before one of us gets through to you.

816
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,833
I believe you, Mr McManus.
I most sincerely do.

817
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,715
You would not have been chosen were
you not suitable, but it's not my decision.

818
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,314
Whatever you threaten
me with is ludicrous

819
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,156
in comparison to what will be done to me
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

820
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,395
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

821
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,036
I just wanted you to know that.

822
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,355
I'm so sorry, Mr McManus.

823
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,153
I implore you, Mr Keaton, believe me,

824
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,477
Mr Sze is very real and very determined.

825
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,596
We'll see.

826
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,635
Before you do me in, Mr McManus,

827
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,799
you will let me finish my business
with Ms Finneran first, won't you?

828
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,635
What did you say?

829
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,358
Edie Finneran.

830
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:13,156
She's upstairs in my office
for an extradition deposition.

831
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:18,318
I requested she be put on the case
personally. She flew in yesterday.

832
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,198
No matter.

833
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,276
Kill away, Mr McManus.

834
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,837
- You're lyin'.
- Am I?

835
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:53,599
Ms Finneran's escort while she's here in
LA. Never leaves her side for a moment.

836
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,877
I thought you'd be glad
to know she's in good hands.

837
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,634
Now rest. The boat will
be ready for you on Friday.

838
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,234
If I see you or any of
your friends before then,

839
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:10,956
Ms Finneran will find herself the victim
of a gruesome violation before she dies.

840
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,355
As, indeed, will your father, Mr Hockney,

841
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,515
and your Uncle Randall
in Arizona, Mr Kint.

842
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,394
I might only castrate
Mr McManus's nephew David.

843
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,557
Do I make myself clear?

844
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,796
We'll take care of the bodies downstairs.
We'll add them to the cost of Mr Fenster.

845
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,835
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

846
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:15,757
It's a logistical nightmare.
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

847
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,595
- No tellin' how many more are below.
- Can we stealth these guys?

848
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,235
Nah. With all that coke,
they're gonna be ready.

849
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,354
Which brings me to
sunny point number two.

850
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,116
Even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

851
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,717
- What if we wait for the money?
- Ten more men at least.

852
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,039
In my opinion it can't be done. Anybody
who goes in there is not comin' out alive.

853
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,919
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me, too.

854
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,476
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

855
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,596
Me, too.

856
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,800
There's nothing that can't be done.

857
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,475
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk into certain death.

858
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,875
The news said it's raining in New York.

859
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,877
- What language is that?
- I don't know.

860
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,956
Russian, I think.

861
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,476
Hungarian?

862
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,798
Package has arrived.

863
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,512
You kids ready?

864
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,393
I would be, if I didn't have
to stop and answer you.

865
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,274
I'm ready. McManus,
you better be set up in ten seconds.

866
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,555
I'm ready.

867
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,316
I want you to stay here.

868
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,119
- I'm supposed to cover the...
- Listen, if we fail, take the money and go.

869
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,437
- Keaton, I can't...
- Find Edie, tell her what happened.

870
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,676
She knows people, she knows what to do.

871
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,598
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

872
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,679
- What if I...
- Just do what I say. Please.

873
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,916
Tell her that...

874
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,796
Tell her I tried.

875
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,719
<i>McManus, he's on his way.</i>

876
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,796
I'm there.

877
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,635
One, two, three, four,

878
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,760
five, six, seven.

879
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,954
Oswald was a fag.

880
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,678
Hi.

881
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,756
How ya doin'?

882
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,876
Is there a problem?

883
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,956
Fernando...

884
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,594
<i>- Qu hace aqu?
- Nada.</i>

885
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,397
<i>- Aqu no puede pasar.
- No se puede pasar por aqu?</i>

886
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,714
<i>Mejor que se regrese.</i>

887
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,390
Now.

888
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,637
? Old Macdonald had a farm

889
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,995
? Ee-eye, ee-eye, oh

890
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,798
? And on that farm he shot some guys

891
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,880
? Bada-boom, bada-bing, bang, boom

892
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,635
Elvis has left the building.

893
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,756
<i>No dispare. Vmonos!</i>

894
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,076
Oh, man!

895
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,919
Hello.

896
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:13,759
- Why didn't you run?
- I froze up.

897
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,276
I thought about Fenster and
how he looked when we buried him.

898
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,154
Then I thought about Keaton.
It looked like he might pull it off.

899
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,074
Dave.

900
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:31,519
A boy came across a body on the beach
this morning. Shot twice in the head.

901
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,279
- Two men from the Bureau identified him.
- What else?

902
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,437
His name was Arturro Marquez,
a smuggler from Argentina.

903
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,398
He was arrested last year
in New York for trafficking.

904
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,956
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

905
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,237
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

906
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:52,275
Now, get this. Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

907
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,597
- Kobayashi.
- New York faxed a copy of his testimony.

908
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,995
- He was a rat.
- Yeah, a big fucking rat!

909
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,953
Arturro was very opposed
to returning to prison,

910
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,755
so much so that
he named close to 50 people.

911
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,235
Guess who he named in the finale?

912
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:11,157
- Keyser Sze.
- There's more.

913
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,959
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

914
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,516
There was no dope on that boat.

915
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,917
- You, stay quiet.
- He's here. I know he's here.

916
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:19,155
That's him. I'm telling you,
that's him. I know he's here!

917
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,836
You can't understand. That's him.

918
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,036
- Shut up!
- That's him. You hear me?

919
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,277
I'm telling you it's Keyser Sze!

920
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,196
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know. There's no coke!

921
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,158
- What?
- You heard me, you dumb fuck! No coke!

922
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:31,716
- What the fuck do you mean?!
- I've been in every fucking room!

923
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:35,714
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing! Nothing!

924
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,398
Don't fuck with me.

925
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,274
There is no... fucking... coke!

926
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,716
I'm outta here.

927
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,636
I told them nothing.

928
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,232
I swear.

929
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,715
I told them nothing. Please.

930
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,800
McManus, what the fuck is goin' on?

931
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,516
The strangest thing.

932
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,718
Your statement says you saw a man
in a suit with a slim build.

933
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,116
- Wait a minute.
- Are you saying you saw Keyser Sze?

934
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:33,596
- You said you didn't know who it was.
- There was dope on that boat.

935
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,318
- Stop stallin'.
- I'm not!

936
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,399
- You know what I'm gettin' at!
- Hey! I got immunity. I won't take this!

937
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,159
You know what I'm gettin' at, Verbal!

938
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,475
- I don't know!
- Yes, you do! The truth!

939
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,995
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

940
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,917
- I did.
- You're lying to me!

941
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,759
- I am not!
- You've known this whole fuckin' time!

942
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:55,395
I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot, I swear.

943
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,274
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun. He was your friend!

944
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,195
Because I was afraid. OK?

945
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,636
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

946
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,395
- I knew it was Keyser Sze.
- But Keaton...

947
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,155
It was Keyser Sze, Agent Kujan.
I mean, the devil himself.

948
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,675
How do you shoot the devil in the back?

949
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,236
What if you miss?

950
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,675
All right. Let's get back to the pier.

951
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,717
- Arturro Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

952
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,633
<i>He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.</i>

953
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,877
He swore out a statement
saying that he had seen

954
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,874
and could positively identify
one Keyser Sze.

955
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,436
It says in the report: "He had
intimate knowledge of his businesses,

956
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,434
including but not exclusive
to drug-trafficking and murder. "

957
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,073
I never heard of him.

958
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,760
His people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

959
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,316
<i>Most likely the same Hungarians
Sze all but wiped out back in Turkey.</i>

960
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,396
The money wasn't there for dope.

961
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,638
The Hungarians were gonna buy the one
guy that could incriminate Keyser Sze.

962
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,075
- I said I never heard of him.
- Keaton did.

963
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:35,916
<i>Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition
adviser. She knew what he knew.</i>

964
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,119
- I don't under...
- There were no drugs. It was a hit.

965
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:44,756
A suicide mission to whack out the
one guy that could finger Keyser Sze.

966
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,476
<i>So Sze put some thieves to it, men he
knew he could march into certain death.</i>

967
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,239
You're saying Sze
sent us to kill someone?

968
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,919
<i>Keaton did. Verbal,
he left you behind for a reason.</i>

969
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,917
Just do what I tell you.

970
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:02,795
If you all knew Sze'd find you anywhere,
why did he give you the money to run?

971
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,077
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

972
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,074
A one-time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world

973
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,476
finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple.

974
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,835
No, sir. Why?

975
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,276
- Edie.
- I don't buy the reform story for a minute.

976
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:24,315
<i>Even if I did, I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.</i>

977
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,396
So why?

978
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,836
Because he was my friend.

979
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,235
No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.

980
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,193
- Keaton didn't have friends.
- What are you doin' here?

981
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,915
He saved you because
he wanted it that way. It was his will.

982
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,954
- Keaton was Keyser Sze.
- No.

983
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:45,396
The kind of man who could wrangle
men like Hockney and McManus.

984
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:50,475
The kind of man who could engineer
a line-up through all his contacts at NYPD.

985
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,717
The kind of man who
could've killed Edie Finneran!

986
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,556
She was found yesterday at a hotel
in Pennsylvania, shot twice in the head.

987
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:10,033
What do you think
about Keaton now, Verbal?

988
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,115
Edie?

989
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:16,034
He used all of you to get him on that boat.
He couldn't get on alone.

990
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,556
He had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man.

991
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,553
The one man that could identify him.

992
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,432
This is all bullshit.

993
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,516
You said you saw him die.

994
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,077
Or did you? You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

995
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,754
<i>You said you heard the shot
before the fire.</i>

996
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,595
- But you didn't see him die.
- I knew him. He would never...

997
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:42,315
He programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to.

998
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,675
<i>He knew we were close,
you said it yourself.</i>

999
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:48,799
Where was the political pressure
coming from? It was Keaton.

1000
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,712
Immunity was your reward.

1001
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,592
But why me?

1002
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:57,236
Why not Fenster, McManus or Hockney?
I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?

1003
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,075
Because you're a cripple, Verbal.
Because you're stupid.

1004
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,196
Because you're weaker than them.

1005
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:10,954
If he's dead, if what you say is true,

1006
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,036
then it won't matter.

1007
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:18,198
It was his idea to hit the taxi service
in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.

1008
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,238
It was all Keaton.

1009
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:24,113
We followed him from the beginning.

1010
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:29,313
I didn't know. I saw him die.

1011
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,955
I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ!

1012
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,035
You're not safe on your own.

1013
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,033
- You think he's...
- Keyser Sze?

1014
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,836
I don't know, Verbal.

1015
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,475
Keyser Sze's a shield.
Or, like you said, a spook story.

1016
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:54,878
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1017
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,356
- Stay and let us protect you.
- No way. I'm not bait. I post today.

1018
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,232
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1019
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:03,796
Captain Leo wants you out of here ASAP,
unless you turn state's.

1020
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,558
I'll take my chances.

1021
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:09,275
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1022
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,637
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1023
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,756
Maybe so.

1024
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,835
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1025
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,356
Fuckin' cops.

1026
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,794
Excuse me. Can I use your fax machine?

1027
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,035
You'll have to sign for these, Mr Kint.

1028
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:13,239
One watch, gold.
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1029
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,076
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1030
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,796
We've still got nothing, Dave.

1031
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,155
I know what I wanted
to know about Keaton.

1032
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,072
Which is nothing.

1033
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,556
No matter. He'll have
to know how close we came.

1034
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,959
<i>Keyser Sze or no Keyser Sze,</i>

1035
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,117
<i>if Keaton is alive,
he's not coming up again.</i>

1036
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,316
<i>I'll find him.</i>

1037
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,396
<i>Waste of time.</i>

1038
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,238
<i>A rumour's not a rumour that doesn't die.</i>

1039
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:45,238
<i>- What?
- Nothin'.</i>

1040
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:52,075
- Man, you're a slob.
- Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave.

1041
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:56,677
It all makes sense when you look at
it right. You gotta stand back from it.

1042
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:01,195
You wanna see a real horror show,
you should see my garage.

1043
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,276
<i>Convince me.</i>

1044
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,359
<i>When I was in that barbershop quartet in
Skokie. Where's your head, Agent Kujan?</i>

1045
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:46,115
<i>- We need to think back.
- You've heard many tales.</i>

1046
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,158
<i>- Bricks Marlin.
- I wanna hear your story.</i>

1047
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,558
<i>It's all there. Some guy in California,
his name is Redfoot.</i>

1048
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:57,116
<i>- A gift from Mr Sze.
- What about Redfoot?</i>

1049
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:01,956
<i>- Mr Redfoot knew nothing.
- Big, fat guy. I mean, orca fat.</i>

1050
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,594
<i>There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.</i>

1051
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,957
<i>When I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we'd make fresh coffee.</i>

1052
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,159
<i>- You thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.</i>

1053
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:18,558
<i>- Tell me every last detail.
- How do you shoot the devil?</i>

1054
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:23,959
<i>- He's protected by the Prince of...
- What's your story?</i>

1055
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,116
<i>- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer, Verbal?</i>

1056
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,999
<i>- I am Mr Kobayashi.
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.</i>

1057
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:32,032
<i>- Tell me every last detail.
- I work for Keyser Sze.</i>

1058
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,435
<i>Convince me. Convince me.</i>

1059
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:53,196
<i>Every creep that works the street for a
living will know the name of Verbal Kint.</i>

1060
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,318
The cripple, did you see him?!

1061
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,318
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- That way.

1062
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,795
<i>I know you know something.</i>

1063
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:04,435
<i>I'm smarter than you and
I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.</i>

1064
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,678
<i>- To a cop, the explanation's simple.
- You know what I'm gettin' at! The truth!</i>

1065
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:12,799
<i>- ... no arch criminal behind it all.
- Somebody with power.</i>

1066
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,396
<i>- Keyser Sze!
- Who's Keyser Sze?</i>

1067
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:22,038
<i>You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?</i>

1068
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,158
<i>Because you're stupid, Verbal.
Because you're a cripple.</i>

1069
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,556
<i>- Who's the gimp?
- You've known the whole fuckin' time!</i>

1070
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,598
<i>- Who's Keyser Sze?
- Who's Keyser Sze?</i>

1071
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:36,157
<i>- I'm sure Keaton is dead.
- I can't feel my legs, Keyser.</i>

1072
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,596
<i>First thing I learnt on the job
was how to spot a murderer.</i>

1073
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,594
<i>They tell me you got the cripple from
New York. He mention Keyser Sze?</i>

1074
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:44,755
<i>Who?</i>

1075
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:49,635
<i>After that... my guess is
you'll never hear from him again.</i>

1076
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:14,640
<i>The greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convincing the world he didn't exist.</i>

1077
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,795
And like that...

1078
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,876
he's gone.
