1
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:33,023
London. The greatest city
in the world.

2
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,867
For 22 years, I've lived here.

3
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:39,704
Every morning I take a walk
down this street.

4
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:43,199
Every morning, the street asks me
my name...

5
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:49,708
Chaudhary Baldev Singh? Who are you?
Where are you from? Why are you here?

6
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,709
Do I have a reply? After half
a lifetime spent here...

7
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,377
this land still remains alien
to me, and I to it.

8
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:06,715
No one here knows me. None except
these doves. Because they're like me.

9
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:11,889
Neither do they belong to a country.
Just drop down where you find food.

10
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:14,399
Have your fill, then fly on.

11
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:20,898
When shall I fly? I don't know.
Of necessity, my wings are clipped.

12
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:28,240
I'm shackled to my bread.
But someday I'll surely go...

13
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:32,743
to my land. To my Punjab

14
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:48,758
"When the koels sing in spring,
it's time again for memories"

15
00:01:57,135 --> 00:02:01,594
"It's time again for swinging
under the boughs"

16
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:06,771
"Come home o'wanderer,
your heart beckons"

17
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:30,510
"The mute soil doesn't
read your letters"

18
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,507
"Come, kiss your soil, bring back
the earth to life"

19
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,520
"Yes, you have your dreams;
but we are yours too, your kin"

20
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,850
"You are so forgetful,
but we miss you so..."

21
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:54,030
"Come home o'wanderer,
your land beckons".

22
00:04:17,585 --> 00:04:19,552
Glory to The Goddess.

23
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:30,051
Yes Lajjo, I'm here safe and sound.
- Good.

24
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:50,909
Why is my little one giggling away?
- Mom! Every day for 20 years...

25
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:52,570
Dad has been walking down
the very same street...

26
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:56,740
to his very same destination.
Yet every day, you call him up...

27
00:04:57,284 --> 00:05:00,253
just to ask him, "Have you reached?"
- You won't understand.

28
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:06,919
Just assume it's a habit.
- Habit left unchanged...

29
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:11,926
tends to become necessity-like.
- Philosophy, again? You're twelve.

30
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,757
Talk like a 12-year old!
Why all this big talk?

31
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:19,595
There's no childhood, no adulthood.

32
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,770
One is as grown-up as one feels.

33
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,441
All right! I lose! Now go to school,
chew your teacher's brains, okay?

34
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:35,112
Why d'you forget
the almonds everyday?

35
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,617
What to do?
Just assume it's habit.

36
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,053
Will you get out?

37
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:02,964
"This is the first time
it's happening in 18 years"

38
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,966
"Some stranger I have never seen,
comes to my mind".

39
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,133
That's my diary!
- So what...?

40
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:11,312
Only I can read it.
- That was so funny.

41
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:14,642
Let me read some more.
- No way! This is a private diary.

42
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:18,481
Why hide anything from me?
When a girl is grown up...

43
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:21,644
her mother becomes her friend.
Show that to me.

44
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:24,649
You won't tell anyone, will you?
- Never.

45
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:30,320
All right. I'll read. You listen.
- Very well

46
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:43,994
"This is the first time
it's happening in 18 years"

47
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,669
"Some stranger I have never seen,
comes to my mind..."

48
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:54,674
"shadow-like before my eyes"

49
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,344
"Someone raps on my heart"

50
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:04,512
"Deep eyes want me to give myself up"

51
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,686
"When I look at my hands,
there I see a face etched"

52
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:14,029
"A silken breath brushes my cheeks"

53
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:18,689
"My hair still smells
of the odour on his hands"

54
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:24,362
"Yes, it's happening for
the first time in 18 years"

55
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,366
"I've never seen this stranger
who comes to my mind".

56
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:36,880
Simi, you've begun
writing quite well...

57
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:40,212
and the boy seems lively.
Who's he?

58
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:44,384
Ma, I've yet to set my eyes on him.

59
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:50,884
So there's no one? I was wondering.
One doesn't find such boys nowadays.

60
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:55,554
And you dream of someone
you haven't even seen! Quite mad.

61
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:01,733
No Ma. This is no dream.

62
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:07,230
I may not have met him, seen him.

63
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:12,739
But he's there. Out there, somewhere

64
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:45,762
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

65
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:49,773
"the one who teases me..."

66
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:02,784
"just ask him to face me, once"

67
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:54,328
"What's he like? Who is he?
Who knows where is the one..."

68
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,996
"my lips will say yes to?"

69
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,177
"Is he someone I know?
Is he a stranger?"

70
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:14,843
"Is he for real,
or just a legend?"

71
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,682
"He stares at me,
from far, far away"

72
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:24,011
"Tell him not to rob me
of my sleep"

73
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:27,854
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

74
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,858
"the one who teases me..."

75
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:36,521
"just ask him to face me, once"

76
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:11,721
"Some kind of spell is overcoming me"

77
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:23,901
"Oh what do I do?
My heart yearns so"

78
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:31,901
"My heart tells me it's mad for you.
Then why do you keep hiding from me?"

79
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,909
"He makes me blossom,
it's all his fault"

80
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:40,912
"Tell him, I'm asking for the Moon"

81
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:44,913
"The one who comes in my dreams..."

82
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:49,081
"the one who teases me..."

83
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,767
"just ask him to face me, once".

84
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,287
Raj! This partying all night!
Party all night and you don't sleep.

85
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:35,294
And how do you get up in the morning?
Late for graduation! Hurry!

86
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,972
Is it a holiday...?

87
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:53,312
What Raj...?
Late for your graduation?

88
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,647
What to do? Last night...

89
00:12:58,184 --> 00:13:00,152
What's wrong with him?
Has he had one too many beers?

90
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:03,652
I hear someone has failed.
The Dean has decided...

91
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:05,756
to announce his name in public.

92
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:40,515
You've made Dharamveer Malhotra stand
an inch and a half taller in his shoes!

93
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:49,015
I don't think you heard it right.
- I knew, someday you'd make me proud!

94
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,193
And not only me, the whole dynasty is
proud of you! Look, they smile at you.

95
00:13:56,066 --> 00:14:00,024
My great grandfather Diwan Brijnath
never went to school.

96
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:04,698
His son, my grandfather
Diwan Dwarkanath failed...

97
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,535
...his fourth standard examinations.
My father, your grandfather...

98
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:10,543
Diwan Pushkarnath, failed
his eighth standard examinations.

99
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,870
And I, your father,
failed to matriculate.

100
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,210
Not having an education, failing,
are family traditions. I'm happy...

101
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:21,717
that you have kept tradition alive,
and indeed you're two steps ahead.

102
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,048
We failed back home in India.
You came to London and failed!

103
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,392
Are you really happy?
- Glad.

104
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:36,391
Education is all useless.
Filling your head with books...

105
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:37,557
won't fill your pockets.

106
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:42,566
Look at me. Runaway peasant-boy from
Bhatinda-turned millionaire in London.

107
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:47,571
So, whatever happens is for the good.
Join my offices from tomorrow.

108
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:50,402
Offices? From tomorrow?
- Today, if you wish.

109
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:52,739
I can't attend office now.
- Why not?

110
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,577
Pops, you're a man of experience.

111
00:14:55,781 --> 00:15:00,582
You know what amount of hard work
it takes to fail. And I'm tired, Pops.

112
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,577
I want a little rest, you know,
like a long European holiday.

113
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:09,752
Long European holiday? How long?
- Month or month and a half.

114
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,090
Will you hold this for me?
And turn around.

115
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,758
Moron! Did I bring you up
to see this day?

116
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,943
No, don't drop that.

117
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,119
Are you all right, Pops?

118
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:51,292
Pops, you're right. I ought
to take care of your business.

119
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:55,623
You've become so old.
- You tell your father that?

120
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,970
Pops, I've decided against Europe.
I'm joining the offices from tomorrow.

121
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:09,975
In this house, only your father
decides. You're going to Europe.

122
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,972
No. I've had enough of a good time.
My years of youth are over for me.

123
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:18,480
Never say your youth is over.

124
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:27,814
All my life I've slogged to give
you whatever I couldn't do.

125
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:34,662
When youth came and went,
I never got to know.

126
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:40,992
But I wasn't sad, because I knew
that my son will have my years.

127
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:45,665
If you think you've had enough
of a good time...

128
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,498
if you think the years of youth
are over for you, well no problem.

129
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:56,174
Just go and live my years for me.

130
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,702
Ajit's letter?

131
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:32,204
Lajjo! Look, what's here
Letter! From my friend.

132
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:35,214
From Ajit.

133
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:37,715
Just smell it, lady!

134
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:41,716
The fragrance of Punjab!

135
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:45,722
The flavour of mustard curry
on leavened maize bread.

136
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:48,390
Those long tailed shirts,
the short knickers

137
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:54,893
"My dear friend Baldev,
We're fine here"

138
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:59,226
"We hope to God that you, your wife
and the children are well too"

139
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:03,066
"You will be pleased to hear that
my son has graduated in arts"

140
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:08,067
"He has joined my business.
By God's grace, it's time now...

141
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,070
for us to let our childhood
friendship mature into a relationship.

142
00:18:11,778 --> 00:18:16,908
Let's make good the promise we made
to each other 20 years ago. I hope...

143
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:20,916
you will come here at the soonest
for Simran's wedding to Kuljit.

144
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:23,751
Read on.

145
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:31,086
She's shy! See Lajjo?

146
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:34,591
That's our etiquette, our culture.

147
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:40,595
My daughter is still so shamefaced.
I'm not a failure.

148
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:45,432
In the heart of London,
I've kept India alive!

149
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:51,103
Still staring? Lajjo, your daughter's
wedding! Celebrate it with sweets.

150
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,603
Chutki! I'm so happy today.

151
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:57,111
Can I say one thing?
- Say four things

152
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:01,941
lt'd be better to ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?

153
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,281
Ever since she was a baby, she has
known that she is engaged to Kuljit.

154
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:10,118
That she knows. But 20 years...
- Don't you worry!

155
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:13,624
Simran is going to be so happy...

156
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:15,788
you'll pray that she never
gets the evil eye!

157
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:22,292
I'll write to Ajit right away.
God! At last, comes the day.

158
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:39,483
Simran, what are you doing?

159
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:46,311
I had forgotten, Ma. I haven't
even the right to dream.

160
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,149
No my child, of course
you may dream.

161
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:54,162
But don't expect them
to come true.

162
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,660
And who know, Kuljit might be
the man of your dreams.

163
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:04,837
I don't care.
I've bought your tickets.

164
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,006
You're coming to Europe with me
- I can't.

165
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,674
Babuji won't let me go to college
alone. Will he let me go away...

166
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,779
touring Europe for a month?

167
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,847
I have lots of work here.
- You've known me for years.

168
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,018
Can't you make up an excuse?

169
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,349
An excuse, I can find. But I don't
feel like lying to Babuji.

170
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,351
You must come. Dolly and Payal
are coming too.

171
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:37,026
Let me talk to Ma tonight.

172
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:40,863
Europe?
- Yes.

173
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:43,529
With friends?
- Yes.

174
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,139
For a month?
- Yes.

175
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:53,372
Chutki, call the doctor. Tell him
that our Simran has gone stark mad.

176
00:20:56,914 --> 00:21:00,213
Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first.

177
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:04,543
You talk of travelling by Eurail?
If he hears, he'll bring the roof down.

178
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:10,218
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
- Mom, I'm not going to be alone.

179
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:14,893
My friends are going to be with me.
- No good arguing with me.

180
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:18,399
I'm not going to object. But you
will need his permission.

181
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,735
Ask him when he's home.

182
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:26,740
God, please keep Babuji
in a nice mood.

183
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:52,421
It's just beer. It's over there.
- I told you. The store is shut.

184
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,764
Get out.

185
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:02,770
Got the beer?
- Didn't find any.

186
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,427
Can't even do such a simple job?
- That was an angry man.

187
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:09,105
I'll get it.
- You won't.

188
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:20,279
Can I have an Aspirin?
- The store is shut.

189
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:24,284
My head is about to crack up!
It's sinusitis.

190
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:25,945
If I can't find an Aspirin,
I'll faint.

191
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:28,123
All the other stores are shut.

192
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:33,957
Please let me have one Aspirin. One
Hindustani ought to help another.

193
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:49,971
Glory to The Goddess.
- Here you are.

194
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:59,313
I'm feeling bad about forcing you to
open your store for a small medicine.

195
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:03,475
I'd like to buy some other things
from you.

196
00:23:09,526 --> 00:23:11,823
I'll pick up some beer.
Not for myself.

197
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:14,495
My friends out there, they drink.

198
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:18,165
Put it down.
- Why sir?

199
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:22,495
Are you trying to con me? You aren't
getting anything. Put it down.

200
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:25,330
You're getting worked up
over nothing. This is for your profit.

201
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:29,497
Will you put it down?
- Not that umbrella.

202
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:35,836
Here you are. A pound extra?
No two. Keep it, okay?

203
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,175
Shameless!

204
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:44,017
You call yourself a Hindustani?
You give India a bad name.

205
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:47,686
You're a liar and insolent!
Get out of here.

206
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:53,024
I'm off. I'll keep this.

207
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:06,038
Rev up!

208
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:35,893
Babuji.

209
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:52,741
What is the matter? You're late.
- Bloody shameless scoundrel.

210
00:24:53,779 --> 00:25:00,240
They call themselves Hindustani! Blot
on India! Ought to drown themselves.

211
00:25:00,384 --> 00:25:05,912
Rascals! No shame, no decency.
How to respect their elders...

212
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:08,752
they don't even know.
- Have you had a fight?

213
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:16,091
Scum! He came for beer. I told him
the store is shut. He took it per force.

214
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:19,921
He even broke the statue of
The Goddess! Bloody half-caste!

215
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:24,266
I say Lajjo, thank God that
you and your daughters...

216
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,098
haven't been marred
by this Britishness!

217
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:29,435
Else, you would've been nowhere!

218
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:32,476
Damn these scoundrels!

219
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:41,114
Set sail in stormy waters, and
you're in danger of sinking.

220
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:38,158
You were so little when we brought
you here. And now...

221
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:43,332
They said that a grown-up daughter
is a burden on a man.

222
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:50,163
But a daughter like you, makes
a father's chest swell with pride!

223
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,679
You're my good girl.

224
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:04,176
Will you give something if I ask you?
- Whatever you wish.

225
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:09,187
I want to take a look at Europe.

226
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:19,696
Eurail is offering a month's tour.
All my friends are going.

227
00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:30,706
Please don't be cross. I have
never disobeyed you, Babuji.

228
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:36,377
I'll be going away to a land
I have never seen.

229
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:42,212
The man I'm going to marry
is a complete stranger. But...

230
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,049
I have no complaints. You must've
considered it in my best interests.

231
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:52,552
But I won't get a chance
like this ever again.

232
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:56,730
I don't even know whether
I'll ever come back...

233
00:27:57,765 --> 00:27:59,732
whether I will have
these friends later on.

234
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:07,566
Besides, it's only for a month. In
a month, I will have lived a lifetime.

235
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:16,243
For the sake of my happiness, won't
you let me have a month of my life?

236
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:23,416
Please Babuji, give me one month.

237
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:38,928
Go. Live it up.

238
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:45,270
My baby.

239
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,607
Where's Simran?

240
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:53,266
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?

241
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:57,440
I told you to wake up Raj
Did you?

242
00:28:58,482 --> 00:29:00,109
No.

243
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,830
Open sesame.

244
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,333
Do you have the keys to this?

245
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,841
Anybody home?

246
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,846
No one at home.

247
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:14,558
Haven't I seen you somewhere?

248
00:31:16,764 --> 00:31:18,731
At Robbie's party, no?

249
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,558
I don't go to parties.
- Great! Nor do I, ever.

250
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:40,074
Your eyes...

251
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:44,086
What's wrong with my eyes?

252
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:47,581
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?

253
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:55,418
My grandmother. Like you, her eyes
too had hues of yellows and blues.

254
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:15,945
Keep reading. I only wanted to find
out how you read upside-down.

255
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,947
This is the limit!

256
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:22,284
Simran, you're here?

257
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,448
I heard you've missed the train.
- No, I took it.

258
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,623
I was afraid...
- By the way, what's your name?

259
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,954
Sheena.

260
00:32:34,095 --> 00:32:38,292
Here I am. Shall we...?
- Take it easy.

261
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,976
Pump it up
- It's pumped. Look.

262
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,147
It's nothing.
- Raj, where have you been?

263
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,306
As usual. Caught up with a girl.

264
00:33:00,516 --> 00:33:03,973
Girl...?
- I help her onto the train.

265
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:06,154
And she falls for me.
- What...?

266
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:10,479
He bored me. He had me all alone,
and he began flirting.

267
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:13,653
Same old hat...
haven't I seen you before?

268
00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:16,330
She sidled up to me.
- What?

269
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:19,990
I was scared! Only so much space,
and there she was with me.

270
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:23,161
Then?
- Then what? She was lost in my eyes.

271
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:29,996
He was after my eyes. Wouldn't
shut up. Boys these days...

272
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:33,509
These girls! I just managed
to come out unscathed.

273
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:36,512
What's that?
- Invitation to a party.

274
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:10,363
I told you. It'll be a bore.
- You prophesied a train crash.

275
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:13,543
And then we'd all be charred alive
after supper in a dinner-hall fire.

276
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:16,375
Look, boys.
- Where...?

277
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:21,549
He's the one.

278
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,048
Where have we landed?
Was this your idea?

279
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:34,888
Us? or the waiters?
- For me.

280
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,897
Rocky shut your trap.

281
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:41,734
Why did you have to call him?

282
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:58,569
You know Sheena, haven't
I seen you before?

283
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:03,741
Me? Really? Where?
- At Robbie's party?

284
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,418
You might've.
I go to so many parties.

285
00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:13,693
You know Sheena...
- What?

286
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:19,588
Your eyes remind me of someone.
- My eyes? Really? Whom?

287
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:22,600
My grandmother.

288
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:34,104
Is she singing or crying?
And I can play better piano.

289
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:36,279
You know how to play the piano?

290
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:43,111
I was born on a piano. Been playing
the piano ever since I was a baby.

291
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:49,612
You know, I've magic in my fingers.
No sooner than I touch the piano...

292
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:52,126
it starts playing.

293
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:04,131
Isn't that voice familiar?

294
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:36,496
Was this necessary?

295
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:43,156
Doesn't the magic in your fingers
make pianos start playing?

296
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:37,811
"Stop, my wild lover"

297
00:39:38,848 --> 00:39:41,475
"I've got to ask you something"

298
00:39:43,585 --> 00:39:46,484
"What are you, girl or magic?"

299
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:50,322
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

300
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:14,332
"Come, let me touch you"

301
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:17,839
"Wait, my wild love"

302
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:22,183
"I've got to ask you something"

303
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,038
"Look at me, smiling, unknowing"

304
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:05,544
"I'm waiting for you,
holding my heart"

305
00:41:07,087 --> 00:41:10,716
"She looks subdued"

306
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:14,560
"But she has lots to say"

307
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:19,894
"If you say yes,
I have something to say"

308
00:41:20,632 --> 00:41:23,396
"Wait, my wild love"

309
00:41:25,102 --> 00:41:27,400
"I've got to ask you something"

310
00:41:29,774 --> 00:41:32,742
"What are you, girl or magic?"

311
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:36,905
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

312
00:42:03,635 --> 00:42:07,264
"You aren't the only
pretty woman around"

313
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:10,940
"Why are you the only one
who's cross?"

314
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:20,112
"The one I've fallen for,
is someone else"

315
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:25,445
"If she says yes,
I'll take her in my arms"

316
00:42:26,353 --> 00:42:28,946
"Wait, my wild love"

317
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:32,951
"I've got to ask you something"

318
00:42:34,994 --> 00:42:38,292
"What are you, girl or magic?"

319
00:42:39,832 --> 00:42:42,300
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"

320
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:47,968
"Come, let me touch you".

321
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:43,346
About last night, I'm ashamed.

322
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,519
I misbehaved with you.

323
00:44:14,743 --> 00:44:17,871
I wanted to tell you something else.

324
00:44:18,914 --> 00:44:20,882
What...?
- This.

325
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:23,876
Run.

326
00:44:45,937 --> 00:44:47,904
First come, first served.

327
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:54,405
Hurry! The train is about to leave.
- Where did I keep my money?

328
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:02,572
One minute, I don't know how to count
this currency... lots of small change.

329
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:07,575
Can you tell me one,
two's, eighths...?

330
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:14,927
Stop.

331
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:23,597
Train's gone?

332
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:31,607
The train is gone!

333
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,778
Don't cry, Senorita.

334
00:45:41,983 --> 00:45:43,951
But you just stopped crying.

335
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:49,452
It's raining! Don't cry, please!
I'm with you, I'm here! Look.

336
00:45:51,491 --> 00:45:56,120
Okay, I'm gone... gone!
Here's your bell.

337
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:18,813
The next train is very late.
To catch up with the train...

338
00:46:18,947 --> 00:46:23,645
at Zurich tomorrow morning, we can
either take a bus or hire a car.

339
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:26,816
What would be your pleasure?
Bus or car? Where's she?

340
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,488
Ever since you met me,
you've been harassing me.

341
00:46:33,693 --> 00:46:35,990
What are you saying?
- All along the trip...

342
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:37,823
you've been chewing my brains.
- I...?

343
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,658
Something's always the problem
with you. Today, I've missed...

344
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,493
the train, thanks to you.
- To me...?

345
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:48,832
I wish to make it to Zurich on time.
So you go your way, I'll go mine.

346
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,499
Strange! We're fellow-travellers,
on the same destination, same train.

347
00:46:54,710 --> 00:47:00,170
Why split up? Besides, a man like me
ought to stay with a girl like you.

348
00:47:00,314 --> 00:47:07,685
Wrong! A girl like me doesn't need
a guy like you. Stop pursuing me.

349
00:47:20,898 --> 00:47:24,698
I'll sew it up. I have a thread and
needle. I'll buy you a new dress.

350
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:44,100
What have you got yourself into?

351
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,288
I told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?

352
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,118
What do you think of yourself?
I wasn't pursuing you.

353
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,626
And I don't fancy touching you. Thank
your stars I came in the nick of time.

354
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:22,128
Else, you would've been in jail.
I help her, and she says this.

355
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:24,234
Hey, take her away.

356
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:14,009
What did you say?

357
00:50:16,878 --> 00:50:18,175
I got carried away.

358
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:24,840
Never mind Senorita, never mind. In
big places, such small things happen.

359
00:50:26,385 --> 00:50:32,186
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain.

360
00:50:34,893 --> 00:50:39,852
Why did you dump her?
- She hated Indians.

361
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:48,029
You like Indians, don't you?
- When do we reach Zurich?

362
00:50:48,738 --> 00:50:51,865
What's in Zurich?
This is the real Europe.

363
00:50:53,408 --> 00:50:58,868
So beautiful, so pretty. Sometimes,
I fear, it might become dirty.

364
00:51:00,915 --> 00:51:03,213
Here for the first time?
- Yes.

365
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,548
Will you drive faster?
- What's the hurry Senorita?

366
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:11,383
Train leaves Zurich at 11:30 tomorrow.
We have a whole night and half a day.

367
00:51:11,923 --> 00:51:13,891
We'll be there on time.
- Still, if we could...

368
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,557
What had to happen, has happened.
Now you're with me.

369
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:20,897
Nothing can go wrong.

370
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:37,912
Europe is best done on foot.

371
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,419
Just the four of us.
Chutki is way ahead of her years.

372
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:58,259
And Ma's more a friend than a mother.
So I never felt the need for a friend.

373
00:52:01,298 --> 00:52:06,258
You can't live the rest of your life
with friends. Sometime or the other...

374
00:52:06,469 --> 00:52:10,928
you will need someone who will
walk by you all your life.

375
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,437
Can't walk anymore. I'm tired.
- Do I pick you up in my arms?

376
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:24,614
I can't afford a hotel. Let's try
that house. We might find lodgings.

377
00:52:34,326 --> 00:52:36,953
Come. Arrangements for the night
is done.

378
00:52:44,634 --> 00:52:46,602
Which is your room?

379
00:52:49,472 --> 00:52:52,929
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room.

380
00:52:55,477 --> 00:52:59,104
And we spend the night in the same
room? You presume somewhat like that?

381
00:52:59,813 --> 00:53:02,782
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling.

382
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:07,615
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed. I'll take the sofa.

383
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,947
No problems.
- No way. I'm leaving.

384
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:16,950
I'm not joking. I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?

385
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,665
So nice... so romantic!

386
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,669
And these curtains... so nice!

387
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,675
And the view!

388
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:19,338
No horses?

389
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,347
It's so warm in here.

390
00:54:23,382 --> 00:54:26,010
There! You have a fire going.

391
00:54:28,721 --> 00:54:33,020
Granted. You have a great sense
of choice.

392
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,689
You couldn't find a better place
to spend the night, right?

393
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,368
We were getting a nice room.

394
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:51,027
But you'd rather spend the night
with me in the stables. Not in the room.

395
00:54:54,909 --> 00:54:58,366
Eat
- I'm not hungry.

396
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:05,205
All right. Don't eat.
How am I bothered?

397
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:43,749
Eat it.

398
00:55:45,284 --> 00:55:47,251
I told you. I'm not hungry.

399
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:50,755
Come on now. Eat.

400
00:55:55,793 --> 00:55:57,761
What did you say?

401
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,767
I got carried away.

402
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:12,773
Never mind. In big places,
such small things happen.

403
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:18,935
You were right, Senorita.
The spirit of adventure in this barn...

404
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:23,775
you could never enjoy in that room.
- But how do we get to Zurich?

405
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:29,115
No, not Zurich. Tomorrow evening, we
entrain at Berne. Tomorrow morning...

406
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:32,121
we take the first bus at eight.
I've found out everything.

407
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,457
Now, nothing can go wrong.

408
00:57:06,351 --> 00:57:08,649
What's that?
- Life.

409
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:14,992
Aren't you ashamed to drink
in the presence of a lady?

410
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:19,158
Better than dying before the lady!
If you wish to live on...

411
00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:22,827
you too should have a bit, Senorita.
- Don't you dare come near me.

412
00:57:23,699 --> 00:57:25,667
All right, don't.

413
00:57:38,879 --> 00:57:42,507
I'll see you tomorrow morning if
you're still alive.

414
00:57:43,215 --> 00:57:45,183
Until then, goodnight

415
00:58:41,597 --> 00:58:44,565
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

416
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:48,235
"May I try a pirouette?
- Oh no!"

417
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:52,068
"How about a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

418
00:58:52,439 --> 00:58:56,899
"Let me fly with the wind"

419
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:04,079
"God! Help me"

420
01:00:02,664 --> 01:00:08,466
"The chill in the breeze
sets my body afire"

421
01:00:09,837 --> 01:00:12,465
"I feel like..."

422
01:00:13,841 --> 01:00:15,967
"making love to you"

423
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,138
"This never happened before"

424
01:00:20,346 --> 01:00:23,803
"I've taken my first step"

425
01:00:24,349 --> 01:00:28,649
"Let me fly with the wind"

426
01:00:31,354 --> 01:00:35,984
"God! Help me"

427
01:00:39,028 --> 01:00:42,327
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

428
01:00:42,865 --> 01:00:45,992
"May I try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"

429
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:49,666
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

430
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:22,030
"Where do you think you're going,
my darling, my love...?"

431
01:01:23,398 --> 01:01:29,199
"You're a pretty girl.
I'm a handsome young man"

432
01:01:30,738 --> 01:01:33,706
"Come into my embrace"

433
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:37,367
"Let me hold you in my eyes"

434
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:42,212
"Oh, I'm drunk"

435
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:49,718
"God! Help me"

436
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:55,885
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"

437
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:59,553
"May I try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"

438
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,893
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"

439
01:02:03,198 --> 01:02:07,726
"Oh, I'm ecstatic"

440
01:02:10,771 --> 01:02:15,401
"God! Help me".

441
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,951
Up in the mornings,
you look even prettier.

442
01:03:27,335 --> 01:03:29,303
How did I get here?

443
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:33,802
With me. Last night.

444
01:03:35,675 --> 01:03:37,642
I don't think you've ever
had a drink before.

445
01:03:40,012 --> 01:03:41,979
And you had one too many.

446
01:03:43,181 --> 01:03:44,648
Have this.

447
01:03:46,517 --> 01:03:48,484
What happened last night?

448
01:03:51,188 --> 01:03:57,490
What happened last night,
was bound to happen.

449
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:04,157
But I didn't imagine
it'd happen this way.

450
01:04:05,533 --> 01:04:08,502
Tell me the truth, Raj!
What happened last night?

451
01:04:09,536 --> 01:04:11,504
How do I answer
this question, Simran?

452
01:04:13,374 --> 01:04:19,675
Look, look into my eyes.
Aren't my eyes telling the truth?

453
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:25,349
No! This could never have happened.

454
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:31,184
This could never have happened.
- That's exactly what happened, Simran.

455
01:04:34,057 --> 01:04:36,025
Who can stop what is to happen?

456
01:04:37,393 --> 01:04:40,191
You're lying!
You're lying, aren't you?

457
01:04:40,396 --> 01:04:42,864
No Simran.
- Please tell me you're lying.

458
01:04:44,299 --> 01:04:49,202
Granted! I'm lying,
my eyes are lying.

459
01:04:50,905 --> 01:04:52,871
But are these love-bites lying?

460
01:04:55,074 --> 01:04:56,041
Speak.

461
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:00,533
Tell me Simran! Are these yours?
Or someone else's?

462
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:04,043
Don't cry! I was just joking.

463
01:05:04,249 --> 01:05:07,877
Those aren't real! Look!
I used your lipstick.

464
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:13,885
You only had one too many,
and you were dripping wet.

465
01:05:14,023 --> 01:05:17,220
I had no options. I had to bring
you here. I swear, I'm just joking.

466
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,217
You were all alone on the bed. I slept
out there. I'm just joking! I swear.

467
01:05:21,363 --> 01:05:23,228
Don't cry, don't.

468
01:05:30,271 --> 01:05:37,573
I know what you think of me.
You think I'm a wastrel.

469
01:05:40,112 --> 01:05:45,572
I'm not scum, Simran.
I'm Hindustani.

470
01:05:47,118 --> 01:05:50,245
And I know what honour means
for the Hindustani woman.

471
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:57,753
Not even in my dreams can I imagine
doing that to you. Trust me, Simran.

472
01:05:58,461 --> 01:06:05,593
I'm saying the truth. Last night,
nothing happened. Just a joke.

473
01:06:16,641 --> 01:06:20,441
Please, never joke about that.
You don't know what I would've done.

474
01:06:21,146 --> 01:06:23,113
Please, no jokes like that.

475
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,448
I promise never to crack
a joke like that.

476
01:06:52,505 --> 01:06:55,303
Get changed. Fast.
We got to catch the bus.

477
01:06:56,509 --> 01:06:58,476
May I have my shirt back?

478
01:07:17,026 --> 01:07:19,994
Fifteen minutes before the bus
leaves. You want to eat something?

479
01:07:22,197 --> 01:07:24,164
No, I'm not hungry.

480
01:07:31,037 --> 01:07:34,164
Come on, let's take a look inside.
- Churches aren't worth a look.

481
01:07:34,306 --> 01:07:36,274
I'm not going.

482
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:43,180
Go on. Take a look.

483
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:25,044
What?
- Hurry up. We'll miss the bus.

484
01:09:00,945 --> 01:09:04,904
Shall we?
- Why not leave after tea?

485
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:14,419
What did you ask for?
- You aren't supposed to speak of it.

486
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:18,088
Then you must be sure about
being given what you've asked for.

487
01:09:19,461 --> 01:09:23,590
Whatever one seeks with a pure heart,
one is surely given.

488
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:29,101
Go on. I'll be back in a minute.
- What happened?

489
01:09:29,302 --> 01:09:31,270
Go on. I'll join you.

490
01:09:44,482 --> 01:09:46,450
I'm Raj.

491
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:52,452
I'm sorry, I don't know how to pray.
But I want nothing for myself.

492
01:09:54,490 --> 01:10:00,621
But that girl Simran, she's nice.
Very good at heart.

493
01:10:01,663 --> 01:10:04,130
Give her whatever she asked for.

494
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:21,312
Where have you been?

495
01:10:23,847 --> 01:10:25,815
In the church?

496
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:40,657
Half a teaspoon of sugar, one spoon
of milk, bit of cream. Your coffee.

497
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:45,660
You want a postcard to send home?
- Postcard? For home?

498
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:49,657
If that postcard reaches home,
my Pop will give me up for dead.

499
01:10:51,204 --> 01:10:53,171
When were you last serious?
- Till now, never.

500
01:10:53,539 --> 01:10:56,337
If ever, it'll happen only once.
- When?

501
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,177
When I'm in love.

502
01:11:01,212 --> 01:11:04,670
A boy like you was never in love?
- I've had many affairs.

503
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:09,007
But I was never in love, Senorita.
Never found one.

504
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:11,687
What kind of girl are
you looking for?

505
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:14,855
Want me to tell you?

506
01:11:16,224 --> 01:11:18,522
The moment I look at her...

507
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:23,187
all my heart's desires, all my
dreams will come alive.

508
01:11:25,065 --> 01:11:30,696
Has never happened. But now I hear
a voice, behind the clouds, calling.

509
01:11:32,572 --> 01:11:40,205
She's a stranger, a face I've never
seen before. When will the clouds part?

510
01:11:45,249 --> 01:11:48,705
Has it never happened with you?
- No.

511
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:53,210
No stranger ever invaded your dreams?

512
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:57,387
No place for strangers in my dreams.

513
01:12:00,928 --> 01:12:02,554
I am engaged to marry.

514
01:12:08,435 --> 01:12:11,062
Engaged to marry?
- Yes.

515
01:12:13,105 --> 01:12:16,403
Where's the fiance? In London?
- No, in India.

516
01:12:16,608 --> 01:12:18,235
Looks...?

517
01:12:19,611 --> 01:12:22,239
Don't know. Never seen him.

518
01:12:24,782 --> 01:12:28,740
You've never seen the man
you're going to marry?

519
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:34,248
Not necessary. My father has
seen him. His friend's son.

520
01:12:36,124 --> 01:12:43,427
You'll spend your life with someone
you've never met?

521
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:47,266
A complete stranger?

522
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:55,771
That's how it happens with us.
- And you're happy with this decision?

523
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:09,951
The train is here.

524
01:13:54,022 --> 01:14:00,824
Lovely photographs. Send me a set of
copies. And your wedding photos too.

525
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:04,652
Won't you be there at my wedding?
- Who's going to travel so far?

526
01:14:05,031 --> 01:14:09,331
Sheena, you must!
- Just joking. Of course, I'll come.

527
01:14:09,702 --> 01:14:14,503
I got to take a look at your groom.
Who knows what idiot she's marrying?

528
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,178
You dropped this.

529
01:14:59,476 --> 01:15:01,706
What happened? Why are you
staring like that?

530
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,207
I have something to tell you Simran.

531
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:08,550
Go on.

532
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,888
I'm in love with you.

533
01:15:32,939 --> 01:15:34,905
Just look at your face.

534
01:15:37,274 --> 01:15:39,242
You thought I was saying the truth?

535
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:44,409
Strange Simran!
You've known me for so long...

536
01:15:44,547 --> 01:15:50,246
and you still can't make me out?
Remember? I've never been serious.

537
01:15:54,122 --> 01:15:59,081
All this love etc. is beyond me.
Still haven't been able to make out...

538
01:15:59,627 --> 01:16:05,258
how some men spend a lifetime with one
girl! It's a world full of pretty women.

539
01:16:06,132 --> 01:16:10,431
Someone has beautiful eyes, someone has
good lips, someone has nice hair...

540
01:16:10,803 --> 01:16:16,762
You boys are all the same.
- But you're one up on all of us.

541
01:16:18,475 --> 01:16:25,437
You're about to spend a lifetime
with someone you haven't even seen.

542
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:30,777
That must be true love.

543
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:42,789
Forget it. Think for a moment,
what if you're in love with someone?

544
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:46,962
I mean, imagine you're in love with
someone you've met on this trip...

545
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:52,132
why someone? Say you're in love
with me, and I'm in love with you too.

546
01:16:56,007 --> 01:17:02,468
Then what will you do? Will you
go back to marry that stranger?

547
01:17:04,514 --> 01:17:07,812
Or, will you have the courage
to have an affair with me?

548
01:17:11,687 --> 01:17:13,654
What will you do?

549
01:17:22,696 --> 01:17:27,495
I don't want to miss the train again.
- I want to miss it again and again.

550
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:31,328
What...?
- Nothing.

551
01:17:36,874 --> 01:17:40,833
If she's in love with me,
she's going to turn around.

552
01:17:45,548 --> 01:17:46,515
Turn.

553
01:17:53,555 --> 01:17:54,522
Turn.

554
01:18:44,097 --> 01:18:48,226
Back in London. How a month
passed by, I didn't even notice.

555
01:19:14,789 --> 01:19:20,249
Raj, you haven't given me your address.
I'll send you my wedding invitation.

556
01:19:20,626 --> 01:19:22,594
You'll come, won't you?

557
01:19:24,797 --> 01:19:26,765
No, I won't come

558
01:19:54,990 --> 01:20:00,620
"What's come over..."

559
01:20:02,828 --> 01:20:04,796
"my heart?"

560
01:20:06,999 --> 01:20:14,632
"Have I lost it?"

561
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:22,301
"What's come over my heart?"

562
01:20:24,346 --> 01:20:29,648
"Where have I lost it?"

563
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:50,331
"You're in love, my love"

564
01:20:51,536 --> 01:20:54,993
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

565
01:20:56,307 --> 01:21:00,174
"You're in love, my love"

566
01:21:01,044 --> 01:21:04,844
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

567
01:21:05,548 --> 01:21:09,506
"Darling, this is love"

568
01:21:20,293 --> 01:21:24,023
"You're in love, my love"

569
01:21:25,064 --> 01:21:28,863
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

570
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:33,700
"Darling, this is love"

571
01:21:58,925 --> 01:22:03,054
"You didn't care to turn around..."

572
01:22:03,762 --> 01:22:06,731
"but I was still waiting"

573
01:22:08,433 --> 01:22:12,732
"By the time I wanted
to stop you..."

574
01:22:13,437 --> 01:22:16,406
"you were too far away"

575
01:22:17,607 --> 01:22:21,236
"What happened?
- I don't even know"

576
01:22:22,445 --> 01:22:25,902
"Why is my heart...
- In love...?"

577
01:22:27,283 --> 01:22:31,240
"You're in love, my love"

578
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:36,078
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

579
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:40,748
"You're in love, my love"

580
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:45,760
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"

581
01:22:46,298 --> 01:22:50,428
"Darling, this is love"

582
01:23:24,997 --> 01:23:29,126
"Oh time! Stop, tarry..."

583
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:32,803
"go backwards"

584
01:23:34,572 --> 01:23:38,632
"I've left myself behind..."

585
01:23:39,576 --> 01:23:42,305
"at the crossroads of life"

586
01:23:43,578 --> 01:23:47,139
"Where am I...?
- Where are you?"

587
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:51,807
"What is this...?
- Magic"

588
01:23:53,287 --> 01:23:57,313
"You're in love, my love"

589
01:23:58,191 --> 01:24:01,820
"Try refusing a million times,
"You're in love, my love"

590
01:24:08,033 --> 01:24:11,832
"Try refusing a million times,
"You're in love, my love"

591
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:16,500
"Darling, this is love"

592
01:24:52,569 --> 01:24:57,370
"What's come over..."

593
01:24:59,409 --> 01:25:01,376
"my heart?"

594
01:25:03,745 --> 01:25:07,874
"My heart was with me always"

595
01:25:08,082 --> 01:25:11,882
"Have I lost it?"

596
01:25:14,087 --> 01:25:16,055
"I've lost it".

597
01:25:34,938 --> 01:25:37,735
Ma, you remember the dream
I wrote about in my diary?

598
01:25:39,442 --> 01:25:42,569
That face I imagined
holding in my hands?

599
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:46,247
The one, I wanted to face.

600
01:25:48,116 --> 01:25:50,242
I've found him.

601
01:25:51,452 --> 01:25:53,420
What...?

602
01:25:54,121 --> 01:25:58,921
What are you saying, Simi?
- Yes Ma. When I was leaving...

603
01:25:59,058 --> 01:26:01,424
I was clear about what
I was getting out of life.

604
01:26:02,128 --> 01:26:07,087
For a month, I wanted to be as happy
as I could. Then I'd come back...

605
01:26:07,632 --> 01:26:12,261
and go away to my country to spend
a lifetime with a stranger.

606
01:26:13,137 --> 01:26:18,266
I had come to a compromise with my
destiny, Ma. But little did I know...

607
01:26:19,141 --> 01:26:23,441
this was in store for me.
Like a storm he came...

608
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:27,110
and he swept me off
like a fallen leaf.

609
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:34,609
Love's like this, like that,
I had read, I had heard.

610
01:26:35,489 --> 01:26:40,790
But I never understood. When, for the
first time, he offered me his hand...

611
01:26:40,926 --> 01:26:44,794
I still didn't understand.
I was with him for so long...

612
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:52,466
still I didn't understand anything.
But today, when we were leaving each other...

613
01:26:54,003 --> 01:26:58,463
for the first time I felt
that after this moment...

614
01:26:59,342 --> 01:27:05,644
I'm not going to see him ever again.
I kept looking back. He was going away.

615
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:11,807
I wanted to stop him, I wanted to say
something, I wanted to hear something.

616
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:19,151
But he didn't stop. I understood.
This is what love is like.

617
01:27:21,026 --> 01:27:27,829
And to him, I've given all my dreams.
I don't even know whether he loves me.

618
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:35,000
All I know is that for me, he's life.
I can never be anyone else's, Ma.

619
01:27:52,553 --> 01:27:55,351
You're up? Simi and I
have been talking.

620
01:27:55,889 --> 01:27:58,857
She's back after so long.
I even lost track of time.

621
01:28:15,572 --> 01:28:20,031
I told you, not to betray my trust.

622
01:28:23,078 --> 01:28:28,037
I took a promise from you.
And you've deceived me?

623
01:28:28,749 --> 01:28:31,047
No Babuji...
- Listen, first ask her.

624
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:33,219
I don't want to listen to anything!

625
01:28:35,589 --> 01:28:40,048
Pack. Tomorrow morning,
we leave for India.

626
01:28:42,261 --> 01:28:43,728
For good.

627
01:28:49,933 --> 01:28:51,901
Let her cry.

628
01:28:52,436 --> 01:28:54,903
She has writ it on her own destiny.

629
01:28:56,272 --> 01:28:59,900
She will have to learn for herself
how to get over it. Let her cry.

630
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,608
What's her name?
- Simran.

631
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,278
What girl, Pops?

632
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:47,941
The one whose face you see
in the moon.

633
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,447
I'm not one of them...

634
01:29:51,585 --> 01:29:54,281
who will go crazy about a girl.
- Yes, I forgot!

635
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:57,452
Some have good lips, some have
beautiful eyes...

636
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:03,127
Lives where?
- Who, Pops?

637
01:30:05,162 --> 01:30:07,130
This... Simran.

638
01:30:12,502 --> 01:30:16,131
Don't know
- How is she?

639
01:30:17,839 --> 01:30:19,807
Very lovable.

640
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:23,478
Then what's the problem?

641
01:30:24,512 --> 01:30:30,144
Problem is, she's about to marry.
- How about stopping the wedding?

642
01:30:32,352 --> 01:30:35,480
In your time, it was different.
Times have changed.

643
01:30:37,691 --> 01:30:42,820
Love is still called "love". That has
never changed, nor will it ever change.

644
01:30:45,862 --> 01:30:49,662
She's going to be someone else's.
- The bride goes to the man...

645
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:56,170
who brings her home. I didn't sire
you to play that fiddle. We aren't...

646
01:30:56,305 --> 01:30:58,273
those who stare at the moon. You
reach out to the moon...

647
01:30:58,407 --> 01:31:00,374
you bring her home. Go.

648
01:31:01,376 --> 01:31:04,174
And come home only
with your bride. Get it?

649
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:51,213
Gone. The daughter is
getting married.

650
01:31:51,418 --> 01:31:53,385
They've sold out and moved to Punjab.

651
01:32:22,444 --> 01:32:24,412
I'm coming, Simran.

652
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,248
I'm coming

653
01:33:30,066 --> 01:33:35,129
"When the girls go to the riverbank,
you'll hear their anklets chime"

654
01:33:35,671 --> 01:33:38,139
"When the ripe mustard sways
in the farms..."

655
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:40,467
"you'll know a year
has come to pass"

656
01:33:42,844 --> 01:33:47,803
"Come today, come with a smile,
bring me a song, I've been waiting..."

657
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:52,808
"for the whistle
of the chugging train"

658
01:33:53,853 --> 01:33:58,152
"Come home o'wanderer,
your mate beckons"

659
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:01,158
"Come home o'wanderer"

660
01:34:05,195 --> 01:34:08,323
"Your land beckons".

661
01:34:28,882 --> 01:34:30,850
Bless me, Ma-ji.

662
01:34:40,391 --> 01:34:42,518
No Ma-ji.

663
01:34:45,563 --> 01:34:52,365
Son, 20 years I've held back
these tears.

664
01:34:56,739 --> 01:35:01,368
Today, they won't stop, son.
Not today.

665
01:35:07,914 --> 01:35:09,882
Simran, my child.

666
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:12,384
My baby doll.

667
01:35:17,088 --> 01:35:19,886
How have you been?
- I haven't changed a bit!

668
01:35:20,425 --> 01:35:24,724
You're the bride's aunt now!
Time to find a good groom for yourself.

669
01:35:24,929 --> 01:35:27,898
Lajjo, I've been ready all these years!
But in this village...

670
01:35:28,032 --> 01:35:32,058
there isn't one who's a match for me.
So what do I do? For me, I think...

671
01:35:32,202 --> 01:35:36,069
it'll have to be a foreigner!
- You haven't changed a bit.

672
01:35:36,205 --> 01:35:37,900
Not a bit!

673
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:42,898
You did keep us waiting.
Anyway, better late than never.

674
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:46,237
Wife, will you excuse us a moment?
- Get lost.

675
01:35:50,115 --> 01:35:53,084
Come on. Baldev, who's this?
Go on...

676
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:57,246
You don't know?
My daughter Preeti.

677
01:35:57,622 --> 01:36:00,921
Kuljit's sister.
- May you live long.

678
01:36:02,794 --> 01:36:06,251
Wonderful, isn't it? In 20 years,
the whole generation has come of age.

679
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:09,098
She's beautiful.
- Father's daughter, right?

680
01:36:09,233 --> 01:36:10,756
Get lost.

681
01:36:11,133 --> 01:36:12,760
Where's Kuljit?
- Yes, where's Kuljit?

682
01:36:13,135 --> 01:36:15,763
Bhaiyya (Brother) is out for a hunt.
He should be back soon.

683
01:36:40,258 --> 01:36:42,226
My respects.
- May you live long, son.

684
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:44,628
My respects.
- May you live long, son.

685
01:36:46,663 --> 01:36:50,793
That's a strong lad from Punjab.
- Whose son is he anyway?

686
01:36:51,001 --> 01:36:52,468
Get lost.

687
01:36:52,669 --> 01:36:55,636
Come, breakfast is ready.
- Yes hurry. I'm famished.

688
01:36:55,837 --> 01:36:57,805
Come on kids.

689
01:36:58,172 --> 01:37:02,471
For you, for you and for you.

690
01:37:02,843 --> 01:37:04,811
You must take me out
tomorrow morning.

691
01:37:05,178 --> 01:37:06,805
Sure Didi (Sister).

692
01:37:36,537 --> 01:37:38,835
Kids, Grannie wants
everyone downstairs.

693
01:37:59,891 --> 01:38:05,522
You know Simi, when I was a kid,
my father would tell me...

694
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:13,190
there's no difference between
man and woman. All have equal rights.

695
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:20,200
All my childhood, I lived believing
it's true. But as I grew up...

696
01:38:21,742 --> 01:38:23,869
I realised what a lie that is.

697
01:38:26,746 --> 01:38:29,874
I wasn't given an education,
because it was more important...

698
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:34,213
that my brothers be educated.
That was my first sacrifice.

699
01:38:36,254 --> 01:38:40,553
Then, at every step, sometimes
as daughter, sometimes as sister...

700
01:38:41,258 --> 01:38:43,726
sometimes as wife... I went on
sacrificing my own happiness.

701
01:38:46,763 --> 01:38:48,730
But once you were born...

702
01:38:49,765 --> 01:38:52,393
when I held you in my hands
for the first time...

703
01:38:53,935 --> 01:39:01,739
I made a promise, never to let happen
to my daughter, what happened to me.

704
01:39:03,777 --> 01:39:08,577
No more sacrifices at every step
as daughter, as sister, as wife.

705
01:39:10,116 --> 01:39:14,416
So what if she's a girl?
She'd live her life as she wishes.

706
01:39:15,453 --> 01:39:20,584
She'd have her share of happiness.
But I was wrong, Simran.

707
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:26,091
I had even forgotten that a woman
hasn't even the right to make promises.

708
01:39:27,797 --> 01:39:34,099
She is born to be sacrificed for
their men. For their women...

709
01:39:34,236 --> 01:39:38,103
men will never make sacrifices,
nor will they ever make sacrifices.

710
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:44,933
Therefore I, your mother, come to
take from you, your own happiness.

711
01:39:47,814 --> 01:39:54,776
Forget him, my child. Forget. Because
your father won't care for your tears.

712
01:39:57,321 --> 01:39:59,289
For the happiness of everyone...

713
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:04,957
I beg of you. Forget him, my child.

714
01:40:24,845 --> 01:40:26,812
You're right, Ma.

715
01:40:27,847 --> 01:40:35,150
So naive of me. I don't even know
whether he loves me.

716
01:40:37,355 --> 01:40:42,655
And after all, Babuji is my father.
He has always cared for my happiness.

717
01:40:45,695 --> 01:40:49,494
For the sake of his happiness,
can I not make this little sacrifice?

718
01:40:52,367 --> 01:40:58,999
Go Ma, go and tell Babuji that
I'm ready for the wedding.

719
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:03,843
He won't have any problems
from my end.

720
01:41:50,582 --> 01:41:54,211
Your girl is beautiful.

721
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:58,376
Not the girl. Kuljit is plain lucky.

722
01:42:05,094 --> 01:42:09,224
And my name is Rajeshwari.
Miss Rajeshwari Singh.

723
01:42:10,099 --> 01:42:14,228
If the little one is like this,
what will the older one be like?

724
01:42:15,103 --> 01:42:18,072
I'll tell you, after the wedding.

725
01:42:19,706 --> 01:42:21,901
Listen.

726
01:42:22,943 --> 01:42:24,911
The day after tomorrow is the
engagement.

727
01:42:25,045 --> 01:42:27,012
The wedding is on the 25th.

728
01:42:31,784 --> 01:42:33,410
Sweets.

729
01:43:22,658 --> 01:43:24,626
I'm worried about something.

730
01:43:25,995 --> 01:43:31,955
I don't know why I see this
sadness in Simran's eyes.

731
01:43:33,501 --> 01:43:38,802
Even her smile is hesitant.
Is everything all right?

732
01:43:40,174 --> 01:43:41,801
It's nothing, Ma.

733
01:43:42,009 --> 01:43:48,811
It's a new place, it's a change.
In a few days, she'll adjust.

734
01:43:49,514 --> 01:43:51,481
Don't worry for nothing.

735
01:43:53,351 --> 01:43:54,978
Here you are, kheer.

736
01:43:58,021 --> 01:44:03,653
Simran hasn't forgotten him yet?
- She has agreed to get married.

737
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:09,992
By and by she will forget everything.
- If she remembers, she'll regret it

738
01:45:20,924 --> 01:45:26,725
"When I saw you, I realised..."

739
01:45:33,868 --> 01:45:38,895
"what madness love is"

740
01:46:34,985 --> 01:46:38,284
"When I saw you, I realised..."

741
01:46:39,989 --> 01:46:43,288
"what madness love is"

742
01:46:55,002 --> 01:46:58,630
"From here, where to?"

743
01:47:00,173 --> 01:47:03,630
"Just let me die in your arms"

744
01:48:04,227 --> 01:48:08,185
"My eyes...
dream of you"

745
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:11,028
"My heart holds memories of you"

746
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:18,030
"Nothing's mine.
It's all yours"

747
01:48:19,238 --> 01:48:21,206
"My life, my breath is yours"

748
01:48:23,742 --> 01:48:27,541
"When I weep for you, your tears..."

749
01:48:28,813 --> 01:48:32,044
"my sorrows begin to smile"

750
01:48:33,584 --> 01:48:37,042
"I saw you, I realised..."

751
01:48:38,755 --> 01:48:42,383
"what madness love is"

752
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:47,386
"From here, where to?"

753
01:48:49,097 --> 01:48:52,395
"Just let me die in your arms"

754
01:49:20,123 --> 01:49:23,922
"I don't feel like anything"

755
01:49:24,793 --> 01:49:27,091
"What do I say, what do I do?"

756
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:33,933
"In front of me...
just keep sitting"

757
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:37,094
"Just let me look at you"

758
01:49:39,805 --> 01:49:44,104
"You called out to me,
and look, here I am"

759
01:49:44,476 --> 01:49:47,934
"What greater than
the promise to love?"

760
01:49:49,648 --> 01:49:53,105
"When I saw you, I realised..."

761
01:49:54,818 --> 01:49:58,116
"what madness love is"

762
01:49:59,656 --> 01:50:03,114
"I saw you, I realised..."

763
01:50:04,826 --> 01:50:08,124
"what madness love is"

764
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:13,128
"From here, where to?"

765
01:50:14,834 --> 01:50:18,133
"Just let me die in your arms".

766
01:51:08,879 --> 01:51:11,507
Take me away from here, Raj.
Take me away from here!

767
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:16,349
What...?
- You don't know...

768
01:51:16,486 --> 01:51:19,683
what's going on in there!
Day after tomorrow is the engagement.

769
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:24,688
The wedding is after a fortnight.
All arrangements are in place.

770
01:51:26,394 --> 01:51:30,693
Babuji gave his word to his friend.
And he lives by his word.

771
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:36,199
He can do anything, but he can't
go back on his word.

772
01:51:37,903 --> 01:51:45,035
We have to run from here. We must!
- No Simran. I'm not eloping.

773
01:51:45,176 --> 01:51:49,875
I haven't come here to steal you.
I might have been born in England.

774
01:51:50,748 --> 01:51:56,880
But I am Hindustani. I've come here
to take you as my bride.

775
01:51:58,588 --> 01:52:04,548
I'll take you only when
your Babuji gives me your hand.

776
01:52:04,925 --> 01:52:06,893
You don't know my Babuji!

777
01:52:08,596 --> 01:52:12,053
We have to get away from here, Raj.
Please Raj, take me away from here.

778
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:20,898
Do you love me?
- More than anyone else.

779
01:52:22,608 --> 01:52:25,736
Do you trust me?
- More than I trust myself.

780
01:52:28,446 --> 01:52:33,246
Then listen carefully to what
I'm going to say. From now on...

781
01:52:33,383 --> 01:52:38,752
we're strangers. I don't know you
and you don't know me. Go back.

782
01:52:38,888 --> 01:52:41,253
Let things happen as they're happening.
Leave the rest to me.

783
01:52:43,625 --> 01:52:49,256
What I'm upto is daunting. But I have
complete faith in our love.

784
01:52:50,631 --> 01:52:54,259
But alone... I cannot tread upon
this path.

785
01:52:55,468 --> 01:52:56,765
You will have to be my strength.

786
01:52:56,903 --> 01:53:02,602
You must co-operate. Tell me,
will you stand by me?

787
01:53:08,146 --> 01:53:13,276
Remember one more thing.
I'm here only for your sake.

788
01:53:14,984 --> 01:53:20,944
Till I have you for lifetime's
sakes, I am not leaving.

789
01:53:26,994 --> 01:53:31,953
Listen, what's the name
of the one you're marrying?

790
01:53:33,166 --> 01:53:34,633
Kuljit Singh.

791
01:54:03,792 --> 01:54:06,089
Help!
Anybody here?

792
01:54:07,128 --> 01:54:08,425
Somebody, help me!

793
01:54:08,963 --> 01:54:13,422
Where's everyone? Help!

794
01:54:34,817 --> 01:54:36,284
Anybody around?

795
01:54:45,293 --> 01:54:49,626
Had Raj not arrived in the nick
of time, I would've been the prey.

796
01:54:50,664 --> 01:54:53,132
Raj, I'm sold out!

797
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:56,127
- What are you saying?
- Where are you from?

798
01:54:57,503 --> 01:55:00,631
I've never seen you before
- I'm from London.

799
01:55:01,174 --> 01:55:04,631
Our guest from London!

800
01:55:06,344 --> 01:55:12,144
What have you come here for?
- To achieve something.

801
01:55:13,183 --> 01:55:14,980
To achieve what? Do tell us.

802
01:55:16,185 --> 01:55:18,153
Land... land.
- Land...?

803
01:55:18,353 --> 01:55:22,812
Yes, if I could find a good stretch
of land, I want to set up a factory.

804
01:55:23,858 --> 01:55:28,158
Factory, making what?
- Beer.

805
01:55:32,365 --> 01:55:34,663
Tell me something, Kuljit.
Will 8-10 million pounds...

806
01:55:35,202 --> 01:55:37,169
be enough to set up a factory?

807
01:55:38,537 --> 01:55:41,335
What happened?
- 8-10 million pounds?

808
01:55:41,807 --> 01:55:47,334
Too less? I can get more.
- No! That's a lot. Enough.

809
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:55,010
God is great! He makes us meet.
We'll get along fine together.

810
01:55:56,052 --> 01:55:58,679
You want to set up a factory?
As good as done.

811
01:55:59,221 --> 01:56:01,189
Done, my man.

812
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:03,858
By the way Raj...

813
01:56:05,392 --> 01:56:11,194
where are you staying?
- You see, I don't know anyone around.

814
01:56:11,899 --> 01:56:13,525
So I'm putting up at
the Circuit House.

815
01:56:14,067 --> 01:56:17,036
Strange! Now you know me.

816
01:56:17,737 --> 01:56:22,537
I have a palatial house! And you'll
stay at the circuit house? No way!

817
01:56:22,741 --> 01:56:25,368
Binda, go and get his luggage from
the circuit house. Drop it home.

818
01:56:25,576 --> 01:56:28,373
What are you doing, Kuljit?
- Not a word.

819
01:56:28,578 --> 01:56:32,207
You've saved my life, saved Kuljit!
Can't I do as much for you?

820
01:56:33,249 --> 01:56:36,878
I know, you're from London.
Here in Punjab, we're lions.

821
01:56:37,586 --> 01:56:41,214
You're going to enjoy yourselves.
- Well, if you're forcing me...

822
01:56:41,356 --> 01:56:44,052
as you wish.
- That's like it!

823
01:56:44,259 --> 01:56:46,227
What about babes?

824
01:56:48,929 --> 01:56:50,897
We'll have a blast!

825
01:56:51,265 --> 01:56:53,233
You haven't gone yet?

826
01:56:53,433 --> 01:56:57,232
Go on Binda, hurry up.
Get a Black Label for Raj.

827
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:59,738
I'm going to have a scotch with Raj.

828
01:57:01,439 --> 01:57:06,068
Show me a cigarette, man. Strange!
The lighter too.

829
01:57:12,282 --> 01:57:16,240
You have done us a great favour
in saving Kuljit's life.

830
01:57:16,451 --> 01:57:21,582
No, it was my duty.
- May you live long, son.

831
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:25,258
Preeti, give Raj some sweets.

832
01:57:33,466 --> 01:57:34,933
Enough

833
01:57:35,869 --> 01:57:38,268
10 million pounds! Why didn't
you tell me before?

834
01:57:38,469 --> 01:57:41,927
I was about to...
- Raj! My son!

835
01:57:42,807 --> 01:57:44,273
The sweets.
- I have some.

836
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:48,103
Let me feed you. That's like it!
You want to set up a factory, no?

837
01:57:48,312 --> 01:57:50,780
We'll set it up for you.
- What was I telling you?

838
01:57:51,647 --> 01:57:54,115
Get dressed fast. We're going
to Baldev's for lunch.

839
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:57,115
Who's Baldev?
- He's my friend, man!

840
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:00,288
His daughter is marrying my Kuljit.

841
01:58:03,325 --> 01:58:07,624
What am I going to do over there?
- That's true. What will he do there?

842
01:58:07,828 --> 01:58:11,628
But if you insist, I'll come along.
- That's like it!

843
01:58:12,832 --> 01:58:17,632
Baldev is a bit British.
He'll mind it if we're late.

844
01:58:17,836 --> 01:58:19,803
Let's make it on time.
- That's like it!

845
01:58:20,338 --> 01:58:23,466
You get dressed fast. We're always
getting late because of you.

846
01:58:24,008 --> 01:58:27,306
Kuljit, I have something to tell you.
- Don't worry about the factory.

847
01:58:29,846 --> 01:58:31,313
I have...

848
01:58:33,016 --> 01:58:34,983
I'll take all of it.

849
01:58:40,755 --> 01:58:42,814
Compliments.

850
01:58:57,202 --> 01:58:59,170
My compliments.

851
01:59:13,883 --> 01:59:17,511
Listen...
- I...?

852
01:59:18,887 --> 01:59:20,855
How did the shopkeeper get here?

853
01:59:24,558 --> 01:59:29,689
I've seen you somewhere before.
- Not me. I never step out of the house.

854
01:59:29,896 --> 01:59:33,695
In London...?
- But I haven't been beyond Ludhiana.

855
01:59:34,733 --> 01:59:38,361
Have you met my friend Raj?
He has just arrived from London.

856
01:59:38,569 --> 01:59:41,037
What are you saying?
- Balli, the doctor...

857
01:59:41,406 --> 01:59:44,704
Raj is the one who saved
Kuljit's life yesterday.

858
01:59:46,243 --> 01:59:50,703
You know who this is? The oldest
of my friends. My kinsman to-be.

859
01:59:51,914 --> 01:59:53,882
What are you staring at?
Touch his feet.

860
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:55,717
My respects.

861
01:59:55,851 --> 01:59:58,375
Hurry! The doctor has been
asking for you for ages.

862
02:00:01,022 --> 02:00:03,889
This doctor is a wonderful fellow.
Come on, man.

863
02:00:04,592 --> 02:00:07,389
Old foggie has quite a memory.
- What happened?

864
02:00:07,928 --> 02:00:12,227
Nothing. This is great! Lovely house!
- I told you.

865
02:00:17,936 --> 02:00:20,733
This is Raj. My friend.
He has come from London.

866
02:00:21,772 --> 02:00:23,740
This is Simran.

867
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:27,736
Namaste, Simran-ji.

868
02:00:28,111 --> 02:00:33,071
Were it not for him yesterday,
you and I wouldn't be here together.

869
02:00:33,782 --> 02:00:35,409
What a thing to say...

870
02:00:46,461 --> 02:00:49,917
Very glad to meet you, Ms Rajeshwari.

871
02:00:50,796 --> 02:00:56,597
What is this?
- A little gift. For a little bride.

872
02:01:04,808 --> 02:01:10,439
Mr Raj, folks I like
can call me Chutki.

873
02:01:13,483 --> 02:01:17,942
And folks who like me,
call me Raj. Only Raj.

874
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:25,287
Namaste, Simran-ji.
- Namaste.

875
02:01:25,992 --> 02:01:27,619
Come on now.

876
02:01:34,833 --> 02:01:36,801
This is Raj, my British friend.

877
02:01:37,502 --> 02:01:39,970
The one I told you about.
- My respects.

878
02:01:40,171 --> 02:01:42,139
May you live long, son.
- Coming.

879
02:01:42,340 --> 02:01:44,466
Have some.
- Thanks Ma-ji (Mother).

880
02:01:46,510 --> 02:01:50,469
Let me do the rest for you.
- No, you belong to the groomspeople.

881
02:01:50,847 --> 02:01:54,145
You're our guest.
- How strange of you.

882
02:01:55,184 --> 02:01:58,641
A moment ago you called me your son.
The next moment, you disown me?

883
02:02:00,522 --> 02:02:01,819
Allow me.

884
02:02:08,394 --> 02:02:11,989
Just try this lassi. I made it with
my own hands! Here you are, Aunt.

885
02:02:12,198 --> 02:02:14,665
Here you are Parjai-ji (Aunt).
This is for you, Aunt.

886
02:02:14,866 --> 02:02:16,834
That's a lovely dress.

887
02:02:17,702 --> 02:02:19,669
Excuse me...

888
02:02:22,206 --> 02:02:23,833
After you.

889
02:02:32,048 --> 02:02:35,016
Why are you taking all this trouble?
We kids can manage. Allow me.

890
02:02:35,217 --> 02:02:37,845
That's what I've been saying all
along. But no one will listen to me.

891
02:02:38,053 --> 02:02:40,020
I've been given all the work.
- That's my point.

892
02:02:40,221 --> 02:02:43,849
Hey... who are you?
- I...? I'm Raj.

893
02:02:43,990 --> 02:02:47,016
Raj, who...?
- Your son-in-law to-be.

894
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:50,858
Kuljit is your son-in-law to-be, no?
I'm his friend.

895
02:02:51,063 --> 02:02:54,862
Darling boy! Put the glasses there.
- Sure.

896
02:02:55,066 --> 02:02:56,533
Such a darling!

897
02:03:01,739 --> 02:03:05,538
Today I see the best sign!
For the first time...

898
02:03:05,676 --> 02:03:08,372
I'm seeing Simran laughing
with such mirth!

899
02:03:12,248 --> 02:03:14,216
Give that to me.
- I won't.

900
02:03:18,686 --> 02:03:21,883
True, Ma-ji. Simran looks
very cheerful.

901
02:03:41,606 --> 02:03:44,403
Sweet? Salted?

902
02:03:49,613 --> 02:03:54,242
Nothing's happening for Raj here!
Get ready to leave.

903
02:05:00,505 --> 02:05:05,464
Son of an Englishman! Get up!
Hurry! We're going hunting.

904
02:05:09,845 --> 02:05:12,472
Look at him
Aren't you coming? Get up.

905
02:05:12,847 --> 02:05:15,475
I'm sick. I have high fever.

906
02:05:15,684 --> 02:05:18,652
Caught such a chill last night,
I slept in my shoes, you know.

907
02:05:19,186 --> 02:05:22,485
You're wearing only one shoe.
- That's the leg that caught the chill.

908
02:05:23,023 --> 02:05:27,152
Sorry friend, I just can't
go hunting with you.

909
02:05:29,195 --> 02:05:32,823
You British are so feeble.
I'll send medicines for you.

910
02:05:33,031 --> 02:05:34,328
Make sure you're fine
by this evening.

911
02:05:34,466 --> 02:05:36,991
We're having fowl for dinner.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

912
02:05:37,202 --> 02:05:38,668
Hey Kuljit...

913
02:05:44,708 --> 02:05:46,676
Come on Raj, get started.

914
02:05:48,711 --> 02:05:52,009
What's this?
- Keep moving.

915
02:05:53,548 --> 02:05:57,348
What's all this Raj?
- Wonderful thing happened today.

916
02:05:57,885 --> 02:06:02,514
Met a minister on my way. Turns out
to be my Daddy's childhood friend.

917
02:06:02,723 --> 02:06:06,021
He gave me all this. Let me take care
of that. Don't tire yourself.

918
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:10,188
I'm a lone fellow you know. What use
this sugar, rice and wheat for me?

919
02:06:10,396 --> 02:06:12,693
So I thought I'd bring it over.
There's a wedding in the offing here.

920
02:06:12,831 --> 02:06:15,356
Could be useful, no?
- Maybe so, son.

921
02:06:15,734 --> 02:06:18,032
But we're the bridespeople.
Can't take anything from you.

922
02:06:18,236 --> 02:06:22,035
Not again. Once and for all,
decide what you take me for.

923
02:06:22,239 --> 02:06:25,538
Either you don't call me a son,
or you treat me like a son.

924
02:06:26,409 --> 02:06:28,876
How do you treat sons?
- You don't argue with sons.

925
02:06:29,411 --> 02:06:32,209
All right. I won't argue.
- That's like it.

926
02:06:33,248 --> 02:06:36,546
Now listen to the real thing, Ma-ji.
My mother used to say...

927
02:06:37,084 --> 02:06:41,042
one who helps out with a wedding,
gets a pretty bride.

928
02:06:42,922 --> 02:06:46,722
All this, for a pretty bride?
- What else? Only lucky ones...

929
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:50,056
find good brides nowadays.
- What kind of a bride d'you want?

930
02:06:54,933 --> 02:06:58,231
Say, someone like you.

931
02:06:59,771 --> 02:07:02,069
Don't say that.
Give me your blessings.

932
02:07:02,572 --> 02:07:04,539
Granted. You'll get a bride you want.

933
02:07:05,441 --> 02:07:08,239
All right, I'm off.
- Will you please open this?

934
02:07:13,782 --> 02:07:15,750
It's going to open.

935
02:07:16,216 --> 02:07:19,583
Aunt, don't keep looking,
don't even think. Just take it.

936
02:07:19,787 --> 02:07:22,255
Stuff like this is hard to find
even in Delhi or Bombay.

937
02:07:22,456 --> 02:07:25,754
Just wear it and step out,
and you'll make the girls stare.

938
02:07:26,125 --> 02:07:29,754
Don't even ask me about the boys
- It's nice.

939
02:07:36,968 --> 02:07:38,093
Not special.

940
02:07:38,302 --> 02:07:43,261
You show me that one.
- Okay. Here you are.

941
02:07:43,473 --> 02:07:47,932
Superb stuff. Just take a look at
the borders. On you, resplendent.

942
02:07:50,646 --> 02:07:53,614
Such bad ones! If you have
something special, show me.

943
02:07:53,815 --> 02:07:56,283
I have to wear it for the wedding.
- Here you are.

944
02:07:56,984 --> 02:08:01,613
This is for weddings. If you aren't
pleased, I'm no connoisseur.

945
02:08:02,322 --> 02:08:06,451
Pure gold thread.
On you, looks exotic!

946
02:08:07,059 --> 02:08:09,789
Don't talk rot! It's not that good.

947
02:08:14,165 --> 02:08:19,124
Not that bad either.
I'll keep it.

948
02:08:25,341 --> 02:08:27,308
Pack it. And put a good price.

949
02:08:28,677 --> 02:08:30,804
You've worn me out.

950
02:09:03,038 --> 02:09:06,337
Raj, let's have a song from you.
- I can't sing.

951
02:09:06,542 --> 02:09:08,840
Coy like a girl? Sing.
- Oh no Grannie...

952
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:12,336
Sing... please.

953
02:09:14,048 --> 02:09:16,675
I'm in love, why am I afraid?

954
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:22,518
I've loved,
I haven't stolen anything.

955
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:25,355
Why should I weep secretly?

956
02:09:31,062 --> 02:09:33,189
I'll live for love,
I'll die for love.

957
02:09:33,732 --> 02:09:38,190
What else have I to do?
- I'm in love, why am I afraid?

958
02:09:42,372 --> 02:09:46,205
You've got your aim all wrong.

959
02:09:50,913 --> 02:09:54,871
Forget it, you can't even sing.

960
02:10:03,657 --> 02:10:08,389
The lover will carry his bride away.

961
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:18,891
The bridespeople will be left gaping.

962
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:24,238
The lover will carry his bride away.

963
02:10:34,281 --> 02:10:36,749
What are you doing?
Everyone's out there! Let go!

964
02:10:36,951 --> 02:10:38,248
On one condition.
- What?

965
02:10:38,385 --> 02:10:40,353
Give me a kiss Senorita.
- Are you crazy?

966
02:10:40,487 --> 02:10:43,421
One kiss
- Ma might see!

967
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,927
Let her see.

968
02:10:49,961 --> 02:10:52,589
Chutki might see!
- Let her see.

969
02:10:55,298 --> 02:10:58,267
Aunt might come by.
- Let her come.

970
02:11:10,144 --> 02:11:12,772
This Babuji is going to
get me killed!

971
02:11:16,817 --> 02:11:19,945
What are you wondering Baldev?
There's no countermove.

972
02:11:20,988 --> 02:11:23,956
First time in 20 years,
I have you checkmated.

973
02:11:26,158 --> 02:11:30,616
Good move, indeed.
This once l'm checkmated.

974
02:11:33,998 --> 02:11:38,627
That's check. And mate.
- Wonderful!

975
02:11:39,002 --> 02:11:41,300
Yes Babuji, I'm wonderful.

976
02:11:41,671 --> 02:11:43,639
How did he checkmate?

977
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:48,799
No, I'll put it back.
- No, let me take a look.

978
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:17,166
What happened?

979
02:12:19,369 --> 02:12:21,336
You know what's about
to happen tomorrow?

980
02:12:22,371 --> 02:12:23,998
What?

981
02:12:25,541 --> 02:12:27,667
Tomorrow, I'm going
to be engaged to Kuljit.

982
02:12:37,217 --> 02:12:41,346
Tomorrow, Kuljit will put
a ring on this finger.

983
02:12:44,222 --> 02:12:47,680
You know why the engagement ring
is worn on this finger?

984
02:12:51,562 --> 02:12:54,861
Because the artery from this finger
leads straight to the heart.

985
02:12:59,069 --> 02:13:01,196
I can't wear anyone else's ring
but yours, Raj.

986
02:13:02,105 --> 02:13:05,699
If you want me to walk up in front
of everyone with a ring...

987
02:13:05,841 --> 02:13:08,537
and put it on you, I'll do it.
No problem.

988
02:13:10,244 --> 02:13:13,372
All this is a great joke for you,
isn't it? What I'm going through...

989
02:13:13,514 --> 02:13:16,710
you can never imagine
- Look at me.

990
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:18,549
Look.

991
02:13:19,586 --> 02:13:24,886
I feel everything Simran, the way
you're pining, your pain, your tears.

992
02:13:26,424 --> 02:13:28,722
But why don't you understand?
This is just the beginning.

993
02:13:30,095 --> 02:13:32,221
These people haven't even gotten
to know me properly.

994
02:13:34,098 --> 02:13:38,898
I need more time, Simran.
And I need your support.

995
02:13:40,436 --> 02:13:47,238
I want you to smile. And listen,
no son of a gun can take you...

996
02:13:47,776 --> 02:13:50,574
away from me, using just a ring.

997
02:13:52,446 --> 02:13:55,574
You're mine, only mine.

998
02:14:04,123 --> 02:14:06,090
Chutki might wake up. Go away.

999
02:14:08,793 --> 02:14:10,420
Listen.

1000
02:14:33,982 --> 02:14:35,448
Didi...

1001
02:14:37,316 --> 02:14:39,944
Can I say something?
- Go on.

1002
02:14:40,820 --> 02:14:46,121
I don't like this Kuljit one bit.
Don't marry him.

1003
02:14:47,492 --> 02:14:49,459
It's very late. Go to sleep.

1004
02:14:51,162 --> 02:14:56,292
Didi, I like the one
who was on the roof.

1005
02:14:59,669 --> 02:15:01,637
What did you say?

1006
02:15:06,675 --> 02:15:10,974
Didi, isn't Raj the one
you met in Europe?

1007
02:15:15,515 --> 02:15:17,141
Yes.

1008
02:15:17,516 --> 02:15:22,977
I like him a lot! You marry him.
- Don't you worry.

1009
02:15:23,522 --> 02:15:25,318
He's the one I'm marrying.

1010
02:15:33,864 --> 02:15:36,662
Yes Grannie?
- Pistachios for the sherbet.

1011
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,164
Done.

1012
02:15:38,868 --> 02:15:42,497
Raj, where are the flowers?
- You put them beside the staircase.

1013
02:15:42,638 --> 02:15:46,004
Oh I forgot! Were it not for you,
everything would be topsy-turvy.

1014
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:50,339
That's what I'm saying.
The lover will take his bride away.

1015
02:15:50,545 --> 02:15:54,172
Raj, weren't you with the
groomspeople? Have you switched...

1016
02:15:54,314 --> 02:15:58,011
over to the bridespeople?
- Someday I'll have a bride too, no?

1017
02:15:58,218 --> 02:16:02,176
Just putting in some practice. Get it?
- Never mind. Get lost.

1018
02:16:02,387 --> 02:16:04,355
Son of a gun.

1019
02:16:22,571 --> 02:16:24,869
Kuljit is so lucky!
- Really.

1020
02:16:32,412 --> 02:16:34,380
Now give her yours.

1021
02:16:38,251 --> 02:16:40,219
Simran, offer your hand.

1022
02:16:41,686 --> 02:16:43,711
Simran, put your hand out.

1023
02:16:48,093 --> 02:16:49,719
Come on.

1024
02:16:54,532 --> 02:16:56,499
What's this?

1025
02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:01,058
Last night, while taking off
my bangles, I hurt my finger.

1026
02:17:04,940 --> 02:17:07,407
Never mind. The other hand

1027
02:17:18,684 --> 02:17:21,915
"These girls are poison pills"

1028
02:17:23,455 --> 02:17:26,753
"These boys are rogues"

1029
02:17:28,626 --> 02:17:32,584
"Poison pills.
- Rogues"

1030
02:17:45,239 --> 02:17:47,434
"Make sure you're painted
with henna"

1031
02:17:47,975 --> 02:17:49,943
"Make sure the bride's palanquin
is ready"

1032
02:17:55,248 --> 02:17:59,775
"To take you away, o'beauty,
your lover is coming"

1033
02:18:17,667 --> 02:18:21,625
"Make sure you come with your face
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra"

1034
02:18:27,075 --> 02:18:31,306
"It's a matter of hearts.
Keep it in your heart"

1035
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:14,340
"For a signal
from your flying tresses..."

1036
02:19:14,714 --> 02:19:18,843
"with bated breath,
the bachelors await your suit"

1037
02:19:20,052 --> 02:19:23,852
"The maidens will go into hiding
out of shame..."

1038
02:19:24,389 --> 02:19:28,689
"for these are all madmen from town
come to our village"

1039
02:19:29,394 --> 02:19:33,523
"Keep your eyes downcast;
keep yourself chaste"

1040
02:19:34,731 --> 02:19:38,529
"Keep your eyes downcast;
keep yourself chaste"

1041
02:19:39,067 --> 02:19:43,367
"To take you away, o'beauty,
your lover is coming"

1042
02:20:22,937 --> 02:20:27,397
"I'm a young boy;
you're a pretty girl"

1043
02:20:28,041 --> 02:20:32,068
"If our hearts are swayed,
what's my crime?"

1044
02:20:32,779 --> 02:20:37,078
"You should've held your heart.
This beauty is magic"

1045
02:20:37,783 --> 02:20:41,912
"If the magic is working,
what's my crime?"

1046
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:46,750
"Keep up for me,
leave the door ajar"

1047
02:20:47,459 --> 02:20:51,758
"Keep up for me,
leave the door ajar"

1048
02:20:52,463 --> 02:20:56,591
"To take you away, o'beauty,
your lover is coming"

1049
02:20:57,632 --> 02:21:01,432
"Say no more now,
do no more now"

1050
02:21:02,637 --> 02:21:06,436
"Say no more now,
do no more now"

1051
02:21:07,141 --> 02:21:11,270
"It's a matter of hearts.
Keep it in your heart"

1052
02:21:12,345 --> 02:21:16,281
"Make sure you're painted with henna;
make sure your palanquin is ready"

1053
02:21:17,149 --> 02:21:21,108
"Make sure you come with your face
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra"

1054
02:22:24,539 --> 02:22:26,507
"O'my precious one..."

1055
02:22:29,709 --> 02:22:33,167
"O'my precious one...
you know not..."

1056
02:22:33,713 --> 02:22:37,011
"you're still pretty,
and I'm still young"

1057
02:22:38,217 --> 02:22:41,186
"I could still die for you, my love"

1058
02:23:08,909 --> 02:23:12,867
"Make sure you're painted with henna;
make sure your palanquin is ready"

1059
02:23:13,913 --> 02:23:17,041
"Make sure you come with your face
hidden behind the bridegroom's sehra".

1060
02:24:23,638 --> 02:24:28,097
Babuji, yesterday you were wonderful!
What a dance! Bested all the others.

1061
02:24:41,319 --> 02:24:44,116
No Babuji, just a speck of dirt.
Now it's clean.

1062
02:24:50,826 --> 02:24:55,286
Too few doves, don't you think?
The whites ones...

1063
02:24:57,666 --> 02:25:00,635
Iook... one, two, three.

1064
02:25:03,671 --> 02:25:05,969
No, maybe same like yesterday.

1065
02:25:25,188 --> 02:25:30,649
I've decided. Today I'm talking
it over with Raj.

1066
02:25:31,027 --> 02:25:34,154
Is it something to be ashamed of?
- Raj is here.

1067
02:25:34,697 --> 02:25:36,324
Back? So early?

1068
02:25:36,799 --> 02:25:42,668
Raj! My precious son! Come here.
We were just talking of you.

1069
02:25:46,707 --> 02:25:50,837
I've something important to tell you.
- Sure, go on.

1070
02:25:51,378 --> 02:25:56,507
This ought to be discussed by elders.
But since you're so close to us...

1071
02:25:57,048 --> 02:25:59,175
I thought, why not talk to you?
- Tell me.

1072
02:25:59,384 --> 02:26:04,184
I wish this friendship
to become a relationship.

1073
02:26:04,388 --> 02:26:06,855
Why not, why not?
- For my daughter, Preeti...

1074
02:26:08,391 --> 02:26:11,189
I seek your hand.

1075
02:26:14,997 --> 02:26:19,024
Raj! Better think up something fast!
Else, they have you trussed!

1076
02:26:19,501 --> 02:26:23,698
Raj, have you any objections?
- What...? Oh no. How could I?

1077
02:26:25,906 --> 02:26:28,203
My son!
- But I can't take...

1078
02:26:28,341 --> 02:26:30,866
such a big decision all by myself.
So you will have to talk to Pops.

1079
02:26:31,077 --> 02:26:33,044
Pops...?
- Father.

1080
02:26:33,579 --> 02:26:37,708
See? What a good boy!
- I never do anything...

1081
02:26:37,849 --> 02:26:41,546
against my father's wishes.
- No problem. Give me his number.

1082
02:26:41,753 --> 02:26:43,720
I'll talk to him over telephone.

1083
02:26:45,922 --> 02:26:50,051
He's away in America on business.
- Great! Gone to America!

1084
02:26:50,926 --> 02:26:54,054
Let ask him to come over.
- No problem.

1085
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:04,059
My country, my soil, my Raj!
Here I come, son.

1086
02:27:07,107 --> 02:27:10,404
Step out of the country,
and you'll find everything...

1087
02:27:10,776 --> 02:27:14,075
but the matthri your wife serves up.
- Compliments, lady.

1088
02:27:14,212 --> 02:27:18,739
Neither the language, nor the culture.
For one who loves the Ganga...

1089
02:27:18,949 --> 02:27:24,750
what's a Thames? So I told Raj
to return only with his bride.

1090
02:27:25,121 --> 02:27:26,088
That's like it!
- Such conviction.

1091
02:27:26,289 --> 02:27:29,588
What do you do in London?
- Back in London...

1092
02:27:29,793 --> 02:27:32,920
London...?
- Forget London. All I know is...

1093
02:27:33,128 --> 02:27:35,096
Go East, go West,
Punjab is the best!

1094
02:27:36,298 --> 02:27:38,266
Son!

1095
02:27:42,470 --> 02:27:44,438
Don't you worry.
I've got it all tied up.

1096
02:27:51,143 --> 02:27:53,269
You don't even introduce me
to your Daddy.

1097
02:27:53,745 --> 02:27:56,771
What a wonder! Just this morning,
we were talking about him...

1098
02:27:56,915 --> 02:28:00,441
and I find him in the marketplace,
armed with a photo, asking about you.

1099
02:28:00,984 --> 02:28:06,115
Whatever anyone says, this marriage
was made in Heaven! Right, lady?

1100
02:28:06,323 --> 02:28:08,290
Right.
- Right...?

1101
02:28:08,491 --> 02:28:12,120
You're strange! You don't need
my permission for a good deed.

1102
02:28:12,495 --> 02:28:14,792
What do you mean no? Have I ever
refused you anything.

1103
02:28:15,163 --> 02:28:17,461
How about sweets?
Your son-in-law is waiting.

1104
02:28:17,666 --> 02:28:19,133
Right away!
- Go on!

1105
02:28:19,334 --> 02:28:21,631
The wedding must be done right away!
A good deed can't wait.

1106
02:28:21,836 --> 02:28:25,293
I was thinking of Kuljit and Raj
getting married at the same time.

1107
02:28:26,005 --> 02:28:27,973
What was that?

1108
02:28:30,008 --> 02:28:33,808
It's final!
- Raj, are you happy?

1109
02:28:35,847 --> 02:28:39,146
Give me a sweet! Quick!
My son is happy!

1110
02:28:42,352 --> 02:28:47,312
Now you're marrying Preeti.
Her brother is Kuljit...

1111
02:28:47,691 --> 02:28:53,993
the one who's about to marry Simran.
And you love Simran. Not Preeti.

1112
02:28:54,363 --> 02:28:57,661
What was Preeti doing in London?
- Not Preeti. In London, it was Simran.

1113
02:28:57,866 --> 02:29:03,167
Yes, Simran... who's this Simran?
- Pops! Just give up thinking! Please.

1114
02:29:03,303 --> 02:29:05,270
Can anything be done without
giving it a thought?

1115
02:29:05,705 --> 02:29:12,007
I'm here. Everything will be alright.
- By now, it's done already!

1116
02:29:12,544 --> 02:29:17,174
Wedding must be done right away!
Good deed can't wait! Why did you come?

1117
02:29:23,053 --> 02:29:27,352
It was a mistake! Won't happen again.
I'll tell them that I forgot...

1118
02:29:27,490 --> 02:29:29,685
about your mother's death
anniversary.

1119
02:29:29,893 --> 02:29:31,860
Matter laid to rest for a month.

1120
02:29:34,897 --> 02:29:37,525
May I come in?
- Sure, come right in.

1121
02:29:38,066 --> 02:29:42,694
You're going to live very long.
Raj and I were just talking of you.

1122
02:29:43,069 --> 02:29:44,195
Sit.

1123
02:29:44,905 --> 02:29:47,202
You sit too. Milk for me?
Thank you!

1124
02:29:48,073 --> 02:29:50,701
Tomorrow's Karwa Chauth.
- What's Karwa Chauth?

1125
02:29:52,077 --> 02:29:54,874
I'd like to keep fast for
Raj's well-being. May I...?

1126
02:29:55,079 --> 02:29:57,377
Sure, no problem!
- Karwa Chauth, Pops...?

1127
02:29:57,916 --> 02:30:00,884
Karwa Chauth...? No! Never!

1128
02:30:01,251 --> 02:30:04,220
Why...?
- We consider it a bad omen...

1129
02:30:04,354 --> 02:30:07,050
for a girl to observe the ritual
for her husband before her marriage.

1130
02:30:07,423 --> 02:30:12,053
Besides my child, we can't discuss
the liaison for a month.

1131
02:30:12,595 --> 02:30:17,554
It was during this month
that Raj's mother passed away.

1132
02:30:19,099 --> 02:30:22,727
We have to fix another date for the
wedding. Let's talk to your father.

1133
02:30:22,936 --> 02:30:24,904
Ajit...

1134
02:30:35,947 --> 02:30:39,075
Raj, you know what day
it is tomorrow?

1135
02:30:41,786 --> 02:30:45,915
What's it now?
- My first Karwa Chauth.

1136
02:30:47,123 --> 02:30:50,421
I want you to give me water and
food after my fast.

1137
02:30:53,462 --> 02:30:55,259
Hands off.
- What?

1138
02:30:55,631 --> 02:30:57,597
I told you. Hands off.

1139
02:30:59,967 --> 02:31:04,596
Simran, if you don't love me, just
tell me straight. I'll go away.

1140
02:31:04,971 --> 02:31:08,930
Then you can marry Kuljit. It's going
to save me this everyday melodrama.

1141
02:31:09,475 --> 02:31:12,932
Is it something I said?
- But you never say anything, no?

1142
02:31:14,312 --> 02:31:17,440
I want you to give me water and
feed me the first morsel...

1143
02:31:17,582 --> 02:31:19,776
of food after my fast.

1144
02:31:20,150 --> 02:31:22,448
Are you out of your mind? You expect
me to make a grand entry saying...

1145
02:31:22,653 --> 02:31:26,611
"Hi Simran! I'm your husband-to-be!
Here, take a drink of water".

1146
02:31:27,657 --> 02:31:29,625
I don't care!
I'll even die of hunger!

1147
02:31:29,759 --> 02:31:31,624
But the first drink of water,
and the first morsel of food...

1148
02:31:31,761 --> 02:31:33,727
you will feed me! Get it?

1149
02:31:37,999 --> 02:31:39,465
Just like her father.

1150
02:31:40,333 --> 02:31:43,791
So why should I be
the butt of the joke?

1151
02:31:47,339 --> 02:31:51,969
You're unique, Mr Malhotra.
Your dress doesn't indicate...

1152
02:31:52,111 --> 02:31:55,978
your affinity to Hindustan.
- The dress has fooled even you?

1153
02:31:57,181 --> 02:32:01,981
I keep Hindustan in my heart.
- Wonderful!

1154
02:32:02,185 --> 02:32:04,312
Wonderful...?

1155
02:32:07,024 --> 02:32:10,481
Ajit was saying you're here
to set up a factory?

1156
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:14,325
The factory is just an excuse.
If you ask me the truth...

1157
02:32:14,528 --> 02:32:16,496
I'm here to choose a bride for Raj.

1158
02:32:18,365 --> 02:32:21,333
Then men are all out
in the outhouse.

1159
02:32:22,201 --> 02:32:25,329
They say, they don't want
to disturb us on Ladies' Day.

1160
02:32:26,372 --> 02:32:30,000
Are you keeping a fast too?
- Yes.

1161
02:32:33,545 --> 02:32:38,004
May you live long, my child.
My Kuljit is lucky to get...

1162
02:32:38,149 --> 02:32:40,515
a bride like you. Come.

1163
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:47,519
Ma-ji, this is my Pops. Father.

1164
02:32:49,724 --> 02:32:51,851
Your son has cast a spell
over everyone here.

1165
02:32:52,060 --> 02:32:54,028
That's my son.

1166
02:32:55,897 --> 02:32:57,864
I'll join you.

1167
02:33:01,401 --> 02:33:03,369
Pops, this is...
- I know.

1168
02:33:04,737 --> 02:33:06,204
She can only be Simran.

1169
02:33:21,251 --> 02:33:22,218
May you live long.

1170
02:33:35,262 --> 02:33:38,060
No one even watches his step.
Hold this. The flowers...!

1171
02:33:44,938 --> 02:33:48,065
"Let it rain flowers!"

1172
02:33:48,941 --> 02:33:52,741
"My beloved is here".

1173
02:34:09,290 --> 02:34:12,088
Kammo, where are the flowers?
Hurry up.

1174
02:34:17,297 --> 02:34:21,097
I'm Raj's father. From London.
- From London...?

1175
02:34:21,467 --> 02:34:24,766
Actually from Bhatinda. But I've
been in London for many years. You?

1176
02:34:25,471 --> 02:34:28,598
I'm Simran's Aunt.
- You can't be!

1177
02:34:29,141 --> 02:34:31,109
What...?
- You could be her sister.

1178
02:34:32,477 --> 02:34:39,109
Listen... aren't you keeping fast?
- No. I'm still a maiden.

1179
02:34:39,316 --> 02:34:41,783
Nothing could've been better.
- What...?

1180
02:34:42,152 --> 02:34:48,784
One of your flowers.
- Maybe it's for you. Keep it.

1181
02:35:04,670 --> 02:35:06,968
When is the moon going to rise?
I'm starving.

1182
02:35:07,173 --> 02:35:09,300
I hope it kills you.
Did I ask you to fast?

1183
02:35:16,347 --> 02:35:18,314
Eat this on the sly.
No one's looking.

1184
02:35:19,682 --> 02:35:22,150
Don't.

1185
02:35:25,187 --> 02:35:27,155
The moon is up.
- Where?

1186
02:35:27,289 --> 02:35:28,256
There

1187
02:35:57,714 --> 02:36:05,347
"On this night of prayer
for the wedded woman..."

1188
02:36:08,223 --> 02:36:13,525
"I look at the moon,
I pray with folded hands"

1189
02:36:14,229 --> 02:36:18,187
"Then I break my fast"

1190
02:36:21,401 --> 02:36:26,201
"Give me the water, take your slave
for your queen"

1191
02:36:27,173 --> 02:36:31,040
"Tonight, give me what I desire"

1192
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:36,367
"Come home o'wanderer,
your beloved beckons".

1193
02:36:48,924 --> 02:36:51,050
What happened?
- Water.

1194
02:36:53,594 --> 02:36:55,562
Simi, my child
- Drink water.

1195
02:36:56,030 --> 02:37:00,227
What happened? What happened to her?
- She swooned.

1196
02:37:02,269 --> 02:37:04,236
Get up. Come, my child.

1197
02:37:07,273 --> 02:37:09,741
What happened?
- It's all right. She just swooned.

1198
02:37:12,776 --> 02:37:15,574
It's nothing. Come on, let's eat.

1199
02:37:17,948 --> 02:37:19,915
She's so fragile, no?

1200
02:37:22,618 --> 02:37:24,745
Why are you anxious?
Are you fasting too?

1201
02:37:25,453 --> 02:37:27,421
No...
- Then come along.

1202
02:37:28,957 --> 02:37:36,089
It isn't easy for him to get away.
Everyone's asking for Raj all the time.

1203
02:37:36,964 --> 02:37:40,262
He won't be able to come, Didi.
Please, eat something.

1204
02:37:40,466 --> 02:37:46,268
I won't! I'd rather die starving.
- Very well, kill yourself.

1205
02:37:56,146 --> 02:38:00,276
I'm sorry, I'm late. But what to do?
They weren't about to leave me.

1206
02:38:00,649 --> 02:38:03,777
It was tough getting away.
Here, eat.

1207
02:38:04,653 --> 02:38:06,621
Eat it.

1208
02:38:08,489 --> 02:38:12,949
I said I'm sorry. Now eat.
Else, you'll swoon for real.

1209
02:38:17,331 --> 02:38:21,631
Chutki, tell him there's no need
for him to worry for me.

1210
02:38:22,501 --> 02:38:28,802
I was about to faint of hunger.
And there he was, filling his stomach.

1211
02:38:29,673 --> 02:38:34,303
Anyway, it's my first Karwa Chauth.
Why should he get so worked up?

1212
02:38:35,346 --> 02:38:36,642
Whether I live or die,
is he bothered?

1213
02:38:37,013 --> 02:38:41,473
You don't know this. But Raj hasn't
eaten anything all day either.

1214
02:38:42,018 --> 02:38:46,818
He wanted to break fast with you.
And he told me not to tell you.

1215
02:38:47,522 --> 02:38:49,820
Sorry Raj, but I couldn't
keep shut any longer.

1216
02:39:00,367 --> 02:39:01,664
Come here.

1217
02:39:02,869 --> 02:39:05,336
Talking to me?
- Come here.

1218
02:39:23,386 --> 02:39:25,853
I got carried away.
- No matter, Senorita.

1219
02:39:26,554 --> 02:39:29,352
In big places,
such small things happen.

1220
02:39:35,896 --> 02:39:37,864
My turn Senorita. Feed me.

1221
02:40:00,250 --> 02:40:04,379
I told you, not to betray my trust.
Simran hasn't forgotten him yet?

1222
02:40:05,087 --> 02:40:07,214
If she remembers,
she'll regret it.

1223
02:40:10,758 --> 02:40:13,556
What happened to me won't
happen to my daughter.

1224
02:40:13,761 --> 02:40:18,220
No more sacrifices at every step
as daughter, as sister, as wife.

1225
02:40:18,598 --> 02:40:22,225
She'll live life as she wishes.
She'll have her share of happiness.

1226
02:40:28,606 --> 02:40:29,731
Come in.

1227
02:40:55,796 --> 02:40:57,592
Keep this.

1228
02:40:57,797 --> 02:41:02,096
Ma, this...?
- Not a word! I know everything.

1229
02:41:03,969 --> 02:41:09,270
I've seen everything. Raj is the one
you met in Europe. I know.

1230
02:41:10,141 --> 02:41:13,109
I also know, the two of you
love each other dearly.

1231
02:41:13,977 --> 02:41:18,936
I was wrong Simran! My daughter
won't sacrifice her happiness.

1232
02:41:20,149 --> 02:41:22,117
She isn't going to sacrifice
her love.

1233
02:41:25,653 --> 02:41:32,456
I know Raj, you'll make my daughter
very happy. You have my blessings.

1234
02:41:33,494 --> 02:41:36,122
Take my daughter away.
Leave.

1235
02:41:37,163 --> 02:41:42,293
No one here cares for your love.
Take her away from here.

1236
02:41:43,835 --> 02:41:46,303
I'll take care of everything.
- No Ma-ji.

1237
02:41:46,505 --> 02:41:50,463
I don't want to hear anything! No!
Please go away from here!

1238
02:41:56,346 --> 02:41:59,975
I beg of you, son!
-I will Ma-ji. I'll take her away.

1239
02:42:02,518 --> 02:42:06,318
Come... sit here.

1240
02:42:09,524 --> 02:42:10,821
Keep this.

1241
02:42:14,194 --> 02:42:17,993
Ma-ji, I was a little boy
when my mother passed away.

1242
02:42:19,865 --> 02:42:22,162
But whatever I am today,
is because of her.

1243
02:42:23,701 --> 02:42:28,331
To this day I haven't forgotten
something she said. She'd say...

1244
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:35,501
"Son, at every turn in life, you'll
find two roads. One right, one wrong"

1245
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:42,511
"The wrong route will be easy, it
will draw you. But the right path..."

1246
02:42:42,652 --> 02:42:45,518
"will be hard, with lots of hazards,
a lot many troubles"

1247
02:42:47,722 --> 02:42:53,681
"On the wrong road, initially, you
might find success, happiness"

1248
02:42:55,562 --> 02:43:01,193
"But in the end, you will lose.
Upon the right path, initially..."

1249
02:43:02,901 --> 02:43:07,860
"you may trip at every step, you may
face hazards, difficulties.".

1250
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:13,539
But... in the end,
you will always win".

1251
02:43:17,247 --> 02:43:24,379
Now you tell me, Ma-ji. Am I
on the right, or on the wrong?

1252
02:43:28,756 --> 02:43:34,886
Your way is absolutely right, son.
But you don't know my husband.

1253
02:43:37,430 --> 02:43:41,559
And Ma-ji, your husband
doesn't know me.

1254
02:43:43,768 --> 02:43:48,568
If I wanted to elope with Simran,
I could've done it already.

1255
02:43:50,774 --> 02:43:54,402
But I want to be given Simran.
I don't want to steal her.

1256
02:43:55,778 --> 02:43:59,737
I don't want to take her away
on the sly. I want to do it openly.

1257
02:44:01,783 --> 02:44:05,913
If I have come, I'll surely
carry my bride away.

1258
02:44:07,455 --> 02:44:14,257
But only when Babuji gives me
her hand, of his own volition.

1259
02:44:16,795 --> 02:44:19,593
Now Simran isn't your problem.
She's my headache.

1260
02:44:20,799 --> 02:44:23,096
As for you, you have given
your daughter away.

1261
02:44:24,802 --> 02:44:28,260
Just a matter of time now
before the bride is carried away.

1262
02:44:41,651 --> 02:44:45,107
Is this crying illness
in the genes?

1263
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:06,959
How strange Uncle-ji! Tell me.
- The girl... what's her name...?

1264
02:45:07,171 --> 02:45:10,971
Yes Simran. I don't approve
of the match.

1265
02:45:11,675 --> 02:45:15,304
Why Uncle-ji?
- Girl's fine. But no match for you.

1266
02:45:15,679 --> 02:45:22,810
You're a strong young Jatt d'Punjab!
And this girl is frail, subdued.

1267
02:45:23,017 --> 02:45:26,816
Is this any match? Match for you
is a girl like a sparkler!

1268
02:45:28,021 --> 02:45:31,149
Just come with me to London.
The girls I'll introduce you to...

1269
02:45:31,358 --> 02:45:33,325
will drive you crazy!

1270
02:45:34,860 --> 02:45:39,661
What's the problem, Uncle-ji?
After the wedding, Simran stays here.

1271
02:45:40,031 --> 02:45:43,660
And we're going to be in London,
meeting your sparklers!

1272
02:45:48,872 --> 02:45:52,672
Pull out all the stops!
- You son of a gun.

1273
02:45:59,716 --> 02:46:06,847
As a little boy, I'd ride out to
the fields on my father's shoulders.

1274
02:46:08,888 --> 02:46:13,848
Ever since, I struck up a friendship
with these doves. I find it...

1275
02:46:13,994 --> 02:46:16,018
so peaceful out here.

1276
02:46:16,895 --> 02:46:21,525
I love spending time with the doves.

1277
02:46:23,735 --> 02:46:30,367
Tell me Babuji, are the doves here
different from the doves in London?

1278
02:46:36,579 --> 02:46:41,538
Difference there is. The doves here
know me, they recognise me.

1279
02:46:42,083 --> 02:46:46,883
They belong to my land.
Even the doves out there are alien.

1280
02:46:48,255 --> 02:46:55,717
Could it be that you perceive it
differently? Maybe a dove out there...

1281
02:46:56,929 --> 02:47:02,730
took to wings from here, from your
land... one who knows you...

1282
02:47:03,935 --> 02:47:08,894
one who recognises you.
Maybe you don't recognise him?

1283
02:47:19,113 --> 02:47:21,081
What happened?

1284
02:47:24,786 --> 02:47:28,414
What are you doing?
- My Ma used to say...

1285
02:47:28,789 --> 02:47:32,247
the soil of our land is very
powerful. It's going to be fine.

1286
02:47:33,459 --> 02:47:35,586
But this is outrageous!
Who might've done this?

1287
02:47:41,132 --> 02:47:43,100
Babuji, look.

1288
02:47:51,475 --> 02:47:52,772
Let's go.
- Babuji...

1289
02:47:55,977 --> 02:47:58,104
Are you still angry about
my beer act?

1290
02:48:00,982 --> 02:48:03,950
I was childish.
Won't you forgive me?

1291
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:07,787
I forgot that long ago.

1292
02:48:09,489 --> 02:48:13,619
I was wrong about you.
You're right.

1293
02:48:15,828 --> 02:48:20,629
I didn't recognise.
Come, let's go.

1294
02:48:30,173 --> 02:48:34,802
Ma-ji, what is the matter?
You asked for me?

1295
02:48:36,178 --> 02:48:39,806
Son, whatever the doctor might say,

1296
02:48:41,015 --> 02:48:45,314
I know my time's up.

1297
02:48:45,519 --> 02:48:49,148
Speak of nice things, Ma-ji.
What a thing to say?

1298
02:48:49,857 --> 02:48:53,815
Not to be anxious. I'm of the age
when one leaves.

1299
02:48:57,029 --> 02:49:00,828
I've had a wonderful life.

1300
02:49:02,868 --> 02:49:05,836
Son, I have nothing to
complain about.

1301
02:49:07,371 --> 02:49:10,828
But now that I see Simran...

1302
02:49:12,207 --> 02:49:16,337
after years a desire
wells up in my heart.

1303
02:49:19,046 --> 02:49:22,174
I want to see Simran married.

1304
02:49:24,385 --> 02:49:31,017
Before she marries, I wish I don't...
- How can you talk of such things?

1305
02:49:32,893 --> 02:49:34,860
Listen son.

1306
02:49:35,895 --> 02:49:40,194
The bride's palanquin has just got
to cross over from one house to another.

1307
02:49:41,232 --> 02:49:46,533
Now that everyone is here, what
difference would it make if...

1308
02:49:46,670 --> 02:49:52,539
the wedding is pre-poned to tomorrow?
- Absolutely correct!

1309
02:49:52,909 --> 02:49:55,877
The wedding happens tomorrow.
Yes Baldev? Right tomorrow.

1310
02:49:56,578 --> 02:49:58,546
Yes Ma-ji. Tomorrow.

1311
02:50:09,088 --> 02:50:11,215
We will have to take Simran away
on the sly.

1312
02:50:13,426 --> 02:50:17,885
Nothing else is going to work.
Don't worry. I have it all worked out.

1313
02:50:18,597 --> 02:50:22,896
We're taking the morning train out.
I'll wait for you at the station.

1314
02:50:23,034 --> 02:50:25,558
Somehow or the other,
just get there with Simran.

1315
02:50:25,702 --> 02:50:27,670
Whatever happens next, we'll see.

1316
02:50:28,939 --> 02:50:30,906
Are you listening?

1317
02:50:32,107 --> 02:50:35,907
I know this isn't your way. You don't
want to take Simran away like this.

1318
02:50:36,611 --> 02:50:40,411
But son, it's too late now.
If you love her...

1319
02:50:40,548 --> 02:50:45,746
if you want to spend a lifetime with
her, you must elope. Understand?

1320
02:50:54,393 --> 02:50:58,351
Please Raj, take me away from here!
You don't know my Babuji!

1321
02:50:58,897 --> 02:51:04,528
We have to run from here. We must!
- I've come to take you as my bride.

1322
02:51:05,068 --> 02:51:09,869
I'll take you only when
your Babuji gives me your hand.

1323
02:51:10,907 --> 02:51:13,033
What is to happen tomorrow,
I don't know.

1324
02:51:17,579 --> 02:51:21,207
What I'm going to do tomorrow,
I don't know.

1325
02:51:25,586 --> 02:51:27,712
But you must trust me.

1326
02:51:32,092 --> 02:51:38,553
Whatever I do tomorrow,
is going to be for both of us.

1327
02:51:44,935 --> 02:51:46,402
Do you love me?

1328
02:51:48,938 --> 02:51:50,405
Do you trust me?

1329
02:51:53,776 --> 02:51:59,407
Then it's just a matter of time
before the bride is carried away, no?

1330
02:52:07,988 --> 02:52:10,751
"Oh heart's love"

1331
02:52:14,794 --> 02:52:17,920
"Oh my love"

1332
02:52:24,467 --> 02:52:27,436
"I give you..."

1333
02:52:31,473 --> 02:52:35,273
"to God to keep"

1334
02:52:55,327 --> 02:52:57,625
"So strange are the ways
of the world"

1335
02:52:57,829 --> 02:53:00,456
"The heart is crazed,
yet so helpless"

1336
02:53:00,998 --> 02:53:03,466
"What's left to be heard?
What's left to be said?"

1337
02:53:03,667 --> 02:53:05,964
"Just let it lie between us"

1338
02:53:10,840 --> 02:53:15,970
"The hide-n-seek is over.
I'm getting married"

1339
02:53:21,849 --> 02:53:25,808
"How I wish it doesn't kill you".

1340
02:53:27,854 --> 02:53:31,312
Simi, come down, quick! Time for
the ritual body-painting with henna

1341
02:53:45,702 --> 02:53:47,828
"Oh my love"

1342
02:53:50,873 --> 02:53:53,842
"Oh my Moon"

1343
02:53:55,377 --> 02:53:59,006
"You are my life..."

1344
02:54:00,215 --> 02:54:03,513
"my beloved".

1345
02:55:03,667 --> 02:55:07,568
I wanted to tell you.

1346
02:55:10,606 --> 02:55:16,066
You were right.
I failed to recognise.

1347
02:55:18,613 --> 02:55:23,072
You enter my house,
and before my family...

1348
02:55:24,452 --> 02:55:27,078
you play with my honour?

1349
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:32,579
You have deceived me! You have
taken advantage of our trust!

1350
02:55:33,791 --> 02:55:36,089
You made a joke out of
our cordiality?

1351
02:55:38,129 --> 02:55:40,596
How dare you have an affair
with Simran?

1352
02:55:41,298 --> 02:55:45,257
Did you imagine you'd marry Simran?
You aren't even worthy of yourself.

1353
02:55:45,402 --> 02:55:47,370
How can you be worthy of Simran?

1354
02:55:48,637 --> 02:55:53,597
I was right about you.
Liars, wastrels like you never improve.

1355
02:55:54,310 --> 02:55:56,277
They only become worse.

1356
02:55:57,078 --> 02:56:00,445
No Babuji! No!

1357
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:14,281
Didn't I tell you to take me away?
No one cares for our love!

1358
02:56:14,993 --> 02:56:19,122
Didn't I say, let's elope?
- No Simran, don't.

1359
02:56:20,998 --> 02:56:22,965
You can only run from strangers.

1360
02:56:24,834 --> 02:56:27,132
From the ones we call our own
Our elders are our parents.

1361
02:56:42,516 --> 02:56:48,476
All our lives, they've brought us up.
They gave us so much love.

1362
02:56:51,023 --> 02:56:53,650
About our lives, they can
decide better than we can.

1363
02:56:56,694 --> 02:57:01,995
We have no right to make them sad
for the sake of our happiness.

1364
02:57:08,704 --> 02:57:15,836
Babuji is right.
I am a liar, a cheat.

1365
02:57:19,712 --> 02:57:26,674
Even if I lied for your sake,
a lie is always a lie.

1366
02:57:31,056 --> 02:57:36,357
Babuji is right.
I'm not worthy of you.

1367
02:57:39,897 --> 02:57:43,525
And so what if I can see nothing
beyond you?

1368
02:57:46,069 --> 02:57:49,697
And so what if I can remember
no one but you?

1369
02:57:52,575 --> 02:57:56,032
Babuji is right. I'm a wastrel.

1370
02:57:58,912 --> 02:58:01,710
How did I think of marrying you?

1371
02:58:04,750 --> 02:58:08,049
So what if this wastrel
loves you like a madman?

1372
02:58:18,262 --> 02:58:20,059
Love isn't everything, is it?

1373
02:58:24,100 --> 02:58:26,068
Babuji is right, Simran.

1374
02:58:28,104 --> 02:58:29,230
Babuji is right.

1375
02:58:36,944 --> 02:58:41,243
Here you are Babuji.
Take your daughter.

1376
02:58:55,627 --> 02:58:58,095
I didn't come here
to break anyone's heart.

1377
02:59:00,797 --> 02:59:02,765
I just wanted to win hearts.

1378
02:59:06,469 --> 02:59:08,437
Maybe I fall short of expectations.

1379
02:59:09,138 --> 02:59:11,106
Maybe that's why
I couldn't win you over.

1380
02:59:14,975 --> 02:59:18,433
If you think Kuljit will make
Simran happier...

1381
02:59:23,816 --> 02:59:25,784
then you're right.

1382
02:59:27,819 --> 02:59:32,279
What's best for Simran,
you know best.

1383
02:59:37,161 --> 02:59:39,789
Forgive me.

1384
03:00:38,878 --> 03:00:40,846
Forgive me Preeti.

1385
03:00:42,382 --> 03:00:44,508
I know I have hurt you.

1386
03:01:39,930 --> 03:01:42,227
Where's Simran, Raj?
Raj, where is Simran?

1387
03:01:44,099 --> 03:01:47,398
She will come, Pops.
She'll come.

1388
03:01:49,937 --> 03:01:51,564
Babuji will bring her. Personally.

1389
03:01:52,774 --> 03:01:54,742
He will have to.

1390
03:02:19,797 --> 03:02:23,424
I wish to hear no more.
Go away from here.

1391
03:02:24,299 --> 03:02:28,258
Your son has deceived all of us.
He has shown us where he belongs.

1392
03:02:29,137 --> 03:02:31,764
I won't let my daughter marry a liar!
- Enough!

1393
03:02:35,643 --> 03:02:39,601
I am proud of my son.
Don't incite me to passion.

1394
03:03:57,377 --> 03:03:59,345
Kuljit and Raj are fighting
at the station.

1395
03:03:59,479 --> 03:04:02,845
We must go there!
One might kill the other!

1396
03:04:03,382 --> 03:04:05,350
Come on.

1397
03:04:13,824 --> 03:04:15,849
Come with me Simran.

1398
03:05:09,103 --> 03:05:10,400
Stop.

1399
03:06:47,852 --> 03:06:50,821
Let me go, Babuji!
Please let me go.

1400
03:06:54,724 --> 03:06:57,989
Raj means all my life!
Without him, I can't live.

1401
03:06:59,028 --> 03:07:00,825
Let me go to my Raj.

1402
03:07:01,864 --> 03:07:04,492
Please let me go to my Raj.

1403
03:07:26,384 --> 03:07:27,350
Go Simran.

1404
03:07:29,887 --> 03:07:34,846
No one can love you more than him.

1405
03:07:36,225 --> 03:07:39,854
Go my child. Go to your Raj.

1406
03:07:41,229 --> 03:07:44,198
Go on Simran.
Live your life.

1407
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:47,368
Go my child, go

1408
03:08:48,285 --> 03:08:51,413
ln big places,
such small things happen.

1409
03:08:55,291 --> 03:08:57,921
The lover will carry his bride away.
