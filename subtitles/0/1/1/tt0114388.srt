1
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,240
Your son is arrived from London.

2
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,920
- Father ...
- John ...

3
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,520
You will see in my will the estate
of Norland was left to me in a way -

4
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,680
- that prevents me from dividing it
between my two families.

5
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Norland, in its entirety,
is therefore yours by law.

6
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,600
And I am happy for you and Fanny.

7
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,720
But your stepmother, my wife and
daughters are left only 500 a year.

8
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,560
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

9
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,320
- You must help them.
- Of course.

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,840
You must promise to do this.

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,280
I promise, Father.
I promise.

12
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,840
Help them? What do you mean?

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,280
I mean to give them 3,000. The
interest will be an extra income.

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,000
- The gift will fulfil my promise.
- Without question. More than amply.

15
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,000
One had rather. on such occasions.
do too much than too little.

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
Of course, he did not stipulate
a particular sum.

17
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,480
What do you say to 1,500, then?

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,960
What brother would be so kind to his
real sisters. Let alone half-blood?

19
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,000
- They can hardly expect more.
- What can you afford?

20
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,640
100 a year to their mother is
better than losing 1,500 at once.

21
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,640
Should she live longer than 15 years
we'd be completely taken in.

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,280
People live forever
when an annuity is to be paid them.

23
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,480
20 now and then will amply
discharge my promise, you're right.

24
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm convinced that your father
had no idea of giving them money.

25
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,680
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?

26
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,440
No housekeeping, carriage, horses,
few servants, keeping no company ...

27
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,840
How comfortable!

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,720
They will be much more able
to give you something.

29
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,560
Marianne.
can you play something else?

30
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,080
Mamma has been weeping
since breakfast.

31
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,000
I meant something less mournful.

32
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,120
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne. Elinor.

33
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,600
- Mamma, we have nowhere to go.
- John and Fanny will be here soon.

34
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,160
Do you expect me to be here
to welcome them? Vultures!

35
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,560
I will start making inquiries
for a new house at once.

36
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,000
Until then, we must try
to bear their coming.

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,640
Margaret, are you there? Come down,
John and Fanny will be here soon.

38
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,040
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.

39
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,480
Houses go from father to son, not
father to daughter. It is the law.

40
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,480
- Come, we'll play with your atlas.
- It's not mine. it's their atlas.

41
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,520
Do sit down.

42
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,120
We are looking for a new home, and
can only retain Thomas and Betsy.

43
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,840
We're sorry
to have to leave you all.

44
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But we are certain you will find the
new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.

45
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,480
My only real concern is how long
it will take them to move out.

46
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,280
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.

47
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,160
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.

48
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,600
He has his own barouche.

49
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,200
- You have two brothers?
- Yes. Edward is the elder.

50
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,520
He's travelling up from Plymouth
and will break his journey here.

51
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,160
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John ...

52
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,440
This is your home now.

53
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,120
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?

54
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,920
One can presume she wants
to count it. What are you doing?

55
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,680
Gifts for the servants. Where is
Margaret? She's taken to hiding.

56
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,280
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.

57
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,800
I have.
I've said yes and no.

58
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,840
Good morning, Fanny.

59
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,920
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

60
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,600
How did you find the silver?
Was it all genuine?

61
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,280
- When may we expect your brother?
- Edward is due tomorrow.

62
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,560
He will not stay long. Will Margaret
give up her room for him?

63
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,840
The view is incomparable, and I
want him to see Norland at its best.

64
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,280
Mrs. Dashwood.
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.

65
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,680
My brother, Edward Ferrars.

66
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,760
Do sit down.

67
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,080
Where is Miss Margaret? I'm
beginning to doubt of her existence.

68
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,880
Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest
is shy of strangers at present.

69
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,360
I am shy of strangers myself,
and I have nothing like her excuse.

70
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,640
How do you like your view,
Mr. Ferrars?

71
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,440
Very much. Your stables are handsome
and beautifully kept.

72
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,840
Stables?
Your windows overlook the lake.

73
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,040
An error led me to a family room,
but I've rectified the situation.

74
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,720
I am happily installed
in the guest quarters.

75
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,560
Tea!

76
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,400
They're all spoilt. Miss Margaret is
always up trees and under furniture.

77
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,040
I've barely had a civil word
from Marianne.

78
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,520
They've just lost their father.
Their lives will never be the same.

79
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,840
That is no excuse.

80
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,200
Library.

81
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,680
- These are mostly foreign.
- Indeed. Magnificent.

82
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,480
I've never liked the smell of books.

83
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,200
The dust, perhaps. I hear you have
great plans for the walnut grove.

84
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,120
I shall have it knocked down
to make place for a Grecian temple.

85
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,680
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?

86
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,080
Too expensive, and we do not need
four bedrooms. We can share.

87
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,400
This one. then.

88
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,080
We have only 500 a year.

89
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,320
I'll send out more inquiries today.

90
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,680
Pardon my intrusion, but I think I
have found what you're looking for.

91
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,720
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.

92
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:31,800
We'll have to enlarge it. Mattocks
will help you adjust toyour hours.

93
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:41,720
Forgive me, do you by any chance
have a reliable atlas?

94
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,800
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.

95
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,200
My sister tells me
it is in South America.

96
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,840
No!
No, she's quite wrong.

97
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I believe it is in Belgium.

98
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,080
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.

99
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,320
- The Volga, which starts in ...
- In Vladivostok. and ends in ...

100
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,360
- Wimbledon.
- Yes. where coffee beans come from.

101
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,000
The source of the Nile
is in Abyssinia.

102
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,680
Is it? Interesting.

103
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,480
- How do you do? Edward Ferrars.
- Margaret Dashwood.

104
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,720
It adjoins this property,
and would be a desirable addition.

105
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,080
- I'll ride there and speak to ...
- Gibson.

106
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,160
- He'll be pleased enough to sell.
- He'll want more than it is worth.

107
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,480
Have I hurt you?

108
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,360
Thank you.
Forgive me.

109
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,200
That was my father's favourite.

110
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,600
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.

111
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,640
I enjoy her company.

112
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,840
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.

113
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,960
Would you do me the honour,
Miss Dashwood?

114
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,480
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.

115
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,200
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know. She's off to China soon.

116
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,120
I'm to go as her servant, on the
understanding I'll be badly treated.

117
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,560
- What will your duties be?
- Sword fighting and swabbing.

118
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,360
Which will take precedence?

119
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,000
All I have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life.

120
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,960
But my mother is determined
to see me distinguished.

121
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,040
Orator. Politician. Even a barrister
would do. if I drove a barouche.

122
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,040
What do you wish for?

123
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,800
I prefer the church, but that is not
smart enough for my mother.

124
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,400
She prefers the army,
but that is too smart for me.

125
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,320
- Would you stay in London?
- I hate London.

126
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,640
Country living is my ideal. A small
parish where I might do some good.

127
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Keep chickens ...
Give very short sermons.

128
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,240
You feel idle and useless.
Imagine how that is compounded -

129
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,960
- when one has no choice
of any occupation whatsoever.

130
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,160
Our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same.

131
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,920
Except that you will inherit
your fortune.

132
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,640
We cannot even earnyours.

133
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,400
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Piracy isyour only option.

134
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,480
What is swabbing exactly?

135
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,360
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

136
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,800
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

137
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,120
"But l, beneath a rougher sea, and
whelmed in deeper gulfs than he ..."

138
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
No. Edward.

139
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,800
'"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

140
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,360
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

141
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,280
Can you not feel his despair?
Try again.

142
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,400
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone."

143
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,840
'When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

144
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,920
Mamma ...

145
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,840
Look.
This has just arrived.

146
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,200
"l should be pleased to offer you a
home at Barton Cottage, as soon ..."

147
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,560
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.

148
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,920
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No. I will fetch her.

149
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,080
Wait, let us delay.

150
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,040
I believe that Edward and Elinor
have formed an attachment.

151
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,120
It would be cruel to take her away
so soon. Devonshire is so far.

152
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,640
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.

153
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,440
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable? But ..?

154
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,920
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate. His reading ...

155
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,320
Elinor has not your feelings.

156
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,560
Can he love her? Can the soul
be satisfied with polite affections?

157
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,360
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet. Guinevere. Heloise.

158
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,040
- They made rather pathetic ends.
- Pathetic? To die for love?

159
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,000
- What could be more glorious?
- Your romantic sensibilities ...

160
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:06,440
"Is love a fancy or a feeling? No,
it is immortal as immaculate truth."

161
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,560
"It is not a blossom shed
when  outh drops from life's stem."

162
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,960
"It grows without water, nor ray of
promise cheats the pensive gloom."

163
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,880
A pity
Edward has no passion for reading.

164
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,040
You asked him to read.
then you made him nervous.

165
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,880
Your behaviour is cordial. You
like him in spite of his reading.

166
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,920
I think him everything
that is amiable and worthy.

167
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,880
Praise. indeed.

168
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,000
He shall have my devotion when
you tell me he is to be my brother.

169
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,440
- What shall I do without you?
- Without me?

170
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,440
I'm sure you will be very happy,
but promise you won't live far away.

171
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,360
- There is no question of ...
- Do you love him?

172
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,400
I do not deny that I think
very highly of him. That I ...

173
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,880
... greatly esteem him.
I like him.

174
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:29,080
Esteem? Like? Use these words again
and I shall leave the room!

175
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,040
Believe my feelings to be stronger.
Further than that. do not believe.

176
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,680
Is love a fancy or a feeling?

177
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,680
- Or a Ferrars?
- Go to bed.

178
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,960
"l do not deny
that I think very highly of him."

179
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,720
"That I ... greatly esteem him."

180
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,160
"That I like him."

181
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,160
We are so happy
that you invited Edward to Norland.

182
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,520
We're all very fond of him.

183
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:31,000
We have great hopes for him.
Mother expects much of him.

184
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,000
And in marriage. She's determined
both he and Robert will marry well.

185
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,120
But I hope she desires them
to marry for love.

186
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:48,000
The heart doesn't always lead us
in the most suitable direction.

187
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:56,240
Edward is a compassionate person.
Penniless women prey on that type.

188
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Having entered into an understanding
he would never go back on his word.

189
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,760
But it would lead to his ruin.

190
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,440
I'm worried. Mother will withdraw
all financial support from him -

191
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,600
- should he plant affection in less
exalted ground than he deserves.

192
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,720
I understand you perfectly.

193
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Devonshire?

194
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,480
My cousin, Sir John Middleton,
has offered us a small house.

195
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,200
He must be a man of property.

196
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,440
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he has offered.

197
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,360
A cottage? Charming.
A cottage is always very snug.

198
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,440
You will not leave
before the summer?

199
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,240
We can no longer trespass
upon your sister's goodwill.

200
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,600
- You will come and stay with us.
- I should like that.

201
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,880
Edward has long been expected
byyour mother.

202
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,400
Come as soon as you can, Edward.
Remember, you're always welcome.

203
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,960
- Can't you take him with you?
- We can't afford him.

204
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,760
Perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen ... Forgive me.

205
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,040
Miss Dashwood ...

206
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,760
Elinor ... I must speak to you.

207
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,000
There is something of
great importance that I need to ...

208
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,920
... tell you ...
about my education.

209
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,160
- Your education?
- Yes.

210
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,080
It was conducted.
oddly enough, in Plymouth.

211
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,120
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth? No.

212
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,520
I was four years there.

213
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,120
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.

214
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,520
- Pratt?
- Precisely. Pratt.

215
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,880
While I was there ...

216
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,360
That is to say, he had a ...
has a ...

217
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,440
You're needed in London
this instant.

218
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,520
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.

219
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,840
Excuse me.

220
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,560
Edward promised
he would bring the atlas to Barton.

221
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,760
I'll wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight.

222
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,080
Dear Edward ...

223
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,440
Hello there!

224
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,720
Sir John ...

225
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,560
Dear ladies!
Upon my word! Here you are!

226
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,440
- Sir John, your kindness ...
- None of that! Hush, please!

227
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,280
Here is my dear mamma-in-law,
Mrs. Jennings.

228
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,280
You must be Mrs. Dashwood. Was
Your journey tolerable? Poor souls!

229
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,680
Why did you not
come up to the park first?

230
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,600
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.

231
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,280
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.

232
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,040
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!

233
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,960
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John. we cannot ...

234
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:32,680
No refusals! I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!

235
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,520
Let us settle in.
But thank you very much.

236
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,680
Send your man up for the carriage
as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.

237
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,680
Don't thank us.

238
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Your feet are cold.

239
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,640
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.

240
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,400
It's cold. I'm cold.

241
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,760
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.

242
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,400
Col. Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

243
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,560
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.

244
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,360
But I dare say she's left her heart
behind in Sussex.

245
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,520
I see you, Miss Marianne! I think
I've unearthed a secret.

246
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,600
You are worse than my best pointer.

247
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,800
Is he a butcher. baker. candlestick
maker? I'll winkle it out of you.

248
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,200
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.

249
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,680
Or if we do.
we do not keep them long.

250
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,360
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

251
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,440
- Give us a clue. Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.

252
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,720
He's a gentleman?

253
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:21,120
- You know there is no such person.
- There is. His name begins with F.

254
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,880
F? A promising letter.

255
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,640
Foster?
Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?

256
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,400
- Fortescue?
- Fondant?

257
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,760
Might I play your pianoforte?

258
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,200
Yes. of course.

259
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,280
- We don't stand on ceremony here.
- Please forgive ...

260
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,240
I cannot remember when we last
had a song in the house.

261
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,320
Brandon! Come and meet
our beautiful new neighbours.

262
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,080
What a pity you're late.
You have not heardyour songbird.

263
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,480
A great pity.

264
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,360
This is my good friend Col. Brandon.
We served in the East Indies.

265
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:36,560
- Not a better fellow in the world.
- You've been to the East Indies?

266
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,000
- What's it like?
- Hot.

267
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,960
The air is full of spices.

268
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,280
Now. Miss Dashwood.
it's your turn to entertain us.

269
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,920
And I believe I know
what key you will sing in.

270
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,520
F-major ...

271
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,640
You have no right to parade
your ignorant assumptions ...

272
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,360
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.

273
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,920
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.

274
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,080
- Everyone else was.
- Mrs. Jennings is not "everyone".

275
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,160
I like her. She talks about things.
We never talk about things.

276
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:40,800
If you can say nothing appropriate,
limit your remarks to the weather.

277
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,200
Surely they have enough reeds
for a Moses basket.

278
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,920
You know what they're saying?

279
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:34,440
Word is, you've developed a taste
for certain company. And why not?

280
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,480
A man like you in his prime ...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.

281
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,000
Marianne Dashwood would
no more think of me than of you.

282
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:50,120
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.

283
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,320
Besotted ... An excellent match.

284
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,880
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?

285
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,000
As long as I've been here,
and I came 15 years back.

286
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,120
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.

287
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,160
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.

288
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,960
He loved a ward to the family.
They were not permitted to marry.

289
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,640
- On what grounds?
- Eliza was poor.

290
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,000
She was flung out of the house,
and he was packed off to the army.

291
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,240
I think he'd have done himself harm
if not for John.

292
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,280
- What became of the lady?
- She was passed from man to man.

293
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,880
She disappeared from good society.

294
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,920
When Brandon returned from India
he searched and searched. -

295
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,200
- only to find her dying
in a poorhouse.

296
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,240
I thought my daughter Charlotte
might have cheered him up.

297
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Look at him now!
So attentive!

298
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,040
- I should try a little experiment.
- Please. Let the colonel alone.

299
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,680
All suitors need a little help.

300
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,760
- We haven't heard you play of late.
- You have a superior musician here.

301
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:53,240
Brandon shares your passion for
music. He plays the pianoforte well.

302
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,560
You know as many melancholy tunes
as Miss Marianne.

303
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,960
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.

304
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,200
I do not know any duets.
Forgive me, Colonel.

305
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,720
Will we never have peace? The rent
is low. but it comes on hard terms.

306
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,560
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but
marry off everyone else's daughters.

307
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,120
There's a parcel arrived.

308
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Look!

309
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,840
When is a man safe from such wit.
if infirmity does not protect him?

310
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,040
If he is infirm.
then I am at death's door.

311
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,840
- He complained of rheumatism.
- "A slight ache" was his phrase.

312
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,480
Edward said
he would bring it himself.

313
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:08,360
"lt gives me great pleasure to
restore this atlas to its owner."

314
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,400
"Business prevents my delivering it,
which will hurt me more than you."

315
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,000
"Memories of your kindness must
sustain me. and I remain -

316
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,320
- your devoted servant,
E.C. Ferrars."

317
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:29,040
- Why hasn't he come?
- He says he's busy, dear.

318
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,960
- He said he'd come. Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.

319
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,880
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.

320
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,280
I fear
Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.

321
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,160
- You must miss him. Elinor.
- We are not engaged, Mamma.

322
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,960
- But he loves you, dearest.
- I am by no means assured of that.

323
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:09,160
And had he such a preference,
there would certainly be obstacles -

324
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,520
- to his marrying a woman of no rank
who cannot afford to buy sugar.

325
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,120
- But your heart must tell you ...
- It is better to use one's head.

326
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,280
- It can't be good for me.
- It is. Stop complaining.

327
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,160
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.

328
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,120
It's lovely. Come on, catch up!

329
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,200
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.

330
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,120
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.

331
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,400
- Blue sky! Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.

332
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,800
Are you hurt?

333
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:20,080
- I cannot walk. Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.

334
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,160
Margaret!

335
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,920
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

336
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,880
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.

337
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,920
May I have your permission to
ascertain if there are any breaks?

338
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,000
It is not broken.

339
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,520
Can you put your arm about my neck?

340
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,520
Allow me to escort you home.

341
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,160
At last!

342
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,440
She fell down and he's carrying her!

343
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Marianne, are you hurt?

344
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,280
It's a twisted ankle.

345
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,280
It's not serious.
I felt the bone. and it's sound.

346
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,200
- I cannot begin to thank you.
- Do not think of it.

347
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,920
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.

348
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:04,920
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.

349
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,120
I'll show you out.

350
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,480
Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.

351
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:19,080
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?

352
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,600
John Willoughby of Allenham
at your service.

353
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,440
John Willoughby of Allenham ...

354
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,680
What an impressive gentleman!

355
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,280
He lifted me as if I weighed no more
than a dried leaf.

356
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,320
- Tell me if I hurt you.
- She feels no pain, Mamma.

357
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,400
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up
a cold compress.

358
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,840
Please don't say anything important.

359
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,280
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.

360
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,720
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy. Ten words at most.

361
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,640
- Change, or you'll catch a cold.
- What care I for colds?

362
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,080
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right. Help me.

363
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,520
He's worth catching. Marianne must
not have all the men to herself.

364
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,120
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.

365
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,080
But what are his tastes.
his passions, his pursuits?

366
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:37,080
- He has a smart little pointer ...
- Where is Allenham?

367
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,680
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.

368
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,080
Lady Allen is the name.

369
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,920
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.

370
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,680
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.

371
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,360
Come in.

372
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,960
Good morning, Brandon.

373
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:16,600
- How is the invalid?
- Thank you so much, Colonel.

374
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:23,240
Why set your cap at Willoughby when
you've already made such a conquest?

375
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,400
I'll not set my cap at anyone.

376
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,360
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits. for he's to inherit.

377
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,640
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.

378
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,560
I'd not give him up to a younger
sister for tumbling down hills.

379
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:55,200
The man himself. Come. Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.

380
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,040
Thank you so much for calling.

381
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,240
Marianne. the colonel and Sir John
are leaving.

382
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,800
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.

383
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:23,200
- How do you do, Colonel?
- How do you do, more like.

384
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:45,600
- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!
- The pleasure is all mine.

385
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,800
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.

386
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,400
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature ...

387
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,240
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.

388
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:08,200
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.

389
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:14,960
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.

390
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,560
- Would you ..?
-your gratitude is beyond words.

391
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:27,360
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.

392
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,520
I felt an interest which nothing can
account for but my present delight.

393
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,920
Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.

394
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,080
Who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

395
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,040
- Marianne is reading them out.
- And which are your favourites?

396
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,280
Mine is 1 16.

397
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,440
"Let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments."

398
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,200
"Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds. -

399
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,320
- or bends with the remover
to remove ..."

400
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,080
- How does it continue?
- "No. it is an ever fixed mark ..."

401
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,200
- "That looks on tempests..."
- Is it "tempests"?

402
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:20,240
It's strange you are reading these.
I carry them with me always.

403
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,120
Until tomorrow then ...

404
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,560
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.

405
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,200
Goodbye. Thank you.

406
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,960
Good work. Marianne. You covered
Shakespeare, Scott, poetry.

407
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:00,240
When you know his views on romance,
you'll have nothing left to talk of.

408
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,000
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.

409
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,400
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt
of your enthusiasm for him.

410
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,440
Should I hide my regard?

411
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:19,480
- No. but we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.

412
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,440
Seven years is too little for some,
seven days is enough for others.

413
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,120
- Or seven hours. in this case.
- I feel I know him already.

414
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,360
Had I more shallow feelings, I could
perhaps conceal them as you do.

415
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,080
- I'm sorry ...
- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.

416
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,920
I do not understand her.

417
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,000
Marianne ...

418
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,640
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No. Patience.

419
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,520
You're not going to deny us
beef as well as sugar?

420
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,480
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?

421
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,520
No.
Just not to eat beef.

422
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,720
If my behaviour was improper,
I should be sensible of it.

423
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,440
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?

424
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:43,880
If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove
impropriety, we are all offending.

425
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,640
Good morning, Colonel.

426
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,320
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.
I come to issue an invitation.

427
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,400
A picnic on my estate
at Delaford.

428
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,040
If you would care to join us
on Thursday next.

429
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,360
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband
are travelling up especially.

430
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,600
We should be delighted, Colonel.

431
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,480
I will, of course, be including
Mr. Willoughby in the party.

432
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,640
I should be delighted to join you.

433
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,200
Good morning, Miss Dashwood.
Good morning, Colonel.

434
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,440
The colonel has invited us
to Delaford.

435
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:42,120
- I hear you have a fine pianoforte.
- A Broadwood Grand.

436
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,560
- Then I shall play for you all.
- We shall look forward to it.

437
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:07,280
- Your sister seems very happy.
- She does not hide her emotions.

438
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,840
Her romantic prejudices
tend to set propriety at naught.

439
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,360
- She is wholly unspoilt.
- Rather too unspoilt.

440
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,600
The sooner she is acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

441
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,040
I knew a lady with the same
sweetness of temper -

442
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,640
- who was forced into a
better acquaintance with the world.

443
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,360
The result was only
ruination and despair.

444
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,520
Do not desire it. Miss Dashwood.

445
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,400
Col. Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

446
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,160
Mind the pretty ribbons.

447
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:04,400
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte
and her master appeared with Lucy.

448
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,480
The last person I expected to see.

449
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:12,480
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.

450
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,200
I'd not seen you for so long.

451
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,280
You sly thing! It was the Dashwoods
she wanted to see.

452
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,920
I've heard nothing but "Dashwood"
for I don't know how long.

453
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:30,880
What do you think of them? My mother
wrote of little else in her letters.

454
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,040
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.

455
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,200
You are quite rude today.

456
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:44,320
He's to be an MP. and he is forced
to make everybody like him.

457
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:50,240
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.

458
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,000
Here he comes!
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

459
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,960
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

460
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,240
You must meet my daughter Charlotte,
and Mr. Palmer.

461
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:15,000
- Andyour cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.
- Welcome toyour party.

462
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,240
May I sit beside you?

463
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,440
I've longed to meet you. I've heard
nothing but praise for you.

464
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,840
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

465
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,480
The praise came from another source.
One not inclined to exaggeration.

466
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,800
What can this be?

467
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,320
Is Col. Brandon here?

468
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,720
- My horse!
- What's the matter?

469
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,800
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!

470
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,440
We can't picnic withoutyour host.
Come up to town tomorrow.

471
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,880
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.

472
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,760
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.

473
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,160
Upon my soul,
this is all very unusual.

474
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:42,200
- Frailty, thy name is Brandon.
- Some cannot bear pleasure.

475
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,640
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.

476
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:53,400
Why? Everyone speaks well of him,
but no one remembers to talk to him.

477
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,080
Nonsense. He is highly respected
at Barton Park.

478
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,000
- Which is enough censure in itself.
- Really, Willoughby.

479
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,880
Come, come, Mr. Impudence.
I know your wicked ways.

480
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:13,440
Reveal your beau. No secrets between
friends. I'll winkle it out of you.

481
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:20,680
I'll have you married to the colonel
by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet.

482
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,520
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?

483
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,320
Because he threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine.

484
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,520
He found fault with my high flyer
and will not buy my brown mare.

485
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,000
If it will be
of satisfaction to you, -

486
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,960
- I believe his character to be. in
all other respects, irreproachable.

487
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:51,480
In return for this acknowledgement,
don't deny me the privilege -

488
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,080
- of disliking him
as much as I adore ...

489
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,440
... this cottage.

490
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:09,720
- I have plans for improvements.
- That. I will never consent to.

491
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,960
Not a stone must be added
to its walls.

492
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:19,120
Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild
Combe Magna to this exact image.

493
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:25,600
- With a fire that smokes?
- Especially the fire that smokes.

494
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,600
Then I'd be as happy at Combe
as I've been at Barton.

495
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:36,280
But this place has one claim on
my affections none other can share.

496
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,640
Promise never to change it.

497
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:51,160
I'm honoured you risk your honour by
seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

498
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:56,600
- That is what Elinor would say.
- And she would be right.

499
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:02,040
Miss Marianne, will you grant me
an interview tomorrow ... alone?

500
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,600
- Willoughby, we are always alone.
- But there is ...

501
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,800
There is something very particular
I should like to ask you.

502
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,720
Of course. I shall ask Mamma
if I may stay behind from church.

503
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,880
Thank you.

504
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,600
Until tomorrow. then.

505
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,040
Oh. Virtue ...

506
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:46,080
Silently and with fear, enter the
hearts of all that hear me this day.

507
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,200
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

508
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,680
They always kneel down.

509
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,560
What is wrong, dearest?

510
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,320
Willoughby?
What is the matter?

511
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,120
Forgive me ...
I am sent ...

512
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,480
Lady Allen exercised the privilege
of riches upon a dependent cousin.

513
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,280
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?

514
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:35,960
What a disappointment. Your business
won't detain you for long, I hope?

515
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:41,960
You are kind. but I have no idea of
returning immediately to Devonshire.

516
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:47,840
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait foryour invitation?

517
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:57,400
My engagements are of such a
nature ... I dare not flatter my ...

518
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:02,640
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.

519
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,680
Willoughby, come back!

520
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,000
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea
for Marianne.

521
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,960
- What is wrong, my love?
- Do not ask me questions.

522
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,960
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.

523
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:32,360
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves
of his regard for Marianne.

524
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,280
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?

525
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,760
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?

526
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:49,000
- Why was his manner so guilty?
- You think he's been acting a part?

527
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,680
- No. He loves her. I am sure.
- Of course!

528
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,680
Has he left her any assurance
of his return?

529
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,440
Ask if he proposed.

530
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:05,600
No! I cannot force a confidence
from Marianne. Neither should you.

531
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,600
We must trust her to confide in us
in her own time.

532
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,320
There was something underhand
in his manner.

533
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,000
You will think the worst of him.

534
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,920
I give him the benefit of my
good opinion. He deserves no less.

535
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,800
I am very fond of Willoughby.

536
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,280
Mamma ... Mamma!

537
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,080
She would not let me in.

538
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:25,840
- If only this rain would stop.
- If only youwould stop.

539
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,000
'Twas you took her off my hands,
Mr. Palmer. A good bargain, too.

540
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:36,920
Now I have the whip hand over you,
for you cannot give her back.

541
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,840
Marianne, play with us. Looking at
the weather will not bring him back.

542
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,080
- She ate nothing at dinner.
- We're all forlorn these days.

543
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:56,000
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now
we might haveyour ... discussion.

544
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,000
-your discussion?
- I've longed to ask you something.

545
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:07,600
You might think me impertinent.
It is an odd question.

546
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,920
If only he'd gone to Combe Magna.
We live but half a mile away.

547
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:19,360
- Five and a half.
- I cannot believe it is that far.

548
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,440
- I can't believe it.
- Try.

549
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:31,800
You may ask any manner of question
if that is of any help.

550
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:38,040
Are you acquainted with your
sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?

551
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:44,160
Fanny's mother?
No. I have never met her.

552
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:50,680
You must think me strange to ask.
If only I dared tell ...

553
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,200
If she tells you of the famous
Mr. F, you must pass it on.

554
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:02,000
Will you take a turn with me,
Miss Dashwood?

555
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:10,760
I had no idea you were at all
connected with that family.

556
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,160
I am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars
at present.

557
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:22,520
But the time may come when we
may be very intimately connected.

558
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,000
What do you mean?

559
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,880
Do you have an understanding
with Fanny's brother Robert?

560
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:37,880
The youngest? No.
I have never met him in my life.

561
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:43,320
- With Edward.
- Edward Ferrars?

562
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:49,480
Edward and I have been
secretly engaged these five years.

563
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,680
You may well be surprised.

564
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:02,160
I only mention it because I entirely
trust you to keepyour secret.

565
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:07,000
Edward looks on you
quite as his own sister.

566
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,280
I am sorry.
Surely we ...

567
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,440
We surely do not mean
the same Mr. Ferrars.

568
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:23,840
Yes. He was under the tutelage
of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

569
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,520
- Has he never spoken of it?
- Yes ... Yes. I believe he has.

570
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:38,680
I wanted his mother's approval,
but we loved each other so much.

571
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:47,920
You must have seen how capable he is
of making a woman attached to him.

572
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,080
I cannot pretend it has not
been hard on both of us.

573
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,080
We can scarcely meet
above twice a year.

574
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,640
You seem out of sorts.
Are you quite well?

575
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:17,880
- I have not offended you?
- I must know what you are saying.

576
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:25,000
- Promise me you'll not tell a soul.
- Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

577
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,760
I give you my word.

578
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:34,160
- What has so fascinated you?
- Tell us all!

579
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:41,240
- We were talking of London.
- Do you hear that, Charlotte?

580
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,400
- Charlotte and I concocted a plan.
- The best plan in the world!

581
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,040
I make for London shortly,
and I invite you, Lucy, -

582
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,880
- and both the Misses Dashwood
to join me.

583
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,400
Can I go?

584
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:07,280
You will all come to my Chelsea home
and taste of the season's delights.

585
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,120
Please, can I go?

586
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:17,000
- Do you not long for it to be so?
- I came here with no other view.

587
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:25,560
- We can't leaveyour mother.
- She can spare you very well.

588
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:30,440
- Of course she can!
- I could not be more delighted.

589
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,800
I will brook no refusal.
Let us strike hands on the bargain.

590
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:42,280
If I don't have you married by
Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.

591
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,240
I've never been so grateful.

592
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,600
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward.

593
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,880
- Are you asleep?
- With you in the room?

594
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:12,040
You can't feel as calm as you look.
Oh, I will never sleep tonight.

595
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,440
What were you and Miss Steele
talking about so long?

596
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,480
Nothing of significance.

597
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:42,440
How do you think I like poking about
in that big house without Charlotte?

598
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:49,320
I wrote to Edward, yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

599
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:54,800
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

600
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,640
My only comfort has been
the constancy of his affection.

601
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:04,520
You're fortunate never to have had
any doubts on that score.

602
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:11,480
I am of a jealous nature. Had he
talked more of one young woman ...

603
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,440
But he's not given a moment's alarm
on that count.

604
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,360
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

605
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,840
- Have you missed me, Pigeon?
- Very much, ma'am.

606
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,520
- Is everything in order?
- I suggest the ordering of coal.

607
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:43,120
There you are, Pooter.
Still alive, I see ... Tea, Pigeon.

608
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:49,560
You do not waste any time.
Give it to Pigeon.

609
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:58,080
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will
buy her wedding clothes in town.

610
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:03,960
John and Fanny are in town.
We should be forced to see them.

611
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,120
I think it was for next door.

612
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:21,560
Sit down for two seconds.
You're making me nervous.

613
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,920
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

614
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,160
Indeed it is.

615
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,640
Excuse me. Colonel.

616
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,480
Colonel ...

617
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,640
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

618
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,440
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

619
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,360
I have heard
reports through town ...

620
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,240
Tell me once and for all:

621
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,720
Is everything resolved between
your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

622
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:29,240
Though neither one has informed me
of their understanding, -

623
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:34,600
- I have no doubt
of their mutual affection.

624
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,360
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

625
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,560
To your sister
I wish all imaginable happiness.

626
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:49,680
To Mr. Willoughby, that
he may endeavour to deserve her.

627
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,640
What do you mean?

628
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,800
Forgive me ...

629
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,760
Forgive me.

630
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:21,480
- Where is dear Edward. John?
- And who is Edward?

631
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:26,400
My brother.
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

632
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,520
Ferrars with an F?

633
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,760
Are there any messages?
No message at all? No cards?

634
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:46,080
- You do not ask for your messages.
- No, for I do not expect any.

635
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:50,120
I have
very little acquaintance in town.

636
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:11,280
Not another word about the ham bone.
You and Cartwright sort it out.

637
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:16,840
- No messages.
- Do not fret, my dear.

638
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,840
This good weather is keeping
many a sportsman in the country.

639
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,160
But the frost will soon
drive them to town. Depend on it.

640
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,440
I had not thought of that.

641
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,520
And Miss Dashwood
may set her heart at rest, -

642
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:39,200
- for your sister-in-law is inviting
Mr. F to the ball tonight.

643
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:40,600
Do be careful.
the horses have been here.

644
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,240
Do be careful.
the horses have been here.

645
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,040
It is beginning to rain also.
Follow me.

646
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,360
Mamma!
This is very merry!

647
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,600
- Do you spy anyone we know?
- No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.

648
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,520
- Do you see anyone we know?
- Unfortunately not.

649
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:38,040
How can you be such a tease?
There is Mrs. John Dashwood.

650
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,760
Come along, my dears.

651
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,920
There you are!

652
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,520
How hot it is ...
You are not alone. I trust?

653
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:59,240
John is just gone
to fetch my brother.

654
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:05,440
Your brother! I declare.
this is good news, indeed.

655
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,480
I shall faint clean away.

656
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,520
Mrs. Jennings, I am pleased
to meet you. My brother-in-law ...

657
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,840
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

658
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,680
Miss Dashwood.
Miss Steele. Miss Marianne.

659
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,680
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

660
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,360
You must be the younger brother.
Is Mr. Edward not here?

661
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:36,280
- Miss Dashwood was counting on him.
- He is far too busy.

662
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,560
There's no special acquaintance here
to make his attendance worthwhile.

663
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:47,040
What are the men about these days?
Are they in hiding?

664
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:54,320
In the absence of your brother
you must dance with Miss Dashwood.

665
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,440
It would be my honour.

666
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:11,880
Perhaps Miss Steele might consider
reserving the allemande?

667
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:54,680
You reside in Devonshire.
Miss Dashwood!

668
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,960
- In a cottage!
- Yes.

669
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:07,000
I am excessively fond of a cottage.

670
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:12,200
If I had an money to spare,
I should build one myself.

671
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,080
Mr. Willoughby ...

672
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,880
- How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
- Very well.

673
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:34,640
- How is our family?
- We are all extremely well.

674
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:39,320
Thank You for our kind inquiry.

675
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,360
Willoughby!

676
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,800
Good God, Willoughby ...

677
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,440
Will you not shake hands with me

678
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,400
How do you do, Miss Marianne

679
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,440
What is the matter?
Why have you not come to see me?

680
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,120
Were you not in London?
Have you not received my letters?

681
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,960
I had the pleasure of receiving
the information you sent to me.

682
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,400
For heaven's sake, Willoughby,
tell me what is wrong.

683
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,200
Thank you. I am most obliged.

684
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:38,840
Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.

685
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,680
Go to him.
Force him to come to me instantly.

686
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,720
You must come away.

687
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:14,160
- Do you know them?
- Acquaintances from the country.

688
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:25,680
Come away, dearest.

689
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:36,960
I do not understand.
I must speak to him ...

690
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:41,720
M goodness. Come, dear.
You need some air.

691
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,000
Luc!
We must go.

692
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:03,160
It would be your pleasure
to escort your young charge home.

693
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,560
How kind.

694
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:10,720
She actually sent him messages
during the night

695
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,480
- Marianne, please tell me.
- Do not ask me questions.

696
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:32,600
- You have no confidence in me.
- You confide in no one.

697
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:39,000
- I have nothing to tell.
- We neither of us do.

698
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:44,320
I, because I conceal nothing. You,
because you communicate nothing.

699
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:55,680
Lady Charter is ought to limit her
invitation list. It was very warm.

700
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,920
I am glad we left early.

701
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,480
There now ...

702
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:12,440
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal.
That letter will do the trick.

703
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:19,120
I must be off. I do hope he doesn't
keep her waiting much longer.

704
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,000
It hurts to see her this way.

705
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,840
What a welcome I had
from Edward's family.

706
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,280
You never said how agreeable
our sister-in-law is. Robert, also.

707
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:39,920
It is fortunate that none of them
knows of our engagement.

708
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:54,960
"'Dear Madam. I am at a loss to see
how I might have offended you."

709
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:00,560
"lf I have given rise to a belief of
more than I meant to express, -

710
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,440
- I regret
not having been more guarded."

711
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,480
"My affections
are engaged elsewhere."

712
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:13,280
"It is with regret that I return
your letters and the lock of hair."

713
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,040
"l am, et cetera, John Willoughby."

714
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,840
Dearest ...

715
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:32,160
It is better than if your engagement
had carried on before he ended it.

716
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,040
We're not engaged.

717
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,880
I thought he left you
with some kind of understanding.

718
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:46,840
- He's not so unworthy as you think.
- Did he tell you that he loved you?

719
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:55,360
Yes. No ... Never absolutely.
It was implied but never declared.

720
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:00,400
Sometimes I thought it had been,
but it never was. He broke no vow.

721
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,000
He made us all believe he loved you.

722
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:10,800
He did! He loved me as I loved him.

723
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:18,360
I had to come straight up.
How are you, Miss Marianne

724
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:23,120
Poor thing, she looks very bad.
No wonder. for it is but too true.

725
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,680
I was told by Miss Morton, -

726
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,280
- that he is soon to marry
a Miss Grey with 50,000!

727
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:37,760
If true, he is a good-for-nothing
who used my young friend ill.

728
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,000
And I wish with all my soul that his
wife might plague all his heart out.

729
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:48,040
He's not the only young man
worth having.

730
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,280
With your pretty face
You'll never want for admirers.

731
01:23:55,240 --> 01:24:00,000
Better let her have her cry out
and have done with it.

732
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,560
I will go look out something
to tempt her.

733
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:09,840
- Does she care for olives?
- I cannot tell you.

734
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,880
Apparently, they never were engaged.

735
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:24,320
Miss Grey has 50,000.
Marianne is virtually penniless.

736
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:29,240
She couldn't expect him to go
through with it. But I feel for her.

737
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,480
She will lose her bloom
and end a spinster like Elinor.

738
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:40,440
We might have them to stay for a
few days. We are, after all, family.

739
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,800
- And my father ...
- My love ...

740
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,760
I would ask them with all my heart,
but I've already asked Miss Steele.

741
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,920
And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings
of all her company.

742
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:56,160
We can invite your sisters
some other year.

743
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,440
Miss Steele will profit more
from your generosity, poor girl.

744
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,400
Excellent notion.

745
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,640
Colonel Brandon to see you.

746
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:18,360
- Thank you so much for coming.
- How is your sister?

747
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:25,360
I must get her home. Palmer can take
us to Cleveland, a day from Barton.

748
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:33,200
- I'll take you to Barton myself.
- I confess, that is what I hoped.

749
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,960
Marianne suffers cruelly.

750
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:44,080
What pains me most is how hard
she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

751
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,640
Perhaps ...

752
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:57,800
Ma I relate some circumstances
which only a desire to be useful ...

753
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:02,120
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

754
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,680
When I quitted Barton last ...

755
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:18,520
No, I must go further back.

756
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:23,280
No doubt ...
No doubt ...

757
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,880
... Mrs. Jennings has appraised you
of certain events in my past.

758
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:34,040
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

759
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,720
What is not commonly known -

760
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:45,680
- is that 20 years ago,
before she died. Eliza bore a child.

761
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,800
The father. whoever he was.
abandoned them.

762
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:55,840
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me
to look after the child.

763
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,240
I had failed her in ever other way,
I could not refuse her now.

764
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:06,400
I placed the child, Beth,
with a family in the country -

765
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:11,800
- where I knew she would be looked
after. I saw her whenever I could.

766
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,240
She grew up so headstrong, -

767
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:21,560
- and, God forgive me,
I allowed her too much freedom.

768
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,920
Almost a year ago she disappeared.

769
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:29,600
I instigated a search, but for
eight months I imagined the worst.

770
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:35,240
On the day of the Delaford picnic,
I received the first news of her.

771
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,520
She was ... with child.

772
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:46,280
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts ...

773
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:56,120
Do you mean Willoughby?

774
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:03,560
Before I could confront him.
Lady Allen had turned him out.

775
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:08,280
- He fled to London.
- He left without any explanation.

776
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:15,560
He risked losing the estate, and the
money that remained to his debtors.

777
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,760
So he abandoned Marianne -

778
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,280
- for Miss Grey
and her 50.000.

779
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,280
Is Beth still in town?

780
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,960
She has chosen to go to the country
for her confinement.

781
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:45,440
I would not burden you,
had I not, from my heart, -

782
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,600
- believed it might, in time,
lessen our sister's regrets.

783
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:06,040
I have described Mr. Willoughby
as the worst of libertines.

784
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:11,440
But I learned from Lady Allen that
he did mean to propose that day.

785
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:19,040
I cannot deny that his intentions
towards Marianne were honourable.

786
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,960
I feel certain
that he would have married her.

787
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:30,000
- Had it not been ...
- For the money.

788
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:40,320
- Was I right to tell you?
- Of course.

789
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,120
Whatever his past actions,
whatever his present course, -

790
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:51,760
- you may be certain
that he loved you.

791
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,240
But not enough.

792
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:58,440
Not enough ...

793
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,640
Here is someone to cheer you up.

794
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:18,280
How is our dear sister
Poor thing.

795
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:23,240
I do not know what I'd do if a man
treated me with so little respect.

796
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,880
Are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny?

797
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:32,960
I was never so happy in my life.
Your sister-in-law has taken to me.

798
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:37,920
- You cannot imagine what happened.
- No. I cannot.

799
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:45,160
Yesterday I was introduced to his
mother. She was more than civil.

800
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:50,920
I have not yet seen Edward,
but I feel sure to, very soon.

801
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,320
There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you.

802
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:04,920
Do ask him to come in.

803
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:44,960
What a pleasure to see you.
You know Miss Steele. of course.

804
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:55,920
- How do you do, Miss Steele
- I am well, thank you.

805
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:01,360
Do sit down.

806
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,400
Are you surprised to find me here
and not at your sister's house?

807
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:18,040
Let me fetch Marianne. She would be
disappointed to miss you.

808
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,880
Edward! I heard your voice.

809
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:29,160
- At last you found us.
- My visit is shamefully overdue.

810
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:35,120
- You're pale. Are you not well?
- Don't think of me. Elinor is well.

811
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:41,440
- That is enough for both of us.
- How do you enjoy London?

812
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:48,240
The sight of you is all the pleasure
it has afforded. Is that not so?

813
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,760
- Why have you not visited before?
- I have been engaged elsewhere.

814
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,480
But what was that when there were
such friends to be met?

815
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:04,360
Perhaps you think young men
never honour their engagements

816
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:09,440
Edward is the most incapable of
being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

817
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:18,640
Edward, will you not sit?
Help me to persuade him.

818
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:31,080
- Forgive me. I must take m leave.
- You are only just arrived.

819
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,400
I've an urgent commission for Fanny.

820
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,520
Perhaps you might escort me
back to your sister's house.

821
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:45,120
It would be an honour.

822
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:08,920
- Why did you not urge him to stay?
- He must have had his reasons.

823
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:15,880
Yes, our coldness. Were I Edward,
I'd assume you didn't care for me.

824
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:25,720
Marianne looked badly. It makes me
fear that I shall never marry.

825
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:30,560
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than the Dashwood girls.

826
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:33,840
But I have no dowry.

827
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,400
There are other important qualities
that you have in abundance.

828
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:44,720
It would not surprise me if you
married beyond your expectations.

829
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,720
Oh, I wish that might be so.

830
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,880
There is a young man ...

831
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:57,040
Is he of good fortune and breeding?

832
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:02,720
Of both. But his family
would certainly oppose the match.

833
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,400
The will allow it
as soon as they see you.

834
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,280
It is a very great secret.

835
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:15,360
I've told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery.

836
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:21,600
- I am the soul of discretion.
- If I dared tell ...

837
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:28,400
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

838
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,800
Viper in my bosom!

839
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,880
Stop this!

840
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:06,040
What a commotion! Edward Ferrars.
the one I used to joke you about, -

841
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:11,160
- is engaged these five ears
to Luc Steele.

842
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:18,760
His mother has demanded he break the
engagement or suffer disinheritance.

843
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:24,040
But he refuses to break his promise.
He has stood b her, -

844
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:30,000
- and is cut off without a penny.
She settled it all on Mr. Robert.

845
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:36,600
I must find Luc. Your sister-in-law
drove her to hysteria.

846
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:42,280
How long have you known?

847
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:49,520
- Since Mrs. Jennings invited us.
- Why did you not tell me?

848
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:52,760
Lucy told me in confidence.

849
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:56,680
- I could not break m word.
- He loves you!

850
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:01,880
- He tried to tell me about Luc.
- He cannot marry her.

851
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:07,600
Should he treat her worse
than Willoughby treated you?

852
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:14,080
- He can't marry without love.
- He promised a long time ago.

853
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:22,480
He ma harbour some regret, but he
he will be happy he kept his word.

854
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:30,640
It is bewitching to think one's
happiness depends on one person, -

855
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,280
- but it is not always possible.
We must accept.

856
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:40,720
Edward will marry Lucy,
and you and I will go home.

857
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,720
Always resignation and acceptance.

858
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:47,920
Always prudence and honour and duty.

859
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,440
Elinor, where is your heart?

860
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:56,400
What do you know of my heart,
or anything but your own suffering?

861
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:01,520
For weeks this has been pressed
on me, when I could not speak of it.

862
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:08,400
Forced on me by the person whose
prior claims ruined all my hopes.

863
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:13,320
I endured her exaltation, knowing
I was divided from Edward forever.

864
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:18,960
If not bound to silence. I'd have
produced proof of a broken heart.

865
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:52,280
I have heard your Mr. Ferrars
has lost his fortune to his brother.

866
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:57,720
- Have I been rightly informed?
- It is indeed so.

867
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:05,120
- Are you acquainted with him?
- No. we have never met.

868
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:09,960
But I know only too well
the cruelty ...

869
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:16,120
... of dividing two young people
long attached to one another.

870
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:24,480
I have a proposal that may allow him
to marry Miss Steele immediately.

871
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:29,240
As he is a friend to your family,
perhaps you'd mention it to him.

872
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:38,000
I'm sure he'd be delighted
to hear it from your own lips.

873
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:42,480
I think not.

874
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:48,920
His behaviour has proved him proud.
In the best sense.

875
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:52,960
I feel certain
this is the right course.

876
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,520
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

877
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,920
Thank you for responding so quickly.

878
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,880
I was grateful
to receive your message.

879
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,040
God knows what you must think of me.

880
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:27,000
- I have no right to speak ...
- I have good news.

881
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:30,040
Do please sit down.

882
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:39,960
- You know of Col. Brandon.
- I've heard his name.

883
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:46,000
Col. Brandon desires me to say,
as you wish to join the clergy, -

884
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:51,760
- that he has pleasure in offering
you the parish at Delaford, -

885
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,160
- in the hope it may enable
you and Miss Steele to marry.

886
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:00,920
- Col. Brandon!
- Yes.

887
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:07,640
He means it as testimony of his
concern for this cruel situation.

888
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,520
Col. Brandon give me a parish!

889
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:17,080
Can it be possible

890
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:23,640
You shouldn't be astonished to find
friendship outside your family.

891
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:29,280
No.
Not to find it in you.

892
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:34,320
I cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that I owe this.

893
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,400
I'd express it if I could,
but I am no orator ...

894
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:44,440
You are mistaken.
You owe it to your own merit.

895
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:52,880
Col. Brandon must be a man
of great worth.

896
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:57,320
He is the kindest and best of men.

897
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:04,520
May I ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself?

898
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:10,160
I think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend.

899
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:19,640
Your friendship has been
the most important in m life.

900
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,400
You will always have it.

901
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,240
Forgive me.

902
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:38,440
You honour your promises. That is
more important than anything else.

903
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:42,880
I wish you both happiness.

904
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,920
What luck for them
to find a parish so close to Barton.

905
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:29,160
You'll all be able to meet
very often.

906
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:34,040
I've never disliked a person so much
as I do Mr. Willoughby.

907
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:41,400
We can see his house from the hill!
I'll ask Jackson to plant trees.

908
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:43,600
You won't.

909
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:48,480
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown
was everything of the finest ...

910
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:05,560
Mrs. Bunting!
We're in desperate need of tea.

911
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:17,400
She's not drawn breath since London.
Had I only found another way home.

912
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:23,840
There was no other way. I'll just
take a stroll. A moment's peace.

913
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,520
- I think it is going to rain.
- No. it will not rain.

914
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:34,480
- When you say so, it always does.
- I shall keep to the garden.

915
01:44:53,360 --> 01:45:02,240
We are very proud of your Thomas.
His papa has such a way with him.

916
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:18,760
Oh, there you are.
Come and meet little Thomas.

917
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:37,040
I cannot see Marianne.

918
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:20,360
Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds. -

919
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:25,680
- or bends with the remover
to remove.

920
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:30,840
Oh. no. It is an ever fixed mark -

921
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,560
- that looks on tempests
and is never shaken.

922
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:40,560
Willoughby ...

923
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,920
Willoughby ...

924
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:48,040
Willoughby ...

925
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:53,720
Marianne!

926
01:46:53,880 --> 01:47:00,320
- She'll be wet through.
- Thank you for pointing that out.

927
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,240
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.
Brandon will find her.

928
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:09,040
We can all guess where she went.

929
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:40,600
She's not hurt.
but we must get her warm.

930
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:45,680
There is a fire lit in m room.
Do hurry!

931
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:16,040
I think Marianne ma need
a doctor.

932
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:41,240
You'll wear yourself out. A day or
two in bed will set her to rights.

933
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:47,600
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel.
I've never found a better physician.

934
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:54,760
- What is the diagnosis?
- It is an infectious fever.

935
01:48:54,920 --> 01:49:00,760
- I recommend removing your child.
- Mrs. Bunting!

936
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:14,000
Miss Dashwood ...
I am more sorry than I can say.

937
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:19,720
- If you prefer me to sta I shall.
- That is very kind.

938
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:24,000
But Col. Brandon and Dr. Harris
will look after us.

939
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:27,440
Thank you for all you have done.

940
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:58,800
She's not doing as well
as I would like.

941
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,880
What can I do

942
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:22,400
- You've done so much already.
- Anything, or I shall run mad.

943
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:26,800
She would be easier
if her mother were here.

944
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,040
I must fetch more laudanum.

945
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:18,680
I cannot pretend that your sister's
condition is not very serious.

946
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,200
You must prepare yourself.

947
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:29,880
I will return shortly.

948
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:48,240
Marianne ...

949
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:51,720
Marianne, please try ...

950
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:56,080
Marianne ...

951
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:02,160
Please try ...

952
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:17,480
I cannot ...
I cannot do without you.

953
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:30,360
I've tried to bear everything else.
I will try ...

954
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:35,240
But please, dearest ...

955
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,880
... beloved Marianne ...

956
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:49,280
... do not leave me alone.

957
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,760
Elinor ...

958
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,280
M mother ...

959
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:23,840
She is out of danger.
She is out of danger.

960
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:39,080
- Where is Elinor?
- I'm here.

961
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:42,360
Dearest. I am here.

962
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:49,760
Col. Brandon ...

963
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:59,920
Thank ou.

964
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:45,280
He's not so dashing as Willoughby,
but he has a pleasing countenance.

965
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:51,120
There was something in Willoughby's
eyes at times that I did not like.

966
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:58,720
"Nor is the earth the lesse.
or loseth aught."

967
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:06,560
"What from one place doth fall is
with the tide to another brought."

968
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:13,080
"For there is nothing lost
but may be found ...

969
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:17,120
... if sought."

970
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:25,000
- Shall we continue tomorrow
- No, for I must away.

971
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:31,200
- Away! Where?
- That I cannot tell you.

972
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,960
It is a secret.

973
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,040
You will not stay away long

974
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:59,400
There.

975
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:05,840
There I fell.
and there I first saw Willoughby.

976
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,840
Poor Willoughby.
He will always regret you.

977
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:16,400
Does it follow that. had he chosen
me he would have been content

978
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,920
He would have had a wife he loved.
but no money, -

979
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:27,760
- and might have learned to rank
his Pocketbook above his heart.

980
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:36,040
If his regrets are half as painful
as mine, he will suffer enough.

981
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:41,880
Do you compare
your conduct with his?

982
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:48,240
I compare it to what it
ought to have been. With yours.

983
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:04,000
I fetched those beef fillets. Ma'am.

984
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:10,040
Beef is less expensive in Exeter.
Anyway, it's for Marianne.

985
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:13,920
- Was Exeter crowded?
- It was. Ma'am.

986
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:19,560
Miss Pothington
has had another stroke.

987
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:23,720
And Miss Murden has turned away
Coles for his drunkenness.

988
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:29,200
And Mr. Ferrars is married.
but of course you know that.

989
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:35,000
Who told you he was married

990
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:42,600
I saw Mrs. Ferrars myself. She and
Mr. Ferrars stopped at the inn.

991
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:47,160
I saw it was Miss Steele.
so I took off my hat.

992
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:51,920
She inquired after all of you,
especially Miss Dashwood.

993
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:59,720
She bade me give their compliments.
They're sending a piece of the cake.

994
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:06,240
- Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?
- She said she was vastly contented.

995
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:11,360
As she was always an affable lady,
I made free to wish her joy.

996
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,720
Thank you, Thomas.

997
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:48,640
- What is it. Thomas!
- I'm not sure, but it's heavy.

998
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:55,040
"It is small enough for the parlour.
When I follow shortly, I expect -

999
01:59:55,200 --> 02:00:00,640
- that you've learnt the enclosed.
Your friend, Christopher Brandon."

1000
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,200
It fits perfectly.

1001
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,560
Here you are, Miss Marianne.

1002
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:10,360
Fetch some tea.

1003
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:16,720
- He must like you very much.
- It's for all of us.

1004
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:05,640
Here is Col. Brandon.

1005
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:21,720
- I do not think it is the colonel.
- He said he would arrive today.

1006
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:25,200
Edward!

1007
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:28,240
It is Edward!

1008
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:33,680
Calm.
We must be calm.

1009
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:56,600
Mr. Ferrars for you, ma'am.

1010
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:04,600
Edward ...
What a pleasure to see you.

1011
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:27,320
- I trust I find you all well
- Thank you. We are all very well.

1012
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:37,040
We've been enjoying fine weather ...
Well. we have .

1013
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:44,120
I'm glad to hear it.
The roads were very dry.

1014
02:02:47,720 --> 02:02:53,240
I wish you great joy, Edward.

1015
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:13,960
I hope
you have left Mrs. Ferrars well.

1016
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:19,440
Tolerably ... Thank you.

1017
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,080
Is Mrs. Ferrars at the new Parish?

1018
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:31,240
No ... my mother is in town.

1019
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:34,920
I meant Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

1020
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:42,040
You've not heard?

1021
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:48,000
I think you mean my brother.
Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

1022
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:54,480
- Mrs. Robert Ferrarsy
- Yes.

1023
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:01,800
I received a letter
from Miss Steele. -

1024
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:08,520
- or Mrs. Ferrars, I should say,
communicating to me -

1025
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:13,800
- the transfer of her affections
to my brother Robert.

1026
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:18,360
It seems they were much
thrown together in London.

1027
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:24,640
In view of my new circumstances
I felt it only right -

1028
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:29,200
- that she be released
fromyour engagement.

1029
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:34,200
At any rate, they were married
last week in Plmouth.

1030
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:42,280
Then you ...

1031
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:46,880
... are not married?

1032
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:50,760
No.

1033
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,680
Elinor ...
I met Lucy when I was very young.

1034
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:28,160
Had I had a profession, I would not
have felt such an idle inclination.

1035
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:34,800
At Norland, I convinced myself that
you felt only friendship for me, -

1036
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:38,800
- and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

1037
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:45,560
I have come with no expectations,
only to express, now I am able, -

1038
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:52,800
- that my heart is,
and always will be ...

1039
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:57,880
... yours.

1040
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:16,080
- He's sitting next to her.
- What else?

1041
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:18,960
Tell us!

1042
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:22,880
He's kneeling down!
