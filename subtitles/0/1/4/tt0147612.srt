1
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,735
Andy?

2
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:56,544
Are you okay?

3
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,917
Yes.

4
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:03,385
Sure. I'm fine.

5
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,615
Good.

6
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:10,115
Well, I had a really nice time.

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,993
Yeah. Me, too.

8
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:16,897
Of course, you know I've always
had a really nice time with you.

9
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,798
Same here.

10
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:22,703
But...

11
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:23,797
Yeah?

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,207
- You understand?
- Uh-huh.

13
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:33,038
Well, the food here
was excellent.

14
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:36,280
I'm gonna recommend it
to my sisters.

15
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,787
How many stars did it get?

16
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,483
Three and a half.

17
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:50,999
Oh...

19
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:21,988
Do you feel better now?

20
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:27,335
- Me, too.
- Sorry.

21
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,339
It's really...
It's good we had this talk.

22
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:32,204
Yeah.

23
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:34,767
Before things went too far,
you know?

24
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,608
- Got too serious.
- Yeah.

26
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:54,562
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

27
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,957
Is it someone else?

28
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:01,493
No.
It's just you.

29
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,549
Hey, I want to show you
something I got you.

30
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:25,925
- For me?
- Here, open it up.

31
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,223
But, Andy...

32
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,894
This is...

33
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:44,808
Oh...

34
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,714
Oh, this is beautiful.

35
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:52,846
Thanks.

36
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:56,585
It's a Gainsevoort
reproduction.

37
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:58,287
Boston, late 188O's.

38
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:02,094
I sent away for it right after
we had our...

39
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:03,656
...first date.

40
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,964
Oh, I just love it.
It's...

42
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,530
It's a collector's item.

43
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:12,131
Yeah.

44
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,445
It is pretty special.

46
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:21,506
It almost makes me want
to learn how to smoke.

48
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:35,788
Hey, look at the back.

49
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:38,964
Uhh.

50
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,197
That's a forty-karat,
gold plated,

51
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,967
inlaid base.

52
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:47,568
Oh, Andy, I just love it.
It's...

53
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,976
this really means
something to me.

54
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,144
I'll always treasure it
as... a token.

55
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,278
No you won't.

56
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:03,884
'Cause this is for the girl
who loves me.

57
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:09,564
The girl who cares about me,
for who I am.

58
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:14,027
Not what I look like.

59
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:19,535
I just wanted you to know
what you'd be missing.

60
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:22,306
You think I don't
appreciate art.

61
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:24,711
You think I don't understand
fashion.

62
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:27,147
You think I'm not hip.

63
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:29,344
You think I'm pathetic.

64
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:33,219
A nerd.

65
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:35,816
A lard-ass fatso.

66
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,185
You think I'm shit.

67
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:41,730
Well, you're wrong.

68
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,797
'Cause I'm champagne.

69
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:48,895
And you're shit!

70
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:51,702
And till the day you die...

71
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,140
you...

72
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:55,303
not me...

73
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:58,246
will always be shit.

74
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:24,898
I dunno...

75
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,535
but whenever I see her,
I just wanna...

76
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,805
you know, I wanna...

77
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:35,675
undress her...

78
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:38,644
I wanna tie her up.

79
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:42,990
I wanna pump her...

80
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:47,261
pump, pump, pump,

81
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:48,855
till she screams bloody murder.

82
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,331
And then I wanna...

83
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:55,030
flip her ass over
and pump her even more.

84
00:06:56,272 --> 00:07:00,072
And so hard that my dick
shoots right through her.

85
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:01,974
And that my...

86
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,571
come squirts out her mouth.

87
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:11,645
And not that I could ever...

88
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:17,850
...actually do that.

89
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:25,927
See...

90
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,301
if she only knew how I felt.

91
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,900
Deep down I really
cared for her...

92
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:37,879
respected her...

93
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:42,478
she would love me back.

94
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:46,816
Maybe.

95
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,620
Oh, she doesn't
even know I exist.

96
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:55,255
I mean, she knows I exist...

97
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:58,324
I mean we are neighbors,
you know, we...

98
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,636
you know, smile politely
at each other, but...

99
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,032
I don't know if I could ever
really begin to talk to her,

100
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:09,772
I mean, what could I talk
about?

101
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:12,212
I have nothing to talk about,
I'm boring.

102
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:15,217
That I know.

103
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,151
I've been told before,
so don't tell me it's not true.

104
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:19,654
'Cause it's a fact.
I bore people.

105
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,384
People look at me
and they get bored.

106
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:23,392
People listen to me
and they zone out...

107
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:27,123
...bored.
Who is that boring person?

108
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:28,755
They think...

109
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:31,699
"I have never before met
anyone so boring."

110
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:35,928
And for her to
see how boring I am...

111
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:38,839
A gallon of skim milk.

112
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,605
A dozen eggs...

113
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:46,411
...one of those disposable
cameras for the weekend.

114
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,747
Stop at the 7-11
on the way home...

115
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,849
I got to get the
dry cleaning, for Trish.

116
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:57,416
I've got to check Billy's
homework...

117
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,295
and call Mrs. Mitchell about
her appointment on Tuesday...

118
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:04,026
reschedule the dentist.

119
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,058
But do you know what
I'm gonna do?

120
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:08,434
I gotta get the dog cleaned...

121
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:11,736
The next time I see her...

122
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:14,368
as soon as I see her...

123
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,744
I'm just gonna tell her...

124
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:22,410
I'm gonna tell
her that l, uh...

125
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:24,215
find her...

126
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,718
...attractive.

127
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,068
Good evening, Miss Jordan.

128
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,493
How, how's it going?

129
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:10,055
Okay.


131
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:12,756
- See ya.
- Yeah.

133
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:45,426
I'm gonna fuck you so hard,

134
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:48,191
you'll be coming out
of your ears.

135
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:49,994
Fuck you...

138
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:02,709
Yeah?

139
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,574
No, fuck you.

140
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:10,449
I'll fuck you.
I'll fuck you...

141
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:12,784
...really hard.

142
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:14,722
So hard you won't even...

144
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,894
Hello?

145
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:21,829
Hello, is this Claire?

146
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:23,991
Who is this?

147
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,678
Die, Aunt Joy! Die!

148
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:42,206
- Timmy!
- It's okay, Trish.

149
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,481
He's just going through a
phase. Leave him alone.

150
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,353
- I know, but...
- It's okay. I'm strong enough.

151
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,324
I blame it on cartoons,

152
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:51,952
they are so full of violence.

153
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:54,189
What's with the people
that are making cartoons.

154
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,698
That's what you have to--
Joy?

155
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,996
Joy, what's the matter?

156
00:12:59,035 --> 00:13:02,004
I don't know what it is,
but I feel there's so much...

157
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:05,235
hostility directed at me.

158
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:07,834
Honey, did another guy dump you?

159
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:11,005
No, I--

160
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,708
I just feel terrible.

161
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:15,774
Aww, Sweetie.
Timmy didn't mean it.

162
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:18,582
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I just...

163
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:20,919
I'm overworked, that's all.

164
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:24,216
It's okay.

165
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,455
It's okay, 'cause now
maybe you'll listen to me.

166
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:27,985
What?

167
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,193
- You have got to eat red meat.
- Oh, Trish.

168
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:34,327
I knew that's how you'd react,
but I'm telling you, it's true.

169
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,065
I've been watching you.

170
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:38,096
My doctor says just once
a month.

171
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,198
I know.

172
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,573
Really. It's the best thing
for the skin.

173
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,306
- It'll clear it right up.
- What's wrong with my skin?

174
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,645
Well it's fine now, but...

175
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:49,116
in another few years...

176
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:50,550
Please, Joy.

177
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:52,383
You know I'm just speaking
to you for your own good.

178
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:54,855
I know. I know.
Thanks.

179
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,454
- I'm so happy.
- You are?

180
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,794
Yeah. I mean being
around you and the kids

181
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:05,232
and you know, Kooki.

182
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,360
- You really are?
- Yeah.

183
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:10,998
Oh, honey,
I'm so happy you're happy.

184
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:15,004
'Cause all this time I've been
thinking you were so miserable.

185
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:18,411
Oh, Trish. That's too funny,
when I couldn't be happier.

186
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:20,472
You know, it's just with your
music career--

187
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:21,608
Oh, my career's fine.

188
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,450
Oh, I know. I know, it will be.
I just know it.

189
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:27,513
And then you'll move out
of mom and dad's.

190
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,956
- Real soon.
- And you'll meet Mr. Right.

191
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:31,755
Oh, I will.

192
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:34,319
Already I feel I'm off
to a fresh start.

193
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:36,558
That's right. Just because
you hit thirty

194
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:39,261
doesn't mean you can't be
fresh anymore.

195
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:43,032
You know Joy, I've never told
you this before...

196
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,438
but now that we're older,
and...

197
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:48,466
I feel so bonded to you.

198
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,979
Well, the truth is...

199
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:54,039
I know this is
gonna sound horrible...

200
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,246
but I feel I have to be
open with you,

201
00:14:57,286 --> 00:15:00,084
and get beyond
all the barriers,

202
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:03,614
and the sibling nonsense.

203
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,254
The truth is I always thought
you'd never amount to much.

204
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:11,130
That you would end up alone,
without a career.

205
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,795
It's what we all thought.

206
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:15,997
Mom, Dad, Helen...

207
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:17,665
...everyone.

208
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,936
I always prayed we'd all
be wrong, but,

209
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:23,809
somehow you always seemed
so doomed to failure.

210
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:28,380
But now I see that's not true.

211
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,909
There's a glimmer of hope
for you after all.

212
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:35,890
I'm sorry, I'm repeating
myself.

213
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:39,053
I'm just really happy for you.

217
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:54,799
Psychiatrist:
And how is this different?

218
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:58,295
I don't kill myself at the end.

219
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:02,166
Do you see this
as something positive?

220
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:08,674
Gee, well...
I don't know.

221
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:11,015
How do you feel at the end?

222
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,884
Much better.

223
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:16,448
I wake up happy...

224
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,756
feeling good...

225
00:17:18,794 --> 00:17:23,493
but then I'll get depressed
because I'm living in reality.

226
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:30,233
What about your family?

227
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:32,399
Trish is good to me.

228
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:35,069
But, still no sex.

229
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:37,976
No...

230
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:42,677
but, she's not too interested
either, so...

231
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:47,121
really there's no problem there

232
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:48,521
when you think about it...

233
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:53,093
on a certain level.

235
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:43,104
- Hi.
- Hi, hon, how's work?

236
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,696
Oh, fine.

237
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:49,039
Hey, Billy.
What's going on?

238
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:51,373
Nothing.

239
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,404
He's depressed.

240
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:56,350
- Well is anything the matter?
- I don't want to talk about it.

241
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:58,910
Ignore him.
He just wants attention.

242
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:01,514
He thinks you'll be impressed.

243
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:04,253
So anyway, Joy came by.

244
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:07,694
- How's she doing?
- I dunno, I'm concerned.

245
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,598
She's not like me.
She doesn't have it all.

246
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,363
She pretends to be happy, but,
you can see right through her,

247
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:16,337
she's miserable.

248
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:17,634
Why do you think that?

249
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:20,506
To be frank, she's lazy.

250
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,737
She's not a go-getter.

251
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,245
She's so picky.

252
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:27,373
I gave Damien Ross her
phone number,

253
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:31,375
and Joy sounded interested,
but I dunno.

254
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,753
I'm afraid to say it,
but it's what I believe.

255
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,451
She'll always be alone.

256
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:39,586
- We're all alone.
- Oh, Bill.

257
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:42,096
Sometimes I wonder how any of
your patients can talk to you.

258
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:44,292
Sometimes I wonder
if they'll ever stop.

259
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,324
I should tape some for you.

260
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:48,928
Would you?
Would you really?

261
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:51,303
- So I could listen, too?
- No.

262
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,867
Come on, you're such a tease.
I wouldn't tell anyone.

263
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,606
Right. 'Cause you're
so secretive.

264
00:20:57,646 --> 00:21:00,877
Maybe not as secretive as you.

265
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,079
What secret would you like me
to tell you?

266
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,350
Like how come no matter how
much you treat me like shit...

267
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:09,414
I can't help lovin' you
even more?

268
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:29,299
- Dad?
- Yes, Billy.

269
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,983
What does "cum" mean?

270
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:41,754
"Cum?"

271
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,623
You know...

272
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:55,267
Well, you know sometimes
your penis gets erect?

273
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:59,798
Well, sometimes it gets so
excited that a sticky,

274
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:03,334
milky substance shoots out.

275
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:05,346
Dickwad?

276
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,545
Yes, only "cum" can be used
as a verb as well.

277
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:16,383
- Billy...
- Yeah?

278
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:19,155
Have you ever cum?

279
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:20,388
Yeah.

280
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:27,198
Billy, it's all right
if you haven't.

281
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:28,498
But, I have.

282
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:32,700
- Billy?
- But...

283
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,539
everyone else in class
has and...

284
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:38,102
I want to cum, too.

285
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:45,476
It's okay. It's okay.

286
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:49,252
Have you tried playing
with yourself?

287
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,657
You mean...

288
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:53,627
With your penis.

289
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:57,262
A little.

290
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,392
How did it feel?

291
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:04,296
I don't know.

292
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:07,308
I don't know what to do.

293
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:14,915
Do you want me to show you?

294
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,611
No. No.

295
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:19,644
I'm not normal.

296
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:24,916
Oh, no, Billy.

297
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:30,892
Don't worry, you're normal.

298
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:35,200
Hey...

299
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:38,968
you'll cum one day.

300
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,810
You'll see.

301
00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:57,750
I'm turning on the dishwasher.

302
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:33,286
- Where's my valium?
- What?

303
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:37,022
Never mind.

304
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:40,193
Fuckin' asshole.

306
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:52,370
You answer it, bastard.

307
00:24:52,414 --> 00:24:55,281
Mona, it's Trish.

308
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:03,253
- Hi, Trish.
- Hi, mom. How are you?

309
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,987
Oh, I'm fine.

310
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:07,552
How are you?

311
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:09,587
- Fine.
- Good.

312
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:11,496
Did you watch Leno last night?

313
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:15,530
Mom?

314
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:21,709
He's leaving me.

315
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:25,279
Your father's leaving me.

316
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:27,474
Mom, what are
you talking about?

317
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:32,613
Trish, can you keep
this top secret?

318
00:25:32,654 --> 00:25:34,212
Yes. Yes of course I can, mom.

319
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:37,851
He says...

320
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:40,453
He says he doesn't love
me anymore.

321
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:44,591
- I'm sure he doesn't mean it.
- He does fucking mean it.

322
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:46,191
He wants a divorce.

323
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:48,600
He said the word "divorce"?

324
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:51,401
What? You don't believe me?

325
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,634
- You talk to him, okay? Lenny?
- Yeah.

326
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:55,472
It's Trish, she wants
to talk to you.

327
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,206
- Yeah, Trish?
- Is it true what mom said?

328
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:01,545
- What?
- You want a divorce?

329
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:04,984
Mona, what are you telling
the kids?

330
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,352
She'll call you back.

331
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,923
Did I use the word "divorce"?

332
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:16,692
You... You said you didn't want
to live with me.

333
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:18,996
Answer the question,
did I use the word "divorce"?

334
00:26:19,034 --> 00:26:20,626
You said that you didn't
love me.

335
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:22,762
Did I use the word "divorce"?

336
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,397
No.

337
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,670
Good.
I just wanted to make that clear.

338
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:35,073
Now sit down next to me.
Come on.

339
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,544
Sit down.

340
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:43,120
Sit down!

342
00:26:56,204 --> 00:26:59,264
Lenny, why?

343
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:02,504
I don't know.

344
00:27:02,544 --> 00:27:05,377
I just want to be alone.

345
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:16,850
I can let you be alone more
if that's what you want.

346
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:22,555
It's not that.
Things change...

347
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:26,363
People change.

348
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:29,564
I want out.

349
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:41,878
It's Diane, isn't it?

350
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,942
Diane?

351
00:27:43,985 --> 00:27:45,885
You're in love with Diane
Freed.

352
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:48,116
Oh, get outta here. Please.

353
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:51,922
You're in love with someone.
It's someone younger probably.

354
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,291
- Wrong.
- Lenny...

355
00:27:53,328 --> 00:27:56,195
it's okay, I'm not dumb.

356
00:27:56,231 --> 00:27:58,893
Things happen.
I'll get over it.

357
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:02,768
I wish you had done this
twenty years ago.

358
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:06,672
Now I'll have to get another
fucking face-lift.

359
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:12,780
I'm in love with no one.

360
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:17,082
- With no one?
- No one.

361
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:28,960
Okay, then.

362
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,967
Schmuck.

363
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:36,799
You know people are
always putting New Jersey down.

364
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:38,829
None of my friends can actually
believe I live here.

365
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:41,502
But that's just because
they don't get it.

366
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:44,068
I'm living in a state of irony.

367
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:47,673
Helen, are you sure you don't
want to have dinner with me tonight?

368
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,183
Oh, I can't.

369
00:28:49,217 --> 00:28:52,380
I'm giving another reading
book-signing at Barnes _ Noble,

370
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,150
then Jamal's taking me out,

371
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,090
although I promised Flavio.

372
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,990
I hate Saturday
nights.

373
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:01,689
Everybody wants me, Joy,
you have no idea.

374
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,096
I know, it's that l,

375
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,828
I wrote a new song,
and I thought you'd come over,

376
00:29:06,868 --> 00:29:08,699
- I could play it for you--
- Can you hold on?

377
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:10,568
I'm sorry, Joy, hold on.

378
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:13,233
Hello?

379
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:16,210
Oh, Salman. Hold on one second.

381
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:20,974
Joy, I'm so sorry I have to
take this, it's London.

382
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:24,747
I'll talk to you soon.
Okay, bye-bye.

383
00:29:24,786 --> 00:29:27,016
Bye.


385
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:41,568
Hello?

386
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:44,436
Hi. Um...

387
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:47,032
How are you?

388
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:48,975
Is this...

389
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,910
Damien?

390
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:53,506
Yeah. How ya doin'?

391
00:29:53,548 --> 00:29:57,678
Oh, fine. Trish told me
you might be calling.

392
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,414
Yeah.

393
00:29:59,454 --> 00:30:02,150
Well, I know how
weird these things can be,

394
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,523
but, I've always had such faith
in Trish's judgment,

395
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,289
I just thought, why not?

396
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:09,422
It's not like I have a huge
social life...

397
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:12,194
I do have a social life,
it's just not huge.

398
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:14,326
- Same here.
- Really?

399
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:17,634
That's so nice to hear.
Most people seem so confident.

400
00:30:17,672 --> 00:30:19,196
Yeah.

401
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,370
Or they're real jerks.

402
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:24,537
What are you doing?

403
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:26,547
Oh, I'm sorry.

404
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:28,572
I'm sorry. I just trying
to thaw this steak,

405
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:32,382
and it's so hard, and I...

406
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,854
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

407
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:37,653
Don't stop because of me.

408
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:40,627
Well, I feel I'm being so rude.

409
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:43,187
No, no, Not at all.

410
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:44,858
Well, thanks.

411
00:30:47,535 --> 00:30:49,867
- Are you alone?
- Yeah I'm alone.

412
00:30:49,904 --> 00:30:52,998
Nobody's listening in.
Don't worry.

413
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:56,234
God, you're just like me.

414
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:59,075
- What are you wearing?
- You mean when we go out?

415
00:31:00,715 --> 00:31:02,239
Where do you want to go?

416
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:06,242
I'm pretty easy to please.
I hate getting all dressed up.

417
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,517
What are you wearing now?

418
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:10,658
Just a pair of jeans, why?

419
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:13,718
- Are they tight?
- Not too tight.

420
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:15,423
Actually they fit pretty good.

421
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:17,693
- But why do you want to know...?
- Not the jeans, underneath.

422
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:20,200
What are you wearing
underneath? Check.

423
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:23,662
Underneath? Well...

424
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:27,766
Damien, underneath is just...

425
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:30,274
This isn't Damien, is it?

426
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:33,212
Are you all wet?
Is your pussy all wet?

429
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:46,043
- Who is it?
- It's your neighbor, Kristina.

431
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,725
Hey, what's up?

432
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:55,456
Did you hear what happened
to Pedro?

433
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:59,433
- Who's Pedro?
- You know, the night doorman.

434
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,025
Oh, yeah. What?

435
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:04,300
He was found bludgeoned to death
in his apartment this morning.

436
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:07,672
- Ugh.
- Yeah. And supposedly...

437
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:11,008
- ...his penis was missing.
- Ugh!

438
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:15,038
Anyway, Carla in 2B, she's
collecting money for the funeral,

439
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,108
you know, if you feel like it.

440
00:33:17,152 --> 00:33:20,417
Apparently he had no family.

441
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:23,253
No one, no friends.
If I'd had known.

442
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:26,753
I did always say "hi," I think.

443
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:28,887
Yeah, me, too...

444
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,364
If it's the guy
I'm thinking of.

445
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,363
By the way, I have an extra ticket
to the playoffs tonight.

446
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:39,896
Maybe you want to come with me?

447
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:43,172
Hah, uh... Thanks.

448
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:45,270
I've got too much work.

449
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:48,009
I just wanted to tell you
about Pedro.

450
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:50,643
- Thanks.
- Okay. See ya.

451
00:34:13,107 --> 00:34:16,235
It seems the things
I've wanted in my life

452
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:18,973
I've never had

453
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:24,747
And so it's no surprise that
living only leaves me sad

454
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:27,914
Happiness, where are you?

455
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:31,255
I've searched so long
for you

456
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:34,193
Happiness, what are you?

457
00:34:34,229 --> 00:34:37,528
I haven't got a clue

458
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:42,229
Happiness, why do you
have to stay...

459
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,728
So far away...

460
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:48,139
From me?

461
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:55,749
When I'm in despair and life
has turned into a mess

462
00:34:55,783 --> 00:35:01,619
I know I don't dare to end
my search for happiness

463
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:04,853
Happiness, where are you?

465
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,430
Hello?

466
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:15,163
Hello. This is detective Berman
from the County Police Department.

467
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:17,262
I'd like to speak to
Miss Joy Jordan.

468
00:35:17,305 --> 00:35:20,797
- This is she.
- I'm so sorry, I've got another call.

469
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:22,400
Hello?

470
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:24,468
Yeah, lieutenant.
Hi. How ya doing?

471
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:26,377
They pronounced the guy DOA.

472
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:27,346
The door was locked from
the inside.

473
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:30,249
All the property's here,
suicide note.

474
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:35,416
Looks like a pill vodka OD,
with a bag over his head.

475
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:37,890
Yeah.
Hi, Miss Jordan, I'm back.

476
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:39,825
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Miss Jordan.

477
00:35:39,861 --> 00:35:41,226
But, ah...

478
00:35:41,262 --> 00:35:43,457
I'm afraid I've got some
really bad news for you

479
00:35:43,498 --> 00:35:45,659
in regards
to an acquaintance of yours

480
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,191
by the name of Andrew
Kornbluth.

482
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:55,372
Joy...

483
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,470
Are you okay?

484
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:01,346
Yeah, sure. I'm fine.

485
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:04,382
What's the matter?

487
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:14,553
Andy's dead.

488
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:16,859
- Andy?
- Yeah.

489
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,894
Who's Andy?

490
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,494
You know, the guy
who used to work...

491
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:24,471
right over
there in that corner.

492
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:28,337
- You mean where Pam's sitting?
- Yeah.

493
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:34,704
Was he kind of tall
and a little hunched?

494
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:36,842
No.
He was...

495
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:40,411
a little shortish.
A little squarish.

496
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,056
Joy, I'm not sure.

497
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:47,687
Did he work here long?

498
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:49,924
A year, maybe a little longer.

499
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:54,668
Kay...

500
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:56,636
Kay. Kay.

501
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:59,868
Do you remember a guy named
Andy who used to work here,

502
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:02,171
over where Pam is now?

503
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,509
No. Why?
What happened?

504
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:08,208
- He died.
- Huh.

505
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:11,013
- Which one was he?
- I'm not sure.

506
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:12,986
Maybe Tom knows.
Tom?

507
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,011
I'm sorry, I don't.
But you know,

508
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:19,823
I do remember a guy, vaguely,
who worked over there...

509
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:23,194
I think.
But, I'm not really sure.

510
00:37:23,231 --> 00:37:24,994
How did he die?

511
00:37:25,032 --> 00:37:27,432
Yeah, Joy, how did he die?

513
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:34,672
Sales, may I help you?

514
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:39,009
- Joy Jordan?
- Yes.

515
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:41,412
This is Andy's mother.

516
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:44,111
I hope you fucking rot in hell.

517
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:46,950
Joy, was he kind of
Latino looking?

518
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:49,548
And a little acne scarred?

519
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,821
Oh, yeah. You know, like uh,
what's-his-name.

520
00:37:54,962 --> 00:37:56,395
- The actor...
- Yeah. Sure.

521
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:01,360
That was him.

522
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:03,495
- That's it. That actor.
- What's that actor's name?

523
00:38:03,538 --> 00:38:06,769
- What actor?
- It has an A in it...

524
00:38:06,808 --> 00:38:08,935
it's uh, oh you know,
something, something, something.

525
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:14,906
- Oh, I know.
- I can picture his face.

526
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:15,881
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

528
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,779
Joe something.

529
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,619
If I go thought the alphabet,
I can usually picture their name.

530
00:38:22,657 --> 00:38:23,487
It's um...

531
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:36,869
Uh, I don't know why
I suggested this place.

532
00:38:36,904 --> 00:38:38,804
Joy recommended it.

533
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,375
Well, at least we're together.

534
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,401
I never get to see you,
you're so busy.

535
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,470
- You're so busy.
- No, you are.

536
00:38:46,514 --> 00:38:49,142
- No, you are.
- No, you are.

537
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:53,543
- I guess I am.
- Me, too.

538
00:38:53,588 --> 00:38:56,523
If I have to do one more
interview...

539
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,587
I guess it's hard, huh?

540
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:03,529
Success.

541
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:08,399
I'm just so tired of being
admired all the time.

542
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:10,734
I mean all these men,
they're...

543
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:13,205
...they're beautiful,
artistic minds,

544
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:15,368
great sex, the whole package...

545
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:19,004
...but, hollow.

546
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:20,570
You know what I mean?

547
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:23,209
I feel nobody's honest with me.

548
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,516
Nobody wants me...

549
00:39:26,554 --> 00:39:28,545
...for me.

550
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:31,484
They're not family.

551
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:34,825
Oh, Trish I wish I had
your life.

552
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:37,422
Husband, kids, carpool.

553
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:39,729
I may have it all.

554
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:44,896
But, I wonder what my life might
have been like if I'd actually,

555
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:47,373
tried to write a novel.

556
00:39:49,043 --> 00:39:51,170
I'm sure it would
have been good.

557
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:55,778
Well, maybe I will write one.

558
00:39:56,684 --> 00:39:58,311
You should.

559
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:01,278
Just try.

560
00:40:03,157 --> 00:40:08,356
No. I don't need that kind
of success.

561
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:09,829
Listen to us...

562
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:12,526
we who have everything
while Joy...

563
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:17,396
- ...what does she have?
- You're so right.

564
00:40:17,438 --> 00:40:19,531
She's just getting older.

565
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:25,243
Last night she called while
I was in bed with Huraki...

566
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:26,746
I think.

567
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:28,373
She was in tears.

568
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,385
- She told me she quit her job.
- Oh, God, no.

569
00:40:31,419 --> 00:40:32,977
That's her lifeline.

570
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,545
She said she wanted to change
her life.

571
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,718
Do "good." Work with the poor
and the needy.

572
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:41,389
I don't get it.

573
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:43,397
Don't even try.
She doesn't understand,

574
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,160
she is good.

575
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,224
She doesn't need to do good.

576
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:50,401
What about her music career?

577
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:53,669
I don't know.
But don't hold your breath.

578
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:56,575
Listen, anyway...

579
00:40:56,611 --> 00:41:00,012
this is all top secret.
She doesn't want anyone to know.

580
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:04,643
Oh, but, she told you?

581
00:41:04,685 --> 00:41:07,677
She felt she could trust me.

582
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:09,314
'Cause she always thought
I was someone

583
00:41:09,357 --> 00:41:11,791
that she could confide in.

584
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:18,231
Did you speak to mom?

585
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:19,857
You mean about the split up?

586
00:41:21,168 --> 00:41:22,795
Oh... I...

587
00:41:22,837 --> 00:41:24,998
I thought that was
all top secret?

588
00:41:26,674 --> 00:41:28,505
Just for Joy.

589
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:31,773
Sensitive Joy.
Everyone else knows.

590
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:33,871
Oh.

591
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:35,506
Can I get you ladies anything else?

592
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:38,575
- Coffee? Dessert?
- No thank you, just the check, please.

593
00:41:39,654 --> 00:41:40,518
Thank you.

594
00:41:43,157 --> 00:41:45,091
Thanks for lunch.

595
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:49,596
I really enjoyed this.

596
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:54,799
Benefits! Benefits!
We want benefits!

597
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:58,362
Benefits! Benefits!
We want benefits!

598
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,714
You know, there are people
in real need in there.

599
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:10,239
The fucking management's
in there.

600
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:12,184
What about the refugees?

601
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:15,655
What about our benefits?

602
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:21,925
I'm sorry. I think you're all
making a terrible mistake.

603
00:42:21,962 --> 00:42:24,692
Scab! Scab! Scab...!

605
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:55,023
That's so sad.

606
00:42:56,764 --> 00:42:58,391
I mean, really, it's pathetic.

607
00:42:58,432 --> 00:43:00,263
Such losers.

608
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:02,201
Really, I feel sorry for them.

609
00:43:02,236 --> 00:43:05,000
- What is it? What happened?
- They called me a scab.

610
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:07,735
Oh, you're not a scab.

611
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:09,936
You're a strikebreaker.

612
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:15,413
Good luck.

613
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:23,554
Hello.

614
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:26,958
My name is Joy Jordan.

615
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:48,172
I am your new teacher.

616
00:43:49,283 --> 00:43:52,878
- Now...
- You are scab.

617
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,855
Where Marsha?

618
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:59,252
Marsha? Well...

619
00:43:59,293 --> 00:44:02,421
- Marsha...
- We want Marsha!

620
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:06,126
We want Marsha! We want Marsha!

621
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:09,625
We want Marsha! We want Marsha!

622
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,195
We want Marsha! We want Marsha!

623
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,335
Quiet!

624
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:20,041
Please.

625
00:44:26,053 --> 00:44:30,149
I am not a scab.

626
00:44:30,191 --> 00:44:32,853
I am a strikebreaker.

628
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:45,668
All right.

629
00:44:45,706 --> 00:44:46,468
Good job.

631
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:56,307
Don't fuck this up.

632
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,282
- Come on.
- Let's go, Johnny.

633
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,582
Come on. You can do it.

634
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:40,693
Bill, I don't know.

635
00:45:41,896 --> 00:45:44,126
Maybe I should talk to you.

636
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:46,530
You're supposed to be a specialist
in these things, aren't you?

637
00:45:47,234 --> 00:45:49,395
Well, I don't know.
That depends.

638
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:51,563
Look...

639
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:55,507
...my son's a fag,
I'm not blind to these things.

640
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:59,069
How come you're so sure he's...

641
00:45:59,113 --> 00:46:00,603
...gay?

642
00:46:00,648 --> 00:46:02,240
Are you kidding?

643
00:46:02,283 --> 00:46:06,720
Well, it's just, sometimes
appearances can be deceiving.

644
00:46:06,754 --> 00:46:08,779
And besides,
even if you're right,

645
00:46:08,822 --> 00:46:11,757
there's not much
you can do... is there?

646
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:16,360
What do you think will happen
if I got him uh...

647
00:46:16,397 --> 00:46:18,456
professional, you know?

648
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:22,629
A professional?

649
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,070
Hooker.

650
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,868
One that could
teach him things.

651
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:29,171
First-timers, you know...

652
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:31,439
break him in.

653
00:46:31,478 --> 00:46:33,412
But, Joe...

654
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:34,914
he's eleven.

655
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:44,955
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

656
00:46:46,193 --> 00:46:47,820
It's too late.

657
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:49,624
He is what he is.

658
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:52,325
Forget I said anything.

659
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:56,700
Ah, dad, could Johnny
sleep over tonight?

660
00:46:56,737 --> 00:46:59,570
Well, that's up to Joe.

661
00:46:59,606 --> 00:47:02,074
Daddy, may I please sleep over
at Billy's tonight?

662
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:04,009
Sure. Sure. Whatever.

664
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:09,909
Like girls.

666
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:41,944
Come and get it.

667
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:44,075
Oh, Bill, you shouldn't have.

668
00:47:44,118 --> 00:47:46,382
Here, take.
You only live once.

669
00:47:47,421 --> 00:47:49,548
Billy.

670
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,354
- Here, Johnny.
- No, thank you, Dr. Maplewood.

671
00:47:54,061 --> 00:47:55,323
Aren't you having any?

672
00:47:55,362 --> 00:47:57,796
Johnny hates chocolate fudge.

673
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,500
Well...

674
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,868
Is there something
you'd like instead?

675
00:48:04,905 --> 00:48:07,373
No, thank you, Dr. Maplewood.

676
00:48:07,408 --> 00:48:09,205
What about something to drink?

677
00:48:09,243 --> 00:48:11,074
Leave him alone, honey,
he's fine.

678
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:13,807
No. There must be something.

679
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:16,983
Do you have any grape Hi C?

680
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:18,484
Do we, Trish?

681
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:21,079
I'm afraid not.

682
00:48:21,121 --> 00:48:23,589
- I'll go pick some up.
- Bill, don't be silly.

683
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:25,524
He doesn't need anything,
it's late.

684
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:29,086
Do you have any tuna salad?

685
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,093
Would you like a sandwich?

686
00:48:35,135 --> 00:48:37,262
Yes, please.

687
00:48:44,945 --> 00:48:48,711
We're going to bed.
Timmy can barely keep his eyes open.

688
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:50,478
You boys don't stay up
too late, huh?

689
00:48:50,517 --> 00:48:52,348
Okay.

690
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:58,183
Here we are.

691
00:48:58,225 --> 00:49:00,955
Hey, what happened to Billy?

692
00:49:00,994 --> 00:49:02,154
I don't know.

693
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:04,164
I guess he just conked out.

694
00:49:04,198 --> 00:49:05,995
Bedtime for Billy.
Here we go.

695
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:09,198
Here we go.

696
00:50:15,435 --> 00:50:17,630
Aren't you gonna eat
the sandwich?

697
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:20,334
In a minute.

698
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:26,173
Take your time.

699
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:41,551
Is your game almost over?

700
00:50:41,595 --> 00:50:43,426
This is the bonus round.

701
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:55,304
I... I have

702
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:57,708
some cereal or a hot dog?

703
00:50:57,744 --> 00:50:59,439
No thank you.

704
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:06,519
Dr. Maplewood?

705
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:07,850
Yeah.

706
00:51:07,888 --> 00:51:10,413
Would it be all right
if I ate this tomorrow?

707
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:14,260
Well... sure but...

708
00:51:18,298 --> 00:51:21,096
I don't know if it's gonna
taste any good tomorrow.

709
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,711
How is it?

710
00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:38,684
Actually, it's really good.

712
00:51:50,998 --> 00:51:53,330
- Oh, honey, I feel so good.
- Me, too.

713
00:51:55,669 --> 00:51:58,160
I don't think I've slept
this well in so long.

714
00:51:58,205 --> 00:52:00,332
Me neither.

715
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:06,602
It's weird, I feel as if we...

716
00:52:09,516 --> 00:52:11,746
Bill, did we?

717
00:52:12,786 --> 00:52:14,549
Did you...?

718
00:52:15,789 --> 00:52:17,984
Did I?

719
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:19,424
Yes.

720
00:52:22,596 --> 00:52:24,530
I don't remember.

721
00:52:27,868 --> 00:52:30,063
That's all right.
It doesn't matter.

722
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:32,128
It matters.

723
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:33,503
Forget about it.

724
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:41,909
Okay.

725
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:47,715
It's funny, I remember
I was dreaming.

726
00:52:48,555 --> 00:52:50,716
And you were there...

727
00:52:50,757 --> 00:52:53,851
and Billy and Timmy
and Chloe...

728
00:52:53,894 --> 00:52:57,022
and Johnny Grasso.

729
00:52:57,064 --> 00:52:58,725
Hmm?

730
00:52:58,765 --> 00:53:01,325
I can't really remember
anything more.

731
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:04,166
Except...

732
00:53:07,274 --> 00:53:09,606
I don't know.

733
00:53:09,643 --> 00:53:12,009
Hmm?

734
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:14,343
Bill, please don't get
mad at me...

735
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:16,212
I know you hate
it when I ask...

736
00:53:18,018 --> 00:53:20,509
Do you still...?

738
00:53:28,362 --> 00:53:30,421
Yes.

739
00:53:35,235 --> 00:53:38,602
- Very, very much.
- Oh, Bill.

740
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:43,939
I do too. I do too.

741
00:53:43,977 --> 00:53:46,309
Sorry I need to keep
being reminded.

742
00:53:46,346 --> 00:53:49,076
- It's just...
- I know.

743
00:53:50,217 --> 00:53:51,684
We haven't been...

744
00:53:51,718 --> 00:53:53,583
I know.

745
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,520
- I know. It's my fault.
- No, honey.

746
00:53:55,555 --> 00:53:57,386
- It's my fault.
- No, I...

747
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,559
I know. I know.

748
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,865
Die! Die! Die!

749
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:10,697
Timmy, stop that.

750
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:12,500
Where's Billy?

751
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:14,905
Watching TV.

752
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:17,034
How come you two aren't
playing together?

753
00:54:18,145 --> 00:54:22,707
I don't know.
Billy said he didn't feel like it.

754
00:54:22,749 --> 00:54:25,013
Hmm?

755
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:28,586
Dr. Maplewood?

756
00:54:28,622 --> 00:54:31,056
Yes?

757
00:54:31,091 --> 00:54:33,525
Can you drive me home now?

758
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:38,762
Well, sure, but...

759
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,562
...aren't you having
a good time?

760
00:54:42,102 --> 00:54:45,094
I'm not feeling very well.

761
00:54:46,873 --> 00:54:48,465
What's the matter?

762
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:50,100
l, I don't know.

763
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:52,976
I... 

764
00:54:57,451 --> 00:54:59,009
Oh...

765
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,851
All right.

766
00:55:01,888 --> 00:55:03,253
Um...

767
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:06,853
I'll take you home.

768
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:10,456
Dr. Maplewood?

769
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:12,761
Yes, Johnny?

770
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,359
I'm sorry I threw up.

771
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:19,599
Don't worry about it.

772
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:22,164
'Cause I really had
a good time.

773
00:55:23,343 --> 00:55:24,901
Good.

774
00:55:26,847 --> 00:55:28,405
Billy did too.

775
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:33,652
We all did.

776
00:55:39,759 --> 00:55:42,125
Dr. Maplewood?

777
00:55:42,162 --> 00:55:43,322
Yes, Johnny?

778
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:47,931
You're so cool.

779
00:55:58,178 --> 00:56:00,271
Dad?

780
00:56:00,313 --> 00:56:02,247
Yes, Billy.

781
00:56:02,282 --> 00:56:04,910
I was kind of wondering...

783
00:56:07,721 --> 00:56:10,451
Yeah...?

784
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:11,718
Nothing.

785
00:56:18,532 --> 00:56:21,000
Did you have fun with Johnny?

786
00:56:23,036 --> 00:56:24,230
Yeah...

787
00:56:24,271 --> 00:56:27,832
It was okay.
He's a little girlish, though.

788
00:56:27,874 --> 00:56:29,603
Oh... yes.

789
00:56:56,536 --> 00:56:57,969
Dad?

790
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:02,766
Do you know how many
inches your penis is?

791
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:08,472
I never measured.

792
00:57:08,515 --> 00:57:09,743
'Cause...

793
00:57:11,952 --> 00:57:14,978
Ronald Farber says his penis
is eleven inches long.

794
00:57:15,021 --> 00:57:17,717
Do you think that's possible?

795
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:20,351
What Ronald Farber
doesn't know,

796
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:23,328
is that it's not length
that matters.

797
00:57:23,363 --> 00:57:25,126
It's width.

798
00:57:28,201 --> 00:57:30,761
Why?

799
00:57:30,804 --> 00:57:34,672
Things get a little more...
intense.

800
00:57:38,979 --> 00:57:41,106
What do you mean "intense?"

801
00:57:44,551 --> 00:57:48,988
Have you been practicing?

802
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,355
Yeah. But...

803
00:57:52,392 --> 00:57:54,451
it's no use.
Nothing comes.

804
00:57:57,063 --> 00:57:59,031
You have to be patient.

805
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:01,760
Your friend Ronald Farber,

806
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:04,827
I can assure you,
is full of crap.

807
00:58:08,074 --> 00:58:11,271
Yeah. I bet yours
is a lot wider.

808
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:12,835
And longer.

809
00:58:19,586 --> 00:58:21,554
Do you want me to measure?

810
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:22,816
Nah, that's okay.

811
00:58:34,534 --> 00:58:36,195
Hi. Ann Chambue.

812
00:58:36,236 --> 00:58:39,000
- Mona Jordan.
- Wonderful. Come this way.

813
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:39,971
Okay.

814
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:41,871
I'm sorry to have kept
you waiting so long.

815
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:44,740
Can I get you some
coffee or tea?

816
00:58:44,778 --> 00:58:46,643
No, thanks.

817
00:58:48,014 --> 00:58:49,481
Okay.

818
00:58:49,516 --> 00:58:52,747
Now then, how can I help you?

819
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:55,778
Oh, you said that there
might be something available

820
00:58:55,822 --> 00:58:57,813
over in Elysian Fields?

821
00:58:57,857 --> 00:59:00,417
Well, actually we have several
places we can see there.

822
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,724
First I need to get a bit
of information from you.

823
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:05,094
Are you looking for
a one, two or three bedroom?

824
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:08,329
- Three.
- Wonderful.

826
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:10,901
Is this for you
and your husband?

827
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:14,769
No.

828
00:59:14,808 --> 00:59:16,742
Just yourself then?

829
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:18,107
Yes.

830
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:20,942
No children?

831
00:59:22,115 --> 00:59:25,380
My children are grown.

832
00:59:25,418 --> 00:59:27,409
No pets?

833
00:59:28,321 --> 00:59:30,414
No.

834
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:33,551
Then just you alone
all by yourself?

836
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:55,174
Mrs. Jordan, is something
the matter?

837
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:05,217
My husband is leaving me.

838
01:00:05,258 --> 01:00:08,250
I'm so sorry.

839
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:12,295
You know...

840
01:00:12,332 --> 01:00:14,960
we have a lot of divorcees
in Phase IV.

841
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:16,559
Would you like to see
something there?

842
01:00:16,603 --> 01:00:19,299
Perhaps a bit smaller?

843
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,731
Who said I was getting divorced?

844
01:00:25,578 --> 01:00:27,944
What you need is a fresh start.

845
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:30,711
Yes. That's what I'm looking for.

846
01:00:36,322 --> 01:00:38,790
You know, I'm a divorcee.

847
01:00:38,825 --> 01:00:40,622
- Oh.
- And I live in Phase IV.

848
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:44,118
Oh. I'm so sorry.

849
01:00:44,164 --> 01:00:45,927
- Mrs. Jordan...
- Mona.

850
01:00:45,965 --> 01:00:48,126
Mona. That's a beautiful name.

851
01:00:48,168 --> 01:00:49,260
Thank you.

852
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,863
How long were you married?

853
01:00:52,906 --> 01:00:54,100
Forty years.

854
01:00:56,776 --> 01:00:58,141
You know, Mona, I ah...

855
01:00:58,178 --> 01:01:00,442
I think we have
a lot in common.

856
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,506
Probably more than you realize.

857
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,711
See, I know what you're
going through, I've been there.

858
01:01:06,953 --> 01:01:09,683
I'd like to share a little
secret with you.

859
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:12,657
Divorce was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

860
01:01:14,294 --> 01:01:16,387
Really.

861
01:01:24,938 --> 01:01:27,168
Don't worry, she's the
exception to the rule.

862
01:01:27,207 --> 01:01:29,471
Everyone here is
much more youthful.

864
01:02:08,248 --> 01:02:10,375
Are you sure?

865
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,441
Let me show you something.

866
01:02:12,485 --> 01:02:14,248
You see this?

867
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:18,450
You're the picture of health.

868
01:02:18,491 --> 01:02:20,015
No tumors?

869
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,258
- Nope.
- How's the heart?

870
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:24,820
Like an ox, Lenny.

871
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,559
You'll live to be a hundred.

872
01:02:28,868 --> 01:02:31,462
So I still have another
thirty-five years?

873
01:02:31,504 --> 01:02:34,268
Just stay off the salt.

874
01:02:34,307 --> 01:02:36,104
You bet.

875
01:02:52,158 --> 01:02:53,591
Hi, Lenny.

876
01:02:56,062 --> 01:02:57,791
Oh.

877
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,525
Hello, Diane.

878
01:02:59,565 --> 01:03:01,533
Mind if I join you?

879
01:03:01,567 --> 01:03:03,034
No.

880
01:03:12,278 --> 01:03:13,438
No thanks.

881
01:03:15,214 --> 01:03:16,647
How's Mona?

882
01:03:17,717 --> 01:03:19,207
She's fine.

883
01:03:19,252 --> 01:03:22,119
Why's she inside on such
a beautiful day?

884
01:03:22,155 --> 01:03:23,520
I don't know.

885
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:26,918
What do you mean,
you don't know?

886
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,225
- I don't know.
- Whatever.

887
01:03:30,263 --> 01:03:32,254
How are your girls?

888
01:03:32,298 --> 01:03:34,596
Fine, I guess.

889
01:03:34,634 --> 01:03:37,000
The grandchildren coming
to visit soon?

890
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:38,936
I don't know.

891
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:44,971
Look, Lenny...

892
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:48,037
I think you ought to know,
I heard about you and Mona.

893
01:03:48,081 --> 01:03:49,571
About what?

894
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:52,482
That you're getting divorced.

895
01:03:52,518 --> 01:03:56,079
- I really sorry.
- We're not getting divorced.

896
01:03:56,122 --> 01:03:58,420
Divorced, separated, whatever.

897
01:03:58,458 --> 01:04:00,358
It doesn't matter.

898
01:04:00,393 --> 01:04:02,293
You're alone now.

899
01:04:08,935 --> 01:04:11,904
Anyway...

900
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:14,736
if you ever need anyone
to talk to...

901
01:04:14,774 --> 01:04:16,241
you know where to find me.

903
01:04:56,783 --> 01:04:59,115
Everything I write is so shallow...

904
01:04:59,152 --> 01:05:00,585
so superficial.

905
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,088
Can't anyone see through
my work?

906
01:05:03,122 --> 01:05:05,920
It's inherent phoniness.
Rape at 11...

907
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,118
Rape at 12...

908
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,889
What the hell do I know
about rape?

909
01:05:08,928 --> 01:05:10,623
I've never been raped.

910
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:14,394
I'm just another sordid
exploitationist.

911
01:05:14,434 --> 01:05:17,369
If only I'd been raped
as a child.

912
01:05:17,403 --> 01:05:19,803
Then I would know authenticity.

913
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,932
But instead...

915
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:29,880
I'm no good.

916
01:05:29,916 --> 01:05:31,349
No good.

917
01:05:31,384 --> 01:05:34,251
Nothing. Nothing.

918
01:05:34,287 --> 01:05:36,983
Zero. Zero.

920
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:50,658
Hello?

921
01:05:50,703 --> 01:05:52,603
I know who you are
and you are nothing.

922
01:05:52,638 --> 01:05:54,162
You think you
are fucking something,

923
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:55,697
but you are fucking nothing.

924
01:05:55,741 --> 01:05:58,938
You are empty. You are a zero.
You are a black hole,

925
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:02,277
I'm gonna fuck you so bad
you'll be coming out of your ears.

928
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:24,900
- Data Resources.
- Who are you?

931
01:06:40,486 --> 01:06:44,513
- What do you want?
- I want you to fuck me.

932
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:46,718
I... uh...

933
01:06:49,162 --> 01:06:51,687
I don't think I can do that.

934
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:54,222
I mean...

935
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:56,394
I don't think I can do that.

936
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,003
I gotta go.

937
01:06:59,038 --> 01:07:00,733
- Call me tomorrow.
- All right.

938
01:07:00,773 --> 01:07:02,070
Hey, Allen...

939
01:07:02,108 --> 01:07:03,302
did you see the playoffs
last night?

940
01:07:03,342 --> 01:07:05,742
Yeah. pretty good.

941
01:07:05,778 --> 01:07:07,302
Pretty good.

942
01:07:07,346 --> 01:07:10,144
I was on my knees praying
for that shot.

943
01:07:10,183 --> 01:07:12,208
It worked.

946
01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:46,716
Who is it?

947
01:08:31,397 --> 01:08:33,160
Who is it?

948
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,861
It's uh... me.
Kristina.

949
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:44,633
Hey...

950
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:46,907
- How's it going?
- Okay.

951
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:50,643
Um, I have some more
information about Pedro.

952
01:08:51,584 --> 01:08:52,414
Pedro?

953
01:08:52,451 --> 01:08:54,612
- Yeah, you know, the um...
- Oh, yeah.

954
01:08:54,654 --> 01:08:56,246
What?

955
01:08:56,289 --> 01:08:57,620
Um, well...

956
01:08:57,657 --> 01:09:00,490
- Are you all right?
- No.

957
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:07,895
Pussy... Need pussy...

963
01:11:16,629 --> 01:11:18,460
What the fuck
are you doing here?

964
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:22,497
Get out.

965
01:11:23,869 --> 01:11:25,234
Get out!

966
01:11:25,271 --> 01:11:27,466
Get out!

969
01:11:48,461 --> 01:11:50,053
Joy!

970
01:11:51,464 --> 01:11:53,193
Joy!

971
01:11:53,799 --> 01:11:56,461
Joy! Joy!

972
01:11:56,902 --> 01:11:59,370
I am Vlad,
your student.

973
01:11:59,405 --> 01:12:01,396
Hello, Vlad.
How are you?

974
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,668
I am fine.
How are you?

975
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,767
Oh, fine. Fine.

976
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:06,505
I not believe you.

977
01:12:06,545 --> 01:12:09,070
Really, Vlad. I'm fine.

978
01:12:16,388 --> 01:12:19,448
I'm sorry... it's just
I'm a terrible teacher.

979
01:12:20,526 --> 01:12:23,984
Everyone hates me and I should
have never left telephone sales,

980
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:27,123
because I was really
doing a lot more good then.

981
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:29,327
Where you are go now?

982
01:12:29,368 --> 01:12:31,495
I'm just on my way home.

983
01:12:31,537 --> 01:12:33,630
Tell me where do you live.
I take you home.

984
01:12:33,672 --> 01:12:34,934
Oh no, I couldn't.

985
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:36,703
Joy.

986
01:12:36,742 --> 01:12:38,607
Come in my cab.

987
01:12:38,644 --> 01:12:41,306
- I give you ride.
- Vlad, no.

988
01:12:41,347 --> 01:12:42,974
I like walking
and the train is nearby.

989
01:12:43,015 --> 01:12:45,540
No. No train.
I drive you home.

990
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:47,313
I live in New Jersey.

991
01:12:47,353 --> 01:12:50,220
- Good. I take you New Jersey.
- No, maybe you don't understand.

992
01:12:50,256 --> 01:12:54,056
- New Jersey is far.
- Joy, you no understand.

993
01:12:54,093 --> 01:12:56,618
Huh? I driver.

994
01:12:56,662 --> 01:12:58,027
My taxi.

995
01:12:58,731 --> 01:13:01,859
You come. You understand?

996
01:13:01,901 --> 01:13:03,664
You come.

997
01:13:05,137 --> 01:13:06,104
Are you sure you know...?

998
01:13:06,138 --> 01:13:08,163
Vlad knows.

999
01:13:29,528 --> 01:13:30,961
I love New Jersey.

1000
01:13:35,501 --> 01:13:37,332
Don't you miss Russia?

1001
01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:41,431
Fuck the cunt of Russia.

1002
01:13:42,775 --> 01:13:45,243
Well, I guess it's best
to feel that way.

1003
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:10,101
Thank you for everything.

1004
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:12,797
That was really very
nice of you.

1005
01:14:12,838 --> 01:14:15,033
I'm sorry about before...

1006
01:14:15,074 --> 01:14:16,735
that was very unlike me.

1007
01:14:20,779 --> 01:14:23,270
Do you think you'll need help
finding your way back?

1008
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:33,248
Why you not married?

1009
01:14:33,292 --> 01:14:36,090
Oh... Vlad.

1010
01:14:36,128 --> 01:14:39,723
Our life is
so different in America.

1011
01:14:39,765 --> 01:14:43,599
Here a woman can, I know this
is difficult to understand, but,

1012
01:14:43,636 --> 01:14:47,663
a woman can fulfill
her potential.

1013
01:14:47,706 --> 01:14:49,037
Um...

1014
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:52,305
there are opportunities
to do something...

1015
01:14:52,344 --> 01:14:55,472
...do good, really improve
the world.

1016
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:57,072
Do you like men?

1017
01:14:59,151 --> 01:15:01,813
Yes.

1018
01:15:01,854 --> 01:15:03,344
But, it's not so simple.

1019
01:15:03,389 --> 01:15:05,186
Are you lesbian?

1020
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,988
- No.
- It's all right.

1021
01:15:08,027 --> 01:15:09,790
If you are lesbian.

1022
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:12,797
I like lesbian.

1023
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:14,860
Vlad...

1024
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,026
I'm sorry.

1025
01:15:16,068 --> 01:15:21,028
But, this conversation has
become a bit strange for me.

1026
01:15:21,073 --> 01:15:23,940
So thank you
for the ride, and...

1027
01:15:32,785 --> 01:15:35,015
Well, then, good night...

1028
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:36,578
and um...

1029
01:15:36,622 --> 01:15:38,089
I'll see you in...

1030
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:58,540
Would you like to come inside
for a cup of tea?

1031
01:16:13,726 --> 01:16:16,058
I'll go put the kettle on.

1032
01:16:32,344 --> 01:16:33,709
Oh, that's good...

1033
01:16:33,746 --> 01:16:36,874
Take your shoes off.
Make yourself comfortable.

1034
01:16:52,264 --> 01:16:53,959
It's my parents' place.

1035
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,534
I plan on
moving out soon, though.

1036
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:01,234
- How long you live here?
- Since I was born.

1037
01:17:01,273 --> 01:17:04,709
I find there are a lot of
advantages to not moving.

1038
01:17:06,111 --> 01:17:07,271
So...

1039
01:17:07,312 --> 01:17:09,303
What did you do in Russia?

1040
01:17:09,348 --> 01:17:11,908
- I was thief.
- Oh.

1041
01:17:13,886 --> 01:17:16,912
You mean the Mafia?

1042
01:17:16,955 --> 01:17:18,286
No.

1043
01:17:18,323 --> 01:17:21,656
Independent.
I steal things on my own.

1044
01:17:21,693 --> 01:17:24,719
Although I have many offers.

1045
01:17:24,763 --> 01:17:26,754
You are musician?

1046
01:17:26,799 --> 01:17:29,791
Oh, no.
I just write songs a little.

1047
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:32,832
What kind songs?

1048
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:34,964
I don't know.
They're so terrible.

1049
01:17:38,844 --> 01:17:41,005
Love songs.

1050
01:17:43,549 --> 01:17:45,517
- No.
- Play.

1051
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:47,382
Oh, no.

1052
01:17:48,921 --> 01:17:50,912
I play.

1053
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:01,465
So many nights

1054
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,628
I sit by my window

1055
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:07,696
waiting for someone

1056
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:10,708
to sing me her song

1057
01:18:10,742 --> 01:18:13,609
So many dreams

1058
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:16,978
I've kept deep inside me

1059
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:19,984
alone in the dark

1060
01:18:20,018 --> 01:18:24,011
but now you've come along

1061
01:18:24,056 --> 01:18:27,890
You light up my life

1062
01:18:27,926 --> 01:18:30,986
You give me hope

1063
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:34,556
to carry on

1064
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,330
You light up my days

1065
01:18:37,369 --> 01:18:41,465
and fill all my nights

1066
01:18:41,506 --> 01:18:45,101
with song

1067
01:18:45,143 --> 01:18:49,580
And you light up my life

1068
01:18:49,615 --> 01:18:52,675
You give me hope

1069
01:18:52,718 --> 01:18:55,687
to carry on

1070
01:18:55,721 --> 01:18:58,815
You light up my days

1071
01:18:58,857 --> 01:19:02,224
and fill my nights

1072
01:19:02,261 --> 01:19:05,424
with song

1073
01:19:05,464 --> 01:19:08,024
It can't be wrong

1074
01:19:08,066 --> 01:19:13,003
when it feels so right

1075
01:19:13,038 --> 01:19:15,302
'cause you...

1076
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:19,106
you light up my life.

1077
01:19:23,849 --> 01:19:25,407
Okay.

1078
01:19:26,919 --> 01:19:28,887
Okay.

1079
01:19:30,789 --> 01:19:32,916
I have to go now.

1080
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:53,573
See you in class tomorrow.

1082
01:20:19,237 --> 01:20:20,795
Good morning.

1083
01:20:52,804 --> 01:20:54,169
So, how's it going?

1084
01:20:54,206 --> 01:20:56,140
Oh, hi, Rhonda.

1085
01:20:56,174 --> 01:20:58,540
Your students treating you okay?

1086
01:20:58,577 --> 01:21:01,068
Oh, they're just great.

1087
01:21:01,113 --> 01:21:02,546
I hate to say this, but,

1088
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:05,516
I told you so.

1089
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:08,417
How about you?
How's your class?

1090
01:21:08,453 --> 01:21:10,444
Oh, my students
are such a hoot.

1091
01:21:10,489 --> 01:21:13,617
They're always telling
me how much they love me.

1092
01:21:16,228 --> 01:21:19,061
Actually, if you can keep
a secret,

1093
01:21:19,097 --> 01:21:21,327
there's this one...

1094
01:21:21,366 --> 01:21:23,857
Igor...

1095
01:21:23,902 --> 01:21:25,995
I've got such a crush on him.

1096
01:21:26,038 --> 01:21:27,562
Oh?

1097
01:21:27,606 --> 01:21:30,166
Well, not that I'd ever...

1098
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:32,039
I mean, especially the
Russians.

1099
01:21:32,077 --> 01:21:33,669
What?

1100
01:21:36,048 --> 01:21:38,278
- B.O.
- Really?

1101
01:21:38,316 --> 01:21:40,614
- Mine seem okay.
- You're very lucky.

1102
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:46,623
- Rhonda?
- Yeah?

1103
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:49,320
If your Igor...

1104
01:21:49,361 --> 01:21:50,919
used deodorant...

1105
01:21:50,962 --> 01:21:52,953
You teacher Vlad?

1106
01:21:52,998 --> 01:21:55,489
Yes.

1108
01:22:07,913 --> 01:22:10,279
Oh, my God.
That woman was crazy.

1109
01:22:10,315 --> 01:22:12,545
Joy, are you okay?

1110
01:22:13,685 --> 01:22:16,483
Yeah. I'm fine.

1112
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:26,264
Joy...

1113
01:22:27,732 --> 01:22:29,165
you didn't...

1114
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:31,863
did you?

1115
01:22:50,155 --> 01:22:53,318
- Mom?
- Yeah?

1116
01:22:53,358 --> 01:22:56,259
There's blood in my BM.

1117
01:22:56,294 --> 01:22:58,819
Can I stay home
from school today?

1118
01:23:00,298 --> 01:23:03,734
- How do you feel?
- Okay.

1119
01:23:03,768 --> 01:23:05,167
Are you sure?

1120
01:23:05,203 --> 01:23:07,933
Yeah. I feel fine.

1121
01:23:07,973 --> 01:23:10,373
Maybe a little sore.
But...

1122
01:23:10,408 --> 01:23:12,308
I'm ready to go back to school.

1123
01:23:12,344 --> 01:23:14,039
That's good, Johnny.

1124
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:16,411
Johnny, I have to ask you
a few questions. Is that okay?

1125
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,439
Yeah.

1126
01:23:18,483 --> 01:23:20,508
When did you first
start feeling sick?

1127
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:23,681
Yesterday.

1128
01:23:23,722 --> 01:23:25,417
What happened?

1129
01:23:25,457 --> 01:23:28,051
I threw up at my friend's house.

1130
01:23:28,093 --> 01:23:31,119
Johnny... he spent
the night there.

1131
01:23:31,163 --> 01:23:34,792
I thought that he had
a little virus.

1132
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:37,301
Did you eat anything unusual,
Johnny?

1133
01:23:38,737 --> 01:23:40,500
Just a tuna sandwich.

1134
01:23:40,539 --> 01:23:43,133
He loves tuna salad.

1135
01:23:43,175 --> 01:23:45,939
I see.

1136
01:23:45,977 --> 01:23:49,708
Johnny, when did you
first notice the blood?

1137
01:23:49,748 --> 01:23:52,376
When I went to the bathroom
this morning.

1138
01:23:54,486 --> 01:23:56,317
Johnny, I have to ask you
a question

1139
01:23:56,354 --> 01:23:59,517
and it's very important that
you be honest, okay?

1140
01:23:59,558 --> 01:24:00,752
Uh-huh.

1141
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:04,694
Johnny was there,
in the last day or two...

1142
01:24:04,729 --> 01:24:08,665
someone who hurt you?

1143
01:24:09,201 --> 01:24:11,635
No. I...

1144
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:13,501
I don't think so.

1145
01:24:13,538 --> 01:24:16,132
But someone did hurt you?
No, Johnny?

1146
01:24:16,174 --> 01:24:18,039
No. No one hurt me.

1147
01:24:18,076 --> 01:24:21,307
What do you mean, no?
You've been fucking raped.

1148
01:24:23,982 --> 01:24:25,506
I'm sorry.

1149
01:24:30,155 --> 01:24:32,123
More potatoes, Bill?

1150
01:24:32,157 --> 01:24:33,818
Mmm. No thanks.

1151
01:24:33,858 --> 01:24:35,917
I got plenty.

1152
01:24:37,028 --> 01:24:38,893
The baby-sitter should be here
any minute now.

1153
01:24:39,464 --> 01:24:41,728
When does the PTA start?

1154
01:24:41,766 --> 01:24:43,700
We've still got about
a half an hour.

1155
01:24:46,504 --> 01:24:48,768
So, how did school go today?

1156
01:24:48,807 --> 01:24:50,832
Okay.

1157
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:52,274
Was Johnny there?

1158
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,971
No.

1159
01:24:54,012 --> 01:24:57,209
Oh, I sure hope the kids don't
catch whatever he's got.

1161
01:25:03,555 --> 01:25:05,147
Very funny, Timmy.

1162
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,351
Now you're excused
and can go right to bed.

1163
01:25:07,392 --> 01:25:09,360
- But, mom.
- Yep.

1164
01:25:09,394 --> 01:25:10,861
Excuse me, Bill.

1166
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:16,033
Hello?

1167
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:18,729
Hi, Tawny, is there a problem?

1169
01:25:21,673 --> 01:25:25,131
Well, thank you for giving me
so much notice.

1170
01:25:25,176 --> 01:25:26,700
Well...

1171
01:25:26,745 --> 01:25:28,269
Uh-huh...

1172
01:25:28,313 --> 01:25:30,543
Yeah, sure, I'm sorry too.

1173
01:25:30,582 --> 01:25:34,143
Well maybe you could have
thought of that before.

1174
01:25:34,185 --> 01:25:35,049
Bye-bye.

1175
01:25:37,322 --> 01:25:39,847
Bill, I'm sorry you're going to
have to go by yourself tonight.

1176
01:25:39,891 --> 01:25:42,018
Isn't there someone else
you can get?

1177
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,153
No, not at this late hour.

1179
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:47,488
Come on. You're gonna come with
me right now and take a bath.

1180
01:25:47,532 --> 01:25:50,524
- But I'm not finished.
- Yes, you're finished.

1181
01:25:50,568 --> 01:25:51,796
- Let's go.
- Wait.

1182
01:25:51,836 --> 01:25:54,430
My Tamagotchi.

1183
01:25:54,472 --> 01:25:55,461
Get your Tamagotchi
and let's go.

1184
01:25:55,507 --> 01:25:58,032
Come on, mister, up the stairs.
Come on.

1185
01:25:58,076 --> 01:25:59,805
Timmy, please.
Come on.

1186
01:26:07,385 --> 01:26:08,875
Dad?

1187
01:26:10,455 --> 01:26:12,946
If you and mom died
in a plane crash,

1188
01:26:12,991 --> 01:26:15,755
would it be all right
if I took over?

1189
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:22,859
Well... probably one of your
aunts would want to help out.

1190
01:26:22,901 --> 01:26:27,065
So, you don't think I'm old
enough to take care of myself,

1191
01:26:27,105 --> 01:26:29,096
Timmy and Clioe.

1192
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,300
Well...

1193
01:26:30,342 --> 01:26:31,866
No.

1194
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:35,073
Ronald Farber's parents are away
in Europe for a few days,

1195
01:26:35,113 --> 01:26:39,846
and Ronald gets to stay home by
himself without a baby-sitter.

1196
01:26:39,884 --> 01:26:41,818
So why do I need a baby-sitter?

1197
01:26:41,853 --> 01:26:45,414
Well, if you want to change
Clioe's diapers...

1198
01:26:45,457 --> 01:26:49,894
Well, if I didn't have any
little brother or sister,

1199
01:26:49,928 --> 01:26:53,659
would you let me stay alone
by myself for a few days?

1200
01:26:56,034 --> 01:26:58,935
Your mom and I are not
Mr. and Mrs. Farber.

1201
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,904
We worry.

1202
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:02,531
No.

1203
01:27:02,574 --> 01:27:05,008
What if I were twelve?

1204
01:27:05,043 --> 01:27:07,136
No.

1205
01:27:07,178 --> 01:27:08,770
Thirteen?

1206
01:27:14,886 --> 01:27:18,322
At thirteen I think
you'll be okay.

1207
01:27:18,356 --> 01:27:20,722
Can you promise?

1208
01:27:26,731 --> 01:27:30,223
As long as you don't look like
you're eleven.

1209
01:27:30,268 --> 01:27:31,758
I won't.

1210
01:27:33,104 --> 01:27:34,901
Okay.

1211
01:27:34,939 --> 01:27:36,099
Thirteen then.

1212
01:27:39,978 --> 01:27:42,446
Hello, in Roseland, please.

1213
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,381
I'm looking for the address
of a resident.

1214
01:27:45,417 --> 01:27:46,850
The name is Farber.

1215
01:27:50,655 --> 01:27:53,180
11 Angel Court?

1216
01:27:53,224 --> 01:27:54,384
Thank you.

1217
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:35,499
- Hon, is that you?
- Yes.

1218
01:28:38,903 --> 01:28:41,838
Did you remember the milk?

1219
01:28:41,873 --> 01:28:43,932
Yeah.

1221
01:28:54,118 --> 01:28:55,676
How was the meeting?

1222
01:28:56,955 --> 01:28:59,048
Fine.

1223
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:03,116
Bill, are you all right?

1224
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:08,194
I think I have to lie down.

1225
01:29:08,233 --> 01:29:10,030
Oh, shit.

1226
01:29:10,068 --> 01:29:13,128
I hope you're not coming down
with what Johnny Grasso had.

1227
01:29:16,841 --> 01:29:19,105
I don't think so.

1228
01:29:19,143 --> 01:29:20,576
I'll be up in a minute.

1229
01:29:59,918 --> 01:30:01,977
Dad?

1230
01:30:03,555 --> 01:30:05,523
Yeah?

1231
01:30:07,492 --> 01:30:09,687
I...

1232
01:30:09,727 --> 01:30:12,423
I almost came.

1233
01:30:26,311 --> 01:30:28,802
Trish?

1234
01:30:37,555 --> 01:30:38,522
Trish?

1236
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:50,460
Do you love me?

1237
01:30:50,501 --> 01:30:52,799
Oh, Bill.

1238
01:30:52,837 --> 01:30:54,737
- Yes.
- No, I mean...

1239
01:30:57,976 --> 01:30:59,409
...do you really love me?

1240
01:30:59,444 --> 01:31:02,311
No matter what?

1241
01:31:02,981 --> 01:31:05,176
No matter what.

1242
01:31:05,216 --> 01:31:07,309
Why?

1243
01:31:11,422 --> 01:31:13,447
No matter...

1244
01:31:15,893 --> 01:31:17,224
...whatever.

1245
01:31:20,765 --> 01:31:24,428
Bill, you have me.

1246
01:31:24,469 --> 01:31:26,960
You always will.

1247
01:31:47,392 --> 01:31:49,792
I'm sick.

1248
01:31:49,827 --> 01:31:53,126
Aww, honey.

1249
01:31:54,365 --> 01:31:56,492
Take some Tylenol.

1250
01:31:56,534 --> 01:31:58,798
You'll feel better tomorrow.

1251
01:32:15,586 --> 01:32:18,555
I met with Steven Zimmer
this morning.

1252
01:32:18,589 --> 01:32:21,023
- You like him?
- Yeah.

1253
01:32:21,059 --> 01:32:22,390
I'm gonna use him.

1254
01:32:22,427 --> 01:32:27,160
Good.
I'm gonna use Marty Blua.

1255
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:29,826
Good.

1256
01:32:29,867 --> 01:32:31,562
I feel so much better now.

1257
01:32:31,602 --> 01:32:35,163
Well good.
It shouldn't take long.

1258
01:32:42,547 --> 01:32:44,037
Good night.

1259
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:59,991
- Lenny?
- Yeah?

1260
01:33:00,031 --> 01:33:03,398
Can you sleep on the living
room couch?

1261
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:08,403
Why?

1262
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:11,602
Steven Zimmer thought
it would be a good idea.

1263
01:33:13,478 --> 01:33:15,378
Okay.

1264
01:33:29,894 --> 01:33:33,057
- Gin and tonic?
- Okay. Thanks.

1265
01:33:34,098 --> 01:33:36,123
God, it's so bright outside,

1266
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:38,931
it gives me a headache just
looking out the window.

1267
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:42,201
Yeah, well they say
it's gonna rain tomorrow.

1268
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,073
I don't want to talk about
the fucking weather.

1269
01:33:45,109 --> 01:33:47,543
Well it's good
for playing golf.

1270
01:33:47,578 --> 01:33:50,308
I hate that game.
It's so boring.

1271
01:33:50,348 --> 01:33:52,942
It passes the time.

1272
01:33:52,984 --> 01:33:54,918
I like to travel.

1273
01:33:56,354 --> 01:33:58,584
I went to Europe once.

1274
01:33:58,623 --> 01:34:01,387
Have you ever been to Tahiti?

1275
01:34:01,425 --> 01:34:03,586
No.

1276
01:34:03,628 --> 01:34:06,256
How about Tunisia?

1277
01:34:06,297 --> 01:34:09,391
- A night in Tunisia?
- No.

1278
01:34:13,237 --> 01:34:15,671
Vincent never liked to travel.

1279
01:34:16,674 --> 01:34:18,301
I guess I'm like Vincent.

1280
01:34:25,883 --> 01:34:29,478
When I was a child I always
imagined that...

1281
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,648
I'd marry the man
I fell in love with,

1282
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:35,352
have a son and a daughter
who loved me

1283
01:34:35,393 --> 01:34:38,294
as much as I hated my mother,

1284
01:34:38,329 --> 01:34:40,320
then die...

1285
01:34:40,364 --> 01:34:44,960
tragically and suddenly.
Young and beautiful.

1286
01:34:47,004 --> 01:34:52,067
When Vincent left me
I imagined I'd finally be happy.

1287
01:34:53,344 --> 01:34:56,074
I guess you haven't lost
your imagination.

1288
01:34:59,851 --> 01:35:01,910
Lenny, I've got to get
out of here.

1289
01:35:01,953 --> 01:35:03,580
I can't breathe.

1290
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:06,590
The women are pathetic gossips
and the men are...

1291
01:35:06,624 --> 01:35:08,558
Just pathetic.

1292
01:35:10,595 --> 01:35:13,359
I don't want to die here.

1293
01:35:14,298 --> 01:35:16,664
You just don't want to die.

1294
01:35:18,169 --> 01:35:19,932
Not alone.

1295
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:48,090
Don't...

1296
01:36:48,459 --> 01:36:50,654
Don't feel guilty.

1297
01:36:50,695 --> 01:36:52,822
I don't.

1298
01:36:53,898 --> 01:36:55,559
I don't feel anything.

1300
01:37:43,347 --> 01:37:44,871
I have to see you.

1302
01:37:53,491 --> 01:37:55,857
Who is it?

1303
01:37:55,893 --> 01:37:57,292
Kristina.

1304
01:38:04,001 --> 01:38:06,162
I'm sorry about last night.

1305
01:38:08,339 --> 01:38:11,274
Yeah. Uh, me, too.

1306
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:12,332
I shouldn't have...

1307
01:38:12,376 --> 01:38:14,469
I understand.

1308
01:38:14,512 --> 01:38:16,912
I mean-- See, I can...

1309
01:38:16,947 --> 01:38:19,575
I can admit it.
That I'm fat...

1310
01:38:19,617 --> 01:38:21,710
and I'm ugly.

1311
01:38:21,752 --> 01:38:23,845
- No, no.
- Yes.

1312
01:38:23,888 --> 01:38:26,015
Yes.

1313
01:38:38,736 --> 01:38:40,169
Thank you.

1314
01:38:43,841 --> 01:38:45,138
Say...

1315
01:38:46,544 --> 01:38:48,569
you wanna go somewhere?

1317
01:40:12,029 --> 01:40:14,497
I like you.

1318
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:21,629
I have a confession to make.

1319
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:24,835
What?

1320
01:40:27,578 --> 01:40:29,637
Do you remember Pedro's penis?

1321
01:40:34,084 --> 01:40:35,949
You mean the one that...

1322
01:40:35,986 --> 01:40:37,851
that was...

1323
01:40:37,888 --> 01:40:39,856
cut off?

1324
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:45,595
Well, it wasn't really cut off.

1325
01:40:48,299 --> 01:40:49,698
What happened to it?

1326
01:40:49,733 --> 01:40:51,496
Nothing.

1327
01:40:53,637 --> 01:40:55,764
I uh...

1328
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:58,838
I don't understand.

1329
01:40:58,876 --> 01:41:01,208
Um...

1330
01:41:01,245 --> 01:41:04,009
why would you make something
like that up?

1331
01:41:05,015 --> 01:41:07,006
Was Pedro even killed?

1332
01:41:11,388 --> 01:41:13,288
How do you--
how do you know?

1333
01:41:16,627 --> 01:41:19,460
I tried so many times
to tell you,

1334
01:41:19,496 --> 01:41:21,726
but it's hard to, um...

1335
01:41:26,103 --> 01:41:27,968
I'd always been
very friendly to him.

1336
01:41:28,005 --> 01:41:30,701
I try to be that way
with all the doormen,

1337
01:41:30,741 --> 01:41:33,505
even thought they're usually
snickering behind my back.

1338
01:41:33,544 --> 01:41:35,478
I don't care.
I'm still friendly.

1339
01:41:35,512 --> 01:41:37,946
It's just my way.

1340
01:41:37,982 --> 01:41:40,007
But, um...

1341
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:43,144
Pedro was different.
Pedro never snickered.

1342
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:44,882
Of course, who was he
to snicker?

1343
01:41:44,922 --> 01:41:47,220
He wasn't exactly Tom Cruise.

1344
01:41:48,692 --> 01:41:50,853
Still, he could have,

1345
01:41:50,894 --> 01:41:52,327
but he didn't.

1346
01:41:54,565 --> 01:41:56,760
So anyway, one night...

1347
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:01,237
I was coming home from the
24-hour Pathmark, it was late.

1348
01:42:04,341 --> 01:42:05,433
Good evening, Miss Hope.

1349
01:42:05,476 --> 01:42:07,740
Hi, Pedro. Can you help me
with these bags?

1350
01:42:07,778 --> 01:42:10,747
No problem.

1351
01:42:10,781 --> 01:42:12,248
Thank you.

1352
01:42:12,283 --> 01:42:14,342
Normally I don't need any help,

1353
01:42:14,385 --> 01:42:16,683
but my back hurt because
the bags were heavy.

1354
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,415
And I had...

1355
01:42:18,455 --> 01:42:20,286
a half-gallon of strawberry
ice cream...

1356
01:42:20,324 --> 01:42:22,758
two boxes of fudge
and a key lime pie.

1357
01:42:22,793 --> 01:42:25,387
And uh, I just couldn't wait
to get home

1358
01:42:25,429 --> 01:42:27,989
and get under the covers
and watch TV.

1359
01:42:30,768 --> 01:42:32,565
But, um...

1360
01:42:32,603 --> 01:42:35,629
I was in the elevator when
I first got this funny feeling,

1361
01:42:35,673 --> 01:42:37,538
like he was...

1362
01:42:37,574 --> 01:42:39,599
you know, kind of looking
at me funny.

1363
01:42:39,643 --> 01:42:42,908
And I thought maybe he was
just being friendly too.

1364
01:42:44,415 --> 01:42:46,508
I mean, you know,

1365
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:48,882
just um, two friendly people.

1366
01:43:02,733 --> 01:43:04,826
Um, would you mind putting
those in the kitchen for me?

1367
01:43:04,868 --> 01:43:06,768
No problem.

1368
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,086
Thanks so much, Pedro.

1369
01:43:25,122 --> 01:43:26,589
No problem.

1370
01:43:31,428 --> 01:43:33,896
Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

1371
01:43:35,799 --> 01:43:37,289
Forget about that.

1372
01:43:41,438 --> 01:43:42,803
What I'd really like is...

1373
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,536
a scoop of your ice cream
before I go back down.

1374
01:43:52,883 --> 01:43:55,374
Oh sure... please have a seat.

1375
01:44:16,974 --> 01:44:19,465
My wife died three years ago.

1376
01:44:20,878 --> 01:44:22,937
I feel...

1377
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:25,642
...so lonely.

1378
01:44:30,954 --> 01:44:33,821
You are a beautiful woman,
Kristina.

1379
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:39,085
You are so beautiful, Kristina.

1382
01:44:56,847 --> 01:44:59,008
And the next thing I know...

1383
01:45:00,851 --> 01:45:02,648
...he's inside me,

1384
01:45:02,686 --> 01:45:04,813
you know, just pounding away.

1385
01:45:04,855 --> 01:45:07,449
Oh, Allen.

1386
01:45:08,659 --> 01:45:11,219
- All finished?
- Yeah.

1387
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:14,725
Would you like to see
a dessert menu?

1388
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,967
What kind of ice cream
do you have?

1389
01:45:19,002 --> 01:45:21,562
Chocolate, vanilla
and strawberry.

1390
01:45:21,605 --> 01:45:22,503
Umm...

1391
01:45:22,539 --> 01:45:25,133
Okay then, I'll have a plain
chocolate fudge sundae

1392
01:45:25,175 --> 01:45:27,143
with strawberry ice cream.
Thank you.

1393
01:45:27,177 --> 01:45:28,974
And you, sir?

1394
01:45:29,012 --> 01:45:31,071
Just the check, please.

1395
01:45:35,719 --> 01:45:38,210
So anyway, everything got
really quiet,

1396
01:45:38,255 --> 01:45:40,553
and then I thought, well okay,

1397
01:45:40,591 --> 01:45:42,388
at least the worst part is over.

1399
01:45:57,941 --> 01:46:00,102
How do you like it?

1400
01:46:03,013 --> 01:46:05,709
Kiss me again.

1401
01:46:09,052 --> 01:46:10,280
But, that was just an act.

1402
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:13,016
I let him kiss me one last time,

1403
01:46:13,056 --> 01:46:14,921
and I grabbed ahold
of his neck,

1404
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:16,425
and I twisted it...

1405
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,018
...backward.

1406
01:46:20,664 --> 01:46:22,564
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1407
01:46:30,007 --> 01:46:31,770
And then I had to
cut up his body.

1408
01:46:35,546 --> 01:46:37,275
You know, plastic bag,
all the parts.

1409
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:42,808
I've been throwing it out
gradually ever since.

1410
01:46:45,455 --> 01:46:47,685
There's still some left
in my freezer.

1411
01:46:48,592 --> 01:46:51,186
- So you did cut off his...
- No.

1412
01:46:51,228 --> 01:46:53,492
I left it attached,
I didn't want to touch it again.

1414
01:47:03,674 --> 01:47:05,801
I feel so terrible.

1415
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:09,735
You must think I'm a monster.

1416
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,407
But what else could
I have done?

1417
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:15,248
Anyway, I couldn't help myself.

1418
01:47:17,321 --> 01:47:19,619
I hate...

1419
01:47:19,656 --> 01:47:21,715
...sex.

1420
01:47:23,193 --> 01:47:26,094
I'm sorry, but just
the idea of it...

1421
01:47:26,129 --> 01:47:28,927
of someone all over...

1422
01:47:28,966 --> 01:47:31,434
inside of me.

1423
01:47:39,876 --> 01:47:41,434
I know it isn't right...

1424
01:47:43,213 --> 01:47:46,546
...but can we still be...

1425
01:47:46,583 --> 01:47:49,416
...friends?

1426
01:47:51,421 --> 01:47:53,446
Um...

1427
01:47:55,859 --> 01:47:57,850
I guess.
Yeah.

1428
01:47:57,894 --> 01:48:01,022
Uh, I mean...

1429
01:48:01,064 --> 01:48:03,726
we all have our...

1430
01:48:03,767 --> 01:48:06,861
you know...

1431
01:48:06,903 --> 01:48:08,871
our pluses...

1432
01:48:08,905 --> 01:48:11,203
and minuses.

1433
01:48:15,912 --> 01:48:18,676
It was a crime of passion.

1434
01:48:25,589 --> 01:48:27,648
I'm a passionate woman.

1437
01:49:09,933 --> 01:49:12,561
I've had you on auto-redial all night.

1439
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:50,836
Hello?

1441
01:49:58,815 --> 01:50:00,942
Yes?

1442
01:50:01,551 --> 01:50:04,543
I'm the...

1443
01:50:04,588 --> 01:50:06,180
I'm...

1444
01:50:12,162 --> 01:50:13,891
I'm sorry?

1445
01:50:26,576 --> 01:50:28,339
Oh.

1446
01:50:30,947 --> 01:50:32,676
Come in.

1447
01:50:41,224 --> 01:50:43,055
Please...

1448
01:50:43,093 --> 01:50:45,118
have a seat.

1449
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:04,545
Drink?

1450
01:51:04,581 --> 01:51:06,947
No. Thanks.

1451
01:52:10,614 --> 01:52:12,343
This is not working.

1452
01:52:18,488 --> 01:52:20,149
No.

1453
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:25,894
You're not my type.

1454
01:52:27,597 --> 01:52:28,757
No.

1456
01:53:23,119 --> 01:53:24,984
Can I come in?

1459
01:54:51,074 --> 01:54:52,701
I'm sorry.

1460
01:54:54,144 --> 01:54:56,510
I wanted to...

1461
01:54:58,314 --> 01:55:00,111
Here.

1462
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:02,118
Vlad.

1464
01:55:24,874 --> 01:55:26,341
Come inside.

1465
01:55:36,052 --> 01:55:37,747
Please.

1466
01:55:58,274 --> 01:55:59,832
Joy...

1467
01:56:01,511 --> 01:56:04,344
Why you are come here?

1468
01:56:07,984 --> 01:56:10,475
I came because
I wanted to say...

1469
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:13,648
that I was sorry to your wife.

1470
01:56:14,924 --> 01:56:17,119
Zhenia is not my wife.

1471
01:56:17,627 --> 01:56:20,323
So you're not really married?

1472
01:56:23,933 --> 01:56:25,924
Zhenia love me.

1473
01:56:25,969 --> 01:56:28,403
It is problem.

1474
01:56:28,438 --> 01:56:30,929
She want be my wife, but...

1475
01:56:30,974 --> 01:56:32,908
she don't listen.

1476
01:56:32,942 --> 01:56:35,172
What can I do?

1477
01:56:36,279 --> 01:56:37,644
What can I do?

1478
01:56:38,948 --> 01:56:41,178
Come. You want I drive you New Jersey?

1479
01:56:41,217 --> 01:56:43,412
We go shopping.

1480
01:56:43,453 --> 01:56:46,422
No. I don't think that's...

1481
01:57:03,873 --> 01:57:05,636
Joy.

1482
01:57:06,743 --> 01:57:08,973
I must ask you question.

1483
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,580
Yes?

1484
01:57:13,683 --> 01:57:15,844
I very ashamed.

1485
01:57:17,754 --> 01:57:19,278
I'm sure I'll understand.

1486
01:57:19,322 --> 01:57:20,812
Good.

1487
01:57:22,825 --> 01:57:25,885
Can I borrow money?

1488
01:57:25,929 --> 01:57:28,454
It's very important.

1489
01:57:39,342 --> 01:57:42,072
- How much?
- One thousand dollars.

1490
01:57:43,613 --> 01:57:46,639
All right. Five hundred.
I need money now.

1491
01:57:49,219 --> 01:57:51,380
I... I...

1492
01:57:51,421 --> 01:57:52,615
I guess I can go to
a cash machine.

1493
01:57:52,655 --> 01:57:54,919
Good.
I know where is ATM.

1494
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:59,358
- Vlad?
- Yes.

1495
01:58:02,031 --> 01:58:04,465
Could I first,

1496
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:08,834
have my guitar
and my CD player back?

1497
01:58:16,412 --> 01:58:18,880
Okay.

1498
01:58:18,915 --> 01:58:20,542
It is deal.

1499
01:58:28,691 --> 01:58:30,750
Do you think shopping mall
in New Jersey is open tonight?

1500
01:58:30,793 --> 01:58:33,091
Yeah. Probably.

1501
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:39,131
Here.

1502
01:58:48,911 --> 01:58:50,776
I love you.

1503
01:58:50,813 --> 01:58:53,543
You love New Jersey.

1504
01:58:54,851 --> 01:58:57,183
I give you back Monday.

1505
01:58:57,220 --> 01:59:00,155
That's okay.

1506
01:59:00,189 --> 01:59:01,918
I um...

1507
01:59:01,958 --> 01:59:03,482
I probably won't
be there anyway.

1508
01:59:03,526 --> 01:59:05,118
Why no?

1509
01:59:05,161 --> 01:59:06,423
I don't know.

1510
01:59:06,462 --> 01:59:11,695
I think I now have more
sympathy for the strikers.

1511
01:59:11,734 --> 01:59:13,292
See ya.

1512
01:59:16,306 --> 01:59:19,070
Stupid American.

1513
01:59:28,151 --> 01:59:31,052
So, Billy...

1514
01:59:31,087 --> 01:59:32,349
how was school today?

1515
01:59:32,388 --> 01:59:35,357
Okay.
Ronald Farber was absent.

1516
01:59:35,391 --> 01:59:37,222
Oh?

1517
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:39,421
He was afraid of the math test.

1518
01:59:39,462 --> 01:59:41,089
So he stayed home?

1519
01:59:41,130 --> 01:59:42,791
Yeah. He cut.

1520
01:59:42,832 --> 01:59:45,323
That's terrible.
His parents...

1521
01:59:45,368 --> 01:59:48,963
Um, they don't know yet.
They're still on vacation.

1522
01:59:49,005 --> 01:59:51,030
Oh, are they gonna be upset.

1523
01:59:51,074 --> 01:59:54,066
Well, Ronald's gonna be pretty
upset when he finds out

1524
01:59:54,110 --> 01:59:55,668
that the test was canceled.

1525
01:59:55,712 --> 01:59:56,644
What happened?

1526
01:59:56,679 --> 01:59:58,977
Mrs. Paley was absent also.

1528
02:00:01,684 --> 02:00:03,174
Did you call Ronald and tell him?

1529
02:00:03,219 --> 02:00:06,484
Yeah, but, there was no answer.

1530
02:00:07,457 --> 02:00:10,017
Was Mrs. Paley sick, then?

1531
02:00:10,059 --> 02:00:13,790
Well, everyone said she was
too strung out.

1532
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:16,890
Why do people say things
like that?

1533
02:00:16,933 --> 02:00:18,423
Because she's...

1534
02:00:18,468 --> 02:00:20,095
a drug addict.

1535
02:00:20,136 --> 02:00:22,468
And how do you know?

1536
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,603
Everyone knows.

1537
02:00:25,641 --> 02:00:27,734
Well, I didn't know.
Did you know, Bill?

1538
02:00:27,777 --> 02:00:29,335
No.

1539
02:00:29,379 --> 02:00:32,041
Did you hear that, Billy?

1540
02:00:32,081 --> 02:00:34,845
Well, it's what everyone says,
she's a junkie.

1541
02:00:34,884 --> 02:00:37,216
And she's probably
gonna get fired.

1542
02:00:37,253 --> 02:00:38,811
It's really sad.

1543
02:00:38,855 --> 02:00:40,880
Well, if Mrs. Paley turns out,
in fact, to be a junkie,

1544
02:00:40,923 --> 02:00:43,653
then she should be fired.
Don't you think so, Bill?

1545
02:00:44,627 --> 02:00:46,094
I don't know.

1546
02:00:46,129 --> 02:00:47,926
Don't you think that's...

1547
02:00:47,964 --> 02:00:49,989
a little harsh?

1548
02:00:50,032 --> 02:00:52,626
I mean, it's not
affecting her work.

1549
02:00:52,668 --> 02:00:55,102
Well, apparently it is.

1550
02:00:55,138 --> 02:00:58,232
No. In fact, I don't think
it's a little harsh at all.

1551
02:00:58,274 --> 02:01:01,004
I'm sorry, but when it comes
to drug abuse and children,

1552
02:01:01,043 --> 02:01:02,806
my children,

1553
02:01:02,845 --> 02:01:05,575
they should be locked up
and throw away the key.

1554
02:01:05,615 --> 02:01:09,551
I want you to know, if you ever
even think of doing drugs

1555
02:01:09,585 --> 02:01:11,883
and end up dying in a hospital,

1556
02:01:11,921 --> 02:01:14,446
I'd disown you. That's how
strongly I feel about it.

1557
02:01:14,490 --> 02:01:16,924
- Trish.
- No. I know I may sound harsh,

1558
02:01:16,959 --> 02:01:18,984
but I'm talking about our kids.

1559
02:01:19,028 --> 02:01:21,895
Not to be grandiose,
but this is the future...

1560
02:01:21,931 --> 02:01:25,367
the future of our country we're
taking about, after all.

1562
02:01:31,374 --> 02:01:33,308
Hello?

1563
02:01:33,342 --> 02:01:34,969
Who's calling, please?

1564
02:01:35,011 --> 02:01:36,103
Oh, hi.
Sure, hold on.

1565
02:01:36,145 --> 02:01:37,407
It's Joe Grasso.

1566
02:01:37,447 --> 02:01:40,473
Oh. Great.

1567
02:01:48,558 --> 02:01:50,321
Hey, Joe. What's up?

1568
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:51,951
How's Johnny doing?

1569
02:01:51,994 --> 02:01:53,962
You're a dead man.

1570
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:02,631
Oh, good.

1571
02:02:02,672 --> 02:02:03,832
Good.

1572
02:02:05,007 --> 02:02:07,237
No problem.

1573
02:02:07,276 --> 02:02:09,608
Right.

1574
02:02:09,645 --> 02:02:11,237
Okay. Well, take care.

1575
02:02:12,682 --> 02:02:14,377
Bye.

1576
02:02:15,218 --> 02:02:17,277
How's Johnny doing?

1577
02:02:20,022 --> 02:02:21,580
Uh...

1578
02:02:21,624 --> 02:02:23,216
fine.

1579
02:02:26,262 --> 02:02:28,560
- Never better.
- Good.

1580
02:02:28,598 --> 02:02:30,896
We bought those
"Beauty and The Beast" tickets.

1581
02:02:30,933 --> 02:02:33,163
I don't think
Billy has anyone else.

1582
02:02:33,202 --> 02:02:36,137
No. He did cancel...

1584
02:02:37,473 --> 02:02:40,237
- Who could that be?
- I'll get it.

1585
02:02:46,682 --> 02:02:49,242
- Who is it?
- Police.

1586
02:02:55,491 --> 02:02:58,051
- Can I help you?
- Are you William Maplewood?

1587
02:02:58,094 --> 02:02:59,618
Yes.

1588
02:02:59,662 --> 02:03:01,527
We're sorry to disturb you,
but we have some questions

1589
02:03:01,564 --> 02:03:02,724
for you and your wife.

1590
02:03:02,765 --> 02:03:05,632
It has to do with your son's
friend, Johnny Grasso?

1591
02:03:05,668 --> 02:03:08,034
Did something...?

1592
02:03:09,539 --> 02:03:11,336
Come this way.

1593
02:03:11,374 --> 02:03:13,308
Go ahead, please.

1594
02:03:14,944 --> 02:03:16,377
Thank you.

1595
02:03:23,319 --> 02:03:25,287
Sit, please.

1596
02:03:25,321 --> 02:03:27,551
Who is it?

1597
02:03:29,725 --> 02:03:31,955
We were just
finishing our dinner.

1598
02:03:31,994 --> 02:03:33,427
Umm...

1599
02:03:33,462 --> 02:03:35,930
I'll be right back.

1600
02:03:44,373 --> 02:03:46,364
The police.

1601
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:49,375
You take care of the kids.

1602
02:03:52,315 --> 02:03:54,249
Sorry.

1603
02:03:55,985 --> 02:03:57,885
Now...

1604
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:01,947
you said something about
Ronald Farber?

1605
02:04:01,991 --> 02:04:04,050
Excuse me?

1606
02:04:07,530 --> 02:04:11,330
I'm sorry, I mean,

1607
02:04:11,367 --> 02:04:13,995
I mean, Johnny Grasso?

1608
02:04:19,175 --> 02:04:21,973
Mom, I don't want to go.

1609
02:04:22,011 --> 02:04:23,273
We'll be right there.

1610
02:04:23,312 --> 02:04:24,802
Billy, come on,
the bus is here.

1611
02:04:24,847 --> 02:04:26,747
Come on. Honey,
please, not today.

1612
02:04:26,782 --> 02:04:30,980
Wait!

1613
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:33,079
I'll take you boys myself.

1614
02:05:35,484 --> 02:05:37,850
Dad?

1615
02:05:39,889 --> 02:05:41,948
Yes, Billy?

1616
02:05:44,527 --> 02:05:47,655
Everyone at school
is saying things about you.

1618
02:05:49,465 --> 02:05:51,399
Who is everyone?

1619
02:05:51,434 --> 02:05:53,994
Like, kids, you know.
Everyone.

1620
02:05:55,304 --> 02:05:57,329
What are they saying?

1621
02:05:57,373 --> 02:05:59,238
That... you're...

1622
02:05:59,275 --> 02:06:01,300
...a serial rapist.

1623
02:06:01,343 --> 02:06:04,176
And a pervert.

1624
02:06:05,281 --> 02:06:08,182
You mean, like what they
painted on the house?

1625
02:06:12,655 --> 02:06:16,819
Dad, did you, um...

1626
02:06:16,859 --> 02:06:18,258
uh...

1627
02:06:18,294 --> 02:06:20,228
with... Johnny Grasso

1628
02:06:20,262 --> 02:06:22,321
and Ronald Farber?

1629
02:06:33,109 --> 02:06:35,236
Yes.

1630
02:06:37,513 --> 02:06:40,710
What... did you do?

1631
02:06:45,488 --> 02:06:47,979
I touched them.

1632
02:06:48,023 --> 02:06:50,491
What do you mean,
exactly, touched?

1633
02:06:56,766 --> 02:06:59,166
I fondled them.

1634
02:06:59,201 --> 02:07:01,362
What for?

1635
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:06,671
I couldn't help myself.

1636
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:10,542
What else?

1637
02:07:15,818 --> 02:07:19,515
I...

1638
02:07:19,555 --> 02:07:21,989
I unzipped myself.

1639
02:07:22,024 --> 02:07:26,085
You...
you mean, masturbated?

1640
02:07:28,998 --> 02:07:30,397
No.

1641
02:07:32,668 --> 02:07:34,226
Then what?

1642
02:07:36,038 --> 02:07:37,903
I...

1643
02:07:40,209 --> 02:07:42,905
made love.

1644
02:07:44,847 --> 02:07:48,214
What do you mean?

1645
02:07:51,487 --> 02:07:53,853
I fucked them.

1646
02:07:57,326 --> 02:07:59,556
What was it like?

1647
02:08:05,234 --> 02:08:07,668
It was...

1648
02:08:09,171 --> 02:08:11,162
it was great.

1649
02:08:13,209 --> 02:08:16,474
Would you do it again?

1650
02:08:25,721 --> 02:08:27,916
Yes.

1651
02:08:30,392 --> 02:08:32,087
Would...

1652
02:08:33,696 --> 02:08:35,061
would you ever...

1653
02:08:35,097 --> 02:08:37,088
fuck me?

1654
02:08:41,804 --> 02:08:43,863
No.

1655
02:08:52,281 --> 02:08:54,340
I'd jerk off instead.

1657
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:33,718
I don't wanna go.
Where are we going?

1658
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:38,818
- Mom, I don't wanna go.
- Shh! Just get in the car.

1659
02:09:38,861 --> 02:09:42,297
Wait, my Tamagotchi.
My Tamagotchi.

1660
02:10:24,373 --> 02:10:26,807
So, who used to live
here before?

1661
02:10:27,643 --> 02:10:30,578
Another couple, the Heller's.

1662
02:10:30,612 --> 02:10:33,103
What happened to them?

1663
02:10:33,148 --> 02:10:35,139
They got divorced.

1664
02:10:38,854 --> 02:10:41,482
Anyway, the police came and
looked in her freezer

1665
02:10:41,523 --> 02:10:44,321
and found baggies filled
with the doorman's genitals.

1666
02:10:46,662 --> 02:10:49,290
- I use baggies.
- Me, too.

1667
02:10:49,331 --> 02:10:52,664
Everyone uses baggies.
That's why we can relate to this crime.

1668
02:10:52,701 --> 02:10:55,465
- Don't you see?
- I can't relate to it.

1669
02:10:59,742 --> 02:11:00,367
In any case,

1670
02:11:00,409 --> 02:11:03,936
there's this guy I've met, Joy,
that I'd think you'd like.

1671
02:11:03,979 --> 02:11:06,243
He's in computers,
I think.

1672
02:11:06,281 --> 02:11:09,341
- How did you meet him?
- He's a neighbor of mine.

1673
02:11:09,385 --> 02:11:12,115
You want to call him, or should
I give him your number?

1674
02:11:12,154 --> 02:11:13,678
I'll call him.

1675
02:11:13,722 --> 02:11:16,987
That'll be great.
I think he'll really like that.

1676
02:11:18,227 --> 02:11:21,196
- What about me?
- I'm looking. I'm looking.

1677
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:22,788
I like computers.

1678
02:11:24,166 --> 02:11:27,727
Trish, trust me on this one.

1679
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:30,603
He's not for you.

1680
02:11:31,974 --> 02:11:34,067
And what about me?

1681
02:11:34,109 --> 02:11:36,509
I haven't forgotten, mom,
it's just...

1682
02:11:36,545 --> 02:11:39,378
it's hard.

1683
02:11:39,415 --> 02:11:42,384
But, I'm looking for everyone.

1684
02:11:42,418 --> 02:11:44,613
Well, don't look for me.

1685
02:11:44,653 --> 02:11:47,645
- Have you found somebody?
- No. There's no one.

1686
02:11:53,495 --> 02:11:55,463
I heard Diane had a stroke.

1687
02:11:57,499 --> 02:11:58,966
She'll recover.

1688
02:11:59,001 --> 02:12:01,333
Um, well that's good.

1689
02:12:01,370 --> 02:12:02,928
Where there's
life there's hope.

1690
02:12:02,971 --> 02:12:04,563
That's right.

1691
02:12:04,606 --> 02:12:08,372
- You bet.
- Absolutely.

1692
02:12:08,410 --> 02:12:09,570
Yeah.

1693
02:12:11,380 --> 02:12:14,247
Could you pass the sweet
potatoes, please?

1694
02:12:15,084 --> 02:12:16,642
Here.

1695
02:12:22,124 --> 02:12:24,285
Did anyone watch Leno
last night?

1696
02:12:27,796 --> 02:12:30,663
Timmy. Oh, Timmy.

1697
02:12:30,699 --> 02:12:34,135
Timmy, come over
and sit on Grandma's lap.

1698
02:12:34,169 --> 02:12:37,070
Timmy. Timmy, what?

1699
02:12:37,106 --> 02:12:38,971
Timmy?

1700
02:12:39,007 --> 02:12:40,804
What's the matter with Timmy?

1701
02:12:40,843 --> 02:12:42,674
His Tamagotchi died.

1702
02:12:44,446 --> 02:12:46,038
Tamagotchi?

1703
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:53,647
Helen, so what's gonna happen
to that woman

1704
02:12:53,689 --> 02:12:55,179
who killed your doorman?

1705
02:12:55,224 --> 02:12:57,317
I don't know, mom.

1706
02:12:58,227 --> 02:12:59,990
It's so sad.

1707
02:13:00,028 --> 02:13:02,792
She's all alone.

1708
02:13:03,899 --> 02:13:06,333
I just wish I'd gotten to
know her better.

1709
02:13:07,236 --> 02:13:09,033
We might have found we had
something in common.

1710
02:13:09,071 --> 02:13:11,767
Maybe you'll write a poem about her.

1712
02:13:17,279 --> 02:13:21,010
Joy, I'm so sorry.

1713
02:13:21,049 --> 02:13:22,311
But...

1714
02:13:22,351 --> 02:13:24,148
don't worry.

1715
02:13:24,186 --> 02:13:26,780
I'm not laughing at you.

1716
02:13:26,822 --> 02:13:28,551
I'm laughing with you.

1717
02:13:28,590 --> 02:13:30,888
But I'm not laughing.

1720
02:14:28,750 --> 02:14:31,878
Let's make a toast.

1721
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:34,912
- To happiness.
- To happiness.

1722
02:14:34,957 --> 02:14:36,219
To happiness.

1723
02:14:38,427 --> 02:14:40,190
Kookie.

1724
02:14:41,296 --> 02:14:42,957
Kookie.

1725
02:14:44,499 --> 02:14:46,729
I... I came.
