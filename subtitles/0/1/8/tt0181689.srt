00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,392
Because of the nature of murder.

311
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,437
"There's nothing more destructive
to the metaphysical fabric that binds us

312
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,398
"than the untimely murder
of one human being by another."

313
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,983
Somehow, l don't think
that was Walt Whitman.

314
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,401
It's Iris Hineman.

315
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:27,197
She developed the Precogs, designed
the system and pioneered the interface.

316
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,991
WITWER: Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

317
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,327
-To Hineman?
-To them.

318
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,456
JOHN: Cops aren't
allowed inside the temple.

319
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,625
Really? You've never been inside?

320
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:42,420
We keep strict separations so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

321
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,173
So, I'll be the first one to go in, then?

322
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,093
-Maybe you didn't hear me.
-lf it's a question of authority...

323
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:52,013
No, there is no question.
You don't have any.

324
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,559
l have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

325
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,740
-Show it to me.
-Sure.

326
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,123
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel

327
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,083
is being conducted
under the direct supervision

328
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,087
and express permission from the
Attorney General of the United States.

329
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,131
I'm here as his representative,

330
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:30,301
which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

331
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,684
Seems you've been
left out of the loop, John.

332
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,071
FLETCHER:
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

333
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,121
Hold it right there. Hold it.

334
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,415
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Not cleared for access.

(BEEPING)

336
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,711
Eye-dent, John Anderton. Approved.

337
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,595
-Wally.
-(SOFTLY) No, no, no, no.

338
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,013
It's okay. This is Danny Witwer.

339
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,265
He's from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

340
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,349
l can't touch you.

341
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,602
-Don't touch him or anything else.
-John, you can't be in here...

342
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,771
l understand. Just answer his questions
and we'll get the hell out of here.

343
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,856
Tell me how...

344
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,982
(SHUSHING)

345
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,944
-They're sleeping.
-Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

346
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,740
The photon milk acts as both
a nutrient supply and a liquid conductor.

347
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,451
It enhances the images
that each of them receive.

348
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,246
We call the female Agatha.
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.

349
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,374
We scan by way of optical tomography.

350
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,211
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the entire length of the headgear,

351
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,756
and they're reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

352
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,926
In other words, we see what they see.

353
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,511
They don't feel any pain.

354
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,264
We keep their heads pretty well stocked
with dopamine and endorphins.

355
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,185
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

356
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,979
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

357
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,940
They can't be kept too awake, either.

358
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:10,151
It's better if
you don't think of them as human.

359
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,987
No. They're much more than that.

360
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,785
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

361
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,041
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

362
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,045
l find it interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Precogs.

363
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,256
The Precogs are
pattern-recognition filters, that's all.

364
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,759
-Yet you call this room "the temple."
-Just a nickname.

365
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,053
The oracle isn't
where the power is, anyway.

366
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,763
The power's always been
with the priests,

367
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,516
even if they had to invent the oracle.

368
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,479
You guys are nodding like you actually
know what the hell he's talking about.

369
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,066
Well, come on, Chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all,

370
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,278
l mean,
we're more like clergy than cops.

371
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,113
-Jad?
-Yeah?

372
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,782
Go to work. All of you.

373
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,210
Sorry. Old habit.

374
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,714
l spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before l became a cop.

375
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,549
My father was very proud.

376
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,426
What does he think
of your chosen line of work?

377
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,594
l don't know.
He was shot and killed when l was 1 5

378
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,264
on the steps of our church in Dublin.

379
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,058
l know what it's like
to lose someone close, John.

380
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,394
Of course,
nothing is like the loss of a child.

381
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,687
l don't have any children of my own,

382
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,107
so l can only imagine
what that must have been like.

383
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,652
To lose your son
in such a public place like that.

384
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,529
At least now you and l have
the chance to make sure

385
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,156
that kind of thing
doesn't happen to anyone.

386
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,907
Why don't you cut the cute act,
Danny Boy, and tell me

387
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,493
-exactly what it is you're looking for.
-Flaws.

388
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,661
There hasn't been a murder in six years.

389
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,330
There's nothing wrong with the system.
It is...

390
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:49,250
Perfect. l agree.
lf there's a flaw, it's human.

391
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,003
It always is.

392
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,464

Can you see?

396
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,885
John, what the hell just happened?

397
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,512
Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

398
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,764
-What did you do to her?
-She grabbed me.

399
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,183
Grabbed you? That's impossible.
The Precogs aren't even aware of us.

400
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,019
-In the milk, all they see is the future.
-She looked straight at me.

401
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,146
It could have been a nightmare.

402
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,106
Sometimes they dream
about the old murders.

403
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,191
-She spoke to me.
-To you?

404
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,529
-What'd she say?
-"Can you see?"

-l got plenty of those. Kill type?

-Drowning.
-That narrows it down.

She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

This is the official composite
of the three Precogs?

He drowned a woman

The killer's a John Doe.
Never identified.

00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,307
Why is he still a John Doe?

436
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,475
Why wasn't he ever ID'd
from the eye-scan?

437
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,603
On account of those are not his eyes.

He had them swapped out
to fool the scanners.

See? We have the two previsions.

We got what Art saw,
we got what Dash saw,

but Agatha's isn't here.

449
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,394
Probably just a glitch.

Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

451
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,153
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here,

but l show an address history
that includes the Beaton Clinic.

out of here, Chief.

It's against the rules.

that's against the rules?

No. No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

That's not all.
l spent a few hours down there,

-It's stress.
-What's this?

468
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,558
Herbal tea with honey.

469
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,728
l hate herbal tea,
almost as much as l hate honey.

470
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,772
Just drink it before l pour it in your lap.

-Can l get you anything, John?
-No, thank you, Celeste.

Tour of Containment tomorrow.

-What?

a lot of time in the sprawl.

-In the middle of the night?

What if Danny Witwer
came to you right now

-and insisted on a full chem run?
-Lamar, I'm fine.

You understand, John,

482
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,978
the minute Precrime goes national,
they're going to take it away from us.

483
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,313
We won't let them.

484

No? How's an old man and a cop
on the whiff ever going to stop them?

485
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,821
My father once said to me,

486
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:20,034
"You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you."

487
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,328
There's a reason you are here, John.

488
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,872
Had Precrime been in place
just six months earlier,

489
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,375

would have been prevented.

I'm not the generation anyone listens to.

But people trust you, John.

When you speak
of your absolute belief in Precrime,

496
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,646
they know it's a belief born of pain,
not politics. l always understood that.

497
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,316
And l may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

498
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,030
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.

despite what we did for them.

741

to them. But it doesn't matter.

What?

754
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:02,098
Most of the time, all three Precognitives

760
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,783
there can't be
any suggestion of fallibility.

761
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,245
After all, who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

762
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,206
It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

764
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,339
I'm saying that every so often

might, just might,

768
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,061
Well, in my experience,
parents very often see their children

769
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,022
as they want them to be, not as they are.

770
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,606
Answer my question.

771
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,444
Does Lamar Burgess know
about the minority report?

772
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:58,612
Yes, of course, he knew.

773
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,656
But at the time, he felt, we both felt,

774
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,951
that their existence
was an insignificant variable.

775
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:05,786
Insignificant to you, maybe,

776
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,999
but what about those people
that l put away with alternate futures?

777
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,460
My God, if the country knew
there was a chance...

778
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,545
The system would collapse.

779
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,883
-l believe in that system.
-Do you really?

780
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,092
You want to bring it down.

781
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:24,180
You will bring it down,
if you manage to kill your victim.

782
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:27,516
Why, that will be
the most spectacular public display

783
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,894
of how Precrime didn't work.

784
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,147
-I'm not gonna kill anybody.
-Hold that thought.

785
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,523
Why should l trust you?

786
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,359
You shouldn't.
You shouldn't trust anyone.

787
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:39,570
Certainly not the Attorney General,
who just wants it all for himself.

788
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,698
And not the young federal agent
who wants your job.

789
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,618
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang onto what he created.

790
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,747
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the minority report.

791
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,627
You said
the minority report's destroyed.

792
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,172
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

793
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,050
l designed the system
so that whenever a report occurred,

794
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,011
it would be stored in a safe place,
but not declared.

795
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,055
What safe place is that?

796
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:09,225
The safest place there is.

797
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:12,019
Where is it?

798
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,234
Inside the Precog who predicted it.

799
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:27,326
All you have to do
is download it, darling.

800
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,288
That's all, huh?

801
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,753
Just walk right into Precrime,
get in the temple,

802
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:42,425
somehow tap into these Precogs,
and then download this minority report.

803
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,219
-lf you have one.
-And then walk out.

804
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:50,141
Actually, l think you'll have to run out,
but, yes, that is what you have to do.

805
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,184
You're insane.

806
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,020
Or you think l am.

807
01:02:55,814 --> 01:03:01,026
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before l get within 1 0 miles of Precrime!

808
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:06,073
Sometimes, in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

809
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:09,452
As a policeman...
Oh, excuse me, as a former policeman,

810
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:12,037
I'm sure that you know
all sorts of people

811
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,707
who can help you out in this regard.

812
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,675
It's funny
how all living organisms are alike.

813
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,762
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on,

814
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:33,267
every creature on the face of the Earth
is interested in one thing

815
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,060
and one thing only.

816
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,230
Its own survival.

817
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,526
Find the minority report.

818
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:50,493
How do l even know which one has it?

819
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,454
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

820
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,208
Which one is that?

821
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,754
The female.

822
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,717
FLETCHER: All right,
here's where we're at.

823
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,886
Three men in a room.
The victim is here.

824
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,807
John is here. And this unidentified male,
out the window.

825
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,935
Now, the adjacent building
suggests public housing,

826
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,811
but l can't make out the location,
which means...

827
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,313
There's thousands of units like this one.

828
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,689
Yeah, they're everywhere.

829
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:23,150
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

830
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,401
Excuse me,
this is Chief Anderton's space.

831
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,528
Casey, he's okay.

832
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,112
-You can't sit in his space.
-He's not here anymore.

833
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,531
-He'll be back.
-l doubt that.

834
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,782
-What happened to you?
-It's okay.

835
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,951
In the meantime, I'm betting
he's somewhere in the sprawl.

836
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,078
Anderton's smart enough to
go where electronic billboards

837
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,829
and other media can't ID him
to pick his pockets.

838
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:38,415
There's fewer consumers there, which
means fewer scanners to target him.

839
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,044
-Why won't he just run?
-Because he thinks he's innocent.

840
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,131
We concentrate on the sprawl.

841
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,385
Do flyovers in shifts
with two spyder teams on the ground.

842
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:53,764
Thermal scan the entire area,
read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

843
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:10,823

You see, l could cut open your chest

850
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:47,693
you would never get an infection.

I'll be shooting into you.

That's comforting.

l can't just give you new irises.

Please don't touch.

855
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,790
Because the scanners will read
the new scar tissue, alarms will go off,

856
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,668
and large men with guns will appear.

Approved for entry.

WALLY: l want to get a new dog.

1074
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,595
Which l told her l should be able to do

1075
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:02,221
because I'm so good
at taking care of you guys.

1076
01:25:02,306 --> 01:25:06,058
But she thinks that I'll be irresponsible,
which is ridiculous.

1077
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:14,525
No, no, no, no! You can't be in here!
No, no! What are you doing here?

01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,155
No, no, no, no!

1079

Easy there, old-timer. Who cleared you?
You are not supposed to be in here.

1080

-Listen, Wally.
-Do l know you? Who are you?

1081
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:28,247
l like you, Wally. So, l don't want to have
to kick you or hit you with anything hard,

1082
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,500

1086
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,815
It's Agatha.

1087
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:56,067
He's coming here to get her.

1088
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:01,864
-Are these all of her previsions?
-I'm rewinding her right now.

1089
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,828
l don't need to see all these.
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

1090
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,496
I'm looking.
They're not coming out in any order.

1091
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,414
I'm just getting them as she's giving.

1092
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,087
Can you see?

1093
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:32,353
-He's inside.
-He's got some kind of mask on.

1094
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:33,980
He sealed the door from the inside.

1095
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:36,190
Shit! Nobody fires a weapon
inside the temple.

1096
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,943
Use only bindfoam or your sick-sticks.
Is there another way out of there?

1097
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,153
We've got all the doors covered.
There's no way he's getting out.

1098
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:44,031
John, move away from the tank!

1099

-What does he want with the Precog?
-What do you think?

1104
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:09,765
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing about it!

1105
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,475
But there's still the other two.

1106
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:15,062
Wally! Wally!
The other two can still function, right?

1107
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:17,064
You don't understand.
They're a hive mind.

1108
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:20,610
It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

1109

Are you telling me
they can't see murders anymore?

1110
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,451
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males,
but Agatha, she's the key.

1111

She's the one they listen to,
the one with the most talent.

We'll stop him in the reservoir.

when he kills Crow.

She's already a part of his future.

1120

Jad, put everything you've got
into finding that room,

1121
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,599
and we stop a murder.

1122

Can you tell me if...

Yes, this is all happening right now.

We've gotta take you
some place in public,

which means I've gotta get you
something else to wear.

Welcome back to the Gap!

for another pair of
those Shimmy Lace Ups?

1141
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:19,854
JAD: lf he's ransoming her,
where's the damn note?

1142
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,939
It has nothing to do with ransom.

1143
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,192
It has to do with the information
that's inside of Agatha.

1144
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,738
He's trying to prove his innocence.

1145

But he can't download her
without a lot of technical support.

1146

Well, your average consumer
can't buy any of this stuff

1147
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:36,203
because it's been assembled

"Look, Ma, l can fly" fantasies,

1154

everything from bungee jumping

to soaring like an eagle
over the Grand Canyon.

Every day for the last six years,
I've thought about only two things.

1277

The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today,

if l would recognize him
if l saw him on the street,

1279
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:32,873
and second is what l would do
to the man who took him.

l am going to kill this man.

You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

01:49:58,217 --> 01:50:02,262
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1378
01:50:05,057 --> 01:50:06,724
Lamar?

1379
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:15,108
-What?
-WITWER: Lamar, there's something

1380
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:17,443
terribly wrong.
We're chasing the wrong man.

1381
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:18,569
What?

1382
01:50:18,654 --> 01:50:20,238
WITWER:
I don't wanna say over the phone.

1383
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:22,073
Meet me at Anderton's.

1384
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:25,535
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1385
01:50:31,083 --> 01:50:34,877
LAMAR: l remember when l gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1386
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:37,547
WITWER: Please, sir.

1387
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,427
Tell me what you have.

1388
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:50,101
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1389
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:55,982
Yeah, John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1390
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:58,985
Yes. this is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1391
01:50:59,069 --> 01:51:01,070
Agatha's stream was missing.

1392
01:51:03,115 --> 01:51:05,450
Now this one is from the cyber parlor.

1393
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:10,079
Anderton downloaded this directly from
Agatha, and Rufus Riley recorded it.

1394
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:16,836
-It's the same prevision.
-Not quite.

1395
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:23,092
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1396
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:26,429
Moving away from shore.

1397
01:51:27,973 --> 01:51:29,307
Now the second image.

1398
01:51:29,391 --> 01:51:32,477
This is the one from Containment.
It's what Art and Dash saw.

1399
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:34,854
Watch the water.

1400
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:40,651
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1401
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:45,948
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1402
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:48,159
According to the Sentry,
Anderton was watching this

1403
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:49,869
at Containment
right before he was tagged.

1404
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:53,039
Well, l know. He came to me,
told me about the missing data stream.

1405
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,999
He was concerned that you might find it.

1406
01:51:55,084 --> 01:51:58,961
Well, he was right. l did find it.
It was inside of Agatha the whole time.

1407
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:03,633
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1408
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,970
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

1409
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:11,808
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1410
01:52:12,434 --> 01:52:13,476
How?

1411
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,270
Well, Jad told me
that sometimes the Precogs see

1412
01:52:16,355 --> 01:52:17,897
the same murder more than once.

1413
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:22,568
-It's called an echo.
-Jad called it "Precog déjà vu."

1414
01:52:22,653 --> 01:52:26,614
Well, we teach the techs
to identify them and disregard.

1415
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:32,453
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1416
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:33,913
What if what he was really looking at

1417
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:36,749
was a completely
different murder altogether?

1418
01:52:36,834 --> 01:52:39,168
l don't understand.

1419
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:41,671
All you'd have to do is
hire someone to kill Anne Lively,

1420
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,258
someone like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

1421
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,969
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place,

1422
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:53,683
haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else,

1423
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:57,103
having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes,

1424
01:52:57,187 --> 01:53:00,690
commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

1425
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:06,487
Technician takes a look,
thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it.

1426
01:53:11,702 --> 01:53:13,202
Of course, it would have to be someone

1427
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:16,122
with access to the previsions
in the first place.

1428
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:17,498
Someone fairly high up.

1429
01:53:17,583 --> 01:53:18,708
(SHUSHING)

1430
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:22,837
Do you know what l hear?

1431
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:28,384
Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs.

1432
01:53:28,469 --> 01:53:32,180
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1433
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:34,140
Do you know why l can't hear
any of those things, Danny?

1434
01:53:34,224 --> 01:53:37,727
Because right now,
the Precogs can't see a thing.

1435
01:53:37,936 --> 01:54:01,667
(GUN FIRING)

1436
01:54:02,628 --> 01:54:05,254
AGATHA: Can you see? It's beautiful.

1437
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:09,425
-Where are we going?
-JOHN: Someplace safe.

1438
01:54:09,635 --> 01:54:12,929
(BEEPING)

1439
01:54:17,142 --> 01:54:19,101
-Burgess.
-Lamar, it's Lara.

1440
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:21,646
-LAMAR: Yes, Lara.
-You have to help him.

1441
01:54:23,148 --> 01:54:25,691
-Is he there?
-Yes.

1442
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:28,861
Has he got the Precog with him?

1443
01:54:31,073 --> 01:54:34,617
-Yes.
-Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1444
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:38,746
Please. Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
l don't trust him.

1445
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:41,958
l won't say a word.

1446
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,129
You just don't let John leave, all right?

1447
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:50,174
He's no killer, Lamar.

1448
01:54:50,801 --> 01:54:52,385
l know.

1449
01:55:03,772 --> 01:55:05,273
AGATHA: It's cold.

1450
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:12,905
Lara, this is Agatha.

1451
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:23,332
You remember when l would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1452
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:31,340
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1453
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:36,220
l gotta sit down.

1454
01:55:37,556 --> 01:55:42,518
l gotta figure this out.

1455
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:23,559
JOHN: they used Sean.

1456
01:56:25,604 --> 01:56:28,230
They wanted me to
think Crow killed him.

1457
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:31,067
But he didn't.

1458
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:34,195
He didn't.

1459
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:38,407
Why would they set you up?

1460
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:48,626
Because l found out about her.

1461
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:51,837
About who?

1462
01:56:51,922 --> 01:56:55,633
-How could l not have seen this?
-Seen what?

1463
01:56:56,927 --> 01:56:58,761
Anne Lively.

1464
01:57:01,473 --> 01:57:02,932
Agatha.

1465
01:57:07,729 --> 01:57:12,358
Dr. Hineman once said, "The dead
don't die. They look on and help."

1466
01:57:13,819 --> 01:57:15,611
Remember that, John.

1467
01:57:17,114 --> 01:57:19,281
-Agatha.
-Sean.

1468
01:57:24,204 --> 01:57:28,749
He's on the beach now, toe in the water.

1469
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:33,295
He's asking you to come in with him.

1470
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:37,717
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1471
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:42,012
There's so much love in this house.

1472
01:57:47,227 --> 01:57:49,145
He's 1 0 years old.

1473
01:57:51,606 --> 01:57:53,816
He's surrounded by animals.

1474
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:57,528
He wants to be a vet.

1475
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:03,993
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1476
01:58:05,912 --> 01:58:07,705
He's in high school.

1477
01:58:08,165 --> 01:58:11,000
He likes to run, like his father.

1478
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:14,670
He runs the two-mile and the long relay.

1479
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:18,007
He's 23.

1480
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:21,343
He's at a university.

1481
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:25,181
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1482
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:27,725
He asks her to be his wife.

1483
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:31,520
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.

1484
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:39,195
He still runs across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1485
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:44,200
Oh, God.
He's running so fast, just like his daddy.

1486
01:58:45,535 --> 01:58:49,038
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

1487
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:55,169
But he's only six years old,
and he can't do it.

1488
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:58,380
And the other man is so fast.

1489
01:59:02,594 --> 01:59:05,262
There was so much love in this house.

1490
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:08,557
l want him back so bad.

1491
01:59:11,269 --> 01:59:13,020
So did she.

1492
01:59:13,855 --> 01:59:15,523
Can't you see?

1493
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:21,946
She just wanted her little girl back.

1494
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:26,700
But it was too late.

1495
01:59:28,662 --> 01:59:31,080
Her little girl was already gone.

1496
01:59:31,832 --> 01:59:33,582
She's still alive.

1497
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:39,004
She didn't die, but she's not alive.

1498
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:42,633
Agatha?

1499
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:48,389
Just tell me, who killed your mother?

1500
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:51,976
Who killed Anne Lively?

1501
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:58,607
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1502
01:59:59,442 --> 02:00:00,484
What?

1503
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:03,612
(SCREAMING) Run!

1504
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:20,004
(WHISPERING) l love you.

1505
02:00:20,797 --> 02:00:22,631
-Okay. You're okay.
-No, no.

1506
02:00:22,716 --> 02:00:25,551
-You'll be fine with them.
-No, no.

1507
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:26,886
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1508
02:00:26,970 --> 02:00:29,054
-John, no.
-Don't talk.

1509
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,532
John Anderton.

1510
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:52,703
By mandate of the
District of Columbia Precrime Division,

1511
02:00:52,787 --> 02:00:57,875
I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1512
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,588
That's it.

1513
02:01:03,173 --> 02:01:04,840
That's my girl.

1514
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:09,511
l was so worried about you.

1515
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,767
Did he hurt you?

1516
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:20,064
l missed you so much.

1517
02:01:20,148 --> 02:01:23,984
It's okay. Wally's here. Wally's here.

1518
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:33,911
You're a part of my flock now, John.
Welcome.

1519
02:01:35,372 --> 02:01:39,959
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions,

1520
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:46,256
that your life flashes before your eyes,
that all your dreams come true.

1521
02:02:03,608 --> 02:02:05,609
This is all my fault.

1522
02:02:06,945 --> 02:02:09,446
There was nothing anyone could do.

1523
02:02:12,033 --> 02:02:13,409
Lara...

1524
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:16,787
l thought you might want to have those.

1525
02:02:23,003 --> 02:02:27,464
l haven't worn this in years. l just wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1526
02:02:27,549 --> 02:02:29,216
You look great.

1527
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,470
l knew he was having trouble for some
time, and yet l did nothing about it.

1528
02:02:33,555 --> 02:02:36,181
Excuse me.
The guy from USA today is here.

1529
02:02:36,266 --> 02:02:37,307
Tell him not now.

1530
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:40,602

some closure in the fact that
