1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,203
(Group leader) All right, you got the note?
(Male singer) Yeah, right.

2
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,957
Nice and tight.
Two, three, four.

3
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,543
(♪ Male doo-wop group sings
unaccompanied harmonies)

4
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,950
(Young man) This is the Fordham section
of The Bronx... my home.

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,869
A world unto itself.

6
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,163
You can get to any borough
in 15 minutes from here,

7
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,916
but they might as well be
3,000 miles away.

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,836
That's Mount Carmel Church.

9
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,881
And the sound of the bells
would fill the neighbourhood.

10
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,937
It was 1960, and doo-wop
was the sound on the streets.

11
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,985
It felt like there was a doo-wop
group on every corner back then.

12
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,824
What a time it was!

13
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,494
The New York Yankees were playing
the Pittsburgh Pirates

14
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,037
in the World Series...

15
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,623
and Mickey Mantle
was like a god to me.

16
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,585
My dad would take me to Yankee Stadium
and we'd watch the Yankees win.

17
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,633
That's the Chez Bippy -
that's where all the guys hung out.

18
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,094
But I'll tell you about them later.

19
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,684
That's my building.
I live right there on the third floor.

20
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,520
667 East 187th Street.

21
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,816
There's my stoop.

22
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,655
And on warm summer nights
all through the neighbourhood...

23
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,741
you would hear young Italian men
romancing their women.

24
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,827
(Shouts) Hey, Marie!

25
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,830
- Get in the fucking car!
- No!

26
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,416
- Get in the car!
- Leave me alone.

27
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,002
- Come on, baby, you know I love you.
- Yeah, bullshit.

28
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,129
(Shouts) Will ya get in the fucking car!

29
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,932
And right there,

30
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,393
right there under that lamppost there,
stood the man -

31
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,521
the number-one man
in the neighbourhood... Sonny.

32
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,525
Everybody loved Sonny
and treated him like a god.

33
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,488
And in my neighbourhood,
he was a god.

34
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:22,075
And I would sit on my stoop
and watch him, all day and all night.

35
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,287
But he would never even
look at me.

36
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,165
Never, until one day.

37
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,760
(Woman) - What do you want?
- You got room in there for us?

38
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,428
You wish!

39
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,376
- Oh, shit!
- Let's go!

40
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,324
That's my dad, Lorenzo Anello.

41
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,913
His bus route was 187th Street.
I used to love to ride the bus with him.

42
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,166
That's me, Calogero,
nine years old.

43
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,939
- All right. See you later, Pop.
- OK.

44
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,365
Go right upstairs, son.

45
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:53,286
That's my mum, Rosina.
She met my dad at a dance.

46
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,123
They fell in love
and they've been together ever since.

47
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,676
(Faintly heard) You're always listening.
Take care of this fucking...

48
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,268
Come on. Knock him out!

49
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,488
The Chez Bippy.
This is where all the guys hung out.

50
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,741
Get the fuck out of here!
Take a walk!

51
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,453
Tony Toupee was owner of the bar
in name only.

52
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,497
It was really Sonny's place.

53
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,461
Tony was a frustrated singer
and everybody hated his voice.

54
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:10,590
So just for spite, he'd never utter
a spoken word - he would only sing it.

55
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,219
They called him Tony Toupee because
he wore the worst hairpiece in the world.

56
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,686
Eddie Mush was a degenerate gambler
and the biggest loser in the world.

57
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,812
♪ My love... ♪

58
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,523
They called him "Mush" because
everything he touched turned to mush.

59
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,858
Never mind "Eddie my love",
I need a winner!

60
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,320
At the race track, the teller would
give him his tickets already ripped up.

61
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,406
I had the Yankees. They lost.

62
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,118
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

63
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,288
JoJo the Whale.

64
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,040
You didn't walk with JoJo,
you walked among him.

65
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,294
If you stared at JoJo long enough,
you'd see him get fatter by the hour.

66
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,339
Legend has it his shadow
once killed a dog.

67
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,927
They called him
Frankie Coffeecake...

68
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,347
because his face looked like
a Drake's Coffeecake.

69
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,142
He was tough to look at.

70
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,032
Hey, kid, how you doin'?

71
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,453
His name was Jimmy Whispers
and he was Sonny's main man.

72
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,582
They called him "Whispers" because
everything was a secret to him.

73
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,048
Danny K.O. Knocked guys out...

74
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,009
and Bobby Bars
spent half his life behind them.

75
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,013
This was Sonny's crew,
and nobody fucked with these guys.

76
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:45,935
What are ya doin' here?
Didn't we tell you not to come here?

77
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,439
Didn't I tell ya not to come upstairs!
Wait till I tell your father!

78
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,193
- What were you doing here?
- I was looking for Daddy.

79
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,611
Well that's very nice!

80
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,448
I have to get somethin' in the store.
Don't move!

81
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,326
You wait right here! You hear me?

82
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:08,124
Every time I saw Sonny, I'd try to imitate
him, but he'd never even look at me.

83
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,256
Sonny had five fingers...

84
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,425
but he only used three.

85
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,138
Come on. Let's go.
Move. Upstairs.

86
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,690
I'm not in the mood for steak.

87
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,025
Oh, you're not?

88
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,861
How many times do I have to drive
that bus back and forth...

89
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,905
so this family can eat steak
once a week?

90
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,699
- Seven.
- Who told you that?

91
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,033
Nobody. I counted.

92
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,202
Calogero, your father wants
to talk to you.

93
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,914
- About what, Dad?
- Mum caught you by the bar today.

94
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,333
- I wasn't.
- Tell your father the truth!

95
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,919
- I was by the bar.
- So why'd you lie?

96
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,171
- I took a shot.
- Wanna do something here?

97
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,340
What am I gonna say?
Nice try, son.

98
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,968
- Thanks, Dad.
- Lorenzo, come on, please!

99
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,345
How can I keep him away?
It's two doors away.

100
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,556
Daddy's right.
You should listen to him.

101
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,433
Shut up.
Nobody's talking to you.

102
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,476
Give me your plate.

103
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,689
I want you to listen to me.
Hey! Do not go near the bar.

104
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,984
Stay on the stoop,
but keep away from the bar.

105
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,945
- When you're older, you'll understand.
- Yes.

106
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,158
- You don't see me going there.
- Mum won't let you go there either?

107
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,369
- What am I going to do?
- I don't know. I got him all day.

108
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,164
I'm just kidding.
I'll won't go near the bar.

109
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,255
Look what I got. Two tickets,
Yankee Stadium, centre field.

110
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,507
- Behind the Mick?
- Right behind number seven.

111
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,343
- Now eat your steak.
- Yeah!

112
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,475
Let's go, Alfie.

113
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,894
That's Phil the Peddler.

114
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,062
He would call everybody "Mary."

115
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,107
Me and my friends would
love to break his balls.

116
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,321
Slick and Crazy Mario
were my best friends.

117
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,990
Slick got his name
because of his hair.

118
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,743
Mario got his
because he was just crazy.

119
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,665
I'll kick your little fucking asses,
you bunch of Marys.

120
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,504
Stay away from the fruit!
Keep your hands off the fruit!

121
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,172
You fucking Marys!

122
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,425
I'll kick you loose, you Marys!
The three of you!

123
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,262
I'll kick your fucking asses,
you fucking ball breakers!

124
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:31,059
Keep your hands off the vegetables!
What do you think this is?

125
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,270
Wait! Go make your mother
and father feed you!

126
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,274
I'll give you the heave-ho,
you fucking ball breakers!

127
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,110
- How many did you get?
- I got one.

128
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,071
(Indistinct)
...stop borrowing money!

129
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,573
(Slick) Oh, boy -
Coffeecake's in trouble again!

130
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,035
(Slick)
Somebody's gonna get their ass kicked.

131
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,330
Guys, check it out.
Mario, who's this?

132
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,591
That's Jimmy Whispers.

133
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,220
You'd better talk to him again.
You're responsible for him.

134
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,305
Whoa! Come on, wait a minute.

135
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,563
It's Sonny.

136
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:21,025
You do somebody now,
big mouth.

137
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,278
Do somebody hard,
like Coffeecake.

138
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,447
- I can't do Coffeecake!
- That's hard.

139
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,201
Put a screen in front of your
face while I throw shit at it.

140
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,995
(Pneumatic hiss)

141
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,413
Oh, shit.

142
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,500
These niggers got some balls,
coming in our neighbourhood.

143
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,169
They don't live here,
they just pass through from school.

144
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,047
- How the fuck do you know?
- My father told me.

145
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,342
My father told me
that's how it starts.

146
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,930
Get the fuck out of our neighbourhood,
you fucking niggers!

147
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,141
Go back to Australia
where you came from!

148
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,977
You're lucky
you're on that bus!

149
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,313
Ha ha, you missed me!

150
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,273
Stay out of our neighbourhood!

151
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,317
(Sharp whistle)

152
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,697
Why?

153
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,005
You don't fucking stop.
Get the fuck out of here!

154
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,591
Nobody's cooler than you, Sonny.

155
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,259
(Car horn)

156
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,056
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What you doin'?

157
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,850
- Fuck you, you freehole!
- Fuck you, you scumbag!

158
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,853
You're a real motherfucker!
I'll bust your fucking head!

159
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,024
I'm gonna bust your fucking head!

160
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,284
Hold on here.

161
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,287
Sonny, give me the gun!

162
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,331
- Get the fucking car!
- Move the fucking car!

163
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,251
Come on!

164
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,973
When Sonny looked at me
for the first time, I went deaf.

165
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,683
I couldn't hear.

166
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,644
All I could see was Sonny
with the gun in his hand.

167
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,838
What happened?
Is he all right?

168
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,715
Dad, it was just
a parking space.

169
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,092
- You don't understand.
- Is he all right?

170
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,302
- Baby, are you OK?
- He's all right. Let's go inside.

171
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,596
- What happened?
- I'm OK, Mum, I'm OK.

172
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,683
- Oh, my god, I got so scared.
- I'm OK, Mum.

173
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,064
You don't understand, Dad.
They were fighting over a parking space.

174
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,650
- Over a parking space?
- Over a parking space, Daddy. Why?

175
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,194
It wasn't over a parking space.
They just met at the wrong time.

176
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,488
- What kind of answer is that?
- Just leave it alone.

177
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,949
Let's mind our own business.
He's OK. That's the main thing.

178
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,327
- I can't believe somebody would do this.
- (Knocking)

179
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,914
Who is it?

180
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,250
Police. Is this
the Anello residence?

181
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,962
Yeah. Can I help you?

182
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,673
We're detectives.
We'd like to ask you some questions.

183
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,635
- About what?
- Just open the door!

184
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,768
How you doing? OK, good.

185
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,479
I'm Detective Belsik.
This is my partner, Detective Vella.

186
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,064
Hello, son. How you doing, ma'am?

187
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,901
- We'd like to ask your son a few questions.
- About what?

188
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,945
There was a shooting in front of the building,
and we believe your son was there.

189
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,531
Really? Well, he knows
nothing about that.

190
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,492
Well, we feel he does.
There were people who saw him.

191
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,494
Well, they're wrong.
He don't know nothing.

192
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,456
Listen, Mr Anello. We can do things
the nice way or the hard way, all right?

193
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,792
I don't care what way you do it.
He don't know nothing.

194
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,044
Daddy, I know everything.

195
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,883
Kids. Sometimes they
make believe they see things.

196
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,551
We didn't pick your name out of a hat.

197
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,679
We know your son was down there.
So, come on, let's go.

198
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,226
Son, listen. Here's what
I'd like you to do for us.

199
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,937
I'd like you to take a walk downstairs
with us and your father.

200
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,688
We have people down there.

201
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,567
All I want you to do is pick out
the person you saw with the gun in his hand.

202
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,570
That's it. You think
you could do that for us?

203
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,001
Good. Come on.
Let's take a walk.

204
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,003
Mr. Anello,
take a walk downstairs.

205
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,383
- We won't be long. Go ahead.
- Officer, is he gonna be OK?

206
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,344
Everything's gonna be fine, dear.
They'll be back in two minutes.

207
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,577
There's Lorenzo.

208
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,777
Hey, fellas, turn around.

209
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,365
You two, take your hats off.

210
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,495
Hey! Put your head up.
Straight ahead. Look this way.

211
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,415
- Is that him?
- No.

212
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,342
How about this guy?
Straight ahead, fella.

213
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,969
- How about him?
- No.

214
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,764
Straight ahead, you.

215
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,599
How about this guy?

216
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,685
Give me an answer.

217
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,646
- How about him?
- No.

218
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,277
How about him?
Is it this guy?

219
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,573
Give me an answer.

220
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,664
Hey! Put your eyes up!

221
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,458
How about this guy?

222
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,800
Let's go. Hey, look
straight ahead! Over here.

223
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,221
Look at me. That's it.

224
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,931
Is it this guy?

225
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,143
- How about this guy?
- No.

226
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,478
OK.

227
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,983
Look at this guy.
How about him?

228
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,153
Hey! Straight ahead.

229
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,283
How about this guy?
Is it him?

230
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,384
Give me an answer.

231
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,470
No.

232
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,389
- You satisfied, Officer?
- No, I'm not satisfied.

233
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,267
- He don't know. He can't help you.
- Yeah, yeah, your son doesn't know anything.

234
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,978
- He said no, he can't help you.
- I'll tell you what. Take a walk.

235
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,273
- Go ahead. Go ahead. Take a walk.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

236
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,782
All right, you guys can breathe again.
Beat it. Get out of my sight.

237
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,332
- We really fooled them, Dad.
- Yeah, we fooled them.

238
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,543
I didn't rat, Dad, I didn't rat.

239
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,378
No, you didn't rat.

240
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,089
I did a good thing, right?

241
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,718
Yeah, you did a good thing -
you did a good thing for a bad man.

242
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,930
I did a good thing for a bad man.

243
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,600
I didn't understand that,
not at nine years old.

244
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,353
All I knew was...

245
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,272
a rat was the lowest thing anyone
could be in my neighbourhood...

246
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,690
and I didn't rat.

247
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,876
Daddy, why did you say
I did a good thing for a bad man?

248
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:04,006
Because sometimes in life you gotta do
certain things that you gotta do,

249
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,383
even though they're not right.

250
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,969
Do you understand what I'm saying?

251
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,933
No. It's just that I thought
I did the right thing.

252
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,601
Now I'm not sure I did.

253
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,105
You did do the right thing,
and when you get older, you'll understand why.

254
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,232
Your mother and I
love you very, very much.

255
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,824
Tomorrow you take a ride
on the bus with me. OK?

256
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,831
City Island was the last stop
on my father's route.

257
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,500
It was one of our
favourite places.

258
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,002
It was like going
on a vacation for a day.

259
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,424
My dad would listen to his jazz
and we would talk about baseball.

260
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,847
Dad, can I have an ice cream?

261
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,267
We do our job first,
and then I'll get you an ice cream.

262
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,269
- OK?
- OK, Pop.

263
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,273
Here.

264
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,986
- Let's play the game, Dad.
- OK, let's see how good you are today.

265
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,113
Who was the last player
to win the Triple Crown?

266
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,616
Mickey Mantle.
Batting average, 353.

267
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,952
RBls, 130.

268
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,996
Home runs, 52.

269
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,583
- That's pretty good, son.
- The best ballplayer that ever lived, Dad.

270
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,918
Joe D's the greatest ballplayer.

271
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,463
The Yankee Clipper.

272
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,798
- 56-game hitting streak.
- That's right.

273
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,010
- Nobody beat that. Right, Dad?
- Nobody beat that, son.

274
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,264
- Do you know why Joe D. Was so great?
- Because he was Italian?

275
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,184
- Well, that's part of it.
- Then why?

276
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,269
Because he had
more talent than anybody.

277
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,229
- Talent?
- That's right.

278
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,024
Do I have talent, Dad?

279
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,943
Of course you have talent.
You got all the talent in the world.

280
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,653
Can I be a ballplayer?

281
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,947
You can be anything
you want to be.

282
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,659
Remember, the saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

283
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,620
You could have all the talent in the world,

284
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,039
but if you don't do the right thing,
then nothing happens.

285
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,875
But when you do right,
guess what, good things happen.

286
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,628
- You hear me?
- You're right.

287
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,088
- Let's go for that ice cream.
- Yeah, good.

288
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,384
- I'm gonna shut the doors, right, Dad?
- Yeah.

289
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,640
Ready? Watch it.

290
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,810
- Got it?
- I got it.

291
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,523
Wasted talent.

292
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,776
That was something
my father would talk about all my life.

293
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,112
Come on, let's hurry,
so we can catch the start of the game.

294
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:37,868
'36,683 here to see
the final game of the '60 Series.

295

304
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,158
'And here's the first one
coming to Blanchard.

305
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,827
'Outside and a ball.'

306
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,250
- See you later, Pop.
- OK.

307
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,760
Get right upstairs, and watch the rest
of the game. No hanging out, son.

308
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,896
Hey, Lorenzo, how you doing?

309
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,357
Keep driving.
I want to talk to you.

310
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,738
- Your kid is a good kid.
- Thanks.

311
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,240
Sonny really appreciates
what you and your son did for him.

312
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,201
That's all right.
I'm just glad everything worked out.

313
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,494
He'd like to do something for you.

314
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,705
All you gotta do is
drop some numbers off for us.

315
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,290
You're gonna get $150 a week.

316
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,167
Won't even have to get off the bus.

317
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,004
Tell him I appreciate it, but I got a city job.
If I get pinched I could lose it.

318
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,674
- At least think about it.
- I just can't do it. It's not for me.

319
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,718
$150 a week. You don't
want to think about it?

320
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,763
I can't do this. It's not for me.
I can't do it.

321
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,141
Sonny's gonna be disappointed,
but I'm gonna tell him what you said.

322
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,434
OK.

323
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,978
Stop the bus here.
I want to get off.

324
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,874
- They offered me a job today.
- Doing what?

325
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,292
Numbers.

326
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,920
All I gotta do is pick up a piece of paper
and drop it off on my round

327
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,672
and they said they'll give me
$150 a week.

328
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,882
$150 a week? What did you say?

329
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,803
What do you think I said?
I told him to forget it. It's not for me.

330
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,725
What?

331
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,814
I don't know. $150?
It's only numbers.

332
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,067
- You think I should've took it?
- I don't know.

333
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,736
Yeah, but, come on,
you know...

334
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,490
You get involved with those guys,
next thing, you know, one, two three...

335
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,200
I don't know...

336
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,581
I don't like the way you look.

337
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,876
Maybe you're right.

338
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,047
- I'm going to check on the baby.
- Come here.

339
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,633
- What?
- Come here.

340
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,638
You're not sorry you got stuck
with a bus driver, are you?

341
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,933
- I fell in love with your uniform.
- Yeah.

342
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,237
The day of the funeral,
I felt really bad.

343
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:04,908
I realised that a man had died,
and I had lied and committed a mortal sin.

344
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,660
And I wanted God to forgive me.

345
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,715
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

346
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,676
It has been one month
since my last confession,

347
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,472
and these are my sins:
I missed mass on Sunday twice,

348
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,184
I lied about witnessing a murder once,
I ate meat on Friday once.

349
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,187
Wait a minute. Can you back up
a little bit and say that again?

350
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,773
I ate meat on Friday once?

351
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,275
Not that one.
Back up a little more.

352
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,653
- I lied about witnessing a murder?
- Yeah, that's the one.

353
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,198
Do you realise what you said?

354
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,074
It was only once, Father.

355
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,454
- Do you know what the fifth is?
- Yes, Father, I know what the fifth is.

356
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,790
The fifth is, "I refuse to answer
on the grounds that I might incrimin..."

357
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,374
The Fifth Commandment!

358
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,835
"Thou shall not kill."

359
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:02,549
That's right. Now, I want you to tell me
what happened.

360
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,177
No, Father,
I'm not telling nobody nothing.

361
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,722
Don't be afraid, my son.
Nobody's more powerful than God.

362
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,141
I don't know about that, Father.

363
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,477
Your guy's bigger
than my guy up there,

364
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,771
but my guy's bigger
than your guy down here.

365
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:22,945
You got a point. Five Our Fathers
and five Hail Marys for your penance.

366
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,364
For a murder rap?
That's not bad, Father.

367
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,158
- What did you say?
- Bye, Father!

368
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,245
It was great to be Catholic
and go to confession.

369
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,539
You could start over
every week.

370
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,051
Hey, kid!

371
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:53,433
Come on, Sonny wants to see you.
Nobody's going to grab that bike.

372
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,987
They're good kids.
They just did a piece of work for me.

373
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,989
- Put them in.
- It's up to you, Sonny.

374
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,660
Here's the kid, Sonny.
Go ahead. Don't be afraid.

375
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,007
How you doing, kid?

376
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,467
Good.

377
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,722
We finally meet face-to-face.

378
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,269
Are you afraid of me?

379
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,105
- No.
- That's good.

380
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,566
What's your name?

381
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,360
Calogero.

382
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,530
That's a big name.
You got a nickname or something?

383
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,073
No.

384
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,703
- What do your friends call you?
- Calogero.

385
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,413
That makes sense.

386
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,208
- What are you, a Yankee fan?
- Yeah.

387
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,962
Sit down.

388
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,966
Now, come over here.
Sit over here, next to me.

389
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,635
Come here.

390
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,060
So, you must be pretty upset
after the Yankees lost.

391
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,438
Bill Mazeroski, I hate him.

392
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,690
He made Mickey Mantle cry.

393
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,442
The papers said
that Mick was crying.

394
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,320
Mickey Mantle?
Is that what you're upset about?

395
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,698
Mantle makes $100,000 a year.
How much does your father make?

396
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,908
I don't know.

397
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,119
You don't know? Well, see,
if your father can't pay the rent,

398
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,955
go ask Mickey Mantle,
see what he tells you.

399
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,916
Mickey Mantle don't care about you,
so why should you care about him?

400
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,626
Nobody cares.

401
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,340
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

402
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,426
Did you shoot that man
over a parking space?

403
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,685
When you get older,
you'll understand.

404
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,149
(Calogero) From that day on,

405
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,319
I never felt the same
about the Yankees again.

406
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,967
I started spending a lot
of time with Sonny.

407
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,471
I would come home from school
and sneak away any chance I got.

408
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,142
I would serve the guys drinks and coffee,
and they would give me tips.

409
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,020
- Bet!
- I'll lay a hundred.

410
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,236
Come on, Sonny!

411
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,531
- Son of a bitch!
- I don't believe it!

412
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,324
I should fucking break his arm.

413
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,411
Here, kid, this is for you.

414
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,707
- Sonny, loan me a hundred.
- You know what's gonna happen!

415
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,001
- I feel it! Please!
- Give him a hundred.

416
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,546
- I'm in, I'm in!
- Go ahead. Give him the dice.

417
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,173
- Give him the dice.
- I'm in, I'm in!

418
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,134
- It's fucking hot.
- Come on, Mush, make a donation.

419
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,804
- Come on, Mush, get this over with.
- Come on, dice.

420
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,725
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Come on, seven!

421
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,480
Come on, dice!
And there's a seven!

422
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,689
I don't even have to look.

423
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,901
- Craps! I'm out!
- Get out of here.

424
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:36,448
- Get him out of here!
- Man never hit a number in his life!

425
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,078
- Bring the dice up here.
- Where's the kid?

426
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,332
Sonny, do me a favour,
put this coffee on my tab?

427
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,501
Get the fuck out of here.
Where's the kid?

428
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,629
I'll tell you what.
The kid's gonna throw the dice for me.

429
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,507
Sonny, don't let this kid
throw the dice!

430
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:58,136
- Anybody got a problem with that?
- It's all right. No problem.

431
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,015
I want you to throw the dice for me.

432
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,018
- I don't know how to play dice, Sonny.
- It's OK. You don't have to know.

433
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,729
- You just listen to me. Hear what I said?
- OK.

434
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,565
I'll tell you what.
Put $500 down on the kid.

435
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,400
I got a hundred!

436
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,617
Hey!

437
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,078
Stop fucking
leaning on me, please? Huh?

438
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,122
Come on, you're breathing
all over me, all right?

439
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,706
Hey, JoJo, relax!

440
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm trying to get a bet in.
I wanna play too, you know!

441
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,877
I know you can do it.
You got to hit the wall, kid.

442
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,296
Come on, you can do it.
Hit the wall.

443
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,049
- You can do it.
- Wait, wait, wait...

444
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,343
Wait, wait, wait,
I'm betting on Sonny.

445
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,595
Hey! I don't want your money
touching my money.

446
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,181
- What's the matter, it's counterfeit?
- I don't want your money in the same...

447
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,058
My money's no good no more? Why?

448
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,978
Why? Cos you're a fucking jinx,
that's why!

449
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,397
Put him in the fucking bathroom!

450
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,149
Get him out of here!

451
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:57,070
Fucking get in there,
you fucking loser mutt!

452
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,655
Leave him in there!

453
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,367
- A fucking jinx!
- Shoot the dice.

454
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,412
That's a lot of money on you.
Come on.

455
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,082
- Roll a seven. Come on.
- Shoot the fucking dice. Hit the wall.

456
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,419
Seven!

457
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,675
Bring the dice up.
Put $1,000 on seven.

458
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,311
You can do it, all right?
You can do it. You...

459
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,647
Giorgio, stop fucking breathing on me!
You're killing me over here!

460
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,650
I'm on a win streak.
Stop breathing on me!

461
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,653
- Bobby, put him in the bathroom.
- Sonny, Eddie's in there. He ain't gonna fit.

462
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,739
I don't give a fuck!
Put him in!

463
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,710
Give me a another seven.

464
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,463
Shoot the fucking dice!
Come on!

465
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,384
We got a four! That's all right.

466
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,969
Four's what we got.

467
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,848
- Let's go! Shoot the dice!
- Give the kid another shot!

468
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,517
What's wrong with this money?
What, is he crazy?

469
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,852
What is it, counterfeit?

470
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,357
I say the kid makes the four.
Give me $500.

471
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,816
$500 more. Get your bets down.

472
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:21,154
- Twenty-two on the hard four.
- I'll lay a hundred.

473
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,199
- Who wants a gag on the four?
- One-forty, no gag.

474
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,659
One-forty, no gag. Put it down.

475
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,870
- I say the kid makes the hard four.
- He'll never make the hard four, never.

476
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,997
Come on. You can do it.

477
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,209
- Don't worry, Sonny. I'll throw a seven.
- No, no seven!

478
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,212
- Yeah! Hit a seven!
- Shut up! He ain't gonna throw no seven.

479
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,755
Do you believe this kid?

480
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,008
Hey, I don't want anybody
laughing at this kid, all right?

481
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,802
Come on, no seven.
Sevens are not good now.

482
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,845
- Hit the wall.
- Get a four. You can do it.

483
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,139
You gotta make the point.
You can do it.

484
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,391
No, no, no...

485
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,769
Frankie Coffeecake, no good.

486
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,647
I don't want his face looking
at that face when he's throwing my dice.

487
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,484
No, no, no. Jimmy, get a towel
from the bar. Put it over his head.

488
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,362
Come on, Sonny. I don't want a towel
over my head. It's embarrassing.

489
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,864
Put him in the fucking bathroom.
Get him out of here.

490
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,492
Wait a minute. I got money here!

491
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,370
Get the fuck out of here!

492
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,998
- Get him the fuck out!
- Put him in the bathroom.

493
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,165
Get over here.

494
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:20,380
- Rat bastard locked us in the bathroom.
- It's degrading. Very degrading.

495
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,382
Come on, I need that point.
Listen to me!

496
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,884
Listen to me.
See that money over there? Look.

497
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,387
See that money?
Are we going to make this point?

498
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,306
Come on. We're gonna
make this point. Attaboy!

499
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,059
- Come on!
- I need a 2-2 on the hard four.

500
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,562
Hey, don't get cocky, kid!

501
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,980
- Just make the point.
- Fucking kid.

502
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,524
Just make the point. Go ahead.
Come on.

503
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,112
I don't fucking believe it!
He did it!

504
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,907
Eleven. I made eleven
passes in a row.

505
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,788
I don't know how much money
Sonny won, but it was a lot.

506
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,588
He would always say
the working man was a sucker,

507
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,590
and I was going
to the best school in the world,

508
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,216
the University of Belmont Ave,

509
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,968
and I was getting two educations:

510
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,346
One from the street
and one from school.

511
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,931
That way I'd be twice as smart
as everybody.

512
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,697
Hey, kid.

513
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,158
- You did good.
- Thanks.

514
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,993
Here.

515
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,662
That's it?

516
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,791
Here.

517
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,169
All right?

518
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,131
- Go home. It's getting late.
- See you later, Sonny.

519
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,470
Listen.

520
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,974
We gotta do something
about your name.

521
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,269
From now on,
your name is C.

522
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,605
- C?
- That's right. C.

523
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,315
Go home. Go ahead.

524
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,025
So long, Sonny.

525
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,530
Sonny took me everywhere and he
would always introduce me as his boy.

526
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,366
And I noticed that strange things started
happening in the neighbourhood.

527
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,620
Hey, Calogero, come on over.
I want to talk to you.

528
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,041
My name is C.

529
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,668
I mean C.

530
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:26,089
- How are you today, my boy?
- Good.

531
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,633
I got some nice peaches
for your mum.

532
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,844
I don't have
any money on me, Phil.

533
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,222
You don't need no money
with me, kid.

534
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,434
Don't embarrass me
like that again.

535
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,688
Just tell Sonny
that I took care of you.

536
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,481
OK.

537
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,319
That's when it hit me.

538
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,240
It was because of Sonny
that everyone was treating me so nice.

539
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:55,702
I liked it.
I liked it a lot.

540
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,585
Mummy, mummy, look what I got.
Some peaches for...

541
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,336
free.

542
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,807
- What's this?
- What's what, Dad?

543
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,350
Where did you get this?

544
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,186
Your mother found this
behind your drawer.

545
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,396
It's the money
that I've been saving, Dad.

546
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,064
$600 you've been saving?

547
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,484
What, you've become
a brain surgeon overnight, son?

548
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,235
Tell your father
where you got the money.

549
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,778
Dad, I worked for it.

550
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,406
- Doing what?
- Things.

551
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,617
"Things"? What do you mean, "things"?
What "things"?

552
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,661
- Oh, things. You know, things.
- Hey!

553
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:42,123
Don't lie to me. Just tell me the truth,
and I won't get upset.

554
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,875
Promise?

555
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,086
I'm your father.
Would I say it if I didn't mean it?

556
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,715
I work the crap games,
and the guys gave me tips.

557
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,551
- Crap games?
- What crap games?

558
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,179
What crap games?
What tips?

559
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,516
- What crap games?
- I thought you weren't gonna get upset, Dad.

560
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,934
I lied. Now, tell me everything.

561
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,270
- I work for Sonny, and he gave me tips.
- I knew it.

562
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,815
Weren't you told a dozen times
not to go near that bar?

563
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,901
- But Ma, I worked for it.
- Whaddya mean, you worked for it?

564
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,237
- You're not supposed to be in that bar!
- I'm taking this money back.

565
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,198
- I'm bringing it right back down to the bar.
- Let's just think about this for a minute.

566
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,201
- What do you mean, "think about it"?
- We could use the money.

567
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,994
It's not like
he had to do something bad.

568
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,664
That's not the point.
You know where this money comes from.

569
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,083
I don't want him
to have that kind of money!

570
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,709
- Let's just think about this.
- That's it!

571
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,170
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.

572
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:35,218
Lorenzo, why do you got
to go down like this? Calm down!

573
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,096
Lorenzo, please!

574
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,722
I don't believe this!

575
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,536
- Is Sonny around?
- Yeah, I think he's in the back.

576
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,048
We can't accept that.

577
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,051
I gave it to your son.
He worked for it.

578
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,179
That's right. My son and I don't want
my son involved in what goes on here.

579
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,140
Involved in what?
What are you talking about?

580
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,184
Please, I'm not a stupid man, OK?
Please. I'm not stupid.

581
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,854
You know what I'm talking about.
Just stay away from my son, OK?

582
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,522
Hey, you stay right over here.

583
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,858
C, why don't you go outside.
I wanna talk to your father.

584
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,361
I'll speak to my own son.
Calogero, wait outside.

585
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,366
First of all, I respect you, Lorenzo.
You're a stand-up guy.

586
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,202
We're from the same neighbourhood,
but don't ever talk to me like that again.

587
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,039
I tell your son to go to school,
to go to college...

588
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,041
It's not what you say,
it's what he sees.

589
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,377
It's the clothes, it's the cars,
it's the money, it's everything.

590
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,463
He tried to throw away
his baseball cards the other day

591
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,007
because Mickey Mantle
would never pay my rent.

592
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,635
He said that to you?
I don't believe this kid.

593
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:03,014
It's not funny when your nine-year-old kid
has a bigger bank account than you do.

594
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,224
I offered you a job,
but you said no to me.

595
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,645
That's right. And I say no now.
Just leave my son alone. Please.

596
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,357
Don't you see how I treat that kid?
I treat him like he's my son.

597
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,652
- He ain't your son. He's my son!
- He's what?

598
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,779
- Get the fuck out of here!
- I'm not afraid of you.

599
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,365
- You should be.
- I know what you're capable of.

600
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,534
And I would never step out of line.
You can ask anybody who knows me.

601
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,996
But this time you're wrong.
This is my son, not yours!

602
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,956
- Are you gonna fight me?
- Stay away from my son!

603
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,875
Get out of here
before I give you a fucking slap!

604
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,544
Just stay away from my son!

605
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,589
I don't care who you are,
you stay away from my son.

606
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,424
- Where's my money, Dad?
- I left it in there.

607
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,010
What? How could you do that, Dad?
It was my money!

608
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,721
That's bad money!
I don't want you to have that money.

609
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,808
- Dad, I earned that money!
- I said I want you to stay away from him!

610
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,394
- Dad, please listen to me!
- I said you stay away from him!

611
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,064
- Dad, listen to me!
- Did you hear what I said? Stay away!

612
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,068
Sonny was right.
The working man is a sucker.

613
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,612
He's wrong! It don't
take much strength to pull a trigger,

614
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,365
but try and get up every morning
and work for a living!

615
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,243
Let's see him try that!
Then we'll see who's the real tough guy.

616
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,786
The working man is the tough guy.

617
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,163
Your father's the tough guy!

618
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,166
Everybody loves him, just like
everybody loves you on the bus.

619
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,878
It's not the same. People don't love him.
They fear him.

620
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,131
There's a difference.

621
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,135
- I'm sorry I hit you.
- I don't understand, Dad.

622
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,347
You will.
You will when you get older.

623
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,642
I'm sorry I hit you.

624
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,670
- You want me to take care of him?
- No, leave him alone.

625
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,884
Sonny and my father never
spoke to each other again.

626
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,304
And I never listened to my father
about staying away from him.

627
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,224
The bar was so close,
and I would sneak away any chance I got.

628
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,854
Eight years passed, and as I grew,
Sonny grew in power.

629
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,149
He became a boss,
and I was his friend.

630
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,291
It was now 1968.

631
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,418
Dion was on top of the charts.

632
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,754
The Beatles were changing
the way we lived.

633
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,174
The Yankees were in last place
and I didn't give a shit.

634
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,428
There was change everywhere,
but my neighbourhood was still the same.

638
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,770
Here comes the kid!
We didn't get shut out.

639
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,565
- C, come here! You get it in?
- Yeah, I got it in. It's all on Kryptonite.

640
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,528
- You hold them.
- Look at this horse go.

641
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,822
- Come on. Take it home!
- Look at this one move!

642
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,034
- This horse can't lose!
- You can do it, Kryptonite! Come on!

643
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,871
Look, it's a lock. It's beautiful.
Don't even worry about it. We can't lose.

644
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,123
I'm not even going to look
because I know we can't lose.

645
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,959
- We can't lose.
- Let's go. Come on!

646
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,337
- Look! He's pulling away!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

647
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,673
Come on, Kryptonite!
Look at him!

648
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,175
Forget it. It's over.
It's all over.

649
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,802
- Damn.
- Let's go!

650
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,305
- That's it, Kryptonite!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

651
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,725
Bring me luck!
Come on. Bring me luck!

652
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,937
Come on, Kryptonite!
Hang in there! Come on!

653
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,772
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Let's go!

654
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,942
Get the...
He bet the fucking horse?

655
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,653
He bet Kryptonite?
Give me the tickets.

656
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,280
But, Sonny, we're winning.

657
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,825
We can't win. The Mush bet Kryptonite.
Fucking jinx!

658
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,663
- We're five lengths in the lead.
- Come on. We've been "mushed."

659
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,209
Come on. I got to get away
from this fucking jinx.

660
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,005
Come on. You can still do it!

661
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,091
Come on, Kryptonite.
You can still do it!

662
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,137
- Hang in there!
- Come on. Take it home!

663
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,556
Hang in there!

664
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,934
No! Shit!

665
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:22,607
- Fuck! This fucking close!
- I don't believe I lost!

666
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,526
- I don't fucking believe it!
- Hey, C!

667
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,695
I got a tip in the next race for you.

668
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,072
Go fuck yourself!

669
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,700
You're very emotional.

670
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,623
(Commentator) 'White Birch
wins it in an absolute shocker! '

671
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,346
We finally got
our own social club.

672
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,306
We called it Deuces Wild.

673
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,101
Drinks were a buck and the jukebox
and the cigarette machine paid the rent.

674
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,937
All we cared about
was hanging out.

675
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,941
We would cut class
and hang out all day and all night.

676
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,817
Nobody wanted to go home,

677
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,986
because God forbid,
you were the first one to go home

678
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,739
and then found out the next day
that you missed something.

679
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,411
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
fellas, whoa!

680
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,206
Look at those broads over there.
They're beautiful!

681
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,417
Look at those broads.
They're beautiful!

682
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,804
Yo, get over here!
Come here!

683
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,431
Put it back in your pants.

684
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,351
- Those fucking broads are both pigs.
- How the hell do you know?

685
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,396
- Fuck you, C.
- How the hell do you know?

686
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,189
They'd fail my test in a second.

687
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,608
- What test are we talking about?
- It has a name or something?

688
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,069
If you wanna know if you can trust a girl
and she is good enough to marry,

689
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,654
she's got to pass the test.

690
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,616
- I call it the Mario test.
- This I got to hear. What's this test?

691
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:59,704
The test is, you take a girl like that
for a ride in your car, right?

692
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,583
Jump on the highway, you pull up
to one of them big 18-wheelers.

693
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,503
You pull right alongside of it
and get attention of the driver.

694
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:11,340
Honk your horn. Do what you gotta do.
Make sure he's looking. That's important.

695
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,427
At the same time, put your hand
behind this fucking broad's head,

696
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,221
and you start pushing her head down
between your legs.

697
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,100
- Get the fuck out of here.
- It's for her own good, believe me.

698
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,353
Now, if this girl
goes down on you,

699
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,689
knowing that that guy in the truck
is watching,

700
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,191
- then she's a pig, and can't be trusted.
- It's not gonna work.

701
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,944
You're a sick maniac.
You need some help.

702
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,321
When they're into it,
they do stuff with their hand,

703
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,741
they throw their hair over their ear.
They did it before.

704
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,826
Believe me,
they're fucking pros.

705
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,845
That's the second time
those niggers passed today.

706
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,473
As long as they don't stop,
who gives a fuck?

707
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,725
I give a fuck, that's who.

708
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,394
Did they get out to bother you?
No, they didn't bother you.

709
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,105
Today it's one car, next week it's two,
before you know it

710
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,566
it's their neighbourhood
and they're fucking our broads.

711
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,485
They shouldn't come through here.
Period.

712
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,196
Invite them in.
Make them have a drink.

713
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,323
Baseball-bat their fucking heads.

714
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,451
Hey, you want a shot?
Take one. Come back!

715
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,332
Louie? Dumps! Get over here!
Where's my money?

716
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,876
I got to do that thing.
I can't...

717
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,419
- Shit!
- What's up?

718
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,214
This guy owes me 20 bucks.
It's been two fucking weeks now.

719
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,925
You can't dodge me forever!

720
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,094
Fucking piece of shit.

721
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,647
I gotta talk to my father.
I'll be right back, all right?

722
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,818
- All right, I'll see you.
- Come back.

723
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,617
Come on. Take a ride with me.
I got one trip left.

724
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,537
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, you have to. Come on.

725
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,838
Sit. Sit over here.

726
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,349
Dad, do we have to listen to this music?
It gives me a headache.

727
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,602
You kids today, I gotta tell you,
you don't even know what good music is.

728
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,271
Listen to this. This is good music.

729
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,739
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow night?

730
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:46,579
Calogero?

731
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,415
Hey! You listening to me?

732
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,084
Calogero! Hey!

733
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,087
Dad, why can't you call me C?
Everybody calls me C.

734
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,882
Because that was your grandfather's
name, and that's the name I gave you.

735
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,885
That's why I can't call you C
or whatever you want to call yourself.

736
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,223
Want to go to the fights
tomorrow night?

737
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:11,395
- Could I let you know tomorrow?
- You wanna go or you don't wanna go?

738
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,482
- All right, all right, I'll go.
- Don't say it like that.

739
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:19,069
Don't wanna be twisting your arm,
but you know...

740
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,137
She was tall,
she was beautiful,

741
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,014
and she was classy.

742
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,267
But she was black.

743
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,730
And that was a no-no
in my neighbourhood.

744
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,253
- Jackie, what's the first?
- 2:00, fellas.

745
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,172
- Two. Your friend's number.
- Who?

746
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,842
- Your pal.
- Don't fuck around.

747
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,177
- Johnny Biscord bet 228 again?
- That's it.

748
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,554
- Again?
- Again.

749
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:12,725
I'll try to have some better music
for you next time.

750
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,394
I'm only kidding.
It's OK, Pop.

751
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,358
See you later.

752
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,673
- Louie!
- My grandmother's sick.

753
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,051
I'll talk to you later.

754
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,553
- I got to go do something.
- Where's my fucking money?

755
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,516
You're fucking dead when I catch you,
you piece of shit!

756
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,852
C, come here!

757
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,396
- Get over here.
- He's fucking crazy, this kid.

758
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,733
The kid wants his fucking money.
What can you do?

759
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,570
- I got to talk to him.
- You gotta stop babying him.

760
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,573
He owes me money.

761
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,202
- Hit him with a fucking bat.
- Knock him all over the fucking block.

762
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:17,039
Is that the advice you give the kid,
you fucking hoodlums?

763
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,667
Come on. Don't listen
to these hoodlums.

764
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,754
I'm gonna go to Gino's.
I'll be right back.

765
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,465
What's the matter?

766
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,009
This guy Louie Dumps over here,
he owes me 20 dollars.

767
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:33,347
It's been two weeks now, and every time
he sees me he keeps dodging me.

768
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,892
He's becoming a real pain in the ass.
Should I crack him one, or what?

769
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,812
What's the matter?
What have I been telling you?

770
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,689
Sometimes hurting somebody
ain't the answer.

771
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,818
- First of all, is he a good friend of yours?
- No, I don't even like him.

772
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,946
You don't even like him.
There's your answer right there.

773
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,199
Look at it this way:
It costs you 20 dollars to get rid of him.

774
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:56,036
He's never bother you again.
He's never gonna ask you for money again.

775
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,997
He's out of your life for 20 dollars.
You got off cheap. Forget him.

776
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,501
- You're always right. You're always right.
- Yeah, I'm always right.

777
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,421
If I was always right, I wouldn't have done
10 years in the joint.

778
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,548
What did you do every day?

779
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,134
There's only three things
you can do in the joint, kid:

780
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,636
Lift weights, play cards
or get into trouble.

781
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,305
- What did you do?
- Me? I read.

782
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,475
What did you read?

783
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,519
- Ever hear of Machiavelli?
- Who?

784
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:24,481
Machiavelli. He's a famous writer
from 500 years ago.

785
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,900
Availability.
That's what he always said.

786
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,903
- Availability?
- That's right. Listen to me.

787
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,407
You know why I live
in this neighbourhood?

788
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,367
Availability.

789
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,911
I want to stay close
to everything,

790
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,789
because being on the spot,
I can see trouble immediately.

791
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,959
Trouble is like a cancer.
You got to get it early.

792
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,378
If you don't get it early,
it gets too big, and it kills you.

793
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,297
That's why you got to cut it out.

794
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,923
Capish?

795
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:56,013
You're worried about Louie Dumps.
Nobody cares!

796
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:01,351
Worry about yourself, your family,
the people that are important to you.

797
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,229
That's what it comes down to:
Availability.

798
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,358
The people that see me every day
that are on my side,

799
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,028
they feel safe
because they know I'm close.

800
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,864
That gives them
more reason to love me.

801
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,826
But the people that want to do otherwise,
they think twice,

802
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,953
because they know I'm close.

803
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,872
That gives them
more reason to fear me.

804
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,291
Is it better
to be loved or feared?

805
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,961
That's a good question.

806
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,547
It's nice to be both,
but it's very difficult.

807
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,883
But if I had my choice...

808
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,843
I would rather be feared.

809
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,472
Fear lasts longer than love.

810
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,933
Friendships that are bought with money
mean nothing.

811
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,061
You see how it is around here.
I make a joke, everybody laughs.

812
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,021
I know I'm funny,
but I'm not that funny.

813
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:51,276
It's fear that keeps them loyal to me,
but the trick is not being hated.

814
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,904
That's why I treat my men good,
but not too good.

815
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,406
I give too much,
then they don't need me.

816
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,493
I give just enough where they need me,
but they don't hate me.

817
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,163
Don't forget what I'm telling you.

818
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,377
Sonny, I got some
beautiful veal chops today.

819
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,046
I got some nice linguine frutti di mare

820
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,383
and I got some beautiful Pescatore sauce.

821
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,303
Fellas, you're not dressed properly.
You're gonna have to leave.

822
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,555
Properly? What's wrong
with how we're dressed?

823
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,850
These gentlemen ain't dressed right.
I asked them to leave.

824
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,685
Is there a problem?

825
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,729
Your man there says
we're not properly dressed.

826
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,064
Like our money ain't green.
We just want a couple of beers.

827
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,066
Two beers, that's it?

828
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,445
That's it. We'll be on our way.
We ain't looking for trouble.

829
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,448
Spoken like a gentleman.
Give them their beers.

830
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,949
- I appreciate that.
- No problem.

831
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,331
Here you go.

832
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,791
You got some brews down here?
Nice cold ones.

833
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,376
Get us some nice cold brews.
Come on.

834
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,087
Two over here, huh?

835
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:40,802
One more beer.
Got some thirsty people here.

836
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:45,349
All right, brothers.
If I may, a toast to our host.

837
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,810
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost!

838
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,937
Get wet, you dago wop!

839
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,149
(Shouting and jeering)

840
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,069
Hey!

841
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,071
Oh, you again, huh?

842
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,698
That wasn't very nice.
Now yous gotta to leave.

843
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,701
I'll tell you when the fuck we leave.
Get the fuck away from me.

844
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,495
(Laughing)

845
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,458
Go watch the bikes, man.

846
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:15,128
- What's going on here?
- Come on!

847
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:21,301
- Hey, get outta here!
- What's this shit?

848
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,804
What's going on here?

849
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,392
Now yous can't leave.

850
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,937
(Calogero) I will never forget
the look on their faces.

851
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:36,066
All eight of them.
Their faces dropped.

852
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:40,612
All their courage and strength
was drained from their bodies.

853
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:43,824
They had a reputation
for breaking up bars.

854
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,035
But they knew that instant
they made a fatal mistake.

855
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,870
This time, they walked
into the wrong bar.

856
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,248
Come on, motherfucker!

857
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,012
(♪ Jukebox scratches and stops)

858
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,937
Crack his fucking head open!

859
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,167
You fucking creep!

860
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,546
Come here, you cocksucker!

861
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,934
Step on his fucking head!

862
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,190
Come on, get them out of here!

863
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,692
Drag them the fuck out!
Come on, move it!

864
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,411
Watch my car!

865
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,337
Yeah, you fucking bums!

866
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,174
Get him!
Grab that hairy bastard!

867
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,592
Let the kids kill them.

868
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:28,094
- For God's sake.
- Hit him with the bat!

869
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,387
Get him!

870
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,184
Kick him in his face!

871
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,685
Here, you motherfucker!

872
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,313
Look at me.

873
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:41,650
I'm the one who did this to you.
Remember me.

874
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:46,988
Come on, Sonny!
Come on, let's go, you guys!

875
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:52,744
- They ruined my lunch!
- Let's get the fuck out, Sonny!

876
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,749
Leave them there
like the bums that they are.

877
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,297
They ruined my whole fucking lunch!
Come on!

878
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,315
Take a look at this gun
right here.

879
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,067
It's a.45.

880
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:28,071
This thing could stop an elephant
driving a truck and the truck too!

881
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,407
(Calogero) Nicky Zero was
the neighbourhood thief.

882
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,451
His mother called him Zero, cos she
said he'd never amount to nothing.

883
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,579
It's too big.
Where are you gonna hide it?

884
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,707
- Then you want this one.
- They can spot that a mile away.

885
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,794
- You need this.
- Whoa! What is wrong with you?

886
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,590
- Don't point the gun.
- It's on safety. I'm not gonna kill you.

887
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,093
Don't ever do that.
Now let me see the fucking gun.

888
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:54,014
- This is you. This is class.
- I don't know.

889
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,058
- What's this?
- Let me see this one.

890
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,187
- This one's nice.
- Right there. Feel it.

891
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,982
I'm gonna fucking shoot somebody,
know what I mean?

892
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,235
I wanna shoot somebody too.
That looks like just the gun to do it.

893
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:10,989
What are you guys doing, huh?
What's going on here?

894
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:16,286
Are you fucking stupid or something?

895
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,456
What's the matter with you, selling guns
around here? Are you fucking stupid?

896
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,791
You'll make this whole place hot
and get us all fucking pinched.

897
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,669
Now get the fuck outta here!

898
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:28,256
Stay over here. Don't move.
All of you. Stay right there.

899
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:31,509
I want no fucking guns. You hear me?
Get out of here!

900
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,845
C, get over here, you!

901
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:37,015
Come here. I wanna talk to you.
Get over here.

902
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,816
- Sonny, loan me 500.
- Tomorrow, tomorrow!

903
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,576
You think you're a tough guy
with these guns, is that what it is?

904
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,037
No, but after what happened
in the bar, I thought...

905
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:01,748
You thought what? You think a gun
makes you a tough guy?

906
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:05,543
Let me tell you, I seen more guys
with guns wet the bed than anything.

907
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,921
It's when the other guy
pulls out his gun,

908
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,798
then we see who the real tough guy is.

909
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,550
- Sonny, you don't understand.
- No, I do understand.

910
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,387
This shit is not for you. Those kids
are gonna get you in trouble.

911
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:19,516
- But they're my friends, you know that.
- They're jerk-offs.

912
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,476
Look at me.

913
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:25,647
Jerk-offs.
And Slick is the biggest jerk-off.

914
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,274
All these years,
what have I been telling you?

915
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,319
I know, "Stay in school.
Get two educations." I know.

916
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:34,197
That's right. Don't do what I do.

917
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:37,033
This is my life, not yours.

918
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,620
I do what I have to do.
This is not for you.

919
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,622
All right. I'm sorry.

920
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,212
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

921
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,797
I don't know.

922
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,383
I got a piece of a good middleweight.

923
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,468
You come with me, we'll sit in front.

924
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:59,305
I'd like to come,
but I told my father I'd go with him.

925
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,142
You know where I'm sitting,
come by and say hello.

926
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,061
- All right.
- You know where I'm sitting.

927
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,281
Sit here.

928
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,869
Nice seats. I gotta be careful
I don't get a nosebleed.

929
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,621
These are the best I can do.
What do you want from me?

930
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:26,166
Come on, Pop, I'm only kidding.

931
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,239
Hi, C. How are you doing?
Hello, Lorenzo.

932
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,657
How are you doing?

933
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:04,287
Sonny has a couple of ringside
seats for you. Why not come down?

934
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,790
Well, erm...

935
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,919
Tell him thanks,
but we're good where we are.

936
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,796
OK.

937
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:17,383
Tell Sonny thanks anyway,
but we're good where we are.

938
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,804
You're welcome to come down.
You know where the seats are.

939
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,139
Anytime during the fight, OK?

940
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,100
OK. Thanks.

01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:52,377
You think I want to sit with you
when you wanna be with them?

948
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,631
How do you think
that makes me feel?

956
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,968
- Do you like him?
- He's a fucking jerk-off!

957
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:44,554
Ten dollars. You got off cheap.
He's out of your life.

I'm still gonna fucking break his face...

There she was, right in front of me.

I saw her on my father's bus.

01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,891
- Yeah.
- Got it.

1049
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:26,103
- My friends call me C.
- Well, I like Calogero better.

1050
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:32,235
These books are heavy.

1051
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,820
That's why I'm glad
you're carrying them.

1052
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,063
Well...

1053
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,066
I guess this is it.

1054
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,902
- I really had a great time.
- Me too.

1055
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,073
- I think you're very nice.
- Thanks. So are you.

1056
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,866
Thank you.

1057
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,206
Sorry I can't walk you
all the way home.

1058
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:31,502
Oh, that's all right.
I only live a block down.

1059
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:35,006
- So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

1060
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,341
Tomorrow night? 6:00?

1061
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:39,719
You're getting better.

1062
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,679
I just wanted to double-check.

1063
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,433
Well. Bye.

1064
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,018
Bye.

1065
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,391
What is it, white motherfucker?

1066
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,029
Cinque! Sette!

1067
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:41,697
- Come on, Aldo.
- Sette!

1068
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,282
(Jeering)

1069
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,995
That was a late fucking finger.
That was late.

1070
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:52,333
- Was it late, Mario? Tell me.
- What are you talking about?

1071
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:55,336
This fucking kid keeps
winning my money!

1072
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,881
I'll give him the malocchio.
He ain't gonna win no more...

1073
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,842
He's got all my money.
How am I gonna play?

1074
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:03,427
I don't know...

1075
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:09,600
What the fuck, man?

1076
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,644
What the fuck?

1077
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,397
These fucking spooks can't ride
in their own neighbourhood?

1078
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:15,940
Just leave them alone.

1079
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,401
What is it with you
and these niggers lately?

1080
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,112
- They ain't bothering nobody.
- They're fucking bothering me.

1081
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,781
They ain't bothering me.

1082
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,123
This is our fucking neighbourhood,
you black bastard!

1083
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,837
Let's go get these fucking niggers!
Come on!

1084
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,005
Get the fuck
out of our neighbourhood!

1085
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,342
- Let's get out of here!
- Get off!

1086
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,804
Motherfucker, get the fuck outta here!

1087
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,932
Black bastard!

1088
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,774
C, come here!

1089
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,529
Leave me alone!

1090
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:07,324
Hey, grab him, C!
Get this motherfucker!

1091
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:11,787
Stay down! I'm not gonna hurt you.
Stay down. I don't wanna hurt you.

1092
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,206
Get him! Get him down!

1093
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,172
Motherfucker!

1094
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:24,383
C, what are you doing,
dancing with him? Get off!

1095
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:29,472
Get out of here, you crazy bastards.
The cops are coming, run!

1096
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,515
I can see them. Go! Go!

1097
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:34,143
- I can see the lights.
- Get off him!

1098
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,104
They called the cops! Come one!
Let's go!

1099
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,814
They called the cops!

1100
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,983
What the fuck you doing, man?

1101
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:44,320
- You're gonna kill him!
- I don't care. I want to kill him!

1102
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:47,323
- The fucking cops are coming!
- Fuck that!

1103
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:51,285
The cops are coming!
They called the fucking cops! Come on!

1104
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,881
Didn't I tell you
Slick was nothing but trouble?

1105
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:06,425
Yeah, but he's my friend, I just...

1106
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:10,471
He's your friend.
I'm your friend, kid.

1107
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,765
You're letting yourself
get caught up in his shit.

1108
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:16,060
These kids could hurt you.
You gotta think for yourself.

1109
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,980
I do, I'm really trying,
but we hate these people.

1110
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,774
I don't hate them, but you know...

1111
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,610
What people?
What's on your mind?

1112
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:27,571
- I met this girl.
- Yeah? So?

1113
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:32,576
I like her and everything, but she ain't
white, she's from Webster Avenue.

1114
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:35,412
- She's a coloured broad.
- Yeah.

1115
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:38,999
- You like this girl?
- I do, but I don't wanna hear the guys...

1116
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:43,045
Fuck those kids. Half of them
are gonna end up dead or in jail.

1117
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,047
Nobody cares.

1118
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:49,677
Only that matters is what's good for you
and how you feel about each other.

1119
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:53,055
Let me tell you something.

1120
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:56,600
When you're alone, late at night in bed,
just you and her under the covers,

1121
01:20:56,726 --> 01:20:58,602
that's all that matters, see?

1122
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:01,522
You gotta do
what your heart tells you to do.

1123
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,607
I'll tell you something right now.

1124
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:06,694
You're only allowed three
great women in your lifetime.

1125
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,905
They come along like great fighters,
once every ten years.

1126
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:13,450
Rocky Marciano,
Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Louis.

1127
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:16,245
Sometimes you get them all at once.

1128
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:22,167
Me? I had my three when I was 16.
That happens. What are you gonna do?

1129
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:26,964
That's the way it goes, you know?
I tell you right now. See this girl?

1130
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:31,552
Maybe this girl puts wind
in your sails.

1131
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:37,057
- Maybe she's your first great one.
- Thanks, Sonny. I think I'll go for it.

1132
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:41,061
- Is she a good kid?
- I just met her, but I hope so.

1133
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:43,314
Here's what you do.
Tomorrow you borrow my car.

1134
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,774
- You don't lend anybody your car.
- I'll lend you my car.

1135
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,651
I want you to make
a good impression.

1136
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:50,279
You borrow my car,
then you give her the test.

1137
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,114
What, the Mario test?

1138
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,117
Mario's a fucking psycho.
Why do you listen to this kid?

1139
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,494
Give her my test, the door test.

1140
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:59,788
- What's the door test?
- Listen to me.

1141
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,499
You pull up right where she is, right?

1142
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:05,586
Before you get out of the car,
you lock both doors.

1143
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:08,297
You get out of the car,
you walk over to her.

1144
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,299
You bring her over to the car.

1145
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:13,594
You take out the key, put it in the lock,
open the door for her.

1146
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,388
Then you let her get in.
Then you close the door for her.

1147
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:19,683
You walk around the back of the car
and look through the rear window.

1148
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:22,102
If she doesn't reach over
and lift up that button

1149
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:24,313
so you can get in,
dump her.

1150
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,607
- Just like that?
- Listen to me, kid.

1151
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:30,194
If she doesn't reach over, lift up
that button for you so you can get in,

1152
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,447
she's a selfish broad and all you're
seeing is the tip of the iceberg.

1153
01:22:33,573 --> 01:22:35,783
Dump her and dump her fast.

1154
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:37,701
What about the beautiful things
you just told me?

1155
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:39,912
Do what my heart tells me to do.

1156
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,415
Find someone to put wind
in my sails. She could be a great one.

1157
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,834
Bullshit, kid.
The door test, that's what counts.

1158
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,087
You dump her,
and you dump her fast.

1159
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,339
- Dump her?
- Dump her.

1160
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,635
Dump her?

1161
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:06,105
- Dad. Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

1162
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:11,110
I need your opinion. You know
Joey Osso from down the block?

1163
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,486
Yeah.

1164
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:14,989
He asked me what I thought about
him going out with a coloured girl.

1165
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:18,367
- What do you think about that?
- Joey can't find any white girls?

1166
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,370
That's not a good answer, Dad.
What's the problem?

1167
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,372
I get along with everybody
on the bus,

1168
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:27,042
but when it comes to marriage,
we should marry within our own.

1169
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:31,088
- You know I'm not prejudiced...
- Don't tell me that, cos you are.

1170
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:34,008
What would you say if I wanted
to go out with a coloured girl?

1171
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,884
You would never do that.

1172
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,262
You never know. This girl
might be one of the great ones.

1173
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:41,807
You're only allowed three great women
in your lifetime, know what I'm saying?

1174
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:45,602
- Who told you that?
- Joey Osso.

1175
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,522
- Joey Osso?
- Hmm.

1176
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:52,651
You tell Joey Osso that
sometimes in the heat of passion,

1177
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:54,820
the little head tells
the big head what to do,

1178
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:57,865
and that the big head
should think twice about it.

1179
01:23:57,991 --> 01:23:59,992
All right.

1180
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,077
Be careful.

1181
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,545
- You OK?
- No.

1182
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:37,005
My brother got beat up
in your neighbourhood.

1183
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,340
What are you talking about?

1184
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:42,177
Yesterday, some Italian guys beat up
my brother in your neighbourhood.

1185
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:45,514
- What's that have to do with me?
- Were you there?

1186
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,393
- No, I wasn't there.
- Calogero, please don't lie to me.

1187
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:51,520
Jane, I'm telling you the truth.
I wasn't there.

1188
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,731
We'll see who's lying.
My brother's in the car.

1189
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:58,152
I told him I was going out
with an Italian, so he came along.

1190
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,779
He recognized you
and said you beat him up.

1191
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:03,907
- You did that to his face.
- I didn't touch your brother.

1192
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:07,369
- Believe me, I didn't touch him.
- OK, we'll see.

1193
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,037
Willy!

1194
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,713
We'll get this straight right now.

1195
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:29,808
Yeah, that's him. That's him.

1196
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:31,852
You did this to me, man.

1197
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:33,562
- I didn't do anything...
- Yes, you did!

1198
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,689
- Are you sure it was him?
- I'm positive!

1199
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:38,233
Please don't believe him.
I didn't touch him.

1200
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,819
- So you were there?
- But I didn't do anything, Jane.

1201
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:44,489
- Believe me...
- You told me you weren't there!

1202
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,617
It was the other guys.
I tried to help him.

1203
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:49,661
- How did my eye get like this?
- I tried to fucking help you!

1204
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:52,497
- Bullshit, man!
- You know I didn't do anything.

1205
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:54,917
- Why were you on top of me?
- It was the others!

1206
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,003
- It was you!
- I was the only guy helping you.

1207
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:01,924
- And you fucking repay me like this?
- Fuck that! No, fuck you, man!

1208
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,342
I didn't do anything!

1209
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:06,595
Fuck you, you fucking nigger!

1210
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:12,559
See what I'm talking about?
Just like the rest of them!

1211
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,658
How come you're back so fast?

1212
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:12,286
The keys are in the car. I gotta go.

1213
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:15,080
Whoa! Wait a minute. Come here.
What happened?

1214
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:17,791
It just didn't work out. I gotta go.

1215
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:20,961
- What happened with the girl?
- Everything went wrong.

1216
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:25,507
- You wanna go to the trotters with us?
- No. I don't wanna talk. I gotta go.

1217
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:29,720
- C, you sure? Come on.
- Maybe next time, Sonny.

1218
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,268
Come on.

1219
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:41,606
- Take my car. Bobby, you drive.
- OK, Sonny.

1220
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,884
- Why are you driving Sonny's car?
- What are you talking about?

1221
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,220
What am I talking about?
I just saw you driving Sonny's car.

1222
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:15,223
- I don't want you driving his car.
- I'm not in the mood to hear this.

1223
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:19,353
I don't care. We already talked about
the bikers and that fight in that bar.

1224
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:22,397
- I don't want you in that bar.
- What was I gonna do, run away?

1225
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:25,650
- Make them think I got no heart?
- You think those guys care?

1226
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:27,778
What make you think
you're so special?

1227
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:30,113
- You don't know Sonny.
- I know how he thinks.

1228
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,032
You fuck up,
he'll hurt you like anybody.

1229
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:34,701
- Sonny trusts me.
- That man can't trust anybody.

1230
01:29:34,827 --> 01:29:37,871
The sooner you know that the better.
How many times do I have to tell you?

1231
01:29:37,997 --> 01:29:39,998
People don't respect him.
They fear him.

1232
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:42,084
There's a big difference.
You wanna be somebody?

1233
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,795
Be somebody who works
and takes cares of his family.

1234
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,381
Yeah, look away. Look...

1235
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:50,926
You're my only son. I'm looking out
for your best interests.

1236
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,136
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

1237
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:57,057
- I don't wanna hear this.
- You don't but you're gonna hear it.

1238
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,559
I might not have any money,
I might not have a Cadillac,

1239
01:29:59,685 --> 01:30:01,603
but I don't have to look
over my shoulder.

1240
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,356
I don't answer to anybody.
My parents came here with nothing...

1241
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,733
- And they died with nothing.
- Hey!

1242
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:09,861
Don't you dare disrespect
your grandparents! Do you hear me?

1243
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:12,364
And you're wrong.
They tried to give me a better life.

1244
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,741
- That's what I'm trying to...
- What better life?

1245
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:17,828
We don't even own a car!
We ain't got money, we ain't got nothing!

1246
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:21,164
Don't take it out on me
cos you're a bus driver.

1247
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:22,833
The working man is a sucker!

1248
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:41,393
Hey, C. Look what these black
motherfuckers did to our club.

1249
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:44,646
You believe the balls on these niggers,
throwing eggs at our club?

1250
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:48,108
Come on, get in the car.
We're gonna go fuck them up.

1251
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:49,985
Come on, get in the car.

1252
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:57,617
- Uh-oh, Sonny and Jimmy!
- Oh, shit! Back off! Get out of here!

1253
01:30:57,743 --> 01:30:59,411
What's going on, Sonny?

1254
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:03,081
After you picked up my car,
where did you go?

1255
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:06,126
I drove around and
went to pick up Jane. Why?

1256
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:09,713
- Was there really a Jane? Talk to me!
- Sonny, what is it?

1257
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:12,007
After you dropped that car off,
it didn't start.

1258
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,843
We lifted the hood and there was
something on the engine. It didn't go off.

1259
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:19,848
Tell me how that got on there,
and where did you go in my car!

1260
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:22,684
I picked it up,
I drove right to the school

1261
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,519
and I locked the doors
like you told me.

1262
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,522
Don't lie to me!
Where did you go with my car?

1263
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:30,025
I didn't do anything!
I swear, Sonny! Please!

1264
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,528
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- I didn't do anything!

1265
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:37,365
I swear, I just went right
to the school and that was it!

1266
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:41,620
I swear to God! Why would I hurt you?
You've been like a father to me!

1267
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:57,594
(Lorenzo) Calogero? Hey!

1268
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,347
Calogero! Calogero!

1269
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,933
- What happened to my son?
- Go drive your bus.

1270
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:06,228
- Don't tell me to drive my bus!
- Take it easy!

1271
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,981
Put your hands on me,
I'll stick you in the fucking ground!

1272
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:16,071
Next time find out what's going on
before you open your mouth.

1273
01:32:28,251 --> 01:32:30,001
Yo, C!

1274
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,879
Come here.

1275
01:32:40,429 --> 01:32:43,765
- What happened with you and Sonny?
- Nothing. I don't wanna talk about it.

1276
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:48,895
- Where'd you get this car?
- Don't worry about it. We borrowed it.

1277
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:54,067
Hey, slow down!

1278
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:56,319
Slow the fuck down. I don't wanna
get pinched before we get there.

1279
01:32:56,445 --> 01:33:00,991
- I know. I'm not driver for nothing.
- We're in a hot car. Slow down.

1280
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:04,411
Fuck you! I know what I'm doing.
Don't worry about it.

1281
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:08,456
- What's that smell?
- We made those niggers a cocktail.

1282
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,209
Look at these fucking beauties.

1283
01:33:11,335 --> 01:33:14,087
We're gonna teach
those motherfuckers a lesson.

1284
01:33:14,213 --> 01:33:17,966
- We're gonna finish the job.
- Throwing eggs at our joint? They'll see.

1285
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,885
Here, Ralphie, take this.

1286
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:26,308
- Why don't you give me the big one?
- Take that and shut the fuck up!

1287
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:30,270
I'll take these motherfuckers!
I hate them! I'll kill them!

1288
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:33,189
Ralphie, what are you doing,
lighting a cigarette?

1289
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:36,067
- Relax! What the fuck?
- You got the cocktails at your feet!

1290
01:33:36,193 --> 01:33:39,696
You take me as a jerk-off? Relax.
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

1291
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:42,657
I can't wait to see the look
on these motherfuckers' faces.

1292
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,701
I can't wait...

1293
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:49,497
(Calogero) They were all smiling.
I was too, but I was dying inside.

1294
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:53,084
I wanted out,
but I couldn't get out of the car.

1295
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:57,339
What was I going to say?
"Let me out. I'm afraid. I'm a chicken."

1296
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,549
I could never go back
to that neighbourhood.

1297
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,885
They would call me a punk,
a dog, a mutt.

1298
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,429
They would say I got no heart.

1299
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:08,224
I kept hearing my father's voice
in my head. "Don't blow it, son.

1300
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:12,437
"These people will hurt you, son.
Don't waste your talent, son."

1301
01:34:12,563 --> 01:34:14,356
Then I kept hearing Sonny's voice.

1302
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:19,152
"Be careful, C. Don't lose it, C.
Keep your head, C."

1303
01:34:19,278 --> 01:34:23,615
Somebody pulled the chain,
and I was going down the fucking toilet.

1304
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:33,375
They wanna throw eggs at our club?
We'll give them a big surprise.

1305
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,923
- C, out of the car.
- Sonny, come on, he's with us.

1306
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:42,550
Mind your business, you.
C, outta the car.

1307
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:45,011
Sonny, he's with us...

1308
01:34:45,137 --> 01:34:47,180
- Come on. Move.
- My nose! Fuck!

1309
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:55,605
For the last time,
stay away from this kid.

1310
01:35:19,922 --> 01:35:23,341
I can't believe it. After all this time,
you don't even trust me?

1311
01:35:24,009 --> 01:35:25,802
Listen.
It's not that I don't trust you.

1312
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:30,557
No, I'm not gonna listen. You don't
even believe there was a Jane.

1313
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:32,642
It coulda been in the car
when I picked it up.

1314
01:35:32,768 --> 01:35:36,688
Me and Jane coulda got killed.
You never thought that, did you?

1315
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:42,360
- Don't you trust anybody?
- No.

1316
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:47,365
It's a horrible way to live.

1317
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:49,868
For me, it's the only way.

1318
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:55,290
Not for me.

1319
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:14,476
Oh, C. Some fine-looking black chick
was just here looking for you.

1320
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:17,854
- She just went around the corner?
- If you hurry, you'll catch her.

1321
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,148
- Come here. Come here!
- Told you.

1322
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:27,530
- You want me to go get him?
- No, leave him alone.

1323
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:31,409
Jane!

1324
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:37,582
Hi. My brother told me the truth.
You did try to help him.

1325
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:39,083
I told you.

1326
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,669
I know. But he took it out on you.

1327
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,130
It's OK.
I understand how he felt.

1328
01:36:44,256 --> 01:36:46,174
I'm glad you understand.

1329
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,550
(Window opens)

1330
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:54,307
Mind your own damn business!
Get back in your house!

1331
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:58,728
Let them stare.
Give me your hand.

1332
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:03,775
Come on, give me your hand.

1333
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,405
- Glad you came to see me.
- I missed you.

1334
01:37:09,532 --> 01:37:10,907
I missed you too.

1335
01:37:13,661 --> 01:37:15,537
I think you're beautiful.

1336
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:18,248
Stop.

1337
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:21,125
No, I really do.

1338
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:24,712
I want to be with you,
and I don't care what anybody says.

1339
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:29,509
- Can I have a kiss?
- Sure.

1340
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:40,019
That's not a kiss.

1341
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,064
This is a kiss.

1342
01:37:56,287 --> 01:38:00,206
- Do you know how to make sauce?
- What?

1343
01:38:00,332 --> 01:38:02,750
You know, sauce for macaroni?

1344
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:06,838
Shut up.

1345
01:38:17,933 --> 01:38:19,934
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

1346
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,688
- My brother didn't mean it.
- Where's your car?

1347
01:38:23,814 --> 01:38:26,441
Give me the keys! We gotta go!

1348
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:29,569
- What are you talking about?
- We gotta get there.

1349
01:38:42,499 --> 01:38:44,584
Yes!

1350
01:38:48,964 --> 01:38:51,174
I knew you were one of the great ones.

1351
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,635
Great ones?
What are you talking about?

1352
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,220
Never mind. It's an Italian thing.

1353
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:10,109
(Slick) Come on, come on.
Hurry up, make a U-turn over here.

1354
01:39:10,235 --> 01:39:11,653
Go by in front.

1355
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:17,116
What the fuck are they doing
in our neighbourhood?

1356
01:39:17,242 --> 01:39:19,035
(Tyres screech)

1357
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:23,748
(Gunshot)

1358
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,915
Get it out!

1359
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:00,845
Be careful, guys.

1360
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:02,680
- What's happening?
- What happened?

1361
01:41:02,806 --> 01:41:06,434
- Four white guys just got blown up.
- White guys got killed, that's what.

1362
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:17,445
Willy, are you all right?

1363
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,865
Yeah, I'm all right.

1364
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:30,208
They started out as white,
now they're toast, motherfuckers!

1365
01:41:30,334 --> 01:41:33,086
They look better now, right?

1366
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:36,756
They left something for you
in the trunk! Take a look.

1367
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:39,258
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Get out of our neighbourhood!

1368
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:41,511
Fucking pussy-ass motherfucker!

1369
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:44,055
Don't say shit, man!

1370
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:46,933
Get the fuck outta the neighbourhood!

1371
01:41:48,143 --> 01:41:52,438
When I think about it, I don't know
if I should've been happy or sad.

1372
01:41:52,564 --> 01:41:57,026
Happy because I was alive or
sad because my friends were dead.

1373
01:41:58,237 --> 01:42:00,780
But one thing I knew was
I was grateful.

1374
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:02,615
Grateful because of Sonny.

1375
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:05,409
Sonny!
Listen, Jane, I gotta go.

1376
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:08,329
- I just gotta go. You OK?
- Yeah, man.

1377
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:12,041
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Jive-ass white motherfucker!

1378
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:14,585
Jane, I gotta go.
You don't understand. I was in that car.

1379
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,088
Just go.
The boys are about to go crazy.

1380
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:20,591
What the fuck you looking at?
Fuck that bitch too!

1381
01:42:22,177 --> 01:42:24,262
Go.

1382
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:29,433
Get the fuck out of the neighbourhood!

1383
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:57,670
He saved my life.

1384
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:12,143
I had to tell him.

1385
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:14,854
I wanted to thank Sonny.
He saved my life.

1386
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:31,495
C, I swear, my grandmother's still sick.
I'll give you the 20 next week.

1387
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,289
Forget the 20!

1388
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:50,681
- You know where Sonny is?
- I don't give a fuck where he is!

1389
01:43:50,807 --> 01:43:53,476
I'm losing here!
What are you breaking my balls for?

1390
01:43:53,602 --> 01:43:55,186
C, he's in the front.

1391
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:59,774
- Sonny! Sonny!
- C! Come here!

1392
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:03,986
- Sonny!
- (Sonny) Let him through!

1393
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:06,739
Let my boy through. Come here!

1394
01:44:06,865 --> 01:44:10,243
- Sonny!
- Get over here, come here.

1395
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:15,748
All I could see
was these big smiling faces.

1396
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:21,128
All of a sudden, out of all of these
smiling faces, there was this one face.

1397
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,839
I couldn't understand
why I kept looking at this one face,

1398
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:26,467
and then I realized why:
He wasn't smiling.

1399
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:33,349
All I could see was this guy,
and nobody could see him but me.

1400
01:44:35,477 --> 01:44:37,478
Come on, C!

1401
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:39,647
No!

1402
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,024
Come here!

1403
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:46,570
(Screaming and shouting)

1404
01:44:49,074 --> 01:44:53,452
Get an ambulance!

1405
01:45:10,804 --> 01:45:13,639
The guy that killed Sonny was the son
of the man that he killed

1406
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:16,017
eight years earlier
in front of my house.

1407
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:57,183
There were flowers
all over the place.

1408
01:45:57,309 --> 01:45:59,268
Gangsters have this thing
about flowers.

1409
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:04,607
They think whoever sends
the biggest arrangement cares the most.

1410
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:06,984
(Sobbing)

1411
01:46:15,869 --> 01:46:18,871
- John and Anthony from Detroit.
- How are you?

1412
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:25,461
Did you see the way
he went down, bom-bom-bang?

1413
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:30,424
It was just like
Sonny said it would be.

1414
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:36,180
Nobody cares.

1415
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:54,281
I'm sorry, C,
but we got to close up now.

1416
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,953
Jerry, could you give me
a couple more minutes?

1417
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:01,122
OK. I'll be in my office.

1418
01:47:22,477 --> 01:47:24,937
How are you doing, Sonny?

1419
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:27,189
Not so good, huh?

1420
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:31,527
She passed the test.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1421
01:47:31,653 --> 01:47:34,613
She might be my first great one.

1422
01:47:34,739 --> 01:47:37,992
And I'm gonna go out with her.
Thanks for helping me.

1423
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:43,831
I wanna thank you for saving my life.
I never got a chance to tell you.

1424
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:49,336
They all died.
Slick, Aldo, Mario, Ralphie.

1425
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:51,672
All of them.

1426
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:57,803
Sorry, I thought I was alone.
I'm just thinking out loud.

1427
01:47:57,929 --> 01:47:59,930
That's OK.
It's understandable.

1428
01:48:03,935 --> 01:48:06,979
This man here is a great man.
He saved my life.

1429
01:48:13,028 --> 01:48:15,821
- You Lorenzo the bus driver's kid?
- Yeah.

1430
01:48:15,947 --> 01:48:17,990
- C, right?
- Yeah.

1431
01:48:18,116 --> 01:48:19,992
Sonny told me all about you.

1432
01:48:20,118 --> 01:48:22,369
Sorry, but I don't even know
who you are.

1433
01:48:23,246 --> 01:48:25,331
My name is Carmine.

1434
01:48:25,457 --> 01:48:28,292
We go back a long way together,
Sonny and me.

1435
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,254
He saved my life too once.

1436
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:38,719
You don't remember me, do you?

1437
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,349
Many years ago?
In front of your house?

1438
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:46,810
You don't remember this?

1439
01:48:47,687 --> 01:48:51,023
You were the guy who got hit
with the baseball bat, right?

1440
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:55,861
Yeah, I remember.
I was there. I saw the whole thing.

1441
01:48:55,987 --> 01:48:57,488
I know, kid.

1442
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:00,783
Sonny told me what you did.

1443
01:49:01,701 --> 01:49:04,745
Listen, I've been away.

1444
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:08,791
But I'll be in the neighbourhood now
taking care of things for a while.

1445
01:49:08,917 --> 01:49:12,711
You need anything,
come and see me at the bar, OK?

1446
01:49:12,837 --> 01:49:16,298
I think I'll give the bar a rest
for a while, but thanks anyway.

1447
01:49:16,424 --> 01:49:18,133
It's OK. I understand.

1448
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,637
Was that fight really
over a parking space?

1449
01:49:23,473 --> 01:49:25,015
No.

1450
01:49:38,863 --> 01:49:42,491
Don't forget. You need anything,
come to the bar and see me.

1451
01:49:42,617 --> 01:49:44,868
- Anything.
- All right.

1452
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:46,870
So long, kid.

1453
01:49:58,717 --> 01:50:00,759
Dad, what are you doing here?

1454
01:50:04,222 --> 01:50:07,141
I came to pay my respects
to your friend.

1455
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:10,185
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1456
01:50:10,312 --> 01:50:12,855
Dad, I'm sorry
if I ever hurt you in any way.

1457
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:17,276
That's OK.

1458
01:50:17,402 --> 01:50:19,737
Everything's gonna be OK.

1459
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:32,166
Sonny, I want to thank you
for saving my kid's life.

1460
01:50:35,503 --> 01:50:37,796
I never hated you.
I guess it's...

1461
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:43,135
...that I was mad at you because
you made him grow up so fast.

1462
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:49,892
May God have mercy on your soul.

1463
01:50:54,522 --> 01:50:56,357
I'll wait over here.

1464
01:51:01,196 --> 01:51:05,866
Sonny, did you hear that?
My father didn't hate you.

1465
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:09,620
Nobody cares, huh?

1466
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:13,582
You were wrong about that one.

1467
01:51:19,297 --> 01:51:20,839
Wasted talent.

1468
01:51:26,179 --> 01:51:28,931
See you around, Sonny.

1469
01:51:37,482 --> 01:51:39,525
Let's go home, C.

1470
01:51:45,782 --> 01:51:47,783
Sonny and my father always said

1471
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:50,703
that when I get older
I would understand.

1472
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:53,080
Well, I finally did.

1473
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:55,457
I learned something
from these two men.

1474
01:51:55,583 --> 01:51:58,544
I learned to give love
and get love unconditionally.

1475
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:01,964
You just have to accept people
for what they are.

1476
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:04,174
And I learned
the greatest gift of all.

1477
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:08,137
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

1478
01:52:08,263 --> 01:52:11,849
And the choices that you make
will shape your life forever.

1479
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:15,436
But you can ask anybody
from my neighbourhood

1480
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:17,396
and they'll just tell you.

1481
01:52:17,522 --> 01:52:19,898
This is just another Bronx tale.

1482
