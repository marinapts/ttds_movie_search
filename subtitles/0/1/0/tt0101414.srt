1
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,500
Once upon a time
in a faraway land

2
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,000
a young prince lived
in a shining castle.

3
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,500
Although he had
everything his heart desired

4
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,300
the prince was spoiled,
selfish and unkind.

5
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,500
But then, one winter's night

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,600
an old beggar woman
came to the castle

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
and offered him a single rose

8
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,600
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold.

9
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,100
Repulsed by
her haggard appearance

10
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,800
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away

11
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,600
but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,500
for beauty is found within

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,000
and when he dismissed her again

14
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,800
the old woman's ugliness
melted away

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,400
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,700
The prince tried to apologize,
but it was too late

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,700
and as punishment,
she transformed him

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,200
into a hideous beast

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,400
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,100
and all who lived there.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Ashamed of his monstrous form

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,800
the Beast concealed himself
inside his castle

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,700
with a magic mirror
as his only window

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,200
to the outside world.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,300
The rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,700
which would bloom
until his 21st year.

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,300
If he could learn
to love another

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,300
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,100
then the spell would be broken.

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,400
If not, he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time.

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,100
As the years passed,
he fell into despair

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,900
and lost all hope

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,000
for who could ever learn
to love a beast?

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,100
Little town,
it's a quiet village

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Every day like the one before

37
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,800
Little town,
full of little people

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,100
Waking up... to... say...

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,600
Bonjour!

40
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,400
- Bonjour!

41
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,400
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

42
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,000
Bonjour!

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
There goes the baker

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,400
With his tray like always

45
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,500
The same old bread
and rolls to sell

46
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,200
Every morning just the same

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Since the morning that we came

48
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,200
To this poor provincial town...

49
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Good morning, Belle.

50
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Good morning, Monsieur.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Where are you off to?

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,900
The bookshop.

53
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,100
I just finished
the most wonderful story

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,900
about a beanstalk
and an ogre, and...

55
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,900
That's nice.

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,100
Marie! The baguettes.

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,600
Hurry up!

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Look, there she goes

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,900
The girl is strange, no question

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,300
Dazed and distracted,
can't you tell?

61
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,900
Never part of any crowd

62
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,600
'Cause her head's
up on some cloud

63
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,400
No denying she's a funny girl,
that Belle

64
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,300
Bonjour

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Good day

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,000
How is your family?

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,900
Bonjour

68
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,800
Good day

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,700
How is your wife?

70
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,400
I need six eggs

71
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,900
That's too expensive

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,100
There must be more
than this provincial life...

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,300
Ah, Belle.

74
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Good morning.

75
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
I've come to return
the book I borrowed.

76
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
Finished already?

77
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,200
Oh, I couldn't put it down.

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,100
Have you got anything new?

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,100
Not since yesterday.

80
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,500
That's all right.

81
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,500
I'll borrow... this one.

82
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,400
That one?

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,800
But you've read it twice.

84
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, it's my favorite...
far-off places

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
daring sword fights

86
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,900
magic spells,
a prince in disguise.

87
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,100
If you like it
all that much, it's yours.

88
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
-But, sir...
-I insist.

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Well, thank you.

90
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you very much.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
Look, there she goes

92
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,100
That girl is so peculiar

93
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,200
I wonder if she's feeling well

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
With a dreamy, far-off look

95
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,500
And her nose stuck in a book

96
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,500
What a puzzle to the rest
of us is Belle

97
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Oh, isn't this amazing?

98
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:10,200
It's my favorite part
because you'll see

99
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,800
Here's where she meets
Prince Charming

100
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,200
But she won't discover
that it's him

101
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,300
Till Chapter Three

102
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

103
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,600
Now, it's no wonder
that her name means beauty

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,600
Her looks have got no parallel

105
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,300
But behind that fair facade

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,300
I'm afraid she's rather odd

107
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Very different
from the rest of us

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
She's nothing like
the rest of us

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,700
Yes, different
from the rest of us is Belle

110
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Wow, you didn't miss
a shot, Gaston.

111
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
You're the greatest hunter

112
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
in the whole world.

113
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,500
I know.

114
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,400
No beast alive
stands a chance against you

115
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,300
and no girl, for that matter.

116
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
It's true, Lefou

117
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
and I've got my sights set
on that one.

118
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,100
The inventor's daughter?

119
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,800
She's the one... the lucky girl
I'm going to marry.

120
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
But, she...

121
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,100
The most beautiful girl in town.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,100
I know, but...

123
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,800
That makes her the best

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,500
and don't I deserve the best?

125
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Well, of course.

126
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
I mean, you do, but...

127
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,700
Right from the moment
when I met her, saw her

128
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:14,700
I said, "She's gorgeous,"
and I fell

129
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,500
I said, "She's gorgeous,"
and I fell

130
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Here in town there's only she
who is beautiful as me

131
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,100
So, I'm making plans
to woo and marry Belle

132
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Look, there he goes,
isn't he dreamy?

133
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,600
Monsieur Gaston,
oh, he's so cute

134
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,100
Be still, my heart,
I'm hardly breathing

135
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,400
He's such a tall, dark,
strong and handsome brute

136
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,500
-Bonjour -Pardon
-Good day -Mais oui

137
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
-You call this bacon?
-What lovely grapes

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
-Ten yards -Some cheese
-'Scuse me -One pound

139
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
I'll get the knife

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,700
Please let me through

141
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
-This bread -Those fish

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,700
-It's stale -They smell

143
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,600
Madame's mistaken

144
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
There must be more

145
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,300
Than this provincial life

146
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,000
Just watch, I'm going
to make Belle my wife

147
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Look, there she goes

148
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,400
A girl who's strange
but special

149
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,500
A most peculiar mademoiselle

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,900
It's a pity and a sin

151
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
She doesn't quite fit in

152
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,200
'Cause she really is
a funny girl

153
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,400
A beauty but a funny girl

154
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,400
She really is a funny girl

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,100
That Belle...

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,900
Bonjour, bonjour.

157
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,000
Hello, Belle.

158
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,600
Bonjour, Gaston.

159
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,700
Gaston,
may I have my book, please?

160
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,700
How can you read this?

161
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,800
There's no pictures.

162
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,800
Well, some people
use their imagination.

163
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,800
Belle, it's about time
you got your head

164
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
out of those books

165
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,400
and paid attention
to more important things...

166
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,200
like me.

167
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,500
The whole town's
talking about it.

168
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
It's not right
for a woman to read.

169
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,100
Soon she starts getting ideas,
and thinking...

170
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,500
Gaston,
you are positively primeval.

171
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,600
Why, thank you, Belle.

172
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,600
What do you say you and me
take a walk over to the tavern

173
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,100
and take a look at my trophies?

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Maybe some other time.

175
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,900
What's wrong with her?

176
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
She's crazy.

177
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,300
He's gorgeous.

178
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,600
Please, Gaston, I can't.

179
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,700
I have to get home
to help my father.

180
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Good-bye.

181
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,100
That crazy old loon...

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
he needs all the
help he can get.

183
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,900
Don't talk about my father
that way.

184
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,500
Yeah, don't talk
about her father that way.

185
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,700
My father is not crazy.

186
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,600
He's a genius.

187
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,400
Ooh!

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
Papa?

189
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,200
How on earth did that happen?

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,500
Doggone it!

191
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,300
Are you all right, Papa?

192
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm about ready to give
up on this hunk of junk.

193
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,500
You always say that.

194
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,600
I mean it this time.

195
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,500
I'll never get

196
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
this boneheaded contraption
to work!

197
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,800
Yes, you will

198
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,100
and you'll win first prize
at the fair tomorrow.

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Humph!

200
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,800
And become
a world-famous inventor.

201
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,600
You really believe that?

202
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,100
I always have.

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,100
Well, what are we waiting for?

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,600
I'll have this thing fixed
in no time.

205
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,900
Hand me that, uh...

206
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,600
dog-legged clincher, there.

207
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,200
So, did you have a
good time in town today?

208
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,300
I got a new book.

209
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,600
Papa, do you think I'm odd?

210
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
My daughter? Odd?

211
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,500
Where would you get
an idea like that?

212
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,400
Oh, I don't know.

213
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,200
It's just that I'm not sure
I fit in here.

214
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,500
There's no one
I can really talk to.

215
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
What about that Gaston?

216
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,900
He's a handsome fellow.

217
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,500
He's handsome, all right,
and rude, and conceited, and...

218
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,100
Oh, Papa, he's not for me.

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
Well, don't you worry

220
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,300
'cause this invention's
going to be the start

221
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
of a new life for us.

222
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
I think that's done it.

223
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,700
Now, let's give it a try.

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,300
It works!

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,500
It does?

226
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
It does!

227
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
You did it!

228
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,700
You really did it!

229
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,400
Hitch up Philippe, girl.

230
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm off to the fair!

231
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,100
Good-bye, Papa.

232
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,400
Good luck.

233
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,500
Good-bye, Belle,
and take care while I'm gone.

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We should be there by now.

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We should be there by now.

236
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,200
Maybe we've missed the turn.

237
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,900
I guess I should have taken...

238
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,300
Wait a minute.

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,300
Let's go this way.

240
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,200
Come on, Philippe,
it's a shortcut.

241
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,500
We'll be there in no time.

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
This can't be right.

243
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,200
Where have you taken us,
Philippe?

244
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,800
We'd better turn around.

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
Whoa...

246
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
Whoa, boy, whoa, whoa, Philippe.

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Oh...!

248
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh, look out!

249
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,300
Whoa!

250
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,200
Whoa, boy!

251
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,000
Back up, back up, back up!

252
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Good boy, good boy.

253
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
That's it.

254
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Back up!

255
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
Steady, steady.

256
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Now, steady.

257
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,500
Philippe, no!

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,300
Philippe.

259
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,700
Oh...

260
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,200
Help!

261
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,400
Is someone there?!

262
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,400
Oh!

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,500
What...?

264
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Oh...

265
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Hello?

266
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Hello?

267
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,300
Poor fellow, must have
lost his way in the woods.

268
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,300
Keep quiet; maybe he'll go away.

269
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Is someone there?

270
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,100
Not a word, Lumiere;
not one word.

271
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,800
I don't mean to intrude,
but I've lost my horse

272
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,000
and I need a place to stay
for the night.

273
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Oh, Cogs worth, have a heart.

274
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,300
Shh!

275
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,800
Of course, Monsieur,
you are welcome here.

276
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
Who said that?

277
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Over here.

278
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,200
Where?

279
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,100
Allo.

280
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,000
Incredible.

281
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,600
Well, now you've done it,
Lumiere.

282
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,600
Splendid, just peachy. Ah!

283
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,900
How is this accomplished?

284
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,000
Put me down at once!

285
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,100
Stop that!

286
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,300
Stop that, I say.

287
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Ow!

288
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,900
Huh... Close that at once.

289
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,200
Do you mind?!

290
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,500
l-I beg your pardon.

291
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,400
It's, it's just
that I've never seen a...

292
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Oh, you are soaked to the bone,
Monsieur.

293
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,900
Come, warm yourself by the fire.

294
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Thank you.

295
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,800
No, no, no.

296
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,200
You know what the master will do
if he finds him here.

297
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,700
I demand
that you stop right there.

298
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
Oh, no, no!

299
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,600
Not the master's chair.

300
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,300
I'm not seeing this!

301
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,400
I am not seeing this!

302
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,900
Well, hello there, boy.

303
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,800
What service.

304
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,600
All right,
this has gone far enough.

305
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,900
I'm in charge here.

306
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,200
How would you like
a nice spot of tea, sir?

307
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,600
It'll warm you up
in no time.

308
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,500
No. No tea.

309
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,800
No tea!

310
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,700
His mustache tickles, Mama.

311
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh!

312
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,800
Hello.

313
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,200
Uh-oh.

314
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,200
Oh...

315
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,400
Ah...

316
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
There's a stranger here.

317
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,700
Master, allow me to explain.

318
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,600
The gentleman
was lost in the woods.

319
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,800
He was cold and wet...

320
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,100
Master, I'd like
to take this moment to say

321
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
I was against this
from the start.

322
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
It was all his fault.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,100
I tried to stop them,
but would they listen to me? No.

324
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Who are you?

325
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,800
What are you doing here?

326
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,200
l-l-I was lost in the woods,
and, and...

327
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,000
You're not welcome here!

328
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,100
l-l-I'm sorry.

329
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,000
What are you staring at?!

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
N-Nothing.

331
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,600
So, you've come to stare
at the Beast, have you?!

332
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,800
Please, I meant no harm!

333
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,600
I just needed a place to stay.

334
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,400
I'll give you a place to stay.

335
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,500
Oh, no...!

336
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,500
Please! Oh, no!

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Oh, boy, Belle's going to get
the surprise of her life

338
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,000
huh, Gaston?

339
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,600
Yep. This is her lucky day.

340
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,600
I'd like to thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

341
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,000
But first I'd better go in there
and propose to the girl.

342
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,100
And you, Lefou... now, when Belle
and I come out that door...

343
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,700
Oh, I know, I know!

344
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,200
l-I strike up the band.

345
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,500
Not yet!

346
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,100
Sorry.

347
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,800
Gaston.

348
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,500
What a pleasant surprise.

349
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,700
Isn't it, though?

350
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,800
I'm just full of surprises.

351
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,800
You know, Belle, there's
not a girl in town

352
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,600
who wouldn't love
to be in your shoes.

353
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,700
This is the day...

354
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,200
Hmm.

355
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,300
Yeah.

356
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,200
This is the day your
dreams come true.

357
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,300
This is the day your
dreams come true.

358
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,600
What do you know
about my dreams, Gaston?

359
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,900
Plenty. Here, picture this:

360
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
A rustic hunting lodge

361
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,800
my latest kill
roasting on the fire

362
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,700
and my little wife,
massaging my feet

363
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,600
while the little ones
play on the floor with the dogs.

364
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,600
We'll have six or seven.

365
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,400
Dogs?

366
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,400
No, Belle!

367
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,600
Strapping boys, like me.

368
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Imagine that.

369
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
And do you know

370
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,000
who that little wife will be?

371
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Let me think.

372
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
You, Belle.

373
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,000
Gaston, I'm...

374
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm...

375
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,500
speechless.

376
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,900
I really don't know what to say.

377
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,700
Say you'll marry me.

378
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,900
I'm very sorry, Gaston, but...

379
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,100
but... I just don't deserve you.

380
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,700
Whoa!

381
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,200
So, how'd it go?

382
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll have Belle for my wife.

383
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,000
Make no mistake about that!

384
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Touchy.

385
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,100
Is he gone?

386
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,300
Can you imagine?

387
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,200
He asked me to marry him.

388
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,500
Me, the wife of that boorish,
brainless...

389
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,100
Madame Gaston

390
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,600
Can't you just see it?

391
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,900
Madame Gaston

392
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,400
His little wife

393
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,800
No, sir, not me

394
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,100
I guarantee it

395
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,700
I want much more
than this provincial life

396
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,900
I want adventure
in the great, wide somewhere

397
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,300
I want it more than I can tell

398
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,900
And for once it might be grand

399
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,000
To have someone understand

400
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:01,000
I want so much more
than they've got planned.

401
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,000
Philippe!
What are you doing here?

402
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,300
Where's...?

403
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,400
Where's Papa?

404
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,800
Where is he, Philippe?

405
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,900
What happened?

406
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,300
Oh, we have to find him.

407
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,900
You have to take me to him.

408
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
What is this place?

409
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Philippe, please!

410
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Steady!

411
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,900
Steady.

412
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,900
Papa.

413
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,700
Couldn't keep quiet, could we?

414
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,800
Just had to invite him
to stay, didn't we?

415
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,300
Serve him tea.

416
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
Sit in the master's chair.

417
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,100
Pet the pooch.

418
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,800
I was trying
to be hospitable.

419
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,400
Hello?

420
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,000
Is anyone here?

421
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,600
Hello? Papa?

422
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,500
Papa?

423
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,500
Are you here?

424
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Mama, there's a girl
in the castle.

425
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,700
Now, Chip, I'll not have you
making up such wild stories.

426
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,900
Really, Mama. I saw her.

427
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Not another word.

428
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
But...

429
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Into the tub.

430
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Woop...

431
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Well! I saw a girl
in the castle!

432
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,100
See? I told you.

433
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,900
Irresponsible, devil-may-care,
waxy-eared, slack-jawed...

434
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,800
Papa?

435
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,300
Did you see that?

436
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,100
It's a girl!

437
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
I know it's a girl.

438
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,200
Don't you see?

439
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,200
She's the one...

440
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,900
the girl we have
been waiting for.

441
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,200
She has come to break the spell!

442
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,600
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

443
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,400
Papa?

444
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,800
Papa?

445
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,700
Hello?

446
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,500
Is someone here?

447
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,800
Wait!

448
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
I'm looking for my father. I...

449
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,100
That's funny.

450
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm sure there was someone.

451
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,300
I-Is anyone here?

452
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,500
Belle?

453
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,400
Papa!

454
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,800
H-How did you find me?

455
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,300
Oh, your hands are like ice.

456
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,200
I have to get you out of there.

457
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,400
Belle, I want you
to leave this place.

458
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,300
Who's done this to you?

459
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,600
No time to explain.

460
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
You must go! Now!

461
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I won't leave you!

462
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
What are you doing here?

463
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,900
Run, Belle!

464
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,500
Who's there?
Who are you?

465
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,200
The master of this castle.

466
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,600
I've come for my father.

467
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,900
Please let him out.

468
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,100
Can't you see he's sick?

469
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,200
Then he shouldn't have
trespassed here!

470
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
But he could die.

471
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,800
Please, l-I'll do anything.

472
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,400
There's nothing you can do.

473
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,400
He's my prisoner.

474
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,900
Oh, there must be
some way I can...

475
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,800
Wait!

476
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Take me instead.

477
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,500
You?!

478
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
You would...

479
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,500
take his place?

480
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Belle, no!

481
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
You don't know
what you're doing!

482
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,500
If I did,
would you let him go?

483
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes. But you must promise
to stay here forever.

484
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,400
Come into the light.

485
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
No, Belle!

486
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,700
I won't let you do this!

487
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,000
You have my word.

488
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
Done!

489
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,500
No, Belle, listen to me.

490
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm old. I've lived my life.

491
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,000
Wait.

492
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,700
Belle!

493
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,300
Wait!

494
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,000
No, please spare my daughter.

495
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,000
Please!

496
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,400
She's no longer your concern.

497
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,700
Take him to the village.

498
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Let me out!

499
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,900
Please let me out!

500
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
Let me out!

501
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,200
Please! Oh, please!

502
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Master?

503
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
What?

504
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,200
Since the girl is going
to be with us

505
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,400
for quite some time

506
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,500
I was thinking that you
might want to offer her

507
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,000
a more comfortable room.

508
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,100
Then again, maybe not.

509
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
You didn't even let me
say good-bye.

510
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
I'll never see him again.

511
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,300
I didn't get to say good-bye.

512
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,900
I'll show you to your room.

513
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,300
My room?

514
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,600
But I thought...

515
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
You want to stay in the tower?

516
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,300
No.

517
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
Then follow me.

518
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,800
Say something to her.

519
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Huh? Oh.

520
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,200
l, uh, hope you like it here.

521
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,000
The castle is your home now,
so you can go anywhere you like

522
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,100
except the west wing.

523
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,800
What's in the west...?

524
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,800
It's forbidden!

525
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,400
Now, if you need anything

526
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,400
my servants will attend you.

527
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,700
Dinner.
Invite her to dinner.

528
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,500
You will join me for dinner.

529
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,500
That's not a request!

530
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,900
Who does she think she is?

531
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,800
That girl has tangled
with the wrong man.

532
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
No one says no to Gaston.

533
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Darn right.

534
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,800
Dismissed, rejected...

535
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,200
publicly humiliated.

536
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,600
Why, it's more than I can bear.

537
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
More beer?

538
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,300
What for?

539
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,600
Nothing helps.

540
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,800
I'm disgraced.

541
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
Who, you?

542
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,700
Never!

543
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Gaston, you've got
to pull yourself together.

544
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,800
Gosh, it disturbs me
to see you, Gaston

545
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,500
Looking so down in the dumps

546
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Every guy here'd
love to be you, Gaston

547
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,000
Even when taking your lumps

548
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,700
There's no man in town
as admired as you

549
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,300
You're everyone's favorite guy

550
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,100
Everyone's awed
and inspired by you

551
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,900
And it's not very hard
to see why

552
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,200
No... one's...

553
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,400
Slick as Gaston

554
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,300
No one's quick as Gaston

555
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,500
No one's neck's
as incredibly thick as Gaston

556
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,100
For there's no man in town
half as manly

557
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,300
Perfect, a pure paragon

558
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,600
You can ask any Tom, Dick
or Stanley

559
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,900
And they'll tell you whose team

560
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,500
They prefer to be on

561
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,400
Ooh!

562
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,600
No... one's...
been like Gaston

563
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,000
A kingpin like Gaston

564
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
No one's got a full cleft

565
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,200
In his chin like Gaston

566
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,000
As a specimen, yes,
I'm intimidating

567
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,900
My, what a guy, that Gaston

568
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,300
Give five "hurrahs!"

569
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,000
Give 12 "hip-hips!"

570
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,700
Gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

571
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,900
No... one...

572
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,100
Fights like Gaston

573
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,800
Douses lights like Gaston

574
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,000
In a wrestling match,
nobody bites like Gaston

575
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,100
For there's no one
as burly and brawny

576
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,300
As you see,
I've got biceps to spare

577
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,500
Not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny

578
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,800
That's right

579
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,000
And every last inch of me's
covered with hair

580
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,200
No one hits like Gaston

581
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,500
Matches wits like Gaston

582
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,600
In a spitting match,
nobody spits like Gaston

583
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm especially good
at expectorating

584
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,400
Ptooey!

585
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Ten points for Gaston!

586
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,700
When I was a lad

587
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I ate four dozen eggs

588
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,600
Every morning
to help me get large

589
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,700
And now that I'm grown

590
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,400
I eat five dozen eggs

591
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,300
So I'm roughly
the size of a barge

592
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,200
No... one...

593
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
Shoots like Gaston

594
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,400
Makes those beauts like Gaston

595
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Then goes tromping around
wearing boots like Gaston

596
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,300
I use antlers
in all of my decorating

597
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,400
My, what a guy

598
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,600
Gaston!

599
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:22,900
Help!

600
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,800
Help!

601
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Someone help me!

602
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,600
Maurice?

603
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,100
Please, please!

604
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,300
I need your help.

605
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,400
He's got her...

606
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,000
He's got her locked
in the dungeon.

607
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,900
Who?

608
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Belle. We must go.

609
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
N-Not a minute to lose.

610
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Whoa!

611
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,900
Slow down, Maurice.

612
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Who's got Belle locked
in a dungeon?

613
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,100
A beast!

614
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,700
A horrible, monstrous beast.

615
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,100
Is it a big beast?

616
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Huge!

617
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,400
With a long ugly snout?

618
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,500
Hideously ugly.

619
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
And sharp, cruel fangs?

620
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes, yes.

621
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,500
Will you help me?

622
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
All right, old man.

623
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,800
We'll help you out.

624
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,700
You will?

625
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,600
Oh, thank you.

626
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,600
Thank you.
Thank you!

627
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,600
Oh!

628
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,400
Oh!

629
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,400
Crazy old Maurice.

630
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,300
He's always good for a laugh.

631
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,100
Crazy old Maurice, hmm?

632
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,900
Crazy old Maurice... hmm.

633
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Lefou, I'm afraid
I've been thinking

634
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,900
A dangerous pastime...

635
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,800
I know

636
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,200
But that wacky old coot
is Belle's father

637
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,900
And his sanity's only so-so

638
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,900
Now the wheels in my head
have been turning

639
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,400
Since I looked
at that loony old man

640
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,100
See, I promised myself

641
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,200
I'd be married to Belle

642
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,000
And right now,
I'm evolving a plan

643
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,900
If I...

644
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Yes?

645
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,800
Then we...

646
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
No! Would she...?

647
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Guess!

648
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,700
Now I get it!

649
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,400
Let's go!

650
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,300
No... one...

651
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
Plots like Gaston

652
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,600
Takes cheap shots like Gaston

653
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,500
Plans to persecute
harmless crackpots like Gaston

654
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,800
So his marriage
we soon will be celebrating

655
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,100
My, what a guy!

656
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,100
Gaston!

657
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Will no one help me?

658
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,800
Who is it?

659
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,100
Mrs. Potts, dear.

660
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,000
I thought you might
like a spot of tea.

661
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
But you're... you're a...

662
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,000
Ooh!

663
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,900
Careful.

664
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,800
This is impossible.

665
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,300
I know it is.

666
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,100
But here we are.

667
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,600
I told you she was pretty, Mama,
didn't I?

668
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,900
All right, Chip,
now, that'll do.

669
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Slowly now.

670
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,300
Don't spill.

671
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,800
Thank you.

672
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,300
Want to see me do a trick?

673
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,500
Chip!

674
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,500
Oops. Sorry.

675
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,000
That was a very brave thing
you did, my dear.

676
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,500
We all think so.

677
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,000
But I've lost my father,
my dreams... everything.

678
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,200
Cheer up, child.

679
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,600
It'll turn out
all right in the end.

680
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,700
You'll see.

681
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,800
Oh, listen to me.

682
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,200
Jabbering on while
there's a supper

683
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
to get on the table.

684
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,100
Chip!

685
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,300
Bye.

686
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,900
Well, now, what shall we
dress you in for dinner?

687
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,300
Oh, let's see what I got
in my drawers.

688
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,700
Ooh! How embarrassing.

689
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,200
Ah, here we are.

690
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,900
You'll look ravishing
in this one.

691
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,800
That's very kind of you, but...
I'm not going to dinner.

692
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,400
Oh, but you must.

693
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,400
Dinner is served.

694
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,800
What's taking so long?

695
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,600
I told her to come down.

696
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,800
Why isn't she here yet?

697
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,500
Oh, try to be patient, sir.

698
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,500
The girl has lost her father
and her freedom, all in one day.

699
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,500
Master, have you thought

700
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
that perhaps this girl could
be the one to break the spell?

701
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,700
Of course I have.

702
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm not a fool.

703
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,200
Good!

704
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,000
So, you fall in love with her,
she falls in love with you

705
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,200
and poof! the spell is broken.

706
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We'll be human again
by midnight.

707
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,700
Ooh, it's not that easy,
Lumiere.

708
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,900
These things take time.

709
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,900
But the rose has already
begun to wilt.

710
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Oh, it's no use.

711
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,400
She's so beautiful, and I'm...

712
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,400
Well, look at me!

713
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Oh, you must help her
to see past all that.

714
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,600
I don't know how.

715
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,900
Well, you can start

716
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,500
by making yourself
more presentable.

717
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,600
Straighten up.

718
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,200
Try to act like a gentleman.

719
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,600
Ah, yes.
When she comes in

720
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,500
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

721
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,200
Come, come,
show me the smile.

722
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,900
But don't frighten
the poor girl.

723
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,600
Impress her
with your rapier wit.

724
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
But be gentle.

725
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,800
Shower her
with compliments.

726
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,700
But be sincere.

727
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,700
And above all...

728
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,600
You must control your temper!

729
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,300
Here she is!

730
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000
Good evening.

731
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Well, where is she?

732
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,000
Who? Oh.

733
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,200
The girl, yes.

734
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,400
The... girl.

735
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,600
Well, actually,
she's in the process of...

736
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,000
Circumstances being
what they are...

737
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,300
She's not coming.

738
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,400
What?!

739
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,600
But, Your Grace...!

740
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,900
Your Eminence!

741
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,900
I thought I told you
to come down to dinner!

742
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,100
I'm not hungry.

743
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
You come out, or I'll...

744
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,800
I'll... I'll break down
the door!

745
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,800
Master...

746
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,300
I could be wrong,
but that may not be

747
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,100
the best way
to win the girl's affections.

748
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,500
Please attempt
to be a gentleman.

749
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,200
But she is being so difficult.

750
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,600
Gently, gently.

751
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,000
Will you come down to dinner?

752
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,200
No.

753
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,400
Hmm?

754
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,400
Ah, ah, ah!

755
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,700
Suave, genteel.

756
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,800
It would give me great pleasure
if you would join me for dinner.

757
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,600
We say please.

758
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,100
Please.

759
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,900
No, thank you!

760
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,300
You can't stay in there forever!

761
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,600
Yes, I can.

762
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,200
Fine. Then go ahead and starve!

763
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,900
If she doesn't eat with me,
then she doesn't eat at all.

764
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,900
Oh, dear.

765
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,400
That didn't go very well
at all, did it?

766
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,200
Lumiere, stand watch
at the door

767
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,900
and inform me at once

768
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,600
if there is
the slightest change.

769
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,300
You can count on me,
mon capitan.

770
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,700
Well, we might as well
go downstairs

771
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,500
and start cleaning up.

772
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,000
I ask nicely,
but she refuses.

773
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,600
Well, what does
she want me to do... beg?

774
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,600
Show me the girl.

775
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Well, the master's
really not so bad

776
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
once you get to know him.

777
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,300
Why don't you give him a chance?

778
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,700
I don't want to get to know him.

779
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
I don't want to have anything
to do with him!

780
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,500
I don't want to have anything
to do with him!

781
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,100
I'm just fooling myself.

782
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,100
She'll never see me
as anything...

783
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,600
but a monster.

784
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,600
It's hopeless.

785
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,600
Oh, no!

786
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,800
Oh, yes!

787
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,800
Oh, no!

788
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,900
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

789
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,200
I've been burned by you before.

790
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,400
Zut, alors!
She has emerged!

791
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,800
Come on, Chip, into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

792
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,300
Come on, Chip, into the cupboard
with your brothers and sisters.

793
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,100
But I'm not sleepy.

794
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,700
Yes, you are.

795
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,000
No, I'm not.

796
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,100
I work and I slave all day long
and for what?

797
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,000
A culinary masterpiece
gone to waste.

798
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,100
Oh, stop your grousing.

799
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's been a long night
for all of us.

800
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,800
Well, if you ask me,
she was just being stubborn.

801
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,400
After all, he did say please.

802
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,300
But if the master doesn't learn
to control that temper

803
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,800
he'll never break...

804
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,500
Splendid to see you
out and about, Mademoiselle.

805
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I am Cogs worth,
head of the household.

806
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,400
This is Lumiere.

807
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,500
Enchante, cherie.

808
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,800
If there's... Stop that!

809
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,200
...anything we... Please!

810
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,600
can do to make your
stay more comfortable.

811
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Ow!

812
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,800
I am a little hungry.

813
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,700
You are?

814
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,400
Hear that? She's hungry.

815
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Stoke the fire.

816
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,900
Break out the silver.

817
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
Wake the china.

818
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,900
Remember what the master said.

819
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,800
Oh, pishposh.

820
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm not about to let
the poor child go hungry.

821
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,900
All right, fine.

822
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,800
Glass of water, crust
of bread, and then...

823
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,200
Cogs worth,
I am surprised at you.

824
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,500
She is not a prisoner.
She's our guest.

825
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,700
We must make her
feel welcome here.

826
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,200
Right this way,
Mademoiselle.

827
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Well, keep it down.

828
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
If the master finds out
about this

829
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,300
it will be our necks.

830
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,600
Of course, of course.

831
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,300
But what is dinner
without a little music?

832
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,000
Music?

833
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,700
Ma chere
mademoiselle.

834
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,800
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure

835
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,700
that we welcome you tonight.

836
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,700
And now we invite you to relax.

837
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
And now we invite you to relax.

838
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,300
Let us pull up a chair

839
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,900
as the dining room
proudly presents...

840
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
your dinner.

841
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,900
Be... our... guest

842
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,200
Be our guest

843
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,100
Put our service to the test

844
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,800
Tie your napkin 'round
your neck, cherie

845
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,300
And we provide the rest

846
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,700
Soup du jour,
Hot hors d'oeuvres

847
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,400
Why, we only live to serve

848
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,700
Try the gray stuff

849
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,800
It's delicious

850
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,000
Don't believe me, ask the dishes

851
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,100
They can sing, they can dance

852
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,300
After all, Miss, this is France

853
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,300
And a dinner here
is never second best

854
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,500
Go on, unfold your menu

855
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,400
Take a glance and then

856
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
You'll be our guest

857
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,500
Oui, our guest

858
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,400
Be our guest

859
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,700
Beef ragout, cheese souffle

860
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,500
Pie and pudding en flambe

861
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
We'll prepare and serve
with flair

862
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,600
A culinary cabaret

863
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,600
You're alone and you're scared

864
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,700
But the banquet's all prepared

865
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
No one's gloomy or complaining

866
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,500
While the flatware's
entertaining

867
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,700
We tell jokes, I do tricks

868
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,800
With my fellow candlesticks

869
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,800
And it's all in perfect taste,
that you can bet

870
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,700
Come on and lift your glass

871
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,200
You've won your own free pass

872
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,200
To be our guest...

873
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,700
If you're stressed

874
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,800
It's fine dining we suggest...

875
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,000
Be our guest, be our guest

876
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,700
Be our guest!

877
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,900
Life is so unnerving

878
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,700
For a servant who's not serving

879
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,800
He's not whole
without a soul to wait upon

880
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,300
Get off!

881
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,800
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

882
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,200
Huh?

883
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Suddenly, those good
old days are gone

884
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,800
Oh!

885
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,500
Ten years we've been rusting

886
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,800
Needing so much more
than dusting

887
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Needing exercise

888
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,600
A chance to use our skills

889
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,300
Most days we just
lay around the castle

890
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,500
Flabby, fat and lazy

891
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,500
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!

892
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,200
It's a guest, it's a guest!

893
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,000
Sakes alive,
well, I'll be blessed

894
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,900
Wine's been poured,
and thank the Lord

895
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,800
I've had the napkins
freshly pressed

896
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,000
With dessert, she'll want tea

897
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,400
And, my dear,
that's fine with me

898
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,500
While the cups
do their soft-shoeing

899
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,400
I'll be bubbling,
I'll be brewing

900
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,100
I'll get warm, piping hot

901
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,100
Heaven's sake, is that a spot?

902
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,700
Clean it up, we want
the company impressed

903
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,800
We've got a lot to do

904
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,500
Is it one lump or two?

905
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,100
For you, our guest

906
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,200
She's our guest

907
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,500
She's our guest

908
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,900
She's our guest

909
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,900
People, fun's over,
over here, line up...

910
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,600
It's ten years since
we've had anybody here

911
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
And we're obsessed

912
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,700
With your meal, with your ease

913
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
Yes, indeed, we aim to please

914
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,700
While the candlelight's
still glowing

915
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,800
Let us help you,
we'll keep going

916
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,700
Course... by... course

917
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
One by one

918
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,100
Till you shout,
"Enough, I'm done!"

919
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,300
Then we'll sing you
off to sleep as you digest

920
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Tonight you'll prop
your feet up

921
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,700
But for now, let's eat up

922
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,800
Be our guest, be our guest

923
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,400
Be our guest

924
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:08,700
Please be our guest!

925
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,400
Bravo!

926
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,600
That was wonderful.

927
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,700
Thank you.

928
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,800
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

929
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,600
Good show, wasn't it?

930
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,900
Yes, everyone.

931
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,300
My goodness, look at the time.

932
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,900
Now it's off to bed,
off to bed.

933
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,300
Oh, I couldn't possibly
go to bed now.

934
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
It's my first time
in an enchanted castle.

935
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,200
Enchanted!

936
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Who said anything

937
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,000
about the castle
being enchanted?

938
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,100
It was you, wasn't it?

939
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,700
I figured it out for myself.

940
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,500
I'd like to look around,
if that's all right.

941
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,000
Oh, would you like a tour?

942
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,600
Wait a second, wait a second.

943
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,200
I'm not sure that's
such a good idea.

944
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,500
We can't let her
go poking around

945
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,400
in certain places,
if you know what I mean.

946
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,800
Perhaps you'd like to take me.

947
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,200
I'm sure you know everything

948
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,800
there is to know
about the castle.

949
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,700
Oh, well, actually, l, uh...

950
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,800
Yes, I do.

951
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,700
As you can see

952
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,600
the pseudo-facade
was stripped away

953
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,700
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design.

954
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,800
Note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings.

955
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,000
This is yet another example

956
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,000
of the late neoclassic
baroque period.

957
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,200
and, as I always say

958
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,300
if it's not baroque,
don't fix it.

959
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,800
Uh, where was I?

960
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,900
As you were.

961
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
Now, then, if I may
draw your attention

962
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,400
to the flying buttresses
above the...

963
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,800
Uh, Mademoiselle?

964
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
What's up there?

965
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Where? There?
Oh, nothing.

966
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,900
Absolutely nothing
of interest at all

967
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,100
in the west wing.

968
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,100
Dusty, dull, very boring.

969
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,600
Ah, so that's the west wing.

970
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,200
Nice going.

971
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,100
I wonder what
he's hiding up there?

972
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,900
Hiding?

973
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,300
The master is hiding nothing.

974
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,000
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.

975
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,400
Perhaps, uh,
Mademoiselle would like to

976
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,900
uh-uh, uh... see something else.

977
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,600
We have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to...

978
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
maybe later.

979
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,900
Th-The gardens or-or

980
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,700
the-the-the-the library,
perhaps.

981
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,800
You have a library?

982
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,300
Yes, oh, indeed.

983
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,400
With books.

984
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,600
Scads of books!

985
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,600
Mountains of books!

986
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Forests of books!

987
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
-Cascades!
-Longboats!

988
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Swamps of books!

989
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,300
More books than you'll

990
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,400
ever be able
to read in a lifetime.

991
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,700
Books on every subject ever
studied, by every author

992
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
who ever set pen to paper.

993
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,400
Oh!

994
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Why did you come here?

995
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,900
I'm... I'm sorry.

996
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,300
I warned you never to come here.

997
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,500
I didn't mean any harm.

998
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,100
Do you realize
what you could have done?!

999
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,100
Please, stop.

1000
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,800
Get out!

1001
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,400
No!

1002
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,300
Get... out!

1003
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,900
Where are you going?

1004
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,200
Promise or no promise

1005
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,900
I can't stay here
another minute.

1006
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,900
Oh, no, wait, please.

1007
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,100
Please wait.

1008
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,500
Oh!

1009
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,600
Oh!

1010
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,900
Here now.

1011
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,300
Oh, don't do that.

1012
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,000
Just hold still.

1013
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,200
That hurts!

1014
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,100
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

1015
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,400
Well, if you hadn't
have run away

1016
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,600
this wouldn't have happened!

1017
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,600
If you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away!

1018
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,300
Well, you shouldn't have
been in the west wing!

1019
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,400
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

1020
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,600
Now hold still.

1021
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,400
This might sting a little.

1022
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,300
Hmm?

1023
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,000
By the way, thank you.

1024
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,600
For saving my life.

1025
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,700
You're welcome.

1026
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,400
I don't usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night

1027
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,700
but he said you'd make it
worth my while.

1028
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,900
Ah.

1029
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,200
I'm listening.

1030
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,500
It's like this.

1031
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,600
I've got my heart set
on marrying Belle

1032
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,400
but she needs a little...
persuasion.

1033
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,600
Turned him down flat.

1034
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,200
Everyone knows
her father's a lunatic.

1035
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,100
He was in here tonight

1036
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,900
raving about a beast
in a castle.

1037
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,400
Maurice is harmless.

1038
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,000
The point is,
Belle would do anything

1039
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,300
to keep him
from being locked up.

1040
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,300
Yeah. Even marry him.

1041
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,000
So you want me

1042
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
to throw her father
into the asylum

1043
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,800
unless she agrees to marry you.

1044
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,300
Oh, that is despicable.

1045
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,400
I love it!

1046
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,100
If no one will help me

1047
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,800
then I'll go back alone.

1048
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,400
Yes, is that everything?

1049
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,200
I don't care what it takes.

1050
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,500
I'll find that castle,
and somehow

1051
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,300
I'll get her out of there.

1052
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,200
Belle? Maurice?

1053
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
Oh, well.

1054
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,800
I guess it's not going
to work after all.

1055
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,200
They have to come back sometime.

1056
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,700
And when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

1057
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,800
Lefou...

1058
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,800
don't move from that spot

1059
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,400
until Belle and
her father come home.

1060
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,300
But, but, I...

1061
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
Aw, nuts.

1062
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,200
I've never felt this way
about anyone.

1063
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,300
I want to do something for her.

1064
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,700
But what?

1065
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,700
Well, there's the usual things.

1066
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,900
Flowers, chocolates.

1067
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,700
Promises you don't intend
to keep.

1068
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,400
Ah, no, no.

1069
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,700
It has to be something
very special.

1070
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,800
Something that sparks
her interest.

1071
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,000
Wait a minute!

1072
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Belle, there's something
I want to show you.

1073
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,300
But first, you have
to close your eyes.

1074
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,500
It's a surprise.

1075
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,400
Can I open them?

1076
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,300
No, no. Not yet.

1077
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,800
Wait here.

1078
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,000
Now can I open them?

1079
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,600
All right.

1080
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,700
Now.

1081
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,100
I can't believe it!

1082
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,300
I've never seen so many books
in all my life!

1083
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,800
You-You like it?

1084
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,400
It's wonderful!

1085
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,200
Then it's yours.

1086
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200
Oh, thank you so much.

1087
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,700
Oh, would you look at that!

1088
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
I knew it would work.

1089
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,700
What? What worked?

1090
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,400
It's very encouraging.

1091
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,900
Isn't this exciting?

1092
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,300
I didn't see anything.

1093
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,400
Come along, Chip.

1094
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,000
There's chores to be done
in the kitchen.

1095
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,400
But what are they talking about?

1096
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,700
What's going on?
Come on, Mom.

1097
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,000
There's something sweet

1098
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,600
And almost kind

1099
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,100
But he was mean,
and he was coarse and unrefined

1100
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,800
And now he's dear, and so unsure

1101
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,300
I wonder why I didn't see it
there before

1102
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,900
She glanced this way

1103
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,400
I thought I saw

1104
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,100
And when we touched,
she didn't shudder at my paw

1105
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,500
No, it can't be

1106
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,500
I'll just ignore

1107
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,400
But then she's never looked
at me that way before

1108
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:30,600
New and a bit alarming

1109
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:38,700
Who'd have ever thought
that this could be?

1110
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:45,000
True that he's no
Prince Charming

1111
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,100
But there's something in him

1112
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,500
That I simply didn't see...

1113
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,400
Well, who'd have thought?

1114
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,300
Well, bless my soul

1115
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,300
Well, who'd have known?

1116
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,300
Well, who indeed?

1117
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,200
And who'd have guessed

1118
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,700
They'd come together
on their own?

1119
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,600
It's so peculiar

1120
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,600
We'll wait and see

1121
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,300
A few days more

1122
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,600
There may be something there
that wasn't there before...

1123
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,100
You know, perhaps there is

1124
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,200
Something there
that wasn't there before

1125
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,800
What?

1126
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,200
There may be something there
that wasn't there before.

1127
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,500
What's there, Mama?

1128
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,800
Shh!

1129
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,800
I'll tell you when you're older.

1130
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,600
Right, then!

1131
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,200
You all know why we're here.

1132
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,700
We have exactly 12 hours,
36 minutes and 15 seconds

1133
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,400
to create the most magical

1134
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,200
spontaneous, romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast.

1135
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,400
"Or beast..."

1136
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,600
Right.

1137
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,000
Need I remind you

1138
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,500
that if the last petal falls
from this rose

1139
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,500
the spell will never be...

1140
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,400
broken!

1141
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,700
Very well.

1142
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,700
You all know your assignments.

1143
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,500
Half of you to the west wing.

1144
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,300
Half of you to the east wing.

1145
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,200
The rest of you, come with me.

1146
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,800
Oh, lighten up, Cogs worth,
and let nature take its course.

1147
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,400
It's obvious there's
a spark between them.

1148
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,100
Yes, but there's no harm
in fanning the flames.

1149
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,800
You know... a little.

1150
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,800
Besides, they must fall in love

1151
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,500
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again.

1152
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,900
Ah, human again.

1153
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,400
Human again.

1154
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,400
Yes, think what that means.

1155
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,400
I'll be cooking again

1156
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,200
Be good looking again

1157
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,800
With a mademoiselle on each arm

1158
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,300
When I'm human again

1159
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,800
Only human again

1160
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,400
Poised and polished
and gleaming with charm

1161
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,900
I'll be courting again

1162
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,700
Chic and sporting again

1163
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,600
Which should cause
several husbands alarm

1164
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,100
Ha, ha!
I'll hop down off this shelf

1165
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,800
And tout de suite be myself

1166
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,800
I can't wait to be human again

1167
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,600
When we're human again

1168
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,300
Only human again

1169
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,100
When we're knickknacks
and whatnots no more

1170
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,800
When we're human again,
good and human again

1171
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,000
Oh, cherie,
won't it all be top drawer?

1172
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,800
I'll wear lipstick and rouge

1173
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,100
And I won't be so huge

1174
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,700
Why, I'll easily fit
through that door

1175
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,300
I'll exude savoir faire

1176
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
I'll wear gowns, I'll have hair

1177
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,300
It's my prayer to be human again

1178
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,400
When we're human again

1179
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,100
Only human again

1180
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,400
When the world once more
starts making sense

1181
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,900
I'll unwind, for a change

1182
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,500
Really? That'd be strange

1183
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,500
Can I help it if I'm t-t-tense?

1184
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,900
In a shack by the sea

1185
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,600
I'll sit back, sipping tea

1186
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,700
Let my early retirement commence

1187
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,300
Far from fools made of wax

1188
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,900
I'll get down to brass tacks
and relax!

1189
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,500
When I'm human again

1190
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,700
So sweep the dust from the floor

1191
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,100
Let's let some light in the room

1192
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,500
I can feel, I can tell

1193
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,500
Someone might break the spell
any day now

1194
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,300
Shine up the brass on the door

1195
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,000
Alert the dust pail and broom

1196
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,900
If it all goes as planned

1197
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,100
Our time may be at hand
any day now

1198
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,200
Open the shutters,
and let in some air

1199
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Put these here,
and put those over there

1200
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:29,100
Sweep up the years
of sadness and tears

1201
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,700
And throw them away

1202
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,900
We'll be human again

1203
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,900
Only human again

1204
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,600
When the girl
finally sets us all free

1205
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,000
Cheeks a-blooming again

1206
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,700
We're assuming again

1207
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,600
We'll resume our
long lost joie de vivre

1208
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,600
We'll be playing again

1209
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,800
Holidaying again

1210
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,900
And we're praying it's ASAP

1211
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
We will push, we will shove

1212
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,600
They will both fall in love

1213
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,300
And we'll finally
be human again...

1214
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,700
For never was a story
of more woe

1215
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,900
Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

1216
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,200
Could you read it again?

1217
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,200
Well, here, why don't
you read it to me?

1218
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,300
Uh, all right.

1219
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,000
Uh...

1220
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,200
Uh... I can't.

1221
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,800
You mean, you never learned?

1222
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,800
I learned... a little.

1223
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,500
It's just been so long.

1224
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,500
Well, here, I'll help you.

1225
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,000
Let's start here.

1226
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,700
Here.

1227
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
Okay, "Twoe..."

1228
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,400
"Two."

1229
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,400
"Two... I knew that.

1230
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,100
Two households..."

1231
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,000
We'll be dancing again

1232
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,500
We'll be twirling again

1233
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,800
We'll be whirling around
with such ease

1234
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,000
When we're human again

1235
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,600
Only human again

1236
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,200
We'll go waltzing
those old one, two, threes

1237
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
We'll be floating again

1238
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,100
We'll be gliding again

1239
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,700
Stepping, striding
as fine as you please

1240
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,800
Like a real human does

1241
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:13,200
I'll be all that I was

1242
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,500
On that glorious morn
when we're finally reborn

1243
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,800
And we're all

1244
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:25,900
Human again!

1245
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,400
Tonight is the night.

1246
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,900
I'm not sure I can do this.

1247
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,400
You don't have time to be timid.

1248
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,600
You must be bold, daring.

1249
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,300
Bold, daring.

1250
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,100
There will be music...

1251
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,400
romantic candlelight...

1252
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,300
provided by myself.

1253
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,600
And when the moment is right

1254
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,300
you confess your love.

1255
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,200
Yes, I con...

1256
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,000
l-I... No, I can't.

1257
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,300
You care for the girl,
don't you?

1258
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,500
More than anything.

1259
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,000
Well, then,
you must tell her.

1260
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,300
Voila!

1261
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,500
Oh, you look so... so...

1262
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,300
Stupid.

1263
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,400
Not quite the word
I was looking for.

1264
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,200
Perhaps a little more
off the top?

1265
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,600
Your lady awaits.

1266
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,800
Tale as old as time

1267
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,900
True as it can be

1268
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,200
Barely even friends

1269
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,600
Then somebody bends

1270
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,700
Unexpectedly

1271
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,800
Just a little change

1272
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,200
Small, to say the least

1273
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,700
Both a little scared

1274
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,600
Neither one prepared

1275
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,300
Beauty and the Beast

1276
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,700
Ever just the same

1277
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,100
Ever a surprise

1278
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,100
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1279
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,700
Ever as before

1280
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,000
Ever just as sure

1281
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,300
As the sun will rise

1282
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,300
Tale as old as time

1283
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,600
Tune as old as song

1284
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,600
Bittersweet and strange

1285
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,900
Finding you can change

1286
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,700
Learning you were wrong

1287
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:10,000
Certain as the sun

1288
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,700
Rising in the east

1289
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,700
Tale as old as time

1290
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,300
Song as old as rhyme

1291
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,200
Beauty and the Beast

1292
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,800
Shh!

1293
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,400
Tale as old as time

1294
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,400
Song as old as rhyme

1295
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:37,300
Beauty and the Beast.

1296
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,500
Off to the cupboard
with you now, Chip.

1297
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,500
It's past your bedtime.

1298
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,800
Good night, love.

1299
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,100
Belle?

1300
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,300
Are you... happy here with me?

1301
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,000
Yes.

1302
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,100
What is it?

1303
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,700
If only I could see
my father again

1304
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,200
just for a moment.

1305
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,500
I miss him so much.

1306
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,700
There is a way.

1307
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,100
This mirror will show
you anything...

1308
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,400
anything you wish to see.

1309
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,100
I'd like to see my father,
please.

1310
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,600
Papa?

1311
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,800
Oh, no.

1312
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,000
He's sick.

1313
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,500
He may be dying
and he's all alone.

1314
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,700
Then, you must go to him.

1315
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,700
What did you say?

1316
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,700
I release you.

1317
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,200
You are no longer my prisoner.

1318
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,600
You mean... I'm free?

1319
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Yes.

1320
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,700
Oh, thank you.

1321
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,700
Hold on, Papa.

1322
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,900
I'm on my way.

1323
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,500
Take it with you

1324
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,900
so you'll always have
a way to look back

1325
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,400
and remember me.

1326
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,800
Thank you for understanding
how much he needs me.

1327
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,100
Well, Your Highness, I must say

1328
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,700
everything is going
just swimmingly.

1329
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,600
I knew you had it in you.

1330
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,000
I let her go.

1331
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Yes, yes.

1332
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,700
Splen...

1333
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,400
You what?

1334
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,800
How could you do that?

1335
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,200
I had to.

1336
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,800
Yes, but...

1337
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,000
Why?

1338
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:06,600
Because... I love her.

1339
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,000
He did what?

1340
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,100
Yes.

1341
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,700
I'm afraid it's true.

1342
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,100
She's going away?

1343
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,100
But he was so close.

1344
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,500
After all this time,
he's finally learned to love.

1345
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,900
That's it, then.
That should break the spell.

1346
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,300
But it's not enough.

1347
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,700
She has to love him in return.

1348
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,800
Now it's too late.

1349
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,300
Papa! Papa!

1350
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,400
Ooh.

1351
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,500
They're back.

1352
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,700
Belle?

1353
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,700
Shh.

1354
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,100
It's all right, Papa.

1355
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,100
I'm home.

1356
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,200
I thought I'd never

1357
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,800
see you again.

1358
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,500
I missed you so much.

1359
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,400
But the Beast?

1360
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,300
Did you... how did you escape?

1361
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,500
I didn't escape, Papa.

1362
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,700
He let me go.

1363
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,000
That horrible beast?

1364
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
But he's different now, Papa.

1365
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,100
He's changed somehow.

1366
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,000
Hi.

1367
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,900
Oh. A stowaway.

1368
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,100
Why, hello there, little fella.

1369
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,800
Didn't think I'd see you again.

1370
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,200
Belle, why'd you go away?

1371
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,700
Don't you like us anymore?

1372
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,700
Oh, Chip, of course I do.

1373
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,600
It's just...

1374
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,400
May I help you?

1375
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,300
I've come to collect
your father.

1376
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,700
My father?

1377
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,600
Don't worry, Mademoiselle.

1378
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,800
We'll take good care of him.

1379
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,000
My father's not crazy.

1380
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,700
He was raving like a lunatic.

1381
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,500
We all heard him, didn't we?

1382
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,700
No, I won't let you.

1383
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,700
Belle?

1384
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,300
Maurice, tell us again, old man.

1385
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,200
Just how big was the beast?

1386
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,200
He was... I mean, he was...
he was... enormous.

1387
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,800
l-I'd say at least eight...

1388
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,100
No, more like ten feet.

1389
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:18,100
Well, you don't get
much crazier than that.

1390
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,100
It's true, I tell you.

1391
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Get him out of here.

1392
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,200
Let go of me.

1393
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,300
No!

1394
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,300
You can't do this.

1395
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,100
Poor Belle.

1396
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,600
It's a shame about your father.

1397
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,400
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.

1398
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,200
Hmm, I might be able
to clear up this...

1399
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,800
little misunderstanding.

1400
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,800
lf...

1401
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,600
If what?

1402
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,500
If you marry me.

1403
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,300
What?

1404
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,000
One little word, Belle.
That's all it takes.

1405
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:43,900
Never.

1406
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,500
Have it your way.

1407
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,300
Belle.

1408
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,300
Let go of me.

1409
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,900
My father's not crazy
and I can prove it.

1410
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,000
Show me the Beast.

1411
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,500
Is it dangerous?

1412
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,900
Oh, no, no,
he'd never hurt anyone.

1413
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:06,200
Please, I know he looks vicious,
but he's really kind and gentle.

1414
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,600
He's my friend.

1415
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,700
If I didn't know better

1416
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,200
I'd think you had feelings
for this monster.

1417
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,700
He's no monster, Gaston.
You are.

1418
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,600
She's as crazy as the old man.

1419
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,700
The Beast will make off
with your children.

1420
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,500
-He'll come after them
in the night.
-No!

1421
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,400
We're not safe

1422
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,000
till his head
is mounted on my wall.

1423
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,700
I say we kill the Beast!

1424
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,300
We're not safe until he's dead

1425
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,900
He'll come stalking us at night

1426
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,600
Set to sacrifice our children

1427
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,300
To his monstrous appetite

1428
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,000
He'll wreak havoc on our village

1429
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,500
If we let him wander free

1430
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:40,200
So it's time to take
some action, boys

1431
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:45,100
It's time to follow me

1432
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,200
Through the mist,
through the woods

1433
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,900
Through the darkness
and the shadows

1434
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,200
It's a nightmare,
but it's one exciting ride

1435
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,600
Say a prayer, then we're there
at the drawbridge of a castle

1436
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,800
And there's something
truly terrible inside

1437
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,200
It's a beast, he's got fangs,
razor-sharp ones

1438
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,500
Massive paws, killer claws
for the feast

1439
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,300
Hear him roar, see him foam

1440
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,900
But we're not coming home

1441
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,300
Till he's dead

1442
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,900
Good and dead

1443
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,900
Kill the Beast!

1444
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,500
No, I won't let you do this.

1445
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,000
If you're not with us,
you're against us.

1446
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,900
Bring the old man.

1447
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,400
Get your hands off me.

1448
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,800
We can't have them running off
to warn the creature.

1449
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,000
Let us out!

1450
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,600
We'll rid the village
of this beast.

1451
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,600
Who's with me?

1452
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,000
Raise your torch,
mount your horse

1453
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,200
Screw your courage
to the sticking place

1454
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,500
We're counting on Gaston
to lead the way

1455
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,200
Through the mist,
through the wood

1456
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,700
Where, within a haunted castle

1457
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,300
Something's lurking
that you don't see every day

1458
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,700
It's a beast,
one as tall as a mountain

1459
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,700
We won't rest
till he's good and deceased

1460
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,300
Sally forth, tally ho

1461
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,800
Grab your sword, grab your bow

1462
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,300
Praise the Lord, and here we go.

1463
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,600
We'll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head!

1464
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,700
I have to warn the Beast.

1465
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,500
This is all my fault.

1466
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,400
Oh, Papa, what are
we going to do?

1467
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,600
Now, now.

1468
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,000
We'll think of something.

1469
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,000
Ah!

1470
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,200
We don't like
what we don't understand

1471
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,700
In fact, it scares us

1472
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,300
And this monster
is mysterious at least

1473
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,600
Bring your guns,
bring your knives

1474
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,100
Save your children
and your wives

1475
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,100
We'll save our village
and our lives

1476
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,400
We'll kill the Beast!

1477
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,700
I knew it.

1478
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,100
I knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up.

1479
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,700
Maybe it would have been better
if she'd never come at all.

1480
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,000
Could it be?

1481
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,700
Is it she?

1482
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,100
Sacre bleu!

1483
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Invaders.

1484
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,300
Encroachers.

1485
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,600
And they have the mirror.

1486
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,600
Warn the master.

1487
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
If it's a fight they want,
we'll be ready for them.

1488
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,400
Who's with me?

1489
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,300
Ah!

1490
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,300
Take whatever booty you can find

1491
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,300
but remember, the Beast is mine!

1492
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,900
Lights ablaze, banners high

1493
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,500
We go marching into battle

1494
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,100
Unafraid, although
the danger just increased

1495
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,700
Raise the flag, sing the song

1496
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,000
Here we come, we're 50 strong

1497
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,400
And 50 Frenchmen can't be wrong

1498
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,100
Let's kill the Beast!

1499
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,900
-Pardon me, Master?
-Leave me in peace.

1500
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,200
But, sir, the castle
is under attack.

1501
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,300
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1502
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,000
This isn't working.

1503
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,300
Oh, Lumiere,
we must do something.

1504
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,700
Wait, I know.

1505
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,600
What shall we do, Master?

1506
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,000
It doesn't matter now.

1507
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,900
Just let them come.

1508
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,100
Kill the Beast!
Kill the Beast!

1509
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,100
Kill the Beast!

1510
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:40,900
Now!

1511
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,800
Yes!

1512
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,700
Here we go.

1513
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,300
What the devil?

1514
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,500
Belle, look out!

1515
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,500
You guys got to try this thing.

1516
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,800
Up here you scurvy scum! Now!

1517
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,900
Oh!

1518
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,300
And stay out!

1519
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,600
Eww!

1520
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,900
Get up.

1521
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,800
Get up!

1522
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,300
What's the matter, Beast?

1523
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,800
Too kind and gentle
to fight back?

1524
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,200
No!

1525
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,300
Belle...

1526
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,600
No! Gaston, don't!

1527
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,700
Let's go, Philippe.

1528
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,200
Come on out and fight!

1529
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Were you in love with her,
Beast?

1530
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,100
Did you honestly think
she'd want you

1531
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,300
when she had someone like me?

1532
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,000
It's over, Beast.

1533
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,600
Belle is mine!

1534
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,200
Let me go. Let me go.

1535
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,900
Please, don't hurt me.

1536
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,800
I'll do anything.

1537
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,400
Anything!

1538
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,500
Get out.

1539
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,600
Beast!

1540
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,700
Belle?

1541
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,200
Belle?

1542
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,700
You came back.

1543
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,300
You...

1544
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,700
You came back.

1545
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,400
Of course I came back.

1546
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,000
I couldn't let them...

1547
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,800
Oh, this is all my fault.

1548
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,200
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

1549
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,500
Maybe... it's better...

1550
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,600
it's better this way.

1551
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,900
Don't talk like that.

1552
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,300
You'll be all right.

1553
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,700
We're together now.

1554
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,000
Everything's going to be fine.

1555
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,000
You'll see.

1556
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,200
And... at least...

1557
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,700
I got to see you...

1558
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,300
one last time.

1559
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,800
No. No.

1560
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:36,700
Please... Please...

1561
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,500
Please, don't leave me.

1562
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,200
I love you.

1563
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,500
Belle.

1564
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,100
It's me.

1565
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,000
It is you.

1566
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,700
Lumiere.

1567
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,200
Cogs worth!

1568
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,300
Mrs. Potts!

1569
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,300
Look at us.

1570
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,900
Mama, Mama.

1571
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,100
My goodness.

1572
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,900
It is a miracle.

1573
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,300
L'amour.

1574
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,100
Well, Lumiere, old friend.

1575
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,300
Shall we let bygones be bygones?

1576
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,200
Of course, mon ami.

1577
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,800
I told you she would
break the spell.

1578
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:45,400
I beg your pardon, old friend

1579
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,500
but I believe I told you.

1580
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,200
No, you didn't... I told you.

1581
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,700
You most certainly did not

1582
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,000
you pompous,
paraffin-headed pea brain.

1583
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,500
En garde, you-you
overgrown pocket watch.

1584
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,600
Take that.

1585
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:04,100
Are they going to live
happily ever after, Mama?

1586
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,800
Of course, my dear.

1587
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,900
Of course.

1588
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,900
Do I still have
to sleep in the cupboard?

1589
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:19,300
Certain as the sun

1590
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,300
Rising in the east

1591
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,000
Tale as old as time

1592
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,100
Song as old as rhyme

1593
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:32,400
Beauty and the Beast

1594
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,500
Tale as old as time

1595
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,800
Song as old as rhyme

1596
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:44,200
Beauty and the Beast.

1597
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:02,500
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

1598
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:12,500
Tale as old as time

1599
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:17,800
True as it can be

1600
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,100
Barely even friends

1601
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,900
Then somebody bends

1602
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:29,700
Unexpectedly

1603
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:35,700
Just a little change

1604
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,600
Small to say the least

1605
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,400
Both a little scared

1606
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,600
Neither one prepared

1607
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:49,700
Beauty and the Beast

1608
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:55,800
Ever just the same

1609
01:20:55,400 --> 01:21:01,700
Ever a surprise

1610
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,600
Ever as before

1611
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,400
And ever just as sure

1612
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:12,100
As the sun will rise

1613
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,100
Whoa, oh-oh

1614
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,800
Whoa, oh

1615
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,500
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

1616
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:43,000
Ever just the same

1617
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:48,400
Ever a surprise

1618
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,000
Ever as before

1619
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,800
Ever just as sure

1620
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:58,000
As the sun will rise

1621
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:03,100
Oh, oh, oh...

1622
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:09,300
Tale as old as time

1623
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:15,000
Tune as old as song

1624
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Bittersweet and strange

1625
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,400
Finding you can change

1626
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:26,500
Learning you were wrong

1627
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:29,400
Certain as the sun

1628
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,500
Certain as the sun

1629
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:35,300
Rising in the east

1630
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,800
Tale as old as time

1631
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,600
Song as old as rhyme

1632
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:46,700
Beauty and the Beast

1633
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,700
Tale as old as time

1634
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,100
Song as old as rhyme

1635
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:03,900
Beauty and the Beast

1636
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,900
Oh, oh-oh-oh

1637
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,600
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

1638
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:19,000
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm

1639
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:36,100
Beauty and the Beast.
