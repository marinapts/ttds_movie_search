1
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,080
Craig, honey, it's time for bed.

2
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,960
<i>Craig, honey, time to get up.</i>

3
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Craig, honey, time to get up.

4
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,120
I'm sorry. I didn't know Orrin Hatch
was out of his cage.

5
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,160
- Come here. Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

6
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,960
What are you gonna do today, honey?

7
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,800
Working in the workshop.

8
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,680
I was thinking, maybe you'd feel better
if you got a job.

9
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
We've been over this.

10
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,720
Nobody's looking for a puppeteer
in today's wintry economic climate.

11
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I know, honey, but I thought, you know...

12
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,480
...maybe something else
until this puppet thing turns around.

13
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,440
Derek Mantini doesn't need a day job.

14
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,880
Not everybody can be Derek Mantini.

15
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,400
I gotta get to the shop. We have
a shipment of kitty litter coming in.

16
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,440
Will you do me a favor?
Will you take a look at Elijah today?

17
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,200
- He's not feeling very good again.
- Which one is Elijah again?

18
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,840
- The chimp, honey.
- Yeah, okay.

19
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,760
<i>On the lighter side of the news
in Westchester County today...</i>

20
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,400
<i>... puppeteer Derek Mantini
thrilled onlookers as he performed...</i>

21
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,560
<i>...The Belle of Amherst
with a 60-foot Emily Dickinson puppet.</i>

22
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
<i>"How dreary to be somebody!"</i>

23
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,640
<i>"How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day"</i>

24
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Gimmicky bastard.

25
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,240
You don't know how lucky you are,
being a monkey.

26
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,680
Because consciousness...

27
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,440
...is a terrible curse.

28
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,600
I think, I feel, I suffer.

29
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,360
And all I ask in return
is the opportunity to do my work.

30
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,880
And they won't allow it...

31
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,560
...because I raise issues.

32
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,760
<i>While we enjoyed the pleasures
of an uneasy love...</i>

33
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
<i>... and abandoned ourselves to fornication...</i>

34
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,080
<i>... we were spared God's severity.</i>

35
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,400
<i>Say no more, I beg you,
and cease from complaints like these...</i>

36
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,320
<i>... which are so far-removed
from the true depths of love.</i>

37
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,600
Look, a puppet show!

38
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,200
Okay, honey, just for a minute.
Mommy's waiting.

39
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,400
<i>Even during the celebration of Mass
when our prayers should be pure...</i>

40
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,400
<i>... lewd visions of these pleasures
take such a hold upon my unhappy soul...</i>

41
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,920
<i>... that my thoughts are
on their very wantonness...</i>

42
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,320
<i>... instead of my prayers.</i>

43
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,920
<i>Sometimes my thoughts are betrayed...</i>

44
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
<i>... by the movement of my body.</i>

45
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,680
<i>I took my fill
of my wretched pleasures in you...</i>

46
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,880
<i>... and this was the sum total of my love.</i>

47
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,840
You motherfucker!

48
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,480
Oh, Craig!

49
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,280
Honey, not again!

50
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,440
Why do you do this to yourself, honey?

51
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm a puppeteer.

52
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,800
Seven and a half, right?

53
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,840
- Yeah.
- I'll take you through it.

54
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,200
Seven and a half.

55
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,040
Thank you.

56
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,200
Welcome to Lestercorp.
How may we meet your filing needs?

57
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,880
No. My name's Craig Schwartz.

58
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,440
I have an interview with Dr. Lester.

59
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,800
- Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez.
- Schwartz.

60
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
- Pardon?
- Schwartz.

61
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're saying to me right now.

62
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,480
- My name is Schwartz.
- "My name is Warts."

63
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,000
Mr. Juarez?

64
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,120
Yes?

65
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,480
- Chest?
- I said, "Yes".

66
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,480
You suggest what?

67
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm sorry. I have no time for piddling
suggestions from mumbling job applicants.

68
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,160
Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now.

69
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,440
Come in, Mr. Juarez.

70
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,960
My name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.

71
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,920
Security!

72
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,120
No, sir, it's just a little mix-up
with your secretary.

73
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,120
My name is Craig Schwartz.
I tried to explain that to her.

74
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,040
She's not my secretary.

75
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,680
She's what they call an executive liaison.

76
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,600
And I am not banging her,
if that's what you're implying.

77
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,520
No, sir, not at all.
I think I must have simply misspoke.

78
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,480
Well, now, tell me, Dr. Schwartz...

79
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,920
...what do you feel
you can bring to Lestercorp?

80
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

81
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,440
Are you? All right. Let's see about that.

82
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,000
Which of these two letters comes first?
This one or this one?

83
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,600
The symbol on the left is not a letter, sir.

84
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,520
Damn, you're good.

85
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,960
- I was trying to trick you.
- I see.

86
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,800
- Well then, put these in order.
- Yes, sir.

87
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,960
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.

88
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,720
<i>Yes, sir. Genghis Khan Capone. Fine.</i>

89
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,120
Damn fine woman, Floris.

90
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,360
I don't know how she puts up
with this speech impediment of mine.

91
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,760
You don't have a speech impediment,
Dr. Lester.

92
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,640
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy.

93
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,640
I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on that one.

94
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,520
You see, she's got her doctorate...

95
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,400
...in Speech Impedimentology
from Case Western.

96
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,000
I apologize if you can't understand
a word I'm saying.

97
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,720
No, I understand perfectly.

98
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
It's very kind of you to lie.

99
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,040
You see, I've been very Ionely...

100
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,080
...in my isolated tower
of indecipherable speech.

101
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,640
You got the job.

102
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,680
- Any questions?
- Well, just one.

103
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,000
Why are these ceilings so low?

104
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,320
Low overhead, my boy!
We pass the savings on to you.

105
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,960
But seriously, that'll all be covered
in orientation.

106
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,880
<i>Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor
of the Mertin-Flemmer building.</i>

107
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,160
<i>As you'll now be spending
your workday here...</i>

108
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,240
<i>... it's important that you learn a bit
about the history of this famous floor.</i>

109
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
<i>- Hello, Don.
- Hello, Wendy.</i>

110
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
<i>Don, I was wondering, do you know why...</i>

111
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,680
<i>... our workplace has such low ceilings?</i>

112
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,480
<i>It's an interesting story.
Many years ago in the late 1800s...</i>

113
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,160
<i>... James Mertin, an Irish ship captain,
came to this town...</i>

114
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,760
<i>... and decided to erect an office building.</i>

115
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,200
<i>He called this building the Mertin-Flemmer
building after himself and...</i>

116
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,360
<i>... someone else, who local legend
has it was named Flemmer.</i>

117
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,680
<i>Well, one day, old Captain Mertin received
an unexpected visitor.</i>

118
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,360
<i>- Captain Mertin?
- Aye. What want ye, girl child?</i>

119
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,360
<i>I'm not a child, but rather an adult lady
of miniature proportions.</i>

120
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,720
<i>I see. Well, if it's charity you're after...</i>

121
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,280
<i>... be gone with ye, you foul demon!</i>

122
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
<i>I'm not asking for alms, Captain...</i>

123
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,160
<i>... but, rather, the ear of a kind man
with a noble heart.</i>

124
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,880
<i>Well, speak then, if you must.</i>

125
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,640
<i>Captain Mertin, I'm afraid that the world
was not built with me in mind.</i>

126
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,440
<i>Doorknobs are too high,
chairs are unwieldy...</i>

127
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,280
<i>... and high-ceilinged rooms
mock my stature.</i>

128
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,240
<i>Why cannot there be a place for me
to work that's safe and comfortable?</i>

129
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,800
<i>Thy story has moved me like no other.</i>

130
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,400
<i>Therefore, I shall make ye me wife.</i>

131
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,840
<i>And I shall build a floor for ye...</i>

132
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,640
<i>... between the seventh and the eighth
in me own building...</i>

133
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,240
<i>... so at least there'll be one place
on God's green earth...</i>

134
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
<i>... where ye and your accursed kind
can live in peace.</i>

135
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,800
<i>So that's the story of 7 1/2.</i>

136
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,280
<i>Since the rents are considerably lower,
this floor has been adopted...</i>

137
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,760
<i>... by businesses which have been forced
to cut corners.</i>

138
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,640
<i>After all, the overhead is low.</i>

139
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,160
Moving story, huh?

140
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,120
Unfortunately, the story's bullshit.

141
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,440
Listen, I'm Craig Schwartz.
I'm just starting out at Lestercorp.

142
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,920
Where are you starting out?

143
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,160
<i>Shut up! Shut up!</i>

144
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,280
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Hey, shut up!

145
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,680
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry, honey.

146
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,800
Sorry, honey.

147
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,880
Sorry, honey.

148
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,920
- Shut up!
- Sorry!

149
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,640
- Help! She's locking me in a cage.
- Isn't that cute?

150
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,360
- I just taught him that today.
- Yeah, that's adorable.

151
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,680
- You want to do some dishes for me?
- Put that down.

152
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Here, Elijah. Here you go.

153
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,040
You know, I have an appointment
tomorrow with Elijah's shrink.

154
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,640
I think we're finally getting down
to the bottom...

155
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,320
...of this acid stomach, aren't we?
Come here.

156
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,160
Get down from the...

157
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,960
She thinks that it's some sort
of childhood trauma.

158
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,120
Feelings of inadequacy as a chimp,
you know?

159
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,320
Careful. Isn't that interesting?

160
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,120
I find it really interesting.

161
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,840
So, honey, have you thought any more
about us having a baby?

162
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,480
I think it's just so tough right now,
economically and all...

163
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,080
...that I think maybe we should just wait
and see if this job thing pays off.

164
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,840
You know?

165
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,680
I was thinking about what you said
the other day...

166
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,040
...about the orientation film being bullshit.
- Yes?

167
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,960
I think maybe you're on to something.

168
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,920
- And 50 other lines to get in a girl's pants.
- No, no!

169
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,480
No, I was just talking about the film.

170
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,160
Here's the thing.

171
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:25,240
If you ever got me, you wouldn't
have a clue what to do with me.

172
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,480
I wasn't. I was talking about the film.

173
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,800
What magic those fingers could work
on the right cabinet.

174
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,520
Maybe you could alphabetize me.

175
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,920
And don't forget...

176
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,760
..."I" comes before "U".

177
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,400
Floris, I think you're very nice...

178
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,800
...but the truth is that I'm in love
with someone else.

179
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

180
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,600
- You bastard.
- What?

181
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,600
- Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.
- No.

182
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,480
If I was 80 years younger, I'd box your ears.

183
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,680
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I wouldn't...

184
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,480
- Pardon me. How old are you, sir?
- 105.

185
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,040
Carrot juice, and lots of it.

186
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,760
I swear, sometimes it's not worth it.
I piss orange.

187
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,720
And I have to piss sitting down...

188
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,280
...like a goddamn girly-girl,
every 15 minutes.

189
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,280
But nobody wants to die.

190
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,400
To be a young man again.

191
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,280
Maybe then Floris would care for me.

192
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,600
The elderly have so much to offer.
They're our link with history.

193
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't wanna be your goddamn link,
damn ya.

194
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,880
I want to feel Floris's naked thighs
next to mine.

195
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,200
I want my body to inspire lust...

196
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,800
...in that beautiful, complex woman.

197
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,760
I want her to shiver
with a spasm of ecstasy...

198
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,880
...as I penetrate her wet...

199
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,520
Dr. Lester, while I'm flattered
you would share your feelings with me...

200
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,960
...the workplace isn't the most suitable
environment for this type of discussion.

201
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,720
You're right. I'll tell you what.

202
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,680
Meet me after work today
at Jerry's Juiceteria on Lex...

203
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,840
...and I'll spill my goddamn guts for ya.

204
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,040
No, I won't be late, Lotte.
I just have to, you know...

205
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,720
...listen to Lester's sexual fantasies
and drink carrot juice for a while.

206
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,080
It's a job thing, really.

207
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,840
So, I'll talk to you later, okay?
Yeah. You, too.

208
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,520
Gotta go back to work. Okay, bye.

209
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,240
Hi. Do you know that I don't even know
your name or where you work?

210
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,960
Yeah.

211
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,440
How about this?

212
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,200
If I can guess your name in three tries,
you have to have a drink with me tonight.

213
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
Why not?

214
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,840
Okay.

215
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,880
You look like a...

216
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,800
...Bar...

217
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,720
...Ru...

218
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,680
...Bell...

219
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,520
...Carol...

220
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,320
...Ta, Cher...

221
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,640
...Susan...

222
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,320
...Emily...

223
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,080
...Marlar...

224
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,280
...Maxine. Maxine?

225
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,800
Yeah! Who told you?

226
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,680
Nobody told me.
That just came out. Isn't that odd?

227
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,360
So where do you live and stuff?

228
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,120
I am dubious...

229
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,880
...but I don't welsh.

230
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,720
Okay, meet me at The Stuck Pig, 7:00.

231
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
If you're late, I walk.

232
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,120
Nubile. Blonde.

233
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,840
Wet with desire. Me in leather.

234
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,320
A harness, if you like.

235
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,840
And all eyes, Craig,
are upon me as I speak.

236
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,720
"Ladies", I begin.

237
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,520
"I am the love god Eros." They like that.

238
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,440
"I intoxicate you."

239
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,440
"My spunk is, to you, manna from heaven."

240
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,480
Dr. Lester, this is all really fascinating
and stuff...

241
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,280
...but I gotta get back home to my wife.

242
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,920
- You have a wife. I'd like to meet her.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,760
Shall we say dinner Thursday?

244
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,760
You can come, too, if you like.

245
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,200
Get that? That was a joke.
You hear what I said? You can come, too.

246
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,800
That was a good one.

247
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,600
- All right. Thank you.
- Yeah.

248
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,080
Maxine.

249
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
- I made it, Maxine.
- Just.

250
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,400
Buy you a drink, Maxine?

251
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,480
Are you married?

252
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,720
- Yeah. But enough about me.
- Yeah.

253
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,480
- What'll you have?
- I'll have more of the same, please, Barry.

254
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,960
And I'll have a light beer, or something.

255
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,080
So...

256
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,360
I don't know, I like you.

257
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,080
- I don't know what it is about you. I just...
- My tits?

258
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,440
- No!
- No?

259
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,000
It's your energy,
the way you carry yourself.

260
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,600
You're not a fag, are you?

261
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,600
No. I am really attracted to you.

262
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,080
"I am really attracted to you."
You are a fag.

263
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,280
Well, we can share recipes, Darlene.

264
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,120
- Wait! I love your tits. I wanna fuck 'em.
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.

265
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,040
Not a chance.

266
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,240
So tell me about yourself.

267
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,320
If you can get your mind
out of the gutter long enough, dog boy.

268
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,480
Well, I'm a puppeteer.

269
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,680
- I've been...
- Check.

270
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,560
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Lester just wouldn't let me get away.

271
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,960
Hi, Elijah. We're supposed to have dinner
with him on Thursday...

272
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,160
...but I can get us out of it, if you want.

273
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,000
It's amazing. He's like this insane old lech,
and it's kind of amusing...

274
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,760
...once you get past
how disgusting it actually is.

275
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,920
- Did you eat?
- No. I'm not hungry.

276
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm sorry I didn't call.
It was just hard to get away.

277
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,560
- I was worried.
- I'm sorry.

278
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,520
You know...

279
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,520
...you wanted me to work.

280
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,600
How was your evening?

281
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,120
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.

282
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,200
- The ferret?
- The iguana.

283
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,040
So I just dressed the wound...

284
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,440
...and I've just been feeding everyone
and putting everybody to bed.

285
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,160
- You want a beer?
- No. I think I'm going to go to bed.

286
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,600
Elijah's gonna sleep with us tonight.

287
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,880
- I don't think he's feeling very well.
- Okay.

288
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,840
You know what? I'm gonna go
in my workshop for a little while.

289
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,960
- But I'll be in in a little while.
- Okay.

290
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,360
Tell me, why do you love puppeteering?

291
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,480
Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.

292
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,840
Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
someone else for a little while.

293
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,440
Being inside another skin...

294
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,600
...thinking differently, moving differently...

295
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,280
...feeling differently.

296
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,840
Interesting, Craig.

297
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,640
Would you like to be inside my skin...

298
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,800
...think what I think, feel what I feel?

299
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,040
More than anything, Maxine.

300
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,760
It's good in here, Craig.

301
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,960
It's better than your wildest dreams.

302
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,840
<i>You're not somebody
I could get interested in.</i>

303
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,920
You play with dolls.

304
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,520
Puppets, Maxine.

305
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,760
It's the idea of being inside
someone else's skin...

306
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,400
...and seeing what they see
and feeling what they feel.

307
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,720
Yikes!

308
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,240
It's just that, well...
Please, let me explain.

309
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,640
I've never done this before, but...

310
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,960
...I feel something for you,
and I've never felt this way before...

311
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,840
...you know, about anybody,
not even my wife.

312
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,680
And I just...

313
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,320
I really feel that you and I belong together.

314
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
Shit.

315
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,360
What's the file number?

316
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,080
You know what?
The puppeteer told me he loved me today.

317
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,080
I know. I can't think
of anything more pathetic.

318
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,880
I'm sorry.

319
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,440
Afternoon, sir.

320
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,000
The Broadhurst Theatre, please.

321
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,480
Say, ain't you that actor guy?

322
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,440
Yes.

323
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,200
John, what is, John...

324
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,600
Don't tell me. Maplethorpe?

325
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,880
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich. Right.

326
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,560
Yeah. I thought you were all right
in that one movie.

327
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,960
Thank you.

328
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,320
The one where you played a jewel thief.

329
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,840
- I never played a jewel thief.
- No?

330
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,720
- Who am I thinkin' of?
- I don't know.

331
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,680
No, no, I'm pretty sure it was you.

332
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,600
Yeah. Absolutely, doll.

333
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,560
I'm just about to close up.
Wanna meet at The Pig in 20 minutes?

334
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,000
Cool. Bye.

335
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,400
I'm splittin' for the day, puppet man.
Lock up for me, okay?

336
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,720
Don't you wanna know
what happened to me?

337
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,600
No.

338
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,000
- Please, this is important.
- Better be.

339
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,640
It is.

340
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,600
There's a tiny door in my office, Maxine.

341
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,080
It's a portal, and it takes you
inside John Malkovich.

342
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,680
You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes...

343
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,240
...and then after 15 minutes,
you're spit out...

344
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,960
...into a ditch on the side
of the New Jersey Turnpike.

345
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,320
Sounds great!
Who the fuck is John Malkovich?

346
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,000
He's an actor. He's one of the great
American actors of the 20th century.

347
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,320
Oh, yeah? What's he been in?

348
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,600
Lots of things. That jewel thief movie.

349
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
He's very well-respected.
Anyway, the point is...

350
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,840
...this is a very odd thing.

351
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,760
It's supernatural, for lack of a better word.

352
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,160
I mean, it raises all sorts
of philosophical-type questions...

353
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,640
...about the nature of self,
about the existence of a soul.

354
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,480
You know, am I me?
Is Malkovich Malkovich?

355
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
I had a piece of wood in my hand, Maxine.

356
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,200
I don't have it any more. Where is it?

357
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,520
Did it disappear? How could that be?

358
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,080
Is it still in Malkovich's head?
I don't know!

359
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Do you see what a metaphysical
can of worms this portal is?

360
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,160
I don't see how I could go on living my life
the way I've lived it before.

361
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,640
Yeah?

362
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,600
<i>So I've been thinking,
is this Malkovich fellow appealing?</i>

363
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,880
Maxine! Yes, of course, Maxine.
He's a celebrity.

364
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,920
<i>Good. We'll sell tickets.</i>

365
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,880
<i>- Tickets to Malkovich?
- Exactly.</i>

366
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,280
<i>$200 a pop.</i>

367
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,440
But, Maxine, there's something,
I don't know, like, profound here.

368
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,840
I don't know if we should exploit it.
You think?

369
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,360
<i>I need you for this, Craigy.
You're my man on the inside.</i>

370
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,480
You need me? I'm your man?

371
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,920
<i>Sure, whatever.</i>

372
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,520
Hey everybody, I'm home.

373
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,000
- Treats for everyone.
- Maxine?

374
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,320
<i>- Yeah?
- We don't know the significance of this.</i>

375
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,640
It might be dangerous to toy with?

376
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,480
<i>I'll protect you, doll face.</i>

377
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,040
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

378
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,640
Who was that?

379
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,080
I'm going to be working a lot of late nights
with this partner...

380
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,960
...'cause Lestercorp's open during the day,
so I'll be working a lot of nights.

381
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,000
It's a good thing. It'll get us
out of the hole financially...

382
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
...'cause we're gonna turn it
into a business.

383
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,120
But I don't understand.

384
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,560
There's no such thing as a hole,
or a portal into somebody's brain.

385
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,680
Yes, there is. A brain or soul or whatever.

386
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,200
I was inside John Malkovich lookin' out.

387
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,600
- Really?
- Yep.

388
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,320
- I wanna try it then.
- Pardon?

389
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,880
I want to be John Malkovich tomorrow.

390
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,640
That'd be perfect,
'cause then I can meet your partner.

391
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,920
The thing is, Lestercorp's open during
the day, so we can't go during the day.

392
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,080
But if you want to, we can do it right now.

393
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,640
- Now? Right now?
- Tonight, on the way to Lester's.

394
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,360
I'll meet you on the side of the road
by the New Jersey Turnpike.

395
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,160
I'm scared.

396
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,000
You don't have to do this, you know.

397
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,320
No.

398
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
No, I wanna go.

399
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,320
- You sure?
- Yeah.

400
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,360
<i>It's wet.</i>

401
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,480
<i>Weird.</i>

402
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,720
<i>That's nice.</i>

403
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,720
<i>God, I feel sexy.</i>

404
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,000
Lotte, are you all right?

405
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,440
Craig, I gotta go back!

406
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,600
- No!
- Maybe tomorrow.

407
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,320
- No! I gotta go back now!
- We'll talk about it later.

408
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Being inside did something to me.

409
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,280
I knew who I was.

410
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,160
It's like everything made sense.
I knew who I was.

411
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,920
But you weren't you.
You were John Malkovich.

412
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,320
God, I was. I was, wasn't I?

413
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I was John Malkovich.

414
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,920
I was John fucking Malkovich!

415
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,480
- Take me back, Craig.
- We're late for Lester.

416
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,960
So tell me, Lotte,
can you understand a word I'm saying?

417
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,880
Oh, yes, Dr. Lester. Absolutely.

418
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,280
You were just explaining
the nutritional value...

419
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,080
...of ingesting minerals through a colloidal
form which I couldn't agree more with.

420
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,240
Be still, my heart.

421
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,400
Dr. Lester, would you point me
in the direction of the restroom?

422
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:43,040
With the greatest pleasure, my dear.
You go up the grand "escalier"...

423
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,520
...and once atop the stairs you'll want
to enter the fifth door on my left.

424
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,720
- Watch the step down. It's sunken.
- Okay. Thank you.

425
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,520
What do you think Lester's relationship
with John Malkovich is?

426
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,480
That portal's been boarded up forever.

427
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,280
I bet Lester's not even aware of it, him,
the portal. Why?

428
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,000
No reason. I was just thinking.

429
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,760
Do you think that it's kind of weird
that John Malkovich has a portal?

430
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Do you think it might have some sort
of significance, for example?

431
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,840
I don't know. Why do you think that?

432
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
I don't even care.

433
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,000
I think it's kind of sexy
that John Malkovich has a portal.

434
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,440
Sort of like he's a vagina.

435
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,560
It's sort of vaginal, like he has a...

436
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,880
...he has a penis and a vagina.

437
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,920
It's sort of like...

438
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,520
...Malkovich's feminine side.

439
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,040
I like that.

440
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,160
"Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building...

441
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,080
...nightly from 9:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m."

442
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,040
Sounds good. Oblique, but intriguing.
Phone it in.

443
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,600
- Want me to phone it in?
- No.

444
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,480
- Lotte!
- Hi.

445
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,480
- I heard your voice.
- What are you doing here?

446
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,760
Is this your partner? She's pretty.

447
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,320
I had to do the Malkovich ride again,
you know? Is this her?

448
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,240
- Hi. You're Craig's wife?
- Yeah. Hi.

449
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,960
Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.

450
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,840
- Have you done Malkovich yet?
- Hi. Yeah, I want to place an ad.

451
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,840
Okay. "Ever want to be someone else?"

452
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,120
No, that's the ad, but we can talk
about you in a minute.

453
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,240
"Ever want to be someone else?"

454
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,200
"Now you can. Visit J.M. Inc."

455
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,840
"Inc. Mertin."

456
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,400
"M-E-R-T-I-N. Flemmer."

457
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,000
You should really be at work.

458
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,600
I've been going over and over
my experience last night, Craig.

459
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,920
It was amazing.

460
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,360
I've decided...

461
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,840
...that I'm a transsexual.

462
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,080
- I know it's the craziest thing, Craig!
- Are you fuckin' nuts?

463
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,520
No. It's just that for the first time,
everything just felt right.

464
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,680
I've got to make sure.

465
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,520
But if the feeling is still there...

466
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,880
...I'm going to talk to Dr. Feldman
about sexual reassignment surgery.

467
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,680
This is absurd!
Besides, Feldman is an allergist.

468
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,400
If you're going to do something, do it right.

469
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,280
You get these half-assed ideas
and do a half-assed job.

470
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,360
Just drop it.

471
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,720
It's just that I really like Dr. Feldman.
All right?

472
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,440
So I thought
that I would ask him his opinion.

473
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,760
Is there something so terrible about that?

474
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,400
- Why do you always yell at me like this?
- Sweetie, I'm sorry.

475
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,800
It's just a phase. It's the thrill of seeing
through somebody else's eyes.

476
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,280
Okay? It'll pass.

477
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,480
Don't stand in the way
of my actualization as a man.

478
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,240
Let her go, Craig.

479
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,080
- Okay.
- I mean him.

480
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,880
Right now?

481
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,480
It's the middle of the day.
How will I get her past Lester?

482
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,160
- Yawn. Figure it out.
- Okay.

483
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,520
Let's go. Come on.

484
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,640
- Bye.
- Bye.

485
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,040
Davey, it's Max.

486
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,080
Listen, can you get me
John Malkovich's home phone?

487
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,880
"But what I had been through."

488
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,920
"I am hungry as the winter."

489
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,680
"I am sick, anxious, poor as a beggar."

490
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,440
"Fate has tossed me hither and thither."

491
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,240
"I have been everywhere. Everywhere."

492
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,480
- "So strong."
- "But wherever I have been..."

493
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,240
<i>- "...every minute, day and night..."
- I want that voice.</i>

494
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,200
- "...my soul has been full..."
- "My soul has been full..."

495
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,560
- "...of mysterious anticipation."
- "I feel the approach of happiness."

496
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,720
"Anya, I see it coming."

497
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,800
<i>- Yeah?
- Mr. John Malkovich?</i>

498
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,480
<i>- Yeah. Who's calling?
- Oh, my goodness!</i>

499
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,120
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

500
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,600
<i>I'm a great admirer of yours.</i>

501
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,480
How did you get this number?

502
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,120
<i>It's just that...</i>

503
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,440
<i>... I dream about you.</i>

504
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,360
<i>And well, even speaking to you now
has gotten me sort of excited, you know?</i>

505
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,800
<i>The way this woman's talking to him.</i>

506
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,960
Listen, I really don't find this amusing.
Don't call here anymore, okay?

507
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,480
<i>My nipples are at attention,
General Malkovich, sir.</i>

508
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,920
<i>What, her nipples?</i>

509
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,600
<i>So why don't we have dinner tonight?</i>

510
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,200
<i>Bernardo's? 8:00?</i>

511
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,720
<i>I really want to see you.
I just loved you in that jewel thief movie.</i>

512
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,880
<i>You're not gonna meet her there?
Come on!</i>

513
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,320
<i>Meet her. Meet here there.</i>

514
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,240
<i>- Meet her there!
- "...as the winter."</i>

515
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,040
<i>"I am sick, anxious, poor as a beggar."</i>

516
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,840
<i>- Meet her there!
- "Fate has tossed me hither and thither."</i>

517
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,400
<i>"I have been everywhere. Everywhere."</i>

518
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,760
<i>"But wherever I have been,
every minute, day and night..."</i>

519
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,600
<i>Meet her there. Meet her there.</i>

520
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,280
<i>Yes!</i>

521
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,400
- How was it?
- I have to go back at 8:00 exactly tonight.

522
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,960
- Why?
- Don't crowd me, Craig.

523
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,800
- Excuse me. Are you John Malkovich?
- Yes, I am.

524
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,240
Wow. You really are great in that movie
where you play that retard.

525
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,240
Thank you very much.

526
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,160
- I have a cousin who's a retard.
- Thank you.

527
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,520
So, as you might imagine,
it means a lot to me...

528
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,080
...to see retards...

529
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,160
...portrayed on the silver screen
so compassionately.

530
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,280
Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

531
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,160
Good night.

532
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,440
<i>- Maxine? It's Maxine.
- Hi.</i>

533
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,800
I'm so glad you decided to come.
I'm Maxine.

534
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,240
I'm John. How do you do?

535
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,840
Good.

536
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:29,960
I wasn't sure I was going to come,
but I felt oddly compelled.

537
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,520
<i>You're so beautiful.</i>

538
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,480
<i>The way you're looking at me,
I mean, at him, at us.</i>

539
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,680
<i>I've never been looked at like this
by a woman before.</i>

540
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,280
<i>I think I'm sweating.</i>

541
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,560
I must say, I was intrigued by your voice.

542
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,600
And the funny thing is, Mr. Malkovich...

543
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,600
...my voice is probably
the least intriguing thing about me.

544
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,080
So, I mean, how was it?
What was he doing?

545
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,960
He wasn't doing anything, really.
He was just hanging around his apartment.

546
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,320
I think he's probably
just a really Ionely guy.

547
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,520
See, men can feel unfulfilled too, Lotte.
I'm glad you're finally realizing that.

548
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,920
You shouldn't assume
that switching bodies...

549
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,680
...is gonna be the answer to your problems.

550
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,480
You're right, Craig. You're right.

551
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,080
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that maybe...

552
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,720
...we should invite Maxine
over for dinner one night...

553
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,440
...because you're partners and
I thought it might be a really nice gesture.

554
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,600
- I think she'd like that.
- Maxine?

555
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,240
The thing is, there's been some tension
between us at work...

556
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,400
...business stuff,
and I would hate to expose you to that.

557
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,000
It'll be okay.

558
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,480
I'll cook my lasagna,
we'll smoke a joint, and...

559
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,680
...tensions will just melt away.

560
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,360
Now, when you say that I can be
somebody else, what do you mean exactly?

561
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,760
Well, we mean exactly that.

562
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,520
We can put you inside someone else's body
for 15 minutes.

563
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,320
Can I be anybody that I wanna be?

564
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,280
- Actually...
- You can be John Malkovich.

565
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,400
That's perfect!
It's my second choice, but it's wonderful.

566
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,840
I'm a fat man. I am sad and fat...

567
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,640
$200?

568
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,320
Yes.

569
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,880
Okay. You gotta crawl in there.

570
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,720
Oh, my God.

571
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,560
No, that's what I'm saying.
See, I don't really need an extra bath mat.

572
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,400
So if I get the set, would it be possible...

573
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,680
...if I could just get maybe three...

574
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,440
...extra hand towels...

575
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,760
...if I get the set, instead of the bath mat?

576
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,480
<i>- Yes, sir. Sure, we can do that.
- Great. That sounds good.</i>

577
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,080
And for the color: Periwinkle?

578
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,920
<i>I'm sorry. We're out of stock in periwinkle.
Do you want to back order?</i>

579
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,800
No. I'll go with the Ioden.

580
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,800
<i>Would you like to order anything else?</i>

581
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:44,480
What is the difference between
the foot-pampering, looped cotton rug...

582
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,640
...and the bath mat?

583
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,480
You're my friends. Thank you.

584
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,840
Did you know that Eskimos have not one...

585
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,920
...but...

586
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,280
...forty-nine words for snow?

587
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,640
It's because they have so much of it.

588
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,120
So much snow.

589
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,920
After dinner, I'll show you my puppets.

590
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,760
After dinner, I'll introduce you
to my chimp Elijah.

591
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,040
He has an ulcer right now
due to suppressed childhood trauma...

592
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,720
...but we're working through it.

593
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,640
Psychotherapy.

594
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,000
- This the bedroom?
- Yeah.

595
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,920
<i>The thing is, the way that I see it...</i>

596
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,840
...I think the world is divided...

597
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,640
...into those who go after what they want
and then those who don't, right?

598
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,240
- Right.
- The passionate ones...

599
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,440
...the ones who go after what they want...

600
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,240
...well, they may not get what they want.

601
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,360
But at least they remain vital.

602
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

603
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:37,400
So when they lie on their death beds,
they have few regrets.

604
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,040
Right?

605
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,440
And the ones who don't go after
what they want...

606
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,640
...well, who gives a shit
about them anyway?

607
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,320
- Lotte!
- Craig!

608
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,080
I don't find you attractive.

609
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,000
And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you.

610
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,280
I am. But only when you're in Malkovich.

611
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,800
When I looked into his eyes last night,
I could feel you peering out.

612
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

613
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Behind the stubble and the too-prominent
brow and the male-pattern baldness...

614
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,160
...I sensed your feminine longing.

615
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,960
And it just slew me.

616
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,760
Oh, my God!

617
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,480
Only as John, sweetie. Sorry.

618
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,960
Thanks for a wonderful dinner.

619
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,440
No hard feelings, partner?

620
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,840
J.M. Inc.

621
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,960
<i>Hi. It's Lotte.</i>

622
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,960
<i>I'd like very much to see you again.</i>

623
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,120
<i>Can you call him and invite yourself over?</i>

624
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,160
When?

625
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,240
<i>Tonight after you close?</i>

626
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,720
Okay, 4:11.

627
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,600
4:11?

628
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,920
<i>- Thank you, Maxine.
- You're welcome.</i>

629
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,560
Thanks so much for having me over,
sugarplum.

630
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,360
I'm glad you called.

631
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,720
Shall we to the "boudoir"?

632
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,520
A couple of minutes. I'm early.

633
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,040
So do you enjoy being an actor?

634
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,760
Sure. It's very rewarding.

635
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

636
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,840
<i>My sweet Maxine.</i>

637
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,520
<i>- My darling.
- I love you, Lotte.</i>

638
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,480
Did you call me Lotte?

639
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,120
Do you mind?

640
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,440
No, not really.

641
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,120
<i>- Oh, God.
- My sweet, beautiful Lotte.</i>

642
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,960
<i>Maxine!</i>

643
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,440
Yes, Maxine. Yes.

644
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,720
<i>Maxine, this is so right.</i>

645
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,960
- You were him, weren't you?
- Yeah.

646
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,720
And he was with her!

647
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,080
We love her, Craig.

648
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,280
<i>- We?
- John and me.</i>

649
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,600
Don't forget about me!

650
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,960
You have the Maxine action figure
to play with!

651
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm sorry. That was nasty.

652
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,560
You are late, my little cowboy.

653
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,080
Are you torturing me on purpose?

654
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,080
- I've fallen in love.
- I don't think so.

655
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,960
You know why?
Because I've fallen in love!

656
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,560
This is what people
who've fallen in love look like.

657
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,160
You picked the unrequited variety.
It's very bad for the skin.

658
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,320
You're evil, Maxine.

659
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,680
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have two people look at you...

660
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,560
...with total lust and devotion...

661
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,360
...through the same pair of eyes?

662
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,600
No, I don't suppose you would.

663
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,160
It's quite a thrill, Craigy.

664
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,840
What are you doing?

665
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,440
- Oh, my God! Is that real? What is that?
- Yes!

666
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,200
I don't know how to use it very well,
so don't make any sudden moves!

667
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,680
I'm serious! I'm serious.

668
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,720
Suck my dick!

669
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,120
Shut up, okay? Just shut up.

670
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,160
- Craig!
- Tell her you need to see her.

671
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,400
<i>J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.</i>

672
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,800
I need to see you.

673
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,720
<i>Sweetie!</i>

674
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,280
<i>I had so much fun with you last night.</i>

675
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,960
<i>Shoot. But it's business hours.</i>

676
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,720
Tell her, "What the hell,
close early, live dangerously."

677
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,400
Say it.

678
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,080
What the hell, you know?

679
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,440
Live dangerously. Close early.

680
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,960
<i>Doll.</i>

681
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,920
<i>I love this new devil-may-care side of you.</i>

682
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,280
<i>All right. I'll track down lover-boy
and see both of you in one hour.</i>

683
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,160
Exactamundo.

684
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:11,320
- What's the matter with you? Stop it!
- Sit up, okay? Just sit up. Just sit up.

685
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,960
Help! He's locking me in a cage!

686
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,480
Shut the hell up!

687
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,680
Shut up!

688
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,200
<i>"Was ever woman in this humor wooed?"</i>

689
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,000
"Was ever woman in this humor won?"

690
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,160
Tommy, can I take 15?

691
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,760
Good night, everybody.
See you back here at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

692
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,160
Lotte, this is so good!

693
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,640
<i>My God! This is amazing.</i>

694
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,720
<i>I want to touch her breast.
Touch her breast.</i>

695
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,800
<i>Move right hand across left breast now.</i>

696
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,320
<i>Move right hand across left breast now!</i>

697
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,520
<i>Move right hand across left breast now!</i>

698
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,160
<i>- Holy shit, yes!
- Holy shit, yes!</i>

699
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,080
<i>- Holy shit, he said what I said!
- Shit, he said what I said!</i>

700
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,920
<i>- Lotte? Is that you?
- Yes, yes, sweetheart.</i>

701
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,440
Yes, sweetheart, yes.

702
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,280
What the fuck is going on?
That's not me! I didn't say that.

703
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,520
<i>- Lotte.
- Maxine.</i>

704
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,880
Something was making me talk.

705
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,840
Some goddamn thing
was making me move.

706
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,240
- I've gotta get out of here.
- Doll face!

707
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,800
It was just your passion for me taking hold.

708
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:00,560
No, doll face. I know what
my passion taking hold feels like.

709
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,960
Bye!

710
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,320
I did it!

711
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:10,360
I made him move his arm
across your girlfriend's glorious tit!

712
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,920
And I made him talk, sort of.

713
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,640
It's just a matter of practice
before Malkovich...

714
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,160
...is nothing more than another puppet
hanging next to my work table.

715
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,720
I'll tell you about it when I get home, okay?
All right?

716
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Craig! I wanna...

717
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,560
No, man, I'm sorry...

718
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,400
...I'm sorry to have called you like that,
but I was just really scared.

719
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,840
I was so freaked out.

720
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:52,120
I mean, it was like, somebody was
just moving all the way through me...

721
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,840
...moving my arms, moving my hands,
talking for me.

722
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,000
I mean, literally,
I feel like I'm going crazy, Charlie.

723
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm sure you're not going crazy.

724
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,920
You don't understand, man.
It was like nothing I've ever felt before.

725
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,760
- Were you stoned?
- Yes, I was...

726
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,400
Jesus.

727
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,720
Yes, I was stoned.

728
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,440
But that doesn't have
anything to do with it.

729
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,920
Charlie, someone was talking
through my mouth.

730
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,840
You were stoned.
Case closed. End of story.

731
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,600
- How hot is this babe?
- You know what?

732
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,320
Maybe it was this Lotte woman talking...

733
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,120
...because it could have been her
talking through me.

734
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,440
Because the weird thing is...

735
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,760
...this Maxine likes to call me Lotte.

736
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,640
Ouch. That is hot.

737
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,120
Maybe she's using you
to channel some dead, lesbian lover.

738
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,960
She's my kind of gal.
Tell me when you're done with her.

739
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,760
What are you talking about,
"done with her"? Tonight freaked me out.

740
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,360
You're nuts to let a girl go
that calls you Lotte.

741
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,080
I don't know anything about the girl.
She could be a fucking witch or something.

742
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,800
That's even better!

743
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:04,760
Hot, lesbian witches.
Think about it. It's fucking genius.

744
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,680
I gotta know the truth, Charlie.

745
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,640
The truth is for suckers, Johnny boy.

746
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,320
Thanks.

747
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,080
This way.

748
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,080
Excuse me. Exactly what type of service
does this company provide?

749
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,120
You get to be John Malkovich
for 15 minutes.

750
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,240
200 clams.

751
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,360
I see.

752
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,960
- No cutting, by the way.
- No cutting!

753
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,760
Come on! Break it up!
Break it up! Cut it out!

754
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,560
Everybody gets...
It's him. It's John Malkovich.

755
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,440
Sorry, Mr. Malkovich.
Hope we didn't hurt you too terribly.

756
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,280
Get inside!

757
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,200
- Darling!
- What the fuck is going on?

758
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,920
John Malkovich. Mr. Malkovich, sir.

759
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:29,960
- Mr. Malkovich, I think I can explain.
- Yeah, explain.

760
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,120
My name is Craig Schwartz...

761
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,680
...and we operate a little business here...

762
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,440
...that simulates for our clientele...

763
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,280
...the experience...

764
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,680
...of being you, actually.

765
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,560
- Simulates?
- Yeah, after a fashion.

766
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,280
- What exactly does that mean?
- Well, it's hard to describe.

767
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,480
I want to do it.

768
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,560
That'd pale compared
to the real experience.

769
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,440
- I want to do it!
- Right now Mr. Hiroshi's in the tube...

770
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,320
- Let him do it, Craig.
- Of course.

771
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,720
Right this way, Mr. Malkovich,
compliments of the house.

772
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,920
Jesus.

773
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,960
What happens when a man
goes through his own portal?

774
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,720
We'll see.

775
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,800
Malkovich.

776
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,040
Malkovich. Malkovich.

777
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,240
- How was it?
- It was amazing this time.

778
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,240
- That was no simulation!
- I know. I'm sorry.

779
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,200
It's an honor.

780
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,160
I have been to the dark side.
I've seen a world that no man should see!

781
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,360
Really? For most people,
it's a rather pleasant experience.

782
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,120
That portal is mine,
and it must be sealed forever...

783
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:29,000
...for the love of God.

784
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,680
But, Mr. Malkovich, sir,
with all due respect...

785
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,960
...I discovered that portal.

786
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,840
It's my livelihood. You understand?

787
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,080
It's my head, Schwartz! It's my head!

788
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,800
I will see you in court!

789
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,720
What makes you think
I won't be seeing what you're seeing...

790
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,080
...in court?

791
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,520
Hey, Malkovich, think fast!

792
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,400
Fuck!

793
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,760
Dinner.

794
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,760
You know, Craig,
once this was a relationship...

795
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,000
...built on love.

796
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,920
Well, you gave up that claim...

797
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,920
...after the first time you stuck your dick
in Maxine, Lotte.

798
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,120
You fell in love with her first, Craig.

799
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:17,360
But I didn't do anything about it,
out of respect for our marriage.

800
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,640
You didn't do anything about it, Craig...

801
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,400
...because she wouldn't let you near her
with a 10-foot pole!

802
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,360
That's true.

803
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,800
God, Lotte, what have I become?

804
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,680
My wife, in a cage with a monkey.

805
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:50,280
I need to go to the bathroom
and take a shower.

806
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,520
What am I, some kind of monster?

807
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,120
I don't want to be a monster, Lotte,
I don't want to.

808
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,080
Craig, you're not a monster. No.

809
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,320
I know you're not a monster, honey.

810
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,600
You're just...

811
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:15,200
...a very, very confused man.

812
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,360
I love you so much.

813
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,720
I love you.

814
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,440
Come on, Craig.

815
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,000
<i>- J.M. Inc.
- Maxine.</i>

816
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,000
Lotte.

817
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,520
I've been thinking about us, you know?

818
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,920
<i>We have to meet.</i>

819
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,800
Okay, I'll see you in Malkovich in one hour.

820
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,080
Craig!

821
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,960
I hate you.

822
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,960
Elijah!

823
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,600
You really are magnificent.

824
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,960
<i>- J.M. Inc.
- Maxine!</i>

825
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,720
Honey pie! I was just heading
out the door to meet you.

826
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,840
<i>Listen, Maxine.</i>

827
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,880
It hasn't been me in Malkovich last time.
It's been that son of a bitch Craig.

828
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,160
He had me locked in a cage with my chimp,
holding a gun to my head.

829
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,960
<i>- Oh, my God!
- He made me call you.</i>

830
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,480
<i>I'm sorry, Maxine.
It's been him the whole time.</i>

831
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,840
I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

832
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,960
I miss you so much, Maxine.

833
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,800
So, but...

834
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,680
<i>...that was Craig inside of Malkovich?
- Yes, it was him.</i>

835
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,000
It's because he's a puppeteer, I think.

836
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,040
Well, boy, I'm...

837
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,240
I'm surprised. That's pretty impressive.

838
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,120
<i>- What?
- So if Craig can control Malkovich...</i>

839
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,880
<i>- ... and I can control Craig...
- But, Maxine...</i>

840
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,920
...I thought it was me that you loved!

841
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,680
I do.

842
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:20,160
It's confusing, you know?
This is a very confusing situation.

843
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,840
<i>I know.</i>

844
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,440
Listen, I should really get going, okay?

845
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,000
'Cause I'm gonna be late
for Malkovich now.

846
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,840
<i>- What?
- We'll talk about this later.</i>

847
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:38,920
<i>- Maxine! Wait!
- Okay?</i>

848
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,520
What the fuck do you want?

849
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,640
I can explain about the portal, darling.

850
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,920
Listen, don't con me, Maxine.

851
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:24,200
I don't know who the hell you people are,
but this insanity is now over.

852
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,920
Shut up.

853
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,560
Craigy. Craig.

854
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,160
Schwartzy, are you in there?

855
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,720
How did you know it was me?

856
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,360
Lotte called me.
She escaped your evil clutches.

857
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,240
Really? Well, I'm really sorry
I did that, Maxine...

858
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:52,120
...but I'm really in love with you,
and I didn't know how else to be with you.

859
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,840
Apparently you can control
this Malkovich fellow now?

860
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,120
Yes, I'm getting better all the time.

861
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,760
I'll say you are.

862
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,360
Hey, let's do it on his dining room table.

863
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,680
Then we'll make him
eat an omelet off of it.

864
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,840
No!

865
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:10,720
Shut up, you overrated sack of shit!

866
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,200
Craigy.

867
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,120
Yes?

868
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,240
Hi, Dr. Lester.

869
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:45,880
It's Lotte Schwartz, Craig's wife.

870
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,440
Yes.

871
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,800
Oh, my God.
You'll catch your death out here.

872
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,720
Look at you. You're soaking wet.
Please come in, come in.

873
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,440
- Here you are, my dear.
- Thank you.

874
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,040
How's that?

875
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,240
Much better, thank you.

876
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,200
So, my dear...

877
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,440
...what is it that brings you to my doorway
on such an inhospitable evening?

878
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,280
Well, Dr. Lester...

879
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,120
See, I...

880
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,920
I have a very unhealthy obsession
with John Malkovich.

881
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,800
I see.

882
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,960
You mean, the performer.

883
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,120
Yes.

884
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,440
And what prompted you
to come to me with this issue?

885
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:38,040
Well, when I was here
with my husband for dinner...

886
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:42,960
...I came upon a room that seemed to be
some sort of John Malkovich museum.

887
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,640
So I thought, perhaps, maybe you would...

888
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,000
...have some appreciation
for my state of mind.

889
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,320
You look so lovely, my dear...

890
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,160
...standing before the fire
in my oversized man's robe.

891
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,560
Thank you, Dr. Lester.

892
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,480
Tell me...

893
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,600
...what is this strange power
that Malkovich exudes?

894
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:15,520
You've gotta help me understand.
All I think about is wanting to be him.

895
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,560
- Wanting to what?
- Wanting to be him.

896
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,160
Wanting to be John Malkovich.

897
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,240
I see.

898
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,840
Well, perhaps you can.

899
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,040
But, Dr. Lester...

900
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,920
I am not Dr. Lester.

901
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,200
I am Captain Mertin.

902
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,600
I don't understand.

903
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,040
It was 90 years ago
that I discovered a strange portal.

904
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:47,200
And I found that this portal led
to a vessel body...

905
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,720
...and that I could live forever
by leaping from vessel to vessel.

906
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,440
- So Dr. Lester is such a vessel?
- Yes, he is.

907
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,920
You still there, sweets?

908
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:09,040
I figured out how to hang on
as long as I want.

909
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,160
It's all a matter of making friends
with the Malkovich body.

910
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,400
Rather than thinking of it as an enemy
that has to be pounded into submission...

911
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,680
...I've begun imagining it
as a really expensive suit...

912
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,040
...that I enjoy wearing.

913
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,120
This illustrates...

914
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,520
...how I will move
into my next vessel, Malkovich...

915
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,600
...on his 44th birthday.

916
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,320
That's when he becomes ripe.

917
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,160
But I must enter by midnight on that day.

918
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:46,200
After that, I'd get diverted
into the next newly forming infant vessel.

919
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,840
I don't want that to happen.

920
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:51,600
- I'd be absorbed.
- Absorbed? What does that mean?

921
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,000
Well, trapped, held prisoner,
if you like, in the host's brain...

922
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,680
...unable to control anything...

923
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:02,920
...forever doomed to watch the world
through someone else's eyes.

924
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,120
Now I'd like you to meet some friends.

925
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,400
See, I got Ionely in Lester by myself...

926
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,080
...so I figured out a way this time
to take others along with me.

927
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,680
Come.

928
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,520
Everyone, this is Lotte.

929
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:25,360
- Hi, Lotte!
- She's a new friend of mine.

930
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:33,120
Do a puppet show for me, Craig, honey.

931
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,600
You mean, with Malkovich?

932
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,520
- I'd love to see your work.
- Really?

933
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,920
Okay.

934
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,680
This is something that I call:

935
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:59,040
"Craig's Dance of Despair
and Disillusionment."

936
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:30,360
That was incredible! You're brilliant!

937
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,520
You see, Maxine,
it isn't just playing with dolls.

938
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,760
My darling, it's so much more!

939
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,160
It's playing with people.

940
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,520
Stay in him forever.

941
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,600
How will we make a living
if our clientele can't access to our product?

942
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,360
Well, we'll have all the money
in Malkovich's bank account...

943
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,600
...plus he does get
acting work occasionally.

944
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,680
No, please!

945
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,880
Shut up! We're trying to think here.

946
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,120
It is sort of like puppeteering.

947
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,320
- I like that about it.
- Exactly!

948
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:20,720
And no one would ever even
have to know it's not him.

949
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,520
And I could use Malkovich's
existing notoriety...

950
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,280
...to launch my own puppeteering career.

951
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,320
Craigy, that's brilliant.

952
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,240
So lovely. I've always wondered
what it would be like to have a penis.

953
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,560
- Now I'll know.
- Really? I know it's very...

954
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:41,000
Lotte? We like you.

955
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,240
We can see you're a kind
and decent woman...

956
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,880
...and so...

957
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:50,600
...we've decided to offer you a place
in John Malkovich with us...

958
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,560
...if you like.

959
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,680
Dr. Lester...

960
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,200
...you've been so kind to me...

961
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,160
...and trusting.

962
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,240
And...

963
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,640
...there's something I think you should
know about the Malkovich vessel.

964
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,760
<i>John's here to see you.
Should I send him in?</i>

965
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:17,800
Of course send him right in. Don't ever
keep him waiting again, you understand?

966
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,840
Hey, John.

967
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,040
Great to see you.
Sorry about the cunt at reception.

968
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,880
- This is my fiance, Maxine.
- Great to see you, Maxine.

969
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:32,640
Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Please, have a seat.

970
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,880
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

971
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,760
No, thank you.

972
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
<i>- Teresa, get me chicken soup.
- Okay.</i>

973
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,480
Chicken soup?

974
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,080
Larry? I want to get right to the point.

975
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,400
From now on, I'm no longer an actor.
I'm a puppeteer.

976
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,360
Okay. Great.

977
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,960
And I would like to redirect my career...

978
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,840
...so that from now on
the name John Malkovich...

979
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,960
...will be synonymous with puppets.

980
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,840
Sure. No problemo.

981
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:23,000
Poof, you're a puppeteer.
Just let me make a couple calls.

982
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,160
Honey? Maxine?

983
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,600
Maxine?

984
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,320
I'm busy.

985
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,080
Maxine, honey, it's on!

986
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,320
<i>Yeah, there's the truth, and there are lies...</i>

987
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,640
<i>... and, art always tells the truth,
even when it's lying.</i>

988
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,080
<i>The enigmatic John Malkovich...</i>

989
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,720
<i>... one of the world's greatest entertainers
and the man who reinvented...</i>

990
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,320
<i>... how we view puppeteering.</i>

991
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,960
<i>Tonight we look at the man
above the strings...</i>

992
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,560
<i>... and the woman behind the man.</i>

993
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,080
<i>Raised in Evanston, Illinois, Malkovich
had a lifelong interest in theatre arts...</i>

994
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,840
<i>... and as a young man,
was one of the founding members...</i>

995
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,040
<i>... of Chicago's world-renowned
Steppenwolf Theatre Company.</i>

996
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,480
<i>From there, it was a simple transition
to Broadway accolades...</i>

997
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,040
<i>... and Hollywood stardom.</i>

998
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,760
<i>But nothing could prepare the public
for what was to come next.</i>

999
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,240
<i>And so it was,
that just eight short months ago...</i>

1000
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,440
<i>... John Malkovich dropped the bombshell
that sent shock waves...</i>

1001
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,480
<i>... through the entertainment community.</i>

1002
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,640
<i>Turning his back on his former profession,
Malkovich had to start from scratch...</i>

1003
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,680
<i>... and pay his dues all over again
as a fledgling puppeteer.</i>

1004
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,040
<i>Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm John Malkovich.</i>

1005
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,680
<i>I'm really John Malkovich.</i>

1006
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,720
<i>From these inauspicious beginnings...</i>

1007
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:12,920
<i>... John Malkovich's rise to stardom
was fast and furious.</i>

1008
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,960
<i>His breakout performance was
at this year's Emmy Awards...</i>

1009
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,080
It's really good! I look really amazing.

1010
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,440
I'd fuck me.

1011
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,760
<i>If there's anything that upsets me
about it...</i>

1012
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,400
<i>... it's feeling like if I move
into it too quickly...</i>

1013
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,880
<i>... l'll be, you know, deemed an imitator.</i>

1014
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,800
<i>But, I think that
once we all get the courage...</i>

1015
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,920
<i>... to follow through on our instincts,
like Malkovich has...</i>

1016
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,560
<i>... I think that a lot of us
will move into puppetry.</i>

1017
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,440
<i>Malkovich's rise to fame brought about
a renaissance in puppeteering.</i>

1018
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:43,200
<i>No, no, no. What are you doing?</i>

1019
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,680
<i>I'm making him weep, John.</i>

1020
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,600
<i>You're making him weep,
but you're not weeping.</i>

1021
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,360
<i>Don't ever... with your audience.</i>

1022
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,440
<i>Until the puppet becomes...</i>

1023
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:55,160
<i>... an extension of you, it's a novelty act.</i>

1024
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,960
<i>It's Topo Gigio.</i>

1025
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,520
<i>No?</i>

1026
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,120
<i>He's a technical genius.</i>

1027
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,200
<i>He breathes life into inanimate objects.</i>

1028
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,320
<i>It's a very godlike thing...</i>

1029
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,440
<i>... to be able to take something and,
you know, make it live.</i>

1030
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,720
<i>He was the talk of the town...</i>

1031
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,400
<i>... from the Beltway to Broadway...</i>

1032
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,880
<i>... aided in no small part by his new wife
and manager, Maxine Lund.</i>

1033
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,680
<i>In Maxine,
Malkovich had found his mentor...</i>

1034
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,640
<i>... his muse, his inspiration.</i>

1035
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:34,040
<i>In Malkovich,
Maxine had found the love of her life.</i>

1036
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,080
There, there, my dear. Relax.

1037
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,360
This travesty will all be over with
by morning.

1038
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,000
<i>And the crowds have been
absolutely sensational...</i>

1039
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,440
<i>... and I'djust like to thank God
for giving us this opportunity...</i>

1040
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,360
<i>... to share our creative vision.</i>

1041
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:52,000
<i>Nothing was impossible for John
and Maxine in the early days.</i>

1042
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,520
<i>Their union was a joyous one,
and together they worked tirelessly...</i>

1043
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,880
<i>... to further Malkovich's
puppeteering career.</i>

1044
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,160
<i>John Malkovich, the artist...</i>

1045
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,480
<i>... and Maxine, the entrepreneur...</i>

1046
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,600
<i>... they make this character...</i>

1047
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,080
<i>... this protean figure
that we call John Malkovich.</i>

1048
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,160
<i>But some say Maxine has changed
since becoming pregnant...</i>

1049
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,200
<i>... recoiling from the limelight...</i>

1050
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:19,000
<i>... and, rumor has it,
from her husband's affections.</i>

1051
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,720
I'm so sorry.

1052
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,880
<i>Malkovich shows us...</i>

1053
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,280
<i>... a reflection of ourselves, our frailties...</i>

1054
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,880
<i>... and our, you know, desperate humanity.</i>

1055
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:49,520
<i>That's what makes him one
of the most relevant artists of our time.</i>

1056
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,120
<i>And what does the future hold
for John Horatio Malkovich?</i>

1057
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:57,480
<i>Well, to quote the Bard,
"He's got the world on a string."</i>

1058
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:02,640
<i>As the poet said, "The puppeteer's voice
need not merely be the record of man."</i>

1059
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,920
<i>"It can be one of the pillars, the props...</i>

1060
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,440
<i>...to help him endure and prevail",
and I believe that.</i>

1061
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,240
It's over!

1062
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,040
Max?

1063
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,760
I've gotta head down to ABT now.

1064
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,600
I've got the "Swan Lake" benefit tonight.

1065
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,560
But when I come back,
we can maybe celebrate...

1066
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,040
...Malkovich's big four-four.

1067
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,920
Okay?

1068
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,680
Jesus! Why couldn't I have found
the portal to a younger body?

1069
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:36,960
What if I fall tonight and break my hip?

1070
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:28,160
Like that, little girl?

1071
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:31,000
Huh, lamb?

1072
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,640
I love you.

1073
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:09,080
Bravo!

1074
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,440
Maxine?

1075
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,120
Hello? Hello?

1076
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,360
<i>- We have Maxine.
- Oh, my God.</i>

1077
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,640
Please, please, don't hurt her.

1078
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,840
Listen, I'll give you
anything you want. Please.

1079
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,880
<i>You listen to me, asshole.
I don't want your fucking money.</i>

1080
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:52,000
<i>What I want is for you
to leave John Malkovich now!</i>

1081
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,560
<i>- Who is this, Lester?
- Does it matter?</i>

1082
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,080
<i>We're gonna kill Maxine
if you don't leave the body immediately!</i>

1083
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,280
But I can't do that.

1084
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:04,040
I mean, if I leave Malkovich,
then I'm Craig Schwartz again.

1085
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:06,960
No career, no money.
Maxine will have nothing to do...

1086
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,200
She barely has anything
to do with me now.

1087
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:14,120
<i>Jesus, we're going to kill your wife,
you fucking lunatic!</i>

1088
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:14,960
God.

1089
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:18,040
<i>Listen, Schwartz, Malkovich is our vessel.
We're old.</i>

1090
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:22,760
<i>We're going to die if we don't
get into him by midnight...</i>

1091
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,320
He called our bluff.

1092
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,000
Shit!

1093
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,200
Can't we just go inside the portal
and push Craig out?

1094
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,080
No, he's much too powerful.

1095
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:52,200
Schwartz would just jam us down
into Malkovich's subconscious.

1096
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,720
Lotte.

1097
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:23,080
If I can't have you, no one will.

1098
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:27,200
Lotte, no!

1099
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,680
No, Lotte!
God, no, we can't really kill her!

1100
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:35,040
She's carrying Malkovich's seed!
My next vessel!

1101
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:44,320
Hey! Help me!

1102
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:50,840
- Where the fuck am I?
- We're in Malkovich's subconscious.

1103
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,840
The last thing you'll ever see, Maxine.

1104
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,360
Fag-o-vitch!

1105
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:00,560
Johnny, baby, Johnny.

1106
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,280
Bad. I am bad. I am bad.

1107
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,480
Maxine, I am gonna kill you!

1108
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,560
<i>You're creepy.</i>

1109
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,280
<i>Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!</i>

1110
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,720
I loved you so much!

1111
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:23,120
Why did you have to hurt me like that?

1112
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,960
I'm sorry, Lotte.

1113
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:29,280
I guess I loved you, too, in my way.

1114
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:33,560
You are so full of shit, Maxine!

1115
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,880
I know.

1116
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,560
I know!

1117
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:44,480
It's your baby, okay?

1118
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,400
What?

1119
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:50,280
The baby, it's yours.

1120
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:53,640
It's ours. I got pregnant
when you were in Malkovich.

1121
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,400
- You can't fuck with me any more, Maxine!
- I'm not!

1122
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,760
I kept it because I knew
you were the father...

1123
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,840
...the other mother, whatever...

1124
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,680
...because it was yours.

1125
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:14,520
So, we're parents?

1126
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,880
Together?

1127
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,160
Yeah.

1128
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,040
- Aren't you John Malkovich?
- No.

1129
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,440
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

1130
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,760
I can't believe you're in this shithole, man.

1131
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,080
- This is John Malkovich.
- I'm not John Malkovich.

1132
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:56,560
- This is John Malkovich.
- I am not John Malkovich!

1133
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:11,840
Yes?

1134
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,880
<i>Lester, please don't do it.
Please don't kill Maxine.</i>

1135
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:18,000
<i>- So you'll leave?
- Yes, I am leaving.</i>

1136
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:21,960
All right. Do it now
while I'm on the phone so I can hear...

1137
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,400
...and your lovely bride walks.

1138
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,160
Okay. Okay.

1139
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,960
I'm going.

1140
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,480
Now, my friends. The time is now.

1141
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,760
I'm free.

1142
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:20,760
I'm back!

1143
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:37,760
Lotte.

1144
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,120
Hello. Hello, young lady.

1145
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:21,160
We're Malkovich.

1146
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,760
Maxine! I did it, Maxine!

1147
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,720
I left Malkovich for you, sweetie!

1148
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:28,920
It's no good being Malkovich without you.

1149
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,880
- It proves I love you!
- Fuck off!

1150
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:34,520
- Doesn't it?
- He's not with us.

1151
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,560
Maxine, I love you!

1152
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,560
I'm gonna go right back into Malkovich,
and kick Lester out!

1153
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,800
And then you'll love me again! Maxine!

1154
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:10,840
- Machine.
- Hey. Malcatraz.

1155
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,920
- How are you?
- I'm very well. And you?

1156
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:14,560
- Good, good.
- You look well.

1157
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,400
Thank you. How's Celeste?

1158
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,080
She's good.
She's sorry she couldn't make it today.

1159
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,240
- She had to go to the store.
- That's okay.

1160
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,960
Charlie, hi! I didn't even hear the door.

1161
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:29,000
- Lookin' great, Flo.
- I'm looking grateful?

1162
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,880
Charlie, we are not getting any younger.

1163
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,200
Well, don't rub it in.

1164
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:38,040
Listen, Charlie,
I know this is going to sound crazy...

1165
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,240
...but what would you think
if I told you that I'd found a way...

1166
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,560
...for us to live forever?

1167
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,600
All of us.

1168
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,240
- Johnny boy, what are you talking about?
- All of us.

1169
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:52,720
Celeste, Floris, you, me.
Gary Sinise, maybe.

1170
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,080
I don't really understand.

1171
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:07,720
Charlie, this is Emily.

1172
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,040
Isn't she lovely?

1173
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,200
Pass the Cheetos.

1174
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,600
- You need more puffs?
- No, I want more.

1175
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,680
- Okey-doke. They're covered in grease.
- Shut up.

1176
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,600
- Can I swim yet?
- Can you swim yet?

1177
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,800
- What time is it?
- Shall we do the cramp test?

1178
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,640
Check her.

1179
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:38,120
Let me see.
Are you gonna throw up? Let me see!

1180
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,040
Are you gonna throw up?
Are you gonna vomit?

1181
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,200
Okay, you can swim.

1182
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,320
<i>Maxine.</i>

1183
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,840
<i>Maxine.</i>

1184
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:55,000
<i>I love you, Maxine.</i>

1185
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:58,400
<i>Oh, look away.</i>
