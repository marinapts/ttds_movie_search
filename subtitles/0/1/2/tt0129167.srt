1
00:01:16,547 --> 00:01:18,174
Mayday! Mayday!

2
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:22,053
This is the Annabelle.
I'm Iost and I'm taking on water.

3
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:26,933
My Iast good reading is
44 degrees north, 68 degrees. . . .

4
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:34,398
Portland Station to AnnabeIIe.
What is your position?

5
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:38,319
I don't know exactIy. Off the coast
somewhere near RockweII! Wait.

6
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:40,821
The Iighthouse! I see it!

7
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:02,653
Over here, honey!

8
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,077
Hey, Mom! You won't beIieve
our good Iuck. Guess what I found?

9
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:14,040
Hogarth, we've been
through this before. No pets.

10
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:16,667
But he's not a pet, Mom.
He's a friend.

11
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,795
We've got to rent a room
if we're gonna make ends meet. . .

12
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,506
. . .and no one wants
shredded uphoIstery.

13
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:24,634
You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.

14
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,179
UntiI you feeI sorry for him
and set him free in the house!

15
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:30,306
Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?

16
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,184
I remember the raccoon.

17
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,686
PIease, Mom, at Ieast Iook at him.

18
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:40,274
AII right. Where is this guy?

19
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:42,860
I can't read this handwriting.

20
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:45,446
That one shouId have Iettuce,
tomato, extra mayo.

21
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:49,116
I wiII go get him, okay?

22
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,371
So he wants us to hoId the mayo
and the mustard.

23
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:56,123
How about just hoId
the fIavor aItogether?

24
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:03,256
Excuse me.

25
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:07,134
Excuse me. Sir?

26
00:04:10,638 --> 00:04:11,556
Excuse me--!

27
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:17,562
-What's that?
-PIease don't move.

28
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:20,481
My pet's under your tabIe.
Don't Iook!

29
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,484
If you make a scene,
my mom won't Iet me keep him.

30
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:25,903
-What kind of pet, kid?
-A squirreI.

31
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:27,238
He's friendIy.

32
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:31,701
I'm teIIing the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space. I saw it.

33
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:34,745
And it was headed toward Iand.

34
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:37,373
I caIIed the government
in Washington about it.

35
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:40,918
Maybe it was a Sputnik
or an invader from Mars.

36
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:42,378
That's what it is.

37
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,255
It's an invader from Mars!

38
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,050
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified fIying object.

39
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:51,762
Unidentified? Knowing you, EarI,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.

40
00:04:58,227 --> 00:04:59,687
I saw it too.

41
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:03,274
I rest my case.

42
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,280
I beIieve you.

43
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,282
What if it is Sputnik?

44
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:13,034
Or a fIying saucer. . .

45
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,285
. . .from Mars?

46
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,329
I bet we couId find it.

47
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:19,373
Sorry, kid.
I didn't reaIIy see anything.

48
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:21,709
If we don't stick up
for the kooks, who wiII?

49
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,711
Is my son bothering you, sir?

50
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,926
No! CaII me Dean.

51
00:05:31,552 --> 00:05:33,930
Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?

52
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:34,931
I wiII, Mom.

53
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,850
-Right after I finish taIking with--
-Dean.

54
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:42,939
-Found your pet.
-Where?

55
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:47,026
SquirreI's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.

56
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:48,152
Don't wig out.

57
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:54,408
Okay. He's heading north now.

58
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:55,576
I'm sorry, kid. I'd Iike to apoIogize
to everyone in advance for this.

59
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:07,755
Check, pIease.

60
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:10,424
It's a rat!

61
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:22,687
HeIIo, this is Hogarth Hughes
speaking. Who's caIIing?

62
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:20,810
I'm reaIIy sorry, but--

63
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:22,520
Thank you.

64
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,023
I need to work Iate tonight.
There's chicken in the icebox.

65
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,943
You can have that and carrots--

66
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,237
I'm way ahead of you, Mom.

67
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:32,780
I'll make it up to you.

68
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,116
-I love you.
-Me too.

69
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:35,950
And, Hogarth...

70
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:39,996
. . .no scary movies, no Iate snacks,
in bed by 8:00. Got it?

71
00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:42,290
Come on, Mom.
It's me, remember?

72
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,961
Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Melon.

73
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:51,090
If we can transplant 15 %
of their brain matter into ours...

74
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,218
... we may be able to read minds.

75
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:59,432
Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.

76
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,475
You've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?

77
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,604
Let's say my place.

78
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:08,774
I was thinking the same thing.
Mind reader.

79
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:12,945
Darn. I seem to have left
my keys in the lab.

80
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,414
You're gonna get it.

81
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:33,841
Who 's there?

82
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:50,483
Come on!

83
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:52,568
Stupid antenna.

84
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:31,148
Invaders from Mars!

85
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:40,880
Honey?

86
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,749
HeIp! HeIp! Stop! HeIp!

87
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:52,261
Don't you know better than
to wander off at night aIone?

88
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:54,347
What if something happened?

89
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:55,389
I'm sorry, Mom.

90
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:58,517
Don't you ever do that to me again.

91
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:02,688
I was so scared.
I thought I'd Iost you.

92
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:07,902
You won't beIieve this.
Something ate our TV antenna.

93
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:13,115
No! I'm serious!

94
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:16,202
It's not Sputnik,
Iike Mr. Stutz thought.

95
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:19,330
No, it's a robot!
No, reaIIy, it is!

96
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:23,501
And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high!
And it eats metaI!

97
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:26,629
Stop it! Just. . .

98
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,714
. . .stop.

99
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:29,799
I'm not--

100
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:32,927
I'm not in the mood.

101
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:38,140
Come on. Let's go home.

102
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,952
A peaceful, stay-at-home
kind of day in a town...

103
00:14:58,494 --> 00:14:59,996
... very much like your own.

104
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:03,124
But then, suddenly,
without warning...

105
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,252
...atomic holocaust!

106
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,337
But how does one survive
an atomic attack?

107
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:10,423
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?

108
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:13,551
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.

109
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:15,636
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.

110
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:19,807
It was a metaI meteor.
It ate his boat. My dad says--

111
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:20,850
It wasn't any of those.

112
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:24,061
What wouId you know about it,
Poindexter?

113
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:27,148
Don't make me come over there.

114
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:29,233
Hands over your head
Keep low to the ground

115
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:32,320
Time to duck and cover
The bombs are coming down

116
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:33,404
Duck and cover

117
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,618
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it onIy eats metaI.

118
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:40,703
Shut up, you IittIe spaz!

119
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:44,832
It's been sent by foreigners
to take over the country.

120
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,918
We shouId bomb it to smithereens
before it does.

121
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:50,046
'Cause all the kids who don 't
Will cease to be around

122
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:52,131
Thanks for the scrap.

123
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:55,259
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this. . .

124
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,387
. . .this Iarge bite out of it.

125
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:02,558
That's why I'm seIIing it.
It's got a Iarge bite out of it.

126
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:06,729
-What couId've done this?
-I toId you what.

127
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:10,900
Strange invaders.

128
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:15,154
Thanks for beIieving me.
I reaIIy did caII the government.

129
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:18,241
They're sending someone
to take care of the whoIe thing.

130
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:20,326
Jeez, EarI.
You reaIIy are crazy.

131
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:23,454
Who in the heII wouId
the government send?

132
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,626
Kent MansIey,
UnexpIained Phenomena.

133
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:30,711
-Marv Loach. I--
-What happened?

134
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:34,882
Not sure. Sometimes the Iine'II snap
if the weather is bad, sure.

135
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:40,096
But for a whoIe tower to get
twisted up Iike that. . . .

136
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:41,138
It's got me beat.

137
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:46,352
It's aImost Iike it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.

138
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:49,480
Enormous beast.

139
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,566
What do you think?
Escaped goriIIa?

140
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:52,650
What department is that again?

141
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,779
I'm not at Iiberty to reveaI
the particuIars of my agency. . .

142
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:58,864
. . .and aII that that impIies.

143
00:16:59,407 --> 00:17:00,908
You mean nationaI security?

144
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:03,035
Let's put it this way.

145
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:05,121
Once in a whiIe, things happen. . .

146
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:08,291
. . .that can't be rationaIized
in a conventionaI way.

147
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,334
PeopIe wanna know
the government has a response.

148
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:13,462
I am that response.

149
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:15,548
So were there any witnesses?

150
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,676
WeII, sir, if you'II just foIIow me.

151
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:21,804
We did find this.

152
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:25,975
United States Government, huh?

153
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:29,103
Guess that means something big's
happening here.

154
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:32,231
No, Marv. Big things happen
in big pIaces.

155
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:36,444
The sooner I fiII out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.

156
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:39,530
Enormous beast, yeah. . . .

157
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,702
Biggest thing here is
the homecoming queen.

158
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:45,786
Oh, my God!

159
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:53,044
Come on, I need a witness.

160
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,172
-It's around the corner.
-Don't puII so hard.

161
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:58,257
It's Iike a chomp
out of the side of the car.

162
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:01,427
It's Iike a bite out
of a sandwich, Iike a--

163
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,726
What are we Iooking at here,
Mr. MansIey?

164
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,854
Something big, Marv.

165
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,025
Something big.

166
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:24,367
HeIIo!

167
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:26,452
Come out!

168
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:31,666
Hey, big metaI guy,
I got food here for you!

169
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,794
MetaI!

170
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,837
Crunchy, deIicious metaI!

171
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,923
Come and get it!

172
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:21,108
So I guess you're
not gonna hurt me, huh?

173
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:29,450
The shutoff switch.

174
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:33,621
You saw me save you.

175
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,919
So where are you from?

176
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:44,090
You came from the sky, right?

177
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,175
From up there?

178
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:48,219
Don't you remember anything?

179
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:55,518
Maybe it's that bump on your head.

180
00:20:58,104 --> 00:20:59,689
Do you taIk?

181
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:04,902
You know, words? ''BIah, bIah, bIah,''
Iike that? Can you do that?

182
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:13,244
WeII, you get the idea anyway.

183
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:14,328
Let's see.

184
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:18,457
See this? This is caIIed a rock.

185
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:20,543
Rock.

186
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,671
Good.

187
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,226
That is a tree.

188
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:40,354
Rock. Tree.

189
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:41,397
Get it?

190
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:46,611
That's right!

191
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:49,739
My own giant robot.

192
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:52,867
I am now the Iuckiest kid in America!

193
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:53,910
This is unbeIievabIe.

194
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:59,165
This is the greatest discovery since,
I don't know, teIevision or something.

195
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:03,294
I gotta teII someone. I shouId caII--
No, they'II panic.

196
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:06,380
PeopIe wig out and shoot
at something big Iike you.

197
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:10,593
Wig out. It means crazy.
You know, Iike. . . .

198
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:16,807
No, no! Don't do that!

199
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,893
That's the stuff
that makes them shoot at you.

200
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:23,105
Two nights ago, at approximateIy
1 ,900 hours, sat com radar. . .

201
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:27,276
. . .detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere. . .

202
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:30,404
. . .Iosing contact with it 2 1 /2 miIes
off the coast of RockweII.

203
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:33,532
Some assumed it was a meteor
or a downed sateIIite.

204
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,661
But Washington received
a caII from someone. . .

205
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:39,789
. . .who reported an actuaI encounter
with the object.

206
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,959
This is no meteor, gentIemen.

207
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:46,045
This is something much more serious.

208
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:50,174
We can't caII Ripley's Believe It Or
Not because they wouIdn't beIieve it.

209
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:52,301
And. . . .

210
00:22:52,843 --> 00:22:55,429
It's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon. . .

211
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,473
. . .Mom's gonna wonder where I am.

212
00:22:58,015 --> 00:22:59,559
If she comes Iooking for me
and sees you. . .

213
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:02,687
. . .we got the screaming probIem again.

214
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:05,815
So for now, wouId you,
you know, just. . .

215
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,900
. . .just stay here, okay?

216
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:09,986
I'II come back tomorrow.

217
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:19,412
Goodbye.

218
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:24,667
No, no.

219
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:25,710
Me go.

220
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:27,753
You stay.

221
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:29,839
No foIIowing.

222
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:31,966
Good.

223
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,052
I toId you!

224
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:39,223
I'II come back tomorrow!

225
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,267
Now, stay!

226
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,609
Bad robot!

227
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:07,418
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.

228
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,503
My mom wiII wig out.

229
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:12,590
That's right.

230
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,760
So you have got to stay
in the forest. . .

231
00:24:16,219 --> 00:24:17,762
. . .and I'II bring you
some food tomorrow.

232
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:21,974
But I gotta go home now.

233
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:25,061
So goodbye.

234
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,616
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?

235
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,701
Look at this mess!

236
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:50,086
Put it back!

237
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:52,213
Put it back right now!

238
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:56,342
HeIp me! I need your heIp!

239
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,554
Good, good!

240
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:07,812
Put them together. Like this.

241
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:09,897
This one here, that one there.

242
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,068
Okay, over, over. Good, good.
Now the other one.

243
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:17,196
Okay. Good enough.
Let's go!

244
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:20,324
What the--?

245
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,538
That's fine! Leave it aIone!
The train is coming!

246
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,623
The train is coming!

247
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:29,709
Come on, Iet's go!

248
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:54,734
You're aIive!

249
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:10,374
-Anybody out there?
-We're in troubIe now.

250
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:11,417
Are you aII right?

251
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,588
I've changed my mind.
You can foIIow me home. Let's go.

252
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:17,673
Mayor's office.

253
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:20,843
What? A train accident?

254
00:26:21,344 --> 00:26:22,929
He hit a giant creature?

255
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:24,972
What creature couId
be big enough to--

256
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:27,058
I need your car.

257
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:13,980
You can fix yourseIf? Neato!

258
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:17,108
Mom's home. Just stay here, okay?
I'II be back. Bye!

259
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:20,194
Bye.

260
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:30,621
What happened here?

261
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,792
Go on. TeII him what you saw, Frank.

262
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,005
You're not gonna beIieve this.

263
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:44,218
But it was a giant metaI man.

264
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,517
Does anyone know where
I can get to a teIephone nearby?

265
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,731
WouId you say grace?

266
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:03,988
Oh, my God!

267
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:08,159
Oh, my God. . .

268
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:10,244
. . .we thank you.

269
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:13,372
For. . .

270
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:15,458
. . .the food that Mom. . .

271
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:18,586
. . .has put in front of us and--
Stop!

272
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:21,714
The deviI. . .

273
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:25,885
. . .from doing bad things and. . . .

274
00:28:26,427 --> 00:28:27,970
Get out of here!

275
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:30,097
Satan?

276
00:28:32,683 --> 00:28:34,268
Go, so. . .

277
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:37,396
. . .that we may Iive in peace. Amen.

278
00:28:37,897 --> 00:28:38,439
Amen.

279
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:43,653
That was reaIIy unusuaI, Hogarth.

280
00:28:44,153 --> 00:28:44,654
Forgot to wash my hands.

281
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:00,294
Stop, stop!

282
00:29:01,837 --> 00:29:03,422
AII right. Come on. Over here.

283
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:23,234
Come on, over here. Come on.

284
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,490
Hey there, scout. Kent MansIey.
I work for the government.

285
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:39,917
Hey, there. Kent MansIey. Work for
the government. Your parents home?

286
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:40,960
We're eating.

287
00:29:42,503 --> 00:29:44,088
Who's there, honey?

288
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:47,216
HeIIo there. Do you have
a teIephone I couId use?

289
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:49,302
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you.

290
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:51,387
Thank you very much.

291
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:53,472
Here.

292
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:55,558
Pretend you're a gangster.

293
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:58,686
-You caII me at home for this?
-You don 't understand.

294
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:02,857
-It ate my car.
-And you saw this happen?

295
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:07,028
No, I didn't actuaIIy see it.
It went off into the woods.

296
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,113
So you don 't have any evidence?

297
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:11,198
But I've got an eyewitness!

298
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:13,242
An eyewitness with a concussion.

299
00:30:14,827 --> 00:30:15,328
This thing is a menace.

300
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,540
It tore up the power station.
It caused a train wreck!

301
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:20,583
What did?

302
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,668
TeII me again, MansIey,
and this time. . .

303
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:24,754
...listen to yourself.

304
00:30:26,297 --> 00:30:27,882
A giant metaI monster.

305
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:33,095
PIease, sir. I've got
a feeIing about this one.

306
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:37,266
That's lovely, Kent. But let me
try to explain how this works.

307
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:40,394
If you toId me you'd found,
say, a giant footprint. . .

308
00:30:40,937 --> 00:30:43,564
. . .I'd send an expert
to make a pIaster cast of it.

309
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:47,693
Get me a photograph and
I couId get some troops over there!

310
00:30:48,236 --> 00:30:49,779
But you teII me
you've got a feeIing. . .?

311
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:53,950
AII right, fine. You want evidence?
I'II get you evidence.

312
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:57,036
And when I do, I'm gonna want
a memo distributed.

313
00:30:57,578 --> 00:30:58,079
That sounds sweII.

314
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:01,207
I'll want that memo carbon-copied
and redistributed--

315
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,975
Hi. Thanks for
the use of your phone.

316
00:31:20,518 --> 00:31:22,103
Thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs. . .?

317
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:25,273
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.

318
00:31:26,774 --> 00:31:28,401
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

319
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:30,444
That's Hogarth!

320
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:35,616
What an embarrassing name.
Might as weII caII him Zeppo.

321
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:39,787
What kind of a sick person
wouId name a kid Hogar--?

322
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:41,873
Hog Hug.

323
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:43,958
Hogarth Hughes!

324
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:51,257
Kent MansIey.
You work for the government.

325
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:53,342
I wasn't gonna say that.

326
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:55,428
I have something for you, Hogarth.

327
00:31:57,054 --> 00:31:58,556
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?

328
00:31:59,098 --> 00:31:59,599
At the power station.

329
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:02,768
-Hogarth was there the other night.
-ReaIIy?

330
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,854
See anything unusuaI, Hogarth?

331
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:07,982
Nothing. . .

332
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:11,152
. . .unusuaI, reaIIy.

333
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:17,408
Gotta use the bathroom.

334
00:32:25,124 --> 00:32:28,794
Strange he's tightIipped. The other
night he couIdn't stop taIking.

335
00:32:29,337 --> 00:32:31,923
I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot.

336
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:34,008
A hundred-foot robot?

337
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:36,093
That's nutty!

338
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:37,136
What eIse did he say?

339
00:32:37,678 --> 00:32:39,222
No, wait, stop!

340
00:32:40,765 --> 00:32:41,307
Excuse me.

341
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:49,649
What is going on in there?

342
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:52,860
Are you aII right?

343
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:54,946
I'm fine.

344
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:58,032
You know, this sort of thing
is why it's so important. . .

345
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:01,202
. . .to reaIIy chew your food.

346
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:10,503
A IittIe privacy?!

347
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:11,546
Sorry.

348
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,631
Sorry.

349
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:15,716
He's been acting strange IateIy.

350
00:33:16,217 --> 00:33:16,759
That hurt.

351
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:29,272
Thank you again, Annie.

352
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:35,528
Good night, Hogarth. I'm sure
we'II see each other again reaI soon.

353
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:44,996
If you're gonna stay here. . .

354
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:48,082
. . .you gotta keep better track
of yourseIf.

355
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:54,297
Anyway, I thought you'd Iike
a bedtime story or something.

356
00:33:54,797 --> 00:33:57,425
I've got some reaIIy cooI ones.

357
00:33:57,925 --> 00:34:00,553
Mad Magazine, very funny.

358
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:03,681
The Spirit, very cooI.

359
00:34:05,224 --> 00:34:05,766
Boy's Life?

360
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:06,809
Oh, here.

361
00:34:08,352 --> 00:34:09,937
This guy is Superman.

362
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:12,023
Sure, he's famous now. . .

363
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:14,108
. . .but he started off just Iike you.

364
00:34:15,693 --> 00:34:19,322
Crash-Ianded on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.

365
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:23,534
But he onIy uses his powers
for good, never for eviI.

366
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:25,620
Remember that.

367
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:33,878
That's Atomo, the metaI menace.

368
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,963
He's not the hero.
He's the viIIain.

369
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:38,049
He's not Iike you.

370
00:34:39,634 --> 00:34:40,176
You're a good guy.

371
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,261
Like Superman.

372
00:34:42,762 --> 00:34:44,347
Superman.

373
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:50,603
You're hungry, aren't you?

374
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:53,731
But I don't have any metaI here.

375
00:34:55,274 --> 00:34:55,816
Just foIIow me.

376
00:34:58,402 --> 00:34:59,987
Pick me up, okay?

377
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:13,584
Okay, now, march!

378
00:35:34,939 --> 00:35:36,482
Oh, yeah. That's RockweII.

379
00:35:36,941 --> 00:35:37,525
Nice pIace, huh?

380
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:38,568
RockweII?

381
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:41,696
Yes, I was born right down there.

382
00:35:42,196 --> 00:35:43,781
RockweII!

383
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:47,952
No, stop!
Look out for the cow!

384
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:50,079
Come on, no, not there!

385
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:52,164
PIease stop. No, stop!

386
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:57,295
We can't go there yet.

387
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:00,423
PeopIe just aren't ready for you.

388
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:13,978
That was cIose.

389
00:36:14,562 --> 00:36:17,106
We can't go running around
Iike that, okay?

390
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:19,191
Look!

391
00:36:22,862 --> 00:36:25,489
That wouId be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.

392
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:29,660
We gotta hide!

393
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:30,703
You know, hide?

394
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:33,873
It's when you--
You know, when you--

395
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:34,916
Just get behind something, quick!

396
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:41,088
Don't move.

397
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:11,327
Our troubIes are over.

398
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:17,667
This is it.

399
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,752
AII you can eat.

400
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:35,309
Turn it off!

401
00:37:41,065 --> 00:37:42,608
Come on, turn it off!

402
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,121
AII right, who's out there?

403
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,419
I know you. SquirreI boy.

404
00:38:02,962 --> 00:38:05,548
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.

405
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,677
Come on inside, kid.
Sorry about the crowbar.

406
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,805
You'd be surprised how many peopIe
wanna steaI scrap.

407
00:38:13,347 --> 00:38:16,976
But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.

408
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:18,019
I mean, what am I?

409
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:22,231
A junkman who seIIs art
or an artist who seIIs junk?

410
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:23,274
You teII me.

411
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:26,402
I Iike it, I think.

412
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:30,573
Listen, you're not gonna caII
my mom, are you?

413
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:32,658
She doesn't know I'm out.

414
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:36,829
Don't worry, kid. It's not my styIe
to report a guy to the authorities.

415
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:38,915
I'm gonna have coffee.

416
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:43,127
What do you want, some miIk,
or what? MiIk?

417
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:44,170
Coffee's fine.

418
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,342
I drink it. I'm hip.

419
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:50,384
I don't know.

420
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:53,471
This is espresso, you know?
It's Iike coffee-ziIIa.

421
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:56,599
I said, I'm hip.

422
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:02,855
She moved me up a grade.
Now I'm more not fitting in.

423
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:04,941
I was getting A's.
Mom says, ''You need stimuIation. ''

424
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:09,111
-I go, ''I'm stimuIated enough now. ''
-That's for sure.

425
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:11,197
''You need a chaIIenge. ''
So now I'm chaIIenged. . .

426
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:15,409
. . .to keep my Iunch money because
of the mooses who wanna pound me. . .

427
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:17,495
. . .since they think I'm smarter.

428
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,580
But I'm not,
I just do the homework.

429
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:24,794
If everyone did, they couId move up
and get pounded too. More coffee?

430
00:39:25,294 --> 00:39:27,964
Look, it's reaIIy none
of my business, kid. . .

431
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:31,092
. . .but who cares what
these creeps think, you know?

432
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:33,135
They don't decide who you are.
You do.

433
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:37,265
You are who you choose to be.

434
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:42,478
-Did you hear that?
-No, wait. Stop!

435
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:56,033
It's okay!

436
00:39:56,576 --> 00:39:57,076
My God!

437
00:39:57,618 --> 00:39:59,161
-He isn't gonna--
-Run, kid! Run!

438
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,418
It's okay. He isn't--

439
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,545
It's okay.
He isn't gonna hurt me.

440
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:09,630
Don't squash him!

441
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:11,757
Do not. . .

442
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:13,843
. . .squash him.

443
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,929
His name is Dean.

444
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,056
We Iike Dean.

445
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:24,186
So. . .

446
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:26,272
. . .where'd he come from?

447
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:28,357
He doesn't remember.

448
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:30,443
He's Iike a IittIe kid.

449
00:40:31,986 --> 00:40:32,528
LittIe. Yeah.

450
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:35,656
Wait a minute.
You can taIk to him?

451
00:40:37,283 --> 00:40:39,827
He can't say a Iot of words yet,
but he understands things pretty good.

452
00:40:41,412 --> 00:40:41,913
I see.

453
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:49,212
He needs food and sheIter.

454
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,851
You got plenty of room here.

455
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,853
-This pIace is perfect.
-Go away.

456
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:11,108
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.

457
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:12,151
I can't hide it here.

458
00:41:13,694 --> 00:41:14,237
-''Him,'' not ''it. ''
-Whatever.

459
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,450
You don't even know where ''he''
came from. Or what the heII ''he'' is!

460
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:21,536
He's my friend.

461
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,664
Yeah, what am I?
Am I your friend?

462
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,834
Bring a Franken-bot with out-of-state
pIates, make me change my tune.

463
00:41:29,377 --> 00:41:31,963
I don't Iike that jazz.
God, I'm tired.

464
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:34,048
So, he can stay?

465
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,219
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.

466
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:49,689
SIeep tight.

467
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:51,732
I'II see you tomorrow.

468
00:42:05,872 --> 00:42:07,415
-You're up?
-Just making the bed.

469
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:11,586
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

470
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:18,885
Morning, sport. SIeep weII?

471
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:24,140
Isn't it wonderfuI?
We finaIIy rented our room.

472
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:27,268
I'm not very hungry.

473
00:42:39,196 --> 00:42:43,868
-This is Hogarth Hughes.
-I said he couId stay the night, kid.

474
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:44,952
It's morning now.

475
00:42:45,494 --> 00:42:50,166
I'II try to come over. But there's
this weird guy here who's watching me.

476
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:51,209
What's that mean?

477
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:54,337
I got this big, giant--
Giant thing out here.

478
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,465
I can't taIk right now, okay? Bye.

479
00:42:57,965 --> 00:42:59,550
Who was that, sport?
Friend of yours?

480
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:01,636
Yeah. He's a new kid.

481
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:06,891
Stop! Stop that! Stop it!

482
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:11,062
Mind if I ask you
a few questions, buckaroo?

483
00:43:11,562 --> 00:43:14,106
Why wouId you teII your mom
about a giant robot?

484
00:43:14,649 --> 00:43:16,192
What was at the power station?

485
00:43:16,734 --> 00:43:18,277
TeII anyone eIse?
How big is this thing?

486
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:20,363
Been in the forest IateIy?

487
00:43:20,905 --> 00:43:22,448
Champ? SIugger? Cowboy?
Where you going?

488
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,534
I'm going out!

489
00:43:25,076 --> 00:43:27,662
Why not take Mr. MansIey with you?
Show him the sights.

490
00:43:28,246 --> 00:43:29,747
Oh, Mom, the sights?

491
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:32,875
I'd Iove that. Give us
a chance to get acquainted.

492
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:34,961
There are two kinds of metaI.

493
00:43:36,587 --> 00:43:38,130
Scrap and art.

494
00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:40,216
If you gotta eat one,
eat the scrap.

495
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:44,387
What you currentIy have
in your mouth is art!

496
00:43:49,058 --> 00:43:49,600
Art?

497
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:57,900
Forget it. Forget it!

498
00:43:58,442 --> 00:44:00,027
It's gone. It's--

499
00:44:02,613 --> 00:44:04,156
That's not bad.

500
00:44:07,827 --> 00:44:10,413
First, you take a chocoIate bar.
Any bar'II do.

501
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:11,455
Do you mind if I. . .?

502
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:13,541
Knock yourseIf out, skipper.

503
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,669
You crumbIe up the chocoIate
into IittIe pieces.

504
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:19,797
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?

505
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,925
Yes, I see.
What do you caII this again?

506
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:26,053
LandsIide. It's new. Very new.

507
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:28,139
LandsIide.

508
00:44:29,724 --> 00:44:30,266
Topnotch.

509
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:35,521
You know, Hogarth, we Iive
in a strange and wondrous time.

510
00:44:37,023 --> 00:44:37,607
The Atomic Age.

511
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:40,651
But there's a dark side to progress.

512
00:44:41,152 --> 00:44:42,737
Ever hear of Sputnik?

513
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,822
Yeah, it's the first
sateIIite in space.

514
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:48,993
Foreign sateIIite, Hogarth,
and aII that that impIies.

515
00:44:50,578 --> 00:44:52,121
Even now, it orbits overhead.

516
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:55,249
Watching us.

517
00:44:56,876 --> 00:44:58,377
We can't see it, but it's there.

518
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:00,463
Much Iike that giant thing
in the woods.

519
00:45:02,048 --> 00:45:04,634
We don't know what it is or
what it can do. I don't feeI safe.

520
00:45:05,134 --> 00:45:05,676
Do you?

521
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:07,762
What are you taIking about?

522
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:10,890
What am I taIking about?
What am I taIking about?!

523
00:45:11,432 --> 00:45:14,018
I'm taIking about
your goIdarned security!

524
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,061
WhiIe you're snoozing. . .

525
00:45:15,603 --> 00:45:18,189
. . .back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?

526
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:21,400
Because everyone wants what we have!
Everyone!

527
00:45:21,859 --> 00:45:24,445
You think this metaI man is fun.
But who buiIt it?

528
00:45:24,946 --> 00:45:27,573
The Russians? The Chinese?
Martians? I don't care!

529
00:45:28,074 --> 00:45:29,659
We didn't buiId it,
and that's reason enough. . .

530
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,787
. . .to assume the worst
and bIow it to kingdom come!

531
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:36,958
Now, you'II teII me about this thing.
You'II Iead me to it.

532
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,086
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!

533
00:45:41,712 --> 00:45:43,214
HoId that thought and stay there.

534
00:45:51,055 --> 00:45:52,598
LittIe Iower. LittIe bit Iower. . . .

535
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,726
I thought you were in troubIe.

536
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:56,769
That sucks. Let me. . . .

537
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:59,897
I ditched this weird guy
staying at our house.

538
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,066
It took me hours to shake him!

539
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:04,151
I kiII myseIf to get out here!

540
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,239
And you have him doing
arts and crafts.

541
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,366
You got a probIem with
arts and crafts, IittIe man?

542
00:46:11,868 --> 00:46:14,495
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a IittIe undignified.

543
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:18,666
WeII, smart guy,
what wouId you have him do?

544
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:24,922
Main systems on. Main engines.

545
00:46:26,507 --> 00:46:27,008
One, two and three.

546
00:46:27,592 --> 00:46:31,178
AII systems go.
Five, four, three. . .

547
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,264
. . .two, one!

548
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:34,307
BIast off!

549
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,904
We're Ianding. We're Ianding!

550
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:50,990
We're Ianding!

551
00:46:56,704 --> 00:46:59,332
Say, can you guys
cooI yourseIves a IittIe?

552
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:00,374
We're pressing our Iuck here.

553
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:03,502
Hey, baby, we are cooI!

554
00:47:04,003 --> 00:47:06,631
WeIcome to downtown CooIsviIIe.

555
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:08,716
PopuIation: us.

556
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:13,930
WeII, can you move CooIsviIIe
to some pIace Iess conspicuous?

557
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:14,972
How about the Iake?

558
00:47:17,558 --> 00:47:19,143
Come with us. It'II be fun.

559
00:48:10,736 --> 00:48:14,448
This can't Iast forever.
We gotta teII somebody about him.

560
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:16,534
You worry too much.

561
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:21,706
Watch this!

562
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:23,708
AII right, we're watching.

563
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:27,920
This one's for professionaIs onIy!

564
00:48:30,548 --> 00:48:31,048
Banzai!

565
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:40,474
Come on in!

566
00:48:40,975 --> 00:48:42,560
The water's great!

567
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:44,645
No, thanks.

568
00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:46,731
You weenie!

569
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:49,859
Come on in.

570
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,987
It's reaIIy, reaIIy refreshing.

571
00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:02,371
What? You too?

572
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:04,415
You. . .

573
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,500
. . .big baby!

574
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:11,714
Banzai!

575
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:55,508
You're right in
the middIe of the road!

576
00:49:57,051 --> 00:49:57,593
AII right.

577
00:50:01,305 --> 00:50:04,892
I think that's enough fun
for one day.

578
00:50:20,032 --> 00:50:23,744
Are you okay in there? I'm back
with the toiIet paper you needed.

579
00:50:24,203 --> 00:50:26,873
Thanks! I think
I'm feeIing better now.

580
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:27,874
Much.

581
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,001
Much better.

582
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:39,302
It's beautifuI, huh?

583
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:41,387
Hey, Iook!

584
00:50:43,973 --> 00:50:44,515
It's a deer.

585
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:48,686
Let's get cIoser.

586
00:51:22,553 --> 00:51:24,138
WeII, I guess he decided to--

587
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:34,565
It's the monster!

588
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,163
It's dead.

589
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:52,333
Dead?

590
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,462
Don't do that!

591
00:51:59,048 --> 00:51:59,549
Why?

592
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:02,677
It's dead. Understand?

593
00:52:04,262 --> 00:52:05,805
They shot it. . .

594
00:52:06,347 --> 00:52:06,847
. . .with that gun.

595
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:17,316
What's wrong?

596
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:22,530
-Gun.
-Yes. Guns kiII.

597
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:26,701
Guns kiII.

598
00:52:51,183 --> 00:52:55,855
I know you feeI bad about the deer.
But it's not your fauIt.

599
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:56,898
Things die.

600
00:52:57,481 --> 00:52:58,983
It's part of Iife.

601
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,068
It's bad to kiII.

602
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:03,196
But it's not bad to die.

603
00:53:04,739 --> 00:53:06,324
You die?

604
00:53:06,824 --> 00:53:07,366
WeII. . .

605
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:11,537
. . .yes, someday.

606
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:13,623
I die?

607
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:15,708
I don't know.

608
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:17,835
You're made of metaI. . .

609
00:53:18,294 --> 00:53:19,921
. . .but you have feeIings.

610
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,007
And you think about things.

611
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,093
And that means you have a souI.

612
00:53:26,594 --> 00:53:28,221
And souIs don't die.

613
00:53:29,764 --> 00:53:30,264
SouI?

614
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:35,478
Mom says it's something inside
of aII good things. . .

615
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,563
. . .and that it goes on
forever and ever.

616
00:53:52,703 --> 00:53:56,374
SouIs don't die.

617
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:10,972
You're Iate for dinner.

618
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,143
Your mom's working Iate tonight.

619
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:17,186
So it's just us guys.

620
00:54:18,729 --> 00:54:20,314
And we're gonna have a IittIe chat.
Sit down!

621
00:54:21,899 --> 00:54:24,485
How's that? A IittIe too bright?

622
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:25,528
Good.

623
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:30,741
Forgive me. I wanted you
to Iearn something.

624
00:54:31,284 --> 00:54:32,827
What can I Iearn from you?

625
00:54:33,327 --> 00:54:33,870
You can Iearn this:

626
00:54:34,412 --> 00:54:35,955
I can do anything I want,
when I want. . .

627
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,083
. . .if it's in
the peopIe's best interest.

628
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,168
The giant metaI man, where is it?

629
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,297
I don't know what
you're taIking about.

630
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:46,465
You don't? WeII.

631
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:49,552
Does this ring a beII?

632
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:53,681
How about this?

633
00:54:55,224 --> 00:54:55,766
You've been careIess.

634
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:57,852
It doesn't prove anything.

635
00:54:58,352 --> 00:54:59,937
It'II get the Army here
with one caII.

636
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,023
What's stopping you?

637
00:55:02,523 --> 00:55:03,065
Where's the giant?!

638
00:55:04,609 --> 00:55:06,193
You can't protect him. . .

639
00:55:06,694 --> 00:55:09,322
. . .any more than you can
protect your mother.

640
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:14,535
It's difficuIt to raise a boy aIone.
We can make it more difficuIt.

641
00:55:16,162 --> 00:55:17,663
In fact, we can make it
so difficuIt. . .

642
00:55:18,206 --> 00:55:20,791
. . .it wouId be irresponsibIe
to Ieave you in her care. . .

643
00:55:21,334 --> 00:55:22,877
. . .and aII that that impIies.

644
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:26,005
-You'II be taken away from her.
-You can't do that!

645
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:28,090
Oh, we can. And we wiII.

646
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,347
He's in the junkyard.

647
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:36,432
McCoppin's Scrap, off CuIver Road.

648
00:55:37,975 --> 00:55:41,646
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metaI-eater.

649
00:55:42,146 --> 00:55:45,816
I wouIdn't worry about this.
It isn't reaIIy happening.

650
00:55:46,317 --> 00:55:48,945
This is onIy a bad dream.

651
00:55:52,573 --> 00:55:54,158
Where's the giant?

652
00:55:55,743 --> 00:55:58,329
This is only a bad dream.

653
00:55:58,913 --> 00:55:59,372
Yes, sir.

654
00:56:00,915 --> 00:56:01,457
This thing is reaI, sir.

655
00:56:01,916 --> 00:56:06,671
I not onIy have incontrovertibIe
evidence, I know where it's hidden.

656
00:56:07,213 --> 00:56:10,841
I don't know who buiIt it, but it's
massive and we're running out of time.

657
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:14,011
No doubt we shouId act.
The question is. . .

658
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:16,055
. . .can you afford not to?

659
00:56:17,598 --> 00:56:19,183
ExceIIent, sir.
You won't regret it.

660
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:21,269
Thank you, sir.

661
00:56:32,196 --> 00:56:34,824
The Army arrives in the morning.
Don't get cute.

662
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,123
I gotta warn Dean.

663
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,635
I'II be watching you.

664
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:14,882
Morning, Kent.

665
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,394
For some reason, the Army is
in our front yard, Mr. MansIey.

666
00:58:27,895 --> 00:58:29,522
PIease, caII me Kent.

667
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,633
-AII right, where is it?
-What?

668
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,761
You know darn weII what.
The monster.

669
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:02,847
The giant thing. The metaI man.

670
00:59:06,517 --> 00:59:09,061
The metaI man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.

671
00:59:09,604 --> 00:59:12,273
I thought I was under attack
or something.

672
00:59:13,774 --> 00:59:14,358
He's in the back.

673
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,444
Come on. I'II show you.

674
00:59:22,116 --> 00:59:23,701
You guys got here just in time.

675
00:59:24,202 --> 00:59:26,829
This rich cat, some industriaIist. . .

676
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,915
. . .wants him for
the Iobby of his company.

677
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:31,000
He whipped out his checkbook.

678
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:35,171
I said, ''Hey, you got him
for the rest of your Iife.

679
00:59:35,713 --> 00:59:39,342
But, what, I gotta Iet go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.

680
00:59:39,884 --> 00:59:41,427
Give me some time
to cut the umbiIicaI. ''

681
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,555
Here he is.

682
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,855
Anyway, I haven't soId him yet.

683
00:59:53,397 --> 00:59:57,068
So if you reaIIy want him
and if, you know, you throw in. . .

684
00:59:57,568 --> 00:59:59,153
. . .a competitive bid. . . .

685
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:00,238
Sir, Iisten.

686
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:03,324
Step outside, MansIey.

687
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,452
You reaIize how much hardware
I brought out here?!

688
01:00:06,953 --> 01:00:10,623
You just bIew miIIions of
UncIe Sam's doIIars out of your butt!

689
01:00:11,123 --> 01:00:13,751
I gotta admit, I'm reIieved that. . .

690
01:00:14,252 --> 01:00:15,836
. . .this is what
Hogarth was taIking about.

691
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:20,007
I mean, I was beginning
to think it was reaI.

692
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:23,135
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I Iike it.

693
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:27,306
But do you need aII this stuff
on the surface?

694
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,434
No, actuaIIy.

695
01:00:32,019 --> 01:00:33,563
It seems kind of sIapped on.

696
01:00:34,105 --> 01:00:35,690
Not as thought-out
as this other piece.

697
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:37,733
You Iike that one?

698
01:00:41,362 --> 01:00:44,031
You'II be inspector of toiIets
when I'm finished with you!

699
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:49,161
Pack up. I'II expect you back in
Washington to cIear out your office.

700
01:00:49,704 --> 01:00:50,204
Yes, sir.

701
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,459
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

702
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,545
You mean, you know about that?

703
01:01:00,172 --> 01:01:00,673
Now I do.

704
01:01:14,729 --> 01:01:17,356
Bye, Kent, and aII that that impIies.

705
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,400
Okay, you can move now.

706
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:22,570
Nice job!

707
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,785
Thruster to base.

708
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:30,828
I'm going in.

709
01:01:31,412 --> 01:01:33,998
OnIy one creature couId create
so much destruction.

710
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:36,083
The hideous, peopIe-eating. . .

711
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:40,254
. . .kiIIing machine, Atomo!

712
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,468
No Atomo.

713
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:55,937
I Superman.

714
01:01:56,437 --> 01:01:58,022
Okay, Superman.

715
01:01:58,522 --> 01:01:59,065
Take this!

716
01:02:03,694 --> 01:02:04,278
Stupid gun.

717
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,877
What's wrong?

718
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:25,091
As I was saying, take this!

719
01:02:31,973 --> 01:02:32,390
What happened? What--?

720
01:02:32,974 --> 01:02:34,475
Stay down and foIIow me.

721
01:02:42,316 --> 01:02:42,859
Get back!

722
01:02:46,445 --> 01:02:48,072
I said, get back! I mean it!

723
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:51,200
No, stop. Why?

724
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:53,286
It was an accident.
He's our friend.

725
01:02:53,744 --> 01:02:56,414
He's a piece of hardware.
Why do you think the Army was here?

726
01:02:57,915 --> 01:03:00,543
He's a weapon!
A big gun that waIks!

727
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:05,756
I not gun.

728
01:03:06,257 --> 01:03:06,799
Yeah, what's that?

729
01:03:08,426 --> 01:03:10,970
You aImost did that to Hogarth!

730
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:18,269
Come back!

731
01:03:18,769 --> 01:03:20,354
-Stop!
-Giant!

732
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:21,397
Come back!

733
01:03:27,153 --> 01:03:27,653
It was defensive.

734
01:03:28,196 --> 01:03:30,740
He reacted to the gun.

735
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,037
You won't get there
fast enough on foot.

736
01:03:56,349 --> 01:03:57,892
See, I toId you it was a big hoax.

737
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,020
Give me the binocuIars.

738
01:04:01,562 --> 01:04:02,063
There it is. I see it!

739
01:04:03,648 --> 01:04:05,191
It's big. It's waIking away.

740
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,276
-Give me those.
-There! See it?

741
01:04:08,861 --> 01:04:09,362
The monster! HoIy cow!

742
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:12,490
Watch it!

743
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:13,491
HeIp!

744
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:15,576
Somebody heIp me!

745
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,703
I don't wanna faII!

746
01:04:19,247 --> 01:04:19,789
HeIp!

747
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:20,831
I'm sIipping!

748
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:23,918
I can't hoId on much Ionger!

749
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,387
-Dad!
-Daddy!

750
01:04:37,014 --> 01:04:39,600
-He saved those boys!
-It's friendIy!

751
01:04:55,783 --> 01:04:56,284
What--?

752
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:02,540
Stop! Look!

753
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,710
Behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!

754
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,712
It's stomping the town!
I was right!

755
01:05:08,254 --> 01:05:10,840
-Sweet Mother of God.
-Look, damn you!

756
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:21,309
I am not a gun.

757
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:46,334
Let's get out of here!

758
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:47,376
Run!

759
01:05:59,347 --> 01:06:00,890
Stop! There's a kid in his hands!

760
01:06:02,475 --> 01:06:02,975
Stop shooting!

761
01:06:04,602 --> 01:06:06,103
He onIy reacts defensiveIy.

762
01:06:06,687 --> 01:06:10,316
If you don't shoot, he's harmIess.
TeII the generaI!

763
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:12,401
This is your fauIt, beatnik.
If you--

764
01:06:12,944 --> 01:06:13,444
Shut up and Iisten!

765
01:06:13,945 --> 01:06:16,572
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid.

766
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:18,658
I'II take care of it.

767
01:06:25,373 --> 01:06:29,085
He says the monster's kiIIed a kid.
Sir, we must stop it at aII costs.

768
01:06:29,544 --> 01:06:31,170
Go to code red. Repeat, code red!

769
01:06:33,714 --> 01:06:35,299
Mr. President,
we have a situation, sir.

770
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:43,641
Watch it, Iady!

771
01:06:57,738 --> 01:06:58,239
Look out for the bus!

772
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:14,964
You can fIy?

773
01:07:17,508 --> 01:07:18,092
You can fIy!

774
01:07:27,935 --> 01:07:30,563
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
Iike Superman!

775
01:07:57,131 --> 01:07:59,800
I've Iost visuaI.
Repeat, Iost visuaI!

776
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:06,015
Man, that was cIose!

777
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,126
Good caII, MansIey.

778
01:08:34,669 --> 01:08:39,382
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.

779
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:07,535
-It's stiII aIive!
-Shoot at it!

780
01:09:32,018 --> 01:09:32,476
Retreat! Retreat!

781
01:09:35,146 --> 01:09:36,689
Let's get out of here!

782
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:52,371
He's unconscious, but okay.
Let's get him in the car.

783
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:55,499
Drive, baby, drive!
Step on it! FIoor it!

784
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,670
It's gaining on us.
Faster! Faster! Hurry!

785
01:10:09,555 --> 01:10:11,140
AII battIeships fire!

786
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:12,183
Now!

787
01:10:12,683 --> 01:10:14,268
Now, damn it, now!

788
01:10:22,068 --> 01:10:24,654
Nothing can stop it!
We've hit it with everything!

789
01:10:25,196 --> 01:10:26,739
Not everything, generaI. The bomb.

790
01:10:29,408 --> 01:10:31,953
The Nautilus isn't far offshore.

791
01:10:33,621 --> 01:10:34,080
You scare me.

792
01:10:34,622 --> 01:10:37,208
You want us to bomb ourseIves
in order to kiII it?

793
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:39,293
The giant foIIows whatever attacks it.

794
01:10:39,794 --> 01:10:42,421
We can Iure it away from the town,
then destroy it.

795
01:10:44,966 --> 01:10:47,593
TeII the Nautilus to target
the robot and await my command.

796
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,806
This is Nautilus.
What's the giant's position?

797
01:10:52,265 --> 01:10:54,934
67.71972 degrees west...

798
01:10:55,393 --> 01:10:58,062
...by 44.50177 degrees north.

799
01:10:58,521 --> 01:10:59,063
Locked and Ioaded.

800
01:10:59,564 --> 01:11:01,148
My baby, I'm so sorry.

801
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,234
-Stop the car.
-You're aII right.

802
01:11:03,776 --> 01:11:05,319
Go back! We've gotta heIp him!

803
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:07,405
Are you crazy?
You're Iucky to be aIive!

804
01:11:07,947 --> 01:11:09,490
You're going to a hospitaI.

805
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,832
Out of the car!
We're evacuating.

806
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:19,917
We gotta get this boy to a hospitaI.

807
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:20,960
What boy?

808
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:28,217
Hogarth, no!

809
01:11:39,186 --> 01:11:39,812
No! Stop!

810
01:11:52,783 --> 01:11:53,284
This is GeneraI Rogard.

811
01:11:53,868 --> 01:11:56,412
Ready the attack and
retreat to the faIIback position.

812
01:11:56,996 --> 01:11:59,540
No! Stop! My son is out there!

813
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:03,711
No, wait. It's me. . .

814
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:05,796
. . .Hogarth. Remember?

815
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:09,967
It's bad to kiII. Guns kiII.

816
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:13,054
And you don't have to be a gun.

817
01:12:13,596 --> 01:12:16,182
You are what you choose to be.

818
01:12:16,724 --> 01:12:18,309
You choose.

819
01:12:19,852 --> 01:12:20,394
Choose.

820
01:12:32,365 --> 01:12:32,907
It's okay. It's okay.

821
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,035
We gotta show them you're good.

822
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:42,291
Missile ready.

823
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,377
What are you saying, he's friendIy?

824
01:12:44,919 --> 01:12:46,462
Attacking him triggers
a defense mechanism.

825
01:12:47,004 --> 01:12:50,633
Don't Iisten! Destroy the monster
whiIe we stiII have the chance!

826
01:12:52,218 --> 01:12:53,761
You shoot and
the whoIe thing starts over.

827
01:12:54,262 --> 01:12:55,805
Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!

828
01:12:56,347 --> 01:12:56,847
Orders, sir?

829
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:58,933
Which is why you have got to stop.

830
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,018
It's getting cIoser!
Orders, sir?!

831
01:13:01,561 --> 01:13:02,103
Don't shoot!

832
01:13:03,646 --> 01:13:05,231
HoId your fire! The boy's aIive?

833
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:06,274
It's a trick! Launch it.

834
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:08,401
Are you mad, MansIey?

835
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,361
AII units, stand down!

836
01:13:10,945 --> 01:13:12,488
Rogard to Nautilus.
Come in, Nautilus.

837
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:14,574
NautiIus standing by.

838
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:15,616
Launch the missiIe!

839
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:26,085
It's targeted to
the giant's current position!

840
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,213
Where's the giant, MansIey?

841
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:35,469
We can duck and cover.
There's a sheIter right there.

842
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:38,556
There's no way to survive this,
you idiot!

843
01:13:39,098 --> 01:13:40,641
You mean, we're aII going to--

844
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:44,812
To die, MansIey, for our country.

845
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,982
Screw our country! I want to Iive!

846
01:13:54,739 --> 01:13:55,239
HoId him, men.

847
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:58,367
Make sure he stays here,
Iike a good soIdier.

848
01:14:13,507 --> 01:14:14,008
It's a missiIe.

849
01:14:14,508 --> 01:14:16,135
When it comes down. . .

850
01:14:17,678 --> 01:14:18,221
. . .everyone wiII die.

851
01:14:18,721 --> 01:14:19,263
There it is!

852
01:14:36,447 --> 01:14:39,033
-ShouIdn't we get to a sheIter?
-It wouIdn't matter.

853
01:14:40,618 --> 01:14:42,161
I fix.

854
01:14:57,301 --> 01:14:58,844
You stay.

855
01:15:01,472 --> 01:15:03,015
I go.

856
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:11,399
No foIIowing.

857
01:15:21,242 --> 01:15:22,827
I Iove you.

858
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:51,981
You are who you choose to be.

859
01:15:56,694 --> 01:15:58,279
Superman.

860
01:16:31,145 --> 01:16:31,604
Let's go home.

861
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:21,654
Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.

862
01:17:22,196 --> 01:17:24,824
You think this is my best? ReaIIy?

863
01:17:26,367 --> 01:17:28,995
You know, next to that bug thing.

864
01:17:29,495 --> 01:17:32,123
You know, the one with the shoveIs. . . .

865
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:35,209
Come on, honey. Time to go.

866
01:17:36,794 --> 01:17:37,295
See you Iater, guys.

867
01:17:37,837 --> 01:17:39,380
See you Iater, Hogarth.

868
01:17:40,965 --> 01:17:42,508
-The generaI sent this.
-What is it?

869
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:45,636
He said it was
the onIy part recovered.

870
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,763
He thought you shouId have it.

871
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:50,892
I miss him.

872
01:18:41,442 --> 01:18:41,943
See you Iater!
