eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

I'm calling
for Mr. Tamblin, please.

53
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,632
Well, we're all under
a deadline here. You see,
there's some basic information...

54
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:38,145
about your product launch
that isn't even covered
in your press release, and I'd--

55
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,079
Yeah, c--
can I ask you a question?

56
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,608
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.

57
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,519
Yeah. Okay.
I'll leave my number.

58
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:53,026
<i>It's 555-0199.</i>

59
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:56,621
Lester Burnham.
Thank you!

60
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:02,195
Hey, Les.
You got a minute?

61
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,967
For you, Brad,
I got five!

62
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,534
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.

63
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,738
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.

64
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,214
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.

65
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:19,151
<i>- Right?</i>
- Exactly.

66
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,156
<i>Like the time that Mr. Flournoy</i>
<i>used the company MasterCard</i>
<i>to pay for that hooker,</i>

67
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:27,388
and she used the card numbers
and stayed at the St. Regis for,
what was it, three months?

68
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:31,522
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000.
That's somebody's salary.

69
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,693
That's somebody who's going
to get fired because Craig
has to pay women to fuck him!

70
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,760
<i>Jesus!</i>

71
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,534
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.

72
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:43,076
- 
<i>- That's why we're having everyone...</i>

73
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:47,638
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.

74
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:51,481
That way management
can assess who's valuable--

75
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,282
And who's expendable.

76
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:57,051
<i>It's just business.</i>

77
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,389
I've been writing
for this magazine for 14 years.

78
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:04,693
- You've been here how long?
A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.

79
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,632
I'm trying to level with you.

80
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:11,194
This is your one chance
to save your job.

81
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,503
<i> There is no decision.</i>
<i>You just write the damn thing.</i>

82
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,602
-  You don't think
it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.

83
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,647
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.

84
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:23,445
Let's just all sell our souls
and work for Satan 'cause
it's more convenient that way.

85
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,543
Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh?

86
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,850
So, we finally
got new neighbors.

87
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:33,519
<i>You know, if the Lomans</i>
<i>had let me represent them</i>
<i>instead of the Real Estate King,</i>

88
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,119
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months.

89
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,961
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

90
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,627
<i>Their</i> sycamore?
Come on.

91
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,398
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

92
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,464
You know that.
How can you call it <i>their</i> sycamore?

93
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:52,638
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut
down something if it wasn't partially
mine, which, of course, it was.

to this elevator music?

98
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,661
No. No, we don't.

99
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,667
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,

you can listen

So, Janie, how was school?

102
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:27,078
It was okay.

103
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:29,582
Just okay?

104
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,746
No, Dad.
It was spectacular.

105
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:39,659
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?

106
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:42,127
They've hired
this efficiency expert,

107
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,926
this really friendly guy
named Brad--

108
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:49,436
How perfect is that?
And he's basically there
to make it seem they're justified...

109
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,961
in firing somebody,
because they couldn't just come
out and say that, could they?

110
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,373
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us--

111
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,936
 You couldn't
possibly care less, could you?

112
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,141
What do you expect ?

113
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:06,482
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.

114
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:12,319
I mean, hello, you've barely even
spoken to me for months.

115
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:21,425
Oh, what ?
You're " Mother of the Year" ?

116
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,960
- 
You treat her like an employee.
- What ?

117
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:29,672

What ?

118
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,405
I'm going
to get some ice cream.

119
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,056
Janie...

120
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:49,228

121

have to wait for me to come to you.

123
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,898
Oh, great.
So now it's my fault ?

124
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,376
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It--

125

<i>Wait till you see</i>
<i>the native stone fireplace!</i>

139
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:46,663
A simple cream could
really lighten things up.
You could even put in a skylight.

140
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,537
Well, why don't we
go into the kitchen ?

141

It's a dream come true

Just filled
with positive energy, huh ?

143
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,014
And you'll be surprised
how much a ceiling fan can
cut down on your energy costs.

144

Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.

448
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,777
Coming, Dad.

449
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,374
<i>You know I don't like</i>
<i>locked doors in my house, boy.</i>

450
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:35,551
- I'm sorry.
I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.

451
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:39,256

So what's up ?

452
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,130
I-- I need a urine sample.

453
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,136
Wow.

454
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,900
It's been six months already.

455
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:52,067
Can I give it to you in the morning ?
I just took a whiz.

456
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:54,270
Yeah. I suppose.

457
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,980
Y-You know--

458
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:12,327
Well, good night, son.

459
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:10,828
<i></i>

460
00:43:18,577 --> 00:43:20,636
I've been waiting for you.

461
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,993
You've been working out,
haven't you ?

462
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:46,230
I can tell.

463
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:50,833
I was hoping you could
give me a bath.

464
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:53,434
I'm very, very dirty.

465
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:28,642
What are you doing ?

466
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:32,006
Nothing.

467
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:34,678
- You were masturbating.
-  I was not.

468
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:37,586
Yes, you were.

469
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:41,422
Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.

470
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:45,088
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.

471
00:44:45,163 --> 00:44:48,098
You know, saying "hi"
to my monster.

472
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:50,100
That's disgusting.

473
00:44:50,168 --> 00:44:53,296
Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins.

474
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:55,635
- So do I.
- Really ?

475
00:44:55,707 --> 00:45:00,041
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.

476
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:03,707

Lester, I refuse to live like this!

477
00:45:03,782 --> 00:45:05,773
This is not a marriage.

478
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:08,945
This hasn't been
a marriage for years,

479
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,989
but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.

480
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:14,116
Well, guess what.
I've changed.

481
00:45:14,192 --> 00:45:16,786
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...

482
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:19,660
'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.

483
00:45:19,731 --> 00:45:22,427
I see. You think you're the
only one who's sexually frustrated.

484
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:25,629
I'm not ? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.

485
00:45:25,704 --> 00:45:27,865
Don't you mess
with me, mister.

486
00:45:27,939 --> 00:45:31,102
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.

487
00:45:31,176 --> 00:45:33,337
On what grounds ?

488
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:36,005
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

489
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:38,515
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

490
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,177
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...

491
00:45:41,253 --> 00:45:43,551
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!

492
00:45:45,557 --> 00:45:48,993
<i>But... I did support you</i>
<i>when you got your license.</i>

493
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,156
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

494
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:56,064
Oh!

495
00:45:56,134 --> 00:45:59,900
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay ?

496
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:14,284
<i> It's a great thing</i>
<i>when you realize you still have...</i>

497
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:16,946
<i>the ability</i>
<i>to surprise yourself.</i>

498
00:46:17,022 --> 00:46:21,015
<i>Makes you wonder what else you can do</i>
<i>that you've forgotten about.</i>

499
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:23,060
Hey, guys.

500
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:25,562
Lester. I didn't know you ran.

501
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,962
- I just started.
- Good for you.

502
00:46:28,033 --> 00:46:32,129
I figured you guys might be
able to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.

503
00:46:32,204 --> 00:46:35,037
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...

504
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:38,041
increased strength
and flexibility as well ?

505
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:41,567
I-- I want
to look good naked.

506
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:53,721


507
00:46:56,461 --> 00:47:01,160
<i>Oh, what is this ?</i>
<i>Fuckin' gay pride parade ?</i>

508
00:47:01,233 --> 00:47:03,326
Hey! Yo, Ricky.

509
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:06,666


510
00:47:06,738 --> 00:47:11,505
My entire life is passing
before my eyes, and those two
have barely broken a sweat.

511
00:47:11,576 --> 00:47:14,875
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

512
00:47:14,946 --> 00:47:16,937
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.

513
00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:20,109
Oh, whoa. Well.

514
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:22,449
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

515
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:29,360
Ricky, uh--

516
00:47:29,427 --> 00:47:33,022
I was thinking about the, uh--
I was gonna-- The movie we talked about.

517
00:47:33,098 --> 00:47:35,032
<i>- Re-Animator.</i>
- Yeah!

518
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,866
You want to borrow it ?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.

519
00:47:49,881 --> 00:47:52,475
- Can you hold this for a sec ?
- Sure.

520
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,646
I don't think my dad would try
to come in while someone else
is here, but you never know.

521
00:47:56,721 --> 00:47:59,781
- What is this ?
- Urine.

522
00:47:59,858 --> 00:48:04,227
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.

523
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:07,231
Are you kidding ?
You just smoked with me last night.

524
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:09,392
It's not mine.

525
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:13,233
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

526
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:16,900
Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.

527
00:48:18,977 --> 00:48:21,002
You like Pink Floyd ?

528
00:48:22,547 --> 00:48:24,981
I like a lot of music.

529
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:30,586
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

530
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:33,089
How much do you want ?

531
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:37,094
I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce ?

532
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:43,700
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.

533
00:48:44,936 --> 00:48:46,927
Wow!

534
00:48:47,005 --> 00:48:49,599
This shit is
top of the line.

535
00:48:49,674 --> 00:48:53,337
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. government.

536
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:57,177
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

537
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:01,184
Is that what we smoked
last night ?

538
00:49:01,252 --> 00:49:03,880
This is all I ever smoke.

539
00:49:07,726 --> 00:49:11,218
- How much ?
- Two grand.

540
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:13,560
Jesus!

541
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:16,498
Things have changed since 1973.

542
00:49:16,568 --> 00:49:20,299
- You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.

543
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:22,738
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

544
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:26,140
<i>Beep me anytime, day or night.</i>

545
00:49:26,211 --> 00:49:28,441
And I only accept cash.

546
00:49:28,513 --> 00:49:32,313
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

547
00:49:32,384 --> 00:49:37,321
God. When I was your age,
I flipped burgers all summer
just to buy an eight-track.

548
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:41,450
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.

549
00:49:43,094 --> 00:49:46,029
All I did was party
and get laid.

550
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:50,725
I had my whole life
ahead of me.

551
00:49:52,637 --> 00:49:56,971
My dad thinks I pay for all
this with catering jobs.

552
00:49:57,042 --> 00:50:00,011
Never underestimate
the power of denial.

553
00:50:03,114 --> 00:50:05,674
??

I'm going to whale on my pecks,

I see you're smoking pot now.
I-- I'm so glad.

563
00:50:50,962 --> 00:50:53,453
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances...

564
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:56,022
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

Uh-- Lester!

567
00:51:03,675 --> 00:51:05,700
You have such hostility in you.

568
00:51:05,777 --> 00:51:10,043
Do you mind ? I'm trying to work
out here. Unless... you want to spot me.

569
00:51:10,115 --> 00:51:13,710
Lester, you will not
get away with this.

570
00:51:13,785 --> 00:51:16,913
- You can be sure of that.

572
00:51:20,658 --> 00:51:22,785
you... think.

573
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:26,490
" My job consists of

Well, you obviously have no interest

580
00:51:46,317 --> 00:51:50,515
Brad, for 14 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

581
00:51:50,588 --> 00:51:54,319
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.

582
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:58,089
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.

583
00:51:58,163 --> 00:52:01,326
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,

584
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:03,924
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...

585
00:52:04,002 --> 00:52:05,936
buying pussy
with company money ?

586
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:08,734
<i>Which I think</i>
<i>would interest the I.R.S.,</i>

587
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:10,865
since it technically
constitutes fraud.

588
00:52:10,942 --> 00:52:13,877
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications...

589
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:18,211
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.

- One year's salary <i>with</i> benefits.

That's not going to happen.

592

What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot ?

Nope. I'm just
an ordinary guy...

599
00:52:56,387 --> 00:52:59,083
with nothing to lose.

600
00:53:04,062 --> 00:53:06,030
Yeah.

- Buddy.

Christy left for New York
this morning.

604
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:24,470
Let's just say things were
a little... hectic around the house.

605
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:28,041
- What's she doing in New York ?
- She's moving there.

606
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:30,144
Yes, we are splitting up.

607
00:53:30,221 --> 00:53:32,815
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

608
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:36,553
Yes. According to her, I'm...

609
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:38,653
too focused on my career.

610
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,722
- 
- As if being driven to succeed is...

611
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:45,530
some sort of a character flaw.


612
00:53:45,603 --> 00:53:49,596
Well, she certainly did
take advantage of the lifestyle
my success afforded her.

613
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:52,165
Ooh! Ha. Wow.


614
00:53:54,012 --> 00:53:57,175
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:53:57,248 --> 00:54:01,742
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

616
00:54:01,819 --> 00:54:04,515
Well, call me crazy,

617
00:54:04,589 --> 00:54:09,083
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

- Do you need a ride ?
<i>- Are you crazy?</i>

630
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:11,251
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces

631
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:14,780
It's okay. I'll walk.
But thanks.

- I fire a gun.
- Really ?

682
00:58:12,452 --> 00:58:15,319
Oh, yeah. I go to this
little firing range downtown,

683
00:58:15,388 --> 00:58:19,757
and I...just pop off
a few rounds.

684
00:58:19,826 --> 00:58:23,762
- I've never fired a gun before.
- Well, you've gotta try it.

685
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:26,765
Nothing makes you feel
more powerful.

686
00:58:28,835 --> 00:58:31,167
Well...

687
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:33,432
almost nothing.

688
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:41,303
- So, do you like your new house ?
- I like it.

689
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:44,908
The people who used to live
there fed these stray cats,
so they were always around,

690
00:58:44,984 --> 00:58:47,646
and it drove
my mother nuts.

691
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,679
And then she cut down
their tree.

692
00:58:51,758 --> 00:58:53,851
Is that a funeral ?

693
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:58,261
Yeah. Have you ever
known anybody who died ?

No.

696
00:59:03,503 --> 00:59:06,336
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once...

697
00:59:06,406 --> 00:59:08,840
just laying there
on the sidewalk.

698
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:11,172
She looked really sad.

699
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:27,284
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.

700
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,453
Why would you film that ?

701

- Because it was amazing.
- What's amazing about it ?

702

When you see something like that,
it's like God is looking right at you,

just for a second,

704

Your father and I were
just discussing his day at work.

Why don't you tell

him for almost $60,000.

this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of.

that I go through life

01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:20,492
This is not just a couch.

910
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:24,334
It's just... a... couch!

911
01:17:24,405 --> 01:17:26,600
This isn't life!

912
01:17:26,674 --> 01:17:28,869
This is just stuff,

913
01:17:28,943 --> 01:17:31,537
and it's become more important
to you than living.

914
01:17:31,612 --> 01:17:33,807
Well, honey,
that's just nuts.

915
01:17:42,857 --> 01:17:45,382
I'm only trying to help you!

916
01:17:50,498 --> 01:17:53,296

Don't.

917
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:55,460
<i></i>
<i>Why?</i>

918
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,730
It's weird watching myself.

919
01:18:00,808 --> 01:18:03,242
I don't like how I look.

920
01:18:05,813 --> 01:18:08,748
<i>I can't believe you don't know</i>
<i>how beautiful you are.</i>

921
01:18:08,816 --> 01:18:12,809
Look. I'm not going
to sit here for that shit.

922
01:18:21,228 --> 01:18:24,197
Ha! How does it feel now ?

923
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:26,233
Fine.

924
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,291
You don't feel naked ?

925
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,934
I <i>am</i> naked.

926
01:18:32,006 --> 01:18:34,440
You know what I mean.

927
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:46,611
So tell me about
being in the hospital.

928
01:18:49,623 --> 01:18:53,616
When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.

929
01:18:53,694 --> 01:18:58,893
He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.

930
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:02,458
I told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline, right ?

931
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:06,131
Of course,
I got kicked out.

932
01:19:06,206 --> 01:19:08,640
Dad and I had
this huge fight.

933
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:11,837
<i>He hit me.</i>

934
01:19:11,912 --> 01:19:15,871
<i>And the next day at school,</i>
<i>some kid made a crack about my haircut,</i>

935
01:19:17,685 --> 01:19:19,778
and I just snapped.

936
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:26,858
I wanted to kill him.

937
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:29,293
I would've... killed him...

938
01:19:31,298 --> 01:19:33,892
if they hadn't pulled me off.

939
01:19:37,004 --> 01:19:41,031
That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.

940
01:19:41,108 --> 01:19:44,942
They drugged me up and left me
in there for two years.

941
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:48,745
<i>Wow.</i>

942
01:19:48,816 --> 01:19:51,876
<i>- You must really hate him.</i>
<i>- </i>

943
01:19:51,952 --> 01:19:54,648

No.

944
01:19:54,722 --> 01:19:56,883
He's not a bad man.

945
01:19:56,957 --> 01:20:01,587
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my
dad if he did something like that to me.

946
01:20:01,662 --> 01:20:03,493
<i>Wait.</i>

947
01:20:03,564 --> 01:20:05,848
I already do hate my dad.

948
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:09,742
Why ?

949
01:20:11,753 --> 01:20:15,348
He's a total asshole:
he's got this crush on my friend Angela,

950
01:20:15,424 --> 01:20:17,654
and it's disgusting.

951
01:20:17,726 --> 01:20:21,287
- You'd rather he had the crush on you.
- 

952
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:23,627
- Gross. No.
<i>- </i>

953
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:31,529
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.

954
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:39,547
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.

955
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:42,880
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.

956
01:20:42,951 --> 01:20:45,146
How ?

957
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:48,747
<i>Well, now I, too,</i>
<i>need structure,</i>

958
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:51,987
a little fucking discipline.

959
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:05,233
I'm serious, though.

960
01:21:05,307 --> 01:21:08,242
How could he not
be damaging me ?

961
01:21:10,179 --> 01:21:13,114
I need a father
who's a role model,

962
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:15,776
not some horny geek boy
who's going to spray his shorts...

963
01:21:15,851 --> 01:21:20,584
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

964
01:21:20,656 --> 01:21:22,920
What a lame-o.

965
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,557
Someone really should just...
put him out of his misery.

966
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,696
Want me to kill him for you ?

967
01:21:43,378 --> 01:21:45,573
Yeah. Would you ?

968
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:49,284
It'll cost you.

969
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:52,047
I've been baby-sitting
since I was about ten.

970
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,645
I've got almost $3,000.

971
01:21:57,226 --> 01:21:59,990
Of course I was saving it up
for a boob job.

972
01:22:01,496 --> 01:22:03,657

977
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:32,820
Well, I guess I'm not
a very nice girl then, am I ?

978
01:22:55,317 --> 01:22:58,013
You know I'm not serious, right ?

979
01:22:59,087 --> 01:23:01,112
Of course.

980
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:19,639
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other ?

I've got a very important
appointment.

996
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:26,101
- Is it okay if Angela
sleeps over tonight ?
- She's always welcome.

997
01:24:26,174 --> 01:24:30,543
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.

I've been too embarrassed
to bring her over,

1001
01:24:42,724 --> 01:24:45,318
because of you and that way
that you behave.

1002
01:24:45,394 --> 01:24:48,761
- What are you talking about ?
I've barely even spoken to her.
<i>- Dad!</i>

1003
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:52,197
You stare at her all the time
like you're drunk!

1004
01:24:52,267 --> 01:24:54,531
<i>- It's disgusting!</i>
- You better watch yourself,

or you're going to turn into
a real bitch just like your mother!

Oh, I-I don't need a ride.

I don't get scared.

My parents will try

Mine won't.

1239

This is my first time.

You have nothing

- No, no, no. I'm fine.

You sure ?

1262

I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better. Thanks.

- What do you mean ?

1264
01:49:22,658 --> 01:49:25,149
I mean,

1265
01:49:25,227 --> 01:49:27,593
how's her life ?

1266
01:49:27,663 --> 01:49:29,824
Is she happy ?

Is she miserable ?

1268
01:49:33,135 --> 01:49:37,697
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

1269
01:49:40,008 --> 01:49:43,273

She's, uh--

1270
01:49:43,345 --> 01:49:46,405
She's really happy.

1271
01:49:46,482 --> 01:49:50,009
She thinks she's in love.


1272
01:50:00,763 --> 01:50:04,062
Good for her.

1273
