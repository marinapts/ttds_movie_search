1
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,853
Mrs. Peterson!

2
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,294
Ramon, hey! How's it goin'?

3
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,664
- How you doin'?
- There it is, there on the desk.

4
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,262
- Where's she headed?
- She's snowbound, Ramon.

5
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,111
- See you went with the pink.
- Yeah, yeah.

6
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,443
It's kind of a pink day today.

7
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,982
I'll have another pickup
for you on Thursday.

8
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,382
- All right. See you then.
- All right. Thanks.

9
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,920
# Bless my soul, what's wrong with me

10
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,355
# I'm itchin' like a man
on a fuzzy tree

Peterson! Peterson!

Peterson.

(Speaking Russian )

20
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,163
- Mr. Cowboy, da?
- Da.

21
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,465
Mmm, it's pretty.

22
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,131
(Speaking Russian )

23
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,176
It's from my wife.

28

(Man ) Time rules over us
without mercy,

29
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,310
not caring if we're healthy
or ill, hungry or drunk,

30
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,547
Russian, American, beings from Mars.

31
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,113
It's like a fire. It could
either destroy us or keep us warm.

32
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,853
That's why every FedEx office
has a clock.

33
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,919
Because we live or we die
by the clock.

34
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,862
We never turn our back on it.

35
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:38,393
And we never, ever allow ourselves
the sin of losing track of time!

36
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,462
Locally, it's 1:56.

37
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,839
That means we've got
three hours and four minutes

38
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,378
before the end-of-the-day's
package sort.

39
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,007
That's how long we have.
That's how much time we have...

40
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,917
before this pulsating, accursed,
relentless taskmaster

41
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,147
tries to put us out of business.

42
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,087
Hey, Nicolai.

43
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,216
Good to see you. How are you, kid?

44
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,626
You just delivered your very first
FedEx package.

45
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,096
That deserves something special,

46
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,601
like a Snickers bar and...
a CD player.

47
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,763
And something to listen to.
There. Elvis Presley.

48
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,000
Fifty million fans can't be wrong.

49
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,099
You all recognize this, don't you?

50
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,009
I took the liberty of sending
this to myself.

51
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,607
I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis.

52
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,517
You're probably wondering
what could be in here.

53
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,148
Is it architectural plans?
Maybe technical drawings?

54
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,387
Is this the new wallpaper
for the bathroom?

55
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,724
(Man translating into Russian )

56
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,423
It is...

57
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,262
a clock, which I started
at absolute zero,

58
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:46,294
and is now at 87 hours,
22 minutes and 17 seconds.

59
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:51,332
From Memphis, America
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours.

60
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,608
87 hours is a shameful outrage.

61
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,114
This is just an egg timer!

62
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,482
What if it had been something else?
Like your pay check?

63
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:04,011
Or fresh boysenberries?
Or adoption papers?

64
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,457
87 hours is an eternity.
The cosmos was created in less time!

65
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,758
Wars have been fought
and nations toppled in 87 hours!

66
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,855
Fortunes made and squandered.

67
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,991
(Translating)

68
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,201
What?

69
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,867
- What are you saying about me?
- I tell them, what do they expect?

70
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,776
This man, when his truck broke down,
he stole a boy's bicycle.

71
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,144
I borrowed it!
I borrowed a kid's bike.

72
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,981
I got my packages delivered,
and that is what you have to do.

73
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,647
You have to do whatever it takes,
because in three hours two minutes

74
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,748
every one of these packages
has to be on the big truck,

75
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,817
on its way to the airport.

76
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,192
- (Bell)
- 15 minutes!

77
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,733
- Crunch time! Crunch time!
- Crunch time!

78
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,997
Let's go! Every package
on the airport truck.

79
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,129
Go! Crunch, crunch, crunch!

80
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,173
- We have a big problem.
- What?

81
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,005
- The truck in Red Square is stuck.
- What?

82
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,511
- It's stuck.
- Stuck how? In snow? In ice?

83
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,380
The most important truck,
the Kremlin truck! Many packages.

84
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:18,561
All right. Let's put the table
right here. We'll just do the sort.

85
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,794
Ah, yeah, a clamp.
That would make us stuck.

86
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,496
Let's go. Unload...
Get him out of there.

87
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,198
Right here. Two lines, two lines.

88
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:31,403
One to the airport truck,
one to the Moscow truck. Got it?

89
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:35,573
CDG, FE, ME, Memphis on the airport
truck. Everything else there.

90
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,208
Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Four minutes.

91
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,541
(Rings )

92
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,078
'Hi, this is Kelly. If you're
calling for Chuck, press one.

pick up, pick up. You're not there.

'I'm doin' the sorts in Red Square,
in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.

96
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,366
'I miss you.'

97
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,528
I miss you, I really wanna kiss you.

98
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,971
I'm pickin' up the sweep
through Paris.

99
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,010
I should be back in Memphis
about 18 hours. That's the good news.

100
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,138
The bad news is...I gotta go
to the dentist this week.

101
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,206
I got something that's hurtin'.

102
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,412
I'll see you soon, and you know
what that means. Bye-bye.

103
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,955
Nicolai! Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock!

104
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,890
(Speaking French)

105
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,171
I absolutely, positively
have to get to Memphis tonight.

106
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,303
Can't help you. Try UPS.

107
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,779
Will we be able to push it
and make the sort?

108
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,873
- We'll do our best.
- "Our best"?

109
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:49,285
Gwen, what's wrong with our doctors
that Jack is certified to fly?

110
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,380
Aren't you concerned?

111
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,789
Terrified, but a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

112
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,420
That's the spirit.
Relentless is our goal.

113
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:02,160
What do you expect from the guy
who stole a crippled kid's bicycle?

114
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,533
I borrowed it. But I love
that the kid's now crippled.

115
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,869
So you missed the last truck
by two minutes?

116
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,636
Two minutes. Actually, it was less.

117
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,272
The plane wasn't heavy. You could've
added some fuel and picked up speed.

118
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:19,114
It's about the trucks.
Today's truck was two minutes late.

119
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,245
Tomorrow's will be four minutes late,
then six, eight.

120
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,721
Next thing you know,
we're the US Mail.

121
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,851
Well, all I'm sayin' is, if you'd
gotten all those trucks on the plane,

122
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,761
those Russkies would be
walking on water now.

123
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:36,165
Hey, don't give me that look.
It's just grape juice. Right, Chuck?

124
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:40,069
Yeah. It's like a 1992,
full-bodied grape juice.

125
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,266
See no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil.

126
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,708
We'd offer you some but
somebody's got to fly the plane.

127
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,242
Yeah, well, I "just say no," right?

128
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,316
Listen, Stan,

129
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,353
I've been meaning
to ask you, how's Mary?

130
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,685
Oh. Uh, well...

131
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,920
- We really don't know anything yet.
- Mm-hm.

132
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:05,828
Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday,
and, uh...

133
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,662
It hasn't meta... metastasized...

134
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,704
as far as they can tell right now.

135
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,707
It's just kind of wait and see.

136
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,675
I'm so sorry.

137
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,008
Tell her I'm gonna come by
and see her on my next layover.

138
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,743
I want you to know, Stan, we are all
thinking about her and you,

139
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,411
- and just blessings.
- Thank you, Gwen.

140
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,177
'Hi, this is Kelly.

141
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:33,690
'If you're calling for Chuck, press
one. Otherwise, leave a message.'

142
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,192
Stan...

143
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,700
Listen. Uh, I heard about this...

144
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,699
I heard about this doctor
down in Emory, in Atlanta.

145
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,870
He's supposed to be the best.
He worked on Frank Toretto's wife.

146
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,813
Frank's a systems analyst.
He played centerfield for us.

147
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,215
You know him. The softball tournament
last Labor Day.

148
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,151
Anyway, beside the point.

149
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,691
Uh, what I was thinking is,
is that I could get his number...

150
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,523
the doctor...and, uh,

151
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,927
You know, put you all together and...

152
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,000
You know,
you could get this thing fixed.

153
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,093
You could beat it.

- When it's chemically ordered...

157
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,295
- Is Kelly Frears around?
- She's copying her dissertation.

158
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,898
- You're home.
- Home indeed.

159
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,062
I love that you're home.

And Fred Smith had

Speaking of marriage,

189
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,099
when are you gonna make
an honest woman of Kelly?

190
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,798
How long?

191
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,740
- Fourteen minutes into the meal.
- You won.

192
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,209
- I owe you $5.
- Way before the pie.

193
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,647
I told him. Right about the time
the pie came out, the marriage...

194
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,742
Kelly's still recovering
after that parolee.

195
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,980
He was a lawyer.

196
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,354
I knew it had something to do with
swearing to tell the truth.

197
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,485
Remember when he fell and broke his
shoulder at the wedding reception?

198
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,326
He tripped on a kerb
holding a door open for me.

199
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,765
- Aunt Kelly was married?
- It's not worth remembering.

200
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,702
So since her failed marriage
to the parolee...

201
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,466
Oh, my God.

202
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,805
Kelly can't see being with
a man who wears a pager to bed.

203
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,039
What are you gonna attach it to?
When you wear it to bed,

204
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,707
I hope you got one of those things
that goes vibratin'.

205
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,115
I'm not touching that.

206
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,688
Oh, did you hit an olive pit?

207
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,817
- I thought I took all of them out.
- No, no, it's not that.

208
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,049
- O.K., I'll cancel Saturday.
- No, don't.

209
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,057
If I'm not here, I'm not.
But if I am, then I am.

210
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,617
It's cancelled.
But you gotta be here New Year's Eve.

211
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,426
Malaysia can't be that bad.
When do you defend your dissertation?

212
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,693
January 12.

213
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,498
(Sighs ) I'm gonna have to switch over
the South America thing.

214
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,799
If I do that on the third or fourth,

215
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,636
I'll have to head back out
on the 13th.

New Year's Eve.

217

I will be here New Year's Eve.
I promise.

218
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,712
What?

219
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,619
What about our Christmas?
I got a gift for you.

220
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,852
We have to do it in the car.

(Elvis Presley: "Blue Christmas")

222

Two more minutes. Thanks. Hey!

- Merry Christmas.
- I thought you were gonna stiff me.

What is the ribbon? A thousand-pound
test fishing line or something?

227
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,282
- Here's your fancy thing.
- Thanks.

228
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,528
I love the wrapping.

229
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,130
- And I love the box.
- Good.

230
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,034
Oh.

231
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,937
Oh, my.

232
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, that is terrific.

233
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,545
My grandaddy used it
on the Southern Pacific.

234
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,247
Hey, I took this.
This is my favorite picture of you.

235
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,979
You know what I'm gonna do?

236
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:48,288
I'm always gonna keep this
on Memphis time.

238
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,524
Hmm.

239
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,501
You haven't said anything
about your presents.

240
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,972
I'm sorry. No, I love 'em.
Look at my journal. Ah!

241
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,805
- What about the pager?
- Real leather. Gold on the pages!

242
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,711
- Did you like the pager or not?
- Yes. I love it.

243
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,772
Look at him in his little blue
Russian house.

244
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,647
- It's from Russia.
- My God.

245
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,312
- It's not one of those loud ones?
- No.

246
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:20,950
You can program it so it vibrates
and lights up and see it in the dark.

247
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,086
It seems like a real nice...pager.

248
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,189
- Sorry about the towels.
- I love 'em!

249
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,325
- You're hard to shop for.
- Every time I wash my hands,

250
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,960
- I will think of you.
- All right, I gotta go.

251
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,097
Merry Christmas.

252
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,905

- That reminds me. I almost forgot.

I have one more present for you.

258
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:10,767
Only this isn't an "open in the car"
kind of present

259
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,867
like, say, hand towels.

260
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,469
Which were a joke, by the way.

261
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,413
I'm terrified.

262
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:27,220
Just take it and hold onto it, and
you can open it on New Year's Eve.

(Rattling)

312
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,745
Hello!

313
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,755
Hello!

314
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,691
Anybody!

315
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,363
Anybody!

316
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,608
Help!

317
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,773
Help!

318
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,394
(Thud)

319
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,967
(Leaves rustling)

320
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,907
(Thud)

321
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,104
(Thud)

322
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,611
What is that?

323
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,142
Hey!

324
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,789
Hey!

325
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,629
Anybody?

326
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,455
(Thud)

327
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,935
(Grunting)

328
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,782
Hello?

329
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,883
Get! Go, go. Go! Go!

330
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,078
"Albert R Miller."

331
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,949
Not Alan. Albert.

332
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,034
So, that's it.

333
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,445
Hey! A ship! Hey! Hey!

334
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,376
Hey! Hey!

335
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,682
A ship! Over here!

336
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:15,189
Hey! Hey!

337
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:18,056
Over here! Over here!

338
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,494
Over here!

339
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:29,163
Over here! Over here!

340
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,673
Help me! Help!
Right here! Right here!

341
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,834
Help! Look here!
Look, look, look!

342
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:37,808
S...O...S!

343
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:38,903
Please!

344
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,883
Help! Come on!

345
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,613
Help!

346
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,047
(Screams )

347
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,288
(Screaming)

00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,356

349
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:40,125
(Wind howling)

350
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:18,239
(Grunts )

351
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,086
"Happy birthday."

352
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,262
"The most beautiful thing
in the world is the world itself.

353
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:57,466
"Johnny, have the happiest birthday
ever. Score! Your Grandpa."

354
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,150
Hmm.

355
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,203
(Crunch)

356
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,823
Come on.

357
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,161
Come on. Come on.

358
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:14,566
Come on. Come on.

359
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:47,989
(Screams )

360
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,225
(Yelling)

361
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,829
(Screams )

362
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,399
You wouldn't have a match...
by any chance, would you?

363
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:54,777
Oh, oh, oh!

364
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,163
The air got to it.

365
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,460
The air got to it!

366
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,239
Come on, come on. Come on.

367
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,084
(Gasping)

368
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,213
I did it. I did it.

369
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,588
Fire!

370
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,755
There you go!

371
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,890
Light it up! Come on!

372
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,525
# The time to hesitate
is through... #

373
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:21,591
Ouch!

374
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,762
(Laughing)

375
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:25,237
Ouch!

376
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:29,004
# No time to wallow in the mire

377
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:32,275
# Try now, we can only lose

378
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,248
# Cos, girl,
we couldn't get much higher

379
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:39,481
# Come on, baby light my fire... #

380
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:42,422
There you go! Here you go!

381
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,891
It's a signal fire!

382
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:49,325
And it spells out SOS!

383
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:51,093
Whoa!

384
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,731
It's a meteor shower!

385
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,737
Fireflies! Go! Run!

386
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,774
You're free! You're free!
Ouch! Ouch!

387
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,776
Yeah!

388
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:04,074
Yes!

389
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,546
Look what I have created!

390
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,776
I have made fire!

391
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,215
I...

392
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,378
have made fire!

393
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,133
Mmm!

394
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,233
You gotta love crab.

395
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,371
In the nick of time, too.

396
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:44,152
I couldn't take much more
of those coconuts.

397
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,687
Coconut milk's a natural laxative.

398
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,325
Things that Gilligan never told us.

399
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,292
Oh.

400
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,090
Mmm.

401
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:07,875
Pretty well-made fire, huh, Wilson?

402
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,604
(Thunderclap )

403
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:19,043
So...Wilson.

404
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:25,457
We were en route from Memphis
for eleven and a half hours.

405
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:29,520
About 475 miles an hour.

406
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,567
So they think that we are right here.

407
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,296
But...

408
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:38,430
we went out of radio contact

409
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,135
then flew around that storm...
for about an hour.

410
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:46,305
So that's a distance of what,
400 miles?

411
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:53,744
Four hundred miles squared.
That's 160,000...

412
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,588
times pi, 3.14.

413
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,253
(Muttering)

414
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,993
Five hundred and two thousand,
four...

415
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:08,969
That's a search area
of 500,000 square miles.

416
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,737
That's twice the size of Texas.

417
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,740
They may never find us.

418
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,505
(Thunderclaps )

419
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,115
(Groaning)

420
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,904
This tooth is just killing me.

421
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,568
It started out just hurting
when I bit down,

422
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:52,171
but now it just hurts all the time.

423
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:54,306
All the time.

424
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,648
It's a good thing there's
not much to eat around here,

425
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,449
cos I don't think I could chew it.

426
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,356
Just keep sucking on all that coconut
and all that crab.

427
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:13,462
And just think, I used to avoid
going to the dentist like the plague.

428
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:19,240
I put it off every single chance
I got. But now...

429
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,868
Oh, what I wouldn't give...

430
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:27,209
to have a dentist
right here in this cave.

431
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:29,341
(Groans )

432
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,455
In fact, I wish you were a dentist.

433
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,829
Yeah.

434
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,922
Dr Wilson.

435
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,442
You wanna hear something funny?

436
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:00,739
Back home in Memphis,

437
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:04,785
my dentist's name
is Dr James Spalding.

438
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,408
She's much prettier in real life.

439
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,800
(Groaning)

440
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,431
Ah... Ah.

441
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,331
(Whimpering)

442
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,741
(Yells)

443
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,778
(Thunderclaps )

444
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:37,191
(Clattering)

445
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,525
(Clattering continues )

446
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:47,659
Shut up!

447
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,564
(Clattering)

448
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,384
(Rumbling)

449
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,467
"Bakersfield"?

450
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,866
Bakersfield!

451
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,425
This could work.

452
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,901
This could work.

453
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:41,501
22... 44 lashings.

454
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,570
44 lashings. So...

455
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,941
We have to make rope again.

456
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:55,853
Wilson, we have to make
a hell of a lot of rope.

457
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:07,125
Eight lashings of these structurals.
That's 24 apiece.

458
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:11,205
That'll be 100... 160.

459
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,138
Here we are today.

460
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:18,646
That gives us a month and a half
until we're into March and April,

461
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:22,705
which is our best chances
for high tides and offshore breezes.

462
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:30,113
We need... We need 424 feet
of good rope,

463
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:32,716
another 50 feet for miscellaneous.

464
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:36,855
Round that off to 475 feet
of good rope.

465
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:40,292
Now, if we average 15 feet a day...

466
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:45,269
Plus, we have to build it,

467
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:49,640
we have to stock it,
we have to launch it.

468
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,310
That's gonna be tight.

469
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,474
That is not much time.

470
01:25:57,752 --> 01:25:59,686
But we...

471
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:02,279
We live and we die by time, don't we?

472
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:08,428
Now, let's not commit the sin
of turning our back on time.

473
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:12,423
(Laughs )

474
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,499
I know.

475
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,835
I know.

476
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,358
This is it.

477
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:45,196
That's all that's left.

478
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,997
I checked over the whole island,
and that is all that's left.

479
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,129
So we're gonna be short.

480
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,242
Short.

481
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:06,882
We're just gonna have to make
some more out of videotape.

482
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:09,456
Yes. No, we have time.

483
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:11,458
We do. We have time. Look!

484
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,722
The wind's still blowing in
from the west.

485
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:21,624
I know!

486
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:26,069
Yeah, I know. I know where there's
30 feet of extra rope!

487
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:29,473
But... But I'm not
going back up there.

488
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,675
There, there. There, you see? Huh?

489
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:47,448
There. Are you happy?

490
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:58,026
Do you have to keep bringing that up?
Can't you just forget it?

491
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:00,396
Huh? You were right.

492
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:04,667
You were right. It was good
that we did a test,

493
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:07,606
cos it wasn't gonna be
just a quick little snap.

494
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:10,803
I would have landed on the rocks.

495
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:13,540
Broken my leg or my back or my neck.

496
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:15,673
Bled to death.

497
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,344
It was the only option
I had though, O.K.?

498
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:20,478
It was what, a year ago?

499
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,580
So let's just forget it.

500
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:29,654
And what is your point?

501
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:33,194
Well...

502
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,758
we might just make it.

503
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,532
Did that thought
ever cross your brain?

504
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,474
Regardless, I would rather take
my chance out on the ocean

505
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:46,570
than to stay here and die
on this shithole island,

506
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:52,142
spending the rest of my life
talking to a goddam volleyball!

507
01:29:57,358 --> 01:29:59,189
Shut you up.

508
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,262
Wilson!

509
01:30:08,603 --> 01:30:09,661
Wilson!

510
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:18,477
Wilson!

511
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,808
Wilson!

512
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:23,841
Wilson!

513
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:27,553
Wilson.

514
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,356
Wilson!

515
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:37,592
(Sobbing) Oh, God! Wilson! Wilson!

516
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,266
Wilson!

517
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,774
Oh! Oh!

518
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:51,039
Never again.
Never again, never again.

519
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:54,444
You're O.K. You O.K.? Yeah.

520
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:15,499
Yeah, I know you.

521
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:17,901
I know you. I know you.

522
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:26,209
So... We O.K.?

523
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:28,948
O.K.?

524
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,980
O.K.

525
01:33:11,285 --> 01:33:13,344
You still awake?

526
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:17,723
Me too.

527
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:27,300
You scared?

528
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,404
Me too.

529
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:37,036
(Wind howling)

530
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,078
O.K.

531
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:53,278
Here we go, Wilson.

532
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:56,050
You don't have to worry
about anything.

533
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:58,148
I'll do all the paddling.

534
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:00,824
You just hang on.

535
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,404
Not yet! Hold on!

536
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:03,949
Not yet! Not yet!

537
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,391
Not yet!

538
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:12,991
Stand by, Wilson!

539
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:16,934
Hold on! Hold on, Wilson!

540
01:36:34,121 --> 01:36:37,420
(Laughing) I think we did it!

541
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:40,951
I think we did it!

542
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:43,028
Wilson!

543
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:46,896
I think we did it!

544
01:38:41,181 --> 01:38:43,877
(Whale song)

545
01:40:20,247 --> 01:40:22,306
Oh! They're gone!

546
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:30,557
I don't know why!

547
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,633
(Gushing)

548
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:55,699
Where's Wilson?

549
01:41:57,544 --> 01:41:59,409
Where's Wilson?

550
01:42:00,547 --> 01:42:02,606
Wilson, where are you?

551
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:05,845
Wilson!

552
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:11,554
Wilson!

553
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:13,892
Wilson!

554
01:42:41,788 --> 01:42:43,050
Wilson!

555
01:42:43,123 --> 01:42:45,182
I'm comin'!

556
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:49,161
Wilson!

557
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:10,774
Wilson!

558
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:13,546
Wilson...

559
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,491
Wilson!

560
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:29,964
Wilson! Wilson!

561
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:42,845
(Gasping)

562
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:44,417
Wilson!

563
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:49,855
Wilson!

564
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,221
I'm sorry!

565
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:55,953
I'm sorry, Wilson!

566
01:43:56,096 --> 01:43:58,621
Wilson, I'm sorry!

567
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:01,467
I'm sorry!

568
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:04,295
Wilson!

569
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:06,599
(Sobbing) I can't!

570
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:08,470
Wilson!

571
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:12,310
Wilson!

572
01:44:28,128 --> 01:44:30,460
(Sobbing)

573
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:52,441
I'm... I'm sorry.

574
01:44:55,522 --> 01:44:57,387
I'm sorry.

575
01:44:59,326 --> 01:45:02,159
I'm sorry.

576
01:45:28,722 --> 01:45:30,747
(Whale song)

577
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:02,044
(Alarm )

578
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,914
(Weakly) Kelly...

579
01:47:10,056 --> 01:47:11,648
Kelly.

580
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:15,758
Kelly...

581
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:20,329
(Rings )

582
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:23,068
Hello?

583
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:25,195
Oh, how are you?

584
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:28,571
O.K.

585
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:11,642
45 minutes.

586
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:14,845
One Dr Pepper...

587
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,787
two cups of ice.

588
01:48:17,858 --> 01:48:19,917
I like ice.

589
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:24,594
Well, here's the drill.

590
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:27,428
Um, plane pulls in, we get off,

591
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:30,959
and there's a little ceremony
right there in the hangar.

592
01:48:31,638 --> 01:48:34,106
Fred Smith will say a few words.

593
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:37,871
All you have to do
is smile and say thank you.

594
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:42,038
Then we'll take you over
to see Kelly.

595
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:46,651
She's actually gonna be there, huh?

596
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,280
Well, that's what we have arranged.

597
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:53,292
- If you're sure you wanna do that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yes.

598
01:48:57,564 --> 01:49:00,624
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to her.

599
01:49:01,101 --> 01:49:03,569
What in the world
am I gonna say to her?

600
01:49:06,606 --> 01:49:10,838
(Sighs ) Chuck...
Kelly had to let you go.

601
01:49:10,911 --> 01:49:13,004
You know?

602
01:49:13,079 --> 01:49:15,877
She thought you were dead.

603
01:49:15,982 --> 01:49:18,007
And we buried you.

604
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:23,846
We had a funeral and a coffin,
a gravestone.

605
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:25,983
The whole thing.

606
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,985
You had a coffin?

607
01:49:31,731 --> 01:49:33,722
What was in it?

608
01:49:34,968 --> 01:49:37,732
Well, everybody put something in.

609
01:49:37,804 --> 01:49:42,639
You know, just a cell phone
or a beeper, some pictures.

610
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:44,734
I put in some Elvis CDs.

611
01:49:47,614 --> 01:49:49,639
So you had my funeral

612
01:49:51,952 --> 01:49:54,716
and then you had Mary's funeral.

613
01:49:59,559 --> 01:50:03,051
Stan, I'm so sorry
I wasn't around when Mary died.

614
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:09,424
I should've been there for you,
and I wasn't.

615
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,806
I'm so sorry.

616
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:21,905
'Four years ago, the FedEx family
lost five of our sons.

617
01:50:22,515 --> 01:50:25,609
'That was a terrible and tragic day.

I'm sorry.
I must be in the wrong place.

631

No, you're in the right place.

632
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:20,635
You probably don't remember me.

633
01:51:20,707 --> 01:51:23,267
I did root canal on you
about five years ago.

Kelly wanted...

639
01:51:43,496 --> 01:51:45,521
Kelly wanted to be here...

640
01:51:48,134 --> 01:51:50,864
Look, this is very hard for everyone.

641
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:55,065
I can't even imagine
how hard it is for you.

642
01:51:59,512 --> 01:52:01,343
Kelly, uh...

643
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:05,976
She's had it rough.

644
01:52:06,052 --> 01:52:09,920
First when she thought she lost you,
now dealing with all of this.

645
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:11,854
It's confusing.

646
01:52:11,925 --> 01:52:14,155
It's very emotional for her.

647
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,194
She's...

648
01:52:17,831 --> 01:52:19,458
She's...

649
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:22,831
sort of lost.

650
01:52:23,269 --> 01:52:26,170
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

651
01:52:31,711 --> 01:52:33,975
Anyway...

652
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,139
I'm sorry that...

653
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:33,202
(Laughter and chatter)

654
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,365
O.K., people, let's go.

655
01:53:35,441 --> 01:53:37,466
Party's over. Let's go home.

656
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:40,206
(Man ) You're gonna
have to be down at the DMV.

657
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,976
O.K., Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

658
01:53:43,049 --> 01:53:47,042
I have to brief him on his meetings
with the accountants and attorneys.

659
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:49,850
I will see you bright and early
in the morning.

660
01:53:49,923 --> 01:53:54,053
- Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.

661
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:57,596
Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.

662
01:53:57,697 --> 01:53:59,631
Take care.

663
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:04,762
- Good night.
- Good night.

664
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:10,273
You got everything you need? O.K.

665
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:14,609
If you need anything, sign for it,
and I'll see you in the morning.

666
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:17,479
Get some sleep.
We got another big day tomorrow.

667
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:21,577
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

668
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:25,089
- Bring you back to life, man.
- (Becca ) Bye, Chuck.

669
01:54:25,158 --> 01:54:27,217
- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.

670
01:54:27,327 --> 01:54:30,421
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

671
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:16,935
How long are you gonna be, man?

672
01:56:19,038 --> 01:56:21,199
Well...

673
01:56:21,307 --> 01:56:24,868
- How long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

674
01:56:48,935 --> 01:56:50,926
I'm awake.

675
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:53,063
I saw your taxi drive up.

676
01:56:55,742 --> 01:56:57,972
Get in here out of the rain.

677
01:57:04,584 --> 01:57:06,984
I saw you down at the hub today,

678
01:57:07,053 --> 01:57:09,248
so I know you were down there.

679
01:57:27,573 --> 01:57:29,598
Let me get you a towel.

680
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:43,646
They're sleeping.

681
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,993
You'll come in,
I'll make you some coffee?

682
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:04,767
It's a nice house.

683
01:58:04,844 --> 01:58:07,312
Yeah, we got a nice mortgage too.

684
01:58:14,554 --> 01:58:17,284
What's your daughter's name?

685
01:58:17,356 --> 01:58:18,948
Katie.

686
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:21,924
Katie.

687
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:28,523
- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.

688
01:58:42,615 --> 01:58:44,674
Let me get one thing straight.

689
01:58:54,393 --> 01:58:57,920
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

690
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:01,997
(Exhales )

691
01:59:03,269 --> 01:59:06,466
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. O.K.

692
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:08,598
They used to be in Houston.

693
01:59:08,674 --> 01:59:12,633
First they were the Oilers,
and now they're the Titans.

694
01:59:12,745 --> 01:59:15,543
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

695
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:17,513
Yeah.

696
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:19,517
But that's not all.

697
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:22,611
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

698
01:59:22,688 --> 01:59:25,156
- And I missed that.
- You would've died.

699
01:59:25,258 --> 01:59:29,194
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard, right at the end.

700
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:34,495
I got whole milk,
two per cent and non-fat.

701
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:38,128
I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.

702
01:59:38,204 --> 01:59:40,263
That'll do fine.

703
01:59:52,818 --> 01:59:55,480
What happened
to you becoming a professor?

704
01:59:57,456 --> 02:00:01,290
You're not Dr Kelly Frears-Lovett?

705
02:00:04,397 --> 02:00:06,797
When you, um...

706
02:00:06,866 --> 02:00:09,528
When your plane went down,

707
02:00:09,602 --> 02:00:12,662
everything just
sort of got put on hold.

708
02:00:14,807 --> 02:00:17,469
I think about
taking it up again, though.

709
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:32,149
I came out here to give you this.

710
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:35,184
Oh, my God.

711
02:00:37,196 --> 02:00:39,221
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

712
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,496
And I, uh, I kept the picture.

713
02:00:44,904 --> 02:00:46,963
It was all faded anyway.

714
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:50,903
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

715
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:54,969
That's a family heirloom
and it should stay in your family.

716
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:08,058
That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.

717
02:01:08,127 --> 02:01:11,824
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

718
02:01:11,897 --> 02:01:15,594
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

719
02:01:19,739 --> 02:01:22,207
So here's where that ship found you.

720
02:01:23,476 --> 02:01:26,604
You drifted about 500 miles.

721
02:01:26,679 --> 02:01:28,874
This is where your island was,

722
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:32,440
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

723
02:01:33,853 --> 02:01:36,117
And these are the search grids.

724
02:01:36,222 --> 02:01:39,714
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

725
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:50,967
I never should've gotten
on that plane.

726
02:01:52,672 --> 02:01:55,368
I never should've gotten out
of the car.

727
02:01:58,978 --> 02:02:01,003
I wanna show you something.

728
02:02:02,915 --> 02:02:04,940
Come here.

729
02:02:14,593 --> 02:02:16,618
This is... This is our car.

730
02:02:18,864 --> 02:02:20,889
You kept our car.

731
02:02:23,035 --> 02:02:26,232
All right, now... This is weird.

732
02:02:34,714 --> 02:02:36,841
It's a good car.

733
02:02:36,916 --> 02:02:39,180
Had a lot of memories in this car.

734
02:02:39,251 --> 02:02:41,981
Two very nice memories.

735
02:02:42,054 --> 02:02:44,682
Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah.

736
02:02:46,492 --> 02:02:48,517
So, can I drive it?

737
02:02:48,594 --> 02:02:50,653
It's your car.

738
02:02:58,404 --> 02:03:01,498
That's good, cos my...
my taxi's gone.

739
02:03:07,546 --> 02:03:08,911
Um...

740
02:03:10,049 --> 02:03:12,517
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

741
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,965
You think you're gonna
have more kids?

742
02:03:37,042 --> 02:03:38,942
I don't know.

743
02:03:39,044 --> 02:03:41,740
It's kind of confusing right now.

744
02:03:41,814 --> 02:03:44,476
Well, you should.

745
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:46,609
I mean, really, you should.

746
02:03:49,054 --> 02:03:50,954
I would.

747
02:03:53,159 --> 02:03:55,184
So, what now?

748
02:03:58,164 --> 02:04:00,189
I don't know.

749
02:04:02,535 --> 02:04:04,435
I really don't know.

750
02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:14,970
(Starts engine )

751
02:04:17,216 --> 02:04:19,446
You said you'd be right back.

752
02:04:24,356 --> 02:04:26,415
I'm so sorry.

753
02:04:28,294 --> 02:04:30,353
Me too.

754
02:05:39,632 --> 02:05:41,463
Chuck!

755
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:45,895
Chuck!

756
02:05:47,706 --> 02:05:49,606
Chuck!

757
02:06:06,825 --> 02:06:08,952
I always knew you were alive.

758
02:06:09,028 --> 02:06:11,053
I knew it.

759
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:13,792
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that,

760
02:06:13,866 --> 02:06:15,891
that I had to let you go.

761
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:19,101
I love you.

762
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,707
You're the love of my life.

763
02:06:24,843 --> 02:06:26,868
I love you too, Kelly.

764
02:06:28,247 --> 02:06:30,272
More than you'll ever know.

765
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:32,576
Chuck?

766
02:07:40,052 --> 02:07:42,077
You have to go home.

767
02:08:31,203 --> 02:08:33,467
We both had done the math, and...

768
02:08:35,207 --> 02:08:37,038
Kelly added it all up.

769
02:08:39,678 --> 02:08:41,737
She knew she had to let me go.

770
02:08:41,847 --> 02:08:44,816
I added it up, knew that I'd...

771
02:08:46,085 --> 02:08:48,144
I'd lost her.

772
02:08:49,988 --> 02:08:53,082
Cos I was never gonna
get off that island.

773
02:08:55,194 --> 02:08:57,719
I was gonna die there,

774
02:08:57,796 --> 02:08:59,855
totally alone.

775
02:09:06,038 --> 02:09:09,974
I mean, I was gonna get sick or I was
gonna get injured or something.

776
02:09:13,045 --> 02:09:15,104
The only choice I had,

777
02:09:17,916 --> 02:09:20,384
the only thing I could control...

778
02:09:22,221 --> 02:09:24,985
was when and how...

779
02:09:25,057 --> 02:09:27,423
and where that was gonna happen.

780
02:09:27,526 --> 02:09:29,551
So...

781
02:09:31,096 --> 02:09:33,155
I made a rope.

782
02:09:35,234 --> 02:09:38,328
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

783
02:09:41,707 --> 02:09:43,971
But I had to test it, you know?

784
02:09:44,042 --> 02:09:46,772
Of course. You know me.

785
02:09:48,781 --> 02:09:54,083
And the weight of the log
snapped the limb of the tree.

786
02:09:54,153 --> 02:09:58,852
So I... I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

787
02:09:58,924 --> 02:10:01,620
I had power over nothing.

788
02:10:10,369 --> 02:10:14,305
And that's when this feeling came
over me like a warm blanket.

789
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:22,347
I knew, somehow...

790
02:10:22,414 --> 02:10:24,848
that I had to stay alive.

791
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:28,285
Somehow.

792
02:10:29,388 --> 02:10:31,856
I had to keep breathing,

793
02:10:34,126 --> 02:10:36,993
even though there was no reason
to hope.

794
02:10:38,497 --> 02:10:42,433
And all my logic said that I would
never see this place again.

795
02:10:47,005 --> 02:10:49,064
So that's what I did.

796
02:10:49,975 --> 02:10:52,307
I stayed alive.

797
02:10:52,411 --> 02:10:54,436
I kept breathing.

798
02:10:56,281 --> 02:10:59,079
Then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,

799
02:10:59,151 --> 02:11:05,579
because the tide came in,
gave me a sail.

800
02:11:10,195 --> 02:11:12,220
And now, here I am.

801
02:11:15,534 --> 02:11:19,561
I'm back...in Memphis,

802
02:11:19,638 --> 02:11:21,697
talking to you.

803
02:11:23,308 --> 02:11:25,742
I have ice in my glass.

804
02:11:32,551 --> 02:11:35,019
And I've lost her all over again.

805
02:11:42,461 --> 02:11:45,328
I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.

806
02:11:50,302 --> 02:11:54,033
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

807
02:12:00,879 --> 02:12:03,370
And I know what I have to do now.

808
02:12:05,951 --> 02:12:07,976
I gotta keep breathing.

809
02:12:10,522 --> 02:12:12,990
Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.

810
02:12:14,359 --> 02:12:17,021
Who knows what the tide could bring?

811
02:12:30,842 --> 02:12:33,310
# I gave a letter to the postman

812
02:12:34,413 --> 02:12:36,438
# He put it in his sack

813
02:12:38,216 --> 02:12:41,344
# Bright and early next mornin'

814
02:12:41,453 --> 02:12:44,183
# He brought my letter back

815
02:12:44,256 --> 02:12:45,883
# She wrote upon it

816
02:12:45,958 --> 02:12:47,983
# Return to sender

817
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:51,319
# Address unknown

818
02:12:53,565 --> 02:12:55,590
# No such number... #

819
02:13:22,461 --> 02:13:24,395
Hello!

820
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,427
Hello!

821
02:13:36,241 --> 02:13:38,368
(Whistles )

822
02:13:38,443 --> 02:13:40,707
FedEx!

823
02:14:47,846 --> 02:14:49,677
You look lost.

824
02:14:49,748 --> 02:14:51,409
I do?

825
02:14:51,483 --> 02:14:53,747
Where are you headed?

826
02:14:56,922 --> 02:14:59,390
Well, I was just about
to figure that out.

827
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:02,323
Well, that's 83 South.

828
02:15:02,427 --> 02:15:07,490
And this road here
will hook you up with I-40 East.

829
02:15:07,566 --> 02:15:09,591
If you turn right,

830
02:15:09,668 --> 02:15:13,570
that'll take you to
Amarillo, Flagstaff,

831
02:15:13,638 --> 02:15:15,606
California.

832
02:15:16,675 --> 02:15:18,700
And if you head back that direction,

833
02:15:18,777 --> 02:15:22,508
you'll find a whole lotta nothin'
all the way to Canada.

834
02:15:23,982 --> 02:15:25,813
I got it.

835
02:15:25,884 --> 02:15:27,943
All right, then.

836
02:15:30,522 --> 02:15:32,513
Good luck, cowboy.

837
02:15:32,591 --> 02:15:34,456
Thank you.
