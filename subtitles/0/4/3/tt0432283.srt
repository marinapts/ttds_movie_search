00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,411
FANTASTIC MR. FOX

2
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,712
<i> Born on a mountain top in Tennessee </i>

3
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,257
<i> Greenest state in the land of the free </i>

4
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,844
<i> Raised in the woods
so he knew every tree </i>

5
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,222
<i> Kilt him a bar
when he was only three </i>

6
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:43,979
<i> Davy, Davy Crockett,
king of the wild frontier! </i>

7
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,736
<i> Fought single-handed
through the Injun War </i>

8
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,364
<i> Till the Creeks was whipped
and peace was in store </i>

9
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,366
<i> And while he was handling... </i>

10
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,911
What'd the doctor say?
- Nothing.

11
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,205
Supposedly, it's just a
twenty-four hour bug.

12
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,289
He gave me some pills.

13
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,625
I told you. You probably
just ate some bad gristle.

14
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,335
We take the short cut
or the scenic route?

15
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,711
Let's take the short cut.

16
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,671
But the scenic route is so much prettier.

17
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,965
- Okay, let's take the scenic route.
- Great.

18
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,176
It's actually slightly quicker,
anyway.

19
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,229
Thank you.

20
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,865
- What is a squab?
- You know what a squab is.

21
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,617
It's like a pigeon, I suppose.

22
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,285
Should we go through the hole
under the horse fence...

23
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,037
...or climb the rail over the
bridle path?

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,540
Well, I guess the horse fence
would be a little safer.

25
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:48,502
But the bridle path puts us out right
next to the squab shack.

26
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,254
Okay.

27
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,215
What's wrong?
You're acting all skittish.

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,217
Don't worry. I've been stealing birds
for a living since...

29
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,552
...before I could trot.

30
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,054
By the way, you look
unbelievably beautiful tonight.

31
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,098
You're practically glowing.

32
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,724
Maybe it's the lighting.

33
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,144
<i> I've been in this town so long
that back in the city </i>

34
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,522
<i> I've been taken for lost and gone </i>

35
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:12,067
<i> And unknown for a long long time </i>

36
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,695
<i> Fell in love years ago </i>

37
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,363
<i> With an innocent girl </i>

38
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,991
<i> From the spanish and indian home </i>

39
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,702
<i> Home of the heroes and villains </i>

40
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,790
<i> Once at night
catillian squared the fight </i>

41
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,668
<i> And she was right in the rain
of the bullets </i>

42
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,921
<i> that eventually brought her down </i>

43
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,633
<i> But she's still dancing in the night </i>

44
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:42,431
<i> Unafraid of what a dudell do in a town
full of heroes and villains </i>

45
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,891
What's that?
- What?

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,100
I think it's a fox-trap!

47
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,602
- Look at this.
- No, get away from there.

48
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,853
Is it spring-loaded?

49
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,063
Yeah... yeah, I guess
if you come from over there,

50
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,524
...and you're standing at this door
to the squab shack,

51
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,942
...this little gadget probably
triggers the...

52
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,319
- What!?
- Move out of the way, darling.

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,197
- That's right where it's going to land.
- Stop it! Let's go!

54
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,412
No, it just falls straight right down...

55
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,416
- I guess it's not spring-loaded.
- I'm pregnant.

56
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:12,920
Wow!

57
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,796
We're gonna have a cub.

58
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,884
- Honey, that's great news.
- If we're still alive tomorrow...

59
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,598
If we're still alive tomorrow morning,

60
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,601
...I want you to find
another line of work.

61
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,020
Okay.

62
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,440
<i> My children were raised </i>

63
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,526
<i> You know they suddenly rise </i>

64
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,986
<i> They started slow long ago </i>

65
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:42,324
<i> Head to toe healthy weathy and wise </i>

66
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,589
Does anybody actually read my column?

67
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,800
- Do your friends ever talk about it?
- Of course.

68
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,469
In fact, Rabbit's ex-girlfriend
just said to me last week,

69
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,264
"I should read Foxy's column,"
but they don't get the Gazette.

70
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,433
- Ash! Let's get cracking!
- Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.

71
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,768
- I'm sick.
- You're not sick.

72
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,687
- I have a temperature.
- You don't have a temperature.

73
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,189
- I don't want to go.
- Hurry up. You're going to be late.

74
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,441
I love the way you handled that.

75
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,448
Your cousin Kristofferson's coming
on the sixth.

76
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,576
I want you to be extra nice to him

77
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,452
...because he's going through a very
hard time right now.

78
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,537
Where's he gonna sleep?

79
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,913
We're gonna make a bed for him
in your room.

80
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,332
I can't spare the space.
Put him in Dad's study.

81
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,210
Dad's study is occupied by Dad.

82
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:41,091
I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
It makes me feel poor.

83
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,011
We are poor...
but we're happy.

84
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,387
Comme-ci, comme-ca.

85
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,640
Anyway, the views are better
above ground.

86
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,894
Honey, I'm seven non-fox-years old now.

87
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,562
My father died at seven and a half.

88
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,023
I don't want to live in a hole anymore,

89
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,108
...and I'm going to do
something about it.

90
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,534
Well, I'm off.

91
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,828
Have a good day, my darlings!

92
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,166
You know, Foxes live in holes
for a reason.

93
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,627
Hm, yes, I know.

94
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,298
What're you wearing?

95
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,593
Why a cape with the
pants tucked into your socks?

96
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,266
I guess he's just...

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,185
...different.

98
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,402
Oh, hey, Mr. Fox.

99
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,696
Yes. Here it is.
This is the tree.

100
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,866
Come on over. This is...
Uh, I'm gonna call you back.

101
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,536
Obviously, it's first growth,
indigenous.

102
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:55,499
Original dirt floor, good bark,
skipping stone hearth... as you can see.

103
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:56,917
Kylie?

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,127
Kylie! What'd I tell you?
I'm showing the property.

105
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,505
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Oh, what time is it? I'm sorry.

106
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,716
This is Kylie. He's the super.
He's a little...

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,802
What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

108
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,264
Kylie? Kylie!

109
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,768
- Just minnows. Try one?
- Certainly. Thank you.

110
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,772
It's not exactly an evergreen, is it?

111
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,316
Aren't there any pines on the market
this side of the river?

112
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,236
But, pines are pretty hard to come by
in your price range.

113
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,280
What? What?
What's that?

114
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,876
May I ask what you do
for a living, Mr. Fox?

115
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,920
I used to steal birds,
but now I'm a newspaper man.

116
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,840
Oh, sure. I've seen your by-line.

117
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,010
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

118
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,095
- You're going? You're...
- Oh, and Kylie...

119
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,515
Thank you for the minnow.
It was superb.

120
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,192
Don't buy this tree, Foxy.

121
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,569
You're borrowing at nine and a half
with no fixed rate,

122
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,030
plus moving into the most
dangerous neighborhood in the country

123
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,656
...for someone of your type of species.

124
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,075
You're exaggerating, Badger.

125
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm sugar-coating it, man!
This is Boggis, Bunce, and Bean!

126
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,917
Three of the meanest, nastiest, ugliest
farmers in the history of this valley!

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,419
Really? Tell me about them.

128
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,671
Alright.

129
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,507
<i>Walt Boggis is a chicken farmer.</i>

130
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,509
<i>Probably the most successful in the world.</i>

131
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,011
<i>He weighs the same
as a young rhinoceros.</i>

132
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:35,307
<i>He eats three chickens every day for
breakfast, lunch, supper, and dessert.</i>

133
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,518
<i>That's twelve in total, per diem.</i>

134
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,811
<i>Nate Bunce is a duck and goose farmer.</i>

135
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,314
<i>He's approximately the size of a
pot-bellied dwarf,</i>

136
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,525
<i>...and his chin would be under water
in the shallow end...</i>

137
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,235
<i>...of any swimming pool
on the planet.</i>

138
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,153
<i>His food is home-made doughnuts...</i>

139
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,822
<i>...with smashed-up goose livers
injected into them.</i>

140
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,492
<i>Frank Bean is a turkey and apple farmer.</i>

141
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,953
<i>He invented his own species of each.</i>

142
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,206
<i>He lives on a liquid diet of strong,
alcoholic cider...</i>

143
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,291
<i>...which he makes from his apples.</i>

144
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,711
<i>He's as skinny as a pencil,
as smart as a whip...</i>

145
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:08,465
<i>...and possibly the scariest man
currently living.</i>

146
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,761
The local human children
sing a kind of...

147
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,805
...eerie little rhyme about him.

148
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,598
Here, listen to this.

149
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,725
<i>Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

150
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,811
<i>One fat, one short, one lean.</i>

151
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,063
<i>These horrible crooks,
so different in looks,</i>

152
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,524
<i>...were nonetheless equally mean.</i>

153
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,069
In summation, I think
you just got to not do it, man.

154
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:30,279
That's all.

155
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,782
I understand what you're saying,
and your comments are valuable,

156
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,326
...but I'm gonna ignore your advice.

157
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,787
The cuss you are!

158
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,832
The cuss am I?

159
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,209
- Are you cussing with me?
- No, you cussing with me?

160
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,878
- Don't cussing point at me!
- You can cuss yourself!

161
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,213
- You're not gonna cuss with me, you little cuss!
- Don't cuss with me!

162
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,433
- Just buy the tree.
- Okay.

163
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,351
Take a left and then to the right.
Set them down.

164
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,103
Just another batch.
Help that other guy over there.

165
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,189
Lift with legs not with your back.
Flip it sideways.

166
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,690
Don't try to be a superman here.

167
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,941
Alright. We got two circles.

168
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,401
We got the yellow circle
and the green circle.

169
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,403
Let's just keep them separate.
Hold it right there.

170
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,947
We need to bring about
two percent more in.

171
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,033
Good. Here we go.
A little bit more. A little bit more.

172
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:16,867
That's good.

173
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,911
Let's just that bottom structure
resettled in.

174
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,704
Let's bring in the side unit.
Watch out!

175
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,206
Try to be careful, you guys.

176
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,208
Don't... don't peel away the bark.

177
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,508
Hi.
- Hi.

178
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,948
He's slightly younger,
but he's a cuss of a lot bigger.

179
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:59,910
That's just genetics, I guess.
Ash has a littler body-type.

180
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,876
Go!

181
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,587
Watch this, Dad!

182
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,590
Well, well...

183
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,384
Good jump, Ash!

184
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,302
Remember to keep your tail tucked!

185
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,266
Still painting thunderstorms, I see.

186
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,643
Do you still feel poor?

187
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,271
Lesser.

188
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,367
Wow! Wow!
Look at that!

189
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,662
This kid's a natural!
I'm speechless, Kristofferson!

190
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,213
Plus, he knows karate.

191
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,345
Do you think I'm an athlete?

192
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,765
- What are you talking about?
- Well, you know, I think I'm an athlete,

193
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:07,102
...and sometimes I feel like
you guys don't see me that way.

194
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,355
What's the sub-text here?
Is he praying?

195
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,858
I think that's yoga.

196
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,696
How long is Kristofferson supposed to
stay with us?

197
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,282
- Until your uncle gets better.
- Right, but roughly...

198
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,950
...how long do we plan to
give him on that?

199
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,370
Double-pneumonia isn't even really
that big of a deal, is it?

200
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,789
Lower your voice, Ash.

201
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,091
Who am I, Kylie?

202
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,136
- Who how? What, now?
- Why a fox?

203
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,097
Why not a horse or a beetle
or a bald eagle?

204
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,100
I'm saying this more as, like,
existentialism, you know?

205
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:50,854
Who am I, and how can a fox ever
be happy without a, uh...

206
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:54,107
...you forgive the expression,
a chicken in its teeth?

207
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,777
I don't know what you're talking about,
but it sounds illegal.

208
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,946
Here, put this bandit hat on.

209
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,532
Maybe you're a medium.
Take it off for a min.

210
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,492
And don't wear it around the house.

211
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,870
And so it begins.

212
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,708
Do you mind if I slide my bedroll
slightly out from under the train set?

213
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,294
It's hard to sleep in that
corkscrew position.

214
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,048
There's a lot of attitudes
going on around here.

215
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,510
- Don't let me get one.
- No, it's only just that my spinal-cord

216
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,096
Sleep wherever you want, man.
Here, take my bed.

217
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,723
I'll just, uh,
I'll crawl under the book-case.

218
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,976
Who cares if I get splinters
in my ears?

219
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,936
- Never mind.
- Oh, you're gonna pout about it?

220
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,107
Because I've had it up to... here!
With the sad house guest routine.

221
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,574
Good night.

222
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,051
I used to do this professionally,
and I was very successful at it.

223
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,552
I had to get out of it
for personal reasons,

224
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:49,389
...but I've decided to secretly do
one last big job on the sly.

225
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,476
I'm bringing you in as my secretary
and personal assistant.

226
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,769
Okay!

227
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,397
This is actually kind of a big deal,
so don't just say, "OK!"

228
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,608
- Okay. Well, thank you.
- I'm gonna tape this for my records,

229
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,735
...so don't make a lot of sounds.

230
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,820
Meaning stop rocking.

231
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,407
Master Plan. Phase one.
Side A.

232
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,618
We'll start with Boggis's Chicken House.
Number one.

233
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,913
His only security is a few old
hunting beagles and a low stone wall.

234
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,581
Now a word about beagles...

235
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,500
Never look a beagle
directly in the eye.

236
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,001
- And if...
- Why not?

237
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,878
Beagles aren't so tough.

238
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,881
Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these
beagles has chronic rabies,

239
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,092
...which he's on medication for,
and if you get bit by him...

240
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,135
...you have to get shots in your stomach
for six months.

241
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,471
And, second... listen, I'm
not going to justify this to you.

242
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,223
Just pay attention
and stop interrupting me.

243
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,307
I'm taping this.

244
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,184
I picked some blueberries,
and laced each one...

245
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,520
...with ten milligrams of
high-potency sleeping powder.

246
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,021
Enough to tranquilize a gorilla.

247
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:41,066
- How do we make them eat it?
- Beagles love blueberries.

248
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,236
<i>Remember: they aren't very smart,
but they're incredibly paranoid</i>

249
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,989
<i>...so always kill a chicken
in one bite.</i>

250
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,241
One bite, get it?

251
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,327
Are you listening to me?
I look into your eyes...

252
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,205
...and I cant tell whether you're
getting anything I'm saying.

253
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,335
Magnesium.

254
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,338
- Magnesium!
- Sorry.

255
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:05,924
Pipette.

256
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,885
- Pipette.
- Oh, sorry.

257
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,096
Potassium tri...
What are you looking at?

258
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,556
Oh, no.

259
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,476
Why's your cousin
such a wet-sandwich?

260
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,228
- I beg your pardon?
- What's that mean?

261
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,771
That means I didn't understand
what you just said.

262
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,815
- A wet-sandwich?
- Yeah, a wet-sandwich.

263
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,443
He's too short.
He dresses like a girl. He's...

264
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,402
...different.

265
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,488
Are you a bully?
You're starting to sound like a bully.

266
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,240
Watch this.

267
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,660
You've just destroyed
the whole experiment.

268
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,579
We'd better extinguish this magnesium.

269
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:36,997
Stand back.

270
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,791
Wow!

271
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:46,965
I like your ears.
- Mine?

272
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,968
- Thank you! I like your spots!
- Really?

273
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,930
I used to cover them up.
But, you know...

274
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,933
You're supposed to be my lab partner.

275
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,393
- I am!
- No, you're not.

276
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,312
You're disloyal.

277
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,127
A few beagles, as we discussed,
but we're ready for that.

278
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,964
Yeah, but back in the old days,

279
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,132
didn't they used to do a thing
where if somebody saw a wolf, and...

280
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,176
Wolf? What wolf?

281
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,930
Oh, nothing? Never mind.

282
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,767
Here comes the low stone wall.
Not a problem.

283
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,481
What the cuss?
Where'd this giant fence come from?

284
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,526
- We had a master plan!
- What's this lightning bolt?

285
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,446
That could mean maybe this fence
might be electric.

286
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,325
Well, I just hope it doesn't mean thunder.
Because I have a phobia of that.

287
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,670
Watch this.

288
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,321
Beagles love blueberries!
Didn't I tell you?

289
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,489
The master plan's working again!

290
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,408
Now! This is the tricky part.

291
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,202
One of us got to jump
that barbed-wire,

292
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:41,038
...slide under the tire-spikes,
and flip open the fence-latch.

293
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,706
- Who's it gonna be?
- Not me.

294
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,875
You know who could do this part
easily is Kristofferson.

295
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,502
That kid's like a professional,
Olympic-level...

296
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,129
Why don't we go around that way?
There's no obstacles.

297
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,049
Yeah. That's better.

298
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,727
- I said one bite!
- I'm trying!

299
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,605
I have a different kind of teeth
from you! I'm an opossum!

300
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,649
Give me that.

301
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,236
That's so grisly!
There's blood and everything!

302
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,695
Follow me.

303
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,713
Hey, what's the master escape plan?

304
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,635
Follow me again!

305
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,809
Quick!

306
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:46,854
Give me that.

307
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,908
Alright. Let's hit the five
and dime on the way home!

308
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,536
We need to make some fake price tags
and wrap these chickens in wax-paper

309
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,913
...so it looks like we got them
at the butcher shop!

310
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:15,924
Where'd you get this chicken?

311
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,427
I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime
last night on my way back...

312
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,430
It's got a Boggis Farms tag
around its ankle.

313
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,100
Must've escaped from there
before I bought it.

314
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,235
It's Bunce tonight! He's got a
refrigerated smokehouse with

315
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,195
- a hundred geese...
- Woah! Woah!

316
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:39,323
I thought you said we were only
doing one last big job.

317
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:43,744
We are, but it's... not done yet.
It's a triple-header.

318
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,075
Let see some hustle!

319
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,661
Coach, we don't have whack-bat
where I'm from. What're the rules?

320
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,871
There's no whack-bat
on the other side of the river!?

321
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:31,500
No, we mostly just run grass sprints
or play acorns.

322
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,793
Well, it's real simple:

323
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,004
basically, there's three grabbers,
three taggers, five twig-runners,

324
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,256
...and the player at whack-bat.

325
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,675
The center-tagger lights the
pine-cone and chucks it over the basket,

326
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,344
...and the whack-batter tries to hit the
cedar-stick off the cross-rock.

327
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:45,222
Then the twig-runners dash back and forth
until the pine-cone burns out,

328
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,682
...and the umpire calls "hot box".

329
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,559
Finally, at the end you
count up however many score-downs

330
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,269
...it adds up to and divide that by nine.

331
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,728
- Got it!
- Go in for Ash.

332
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:52,980
Substitution!

333
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,482
Ash, come out!
You need a breather.

334
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,526
What? I'm out!
What?

335
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,028
I still feel good, Coach!
Let me finish this eighth!

336
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,240
No, come on. Step out.
Step out. Let's go.

337
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,743
Am I getting better, Coach?

338
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,163
Well, you're sure as cuss
not getting any worse.

339
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:13,375
Really? You think I'd end up being as
good as my dad if I keep practicing?

340
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,418
Your dad?

341
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:19,464
Your dad was probably the best
whack-bat player we ever had in this school.

342
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,263
No, you don't wanna
have to compare yourself to that.

343
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:30,934
Yeah, but I think I've some of the same
raw natural talent, don't you?

344
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,937
You're improving.
Let's put it like that.

345
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,174
Hot box!
- Divide that by nine, please!

346
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:06,261
Yeah! That's the first time this
kid's ever swung a whack-bat?

347
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,555
He really is your father's nephew,
isn't he?

348
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:09,640
Not by blood.

349
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,767
- No?
- He's from my mother's side.

350
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,227
Oh, yeah.

351
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:16,063
What's that stand for?

352
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,899
Huh? It's for...
It's for pep.

353
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,692
Pep? It's a K.

354
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,403
Come on, now!
Look alive! Attaboy!

355
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,822
We're going steady.

356
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,162
What's that?
- What "what"?

357
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:33,413
What this?

358
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:36,917
It's nothing. It's just some old trophy
I won for being an athlete.

359
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,004
I'm supposed to cover this book party
at some animal's nest

360
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,464
...in a tobacco field down the hill,

361
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,092
...so me and Kylie are going to hop
over there and give it a whirl.

362
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,803
- Don't wait up.
- What's the book?

363
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,973
Some memoir.
I'll get him to sign you a copy.

364
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,391
Dinner was...

365
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,226
...pitch-perfect.

366
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,526
I spotted a couple of
broken burglar bars...

367
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,820
...underneath the back door
to Bean's secret cider cellar.

368
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,738
- We're breaking into Bean's house?
- Cellar.

369
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,657
- Where he lives?
- Where he keeps the cider.

370
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,118
- Below where he lives.
- Where'd you come from?

371
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,369
Go back to the tree
and do your homework!

372
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,080
- I wanna help you steal some cider.
- We're going to a book party!

373
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,666
And keep your mouth shut about any cider,
because no one ever said that.

374
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,001
- Now get out of here!
- But...

375
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,211
But nothing! You're gonna
get me in a lot of trouble!

376
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,714
Besides you're too little
and uncoordinated.

377
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,676
One, two, three.

378
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,180
Where the cuss does that kid get off?

379
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,932
Can you believe that?
How did he get tipped off?

380
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,770
You think he's going to tell on us?

381
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,232
Before we go any further, from now on
can you give me some kind of signal...

382
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:45,402
...once in a while just so I know
any of this is getting through to you?

383
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:50,449
- Was that it? Okay, fine.
- There's another one.

384
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,575
Good. You made it.

385
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,494
- Anybody see you?
- I don't think so.

386
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:55,579
Here, put this bandit hat on.

387
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,249
I must say, I'm pleased to be invited,
but I'm not sure...

388
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,001
- I should be doing this, Uncle Foxy!
- Why not?

389
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:03,045
Because I don't like to be
dishonest with people!

390
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:05,047
Well, just keep your mouth shut,
and it won't be a problem!

391
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,590
Yeah, but I don't think
he should come with us, either.

392
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,258
We're not taking a vote!

393
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,095
You know, one time
this wolf I saw...

394
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:15,516
Wolf? What's with all the wolf talk?
Can we give it a rest, for once?

395
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:31,698
- Look at all this. Apple juice.
- Apple juice? Apple juice?

396
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,200
We didn't come here for apple juice.

397
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:37,037
This is some of the strongest, finest
alcoholic cider money can buy...

398
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,997
...or that can even be stolen.

399
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:41,667
It burns in your throat,
boils in your stomach,

400
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,796
...and tastes almost exactly like
pure, melted gold.

401
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:58,392
Y'all are trespassing, now.
Illegally.

402
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:08,652
Around these parts, we don't take kindly
to cider poachers.

403
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,821
You've aged badly, Rat.

404
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:15,200
You're getting a little long
in the tooth, yourself, partner.

405
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,788
Bean security, what?
Why you're wearing that badge?

406
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,415
What is it?

407
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,251
It's my job.

408
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,767
How's your old lady doing?

409
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:43,312
Do you refer to my wife?

410
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:46,315
She was the town tart, in her day.

411
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:48,901
Wild and foot-loose and...

412
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,111
...pretty as a mink stole.

413
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,821
Is that true?

414
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,031
Of course, not.

415
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,283
I mean, certainly, she lived.
We all did.

416
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,494
It was a different time.
Let's not use a double-standard.

417
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:00,704
- She marched against the...
- But town tart?

418
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,080
Shut up.

419
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,792
That was close, Rat.
Be careful.

420
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,087
Oh, I'm as careful as a...

421
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,406
How many jars should I bring up,
Franklin?

422
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:38,116
I don't know.
Two, I guess.

423
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:40,327
You drank three yesterday, though.

424
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:43,205
Alright, take three.

425
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:55,843
No, two's plenty.

426
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,891
Oh, my cuss.
Is she blind?

427
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,351
I think she might have astigmatism.

428
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,436
Or possibly a cataract of some form.

429
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,522
Anyway, her eyes don't see well.

430
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:25,080
What'd I tell you?
This kid's a natural, am I right?

431
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,087
It's so good of you to come.
Lovely to see you.

432
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,422
Youre both looking splendid.

433
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:36,049
How've you been, Walter?
In good health, I trust?

434
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,636
Nathan? All is well?
Wonderful.

435
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,431
Any fox problems?

436
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,474
- Are you joking?
- It's horrible.

437
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,559
- We're miserable.
- He's laughing at us.

438
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,768
- It's humiliating.
- We're furious.

439
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,812
I don't even want to talk about it.

440
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,238
Perhaps we ought to kill him.

441
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,158
- Well, that seems rather obvious.
- He's too sneaky.

442
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:04,703
Ah, right. Of course.
He's very clever, isn't he?

443
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,164
Might be bit difficult, I suppose.

444
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,425
But I've already figured out
where this fox lives,

445
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,219
...and tomorrow night
we're gonna camp in the bushes,

446
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,845
...wait for him to come out
of the hole in his tree,

447
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:23,805
...and shoot the cuss to smithereens.

448
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,891
How's that grab you, fellas?

449
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,685
Yeah. Well, let's see.
Why not?

450
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,490
Another book party?

451
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:46,495
Woah! I didn't see you,
sitting in the dark over there.

452
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:49,164
Yeah, no. Actually,
there's a fire.

453
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:51,583
I just got the call.
They said maybe it's arson?

454
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,168
I got to interview the marshall
and see what's...

455
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,755
Kylie, is he telling the truth?

456
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,841
I don't want to be
put in the middle of this.

457
00:29:58,882 --> 00:29:59,883
Thanks, Kylie.

458
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,428
Why is he wearing that bandit hat?

459
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,391
His ears were cold.
He's not with us.

460
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,059
Go back to bed.

461
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:13,355
If what I think is happening
is happening...

462
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:15,399
...it better not be.

463
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,502
Nice job covering for me.
Next time, you...

464
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:50,726
All three!

465
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:52,019
Kill him!

466
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:18,045
We got the tail,
but we missed the fox.

467
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,715
Petey! Sorry to wake you.

468
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,343
I can trouble you to dash out here
right away with, shall we say,

469
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:28,347
...three shovels, two pick-axes,
500 rounds of ammunition and, uh...

470
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,265
...a bottle of apple-cider.

471
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:34,311
It'll grow back, won't it?
- Tails don't grow back.

472
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,563
- Tails don't grow back.
- Except for lizards.

473
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,065
Tails don't grow back.

474
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:40,442
I'm gonna be tailless
for the rest of my life.

475
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,362
Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as
double-pneumonia, right?

476
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,615
I mean, his dad's got one foot in the grave
and three feet on a banana peel.

477
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,742
That's a lot worse than...

478
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,706
Excuse me, everyone. I'm gonna go
meditate for half an hour.

479
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,710
You've got twenty-nine minutes
to come up with a proper apology.

480
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,296
Me? Me, have an apology?

481
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,340
He gets a bandit hat! He just got here
and he got a bandit hat!

482
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:06,134
Where's my bandit hat?
Why didn't I get shot at?

483
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:09,179
It's because, you, you...
you think I'm no good at anything!

484
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,348
Well, maybe you're right!
Thanks!

485
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,686
I told you not to bring him.

486
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:18,021
Why the cuss didn't I listen
to my lawyer?

487
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,232
At this point we'll be lucky
if we can flip this tree for...

488
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,401
...half of what we've
already sunk into it.

489
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,945
I won't be able to sleep
on my back for six weeks...

490
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,864
...and on my stomach
I feel congested.

491
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,324
Why the cuss didn't I listen
to my lawyer?

492
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:31,869
Because you don't listen to anybody.

493
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,830
- What was that?
- What? I said...

494
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:36,999
Wake up! Everybody!
They're digging us out!

495
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,418
- They'll kill the children!
- Over my dead body, they will.

496
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,587
That's what I'm saying!
You'd be dead, too, in that scenario!

497
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,422
- Well, I'm arguing against that!
- What are you talking about?

498
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,257
- Why are you yelling at me?
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

499
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,219
You say one thing, she says another,
and it all changes back again!

500
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:00,898
I've got it!
There's not a moment to lose!

501
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,275
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- Think of what?

502
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,194
We've been trapped before.

503
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,363
Dig!

504
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:31,803
I think it's time for me to give us
a pep talk and explain some things.

505
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:35,390
- A very long time ago...
- May I have a word with you privately?

506
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,267
Well, we're in a hole.

507
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:39,603
Just on the other side of this
mineral deposit.

508
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:40,979
Follow me.

509
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,193
I'm gonna lose my temper now.

510
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,654
- When?
- Right now.

511
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,697
Well, when...
Oh, my God!

512
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:57,246
Twelve fox-years ago,
you made a promise to me...

513
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,290
while we were caged inside
that fox-trap, that if we survived

514
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:03,293
you would never steal another chicken,
goose, turkey, duck,

515
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,920
...or squab, whatever they are.

516
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:09,508
And I believed you. Why?
Why did you lie to me?

517
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:15,514
- Because I'm a wild animal
- You're also a husband and a father.

518
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:19,101
I'm trying to tell you the truth
about myself.

519
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:22,062
I don't care about the truth
about yourself.

520
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:25,858
This story is too predictable.

521
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,695
Predictable? Really?
What happens in the end!?

522
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:33,073
In the end, we all die...

523
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:35,951
...unless you change.

524
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:51,717
Petey, listen.

525
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,344
Run down to the rentals department
over at Malloy Consolidated...

526
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,096
...and place an order for,
shall we say,

527
00:34:56,263 --> 00:35:01,602
one Mighty Max, one Junior Spitfire,
and a long-range Tornado 375 Turbo.

528
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,270
For immediate delivery.

529
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,977
Ash, are you mad at me?

530
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:45,479
I understand if you are,
and I'm sorry.

531
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,690
I wouldn't have ever involved your cousin
if I realized you would feel this way.

532
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:51,401
It was only ever just because
he's kind of a natural, I mean...

533
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,403
Hey, look at him dig!

534
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,825
- Anyway, I'm sorry your feelings...
- You know what?

535
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:59,493
I'm gonna put dirt in my ears.

536
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,954
Yeah, that's better.
I can't hear you now but keep talking.

537
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,186
I don't have beagle ticks,
by the way.

538
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,815
Whoa! Me, neither.
Whoever said we've beagle...

539
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:32,568
Apparently, that's what
you've been telling everyone.

540
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,486
Beagle ticks and pelt lice.

541
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:36,738
I never said that,
and you're misquoting me...

542
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,783
...or somebody is, but I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

543
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:42,286
Look, Ash, we may or may not
ever see the light of day again,

544
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,997
...but I really like Agnes,
and I think she likes me.

545
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,291
Great. She's a free agent.
What do I care?

546
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,627
- Well, then why're you dead-set on...
- Can I ask you a question?

547
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,754
- You may.
- What's the point of sitting on the floor...

548
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,798
with your legs twisted into a pretzel
talking to yourself...

549
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,217
...for an hour and forty-five minutes?
It's weird.

550
00:36:57,301 --> 00:37:00,262
My father and I first started practicing
meditation together when I was...

551
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,180
Yeah? Well, that's great.

552
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:03,640
But I'd worry more about what
that does for your reputation...

553
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,310
...than whether or not
you have beagle ticks or not.

554
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:10,272
I don't. Nor pelt lice.

555
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:17,696
One of those slovenly farmers is probably
wearing my tail as a necktie by now.

556
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,239
You're paranoid, Foxy.

557
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:20,407
<i>Farmer, thank you.</i>

558
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:22,242
<i>Correct me if am misreading the data,</i>

559
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:25,454
<i>you've successfully destroyed the
scenery, but the alleged fox</i>

560
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,289
Look at Dad's tie.

561
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,791
<i>What will you three prominent
farmers do now?</i>

562
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,294
<i>Well, Dan, I can tell you
what we're not going to do.</i>

563
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,338
<i>We're not gonna let him go.</i>

564
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:49,061
Stand clear, please.
Stand clear, everyone.

565
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,812
Contact!

566
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,787
Boggis, how many men,
did you got working on your farm?

567
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:07,704
- Thirty five.
- Bunce?

568
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,790
- Thirty six.
- And I've got thirty-seven. That's...

569
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,877
I'd say, a hundred and eight altogether.

570
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,171
Petey!

571
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,131
Drop everything and assemble all
hundred and eight members...

572
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,300
...of our entire
three combined work-forces.

573
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,261
Were gonna starve them out
and then kill them.

574
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:26,640
Starting in, shall we say,
fifteen minutes.

575
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:30,060
<i>An estimated,
a hundred and eight snipers are...</i>

576
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:33,647
<i>...currently in position surrounding
the demolished fox residence.</i>

577
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,692
<i>Many local animals, who'd appear
to be trapped underground,</i>

578
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,902
...without provisions of any kind
at this point.

579
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:43,657
If I had a crystal ball, I'd predict
a fairly grisly outcome to the situation.

580
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,868
<i>But we stand on the scene,
watching closely,</i>

581
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:48,537
<i>...as events continue to unfold.</i>

582
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:53,667
This is gonna be a total cluster cuss
for everybody.

583
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:02,885
How long can a fox go
without food or water?

584
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:04,761
Well, I can only answer as an opossum,

585
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,847
...but I don't think I can last more than
another couple of hours..

586
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,558
...before I get completely dehydrated
and starve to death.

587
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,185
What's that?

588
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,402
- Dad?
- Not a sound.

589
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,830
You scared the cuss out of us!

590
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,793
A lot of good animals are
probably gonna die...

591
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:38,754
...because of you.

592
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,966
We've been digging in circles
for three days.

593
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:45,427
Half the woods have been obliterated.
Nobody can get out.

594
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,763
Right now my wife's huddled
at the bottom of the flint-mine...

595
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:52,559
with no food, no water, and
twenty seven starving animal brats!

596
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,478
I just want to see a little...

597
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,188
...sunshine.

598
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:57,648
But you're nocturnal, Phil.

599
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,733
Your eyes barely even open,
on a good day.

600
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:02,486
I'm sick of your double-talk.
We have rights!

601
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,404
We don't like you,
and we hate your dad.

602
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,115
Now grab some of that mud, chew it
in your mouth, and swallow it.

603
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,827
- I'm not gonna eat mud!
- Cuss, yeah, you are.

604
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,710
Don't do that.

605
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:20,546
Why'd you take your shoes off?

606
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:23,257
So I don't break your nose
when I kick it.

607
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,143
I can fight my own fights.

608
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,312
No, you can't.

609
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:38,897
Those farmers aren't gonna quit...

610
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,774
...until they've got you and
every member of your family...

611
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:44,486
...nailed upside-down to a bloody stick
with your eyes gorged out.

612
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,990
This is getting a little too personal.

613
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,409
Give me a minute.

614
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,092
I've got an idea.

615
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,510
- What is it?
- It could be a good one.

616
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,137
- Lay it on us.
- It might save our lives.

617
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:11,889
Say the idea!

618
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:14,183
Alright! Let's try it!

619
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:19,396
Go to the flint-mine. Tell Mrs. Badger,
et al. that help is on the way.

620
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:21,023
Is help on the way?

621
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:23,525
I sure as cuss hope so.

622
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:32,993
Ash, I know what it's like to feel...

623
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,579
...different.

624
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:39,833
I'm not different, am I?

625
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,460
We all are.

626
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:43,128
Him, especially.

627
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:46,757
But there's something kind of fantastic
about that, isn't there?

628
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:55,766
Not to me.
I'd prefer to be an athlete.

629
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:02,356
Gentlemen, this time we must dig
in a very special direction.

630
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,613
I got to kind of feel out the vibe.

631
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:14,993
Begin.

632
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,355
Come on!

633
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:52,614
I hit it slap in the middle!
Do you get how incredible this is?

634
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:58,745
<i>About a handsome little fox,
Let me sing you folks a yarn.</i>

635
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:03,250
<i>Hey, diddle-dee, doddle-do,
doodle-dum!</i>

636
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:07,254
<i>It was a splendid little feller,
Full of wit 'n' grace 'n' charm.</i>

637
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:11,175
<i>Say, zippy-zee, yappy-yo,
google-gum!</i>

638
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:16,388
<i>Well, like any little critter needing
Vittels for his littl'uns.</i>

639
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:21,685
<i>Well, he stole, and he cheated,
And he lied to survive.</i>

640
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:27,191
<i>Doodle-dum, diddle-die,
doddle-diddle-doodle-dee!</i>

641
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:30,944
<i>Zippy-zo, zippy-zay,
zippy-zappy-zoopy-zee!</i>

642
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:33,739
<i>Doodle-dum, Doodle-dum</i>

643
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:37,201
<i>Let me take a little tick now
To color in the scene,</i>

644
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:42,080
<i>Across the valley lived three yokels
Name of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

645
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:44,416
<i>Now these three crazy jackies
had our hero on the run</i>

646
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,502
<i>Shot the tail off the cuss
With a fox-shooting gun.</i>

647
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:48,587
<i>But that stylish little fox
Was as clever as a whip.</i>

648
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:52,674
<i>Dug as quick as a gopher
Who was a hyper-ack-a-tive.</i>

649
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:58,847
<i>Now those three farmers sit
It where there's a hole, it was once a hill.</i>

650
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:02,392
<i>Singing, diddle-dee, doddle-do,
doodle-dum!</i>

651
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:07,356
<i>And as far as I can reckon
They're a-setting up there still.</i>

652
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:10,818
<i>Singing, zippy-zee, yappy-yo,</i>

653
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,195
What are you singing, Petey?

654
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:17,199
Just... just making up one
as I went along, really.

655
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,535
That's just weak song-writing!

656
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:22,329
You wrote a bad song, Petey!

657
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:43,267
We took everything.

658
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,310
They took everything?

659
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,855
Let me call you back, Petey.

660
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:52,568
- Well, they'd be anywhere by now.
- They're digging right under our feet.

661
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:54,236
Well, in a sense,
we've only made matters worse.

662
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:56,280
We should have stayed out of it.

663
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:30,689
I've got an idea.

664
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:41,408
I'm still not getting a signal.
Is anyboby getting any reception?

665
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,286
I don't have any signal,
but I've got a problem.

666
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:46,121
Crisp up those ducks.
Aye, drag those chickens.

667
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:47,998
Slow them down just a little bit,
we're a little ahead.

668
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,791
Where are the apples? Stiil out?
You still have them raw?

669
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,418
Well, slice them up.
Let's get them in the pantry.

670
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:55,589
I can imagine how painful, even just
emotionally, that must be for you.

671
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,132
Well, you know,
it's not the end of the world.

672
00:45:57,216 --> 00:46:01,136
Oh, but Foxy, how humiliating!
Having your whole tail blown clean off...

673
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,222
Can we drop it?

674
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:08,393
Yeah, it's really good.
Sweet and nice.

675
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,730
Hey, they say you're a natural.
True or false?

676
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:13,232
- I just...
- Answer the question.

677
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,108
- True, I guess
- Correct.

678
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:17,611
Get out of here, Agnes. I need to
have a private word with Kristofferson.

679
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:21,240
- Just a minute. She doesn't...
- I don't mind. I'm gonna go talk to them.

680
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:24,117
Listen to me, I just had
a brainstorm for something...

681
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:27,120
...fantastic I've got to do.
But I can't do it alone.

682
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:28,705
- I'm not interested.
- Hear me out.

683
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:29,540
No, thanks.

684
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:32,584
I think foxes from your side of the family
take unnecessary risks.

685
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:35,128
Only because they got the guts
in their blood...

686
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:36,630
...and so do we.

687
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,466
- Was I a bit rude to Agnes?
- Yeah.

688
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:42,803
I'd probably say something I shoudn't.
I'll say something to her in a minute.

689
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,515
- What's the brainstorm?
- In a nutshell?

690
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:49,560
We're gonna steal back my dad's tail.

691
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:03,198
Okay, chief.
- Here we go.

692
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:18,755
Well, it took a near catastrophe
for all of you to finally...

693
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:21,633
...take me up on my offer to have you
over to the flint-mine for dinner.

694
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:22,676
- but I guess we have...
- I'm sorry.

695
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:24,720
Maybe my invitation got lost
in the mail.

696
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:27,306
Does anybody know what this
badger's talking about?

697
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:28,182
Hey, hold on.

698
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:30,267
But Clive's right.
In all seriousness.

699
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:31,476
Excuse me, B.

700
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:35,981
I guess we do have these
three ugly farmers to thank for one thing:

701
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:39,193
...reminding us to be thankful
and aware of each other.

702
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:41,945
I'm gonna say it again.
Aware.

703
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:58,712
I don't feel safe.
- That's because we're not.

704
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,256
You should probably
put on your bandit hat now.

705
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:05,010
Personally, I don't have one,
but I modified this tube sock.

706
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,556
- We look good.
- Yeah, we do.

707
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,391
Now where would you keep
a prized tail,

708
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,268
if you collected them,
if that was your hobby?

709
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:15,187
I'd probably hang it over
the mantelpiece.

710
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:19,024
Right. Good. In fact...
what's that smell?

711
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:25,030
Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's famous
nutmeg-ginger-apple-snaps?

712
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:27,866
Well, I didn't do.

713
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:36,667
They are still warm.

714
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:42,548
- We got it wrong.
- What?

715
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,591
It's not over the mantelpiece...

716
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:46,969
The necktie.

717
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,831
- Let's go. What?
- Hang on. I wanna do more.

718
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:17,916
- She's there!
- She can't see.

719
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:27,384
Look at each other.
Here we are. Wow!

720
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:30,220
Now I've already had too much to drink,
and I'm feeling sentimental,

721
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:32,890
but I'm gonna say something, anyway,
which nobody wants to admit,

722
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:34,933
...but I think is probably true.

723
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:37,019
We beat them.

724
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,938
We beat those farmers,
and now we're triumphantly eating

725
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,815
...their roasted chicken,
their sizzling duck,

726
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:45,402
...their succulent turkey,
their foie gras de...

727
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:48,572
- Where did the boys go?
- What? Where?

728
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:51,116
- Ash? Kristofferson?
- Boys?

729
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:54,411
Oh, my God! That was crazy!
I can't believe what just happened in there.

730
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:55,662
Come on, let's go out of here!
Let's go!

731
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:58,332
<i>Where are we? Where are we?
Where are we? What?</i>

732
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:02,377
Kristofferson?

733
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:05,047
What am I hearing again, baby?
What's happening?

734
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:06,673
Am I still paranoid?

735
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,762
Cider?

736
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:35,077
What just happened?

737
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,870
Something with cider.
That was dangerous.

738
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:38,622
- Is anyone hurt?
- We're all hurt!

739
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:41,124
My entire flint-mine just got demolished.

740
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,293
Apple juice.
Apple juice flood.

741
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,671
Let's do a head-count!
Everybody pick a buddy!

742
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:46,880
Where did the boys go?

743
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:47,965
- Ash?
- Ash?

744
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:49,424
Kristofferson? Ash!?

745
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:51,051
I'm here!

746
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:52,845
Ash! Who's your buddy?

747
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:54,221
- Kristofferson.
- Where is he?

748
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:55,013
- I don't know.
- Why not?

749
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,890
- I lost him!
- You lost him?

750
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:58,934
- I, uh, I was in the kitchen...
- Where were you?

751
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:02,020
- We were trying to find the necktie.
- What are you talking about?

752
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:04,356
- It's my fault.
- Oh, no.

753
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:06,775
Where did you that
nutmeg-ginger-apple-snap?

754
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:09,403
And why are you wearing that
fake bandit hat!?

755
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:11,488
We went to steal back your tail.

756
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:19,830
- Kristofferson! Kristofferson!
- Kristofferson! Kristofferson!

757
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:25,836
Wrap this wet, little mutt
in a newspaper...

758
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:29,131
...and put him in a box with
some holes punched in the top.

759
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,467
There's only one way out of this sewer,
but the manhole cover's closed,

760
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:34,136
...and there's a station wagon
parked on it.

761
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:36,847
Which means we're permanently
stuck down here.

762
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,809
You still think we beat them, Foxy?

763
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:00,162
Badger's right.

764
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,915
These farmers aren't gonna quit
until they catch me.

765
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,458
I shouldn't have lied to your face.

766
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,918
I shouldn't have fallen off
the wagon...

767
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,587
...and started secretly
stealing chickens on the sly.

768
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,590
I shouldn't have pushed these farmers
so far and tried to embarrass them

769
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:13,217
...and cuss with their heads.

770
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:15,093
I enjoyed it,
but I shouldn't have done it.

771
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,179
And now theres only one way out.

772
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:19,723
Maybe if I hand myself over
and let them kill me,

773
00:52:19,765 --> 00:52:21,767
...stuff me, and hang me
over their mantelpiece.

774
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:22,976
You'll do no such thing.

775
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,687
Darling, maybe they'll let
everyone else live.

776
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:31,276
Oh, why did you have to get us
into this, Foxy?

777
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:35,697
I don't know,
but I have a possible theory.

778
00:52:36,198 --> 00:52:38,200
I think I have this thing where I
need everybody to think...

779
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:41,829
I'm the greatest...
the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox.

780
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:44,081
And if they aren't completely
knocked-out and dazzled,

781
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:46,124
...and kind of intimidated
by me, then...

782
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,210
I don't feel good about myself.

783
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:51,547
Foxes traditionally like to
court danger, hunt prey,

784
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:55,175
...and outsmart predators.
And that's what I'm actually good at!

785
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:57,761
I think, at the end of the day,
I'm just...

786
00:52:57,803 --> 00:52:59,096
I know.

787
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,348
We're wild animals.

788
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,726
I guess we always were.

789
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:07,855
I promise you,
if I had all this to do over again,

790
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:09,523
I'd have never let you down.

791
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,526
It was always more fun
when we did it together, anyway.

792
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:17,281
- I love you, Felicity.
- I love you, too.

793
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:21,785
But I shouldn't have married you.

794
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:33,797
Did I ever tell you about the time
I learned we were gonna have a cub?

795
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,424
- In the fox-trap.
- Right.

796
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:37,593
- We were at gunpoint, and your mother...
- said she's pregnant.

797
00:53:37,676 --> 00:53:38,969
Let me tell it, okay?

798
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:42,264
I had no idea how we were gonna
get out of this jam, and...

799
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:45,142
...then it hit me: what do foxes do better
than any other animal?

800
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:46,560
- Dig.
- You're stepping on my lines.

801
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:47,478
Right, keep telling it.

802
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:50,314
So we dug. And the whole time
I put paw over paw,

803
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:53,775
...scooping dirt and pebbles with
your mother digging like crazy beside me,

804
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,653
I kept wondering:
who is this little boy gonna be?

805
00:53:56,737 --> 00:53:57,905
- Or girl.
- Or girl, right.

806
00:53:57,988 --> 00:53:59,990
Because at that point we didn't know.

807
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:03,994
Ash, I'm so glad he was you.

808
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:08,081
It's not your fault...
it's mine.

809
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:31,480
Goodbye.

810
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,945
Well, I guess we should, uh...

811
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:41,198
...probably split into a
certain number of groups...

812
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,243
...and start doing something, right?

813
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,918
Can I have a glass of water?

814
00:54:55,963 --> 00:54:58,590
Excuse me!
Excuse me?

815
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,635
Kristofferson?
Hello?

816
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:03,762
Can you hear us?

817
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:05,681
Kristofferson?

818
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,891
<i>They got the boy.</i>

819
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:15,607
They want to trade the son
for his poppa.

820
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,823
Why'd they write this in letters
cut out of magazines?

821
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,283
To protect their identities.

822
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:27,327
Oh, right, but then
why did they sign their names?

823
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:29,997
Plus, we already knew who they were
because they're trying to kill us.

824
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,332
Mr. Fox, we have your son.

825
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:34,084
If you ever want to see him
alive again...

826
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:36,420
<i>You took the wrong fox.</i>

827
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,175
I'm his son.

828
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,803
I can see the resemblance.

829
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:49,183
What's that?
- Help!

830
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,161
Come on, man!
Come on!

831
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:17,669
Look at you, girl!

832
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:22,216
You're still as fine looking
as a creme brulee.

833
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:26,512
Am I being flirted with
by a psychotic rat?

834
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,358
Excuse me, may I cut-in?

835
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:16,270
The boy is locked in an apple crate
on top of a gunlocker...

836
00:57:16,353 --> 00:57:19,898
...in the attic of Bean Annex.

837
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:24,111
Would you have told me
if I didn't kill you first?

838
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:26,196
Never.

839
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:29,199
All these wasted years.

840
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:31,702
What were you looking for, Rat?

841
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:34,997
He's trying to say something, Dad.

842
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:37,875
Cider.

843
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:44,339
Here you are, Rat.

844
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:48,468
A beaker of Bean's finest secret cider.

845
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:55,184
Like melted gold.

846
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:06,111
He redeemed himself.

847
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,322
Redemption? Sure.

848
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:10,991
But, in the end he's just
another dead rat...

849
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:14,161
...in a garbage pail behind
a Chinese restaurant.

850
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:30,594
He might been...

851
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:32,513
Yes, he did.

852
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:35,432
My suicide mission's been canceled.

853
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:38,477
We're replacing it with a
go-for-broke rescue mission.

854
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:42,815
In a way, I'm almost glad
that flood interrupted us,

855
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,733
...because I don't like
the toast I was giving.

856
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:46,401
I'm gonna start over.

857
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:53,826
When I look down this table
with the exquisite feast set before us,

858
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:57,412
I see, two terrific lawyers,
a skilled pediatrician,

859
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:59,581
...a wonderful chef,
a savvy real estate agent,

860
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:02,709
...an excellent tailor, a crack
accountant, a gifted musician,

861
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:04,586
...a pretty good minnow fisherman,
and possibly...

862
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:07,631
...the best landscape painter
working on the scene today.

863
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:10,634
Maybe a few of you might even read
my column from time to time.

864
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:12,678
Who knows?
I tend to doubt it.

865
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:16,974
I also see a room full of wild animals.

866
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:21,186
Wild animals with true natures
and pure talents.

867
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:23,647
Wild animals with
scientific sounding Latin names...

868
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,440
...that means something
about our D.N.A.

869
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:30,821
Wild animals each with his own strengths
and weaknesses due to his or her species.

870
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:35,617
Anyway, I think it may very well be
all the beautiful differences among us

871
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:39,204
that just might give us the tiniest glimmer
of a chance of saving my nephew

872
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:43,542
and letting me make it up to you for getting
us into this crazy whatever-it-is.

873
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,795
I don't know. It's just a thought.
Thank you for listening.

874
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:48,589
Cheers, everyone.

875
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:53,135
Let's eat!

876
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:58,307
What? I was just playing
along with the pitch he was doing.

877
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:00,809
Will you join me?

878
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,854
I will.

879
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:07,566
Go ahead.

880
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:09,026
Thank you.

881
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:11,695
Alright! Let's start planning!
Who knows shorthand?

882
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:14,573
Great! Linda! <i>Lutra Lutra!</i>
You got some dry paper?

883
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:15,407
Here we go.

884
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:17,367
Mole! <i>Talpa Europea!</i>
What do you got?

885
01:00:17,493 --> 01:00:19,620
- I can see in the dark?
- That's incredible! We can use that!

886
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:20,954
- Linda?
- Got it.

887
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:22,998
- Rabbit! <i>Oryctolagus Cuniculus!</i>
- I'm fast.

888
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,875
- You bet you're! Linda?
- Got it.

889
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:26,752
- Beaver! <i>Castor Fiber!</i>
- I can chew through wood.

890
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,212
- Amazing! Linda?
- Got it.

891
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:30,672
- Badger! <i>Meles Meles!</i>
- Demolitions expert!

892
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:31,715
What? Since when?

893
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:34,551
- Explosions, flames, burning things!
- Demolitions expert!

894
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:36,053
- Okay! Linda?
- Got it.

895
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:39,223
- Weasel! <i>Mustela Nivalis!</i>
- Stop yelling!

896
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:40,641
Alright!

897
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:43,393
Alright, Ash, you get these
little kids organized

898
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,563
...and put together some kind of a K.P. unit
or something to keep this sewer clean.

899
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:47,731
It's good for morale.

900
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,483
Done! What's K.P?

901
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:51,860
I think it means janitors.

902
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,448
Hey! Hey!
Mate, over here! Hey!

903
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:59,201
I wanna go with you, too.
I wanna fight.

904
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:02,704
Good. Fabulous!
<i>Microtus Pennsylvanicus!</i>

905
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:09,419
I didn't get a job yet or a Latin name.
What's my strength?

906
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:12,548
Listen, you're Kylie.
You're an unbelievably nice guy.

907
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:15,592
Your job is really just to...
be available, I think.

908
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:16,885
I don't know your Latin name.

909
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,555
I doubt they even had opossums
in ancient Rome.

910
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,940
It's stupendous.
Where's us?

911
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,859
- Right here.
- Paint an X.

912
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:36,196
<i>Dear Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean,</i>

913
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,699
<i>I have no alternative
but to agree to your terms.</i>

914
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:39,658
<i>Move the station wagon...</i>

915
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,994
<i>...and open the manhole cover
below the foot of the drainpipe...</i>

916
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:45,038
<i>...next to the cobbler's shop and
meet me there today at 10 a. m. sharp.</i>

917
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:48,500
<i>I will hand myself over to you
in exchange for the boy's safe return.</i>

918
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,377
<i>Cordially, Mr. Fox.</i>

919
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:53,922
Why'd he write this in letters
cut out of magazines?

920
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:56,008
I don't know,
but you did the same thing.

921
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:59,386
I don't trust this guy.
Anyway, set up the ambush.

922
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:03,640
Synchronize your clocks.
The time is now nine forty-five a. m.

923
01:02:04,475 --> 01:02:06,310
Here, put these bandit hats on.

924
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:03,534
Did you bring the boy?

925
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:07,162
Of course, we did!
Say something, kid!

926
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,833
<i>Excuse me! Excuse me?</i>

927
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,252
Come on! That doesn't sound
anything like him!

928
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:15,045
It's amateur night in Dixie!

929
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:25,848
What the cuss is he burning?

930
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:30,018
<i>Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

931
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:33,605
<i>One fat, one short, one lean.</i>

932
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,780
Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox?

933
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:44,908
<i>Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

934
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:46,827
<i>One fat, one short, one lean.</i>

935
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,871
<i>These horrible crooks,
so different in looks,</i>

936
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:50,956
<i>...were nonetheless equally mean.</i>

937
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,667
It's unclear, whether the...

938
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,545
<i>These horrible crooks,
so different in looks,</i>

939
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:58,213
<i>...were nonetheless equally mean.</i>

940
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,048
<i>Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

941
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:01,967
<i>One fat, one short, one lean.</i>

942
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,052
<i>These horrible crooks,
so different in looks,</i>

943
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:06,138
<i>...were nonetheless equally mean.</i>

944
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:07,806
<i>Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

945
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,766
<i>One fat, one short, one lean.</i>

946
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:14,229
Twenty-eight pinecones fired!
Twenty-two targets hit.

947
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:20,319
...phase! Go!
- Yes, sir.

948
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:37,294
Da... Dad's on fire.

949
01:04:40,172 --> 01:04:43,300
- Foxy, you're on.
- We are ready.

950
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:46,386
I'm gonna find him,
I'm gonna bring him back.

951
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:48,013
I know, you will.

952
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:49,890
Contact!

953
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:06,323
Are you scared of wolves?

954
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:08,450
Scared, no!
I have a phobia of them!

955
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:10,410
Well, I have a thing about thunder!

956
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:13,580
- Why? That's stupid!
- I don't like needles myself!

957
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:16,041
Where did you come from again?
How did you get in the sidecar?

958
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,168
I feel like I'm losing my mind!

959
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:24,132
I've got a fox on a motorcycle
with a littler fox and, uh...

960
01:05:24,258 --> 01:05:28,762
...what looks like to be an opossum
in the sidecar riding north on farm lane 7.

961
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:30,889
Does that sound like
anything to anybody?

962
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,516
<i>Red, it's Franklin Bean!</i>

963
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:34,017
<i>Turn around,
get the cuss back here,</i>

964
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,353
<i>...and pick us up on the A.S.A.P!</i>

965
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:09,928
Kylie, you got a credit card?
- Sure.

966
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:11,430
See, this is what
I was saying about...

967
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:13,307
...how good you are
at just being available for...

968
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:14,766
A Titanium Card?

969
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:16,977
How the cuss did you qualify for this?

970
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:20,147
I pay my bills on time.
I've always had good credit.

971
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:30,032
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

972
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:32,826
What's this thing you do?
The whistle with the clicking sound.

973
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:36,121
What do you mean?
That's my trademark.

974
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:08,987
Give me a blueberry.

975
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:11,281
- What?
- Blueberry.

976
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:13,450
- You didn't say...
- You forgot the blueberries?

977
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,119
I did say it!
I wrote it on your paw!

978
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:18,247
Yeah, it's written...

979
01:07:22,084 --> 01:07:23,919
What's that white stuff
around his mouth?

980
01:07:24,086 --> 01:07:25,796
I think he eats soap.

981
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:31,844
That's not soap.

982
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:35,347
- Well, then why does he have that bubbly...
- He's rabid. With rabies.

983
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:37,558
I've heard about this beagle.

984
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,396
You two go ahead
while I distract him.

985
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:51,655
Who? Huh! What!?

986
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:04,668
I can fit through there.
- Hm?

987
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:06,587
You wanna know why?

988
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:07,963
Why?

989
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:10,299
Because I'm little.

990
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,259
Give me that shoelace.

991
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:24,646
It's me.
I'm rescuing you.

992
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:29,985
- I've got mixed feelings about that.
- I don't blame you.

993
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:36,158
Can you give me a karate lesson
real quick?

994
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:39,912
Okay. Stand like this.

995
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:43,415
Position yourself on the balls of your feet.
Close your eyes.

996
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,834
You weigh less than a slice of bread.

997
01:08:47,836 --> 01:08:50,797
I feel like there's a tenderness
in your eyes, isn't there?

998
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:52,674
Yes, I'm right.

999
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:54,843
Let's review the principle of
... techniques:

1000
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:57,304
...jumping, flipping, landing.

1001
01:08:57,596 --> 01:09:00,307
You're a good boy.
A little lonely, maybe, but...

1002
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,226
...terribly sweet.

1003
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:05,646
Is your name Spitz?
That's German, isn't it?

1004
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:08,857
Now for a rudimentary version
of the cyclone chop.

1005
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:11,735
First, you need to get a running start,
which obviously, I can't do in here,

1006
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,612
...then, as you arrive at the
destination of the chop...

1007
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:15,489
...lean and thrust
into the point of contact,

1008
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:17,699
...paw remains open and straight,
then withdraw instantaneously.

1009
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:19,493
Remember, it's the pull back
that matters.

1010
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:22,663
The pull back generates
the force of the impact.

1011
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:23,997
Got it.

1012
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:28,460
Yeah, I'm just gonna chop
this thing right off.

1013
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,680
He's gonna do it!

1014
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:45,144
Why, you're just as sweet as...

1015
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:49,857
I thought he said: never look
a beagle in the eye.

1016
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:01,952
Did... Did you chop it?

1017
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:04,163
Oh, no! No! No!

1018
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:20,554
Kristofferson?
Kristofferson!

1019
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,473
I'm okay.

1020
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,808
I'm okay.

1021
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:27,895
- I'm sorry.
- That's alright.

1022
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:30,522
You were just trying to
unlock the apple crate.

1023
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:33,609
No, I mean, Im sorry about...

1024
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:35,402
Oh, you mean from before.

1025
01:10:35,486 --> 01:10:38,113
The apology you owed me
which you never actually said.

1026
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,574
Right. I'm grumpy.

1027
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:42,910
I spit. I wake up
on the wrong side of the bed.

1028
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,369
I'm just...

1029
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:46,663
...different, apparently.

1030
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:49,416
But... it won't happen again.

1031
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,544
Kristofferson, I'm sorry.

1032
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:56,173
That's alright, too.

1033
01:10:57,299 --> 01:10:59,301
Throw me the shoelace, please.

1034
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,688
Are you okay?

1035
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:45,889
He's wearing it.

1036
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:54,481
Your tractors uprooted my tree.
Your posse hunted my family.

1037
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:59,486
Your gunmen kidnapped my nephew.
Your rat insulted my wife...

1038
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:02,281
...and you shot off my tail.

1039
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:05,826
I'm not leaving here
without that neck tie.

1040
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:08,036
Kill him!

1041
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:18,463
Actually, we should just go.

1042
01:12:18,589 --> 01:12:19,756
Where did I park?

1043
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,134
I weigh less than a slice of bread.

1044
01:12:22,217 --> 01:12:23,969
- What?
- I'll be right back.

1045
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:25,053
Ash!?

1046
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,606
Dodge the grabbers,
duck the taggers,

1047
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:37,232
...jump the twig basket and...

1048
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,693
...knock the cedar-stick
off the cross-rock.

1049
01:12:58,128 --> 01:12:59,421
Hot box!

1050
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:00,839
<i>Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

1051

Ash, that was pure,
wild animal craziness.

1063
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:33,747
You're an athlete.

1064
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:36,625
Here, put this bandit hat on.

1065
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:41,296
Goggles!

1066
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:43,423
<i>Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

1067
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:45,092
<i>One fat, one short, one lean.</i>

1068
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:47,010
<i>These horrible crooks,
so different in looks,</i>

1069
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:48,512
<i>...were nonetheless equally mean.</i>

1070
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,013
<i>Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.</i>

1071
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:51,265
<i>One fat, one short, one lean.</i>

1072
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:53,016
Are you gonna...?

1073
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:59,690
Holy swearing cuss!

1074
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:11,994
Petey! Bring us a ladder, please.

1075
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:13,912
Stand by!

1076
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,915
I just intercepted a high frequency
radio signal with the can.

1077
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:19,001
And I think they're on their way home!

1078
01:14:27,759 --> 01:14:30,888
Don't turn around.
- What?

1079
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,356
Where did he come from?

1080
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:44,526
Where did you come from?

1081
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:47,529
What are you doing here?

1082
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:50,991
<i>Canis lupus!</i>

1083
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:53,494
<i>Vulpes Vulpes!</i>

1084
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:57,372
I don't think he speaks
English or Latin.

1085
01:14:58,499 --> 01:15:01,126
<i>Pensez-vous que I'hiver sera rude?</i>

1086
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:04,463
I'm asking if he thinks
we're in for a hard winter.

1087
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:10,177
He doesn't seem to know.

1088
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:15,015
I have a phobia of wolves!

1089
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:32,741
What a beautiful creature.

1090
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:34,576
Wish him luck, boys.

1091
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,287
- Good luck.
- Good luck out there.

1092
01:15:59,143 --> 01:16:02,104
These three, in this reporter's opinion,
obsessed farmers...

1093
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:05,858
...remain convinced the fox in question
will eventually reappear.

1094
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:06,942
Why?

1095
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:08,694
Because foxes aren't meant
to live in a sewer.

1096
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:11,405
- They're refugees.
- All they have to eat down there is...

1097
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:12,614
Trash!

1098
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:14,825
And not much of it.

1099
01:16:15,993 --> 01:16:17,161
Thank you, farmers.

1100
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:20,455
For Action Twelve,
this is Dan Peabody.

1101
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:24,960
What are we looking at?
- It's just his tonsils. They're little swelled.

1102
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:27,629
- Oh, is it serious?
- No, hopefully, he wants to lose them.

1103
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:29,506
- Lose the tonsils?
- Let's...

1104
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:34,219
- I'm hungry.
- Well, have some water. Here.

1105
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,388
I like walking.

1106
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:54,490
My darlings?

1107
01:16:55,866 --> 01:16:57,284
- Where are we going?
- Nobody knows.

1108
01:16:57,367 --> 01:16:59,036
We were in the middle
of a meditation practice.

1109
01:16:59,077 --> 01:17:00,245
Watch your step.

1110
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:02,122
Let's see, now.
Where does this lead?

1111
01:17:02,206 --> 01:17:05,876
- Oh, no, Foxy. It's filthy.
- Keep a good grip, everyone.

1112
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,795
- This better be worth it.
- I think I see...

1113
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:11,423
...a little sliver of light.
What's this?

1114
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:14,343
- Is it a door?
- You're a terrible actor, Foxy.

1115
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:17,513
Do you smell something?
Is that... freon?

1116
01:17:17,846 --> 01:17:19,431
I'm gonna crack open
this trap door...

1117
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:21,058
...and see if something's
on the other side.

1118
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:24,686
I highly doubt it, though.
There's probably just more sewer.

1119
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:27,356
- You know, wouldn't it be surprising if
- Open it.

1120
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:36,406
Hey, look! There's a whole,
enormous, glorious,

1121
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:38,450
...gigantic supermarket up here!

1122
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:41,370
And they close early on weekends.

1123
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:49,711
You really are kind of
a quote-unquote fantastic fox.

1124
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:50,963
I try.

1125
01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:52,923
Get enough to share with everybody,
and remember...

1126
01:17:52,965 --> 01:17:56,510
...the Rabbits are vegetarians, and
Badger's supposedly can't eat walnuts.

1127
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,849
I guess now that Kristofferson's dad's
already down to single pneumonia...

1128
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:04,017
...and getting better, he'll be
going home soon, huh?

1129
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:06,228
Actually, when he spoke to me
from the hospital, he said...

1130
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,897
...he was already talking to Weasel
about real estate availabilities

1131
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:10,232
...down in our sewer system.

1132
01:18:10,274 --> 01:18:12,568
Oh, really?
Well, now's the time to buy.

1133
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:23,537
Okay, I get it.
Is that your trademark?

1134
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:28,500
I'm pregnant again.

1135
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:30,335
Wow!

1136
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:34,298
I think we're both glowing.

1137
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:39,386
Do another toast, Dad.

1138
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:43,724
Okay. Let's see.

1139
01:18:44,475 --> 01:18:46,310
Yeah. Right.
Okay!

1140
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:54,026
They say all foxes are
slightly allergic to linoleum.

1141
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:55,360
But it's cool to the paw.

1142
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:56,820
Try it.

1143
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:02,784
They say my tail needs to be
dry cleaned twice a month...

1144
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:05,579
...but now its fully detachable.
See?

1145
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:09,541
They say our tree
may never grow back.

1146
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,710
But, one day, something will.

1147
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:15,297
Yes, these crackles are made out of
synthetic goose,

1148
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:17,758
...and these Giblets come
from artificial squab.

1149
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:19,802
And even these apples look fake...

1150
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:22,179
...but at least they've got
stars on them.

1151
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,015
I guess my point is...

1152
01:19:25,182 --> 01:19:27,309
we'll eat tonight,
and we'll eat together,

1153
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:30,771
...and even in this
not particularly flattering light,

1154
01:19:31,688 --> 01:19:34,650
...you are without a doubt,
the five-and-a-half...

1155
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:37,653
...most wonderful wild animals
I've ever met...

1156
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:39,321
...in my life.

1157
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:42,699
So let's raise our boxes.

1158
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,537
To our...

1159
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:48,622
...survival!

1160
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:56,213
How was that?

1161
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,132
That was a good toast.

1162
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:18,527
<i> Well there she goes
with a brand new love affair </i>

1163
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,572
<i> Dancing with him like
she don't even care </i>

1164
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:26,994
<i> Well let her dance with him,
let her dance all night long </i>

1165
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:35,586
<i> Well who would've known
that just yesterday </i>

1166
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:38,630
<i> She danced with me the very same way </i>

1167
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:44,428
<i> Well let her dance with him,
let her dance all night long </i>

1168
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:03,405
