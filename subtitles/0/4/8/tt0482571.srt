1
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,888
<i>Are you watching closely?</i>

2
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:10,192
<i>Every magic trick consists
of three parts, or acts.</i>

3
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,671
<i>The first part is called "the pledge."</i>

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,107
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary.</i>

5
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,635
<i>A deck of cards, a bird or a man.</i>

6
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,688
<i>He shows you this object.</i>

7
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,350
<i>Perhaps he asks you to inspect it,</i>

8
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,451
<i>to see that it is indeed real,</i>

9
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,588
<i>unaltered, normal.</i>

10
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,136
<i>But, of course, it probably isn't.</i>

11
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,002
Where do you think you're going?

12
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,439
I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

13
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,823
<i>The second act is called "the turn."</i>

14
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,331
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something</i>

15
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:27,003
<i>and makes it do
something extraordinary.</i>

16
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,614
<i>Now you're looking for the
secret, but you won't find it,</i>

17
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:39,522
<i>because, of course,
you're not really looking.</i>

18
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,219
<i>You don't really want to know.</i>

19
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,855
<i>You want to be... fooled.</i>

20
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,969
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet,</i>

21
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:55,201
<i>because making something
disappear isn't enough.</i>

22
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,870
<i>You have to bring it back.</i>

23
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,146
<i>That's why every magic trick
has a third act.</i>

24
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,878
<i>The hardest part.</i>

25
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,477
<i>The part we call...</i>

26
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,886
<i>..."the prestige."</i>

27
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,865
The prestige? And did Robert
Angier, the Great Danton, your employer,

28
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,372
get to that final part
of his trick that night?

29
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,533
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

30
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,202
I saw someone making
their way below stage.

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,180
I followed him.

32
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,514
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

33
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:43,022
Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter.

34
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,455
<i>I'm an ingnieur, I design illusions</i>

35
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,688
and construct the apparatus
necessary for performing them.

36
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:53,198
So, Mr. Cutter, was this
water-filled tank beneath the stage

37
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,858
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

38
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,802
No. The tank was brought
on for the first trick

39
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,839
and then taken offstage.

40
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,206
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the end of it.

41
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,835
How large was this tank?

42
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,506
It's a normal tank
for escape under water,

43
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,708
about 400 or 500 gallons.

44
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,274
How do you think he
was able to move the tank

45
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,719
under the trap door
without anyone noticing?

46
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,154
He's a magician, ask him.

47
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,316
I ask again,

48
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,623
would this man explain the mechanics
of Mr. Angier's illusion.

49
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,028
The Real Transported Man is one
of the most sought after illusions

50
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,293
in this business.

51
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,925
I have the right to sell it on.

52
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,630
If I reveal the method here,
the trick is worthless.

53
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,968
How can we know
that the tank wasn't simply

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,508
some part of the trick that went wrong?

55
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,635
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament.

56
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,111
But Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

57
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,343
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private,

58
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,250
I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

59
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,948
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

60
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,608
I'm going to have to ask
you to turn out your pockets.

61
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:19,309
Not my idea, sir. The warden saw
his show in Manchester last year

62
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,250
where he vanished into thin air.

63
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,812
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

64
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,024
I told him the only way
Borden's going to disappear

65
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,530
is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

66
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,735
Check the locks...

67
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,999
...twice.

68
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,608
My name is Owens.

69
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,949
I'm a solicitor.

70
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,684
I represent Lord Caldlow, an
accomplished amateur magician and...

71
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,352
How much?

72
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,759
- He is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

73
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,422
Five thousand pounds.

74
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,989
<i>Talk to Fallon, my ingnieur.
Money's for him.</i>

75
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,764
Yes, I did. He offered
to sell me your tricks.

76
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,705
All except the most valuable
one, The Transported Man.

77
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,073
Well, I won't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

78
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,577
Even for your daughter?

79
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:25,581
If you are for the drop, your daughter
is going to need looking after.

80
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,380
Fallon will take care of her.

81
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,182
Perfect, Fallon.

82
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,280
A man with a past
as obscure as your own.

83
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:36,385
The courts have motioned she be removed
from his care. She will be an orphan.

84
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,726
I know you're no stranger
to the workhouse.

85
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,330
It's better than here?

86
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,632
I'm offering you a way to wrap up
your affairs with dignity.

87
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,672
I'm offering your daughter a future.

88
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,765
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing...

89
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,673
...ever.

90
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,736
Well, think it over.

91
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,580
And Lord Caldlow
would like you to have this,

92
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,176
as a show of good faith.
It might be of interest.

93
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,781
Robert Angier's diary, including
the time he spent in Colorado

94
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,119
learning your trick.

95
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,887
- He never learned it.
- Really?

96
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,487
On his return, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man

97
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:15,523
that the papers said was
better even than your original.

98
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,796
If you want Angier's secrets,

99
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,432
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

100
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,373
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

101
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,746
Consider your daughter.

102
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,157
<i>A cipher,</i>

103
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,249
<i>an enigma...</i>

104
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,992
<i>...a search,</i>

105
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,052
<i>a search for answers.</i>

106
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,538
<i>Even if Colorado
is the end of my journey,</i>

107
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,806
<i>it'll take much longer to unravel</i>

108
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,779
<i>the rest of Borden's secrets.</i>

109
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,816
<i>See, the cipher in his notebook is</i>

110
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,376
<i>unlocked by a single word,</i>

111
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,423
<i>but it will still take months
to translate his writing.</i>

112
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,255
<i>And to know his mind.</i>

113
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,528
<i>Well, my passion is equal to the task.</i>

114
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,139
Mr. Angier, welcome
to Colorado Springs.

115
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,591
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,274
Well...

117
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,842
...quite a reception.

118
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,412
You're our first guest
of the season, Mr. Angier.

119
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,982
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'd be staying with us.

120
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,687
As long as it takes.

121
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,027
I will need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

122
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,827
Well, the peak's closed, sir.

123
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,731
For scientific experimentation.

124
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,770
Yes, I know.

125
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,134
That's why I'm here.

126
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,609
Whoa. Whoa.

127
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,252
You'll have to walk
the rest, I'm afraid, sir.

128
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,018
I'm amazed how many
of you newspaper writers

129
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,151
can't read my sign.

130
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,492
Not the welcome I was expecting.

131
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,530
I know you.

132
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,034
You're the Great Danton.

133
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,410
I saw your show in London.

134
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,245
Seven times you guessed every object

135
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,547
the audience had in their pockets.

136
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm Alley. Sorry about the fence.
People keep interfering with our work.

137
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,419
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

138
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,554
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine some time ago.

139
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,122
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

140
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,430
I've brought a lot of money.

141
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,164
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

142
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,799
I simply can't help.

143
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,104
I'll be staying
at the hotel, indefinitely.

144
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,542
Hey, what am I holding?

145
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,915
Your watch.

146
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,216
<i>Borden's journal
entry for April 3, 1897,</i>

147
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,387
<i>describes a show
at the Orpheum Theater.</i>

148
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,364
<i>That was just days
after he first met me.</i>

149
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,469
<i>We were two young men
at the start of a great career,</i>

150
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,871
<i>two young men devoted to an illusion,</i>

151
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,501
<i>two young men who never
intended to hurt anyone.</i>

152
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,340
Which of you brave souls

153
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,142
is willing to bind
this lovely young woman?

154
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,851
Me!

155
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,851
If you would tie her wrists,

156
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,829
bind her feet...

157
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,423
...around the ankle.

158
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,594
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

159
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,501
- No.
- No.

160
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,400
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

161
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,100
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

162
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,736
Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means,

163
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,043
so now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

164
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,175
He's squandering the goodwill
of his audience with tired,

165
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,845
- second-rate tricks...
- They're all favorites.

166
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,413
Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

167
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,322
A bullet catch is suicide.

168
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,386
All it takes is some smartass
volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

169
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,727
- Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

170
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,767
No seats left for the punters.

171
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,635
All right, no bullet catch, whatever,
but the point is a real magician

172
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,332
tries to invent something new

173
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,274
that other magicians will
scratch their heads over.

174
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,538
Then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

175
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,706
- What?
- I suppose you have such a trick?

176
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,342
- I sure do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

177
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,010
No. No one else can do my trick.

178
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,213
- Any trick can be duplicated.
- Wrong.

179
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:20,019
If Mr. Borden has invented
his masterpiece,

180
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,992
he's prepared to do it.

181
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,188
Milton is a showman,
but Borden is right,

182
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,890
he won't get his hands dirty.

183
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,526
If you want to see what
it takes to make real magic,

184
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,436
go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman
there and he really has what it takes.

185
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,735
- Chung Ling Soo.
- I can't afford that.

186
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,537
I know the bloke run the door.

187
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,944
You two go and see that show, and
whichever one of you can tell me

188
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,108
how he does the goldfish bowl
trick gets the prize.

189
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,448
- Which is?
- Ten minutes onstage

190
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,350
with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.

191
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,854
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

192
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,983
The top theatrical agent in London.

193
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,051
- I saw you drop the knot again.
- I turned my wrists.

194
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,757
Some nights you
just don't get it, do you?

195
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,699
I mean, if that knot slips
and Julia's on the hoist,

196
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:03,860
she'll break her leg.

197
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,563
It's the wrong knot.

198
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,505
Like I said, the Langford
double will hold tighter.

199
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,101
The Langford double isn't
a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

200
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,407
If the rope swells, she can't slip it.

201
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,711
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- We can practice.

202
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:21,719
- Borden, he said no.
- Oh, you know knots better than me?

203
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,778
Listen, no more mistakes.

204
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,552
All right. Yeah? Do you?
You want to take over?

205
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,560
- Just leave.
- I didn't think so.

206
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,830
Hey, Cutter, where's he from?

207
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,200
Where are you from? He shifts
props for Virgil at the hall.

208
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,434
- Worried he'll steal your tricks?
- Doesn't deal in methods.

209
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,568
- How do you know?
- Because I hired him

210
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,875
to find out how Virgil
does the orange trick.

211
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,280
- I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

212
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,443
'Course you can't trust him.

213
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,884
I think he's all right.

214
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,286
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

215
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:01,190
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kiss your wife's leg every night,

216
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,922
so can the blokes at the ends
of rows three and four!

217
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,429
You're wrong. It can't be.

218
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,228
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

219
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,326
This is the performance. Right here.

220
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,769
This is why no one
can detect his method.

221
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,132
Total devotion to his art.

222
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,872
A lot of self-sacrifice.

223
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,311
You know.

224
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,077
It's the only way to escape...

225
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,584
...all this, you know?

226
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,053
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

227
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,027
Or fish, look.

228
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,361
I don't know. Hang on a second.

229
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,997
He must be strong as an ox.

230
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,473
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

231
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,138
Any time he's in public,
any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.

232
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,148
Borden saw it at once.
But I couldn't fathom it.

233
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,083
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

234
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,882
You are pretending.

235
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,979
I don't think changing a name compares.

236
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,525
Not your name. Who you are
and where you're from.

237
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,551
I promised I wouldn't embarrass
my family with my theatrical endeavors.

238
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,329
I thought of a name for you.

239
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,193
The Great Danton.

240
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,241
Do you like it? But it's sophisticated.

241
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,741
It's French.

242
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,879
<i>Borden writes as if no one but
he understood the true nature of magic.</i>

243
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,255
<i>But what does he know of self-sacrifice?</i>

244
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,493
You bloody fool.

245
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,658
- He killed it.
- It's OK.

246
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,567
- He killed it.
- He didn't.

247
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,336
Look, now he'll bring it back.

248
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,513
- No, he killed it.
- No, he didn't.

249
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,792
Look, see, he's all right. He's fine.

250
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,955
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

251
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,931
He's a sharp lad, your son.

252
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,597
Oh, he's my nephew.

253
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,162
Ah.

254
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,901
You're the lucky one today.

255
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,663
Are you watching closely?

256
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,929
Look closer.

257
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,807
Never show anyone.

258
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,609
They'll beg you
and flatter you for the secret,

259
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,174
but as soon as you give it up,
you'll be nothing to them.

260
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,516
You understand? Nothing.

261
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,648
The secret impresses no one.

262
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,319
The trick you use it for is everything.

263
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,500
Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.

264
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,058
You're welcome.

265
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,165
Alfred, it's Alfred.

266
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,832
Alfred.

267
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,877
So I could use a cup of tea.

268
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,471
I can't allow...
It's the landlord. It's not...

269
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,147
You think that's...
Is that enough to keep me out?

270
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,450
I think so.

271
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,049
So I'll see you again?

272
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,759
Milk and sugar?

273
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,826
What's in there?

274
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,827
Angier's machine.

275
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,031
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

276
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,972
Oh, no, sir. This wasn't
built by a magician.

277
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,067
This was built by a wizard.

278
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:57,138
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

279
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:01,413
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

280
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,454
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

281
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,286
An avid collector,
very interested in the case.

282
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,849
Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.

283
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,725
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

284
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,958
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles

285
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,330
it's got a simple
and disappointing trick.

286
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,835
The most disappointing of all, sir.

287
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,701
It has no trick.

288
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,735
It's real.

289
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,146
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

290
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,276
Yes.

291
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,514
This is the...

292
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,648
...place where the performer's
hand reaches through

293
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,987
to the trick padlock.

294
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,323
A standard magical
apparatus for escapes?

295
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,886
Yeah, with one important difference.

296
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,989
This isn't a trick lock.

297
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,034
It's been switched for a real one.

298
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,070
What a way to kill someone.

299
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,833
They're magicians, Your Honor.

300
00:22:54,906 --> 00:23:00,310
Showmen, men who live by dressing up
plain and sometimes brutal truths,

301
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,476
to amaze, to shock.

302
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,709
Even without an audience?

303
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,853
There was an audience.

304
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,747
You see, this water tank

305
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,259
was of particular significance
to these two men.

306
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,086
Particularly awful significance.

307
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,994
Which of you brave souls is
willing to bind this lovely young woman?

308
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,064
If you would tie her wrists,

309
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,304
bind her feet around the ankle.

310
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,119
- Are either of you gentlemen sailors?
- No.

311
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,291
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

312
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,681
Robert!

313
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,242
No, no.

314
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,740
Julia. Julia!

315
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,296
I knew an old sailor once.

316
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,266
They told me he went overboard,

317
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,428
tangled in the sails.

318
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,301
They pulled him out,

319
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:18,274
but it took him five minutes to cough.

320
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,368
He said it was like...

321
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,276
...going home.

322
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,951
What do you want, Borden?

323
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,786
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

324
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,660
Which knot did you tie?

325
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,741
I keep asking myself that.

326
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,800
- And?
- And...

327
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,413
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

328
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,974
You don't know?

329
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,755
I'm sorry.

330
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,318
You don't know?

331
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,125
You don't know?!

332
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,738
- Alfred?
- Good news. We got our first booking.

333
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,143
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

334
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,237
<i>- Mr. Fallon is my ingnieur.
- Where did you get all...?</i>

335
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,307
- I had to borrow and... don't ask.
- He's a very enterprising soul

336
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,182
is... is Mr. Fallon. So...

337
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,689
- We can't afford to pay him.
- The money will come with the audience.

338
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:42,454
But what about until then?
What I earn, it's barely enough for us.

339
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:46,486
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

340
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,533
You're going to be
doing that with someone else.

341
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,501
No. You're...

342
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,833
Having a baby.

343
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,806
Oh, my God.

344
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,708
We should have told Fallon.
That is great.

345
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,246
Oh, come here.

346
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,282
Oh.

347
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,874
Alfred, what is this?

348
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:11,115
Oh, this is just the trick to work
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

349
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,885
Is it the masterpiece, the great trick?

350
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,722
No, no, no, the world is
not ready for that one yet.

351
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:21,129
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

352
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,724
- A bullet catch.
- Yeah, but it's safe.

353
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,100
I promise. Look.

354
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,737
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

355
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,037
Go on, shoot me.

356
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,571
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

357
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,208
No, no, not there.
Shoot me here. Don't...

358
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,322
How's that?

359
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,724
That's very good. Tell me how you do it.

360
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,920
No, I can't do that.

361
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,864
- Well, then you can't do it.
- I can't do it?

362
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,267
I'm sorry, but I can't
raise a child on my own.

363
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,669
You don't tell anybody that I told you.

364
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,072
- OK.
- Gunpowder.

365
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,770
Wadding.

366
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,507
Then the bullet.

367
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,846
Ramrod.

368
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,547
Hold out your hand.

369
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:26,563
The bullet is not even in the
gun when the charge is fired.

370
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:30,397
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

371
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,460
Well, I mean, you still get...

372
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,130
It's dangerous.

373
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,401
- People still get killed doing that.
- How?

374
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,205
You get some smartass who
could put a penny or a button

375
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,611
or, God forbid, Sarah, somebody
could put a bullet down there.

376
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,878
Don't worry. Don't worry,

377
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,216
because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

378
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,155
Everything's gonna
be all right because...

379
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,791
...I love you very much.

380
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,730
- Say it again.
- I love you.

381
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,271
- Not today.
- What?

382
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,501
Well, some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

383
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,806
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

384
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,506
I like being able
to tell the difference.

385
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,379
It makes the days it is true

386
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,782
mean something.

387
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,854
All right.

388
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,141
Metal rings,
ladies and gentlemen.

389
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,874
If there are any
ladies and gentlemen here.

390
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,315
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

391
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,054
Who threw that?

392
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,443
This is what you came for, is it?

393
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,775
So...

394
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,788
...who wants to volunteer?

395
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,619
- I do!
- Me!

396
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,424
Me.

397
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,261
Me.

398
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,175
Are you man enough, sir?

399
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,989
Yes.

400
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,830
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

401
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,310
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

402
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,177
I don't know.

403
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:52,396
<i>He came in to demand
an answer, and I told him the truth.</i>

404
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,633
<i>That I have fought with myself
over that night,</i>

405
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:59,040
<i>one half of me swearing blind
that I tied a simple slipknot,</i>

406
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,477
<i>the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double.</i>

407
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,572
<i>I can never know for sure.</i>

408
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,782
How can he not know!

409
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,617
<i>How can he not know?</i>

410
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,748
<i>He must know what he did.</i>

411
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,226
<i>He must.</i>

412
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,855
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

413
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,195
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

414
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,703
It's as bad as the day it happened.

415
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,376
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the doctor back.

416
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,541
- You've woken her.
- Great.

417
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,517
I'm sorry, I need this to heal
so I can get back to work.

418
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:45,352
You've got to face things. What tricks
can you perform with this injury?

419
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,881
I can do car pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

420
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,329
I can still do that. I can do
the trick I've been telling you about.

421
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,525
The one that they're
gonna remember me for.

422
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,494
Come on.

423
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,260
I never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a pint glass.

424
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,924
Hasn't stopped your looking.

425
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,006
Heard about a booking.
Nice little theater.

426
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,909
- Young, up-and-coming magician.
- Who?

427
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,708
- You.
- Me? Booking? Why?

428
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,874
I want to keep on working.

429
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,181
<i>Who's going to hire the ingnieur
that killed Julia McCullough</i>

430
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,380
in front of a sellout crowd
at the Orpheum?

431
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,351
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

432
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,917
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

433
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:01,522
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

434
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,397
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

435
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,575
We'll have to whitewash the windows,

436
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,339
confound the more curious
members of the public, but it will do.

437
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,810
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

438
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,482
You settled on a name?

439
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,049
Yes, I have.

440
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,989
The Great Danton.

441
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,584
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

442
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,226
No, it's sophisticated.

443
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,062
The birdcage can't be
our climax. Everybody knows it.

444
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,535
- Not like this.
- I don't want to kill doves.

445
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,469
Then stay off the stage.

446
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,234
You're a magician, not a wizard.

447
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,175
You got to get your hands dirty, if
you're going to achieve the impossible.

448
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,012
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

449
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,542
No point in meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit. On the right.

450
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,748
- What's so hard about this?
- Nothing.

451
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,350
You're going... down here.

452
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,034
- And this will conceal, right?
- Oh, sure.

453
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,295
- Tighten up on there.
- Yep.

454
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,396
OK.

455
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,566
This ties up here?

456
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,042
- Ties in the back.
- Good.

457
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,312
Breathe as little as possible.

458
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,453
Now, you see?

459
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,927
- That's it.
- OK.

460
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,197
She's not experienced,

461
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,293
but she knows how to present herself.

462
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,966
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

463
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,409
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick,

464
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,242
I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

465
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,579
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

466
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,009
Yep.

467
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,517
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

468
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,389
Come around his foot.

469
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,893
- Careful.
- It's all right.

470
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,013
- Your volunteer, put their hand there.
- Yeah?

471
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,916
And another one here.

472
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,514
If you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

473
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,921
Thank you, Olivia.

474
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,758
You best not be intending
to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.

475
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,195
- Of course not.
- Ready? Right.

476
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,763
- One...
- Two...

477
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,764
Three.

478
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,571
That's bloody marvelous, Cutter.

479
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,771
Very nice.

480
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,642
And the best part is...

481
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,453
I thought you said I had
to get my hands dirty.

482
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,421
Someday, perhaps you will.

483
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,048
I just had to know that you can.

484
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,059
Very nice. Very nice, indeed.

485
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,790
I haven't had the chance to compliment
you on your beautiful theater.

486
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,230
It'll be a lot more
beautiful when it's full.

487
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,289
Don't worry.

488
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,597
You all say that. Why should I worry?

489
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,537
If your tricks don't get them
in, somebody else's will.

490
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:32,702
Maybe somebody willing
to do a bullet catch or a water escape?

491
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,335
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

492
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:38,075
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

493
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,140
What would that do for your business?

494
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:43,084
You got a week, John.

495
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,521
Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

496
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,863
Thank you.

497
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,297
Uh... Sir, in the third row there.

498
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,068
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

499
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,874
This isn't mine.

500
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:11,403
Perhaps you'd return it to the lady
in the aisle of the second row.

501
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,780
I believe she has yours.

502
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:24,788
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making
so many mistakes. I'm so nervous.

503
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,126
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

504
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,428
They've seen a lot of tricks before,

505
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,991
but not this next one.

506
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,808
Cloth over.

507
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,643
Keep your fingers crossed.

508
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,979
I'll have the champagne ready.

509
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,764
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all before.

510
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,962
I'll make it a little
harder then, shall I?

511
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:10,006
Two volunteers, please.
A lady and a gentlemen.

512
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,271
To hold this cage with me.

513
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,312
I'll perform this feat in a manner

514
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:19,907
never before seen by yourselves or any
other audience anywhere in the world.

515
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,014
Madame, place one hand
on the back of the cage,

516
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,613
one hand on the front.

517
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,056
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage

518
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,650
one hand on the top.

519
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:47,043
- I should've spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

520
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,273
- Don't suppose we can do this again.
- No.

521
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,781
- So, what's the climax of our show?
- Show?

522
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,978
- You don't have a show.
- We have a week's engagement.

523
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:58,648
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

524
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:01,419
Clear out, anything here
in the morning gets burned.

525
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,927
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

526
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,793
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

527
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,424
Well, there's
plenty of good theaters.

528
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:14,336
If we can come up with a new trick,

529
00:41:14,406 --> 00:41:17,637
- change the name of the act.
- The name stays.

530
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:24,608
Right, well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible then.

531
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,708
I have a couple of methods to try out.

532
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:30,016
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

533
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,919
And if you need some inspiration,

534
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,153
there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

535
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,956
Engineers, scientists, you know?

536
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,328
That sort of thing captures
the public's imagination.

537
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:01,784
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends
me down here during the storms.

538
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,084
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

539
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,457
Two of them.

540
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,154
Beautiful, isn't it?
God, I miss New York, though.

541
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,663
- Why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

542
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,359
And not much else.

543
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,957
Our work is secret.

544
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:19,502
That a cipher?

545
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,734
A rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

546
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:28,802
Simple but time-consuming to translate,
even with the five-letter keyword.

547
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,609
Which is?

548
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,673
We magicians have a circle of trust.

549
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:36,847
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

550
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,684
Maybe I bought it.

551
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:41,487
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there?

552
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,857
I've already found it.

553
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,327
That's why I'm here.

554
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:54,164
Tesla built one for another magician.

555
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,002
Why would you want the same thing?

556
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,065
Call it a professional rivalry.

557
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:02,273
Mr. Tesla has built unusual
machines for unusual people.

558
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:06,375
- But he would never talk about it.
- I understand discretion.

559
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:07,748
I just want the machine.

560
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,750
Finish your drink.

561
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:16,421
I want to show you something.
I think you'll have

562
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:18,724
a special appreciation for our work.

563
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:22,255
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

564
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,062
Who's gonna believe you?

565
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,431
Not long now.

566
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,973
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

567
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,770
Tesla electrified the whole town

568
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:34,903
in exchange for using the
generators when we need them.

569
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,311
We do our tests when
the townspeople are asleep.

570
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:42,080
Mr. Tesla doesn't want
to scare anyone.

571
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,929
Where are the wires?

572
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,570
Exactly.

573
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:16,481
Where's the generator?

574
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:17,987
You saw it last week.

575
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:21,150
- That must be ten miles from here.
- Fifteen.

576
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:25,322
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

577
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:28,092
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

578
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,262
<i>Magic. Real magic.</i>

579
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,464
Now appearing, only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall,

580
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,806
one of the miracles of our age.

581
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:43,473
A technological marvel. You've never
seen anything like it in your lives.

582
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:46,278
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

583
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:49,218
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

584
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,778
Free, clean power.
Like to know the future?

585
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,916
The man who's speaking right now
is going to change the world.

586
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:59,362
Come one, come all.
Immediate seating, no waiting.

587
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:15,707
Ladies and gentlemen,

588
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,646
objections have been raised...

589
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,153
They should be raised.
Does that look safe to you?

590
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,781
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign

591
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:31,557
against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

592
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:34,462
We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider.

593
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,023
Which he will not!

594
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:42,266
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

595
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,900
This thing's gonna blow.

596
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,678
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

597
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:28,511
Hey.

598
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:33,189
Hello, Jess.

599
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:39,460
Have you had a nice day
with mommy? Huh?

600
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:42,423
Sarah.

601
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,401
- I love you.
- See, today it's true.

602
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,030
- Yeah.
- Hello.

603
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:52,307
<i>I saw happiness.</i>

604
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:55,005
<i>Happiness that should have been mine.</i>

605
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,104
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

606
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,811
<i>His notebook reveals that
he never had the life that I envied.</i>

607
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:04,514
<i>The family life
that he craves one minute,</i>

608
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:08,889
<i>he rails against the next,
demanding freedom.</i>

609
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,952
<i>His mind... his mind is a divided one.</i>

610
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,463
<i>His soul is restless.</i>

611
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,658
<i>His wife and child, tormented</i>

612
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:19,692
<i>by his fickle and contradictory nature.</i>

613
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,399
So, what do you think you'll call her?

614
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,842
I don't know.

615
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:30,210
Everybody needs a name, so, what's hers?

616
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:32,912
Maybe Sarah.

617
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,686
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

618
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:40,986
Well, you talk about what you want
to do for the rest of the day.

619
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:42,924
All right, go on, you talk with her.

620
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:49,629
Are they taking her away?

621
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,601
To the workhouse?

622
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,929
You keep talking.

623
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:01,043
Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it.

624
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,909
Go on, take it.

625
00:48:06,484 --> 00:48:08,611
It's for the best.

626
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:16,018
Let me see.

627
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:18,722
I'm gonna learn
all the professor's secrets.

628
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:22,232
Only if I teach you how to read.

629
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,666
They're just stupid tricks, right?

630
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:27,967
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

631
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:31,372
Or can't you undo real locks, professor?

632
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,406
Maybe I'm just biding my time.

633
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,971
Maybe one day I'll...

634
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,677
...open my hand, get your attention,

635
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:43,653
ask, "Are you watching closely?"

636
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:45,814
Maybe a magic whirl or two.

637
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,257
And then I'll be gone.

638
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:56,925
How'd you get so famous then?

639
00:48:57,835 --> 00:48:59,564
Magic.

640
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,906
Oi! Borden, get back here!

641
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:06,534
Thank you.

642
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,579
Shut up!

643
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:13,976
Where's the bloody key?!

644
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:23,059
<i>February 8, 1899.</i>

645
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,254
<i>Today, finally, a breakthrough.</i>

646
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:28,059
<i>Tesla's agreed to see me.</i>

647
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:36,967
Perfectly safe.

648
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:02,262
So this is the Great Danton.

649
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:06,929
Mr. Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions.

650
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,331
Hold out other hand.

651
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:22,716
- What's conducting the electricity?
- Our bodies, Mr. Angier.

652
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:26,985
Quite capable of conducting
and, indeed, producing energy.

653
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,585
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

654
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,659
I need something impossible.

655
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:42,202
You're familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

656
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:43,968
Is a lie.

657
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,066
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

658
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:50,145
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

659
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:54,881
First time I tried to change the world,

660
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:56,715
I was hailed as a visionary.

661
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,348
Second time...

662
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,449
...I was asked politely to retire.

663
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:07,121
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

664
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:11,066
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.
What you want is simply expensive.

665
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:13,365
If I were to build for you this machine,

666
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,497
you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

667
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,907
Well, if people actually
believed the things I did on stage,

668
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,377
they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.

669
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:24,437
Think of sawing a woman in half.

670
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:26,847
Have you considered the cost of this?

671
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,852
Price is not an object.

672
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,879
Perhaps not, but have you
considered the cost?

673
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,189
I'm not sure I follow.

674
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,091
Go home, forget this thing.

675
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:40,357
I can recognize an obsession.

676
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:44,458
- No good will come of it.
- Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

677
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,766
At first, but I have
followed them too long.

678
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,772
I am their slave.

679
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,934
And one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

680
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:59,182
If you understand an obsession, then
you know you won't change my mind.

681
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,106
So be it.

682
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,951
Will you build it?

683
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:08,483
I've already begun
to build it, Mr. Angier.

684
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,552
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.
This will take some time.

685
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,183
Uh... I thought you'd gone.

686
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,792
I don't really have anywhere to go.

687
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,662
You've been sleeping here?

688
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:51,464
Cutter said it'd be all right till we
get another booking. What are you doing?

689
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,765
Uh... research.

690
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,271
Part of a magician's job

691
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,206
is to... watch his competition,
see what illusions...

692
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,210
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

693
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,143
Cutter's hoping you let things lie.

694
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:06,081
He says if Borden thinks
things are even between you...

695
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,981
Even?

696
00:53:08,052 --> 00:53:10,612
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

697
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,782
He has a family now
and he's performing again.

698
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,691
Borden is out there living
his life just as he intended,

699
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:19,457
as if nothing had happened
and look at me.

700
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,021
I'm alone and no theater will touch me.

701
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:23,691
Us.

702
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,134
You're going to need a better disguise.

703
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,849
I need a volunteer.

704
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:47,390
What happened?

705
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,223
Did you hurt him?

706
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:53,426
What happened, Robert?

707
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:59,792
You, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes?

708
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,962
Thank you.

709
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:03,632
Just a rubber ball? No.

710
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,904
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

711
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,103
It's magic.

712
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,972
He had a new trick.

713
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,553
Was it good?

714
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:34,894
It was the greatest
magic trick I've ever seen.

715
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,936
Did they applaud
when you saw it?

716
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,879
It was too good. It was too simple.
The audience hardly had time to see it.

717
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,816
- He's a dreadful magician.
- A wonderful magician.

718
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:50,410
He's a dreadful showman.
He doesn't dress it up,

719
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,319
- how to sell it.
- How does he do it?

720
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,414
- He uses a double.
- No, it's too simple.

721
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:55,982
This is a complex illusion.

722
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,460
You say that because
you don't know the method.

723
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:00,929
It's a double that comes out.
It's the only way.

724
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:04,900
I've seen him perform it three times.
The prestige is the same man.

725
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:08,496
- No, it's not.
- The same man comes out of the cabinet.

726
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:10,836
It's the same man.

727
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:13,604
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers,

728
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,271
but, if you look closely, you can tell.

729
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,849
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

730
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:23,352
Yeah, we could use it
as a climax to the show.

731
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,820
Yes.

732
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,087
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

733
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,321
We got to find someone
who looks like you.

734
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:34,922
- He doesn't use a double.
- I don't know how Borden does it.

735
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:39,493
Either... You either wait for him
to retire and buy the secret,

736
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,367
or you listen to how I would do it.

737
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,963
And the only way
that I know how to do it

738
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,509
is to find you a bloody good double.

739
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,910
All right.

740
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,838
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

741
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:55,044
Whoo!

742
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,609
Look, look.

743
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,682
What's that?

744
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,328
- It's for you.
- What's this for?

745
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,797
Come.

746
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:15,701
You...

747
00:56:15,773 --> 00:56:19,800
- I asked you last week...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

748
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:22,072
- But you won't ever...
- Sarah,

749
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:25,309
I'm gonna have
to change my mind, aren't I?

750
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:30,046
The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in
a bigger theater, things will work out.

751
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:36,423
I can't believe it. Thank you.
Thank you. It's beautiful.

752
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:46,161
- Gerry?
- Darling, look at you.

753
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:49,206
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

754
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:51,434
Mm-hm.

755
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:58,214
A pleasure. Pleasure
to meet you fine gentlemen.

756
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:02,013
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

757
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:08,149
Yes. Are you laughing now?

758
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,222
I have to take a piss.

759
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:17,726
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course, he's an out-of-work actor.

760
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,701
He's perfect. He needs a little help.

761
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,739
But when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

762
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,400
I don't need him to be my
brother, I need him to be me.

763
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:27,171
Give me a month.

764
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,579
So you open the door...

765
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:38,121
...and...

766
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:47,259
Come on.

767
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,902
Couldn't you have found a softer one?

768
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,302
Well, it's not for sleeping on.

769
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,431
So, if you come down through there...

770
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,136
- ...does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

771
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,272
It's going to be amazing.

772
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:08,807
Well, it has to be. Borden's
trick is getting noticed.

773
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,021
The place was packed today.

774
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:17,423
You went and saw his show again.

775
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,928
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

776
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:30,637
All I have to do is
keep myself stinking drunk,

777
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:33,040
and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

778
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,203
Have a little faith, sir.

779
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:39,181
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

780
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:04,101
You'd drink, too, if you knew
the world half as well as I do.

781
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,506
Did you think you were unique?

782
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,276
I've been Caesar, I've played Faust.

783
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:15,443
How difficult could it possibly
be to play the Great Danton?

784
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,647
You can go back to being
yourself now, Root, for nothing.

785
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,986
I'd rather be him for now.

786
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,822
I find it, uh... amusing.

787
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:28,993
"My liege,

788
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,399
I did deny no prisoners."

789
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,630
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

790
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:37,970
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

791
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,839
I don't know how you do things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

792
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:43,243
Have you thought what we should call it?

793
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:47,477
There's no point being coy. Borden
calls his trick The Transported Man.

794
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:54,551
Ladies and gentlemen, much
of what you've seen may be termed

795
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:58,391
as illusions or entertaining trifles.

796
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,124
Alas...

797
01:00:06,303 --> 01:00:08,828
...I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

798
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,934
Watch carefully.

799
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:14,810
You will see no trickery,

800
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:17,972
for no trickery is employed.

801
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:21,415
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient

802
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:23,646
and various holy men of the Himalayas.

803
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:29,950
Indeed, many of you may be
familiar with this technique,

804
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:33,190
but for those of you who
are not, do not be alarmed.

805
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:36,323
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

806
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:10,958
To our achievement.

807
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,798
The manager says he's
never seen a reaction like it.

808
01:01:13,987 --> 01:01:17,286
At least he saw it. I spent
the ovation hiding under the stage.

809
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:19,689
No one cares about
the man who disappears.

810
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,750
They care about the one who comes out.

811
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:23,887
I care about the man in the box.

812
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:28,263
Thank you. I don't know,
maybe we could switch before the trick.

813
01:01:28,334 --> 01:01:30,495
I'm the prestige,
and Root's below stage.

814
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,505
No, the anticipation
of the trick is everything.

815
01:01:33,573 --> 01:01:36,633
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

816
01:01:36,709 --> 01:01:40,270
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

817
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:43,076
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

818
01:01:43,149 --> 01:01:46,744
Root, you bloody fool,
get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

819
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:49,481
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

820
01:01:49,555 --> 01:01:51,614
Congratulations, all.

821
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:55,388
Life is not full of these
moments. We worked hard.

822
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,122
We need to celebrate properly.

823
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:03,335
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

824
01:02:03,403 --> 01:02:05,701
No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

825
01:02:05,772 --> 01:02:09,105
Borden's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

826
01:02:09,175 --> 01:02:13,043
He doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

827
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:16,013
- I need to know how he does it.
- Why?

828
01:02:16,082 --> 01:02:18,573
So I can do it better.

829
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,121
I need you to go and work for him.

830
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,888
Work for him? Are you joking?

831
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,356
You'll be my spy.

832
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:32,625
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

833
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:34,792
That's how we advance. Think of it.

834
01:02:34,867 --> 01:02:38,064
People are excited by Cutter's
version. Imagine what we'd do

835
01:02:38,137 --> 01:02:42,574
with the real illusion. We'd have the
greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

836
01:02:42,642 --> 01:02:46,408
- He knows I work for you.
- Exactly why he'll want to hire you.

837
01:02:46,479 --> 01:02:49,039
- He'll want my secret.
- Why would he trust me?

838
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:51,811
Because you're
gonna tell him the truth.

839
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:56,552
Hmm?

840
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:05,223
Good girl.

841
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:11,928
You must be curious to see what
so much money has bought you.

842
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:15,506
Fitting you should be here
for her maiden voyage.

843
01:03:15,575 --> 01:03:17,406
Your hat.

844
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,945
You might want to stand back.

845
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,533
I don't understand.

846
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:51,941
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

847
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:53,638
Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?

848
01:03:53,713 --> 01:03:55,738
- No. Come back next week.
- Next week?

849
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:58,375
- Next week, it will be fine.
- Tesla!

850
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:00,180
Just a little temperamental.

851
01:04:06,025 --> 01:04:08,926
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

852
01:04:08,995 --> 01:04:11,156
- My name is Olivia...
- I know who you are.

853
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,891
Here to steal the rest of my show?

854
01:04:12,965 --> 01:04:14,865
To give your show what it's missing.

855
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:18,165
- Yeah, what might that be?
- Me.

856
01:04:18,237 --> 01:04:22,697
I was just
saying that, wasn't I?

857
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,073
- A woman's touch.
- I've left Angier.

858
01:04:25,144 --> 01:04:27,203
- All right.
- I want a job.

859
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,611
Yeah.

860
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:30,512
I know you've no reason to trust me.

861
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,141
Why wouldn't I trust you?

862
01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:35,654
You're only the mistress of my
enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

863
01:04:37,323 --> 01:04:39,257
- Mr. Borden.
- Alfred.

864
01:04:41,694 --> 01:04:43,355
I'm going to tell you the truth.

865
01:04:43,429 --> 01:04:45,659
Now that is a slippery notion

866
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:48,063
in our line of work,
isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

867
01:04:50,169 --> 01:04:52,831
I am here because he sent me here.

868
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:55,373
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

869
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:58,808
What does he need my secret for?
His trick is topnotch.

870
01:04:58,878 --> 01:05:01,472
He vanishes,
and then he reappears instantly

871
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:04,038
on the other side
of the stage, mute, overweight

872
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:06,676
and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

873
01:05:06,752 --> 01:05:10,244
It's astonishing. How does
he do it? And tell me, Olivia,

874
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:13,781
does he enjoy taking his bows
under the stage?

875
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:17,159
It's killing him. He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

876
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,290
He thinks of nothing else,
takes no pleasure in our success.

877
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:21,856
And I've had enough.

878
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:24,334
There is no future with him.

879
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:29,202
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've come to offer you his.

880
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:33,177
This is the truth... is it?

881
01:05:37,717 --> 01:05:40,015
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

882
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:44,113
Root, you're late and more drunk than
usual. Get down below stairs right away.

883
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,919
No.

884
01:05:45,992 --> 01:05:49,359
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

885
01:05:49,428 --> 01:05:53,762
We have a problem. Cutter, Borden
is performing right across the street.

886
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:57,098
Yeah, we have a bigger problem.

887
01:05:57,169 --> 01:06:00,161
Root. He's realized
that he can make demands.

888
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,332
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

889
01:06:02,408 --> 01:06:04,376
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.

890
01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:07,037
It usually takes them
a lot longer to figure it out.

891
01:06:07,113 --> 01:06:09,673
- How much does he want?
- It makes no difference.

892
01:06:09,749 --> 01:06:13,207
- We've got to stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Look at this.

893
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:19,122
Last week they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

894
01:06:19,191 --> 01:06:22,558
Not magician, mind you.
Performer of any kind.

895
01:06:22,628 --> 01:06:25,859
- What's your point?
- My point is, you've climbed too high

896
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:28,366
to get away with
professional embarrassment.

897
01:06:28,434 --> 01:06:31,801
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

898
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:37,272
Just pay him for now. We keep
doing the trick until Borden opens,

899
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:39,311
and then we'll phase it out.

900
01:06:40,212 --> 01:06:41,702
All right.

901
01:06:44,483 --> 01:06:46,610
<i>Cutter was always surprised</i>

902
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:48,586
<i>how fast Root turned bad.</i>

903
01:06:48,654 --> 01:06:53,216
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale?

904
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:56,420
- You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
- Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

905
01:06:56,495 --> 01:07:00,158
Of course I am, but don't advertise it,
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

906
01:07:00,232 --> 01:07:02,666
<i>We paid him enough
to keep him in beers.</i>

907
01:07:02,735 --> 01:07:04,828
<i>You wouldn't expect him
to rock the boat.</i>

908
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:07,498
Many of you may be
familiar with this technique,

909
01:07:07,573 --> 01:07:11,065
but for those of you
who aren't, do not be alarmed.

910
01:07:11,143 --> 01:07:14,306
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

911
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,009
- And who are you?
- I am a humble admirer

912
01:07:18,084 --> 01:07:20,678
and a fellow practitioner.

913
01:07:20,753 --> 01:07:23,119
Mmm. Very good.

914
01:07:32,498 --> 01:07:35,331
- Another one?
- Oh, if you insist.

915
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:38,131
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

916
01:07:38,204 --> 01:07:40,229
I'm only doing one show,
but to be frank,

917
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,638
my people pretty much
run things these days.

918
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:43,902
Get up there.

919
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:46,335
Get up!

920
01:07:46,412 --> 01:07:49,176
Your illusion, The Transported Man,

921
01:07:49,248 --> 01:07:51,842
I'm not claiming to know your methods,

922
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:56,115
but I had a similar trick in my act,

923
01:07:56,188 --> 01:07:59,021
and, uh... I used a double.

924
01:07:59,091 --> 01:08:04,290
- Mm, I see, very good.
- Well, it was, and then it went bad.

925
01:08:04,363 --> 01:08:07,764
What I didn't count on was that
when I incorporated this bloke

926
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,926
into my act,

927
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,993
he had complete power over me.

928
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:14,766
Complete power, you say?

929
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:32,189
Ohh!

930
01:08:32,258 --> 01:08:37,525
Be very careful giving
someone that power over you.

931
01:08:37,596 --> 01:08:41,930
Huh. Thank you. Um...

932
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:44,868
Yes, thank you for the warning.

933
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:47,633
Hmm. Cheers.

934
01:08:49,075 --> 01:08:51,202
I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

935
01:08:51,277 --> 01:08:54,644
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

936
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:00,646
Ahh!

937
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:37,845
Oh! The Great Danton.

938
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,928
I apologize.

939
01:09:45,998 --> 01:09:49,764
There simply is too much magic...

940
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:52,599
...for my stage at The Pantages

941
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:54,832
across the street.

942
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:01,813
Pardon my intrusion.

943
01:10:03,883 --> 01:10:08,286
And go easy on the poor chap.
He does try so very hard.

944
01:10:11,157 --> 01:10:13,591
I don't know how Borden found him.

945
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:15,559
Kept him under wraps. I was careful.

946
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,289
Yeah, well, he did.

947
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,455
Do you think it was her?

948
01:10:26,705 --> 01:10:29,674
You weren't expecting me?

949
01:10:29,742 --> 01:10:32,472
I expected you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

950
01:10:32,545 --> 01:10:34,809
It takes a bit for me
to get around these days.

951
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,941
He's taken everything from me.
My wife, my career,

952
01:10:39,018 --> 01:10:40,883
- now you.
- You sent me.

953
01:10:40,953 --> 01:10:44,013
I sent you to steal his secret,
not to improve his act.

954
01:10:44,089 --> 01:10:45,647
- It's my job.
- Or fall in love!

955
01:10:45,724 --> 01:10:48,488
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

956
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:51,052
- How does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

957
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,360
- 'Course he said that.
- He didn't say it.

958
01:10:53,432 --> 01:10:56,868
I've seen things, makeup, glasses, wigs.
We don't use for the show.

959
01:10:56,936 --> 01:10:59,666
- I've seen it hidden backstage.
- Misdirection.

960
01:10:59,738 --> 01:11:02,434
He leaves them lying
around to make you think that.

961
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,373
He doesn't know when I'm looking.

962
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:07,674
All the time, Olivia! That's who he is!

963
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:09,008
That's what it takes!

964
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:11,515
He lives his act, don't you see?

965
01:11:13,552 --> 01:11:16,919
Just because you're sleeping
with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

966
01:11:16,989 --> 01:11:19,389
You think you can see
everything, don't you?

967
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:22,291
The Great Danton is a blind fool.

968
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,760
His notebook.

969
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:27,394
You stole it?

970
01:11:27,466 --> 01:11:29,263
I borrowed it for tonight.

971
01:11:29,335 --> 01:11:31,530
I thought you could translate
some of it...

972
01:11:31,604 --> 01:11:35,665
I can't. No one can. It's a cipher.

973
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:39,177
Even with the keyword,
it will take months to decode.

974
01:11:39,245 --> 01:11:42,146
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

975
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,841
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

976
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:46,851
If I don't get that back by
tomorrow he'll know I took it.

977
01:11:46,919 --> 01:11:49,217
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

978
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:55,357
This is his diary, Olivia. All of his
secrets are right here in my hands.

979
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:57,620
It won't bring your wife back.

980
01:11:57,696 --> 01:12:00,392
I don't care about my wife.
I care about his secret.

981
01:12:13,646 --> 01:12:16,376
Look, I'll, um...

982
01:12:16,448 --> 01:12:18,780
I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

983
01:12:18,851 --> 01:12:22,048
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

984
01:12:23,155 --> 01:12:25,146
Understand?

985
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,588
Robert.

986
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:39,800
I have fallen in love with him.

987
01:12:40,706 --> 01:12:43,174
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

988
01:12:51,717 --> 01:12:53,207
Notebook?

989
01:12:55,854 --> 01:12:57,845
Then he's just getting started.

990
01:13:27,086 --> 01:13:28,553
Professor!

991
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,110
Good evening.

992
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,620
I'm walking tonight.

993
01:13:36,695 --> 01:13:39,255
Let him come. I don't care.

994
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:42,027
Professor! Professor!

995
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,849
Ahh!

996
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,478
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

997
01:15:08,554 --> 01:15:10,647
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

998
01:15:24,736 --> 01:15:27,296
- I'm impressed.
- Why is that?

999
01:15:27,372 --> 01:15:30,341
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

1000
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:33,310
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

1001
01:15:33,378 --> 01:15:36,176
Risk, sacrifice.

1002
01:15:36,248 --> 01:15:38,739
The sacrifice, I'm afraid,
is all gonna be yours,

1003
01:15:38,817 --> 01:15:40,444
unless you give me what I want.

1004
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,947
- Which is?
- Your secret.

1005
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:45,421
My secret?

1006
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:48,619
Your method for The Transported Man.

1007
01:15:48,694 --> 01:15:51,527
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't talk at all.

1008
01:15:51,597 --> 01:15:55,089
- You have my notebook.
- Useless without the keyword.

1009
01:15:56,568 --> 01:16:00,129
Write down your method,
Mr. Borden, describe it in full.

1010
01:16:13,252 --> 01:16:15,618
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

1011
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:18,087
I don't know if your secret's
in your notebook.

1012
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:20,624
The keyword is the method.

1013
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,927
<i>Where's my ingnieur?</i>

1014
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:35,699
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

1015
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:41,202
Fallon, you hear me? Fallon!

1016
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,176
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

1017
01:16:46,618 --> 01:16:48,176
Did you find your answer?

1018
01:16:48,253 --> 01:16:52,019
Our answer, Cutter. I haven't
looked yet. I wanted you to share this.

1019
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:54,524
I already know how he does it, Robert.

1020
01:16:54,593 --> 01:16:57,687
Same way he always has,
the same way as we do.

1021
01:16:57,763 --> 01:17:00,231
It's just that you want something more.

1022
01:17:00,299 --> 01:17:03,063
Well, let's find out then, shall we?

1023
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:08,805
What does it mean?

1024
01:17:16,648 --> 01:17:19,116
It means, Cutter, we have
a journey ahead of us.

1025
01:17:19,184 --> 01:17:22,051
- To America.
- Robert?

1026
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,089
Listen to me.

1027
01:17:25,157 --> 01:17:28,615
Obsession is a young man's game.

1028
01:17:28,694 --> 01:17:30,218
Come on.

1029
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:32,763
I can't follow you any further in it.

1030
01:17:33,832 --> 01:17:35,766
I can't, I'm sorry.

1031
01:17:39,871 --> 01:17:41,566
Then the rest is up to me.

1032
01:17:43,642 --> 01:17:45,166
I'm sorry.

1033
01:17:50,482 --> 01:17:54,077
Good evening. Hello, darling.

1034
01:17:54,152 --> 01:17:55,642
Champagne, your finest.

1035
01:17:55,721 --> 01:17:58,417
I didn't know we were going
to be joined for dinner.

1036
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:00,788
Absolutely, we are celebrating.

1037
01:18:00,859 --> 01:18:02,554
Miss Wenscombe, Mr. Fallon.

1038
01:18:03,562 --> 01:18:06,429
- What are we celebrating?
- We've hit upon a new trick.

1039
01:18:06,498 --> 01:18:08,557
- Haven't we?
- What trick, Freddie?

1040
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:10,659
Yes, Freddie, what trick?

1041
01:18:10,736 --> 01:18:15,139
I am going to bury
myself alive every night,

1042
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:19,075
and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

1043
01:18:19,144 --> 01:18:22,238
- I think he's had quite enough...
- No, pour the champagne.

1044
01:18:22,314 --> 01:18:26,011
Pour the... Sarah, don't talk to me
like that. I'm not a bloody child.

1045
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:29,281
- Perhaps it would be better...
- Mr. Fallon, escort her home.

1046
01:18:29,354 --> 01:18:32,187
- My husband's being a bore.
- Oh, please.

1047
01:18:32,257 --> 01:18:36,057
- I see no reason you should suffer.
- Don't ruin this evening.

1048
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:41,364
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddie.

1049
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:48,102
- Freddie?
- That's my name.

1050
01:18:48,173 --> 01:18:51,540
- Not at home.
- I'm not always at home, am I?

1051
01:18:53,345 --> 01:18:56,007
Couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1052
01:18:56,081 --> 01:19:00,245
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1053
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:03,378
All right? I'm out in public.
Everybody else loves it.

1054
01:19:03,455 --> 01:19:05,389
Why are you being like this?

1055
01:19:05,457 --> 01:19:08,358
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1056
01:19:08,427 --> 01:19:12,193
I thought that
something very precious...

1057
01:19:13,365 --> 01:19:15,299
...had been lost to me.

1058
01:19:15,367 --> 01:19:18,495
So I just wanted
to celebrate just a little.

1059
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:22,028
All right, what? What did you lose?

1060
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,737
I see, more secrets.

1061
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,844
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1062
01:19:34,786 --> 01:19:38,051
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop, this isn't you.

1063
01:19:38,123 --> 01:19:40,591
Stop performing.

1064
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,241
I thought I had the place to myself.

1065
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:10,618
Unexpected guests, not very polite.

1066
01:20:10,689 --> 01:20:12,520
A lot of questions.

1067
01:20:12,591 --> 01:20:15,389
At first, I thought they
worked for the government.

1068
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:19,123
- No?
- Worse, they work for Thomas Edison.

1069
01:20:21,099 --> 01:20:23,590
<i>Today, a most
curious development.</i>

1070
01:20:23,668 --> 01:20:26,728
<i>His assistant came to us
with a proposition.</i>

1071
01:20:28,373 --> 01:20:31,774
<i>Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.</i>

1072
01:20:31,843 --> 01:20:34,641
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

1073
01:20:34,713 --> 01:20:38,479
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've come to offer you his.

1074
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:41,519
This is the truth...

1075
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:42,575
...is it?

1076
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:54,087
No, that's what he told
me to tell you. The truth...

1077
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:58,000
...is that I loved him and I stood by
him and he sent me to you,

1078
01:20:58,069 --> 01:21:01,596
like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1079
01:21:01,673 --> 01:21:04,471
I hate him for that.

1080
01:21:04,543 --> 01:21:07,774
I could spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

1081
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:11,745
So, what could you
possibly have to offer me?

1082
01:21:11,817 --> 01:21:13,444
You may know his tricks,

1083
01:21:13,518 --> 01:21:16,578
but you can't understand why
no one sees yours are better.

1084
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:19,215
You hide this.
I had to look very closely

1085
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,623
to spot it
during The Transported Man,

1086
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:24,526
but this makes you unique.

1087
01:21:24,596 --> 01:21:26,621
It shows you aren't using a double.

1088
01:21:26,698 --> 01:21:29,189
You mustn't hide it.
You must display it proudly.

1089
01:21:29,267 --> 01:21:34,034
I'm sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand.

1090
01:21:34,105 --> 01:21:35,868
Yeah, it does.

1091
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:40,805
So let people know.

1092
01:21:40,879 --> 01:21:44,371
You can be so much more than
he is and I can show you how.

1093
01:21:46,084 --> 01:21:48,678
<i>I think
she's telling the truth.</i>

1094
01:21:48,753 --> 01:21:50,880
<i>I think we cannot trust her.</i>

1095
01:21:54,426 --> 01:21:56,894
<i>But I love her. I need her.</i>

1096
01:21:58,096 --> 01:22:01,429
<i>To open myself to such a relationship,</i>

1097
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:05,333
<i>to the dangers of such an affair,</i>

1098
01:22:05,403 --> 01:22:10,204
<i>I need assurances of fidelity, of love.</i>

1099
01:22:11,243 --> 01:22:12,835
<i>But how to be sure?</i>

1100
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:19,380
<i>I know a way. It's the only
way to know her mind.</i>

1101
01:22:19,451 --> 01:22:21,282
How could he send you away?

1102
01:22:23,154 --> 01:22:26,248
<i>She must help me
rid ourselves of Angier.</i>

1103
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,856
<i>Today, my mistress
proves her truthfulness.</i>

1104
01:22:35,934 --> 01:22:37,663
<i>Not to me, you understand.</i>

1105
01:22:37,736 --> 01:22:40,364
<i>I've been
convinced since she led me to Root.</i>

1106
01:22:40,438 --> 01:22:43,965
<i>Today, Olivia proves her love for me</i>

1107
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,510
<i>to you, Angier.</i>

1108
01:22:46,578 --> 01:22:50,981
<i>Yes, Angier, she gave you
this notebook at my request.</i>

1109
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:54,485
<i>And yes, "Tesla" is merely
the key to my dairy,</i>

1110
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:57,350
<i>not to my trick.
You really think I'd part</i>

1111
01:22:57,422 --> 01:23:00,550
<i>with my secret so easily after so much?</i>

1112
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:02,286
<i>Goodbye, Angier.</i>

1113
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,726
<i>May you find solace
for your forward ambition</i>

1114
01:23:04,796 --> 01:23:06,593
<i>back in your American home.</i>

1115
01:23:16,107 --> 01:23:17,734
Tesla!

1116
01:23:19,678 --> 01:23:22,078
Tesla! Alley!

1117
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:24,270
Alley!

1118
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:26,943
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1119
01:23:27,018 --> 01:23:29,816
- I never said he had.
- You let me believe that he had.

1120
01:23:29,888 --> 01:23:32,584
You stole my money because
your funding was cut off.

1121
01:23:32,657 --> 01:23:35,558
You've been shooting
sparks in my top hat,

1122
01:23:35,627 --> 01:23:39,119
laughing at me all along,
while using my money to stave off ruin.

1123
01:23:39,965 --> 01:23:42,092
- I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

1124
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:44,658
In the hotel, I have a mind
to bring them up here.

1125
01:23:44,736 --> 01:23:47,432
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1126
01:23:47,505 --> 01:23:50,633
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier,

1127
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:52,574
but we have not stolen your money.

1128
01:23:52,644 --> 01:23:54,111
This is my cat.

1129
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:57,239
When I told you I could make you
a machine, I spoke a truth.

1130
01:23:57,315 --> 01:23:58,407
Why isn't it working?

1131
01:23:58,483 --> 01:24:00,815
Because exact science, Mr. Angier,

1132
01:24:00,885 --> 01:24:02,284
is not an exact science.

1133
01:24:02,354 --> 01:24:05,517
The machine simply
does not operate as expected.

1134
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,617
- It requires further examination.
- So where did my top hat go?

1135
01:24:09,694 --> 01:24:10,752
Nowhere.

1136
01:24:10,829 --> 01:24:13,627
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1137
01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:15,325
The hat went nowhere.

1138
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,300
We need to try different material.

1139
01:24:17,369 --> 01:24:19,530
It may provoke a different result.

1140
01:24:22,173 --> 01:24:23,731
Great.

1141
01:24:30,882 --> 01:24:34,841
You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal, doctor.

1142
01:24:56,374 --> 01:24:59,002
I hope whatever you were
really doing with my money

1143
01:24:59,077 --> 01:25:01,511
was more worthwhile, Mr. Tesla.

1144
01:25:57,435 --> 01:25:58,424
Alley!

1145
01:26:01,506 --> 01:26:03,235
So the machine was working?

1146
01:26:03,308 --> 01:26:06,937
I never checked the calibration,
'cause the hat never moved.

1147
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:09,878
These things never quite
work as you expect them to.

1148
01:26:09,948 --> 01:26:12,439
That's one of the principal
beauties of science.

1149
01:26:12,517 --> 01:26:15,975
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

1150
01:26:16,054 --> 01:26:18,113
We'll send word when it's ready.

1151
01:26:20,325 --> 01:26:23,294
Don't forget your hat.

1152
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:27,092
- Well, which one is mine?
- They are all your hats.

1153
01:26:33,037 --> 01:26:36,029
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

1154
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:39,941
- Are we going to the zoo?
- No, Daddy has some errands to run.

1155
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:42,241
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

1156
01:26:42,313 --> 01:26:44,611
Then go to the zoo, we shall.

1157
01:26:44,682 --> 01:26:48,140
Daddy will go run his errands,
and I'll be back before you know it.

1158
01:26:48,219 --> 01:26:51,950
So you go get ready. We'll go
see those chimpanzees.

1159
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:58,360
Sarah... what are you doing?

1160
01:27:02,033 --> 01:27:05,025
Each of us have our vices.

1161
01:27:08,139 --> 01:27:10,607
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1162
01:27:12,177 --> 01:27:15,806
...your only competition
for my affections is our little girl.

1163
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,849
I love you. I will always love you

1164
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:20,350
and you alone.

1165
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:26,020
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

1166
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:29,924
Which makes it so much
harder when you don't.

1167
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:42,068
More shopping. She does
love the smell of money.

1168
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:46,440
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her, yeah?

1169
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,877
I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not.

1170
01:27:48,947 --> 01:27:52,246
And, uh... Sarah,

1171
01:27:52,317 --> 01:27:54,444
she knows.

1172
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:58,683
Uh, at least she knows
that something is not right,

1173
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:01,657
so if you can just do
whatever you can to help me.

1174
01:28:01,726 --> 01:28:06,288
Talk to her, just
convince her that I do love her.

1175
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:18,909
What is it, Freddie?

1176
01:28:18,977 --> 01:28:21,275
Listen, don't call me that, please.

1177
01:28:21,346 --> 01:28:25,214
It's nothing. It's just that
sometimes it seems wrong.

1178
01:28:25,283 --> 01:28:27,774
I told you, when you're
with me, you're with me.

1179
01:28:27,852 --> 01:28:30,878
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

1180
01:28:30,955 --> 01:28:34,220
I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia.

1181
01:28:34,292 --> 01:28:36,658
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

1182
01:28:38,162 --> 01:28:41,188
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1183
01:28:41,266 --> 01:28:43,734
There's something about
that man I don't trust.

1184
01:28:43,801 --> 01:28:46,861
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1185
01:28:46,938 --> 01:28:49,600
He protects the things
that I care about.

1186
01:29:27,845 --> 01:29:30,336
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1187
01:29:30,415 --> 01:29:32,975
We were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave, as well.

1188
01:29:33,051 --> 01:29:35,144
He's very good to Colorado Springs.

1189
01:29:35,219 --> 01:29:37,881
Mr. Angier,

1190
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:41,584
I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

1191
01:29:41,659 --> 01:29:43,320
What box?

1192
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:12,054
<i>I apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye.</i>

1193
01:30:12,123 --> 01:30:17,356
<i>But I seem to have outstayed
my welcome in Colorado.</i>

1194
01:30:17,428 --> 01:30:21,922
<i>The truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry.</i>

1195
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:24,797
<i>Perhaps you'll find
more luck in your field,</i>

1196
01:30:24,869 --> 01:30:27,531
<i>where people are happy to be mystified.</i>

1197
01:30:27,605 --> 01:30:31,564
<i>You will find what you
are looking for in this box.</i>

1198
01:30:31,642 --> 01:30:36,079
<i>Alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions.</i>

1199
01:30:36,147 --> 01:30:40,880
<i>I add only one suggestion
on using the machine.</i>

1200
01:30:40,952 --> 01:30:42,920
<i>Destroy it.</i>

1201
01:30:42,987 --> 01:30:46,286
<i>Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.</i>

1202
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:49,758
<i>Such a thing will bring you only misery.</i>

1203
01:30:53,631 --> 01:30:57,260
<i>Tesla's warning is
as unheeded as he knew it would be.</i>

1204
01:30:57,335 --> 01:31:00,896
<i>Today I tested the machine.
Taking precautions in case</i>

1205
01:31:00,972 --> 01:31:03,941
<i>Tesla hadn't ironed out
the kinks in its operation.</i>

1206
01:31:04,008 --> 01:31:05,805
<i>But if it went wrong,</i>

1207
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,038
<i>I would not want to live
like that for long.</i>

1208
01:31:27,498 --> 01:31:31,628
<i>But here at the turn,
I must leave you, Borden.</i>

1209
01:31:31,702 --> 01:31:33,932
<i>Yes, you, Borden,</i>

1210
01:31:34,005 --> 01:31:36,371
<i>sitting there in your cell,</i>

1211
01:31:36,441 --> 01:31:40,468
<i>reading my diary, awaiting your death,</i>

1212
01:31:40,545 --> 01:31:42,536
<i>for my murder.</i>

1213
01:31:47,885 --> 01:31:51,184
Angier's journal, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

1214
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:52,552
I assure you, it's not.

1215
01:31:52,623 --> 01:31:55,558
The provenance of the journal
is clear and under no doubt.

1216
01:31:55,626 --> 01:32:00,120
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
for which we have numerous examples.

1217
01:32:01,999 --> 01:32:03,899
It don't matter.

1218
01:32:05,837 --> 01:32:07,862
So my tricks.

1219
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:14,566
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

1220
01:32:16,013 --> 01:32:19,210
- Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
- No, he won't.

1221
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:21,649
They're not complete.

1222
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:24,449
It's just the pledge
and the turn for each.

1223
01:32:24,522 --> 01:32:28,583
Without the prestige for these
tricks, these are worthless.

1224
01:32:28,659 --> 01:32:30,684
Yeah.

1225
01:32:30,761 --> 01:32:34,288
You get the rest of it...
when you bring my daughter here.

1226
01:32:37,034 --> 01:32:39,264
I want to say goodbye.

1227
01:32:41,005 --> 01:32:44,168
We have to go through it now.
We have to go through it now.

1228
01:32:44,242 --> 01:32:46,608
Now, listen to me, deny it all you want.

1229
01:32:46,677 --> 01:32:49,043
Olivia means nothing.

1230
01:32:49,113 --> 01:32:50,910
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

1231
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:53,815
- I'll go to her, I'll tell her.
- You'll tell her what?

1232
01:32:53,885 --> 01:32:55,944
I know what you really are, Alfred.

1233
01:32:58,055 --> 01:32:59,818
- I know.
- Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

1234
01:32:59,891 --> 01:33:02,519
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

1235
01:33:02,593 --> 01:33:05,118
- No. No.
- Sarah, shut up! Sarah, shut up!

1236
01:33:05,196 --> 01:33:09,326
I don't want to hear it anymore.
You can't talk like this.

1237
01:33:11,936 --> 01:33:15,337
You can't hide it anymore,
because I know, Alfred, I know.

1238
01:33:15,406 --> 01:33:18,842
I know what you really are, Alfred.

1239
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:21,708
I can't live like this.

1240
01:33:21,779 --> 01:33:23,906
Oh, well, you think
I can live like this?

1241
01:33:23,981 --> 01:33:27,144
You think I bloody enjoy
living like this?

1242
01:33:27,218 --> 01:33:31,621
We have this beautiful house,
lovely little girl, we're married.

1243
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:33,350
What is so wrong with your life?

1244
01:33:33,424 --> 01:33:36,018
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1245
01:33:36,093 --> 01:33:38,459
Well, what do you want from me?

1246
01:33:41,799 --> 01:33:45,496
I... I want...

1247
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:48,630
I want you to be... honest with me.

1248
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,843
No tricks.

1249
01:33:53,911 --> 01:33:56,004
No lies.

1250
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,880
And no secrets.

1251
01:34:06,157 --> 01:34:09,490
Do you... do you love me?

1252
01:34:12,563 --> 01:34:14,190
Not today.

1253
01:34:16,334 --> 01:34:17,392
No.

1254
01:35:55,066 --> 01:35:56,090
Who's there?

1255
01:35:59,236 --> 01:36:01,329
I'm looking for an old friend.

1256
01:36:01,405 --> 01:36:04,340
I heard about a booking,
nice little theater,

1257
01:36:04,408 --> 01:36:06,842
- good up-and-coming magician.
- You're back.

1258
01:36:06,911 --> 01:36:08,503
It's good to see you, John.

1259
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:12,010
Good rehearsal space.

1260
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,847
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1261
01:36:14,919 --> 01:36:17,581
You always had a good eye for publicity.

1262
01:36:17,655 --> 01:36:18,986
I need your help, John.

1263
01:36:19,056 --> 01:36:21,854
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1264
01:36:21,926 --> 01:36:23,553
Your last show?

1265
01:36:23,627 --> 01:36:27,757
A wise man once told me obsession
was a young man's game.

1266
01:36:27,832 --> 01:36:31,393
I'm almost done. There's one thing left.

1267
01:36:32,403 --> 01:36:34,928
The Real Transported Man.

1268
01:36:36,741 --> 01:36:38,732
You want to design a show around it?

1269
01:36:38,809 --> 01:36:41,676
I don't want you backstage
I need you in front managing.

1270
01:36:41,746 --> 01:36:44,408
Call in any favors
or connections you have left

1271
01:36:44,482 --> 01:36:45,949
to get us the right booking.

1272
01:36:46,016 --> 01:36:48,109
What sort of booking you after?

1273
01:36:48,185 --> 01:36:50,585
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1274
01:36:56,961 --> 01:37:00,192
Oh, what an honor it is
to see you again, sir.

1275
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:04,223
You told me you only wanted to show me
one trick that'd pique my interest.

1276
01:37:04,301 --> 01:37:07,464
- It's a very clever trick.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.

1277
01:37:07,538 --> 01:37:10,405
Likewise, I'm sure.
Let's get on, shall we?

1278
01:37:14,044 --> 01:37:15,807
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1279
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:22,177
Very pretty.

1280
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:36,893
That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?

1281
01:37:36,967 --> 01:37:39,333
That's not a trick. He has to come back.

1282
01:37:39,403 --> 01:37:41,564
- There has to be a...
- A prestige?

1283
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:42,628
Exactly.

1284
01:37:45,643 --> 01:37:48,305
Pardon me.

1285
01:37:48,379 --> 01:37:51,644
It's very rare to see...

1286
01:37:51,715 --> 01:37:53,182
...real magic.

1287
01:37:54,685 --> 01:37:56,380
It's been many years since...

1288
01:37:56,453 --> 01:37:58,182
Are you interested in helping us?

1289
01:38:00,257 --> 01:38:03,988
Yes... but you'll have
to dress it up a little.

1290
01:38:06,263 --> 01:38:07,924
Disguise it.

1291
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,091
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1292
01:38:12,903 --> 01:38:16,134
You haven't spoken
about her, Freddie, not once.

1293
01:38:16,207 --> 01:38:19,904
Why would I talk about her to you, hm?

1294
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:23,845
Because she was a part of
your life and now she's gone.

1295
01:38:26,817 --> 01:38:31,311
You know, the day before she killed
herself she said she wanted to meet me.

1296
01:38:31,388 --> 01:38:34,323
That she had something
to tell me about you.

1297
01:38:34,391 --> 01:38:37,986
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1298
01:38:38,062 --> 01:38:39,552
But...

1299
01:38:40,764 --> 01:38:43,028
...what would she have said?

1300
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,194
You want to know the truth about me?

1301
01:38:47,471 --> 01:38:49,962
The truth is that...

1302
01:38:52,142 --> 01:38:54,133
...I never loved Sarah.

1303
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:56,836
I never loved her.

1304
01:38:56,914 --> 01:38:59,144
You married her,
you had a child with her.

1305
01:38:59,216 --> 01:39:02,310
Yes. Part of me. Part of me did, but...

1306
01:39:02,386 --> 01:39:04,320
...the other part didn't.

1307
01:39:04,388 --> 01:39:08,620
The part that found you,
the part that's sitting here right now.

1308
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:11,752
I love you. No, Olivia, I love you.

1309
01:39:11,829 --> 01:39:13,797
That's the truth.

1310
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:16,264
That is the truth that matters.

1311
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:20,736
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now,

1312
01:39:20,804 --> 01:39:22,396
talking about me that way.

1313
01:39:22,473 --> 01:39:24,600
- No.
- Yes.

1314
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:31,776
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1315
01:39:37,454 --> 01:39:38,716
He's back.

1316
01:39:39,623 --> 01:39:42,888
After two years, he's got a new trick.

1317
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,622
They're saying it's
the best London's ever seen.

1318
01:39:47,831 --> 01:39:50,299
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

1319
01:39:52,169 --> 01:39:54,103
You should go to him.

1320
01:39:54,171 --> 01:39:56,696
You two deserve each other.

1321
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,615
But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow
Ballet plays through next year.

1322
01:40:05,683 --> 01:40:10,245
Then get rid of them. There will be
100 performances, no more, no less.

1323
01:40:10,321 --> 01:40:12,812
Five performances a week, no matinees.

1324
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:17,651
That's what you'll
charge for each ticket. Good day.

1325
01:40:40,384 --> 01:40:45,014
Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of
the evening involves considerable risk.

1326
01:40:46,256 --> 01:40:47,621
Anyone in the audience

1327
01:40:47,691 --> 01:40:50,524
who would be irrevocably
damaged by seeing a man drown

1328
01:40:50,594 --> 01:40:52,186
should leave now.

1329
01:40:52,262 --> 01:40:55,060
When I tell you the lady
who taught me this illusion

1330
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:57,123
actually died performing it,

1331
01:40:57,201 --> 01:41:00,500
you'll understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved.

1332
01:41:02,673 --> 01:41:05,073
Let's begin.

1333
01:41:14,785 --> 01:41:17,413
In my travels, I have seen the future.

1334
01:41:19,223 --> 01:41:22,818
And it is a strange future, indeed.

1335
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:25,054
The world, ladies and gentlemen,

1336
01:41:25,129 --> 01:41:27,427
is on the brink of new

1337
01:41:27,498 --> 01:41:29,227
and terrifying possibilities.

1338
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:53,178
What you're about to witness
is not magic.

1339
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:55,757
It's purely science.

1340
01:41:55,826 --> 01:41:58,260
I'd like to invite you
to come up on stage now

1341
01:41:58,328 --> 01:42:01,320
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

1342
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:58,451
Man's reach

1343
01:42:58,522 --> 01:43:01,650
exceeds his imagination.

1344
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:14,301
Bravo!

1345
01:43:22,346 --> 01:43:25,076
One hundred performances. Why?

1346
01:43:25,149 --> 01:43:26,707
Does his method dictate that?

1347
01:43:26,783 --> 01:43:28,683
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1348
01:43:28,752 --> 01:43:31,118
He's a no-talent magician,
and they call him

1349
01:43:31,188 --> 01:43:33,588
the bloody best in England. Why?

1350
01:43:33,657 --> 01:43:36,421
Fifty yards in a second! In a second!

1351
01:43:36,493 --> 01:43:39,587
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

1352
01:43:39,663 --> 01:43:43,929
Brilliant! What is going on
under that stage? Huh?!

1353
01:43:44,001 --> 01:43:46,435
Why can't you out-think him?

1354
01:44:01,552 --> 01:44:06,751
They do this every night,
after each performance. Yeah?

1355
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:34,381
Huh.

1356
01:44:35,252 --> 01:44:38,221
We're done.

1357
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,081
All right?

1358
01:44:42,392 --> 01:44:44,155
Let him have his trick.

1359
01:44:44,228 --> 01:44:46,719
I don't need his secret.

1360
01:44:46,797 --> 01:44:48,287
So...

1361
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,769
...don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

1362
01:44:52,836 --> 01:44:56,101
Both of us... just leave him alone.

1363
01:44:56,173 --> 01:44:57,800
We're done.

1364
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,609
I told you, John.

1365
01:45:08,685 --> 01:45:10,778
I don't want you backstage on this one.

1366
01:45:12,422 --> 01:45:14,822
I would like to
invite you onstage now

1367
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,587
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

1368
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:50,521
- Hey, where do you think...?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1369
01:45:59,536 --> 01:46:00,525
Who was that?

1370
01:46:57,094 --> 01:47:01,224
Hey! Where's the bloody key?!

1371
01:47:01,298 --> 01:47:02,856
Where's the bloody key?!

1372
01:47:05,302 --> 01:47:09,033
Where's the bloody key?!
He's bloody drowning!

1373
01:47:18,281 --> 01:47:19,270
Hold on!

1374
01:47:24,588 --> 01:47:26,055
What have you done?

1375
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:53,316
Alfred Borden, you have been found
guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

1376
01:47:53,383 --> 01:47:57,615
You will be hanged
by the neck until dead.

1377
01:47:57,687 --> 01:48:00,656
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1378
01:48:02,426 --> 01:48:04,587
Mr. Cutter?

1379
01:48:04,661 --> 01:48:06,288
Owens.

1380
01:48:06,363 --> 01:48:09,196
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1381
01:48:09,266 --> 01:48:13,635
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1382
01:48:13,703 --> 01:48:15,295
But I notice from this manifest

1383
01:48:15,372 --> 01:48:19,069
that Lord Caldlow has purchased
the bulk of the items.

1384
01:48:19,142 --> 01:48:22,441
Mr. Cutter, if you need to know
where to deliver these items...

1385
01:48:22,512 --> 01:48:26,107
No, it's just there is
one particular item,

1386
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:29,644
this item, in fact,

1387
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:31,983
- I would like to...
- You would like to...

1388
01:48:32,055 --> 01:48:33,147
...buy.

1389
01:48:33,223 --> 01:48:35,123
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

1390
01:48:36,359 --> 01:48:38,293
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

1391
01:48:38,361 --> 01:48:40,591
Well, I'm afraid
Lord Caldlow was adamant

1392
01:48:40,664 --> 01:48:42,894
about purchasing this particular item.

1393
01:48:42,966 --> 01:48:46,060
Do you think I could
talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

1394
01:48:46,136 --> 01:48:48,900
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1395
01:48:51,341 --> 01:48:53,241
Of course,

1396
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:56,541
I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements,

1397
01:48:56,613 --> 01:49:01,073
your paths were to cross,
I can't stop you speaking your mind.

1398
01:49:02,052 --> 01:49:03,178
Thank you.

1399
01:49:04,754 --> 01:49:06,915
- Still here, Borden?
- For now.

1400
01:49:07,524 --> 01:49:10,493
You got a visitor. Lord Caldlow.

1401
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,653
With a little girl.

1402
01:49:20,937 --> 01:49:22,837
Jess?

1403
01:49:22,906 --> 01:49:24,533
Hello, my love.

1404
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:28,066
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1405
01:49:28,144 --> 01:49:30,271
Fallon's missed you too. We both have.

1406
01:49:30,347 --> 01:49:32,679
Daddy, can I come in there?

1407
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:35,944
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1408
01:49:36,019 --> 01:49:38,283
No, but everything
is gonna be all right.

1409
01:49:39,856 --> 01:49:41,585
You must be Lord Caldlow?

1410
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:45,389
Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.

1411
01:49:50,433 --> 01:49:52,628
They flatter you with all those chains.

1412
01:49:52,702 --> 01:49:55,728
Don't they know you can't escape
without your rubber ball?

1413
01:49:55,805 --> 01:49:58,797
I pulled you out... out of that tank.

1414
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:02,709
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician.

1415
01:50:02,779 --> 01:50:04,679
But you couldn't leave me alone.

1416
01:50:06,182 --> 01:50:08,275
I don't know what you've done.

1417
01:50:10,186 --> 01:50:13,883
But you're not afraid to get
your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1418
01:50:13,957 --> 01:50:17,222
No, not anymore. And I win.

1419
01:50:17,294 --> 01:50:20,627
No one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

1420
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:21,823
You win?

1421
01:50:23,266 --> 01:50:27,930
This ain't a bloody competition
anymore. This is my little girl's life.

1422
01:50:28,004 --> 01:50:30,996
And don't you dare
put her in the middle of this.

1423
01:50:31,074 --> 01:50:34,066
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special

1424
01:50:34,144 --> 01:50:36,510
taken away from you, don't I, Borden?

1425
01:50:37,514 --> 01:50:40,244
And you can't take it
with you, now, can you?

1426
01:50:40,317 --> 01:50:42,217
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1427
01:50:42,285 --> 01:50:44,310
Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.

1428
01:50:44,387 --> 01:50:46,150
No, no, no, no, stop, my darling.

1429
01:50:46,222 --> 01:50:48,349
Look, here.

1430
01:50:49,893 --> 01:50:53,158
That's what you're after.
That's what this is about.

1431
01:50:53,964 --> 01:50:55,329
Take it.

1432
01:50:55,398 --> 01:50:57,093
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1433
01:51:00,303 --> 01:51:03,864
You always were the better magician.
We both know that.

1434
01:51:04,507 --> 01:51:07,101
Whatever your secret was,
you have to agree,

1435
01:51:08,244 --> 01:51:09,575
mine is better.

1436
01:51:11,281 --> 01:51:14,648
Don't do this. Don't do this,
Angier. Jess, Jess!

1437
01:51:14,718 --> 01:51:18,245
Jess, I'm gonna take you
home soon. I promise.

1438
01:51:18,321 --> 01:51:20,881
- For God's sake.
- I promise. Look!

1439
01:51:24,728 --> 01:51:28,323
I promise. I love you, Jess.

1440
01:51:28,398 --> 01:51:30,059
I love you.

1441
01:51:30,133 --> 01:51:31,760
- Come on.
- I love you.

1442
01:51:31,835 --> 01:51:33,530
I love you, Jess.

1443
01:51:33,603 --> 01:51:35,935
Angier! Angier!

1444
01:51:36,006 --> 01:51:38,099
What, do you think
this place can hold me?

1445
01:51:38,174 --> 01:51:41,200
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1446
01:51:41,277 --> 01:51:43,802
And you can put a stop to this now!

1447
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:46,642
Listen! Listen! That man...

1448
01:51:46,716 --> 01:51:49,082
Listen, that man is
the one I'm in for killing!

1449
01:51:49,152 --> 01:51:53,486
Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty!

1450
01:51:53,556 --> 01:51:55,820
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care!

1451
01:51:55,892 --> 01:51:57,985
- Get hold of him.
- Angier!

1452
01:52:02,666 --> 01:52:05,226
Run along now.

1453
01:52:05,301 --> 01:52:07,826
Sir, there's a gentleman waiting.

1454
01:52:24,654 --> 01:52:27,384
- Dear God.
- Hello, Cutter.

1455
01:52:28,358 --> 01:52:30,792
You're still alive.

1456
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:32,725
How is it you're still alive?

1457
01:52:32,796 --> 01:52:35,196
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1458
01:52:38,201 --> 01:52:40,226
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

1459
01:52:40,303 --> 01:52:42,271
Good night, Jess.

1460
01:52:43,506 --> 01:52:45,167
I've seen her before.

1461
01:52:45,241 --> 01:52:47,766
I saw her in court with...

1462
01:52:48,712 --> 01:52:50,339
...Fallon.

1463
01:52:52,449 --> 01:52:55,043
- What have you done?
- She needs looking after.

1464
01:52:55,118 --> 01:52:57,609
She needs her father.

1465
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:00,656
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

1466
01:53:00,724 --> 01:53:05,661
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1467
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:10,566
I am not going to beg you for anything.

1468
01:53:10,633 --> 01:53:13,898
You don't have to. I'm gonna
make sure it is never used again.

1469
01:53:15,038 --> 01:53:18,132
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1470
01:53:20,677 --> 01:53:22,736
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1471
01:53:22,812 --> 01:53:26,578
My theater. It belongs
with the prestige materials.

1472
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,644
John, I tried not to involve you.

1473
01:53:42,599 --> 01:53:44,863
So...

1474
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:49,497
We go alone now.

1475
01:53:49,572 --> 01:53:52,006
Both of us.

1476
01:53:54,811 --> 01:53:58,212
I mean, I don't have
as far to go as you.

1477
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,851
No.

1478
01:54:06,389 --> 01:54:09,449
You were right. I should have
left him to his damn trick.

1479
01:54:11,227 --> 01:54:13,320
I'm sorry.

1480
01:54:14,864 --> 01:54:17,196
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1481
01:54:18,334 --> 01:54:21,064
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1482
01:54:22,172 --> 01:54:25,630
Didn't mean to hurt her, I didn't.

1483
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:31,844
You go live your life in full now,
all right? You live for both of us.

1484
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:42,180
Goodbye.

1485
01:55:27,971 --> 01:55:30,405
Are you watching closely?

1486
01:56:01,771 --> 01:56:03,705
Put it down on the end.

1487
01:56:37,106 --> 01:56:40,872
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1488
01:56:41,945 --> 01:56:44,743
I once told you about a sailor

1489
01:56:44,814 --> 01:56:47,112
who described drowning to me.

1490
01:56:47,183 --> 01:56:49,378
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1491
01:56:50,486 --> 01:56:54,252
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1492
01:57:33,997 --> 01:57:38,161
Alfred Borden, this day,
in the name of the king

1493
01:57:38,234 --> 01:57:40,225
and the High Court of England,

1494
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,134
you will meet your end.

1495
01:57:44,240 --> 01:57:46,265
No one cares about the man in the box.

1496
01:57:51,114 --> 01:57:52,843
Cutter?

1497
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,044
Cutter!

1498
01:58:00,923 --> 01:58:03,187
Do you have anything to say?

1499
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:09,329
Abracadabra.

1500
01:58:45,968 --> 01:58:48,698
A brother? A twin?

1501
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,906
You were Fallon.

1502
01:58:54,410 --> 01:58:57,072
- The whole time?
- No.

1503
01:58:58,114 --> 01:59:00,446
We were both Fallon.

1504
01:59:00,516 --> 01:59:02,416
We were both Borden.

1505
01:59:07,790 --> 01:59:10,759
Were you the one who went into the box?

1506
01:59:10,827 --> 01:59:12,522
Or the one who came back out?

1507
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:16,128
We took turns.

1508
01:59:20,937 --> 01:59:22,996
The trick is where we would swap.

1509
01:59:29,212 --> 01:59:31,112
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

1510
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:33,444
But I told him it was
too simple, too easy.

1511
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:35,639
No.

1512
01:59:37,186 --> 01:59:39,154
Simple, maybe, but not easy.

1513
01:59:39,222 --> 01:59:42,988
There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

1514
01:59:48,664 --> 01:59:51,861
I don't understand,
how it can be bleeding again?

1515
01:59:55,338 --> 01:59:58,136
Wha... What about Olivia and your wife?

1516
01:59:59,142 --> 02:00:01,042
We each loved one of them.

1517
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:07,410
I loved Sarah.

1518
02:00:07,483 --> 02:00:10,008
He loved Olivia.

1519
02:00:10,086 --> 02:00:12,520
We each had half of a full life,

1520
02:00:12,588 --> 02:00:15,580
really, which was enough for us...

1521
02:00:15,658 --> 02:00:16,647
...just.

1522
02:00:19,295 --> 02:00:21,024
But not for them.

1523
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:25,829
See, sacrifice, Robert,

1524
02:00:25,902 --> 02:00:28,632
that's the price of a good trick.

1525
02:00:30,673 --> 02:00:33,233
You wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1526
02:00:36,512 --> 02:00:38,446
I've... I've made sacrifices.

1527
02:00:38,514 --> 02:00:40,482
- No.
- Yes.

1528
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:44,044
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

1529
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:46,884
Yeah, it takes everything.

1530
02:01:06,943 --> 02:01:09,070
No, no, wait, I'm not...

1531
02:01:15,751 --> 02:01:18,379
It took courage.

1532
02:01:20,389 --> 02:01:23,586
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night,

1533
02:01:24,393 --> 02:01:26,827
not knowing...

1534
02:01:26,896 --> 02:01:29,023
...if I'd be the man in the box...

1535
02:01:32,068 --> 02:01:33,330
...or in the prestige.

1536
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:37,696
Do you want to see...

1537
02:01:37,773 --> 02:01:40,071
...what it cost me?

1538
02:01:40,142 --> 02:01:42,906
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1539
02:01:43,813 --> 02:01:46,213
Look. Look.

1540
02:01:47,316 --> 02:01:48,806
I don't care.

1541
02:01:53,522 --> 02:01:57,083
You went halfway around the world.

1542
02:01:57,159 --> 02:01:59,923
You spent a fortune.

1543
02:02:01,998 --> 02:02:04,523
You did terrible things.

1544
02:02:05,534 --> 02:02:08,002
Really terrible things, Robert.

1545
02:02:10,039 --> 02:02:11,529
And all for nothing.

1546
02:02:12,508 --> 02:02:13,702
For nothing?

1547
02:02:13,776 --> 02:02:15,107
Yeah.

1548
02:02:18,781 --> 02:02:21,409
You never understood...

1549
02:02:21,484 --> 02:02:23,475
...why we did this.

1550
02:02:26,589 --> 02:02:29,149
The audience knows the truth.

1551
02:02:30,293 --> 02:02:32,727
The world is simple.

1552
02:02:32,795 --> 02:02:34,524
It's miserable.

1553
02:02:34,597 --> 02:02:38,294
Solid... Solid all the way through.

1554
02:02:40,636 --> 02:02:42,968
But if you could fool them,

1555
02:02:43,039 --> 02:02:45,200
even for a second...

1556
02:02:46,742 --> 02:02:49,142
...then you could make them wonder.

1557
02:02:50,279 --> 02:02:52,474
And then you...

1558
02:02:52,548 --> 02:02:54,778
Then you got to see something

1559
02:02:54,850 --> 02:02:56,511
very special.

1560
02:03:00,823 --> 02:03:03,348
You really don't know.

1561
02:03:06,429 --> 02:03:08,090
It was...

1562
02:03:09,165 --> 02:03:12,134
...it was the look on their faces.

1563
02:03:27,316 --> 02:03:32,151
<i>Every magic trick
consists of three parts, or acts.</i>

1564
02:03:35,591 --> 02:03:39,049
<i>The first part is called "the pledge."</i>

1565
02:03:39,128 --> 02:03:41,892
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary.</i>

1566
02:03:43,032 --> 02:03:45,967
<i>The second act is called "the turn."</i>

1567
02:03:47,436 --> 02:03:50,303
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something</i>

1568
02:03:50,373 --> 02:03:53,240
<i>and makes it into
something extraordinary.</i>

1569
02:03:54,577 --> 02:03:58,479
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet,
because making something disappear</i>

1570
02:03:58,547 --> 02:04:02,643
<i>isn't enough. You have to bring it back.</i>

1571
02:04:37,086 --> 02:04:39,520
<i>Now you're looking for the secret.</i>

1572
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:46,189
<i>But you won't find it, because,
of course, you're not really looking.</i>

1573
02:04:49,298 --> 02:04:52,734
<i>You don't really want to work it out.</i>

1574
02:04:55,538 --> 02:04:57,836
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>
