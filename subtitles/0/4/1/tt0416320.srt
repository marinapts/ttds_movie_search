1
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,440
The man who said,
"I'd rather be lucky than good,"

2
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,720
saw deeply into life.

3
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,720
People are afraid to face how great
a part of life is dependent on luck.

4
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,800
It's scary to think so much
is out of one's control.

5
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,600
There are moments in a match
when the ball hits the top of the net,

6
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,441
and for a split second
it can either go forward or fall back.

7
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,360
With a little luck,
it goes forward and you win.

8
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,840
Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,720
Sorry.

10
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
Mr. Townsend.

11
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,840
Just this way.

12
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,080
So the Beach Club Marbella,
tennis instructor.

13
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,680
Stanford House.
Forte Village, Sardinia. Nice.

14
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Yes. I've had
a good deal of experience.

15
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,320
Yeah, so I see.

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,480
Now, I've heard very good things.
You don't miss playing professionally?

17
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
I thank God every day
I don't have to do it.

18
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,680
I hate the whole tennis tour thing.

19
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,080
Constant traveling, and I was
never going to be Rusedski or Agassi.

20
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,960
You have to really want it.

21
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,920
Not that I have their talent.

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,080
Well, your credentials
and references are excellent.

23
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,000
And you want to live in London?

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
Very much. Very much.

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,440
We have a very
exclusive membership here.

26
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,360
You can begin this weekend?

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,840
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,960
That's your sofa,
which also doubles up as a bed.

29
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,840
Which is great, you know,
'cause you can be watching some telly,

30
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,960
ain't got the hassle
of having to go to a bedroom.

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,400
You can just open it up, get your kip.

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,640
Kitchen just through there.

33
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,120
All your amenities, fixtures,
fittings, washer-dryer...

34
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,440
All that stuff.

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,000
Lovely view, not overlooked.

36
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,000
So it's all good.

37
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,600
This is 225 a week?

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
Well, it's London, mate. Bang, mate.
If you don't like it, move to Leeds.

39
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,240
D'you know what I mean?
You got a wok?

40
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,120
You got a wok? It's one of those
Oriental, sort of conical pans.

41
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,320
- No, no, no.
- The geezer who was in here before,

42
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
he left one in there. You're
welcome to it. I'll throw that in.

43
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,240
- I'll take it.
- That's a good choice.

44
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,800
Very good.

45
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,960
Chris Wilton.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
This is Tom Hewett.

47
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
- Very nice to meet you. How do you do?
- Morning. Pleasure.

48
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,600
I think Chris would be
the perfect instructor for you,

49
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,400
and he's very patient.
Great at analyzing a player's faults.

50
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,640
I'm so out of practice. I mean,
I haven't played since university,

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
and I loved it, but I haven't
picked up a racket in bloody ages, so...

52
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
Don't worry, it comes back.

53
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,280
What you can't do is rush in,
be discouraged.

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
OK.

55
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,800
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

56
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,960
- Over here.
- Brilliant.

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,760
OK, so who was better, or tougher?
Henman or Agassi?

58
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,120
- They were both great.
- Yeah, I know, but I mean,

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,040
you held your own more than admirably.

60
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,520
For a while.

61
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,120
But as the game goes on,
you see how really good they are.

62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,960
- Actually, I'll get this.
- No, no, no, no.

63
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,520
- No, please, Tom, I insist. I insist.
- No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,480
Get your dirty great forehand off.

65
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,880
Thank you. I'll get the next one.

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,760
So, do you need a lift after this?

67
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,400
Actually, I'm looking for a music store.
I want to buy some CDs.

68
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,160
Music around here?
I think there's one on the Fulham Road.

69
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,360
And they'll have a decent opera section?

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,480
Opera? You like opera, really?

71
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,800
I love opera.

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,000
Papa gives loads
to the Royal in Covent Garden.

73
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,960
I know this is gonna sound a bit weird,

74
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,360
but would you like to go
to the opera tomorrow night?

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,440
To the opera?

76
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,960
Yeah. We've got a box
and someone's not coming.

77
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,520
It's La bloody Traviata.

78
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,640
My God. I'd love to.

79
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,560
Are you sure it's not an imposition?
Can I at least pay for my seat?

80
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,240
It's not an imposition,
it'd be an absolute pleasure.

81
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,480
I just like the fact that we both
share a love for opera. Brilliant.

82
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,560
So?

83
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,640
- I said to David and Melissa...
- Evening all. Hello, Mum.

84
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
Hello, sweetie. Very nice to see you.

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
- This is Chris. This is my father Alec.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

86
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,680
I hear you're an
incredible tennis player.

87
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,520
I played once, and then I gave up,
then I went back, then I gave up,

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
- then I went back
- Rubbish.

89
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,520
- I'm sure Tom exaggerated my game.
- I just got bored.

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,640
- Good evening. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

91
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
- This is my sister... Chloe.
- There's a chair somewhere.

92
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,400
- I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you.
- There's two more.

93
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,800
Yeah, well, the olds say thank you
very much for the lovely flowers.

94
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,000
They said it was very thoughtful,
and totally unnecessary.

95
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,440
But off the record, well done, A plus,
'cause they love that sort of thing.

96
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,080
Oh, they're lovely people.
And your sister's very bright.

97
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Frighteningly so at times. But...

98
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Anyway, she thought you were terrific,
and she wanted to invite you

99
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
to our country house
with the parents on Sunday.

100
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,880
'Cause they're having a party,
there'll be some good people.

101
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,280
And I'll play you some great music,
because Dad's got an epic collection.

102
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,520
Chlo-Chlo, do you wanna have
a knock with Chris for a bit?

103
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,440
It's just that
it's 5:00 somewhere, darling,

104
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
and I've some serious
cocktails to start making.

105
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Irish! Have you ever had a
Cuba libre or a caipirinha?

106
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,280
Lt'd be really boring
for Chris to play with me on my own.

107
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,080
It's really boring for him
to play with me, but he's a good sport.

108
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,960
And anyway, you've got better
legs than I've got. Chop-chop.

109
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't be silly. I teach people
who have never held a racket before.

110
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,920
- I'm so bad.
- That's how you get better.

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,840
Playing with a stronger player. Come on.

112
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,640
OK.

113
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,880
Was I dreadful?

114
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,720
Not at all.
You have a very unique style.

115
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,680
Yeah, it's called clumsy.
How did you get to be so good anyway?

116
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,080
Tom says you played
with some of the real greats.

117
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,040
For me, it was a way out
of a poor existence.

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,080
Caught the eye of a good coach.
I don't know.

119
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
It all came so easy at first.

120
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,840
- Do you enjoy teaching?
- Not really.

121
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,840
I mean, it's OK for now,

122
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,640
but I'd cut my throat
if I thought I had to do it forever.

123
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,560
I'd like to do something with my life.

124
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,200
You know, special.
I'd like to make a contribution.

125
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,520
So, you're a poor boy
from Ireland come to London.

126
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,320
I love it.

127
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,800
It's so exciting and alive.

128
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
I've never seen so much art or theater.

129
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,480
Not that I've taken
much advantage of it yet.

130
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,200
Well, look, if you'd like someone
to show you around,

131
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,000
I grew up in Belgravia. I'd be happy
to take you to all the good places.

132
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,320
That'd be great.

133
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
On one condition: I buy the tickets.

134
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,160
Oh, dear, is that going to be an issue?

135
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm afraid it is.
I'm very old-fashioned.

136
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,760
But actually,
I did read something about the...

137
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,120
...exhibition in the Saatchi Gallery.

138
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,080
That's perfect.
It'd be my pleasure to take you.

139
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,320
You're very kind to offer this.

140
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,800
Can I at least give you
some free tennis lessons?

141
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,560
OK, it's a deal.

142
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,040
How about Wednesday for the Saatchi?

143
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,600
I can do that.

144
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,120
- Shall we meet for lunch first?
- It's a date.

145
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,960
I'd better get ready.
Your guests will be arriving soon.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Go.

147
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,160
A sweaty tennis player's
hardly what they expect.

148
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,960
So who's my next victim?

149
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,280
You?

150
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
I haven't played table tennis
in quite a while.

151
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,440
Would you like to play
for a thousand pounds a game?

152
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,880
What did I walk into?

153
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,240
What did I walk into?

154
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
It's like this.

155
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,360
- May I?
- Please.

156
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,600
You have to lean in,
and hit through the ball.

157
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,440
I was doing just fine
until you showed up.

158
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,680
The story of my life.

159
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,200
So, tell me,

160
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,040
what's a beautiful, young,
American Ping-Pong player doing

161
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
mingling amongst
the British upper class?

162
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,520
Did anyone ever tell you,
you play a very aggressive game?

163
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,080
Did anyone ever tell you
you've very sensual lips?

164
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,480
- Extremely aggressive.
- I'm naturally competitive.

165
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Is it off-putting?

166
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll have to think
about that for a while.

167
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,560
There you are.

168
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,680
I wanted to introduce you
to Chris Wilton.

169
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,800
Chris Wilton,
this is Nola Rice, my fiance.

170
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,080
So, you're the tennis pro.

171
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,120
- Hello, darling.
- My pleasure.

172
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,560
He was trying to have
his way with me over the table.

173
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Oh, really? Yeah, well,
you'd better watch out for this one.

174
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,520
He's made a living out of hustling.

175
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,600
I'll be ready for you next time.

176
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,000
- I'll see you outside.
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,080
She's quite something, isn't she?

178
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,280
- How long have you been together?
- Six months.

179
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,480
Jesus, yeah, six months!

180
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,960
She came over to study acting,
and I met her at a party

181
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,120
that I'd crashed
and she'd crashed, and...

182
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,880
...one thing led to another.

183
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Obviously, it's taken Mother quite
a long time to get used to the idea

184
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,240
that I'm serious about her, but...

185
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
To be honest with you,

186
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,680
Mother's always had
this funny little agenda for me

187
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,040
which doesn't really involve
marrying a struggling actress.

188
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,200
Especially an American one.

189
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,160
But I am crazy about her.

190
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,920
Anyway, I think we should all go to
dinner next week. What do you think?

191
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,000
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

192
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,600
Now, Irish, how about a little drop
of Scottish before supper?

193
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,000
- Why not.
- Lead on. Quickly.

194
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,480
These afternoons have been great.

195
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,480
I'm so glad your schedule
allows you so much time off.

196
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,160
Yes, it's fun.

197
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,880
Although it wouldn't hurt
to have a few more pupils.

198
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Do you need money?

199
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
God, no.

200
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,880
No, I'm fine.

201
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,640
It's very sweet of you to ask,
but I don't.

202
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm only asking
because I care about you.

203
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,880
Shall we go to your place or mine?

204
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,200
I don't think mine's
quite what you're used to.

205
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,160
Shut up. I think yours'll be just great.

206
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,480
You've been seeing a lot
of Chris Wilton lately, I understand.

207
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,160
- Yeah. He's very nice.
- I liked him.

208
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,000
I just don't understand
what he's aiming for.

209
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,960
He certainly doesn't want to be
a tennis pro for the rest of his life.

210
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,280
Well, I find him very likeable.

211
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,800
He's fought his way up the only way
open to him, and he's not trivial.

212
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,160
I had a very interesting conversation
the other day about Dostoyevsky.

213
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,200
Can't we do something for him?

214
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,600
A place in one of
your companies or something?

215
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,960
Has he expressed a desire?

216
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,680
No, but... he's open,
you know, about his future.

217
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,000
He really wants
to make something of his life.

218
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,120
Chloe, be careful.

219
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,120
Tom's involved with a woman I have
reservations about. Don't rush off.

220
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,120
Tom's happy with Nola.
You're prejudiced 'cause she's American.

221
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,040
She's spoilt and temperamental.

222
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,960
She's an actress, they're emotional.

223
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,280
She's deluding herself, and she's moody.
She's not right for Tom.

224
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,600
Well, I care very deeply for Chris,
and I think he feels the same way.

225
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,000
- Who are you talking about?
- Nola.

226
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,120
- Have you been waiting ages?
- Hello. Not at all.

227
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,680
Traffic was awful.
The others'll be here in a minute.

228
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,640
They're probably
stuck in it somewhere.

229
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
Can I have a champagne cocktail, please?

230
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,920
One of your father's associates spoke to
me today about the possibility of a job.

231
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,560
Did you say anything?

232
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,040
Look, I just told Papa to keep his
eyes open if anything juicy opened up,

233
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,920
so you could have first option,
if you wanted it.

234
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,680
- You're not cross, are you?
- God, no.

235
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,640
It's extremely thoughtful of you.

236
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Thanks.

237
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,240
What do you think?

238
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm gonna have to think about it.

239
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,200
I've never really seen myself
in the business world.

240
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,040
So, what do you see for yourself,
you know, in the future?

241
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
I don't know, really.

242
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,360
I mean, I'm sure
it's a great opportunity.

243
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,160
I think it is.

244
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,600
Papa said it's a chance
to learn the business.

245
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,320
And if things go well,
he'll see to it, you know, that...

246
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
...you move up quickly, or whatever.

247
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,520
I've always felt so-so
about office work.

248
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,680
It's not exactly office work.

249
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,240
Think of it more as a stepping stone.

250
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,360
To?

251
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,400
To a biggerjob, more responsibility,

252
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
greater earning potential, I don't know.

253
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,520
You've always said how much
you admire Papa's accomplishments.

254
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,800
Of course.

255
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,040
I mean, it's strange,
but coming where I come from,

256
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
I've always admired
men like your father.

257
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,760
Wealthy, but not stuffy.

258
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,880
Enjoying his fortune.

259
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,120
Having a grand time,
supporting the arts.

260
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,560
Well, he'd really like
to open some doors for you, that's all.

261
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,440
He's a very generous man.

262
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
He respects how you've pulled
yourself up, against the odds.

263
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,800
- You don't seem very enthusiastic.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,760
I hope my hesitation isn't upsetting.

265
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,640
No, no, not at all.
It's just that, you know,

266
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,320
you've always talked about
making a contribution and... I'm sorry.

267
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,840
I will. I promise.

268
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,960
- Oh, good.
- Hello.

269
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,280
Hi, guys.

270
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,680
Hello.

271
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,160
Don't worry, the traffic was awful.

272
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,960
It's my fault, I dragged Nola
to the classic car show at ExCeL.

273
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
- Really?
- It was unbelievable.

274
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,880
I swear, my trousers have barely dried.

275
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh, God. Shut up.

276
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,800
You love your cars, don't you, Chris?

277
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,000
- I think the old ones are beautiful.
- Yeah, I like the old ones.

278
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,960
But Tom likes all those new ones
with the gadgets and...

279
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,240
I want an Aston Martin.

280
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,200
- I drove an Aston Martin.
- Really?

281
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,680
Yeah, I used to work for a man,
and I used to wash his cars for him.

282
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,840
- He was very, very particular about
- Thank you.

283
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,880
Taking care of them, so I had to
wash them every day with a toothbrush.

284
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,680
I want an Aston Martin, or one of
those vintage convertible Mercedes.

285
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,920
Well, when we're married
we'll collect vintage cars.

286
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,120
Just as long as I can have a DB9
with all the trimmings. OK?

287
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,800
In fact, Hedley is perfect
for keeping all those cars.

288
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,240
- In fact, speaking of Hedley...
- Should we order, 'cause he's waiting.

289
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,040
Frightfully sorry. I'll have
the baked potato with truffles.

290
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,440
- That'll be lovely. Yum-yum.
- I'd like the same, please.

291
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,480
Nothing to start?

292
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,160
Oh, I think the wine list.

293
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,680
I'll have the caviar blinis, please.

294
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,560
- Roast chicken.
- God, boring!

295
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,240
Honestly, they have the
greatest caviar blinis here.

296
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,040
- You should try them.
- That's OK.

297
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,040
- No, do you like caviar?
- So-so.

298
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,640
"So-so."

299
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,680
He's been brought up as a good boy, to
always order modestly. I'm very sorry.

300
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,640
He'll have the blinis.

301
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,440
My goodness, was your father an oil
rigger who specialized in etiquette?

302
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,480
He was kind of austere.

303
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,680
Chris's dad was a bit
of a religious fanatic.

304
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Oh, Christ.

305
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,760
After he lost both his legs,
he found Jesus.

306
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,240
God. Sorry, but itjust
doesn't seem like a fair trade.

307
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
What were you saying about Hedley?

308
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,360
- Papa's invited us for some shooting.
- Oh, really?

309
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,280
I'd better bring
a different change of clothes.

310
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,960
I don't think your mother
appreciated what I brought last time.

311
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,800
I think that was your swimsuit.
She's used to slightly more fabric.

312
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,680
I'm sure if she knew you'd worn it
in a movie, she'd suddenly find it chic.

313
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,320
- True.
- Have you done many movies?

314
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,000
It was a commercial, not a movie.

315
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,880
But your eyes went straight to her,
if you know what I mean.

316
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,640
I don't think my career has...
really gone as planned.

317
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,120
Oh, you just need a break.

318
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,320
I think it's important
to be lucky in anything.

319
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,520
Well, I don't believe in luck.
I believe in hard work.

320
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,360
Oh, hard work is mandatory,

321
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,680
but I think everybody's afraid
to admit what a big part luck plays.

322
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,960
I mean, it seems scientists are...

323
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,880
...confirming more and more that
all existence is here by blind chance.

324
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,880
No purpose, no design.

325
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,600
Well, I don't care,
I love every minute of it.

326
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,560
And I envy you for it.

327
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,640
What was it the...
the vicar used to say?

328
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,360
"Despair is the path
of least resistance."

329
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,840
It was something odd, wasn't it?
It was very strange...

330
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,200
I think that faith
is the path of least resistance.

331
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,560
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

332
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,280
Can we change the subject, please?

333
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,640
Nola was talking about acting,
which is much more interesting.

334
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,360
No, I was...

335
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,040
...just saying that I think
I'm giving acting a second thought.

336
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,560
I just can't bear people
in my hometown to think I've failed.

337
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,280
Not that I'm ever
going back to Colorado.

338
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,640
Ever.

339
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,200
Have you decided on a wine?

340
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,240
Two bottles of Puligny-Montrachet.
Thank you.

341
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:09,720
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

342
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,400
- Good morning. Chris Wilton.
- Rod Carver.

343
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,680
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

344
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,280
You'll be working
under Alan Sinclair here.

345
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,600
Hi, Alan. How are you?

346
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,280
At first, you may find the
assignments a little unchallenging,

347
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,520
but that'll soon change as you
appreciate how things wash here.

348
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,560
- It's basically nine to five.
- Yes, yes.

349
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,320
So you'll have plenty of time
to keep up the backhand, if you like.

350
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,120
Now, if you're OK with the package,

351
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,360
we'd like to begin
the first of the month.

352
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,240
I'm sure the salary won't be a problem.

353
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,360
- Good to meet you, Alan.
- Good. And you.

354
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,400
And Rod.

355
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,680
- I'm sure you'll be happy here.
- I'm sure I will.

356
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,120
- Exciting things are happening.
- OK.

357
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
I can't tell you how happy I am
you've taken thatjob.

358
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,960
It's such good news.

359
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,680
Here, I brought you this to celebrate.

360
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,200
Wow. Thank you.

361
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,760
Believe me, in no time
you'll be running that division.

362
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,640
You're so much more on the ball
than Alan Sinclair. He's nice, but...

363
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,360
...uninspiring.
- It's very rare.

364
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,400
It has some beautiful arias on it.

365
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,200
And his voice expresses

366
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,600
everything that's tragic about life.

367
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,360
- You find it tragic, do you?
- And you?

368
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,120
I love it.

369
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,360
Let's stay at home and have dinner,
and listen to the tragedy.

370
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm gonna open one of those
bottles of wine I got you.

371
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,560
Puligny-Montrachet.

372
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,960
I never heard of it
before Tom ordered it.

373
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,360
Now I'm addicted.

374
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,160
Tom and Nola invited us
to go and see a film with them tonight,

375
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,920
but I told them we're busy.

376
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
But we have no plans.

377
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,680
Well, no special plans.

378
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I thought we said we'd stay in?

379
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,240
Yeah, but it wasn't written in stone.

380
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,920
We could've joined them.

381
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,440
We still can, if you'd prefer it.

382
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,880
It's... it's not a case
of preferring it, it's just...

383
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,960
...we always have fun with them,
and you love films.

384
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,320
Well, shall I call them?

385
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,040
I mean, sure, unless you'd rather not.

386
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Well...

387
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,360
It might be more fun,
just the two of us.

388
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,920
The wine, the opera.

389
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,000
Absolutely.

390
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,360
I just figured...

391
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,000
We can stay in any... any night, and...

392
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,080
...they're free and suggested a film.

393
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,480
What's the film?

394
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,200
I don't know, but if you'd prefer it.

395
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,160
I am in the mood for a film.

396
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Thank you so much, fella.

397
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,560
Hello. Oh, hang on, I'm having problems
with the door. There we go.

398
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,800
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hi, guys. One second.

399
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
There you go, fella. Thanks so much.

400
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,880
- Good luck with the Sky Blues.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

401
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,920
Where is she?

402
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,480
Nola got a migraine at the last moment,
and unfortunately she can't make it.

403
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,640
- Oh, no. Is she gonna be all right?
- But she sends her love.

404
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,280
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

405
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,480
- Hell with her, Motorcycle Diaries!
- I bet that was her choice.

406
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,040
I can't believe this is
what you really want to see.

407
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,880
Everybody likes you at work.

408
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,520
Papa says he's heard great things.

409
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,280
You're a very clever boy.

410
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,600
Hey!

411
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,320
Hey.

412
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,000
- Hi.
- How are you?

413
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,720
- What are you doing here?
- I was just looking for a sweater.

414
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,600
The kind Tom has. Is it cashmere?

415
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,080
It's vicua.

416
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,600
- Vicua.
- Vicua?

417
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,920
- Yeah.
- Right.

418
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,040
Where are you going?

419
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,800
Oh, I'm just
having a nervous breakdown.

420
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
- Why?
- So...

421
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,400
Well, I have an audition
in ten minutes and...

422
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,040
As usual, my confidence level, which
started off at a ten, is now at a zero.

423
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,760
- Don't worry, you'll be great.
- Yeah. I'm gonna be late, so...

424
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,280
- Are you walk? You wanna walk?
- Yeah, sure.

425
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,800
My agent was supposed
to meet me, but he canceled.

426
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,160
So that's... awful.
I'm alone to...

427
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,280
Would you like me to come along
for moral support?

428
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,960
- Yes. That would be great. If you...
- Sure.

429
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,120
- If it's not a problem.
- It's not a problem.

430
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,600
- No, it's not a problem.
- OK.

431
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
I used to get really tense
before big tennis matches.

432
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,560
Have you ever tried yoga?

433
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,320
- No.
- No?

434
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,560
Hi.

435
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,600
- Hello. Hi.
- Oh, hey.

436
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,480
- How was it?
- Blew that.

437
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,760
Itjust works, you know, at home, but...

438
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,440
I don't know,
I just can never really pull through...

439
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,760
...in the end.
- You will. You will.

440
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,160
Yeah.

441
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,400
You know what,

442
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,360
I could actually use a drink
just to pull myself together...

443
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,880
...a little bit.
- Sure.

444
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,920
- OK.
- This way.

445
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
What was I saying?

446
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,160
My sister went to college
for a couple of years.

447
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,920
But I'm like you, I'm self-taught.

448
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,320
You should see my sister, she's...

449
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,560
...she's very beautiful,
but she's lost in drugs and...

450
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm sure she's not
more beautiful than you are.

451
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,040
What I am is sexy. But Linda's...

452
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,880
My sister...

453
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,720
...is classically beautiful.

454
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,840
So, you are aware
of your effect on men?

455
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,800
Before my parents split,
they used to put her in these pageants.

456
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,480
It's just a joke.

457
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,080
What did your father do?

458
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,880
He... left.

459
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,520
And never sent any money.

460
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,960
And my mother
could never hold down a job.

461
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,760
- No?
- No.

462
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,200
Her problem was that she drank.

463
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
How did you meet Tom?

464
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,680
We met at a party.

465
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,960
He...

466
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,760
...saw me across the room

467
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,080
and he honed in on me,
like a guided missile.

468
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
And I...

469
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,480
I liked him right off, you know.

470
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,360
I thought...

471
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,360
Well, I think he's very handsome.

472
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,680
Don't you?

473
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
Very.

474
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,920
And he asked you to marry him?

475
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,200
Well, he...

476
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,080
...swept me off of my feet
with presents and, you know...

477
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,080
What did I know
about that kind of life?

478
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,280
I'm just a starving actress
from Boulder, Colorado.

479
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,800
But...

480
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,320
I had another bad marriage behind me.
That's another reason she hates me.

481
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,160
- Who?
- Eleanor. Tom's mother.

482
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,640
She wants him
to marry this girl named Olivia,

483
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,680
who I think is a distant cousin.
I don't know. It's... it's sick.

484
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,200
It's such an inbred family. It's...

485
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,640
And was it love at first sight
for you too?

486
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
I thought he was very handsome.

487
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,640
You know, and I told you I was just...

488
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,160
I was overwhelmed with attention.

489
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,440
So, what about you and Chloe?

490
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
She's very sweet.

491
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
She is very sweet.

492
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,800
And she wants to marry you.

493
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,480
I don't think her mother
would approve of that either.

494
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,760
No. No, it's different.

495
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,280
I don't buy into Eleanor,
and she knows it, but you...

496
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
...are being groomed.

497
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,080
You mark my words.

498
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,520
They almost died when they thought
that Chloe had run off with some...

499
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,240
...guy that ran a gastropub in the city.

500
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,800
But...

501
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,960
You're gonna do very well
for yourself, unless you blow it.

502
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,160
And how am I going to blow it?

503
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,160
By making a pass at me.

504
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,720
And what makes you think
that's gonna happen?

505
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,320
Men always seem to wonder.

506
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,440
They think I'd be
something very special.

507
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,480
And are you?

508
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,480
Well, no one's ever
asked for their money back.

509
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,000
Where was all this confidence
when you needed it in the audition?

510
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,800
I've had too much to drink.

511
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,280
Can you get me a cab?

512
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Sure.

513
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,600
Thank you.

514
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,680
You were driving a bit fast,

515
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,240
- weren't you?
- Good morning.

516
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,200
- Which one is he in?
- Second one over there.

517
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,240
Oh, hi.

518
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
So, do you think
he's gonna be all right?

519
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,640
Carmichael came and had a look at him
the other week.

520
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,120
Oh, he's so sweet.

521
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,120
The problem with the right hind
is gonna...

522
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,160
It should have dissipated fully already.

523
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,480
- Tom, can I feed him?
- Yeah, yeah, wack him some hay.

524
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,120
Tom, do you think he's
gonna be able to play on Sunday?

525
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,080
Well, he will play on Sunday,
but it's just the problem with the fact

526
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,880
that it's only Lopez who can ride him,
and he's injured at the moment.

527
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,800
We're having a bloody nightmare
with injuries.

528
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
You're so beautiful.

529
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,200
What would you say to the idea
of taking a business course at school

530
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,560
that the company would pay for?

531
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,200
I don't know.

532
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,960
I've had very good
feedback on your work.

533
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,120
And the beginning of next year

534
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,120
there's going to be a very
significant position opening up.

535
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,120
One that carries a great deal
of responsibility and pays accordingly.

536
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,000
Plus, there are a number of perks...

537
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,120
Expense account, driver, et cetera.

538
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,720
We had been focusing on someone else...

539
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,160
...but it's obvious to me
that you and Chloe have become close.

540
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,600
Although I wouldn't consider it,
if I didn't think you were qualified.

541
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,240
I'd hate to disappoint you.

542
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,040
- Oh, excuse me.
- Come on, Chris...

543
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,080
We're nearly ready.

544
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,560
- I'll bring a gun for Chris.
- Thanks, Tom.

545
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,520
Never mind, fella.

546
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,200
This is basically a tune-up for the
grouse season, which is starting soon.

547
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,160
- But it's bloody good fun.
- Don't frighten him.

548
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,680
His shooting's not really up
to his tennis, poor thing.

549
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,720
I'll make an accomplished
grouse shooter of him yet.

550
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
- Don't you worry, Chris.
- Quite right, Papa.

551
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,000
Come on, Chloe.

552
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,840
Hi, darling.

553
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,520
Have you seen my Strindberg book?

554
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,920
No.

555
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
How did your audition go?

556
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,120
Oh, it was pretty awful, I'm afraid.

557
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,040
It's her own fault, bless her.
She just tightens up.

558
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,960
Well, I'm sure something
worthwhile will come along.

559
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,480
Unfortunately, there's just not anything
right now that I'm that great for.

560
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,800
So, how long do you keep it up?

561
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,680
How long?

562
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,040
Well, if time passes
and nothing significant materializes,

563
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,640
how long do you keep on going
before you decide that?

564
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,400
To try something else?

565
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,120
I hardly think Nola's
reached that point, Mother.

566
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I'm not saying that.

567
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,960
All I'm saying is
you give acting a try for a time,

568
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,760
and if you keep being disappointed
you have to ask yourself the question,

569
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,960
"Is this really what I want in my life?
Is this what I want?"

570
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,280
Well, I do ask myself that.

571
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,480
See? It's only logical, Tom.

572
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,840
Especially for a woman.

573
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,760
It's a particularly
cruel business for a woman,

574
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,560
and as you get older and time passes,

575
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,880
if nothing happens
it gets harder and harder.

576
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,480
Eleanor,
Nola isn't exactly over the hill.

577
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm not saying now.

578
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,160
But I'm a great one
for facing up to realities.

579
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,240
Your take on these realities
is your own opinion and nothing else.

580
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
Frankly, not everybody else
is interested in hearing about it.

581
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,040
Tom, don't raise your voice
to your mother, please.

582
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,160
I'm not raising my voice.
And I'm sorry, Papa,

583
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,160
but she's always on Nola's case,
continually discouraging her via...

584
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,600
...innuendos.

585
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,320
All I'm saying is acting's
so will-o'-the-wisp.

586
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,440
Those that have it, know it right off.

587
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,040
To pursue it because
you don't want to admit defeat

588
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,960
to friends back home is,
frankly, unrealistic.

589
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
I'm sorry, but that's the way I feel.

590
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,960
Excuse me.

591
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Nola.

592
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,880
It's OK. I'd like to be alone, thanks.

593
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,880
Well, thank you very much. And I'm
sorry if I'm raising my voice now,

594
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,160
but you know that's her
Achilles heel, emotionally.

595
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,760
He's right, Eleanor. I think
you've had one too many G and T's.

596
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,080
I was looking for you.

597
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,240
I was upset.
I just wanted to be alone.

598
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,280
I don't mean to intrude.

599
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,440
I need a drink.

600
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,280
I like you when you drink.
You get flirtatious.

601
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,320
- Do I?
- Yeah.

602
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,760
- Confident.
- I don't think this was a good idea.

603
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,440
You shouldn't have followed me here.

604
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Do you feel guilty?

605
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Do you?

606
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
We can't do this.

607
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,440
I know.

608
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,640
This can't lead anyplace.

609
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Hello.

610
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,560
Darling, I think it's for you.

611
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,440
But take it outside.

612
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,080
Well, there's hope, at least.

613
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,320
When's the callback?

614
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,560
Just let me know
when you hear anything at all,

615
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,840
'cause I really think
I could be great in this part.

616
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,720
Yeah. OK.

617
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,880
Bye.

618
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
Why have you been so cold to me?

619
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,440
- I haven't been cold.
- Yes, you have.

620
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,680
Ever since we came back
from the countryside

621
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,160
you've been distant, evasive.

622
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,360
I don't want to encourage anything.

623
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,760
What happened, happened, Chris.

624
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,800
I mean... The moment was very
out of control for many reasons.

625
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,560
I was upset, I was drinking,
and the storm was overpowering.

626
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,360
- Oh, stop rationalizing.
- I'm not rationalizing.

627
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,480
Passions are passions, but we're
both very involved with other people.

628
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,840
You're not such a good actress,
you know. It's not possible.

629
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,560
Look, you daydreamed
about making love to me,

630
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,440
and I'm not saying the fantasy
didn't cross my mind, OK?

631
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,800
We had our moment.

632
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,360
But, you know, let's move on,
get back to reality.

633
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,680
Chris, we're gonna be
brother and sister-in-law.

634
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,720
You were exactly
as I pictured you'd be making love.

635
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,040
Chris, forget it. It's over.

636
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,680
Thanks. Henry!

637
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,400
- Hey. How are you?
- Chris. All right.

638
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,000
- Look at you.
- Good to see you.

639
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,360
Looks like you're doing
all right for yourself, aren't you?

640
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,160
- Thanks.
- You still doing the tennis tour?

641
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,960
Yeah, I love it. I love it.
Look at this car.

642
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,400
Oh, don't worry, it's not mine.
It's the company's.

643
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,080
Yeah, I know you found it
a bit of a grind, didn't you?

644
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,880
But I'm still circling the globe,
deluding myself.

645
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,680
I just couldn't stand it.

646
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,080
No. No, I heard you went into business.

647
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,360
I'm a wheel in an office,
if you can believe it.

648
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,880
- A big wheel.
- It's who you know, Henry.

649
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,480
I got involved with a woman.
Very nice.

650
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,160
Family's got nothing but money.

651
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,400
Big estate, servants, polo ponies.
All quite lovely.

652
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,560
Hey, look, I understand.

653
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,320
It beats getting your heart broken
all the time by the top seeds.

654
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,920
Isn't it amazing how much of life
turns on whether the ball

655
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,480
goes over the net
or comes right back at you?

656
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,480
I always admired
your game though, you know?

657
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,960
- Thanks.
- You were very steady.

658
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,640
Cool under pressure, but creative.

659
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,880
You could be a poet
with the racket like Laver was.

660
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,360
I lost to you as much as I beat you.

661
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,240
No. When I played you,
you never beat yourself.

662
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
I'm telling you, a couple
of bounces the other way,

663
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,680
you might've beaten
some of those top seeds.

664
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,040
Listen, can I buy you lunch?

665
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,800
That's...
What about next time I'm in town?

666
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,560
- Give me your number.
- Certainly.

667
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,640
I'm moving into a new flat,
so this is my business card.

668
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,040
- You should call me anytime.
- Very impressive.

669
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,280
So good to see you, Henry.

670
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,720
- You look well.
- And you, mate.

671
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,160
- You look very, very well.
- I can buy us lunch.

672
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,280
- Put it on the expense account, so...
- Very well.

673
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,440
...do call.
- Very good. Yeah, yeah.

674
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,360
- All right.
- Bye.

675
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,800
- Oh, my God.
- Right there.

676
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,120
- She's got glasses on.
- But why on earth?

677
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,200
Why on earth would
your mother invite her here?

678
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,800
She met her at the supermarket
yesterday and invited her...

679
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
- The supermarket?
- Yes.

680
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,200
- Can you play the piano?
- No, I'm terrible at the piano.

681
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,320
- So, when are you two getting married?
- Mummy!

682
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,360
- Oh, gosh, Eleanor!
- Oh, don't look so surprised.

683
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,400
Stop it.

684
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,560
You've been like two peas
in a pod for a long time now.

685
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,400
Don't tell me the subject
hasn't come up.

686
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,720
- Mummy, come with me.
- Oh, dear.

687
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,200
You need a strong cup of coffee.
Come on.

688
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,560
Eleanor doesn't hold back
when she's had a few.

689
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,680
Look, it's a reasonable question.
Chloe and I have discussed it.

690
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,000
Eleanor and I would be delighted
to welcome you to the family.

691
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,480
Tom would love
having you as a brother-in-law,

692
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,640
and whatever you two need,
you can always rely on us.

693
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,040
I appreciate that.

694
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,680
Darling, one second.
I just think we...

695
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,400
You two have met, haven't you?
I'm sure you've met.

696
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,600
I'm sorry. Who'd have thought?

697
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,640
What, that we were
hiding in the pantry?

698
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,080
It was all her fault, you know.

699
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,920
Like, how can I help it if she
gets turned on by sexual intimacy

700
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
in places that we know
we're gonna get caught?

701
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,480
You were... You!
The risky business was your idea.

702
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,600
All men who see you want to attack you.

703
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,880
Isn't that right, Christopher?

704
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,520
Oh, God, are you all right?

705
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,920
I'm fine.

706
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,360
I shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

707
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,320
I now pronounce you man and wife.

708
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,440
You may kiss the bride.

709
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Oh, my God.

710
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,720
- This is incredible.
- Isn't it?

711
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,760
- What's up here?
- That's the bedroom.

712
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,800
There's another bedroom through there.

713
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,840
The bathroom and a kitchen.

714
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,960
- Little terrace.
- Wow.

715
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,080
- But look at this view.
- Oh, it's breathtaking.

716
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,800
- I just... wish I could afford it.
- Oh, don't bring that up again.

717
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,840
You know it gives Papa pleasure to help.

718
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,680
Come on.
The light coming through every day.

719
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,920
It's beautiful. But it's huge!

720
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I'm gonna get lost in here or something.

721
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,200
- Did I tell you I'm scared of heights?
- Really?

722
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,280
- Yeah.
- That could be a problem.

723
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,360
I want you to make me pregnant.

724
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,760
Chloe... We discussed this.

725
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,720
It's very quick.

726
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,880
It's not quick, we've been
sleeping together for ages.

727
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,600
And I want three children,
and I want them when I'm young.

728
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,720
Come on, you can do it,
you've got a powerful serve.

729
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,160
Hey! Where are you?

730
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,480
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

731
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,240
Not good.

732
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,200
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

733
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,400
What?

734
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,880
Well, Nola and I...

735
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,760
...broke up.

736
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,000
- No!
- Yeah.

737
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,360
Or, I should say, I called it off.

738
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,040
I thought you were gonna get married.

739
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,280
Yeah, well,
it's rather embarrassing to say

740
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,920
but I think Mother rather
poisoned the well on that one.

741
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,120
Not that I have any intention
in marrying Olivia sodding Allred,

742
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,840
who's her main candidate.

743
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,760
God, no.

744
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,680
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

745
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,160
I suppose the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

746
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,640
so help me God,
part of the situation is, is that...

747
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,640
...l've met someone else.

748
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,760
- No!
- Yeah.

749
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,040
I met someone and I fell in love,
and I just knew right away.

750
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,480
Although the fact that my mother
is in seventh heaven about her,

751
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,840
I keep trying to tell myself
isn't a factor, but...

752
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,880
You know what I mean.

753
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,360
The number you are calling
is not available.

754
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,680
The number you are calling
is not available.

755
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,080
Excuse me.

756
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,600
- Are you looking for Miss Rice?
- Yes.

757
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,440
She's gone. Saw her yesterday.
She's given up the apartment.

758
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,000
- Did she say where?
- Not to me.

759
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,840
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

760
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,720
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

761
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,560
Just business.

762
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,680
You know it's been over a week
since we made love.

763
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,240
Oh, Chloe, I'm beat.

764
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,440
- Am I being rejected?
- Of course not.

765
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,560
OK, I can take a hint.

766
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,240
Meanwhile, I don't know what's wrong.
All my cousins get pregnant so easily.

767
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,720
Look...

768
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,120
...it'll happen.

769
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,640
I'm just really tired.

770
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,080
Kiss.

771
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,560
Sweet dreams.

772
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,800
I now pronounce you man and wife.

773
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,000
You may kiss the bride.

774
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,160
Just in time.
I'm almost starting to show.

775
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,200
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

776
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,160
Well, you have
to see a fertility doctor.

777
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,400
I know.

778
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,760
- We've tried everything.
- What about this?

779
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,840
His brushstrokes are really intense,
aren't they?

780
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,920
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- No.

781
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,440
- Would you ever consider adopting?
- No, absolutely not.

782
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,480
I want my own children.

783
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,360
This one?

784
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,760
Sort of...

785
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,280
Did I tell you Victoria Phyfe
is pregnant?

786
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,520
Really?

787
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,520
- She's so happy.
- Whoa.

788
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,600
Her and her husband
just found each other.

789
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,640
All their neuroses
intertwine so perfectly,

790
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,720
and itjust works like a charm.

791
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,000
After all their unhappy relationships,
they met during a traffic accident.

792
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,840
- God...
- I know, it's great.

793
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,920
Well, our lawyers
are going over it as we speak.

794
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,560
You'll have a daft by Friday. I promise.

795
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,720
If I have to work all night.

796
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,800
OK.

797
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,000
Thank you. Thanks.

798
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,760
Samantha,
can I have two aspirin, please?

799
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,880
Thanks.

800
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,440
Are you OK, sir?

801
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,320
Tell me, Samantha,
do you ever feel claustrophobic in here?

802
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,080
No, not really.

803
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,640
Oh, Christ!

804
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,720
I've got to meet my wife
at the Tate Modern.

805
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,800
There's a new painter
she wants to show me.

806
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,160
If they call back, Samantha,
tell them Friday.

807
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,760
Not before.

808
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,600
Good night.

809
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,840
- Chris.
- Oh, I was looking for you.

810
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,720
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Chris.

811
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,280
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

812
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,600
They've got the most
amazing new artists here.

813
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,680
Yeah?

814
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,520
I want you to see
this woman from St. Ives.

815
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,480
- Oh, yes.
- Look, where are you going to be?

816
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,560
Why?

817
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,520
I have to make a phone call,
and I can't get any reception down here.

818
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,280
Well, we'll be over there.
But hurry, 'cause they're closing soon.

819
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,360
I'm coming.

820
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,000
- OK.
- OK.

821
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,280
Hello.

822
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,520
What a surprise.

823
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,920
I...

824
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,760
- I moved back into town.
- I didn't know you'd left town.

825
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,520
Yeah, I was really upset
about everything that happened,

826
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,200
so I just went back to America
to look for a job.

827
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,520
- I thought you hated that place?
- Anyplace but here.

828
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,760
I looked for you.

829
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,720
For what?

830
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,840
You're still so angry.

831
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,840
Where are you living?

832
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,200
In town. Why?

833
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,160
You live alone?

834
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,760
Why are you asking me these questions,
aren't you still married?

835
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,240
Can I meet you for a drink?

836
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,160
Talk?

837
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,600
Where can I reach you? Come on.

838
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,840
- My goodness. Hello.
- Hi, darling.

839
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,960
Look who I bumped into.

840
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

841
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,840
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

842
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,200
- You look great.
- Thanks.

843
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,960
- How's Tom?
- He's fine.

844
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,160
- Really well.
- Yeah, I heard he got married.

845
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,840
Yeah. They've got a baby.

846
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,040
You know Tom, all settled down.

847
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,720
- OK, I think I've found it.
- Do you two know each other?

848
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,120
This is my friend Carol.
This is Nola.

849
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

850
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,000
We've been looking everywhere
for this video installation.

851
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,160
We can't find it at all.
Will you excuse us?

852
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,560
I think it's
on the third floor, isn't it?

853
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,400
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think it's back there.

854
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,880
Say your phone number.

855
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,320
- What's the point?
- Just say your phone number.

856
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,040
- Chris...
- Please.

857
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,200
Say your phone number.

858
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,400
02079460996.

859
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,360
I'll call you.

860
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,640
Bye.

861
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,200
I think he really knows
what he's doing.

862
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,200
Didn't you get
a good feeling about him?

863
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,960
To me, fertility doctors
are a cut above witch doctors.

864
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,160
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's not like that last one.

865
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
It's OK, John.

866
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,400
I feel like it's gonna happen this time.

867
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,200
You go ahead, I've got a few meetings.

868
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,800
- I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK. It's nearby. I'll walk.

869
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,040
- OK.
- See you at home.

870
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
Bye.

871
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,720
You have a very charming flat.

872
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,600
The area's not as run-down
as you said it was.

873
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,480
I was lucky to find it
on such short notice.

874
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,320
I mean, it's not perfect.

875
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,360
The building's been burglarized
a couple of times and the...

876
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,520
...woman down the hall has mice, but...

877
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,400
...you know, the lobby's decent.

878
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,400
The key word is it's cheap.

879
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,320
What time is it?

880
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,520
Time for you to go.

881
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,080
It's so hard to leave you.

882
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,360
Beautiful woman.

883
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,080
How'd you sleep?

884
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,600
Good.

885
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,440
God, did you see that stuff
on the news last night

886
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,520
about that earthquake in China?

887
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,120
Terrible.

888
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,200
And there was this whole thing
about how they've discovered

889
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,200
- an entirely new planet.
- Yeah?

890
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,680
Yeah.

891
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,440
I went looking for space to rent
for the new gallery yesterday.

892
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,880
Papa's getting so into the idea.

893
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,120
It should be good for you.

894
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,480
- I've got to go to work.
- Oh, really?

895
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,800
I was kind of hoping we might,
you know...

896
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
...before you went to work.

897
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,000
It's my time of the month,
and remember the doctor said

898
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,520
we really should try and do it as often
as we possibly can in the morning.

899
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,520
- Darling, I'm gonna be late.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

900
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,240
Wait, I've got
to take my temperature first.

901
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,560
So, you wanna meet
the same time next week?

902
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,080
Let me come up.

903
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,040
We just spent an hour at the hotel.
Don't tell me that you...

904
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,480
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You drive me crazy.

905
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,000
- You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

906
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,560
Come on.

907
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,040
- Oh, Mrs. Eastby, hello.
- Oh, hello.

908
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,480
Hey, did you get that pest control?

909
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,720
Oh, yes. Yes.

910
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,240
The traps work better
with a little peanut butter.

911
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,760
It's much better than cheese,

912
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,160
despite the popular notion
that cheese is best.

913
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,640
- Oh, this is Mr. Harris.
- Good afternoon. How are you?

914
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,200
- Hello.
- Hello. Good to meet you.

915
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,480
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

916
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,520
Bye.

917
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,840
But I think that Bruton Street
would be perfect for the gallery

918
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,960
because it's just right
in the thick of things and...

919
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,520
It'll just be a natural success,
I think,

920
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,960
because you're great at picking out
paintings and bric-a-brac.

921
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,280
Yeah.

922
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,960
Knowing my luck,
I'll get pregnant the minute it opens.

923
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,960
Yeah, well, you can manage both.
I mean...

924
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,400
Heths didn't have a problem

925
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,400
giving up Adair,
when we first had Rosie.

926
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,440
Remember,
we did have a lot of help though.

927
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,680
But the nanny left us.
She got a part in a movie.

928
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,920
- No.
- Yeah.

929
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,720
Actually, you know who we
bumped into the other day?

930
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,720
- Obviously you know, but... Nola.
- Yeah.

931
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,400
Well, I told you, we saw her.
When was it? Ages ago now.

932
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,160
Yeah. Well, I think she's now working
in a boutique on Ledbury Road.

933
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,360
I think it's Paul and Joe's
or something.

934
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,800
But she's just such an odd girl.

935
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,720
I mean, she still looks great.
Sorry, but it's true.

936
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,600
But something's just...

937
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,360
...changed in her face.
I mean, I... We barely spoke.

938
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,960
Tom said she looked a bit hard.

939
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,200
Yeah, well, she's always, you know,
been a lady of the sauce, so to speak.

940
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,040
And I think it kind of
runs in the family,

941
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,240
but, I don't know...

942
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,600
I mean she's still got
that "come-hither" look.

943
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,760
- Is she going out with anyone?
- Strangely, I forgot to ask.

944
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,880
But I'll keep you in touch with that,
Chloe, let you know.

945
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,200
- Hello, Tom.
- Hello.

946
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,120
- Hello, fella.
- What are you doing here?

947
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,040
We just popped in for a bit of,
you know, local tagliatelle.

948
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,200
Good to see you.
What a lovely family gathering.

949
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,640
You should have told us.
We'd have made a sextet.

950
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,680
A sextet.
We could have had one of those.

951
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,840
- You guys going to Hedley next month?
- Yeah, we're gonna try. Aren't we?

952
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,240
I know Tom's dying to get away.

953
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,880
I was yelling at you the other day.
You didn't hear me.

954
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,960
Me?

955
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,120
Yeah, you were hailing a cab
on Melcombe Street about, what, 5:00.

956
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,280
- I'd have given you a lift.
- I was?

957
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,120
- Where's Melcombe Street?
- No, not me.

958
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,360
Yes, I mean it
certainly looked like you.

959
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,480
- Where is Melcombe Street?
- No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

960
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,960
But people are always
taking me for other people. So...

961
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,160
I'd have sworn it was you.

962
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,360
Well, it certainly
wouldn't be Chris hailing a cab.

963
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,320
He's completely dependant on our driver.

964
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,640
- Quite right.
- Very annoying.

965
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,480
You should check for early Alzheimer's.
You're forgetting. I'm sure I'm right.

966
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,720
No, you are mistaken.
But thank you for thinking of me.

967
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,320
I think the only thing that comes out of
this conversation is you're both nuts.

968
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,600
- Well, you're an authority on that.
- Or drunk. How dare you?

969
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,040
Look, we'd better be going on.
Look, call me.

970
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,480
- I will do.
- Enjoy your supper.

971
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,680
- Bye. See you.
- Thanks.

972
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,720
Nuts.

973
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,440
Good afternoon, Ingrid.

974
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,360
Samantha, what do we have
for this afternoon?

975
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,640
Just the Sarazin people at two.

976
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,840
- Can we push it an hour?
- Yeah.

977
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,160
I should be back in time, but if I'm
not, please make them comfortable.

978
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,880
Chris. Where are you off to?

979
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,040
I'm sorry, Rod,
I've got an appointment.

980
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,280
We have Sarazin
and company this afternoon.

981
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,280
I should be back in time but if I'm not,
please start without me.

982
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,240
- Really?
- It's OK. It's important, trust me.

983
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,080
It's ridiculous to go back to my place.

984
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,000
Once we get there,
you'll have less than an hour.

985
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,560
Look, it's not that I'm
miserable with Chloe, it's just...

986
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,120
I don't wanna talk about Chloe anymore!

987
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,320
Listen, it's just I'm bored!
I mean, she's very nice, but...

988
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,280
- Chris!
- Are you in a bad mood?

989
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,760
Yes, I am in a bad mood.
I just blew another audition.

990
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,200
I'm so sick of this acting thing,
it's just not working out.

991
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,320
It's a hard field.

992
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,880
- You have to keep plugging at it.
- I'm sick of plugging.

993
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,800
Tom's mother was right.
Itjust gets to a point, you know?

994
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,640
Or should I say your mother-in-law?

995
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,680
Hey, look.
Let's not go into one of those, OK?

996
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,800
I don't know what I'm doing with you.
You're never gonna leave Chloe.

997
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,520
Maybe I will.

998
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,000
Don't say that unless you mean it.

999
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,120
Chloe's just so desperate
to get pregnant.

1000
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,240
I mean, it's... mechanical.

1001
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,640
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't see you.

1002
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,960
Really. I mean it.

1003
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,480
- Merry bloody Christmas.
- Lovely.

1004
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,240
How many cigarettes
are you gonna smoke today?

1005
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,520
- A million, at least.
- Please don't start smoking.

1006
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,440
- Well, it is Christmas.
- It's such a pity.

1007
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,680
- Come on, just a little one.
- It's gonna...

1008
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,200
You think you're going
to be living forever, you're not.

1009
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,920
Hi.

1010
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,320
I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas.

1011
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,920
I've been thinking about you.

1012
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,640
I may be able to get away tomorrow,
for an hour or so.

1013
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,560
OK. See you then.

1014
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,200
Bye-bye.

1015
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,760
There you are, Chris.

1016
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,200
Chloe tells me you've sustained
some personal loss in the market

1017
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,040
over the past few months.

1018
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:51,040
Well, I guess I've been a little bit
careless, not concentrating.

1019
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,920
And, of course,
I thought I made good decisions, but...

1020
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,800
Well, who could have predicted these?

1021
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,160
Look, I don't want
you and Chloe to worry.

1022
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,080
- You'll always have a safety net.
- You're too generous, sir.

1023
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,680
Oh, no, you've made Chloe happy,

1024
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,800
and that means a great deal
to Eleanor and me.

1025
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,960
Well, I think it's gonna be
an amazing holiday. Don't you, Chris?

1026
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,400
Yes.

1027
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,160
We have a choice of sleeping
on the boat or in the different hotels.

1028
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,200
- Boat.
- Boat.

1029
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,480
- Every time.
- Good. I say the boat.

1030
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,920
Do you know he's never been
to the Greek Islands.

1031
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,240
- What?
- No.

1032
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,840
- No, he's never been.
- You'll love it.

1033
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,760
No. I have been to Athens,
but I hear the Islands are paradise.

1034
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,840
Oh, that reminds me,

1035
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,360
we have to go to Sardinia to
pop in on Brook and Dougie Winston.

1036
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,440
- Oh, good.
- Oh, God.

1037
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,040
- No, no, the house is beautiful.
- Brook's fine, Dougie's a nightmare.

1038
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,960
Sounds so romantic, doesn't it?
Mikonos and Crete.

1039
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1040
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,600
I'm so anxious to see all the
beautiful old temples and theaters.

1041
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,680
Oh, God.

1042
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,200
Yeah. Oh, I'll do that with you.
Tom can stay...

1043
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,240
You know, I bought Chris
an ancient Greek fertility charm.

1044
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,160
- Do you remember?
- I'll never forget.

1045
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,920
I sent off for that fertility thingy.

1046
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,920
He had to put it under
his pillow for two months.

1047
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And absolutely nothing happened,
of course.

1048
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,040
Poor thing.

1049
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,720
- I'd just subjected him to the torture.
- They think he's firing blanks.

1050
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,800
- Oh, shut up!
- Hello?

1051
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,560
I miss you.

1052
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,360
- Love me. Just love me.
- No, because it's not funny.

1053
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,920
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

1054
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,120
Proof is in the pudding,
and there ain't been any pudding.

1055
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,280
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, you have to.

1056
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,960
When can you get here?

1057
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,400
Tomorrow. No, Monday.

1058
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,800
Look...

1059
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,200
It's a three-day weekend.

1060
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,040
Tuesday.

1061
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,600
Chris, I need to see you.

1062
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,440
I'll see what I can do.
I'll call you right back.

1063
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,960
I would love to meet Barbra Streisand.

1064
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,000
She's meant to be really lovely.
She's with that other American fella.

1065
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,640
- Who was that?
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.

1066
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,120
I forgot to sign some papers.
I may have to drive into town.

1067
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,160
Jack Garner?

1068
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,280
You can't go,
it's a bank holiday weekend.

1069
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,640
The traffic'll be terrible.

1070
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,120
- James Garner, that's it.
- I mean, we've all got plans.

1071
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,160
I don't mean today.

1072
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,920
They named their little dog
after Elaine Paige.

1073
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,320
Well, surely it can wait
a couple of days.

1074
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,200
- Why did they do that?
- 'Cause it howls all night long.

1075
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,800
- Yes, I'm sure it can.
- Oh, that's mean.

1076
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,640
I know. And it's
terribly small and furry.

1077
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,720
That's mean.

1078
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,800
I think tomorrow
we should go for a morning ride.

1079
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,360
I've some lovely new horses.

1080
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,040
Do you remember when
Chris came here first,

1081
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,080
and he had some
serious qualms about riding?

1082
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,240
- I spoke to Teddy.
- How is he?

1083
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,120
Well, this morning he was talking
about buying a horse of his own.

1084
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,800
- No.
- Yeah.

1085
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,400
I don't know, it was all in good fun.

1086
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,600
- Where from?
- Anyway...

1087
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,080
- I think Nan's got a really nice mare.
...he's a wonderful new horse.

1088
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,960
Telephone call, sir.
She said it was important.

1089
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,560
Excuse me.

1090
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
- Tomorrow morning?
- Do you wanna come?

1091
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,640
That bloody phone
has not stopped ringing all weekend.

1092
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,760
- I know.
- It's so irritating.

1093
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Hello?

1094
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,440
I tried to call your mobile,
but it's off.

1095
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,880
Are you mad calling me here?

1096
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,120
When are you coming over?

1097
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,200
I'm trying to make it for tomorrow.

1098
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,360
I can't wait till tomorrow,
I'm going crazy.

1099
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,280
- What the hell's the matter?
- I'm pregnant.

1100
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,440
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1101
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,000
'Cause we've got to go
and try and look at this...

1102
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,160
...horse for Chris.
- They got it in the navy?

1103
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,840
Yeah, the... It was lack of enough
vegetables, or something.

1104
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,440
I wonder if that's why they took
lemons and oranges...

1105
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,840
Well, they only had biscuits.

1106
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,280
Well, that's where
Rose's Lime Cordial originated...

1107
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:09,120
- Who keeps calling?
- It was Samantha, my secretary.

1108
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,320
I'm afraid I won't be able
to go riding tomorrow. I can't help it.

1109
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,680
I thought Samantha said she was
going to her parents this weekend.

1110
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,000
I know, it's all my fault. Poor girl.

1111
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,240
It's no big deal.

1112
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,480
I'll pop back into town.

1113
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,560
The whole thing'll take a few hours,
and it'll be off my mind. I promise.

1114
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,320
- That's a shame.
- It's really sad.

1115
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,000
Well, it is a pity because I...

1116
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,280
I think it's unfair
on Samantha too, frankly.

1117
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,720
Yeah. Well, it's unfortunate,

1118
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,920
but, you know,
Chris has a lot of responsibility.

1119
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,640
Well, anyway,
let's not worry about it. Let's...

1120
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,200
- Slave driver.
- Look, as long as we make lamb bone.

1121
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,280
- Can you, can you?
- Well, I think so.

1122
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:38,440
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1123
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,120
- How the hell did you get pregnant?
- I told you that weekend last month

1124
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,000
that we needed to be careful
and I didn't have protection,

1125
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,640
but you couldn't wait.

1126
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,440
What unbelievable bad luck.

1127
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,320
Christ, I can't get my wife pregnant
no matter how hard I try,

1128
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,200
and the minute you're unprotected
I knock you up.

1129
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,080
It's 'cause you love me,
and you don't love her.

1130
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,160
Is that your interpretation?

1131
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,320
It's a child conceived
out of genuine passion,

1132
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,960
not as part of some fertility project.

1133
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,960
OK. Well I'll go with you,
and we'll get it sorted.

1134
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,800
- I'm not doing that again.
- Again?

1135
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,400
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's the third time.

1136
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,000
I did it once when I was younger,
and then I did it for Tom.

1137
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,880
I didn't want to, but he insisted.

1138
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,920
Nola, I really can't see any other way.

1139
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
- Why can't I just have it?
- And what?

1140
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,000
- And we'll raise it together.
- That's obviously not possible.

1141
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,040
Why? You hate yourjob,
you hate your life.

1142
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,800
I mean, it seems like a blessing.
It's a sign.

1143
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,560
Look, Nola, I have to go.

1144
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,600
I'm juggling six things
at the same time

1145
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,240
just to make
this trip to the city look legit.

1146
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,200
I'll talk to you on Tuesday.

1147
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,520
Chris...

1148
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,720
You must... I expect you
to do the right thing, OK?

1149
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,320
I'm not walking away from this.

1150
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,920
Is anything the matter?
You seemed very gloomy all weekend.

1151
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,360
- I wanted to talk to you.
- What about?

1152
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,480
Us.

1153
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,920
Is something wrong?

1154
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,160
Yeah. There is.

1155
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,640
What?

1156
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,760
If you're still taking a hammering
financially in the market,

1157
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,320
you know it's not a problem.

1158
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,520
I can't keep leaning
on your father, Chloe.

1159
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,920
Papa gets more pleasure
out of helping his family,

1160
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,520
than all the possessions he owns.
You know that.

1161
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,280
What is it?

1162
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,160
Is it something to do
with those phone calls you kept getting?

1163
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:35,520
Because you acted
really strangely after each of them.

1164
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,280
Are you having an affair?

1165
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,480
Am I having an affair?

1166
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,640
Yeah, that's what I asked.

1167
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,040
- No.
- You are.

1168
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,280
Of course I'm not. Don't be silly.

1169
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,600
Do you not love me anymore?

1170
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,000
Of course I love you.

1171
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,400
Well, what's wrong?

1172
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,840
I just feel like I'm letting you down.

1173
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,920
You're not. How?

1174
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,560
Is it because I'm not getting pregnant?

1175
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,880
I just...

1176
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,920
...feel so guilty.

1177
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,440
So terribly guilty.

1178
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,840
Listen, Chris.

1179
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,360
We've both been to the doctor.
We're both perfectly healthy.

1180
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,880
I can conceive and you're perfectly
capable of making a woman pregnant.

1181
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,840
Is it me? Have I been horribly pushy
and obnoxious on the subject?

1182
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:02,560
Look, I... I just want a baby.
I want to have our baby.

1183
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,240
We haven't been lucky yet, that's all.

1184
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,400
Oh, Chloe.

1185
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,600
Let's get off the subject.

1186
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,640
Having a child should be something
that makes us both happy and excited,

1187
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,480
not a cause of all this
tension and anxiety and...

1188
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,120
I had to talk to somebody.

1189
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,760
I'm really suffering.

1190
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,920
Whatever you tell me goes no further.

1191
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,160
I'm contemplating leaving my wife
for another woman.

1192
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,520
But when the time came to tell her...

1193
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,160
...I couldn't do it.

1194
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,720
Yeah, well, it's not the easiest
thing in the world to do, is it?

1195
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,560
It's crazy.

1196
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,560
I can see no real future
with this other woman.

1197
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,000
And I have a very
comfortable life with my wife.

1198
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,400
- Yeah, but if you don't love her...
- I'm not saying I don't love her.

1199
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,080
Just not in the way I feel
about this other woman.

1200
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,840
Right.

1201
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,720
Maybe it's finally the difference
between love and lust.

1202
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,320
But what the hell
am I going to do if I leave Chloe?

1203
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,240
I don't fool myself that I haven't
gotten used to a certain kind of living.

1204
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,720
Am I supposed to give it all up?
For what?

1205
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,960
Is it for a woman you love?

1206
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,760
To live how? Where?

1207
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,040
- To work as what?
- Well, it seems to me that you...

1208
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,000
You're pretty good
at what you're doing.

1209
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,160
There must be anotherjob in another
firm that you can just, you know...

1210
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,280
Let's face it,
I'm the boss's son-in-law.

1211
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,480
And he loves me.

1212
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,080
Doesn't seem to me like you
want this other woman enough

1213
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,720
to give up everything
you've achieved for it.

1214
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,600
We're going away for three weeks.

1215
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,720
- When I get back I'll tell her.
- When you get back?

1216
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,200
What am I supposed to do?
Stop playing games with me!

1217
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,560
- I'm not playing games with you.
- Why don't you just tell her now then?

1218
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,800
I'd think you'd want
to stop living such a sham.

1219
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,880
- Look, it's not easy.
- Why not?

1220
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,960
If you're so bored at home with her
and you're so crazy about me,

1221
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,440
which is all you ever tell me...

1222
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,280
I don't wanna mess
this holiday up for everybody, OK?

1223
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,560
It's a big blow.

1224
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,760
And it's gonna make
a huge impact on everyone.

1225
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,200
How can you go on vacation with a
woman that you know you're gonna leave

1226
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,360
- the minute you get back?
- Keep your voice down.

1227
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,040
You wanna know how I feel?
I'm jealous, OK?

1228
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,200
I don't like the idea
of you making love with her.

1229
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,520
I don't like the idea of you going off
island-hopping with her. It's romantic!

1230
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,600
Hey, keep your voice down.

1231
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,840
You know I make love to her.

1232
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,400
And you know it's just routine.

1233
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,880
For God's sakes,
can't you wait a few weeks?

1234
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,880
Yeah.

1235
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,040
I just wanna know that
something's gonna happen, you know?

1236
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,760
It will.

1237
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,320
- It will.
- OK.

1238
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,760
The holiday's off.

1239
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,280
Why? What happened?

1240
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,520
Maurice Lewis has
to go in for an operation.

1241
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,760
Why?

1242
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,240
Disc in his back or something.
He can't walk.

1243
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,080
Anyway, he needs recovery time

1244
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,400
and everyone thought we should
just move it till after the summer.

1245
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,920
Let me just pack up my stuff.

1246
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,560
We should probably walk to the opera,
it's so close.

1247
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,320
Yeah.

1248
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,400
Hello?

1249
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,400
Hello?

1250
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,440
An opportunity has arisen, Chris,

1251
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,480
which I think may be
a lucrative one for you.

1252
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,560
Really?

1253
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,640
We're structuring something
with a Japanese company.

1254
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,840
It's an independent operation. There's
a great deal of money to be made.

1255
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,320
And my thought was, anyone in on the
ground floor stands to profit hugely,

1256
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,640
assuming our predictions are correct.

1257
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,120
- Sounds exciting.
- It is.

1258
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,160
Eleanor. I've just
told Chris the good news.

1259
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,160
But what would make me the happiest
has nothing to do with money.

1260
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,280
I'd like you to make me
a young grandmother.

1261
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,360
You already are a young grandmother.

1262
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,680
Yes. Tom and Heather
are trying for their second,

1263
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,760
but I'd like you to be a mother.

1264
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,040
Oh, all right.
Don't look at me like that.

1265
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:55,280
I'll be quiet. What would you
like for your birthday?

1266
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,080
- I don't know.
- Your birthday?

1267
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,120
Great. You forgot.

1268
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,840
I didn't actually.
I bought you something already.

1269
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,600
So my hints worked.

1270
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,760
- Mummy...
- I knew. I knew.

1271
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,840
- We are trying. We don't want to...
- All right.

1272
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,160
- Hello?
- Chris?

1273
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,480
- Excuse me.
- By all means.

1274
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,040
- I weigh as much as I did.
- Yes, darling.

1275
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,720
- Look, please relax, OK?
- I spoke out of turn.

1276
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,360
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1277
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,760
- What are you two bickering about?
- Nothing.

1278
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,080
I told you not to call me, I'd call you.

1279
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,720
Well, I... I...
I was waiting for you to call.

1280
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,120
I've been waiting a week.

1281
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,080
Well, there's always
people around and I can't talk.

1282
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,200
When are you coming home?

1283
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,760
In about two weeks.

1284
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,480
About two weeks? You said
the whole trip was three weeks!

1285
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,920
Yeah, right. Three weeks.

1286
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,800
Chris, Mummy and Papa are leaving.

1287
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,760
OK. OK...

1288
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,680
Who is that? What country are you in?

1289
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,800
Your mobile's been impossible.

1290
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,320
I told you. I'm in Greece.

1291
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,840
And there's always people around,
so I can't talk.

1292
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,520
I said I'd be home soon,
and I will call you.

1293
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,520
I'm just lonely. I'm anxious.

1294
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,000
Can you just?

1295
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,640
Please tell Chloe
as soon as you get home.

1296
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,440
I just want this situation
to be resolved.

1297
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,800
Do you miss me?

1298
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,840
OK. Bye, bye.

1299
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,120
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1300
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,920
- Are you leaving already?
- Yeah.

1301
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:39,240
Chris, it's Nola.
Where have I reached you?

1302
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,240
Sardinia.

1303
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,600
I'll be back in five or six days, OK?

1304
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,560
- Good morning, John.
- Oh, you're early, sir.

1305
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,400
- I'll bring the car around.
- Yes.

1306
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:05,760
You lied to me.

1307
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,400
- Oh, Jesus.
- You lied to me!

1308
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,960
- Quiet!
- I wanna see Chloe!

1309
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,800
- Quiet, quiet.
- I wanna talk to Chloe.

1310
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,840
Look, Christ, Christ.

1311
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,120
No, no, no, listen.
Listen, I can explain.

1312
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,440
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You're a liar! You're a liar!

1313
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,680
I can explain. I... Taxi!

1314
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,080
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Taxi!

1315
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,360
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Calm down.

1316
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,280
- Nola! Nola, calm down. Calm down.
- You're a liar! You're a liar!

1317
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,840
I came home deliberately,
I came home early.

1318
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,400
You're a liar! I wanna talk to Chloe.

1319
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,080
- I wanna talk to Chloe!
- Calm down. Calm the fuck down!

1320
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:33,000
I wanna talk to Chloe.
You liar! You're a liar!

1321
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,000
You're a liar!

1322
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,880
I decided to cut the trip short
because all this is eating away at me.

1323
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,760
I only came back
the day before yesterday

1324
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,000
because I need a week
in the city to deal with Chloe

1325
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,880
- without you breathing down my neck.
- You're driving me crazy!

1326
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,920
I don't know whether
to believe you or not.

1327
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,760
- Please believe me, Nola.
- Well, did you tell her?

1328
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,160
I was about to when you called.

1329
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,280
What does that have to do with anything?

1330
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,520
- I got flustered.
- Oh, please!

1331
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,120
I was all set to tell her
and then you called,

1332
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,240
and then I feel guilty about
telling you that I'm still in Greece.

1333
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,960
- You said Sardinia.
- I... I was talking fast.

1334
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,480
I... I didn't want her to know
what I was talking about.

1335
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,160
Well, she has to know eventually.

1336
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,440
- I can't tell her.
- Then I will.

1337
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,520
Nola, stop!

1338
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,840
Well, this is crazy.
We're having a child together!

1339
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,480
We don't have to have a child together.

1340
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,320
It would make life
a hell of a lot simpler if we didn't.

1341
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,440
Yeah, simpler for you, but not for me.

1342
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,800
It occurred to me
that even if you had the child,

1343
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,520
- I could help you out financially.
- That's not enough.

1344
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,520
Nola, be reasonable.

1345
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,600
That's exactly what Tom said
when he broke off our engagement.

1346
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,840
Being reasonable
got me where I am right now.

1347
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,240
So, you're threatening me?

1348
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,920
If I don't do what you say,
you're gonna go to my wife.

1349
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,840
Were you lying to me?

1350
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,400
All those times we made love,

1351
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,480
all those conversations,
were you lying to me then?

1352
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,080
- Of course I wasn't lying.
- Tell Chloe.

1353
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:49,000
Someone has to explain the situation.
Either you do it, or I'll do it.

1354
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,720
OK, OK. I'll do the right thing.

1355
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,200
Have you seen Chris?

1356
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,280
A minute ago. He went that way.

1357
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,400
Chris?

1358
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,360
Chris?

1359
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,320
Chris?

1360
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:08,880
Where are you, Chris?

1361
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,160
Chris?

1362
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,960
Chloe, are you there?

1363
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,520
Have you seen Chris anywhere?

1364
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,880
No. Could you come up for a minute?

1365
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,560
I want you to give me
some advice about this dress.

1366
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,160
Yeah, OK.

1367
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,680
I'm telling Chloe tomorrow.

1368
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,480
You say that every day,
and you always back out.

1369
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:00,560
I'm back where I started.
I want something done, Chris.

1370
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:02,640
If you don't have
the nerve to do it, I'll do it.

1371
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,600
That would be revenge for you against
the whole Hewett family, wouldn't it?

1372
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,680
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1373
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,520
My theory is you want me to tell Chloe
so you don't have to do it yourself.

1374
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,320
My God, it seems like you've
had this whole thing checked out

1375
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,920
- by some psychiatrist.
- I wish.

1376
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,080
I wish had someone to confide in,
but it's all so damn secretive.

1377
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,640
Look, Chris,
if I don't do something about this,

1378
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,760
we're gonna grow apart.
I'm having your child!

1379
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,360
I'm telling her tomorrow, Nola.
What more do you want me to do?

1380
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,520
What more? Tell her now!
Tell her tonight!

1381
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,880
I can't, not before she goes to sleep.
It wouldn't be the right time.

1382
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,920
Nola, tomorrow is fine.

1383
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,200
- What time will you get back from work?
- Same time I always get off, 6:30.

1384
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,800
So you'll be home by a quarter to seven?

1385
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,400
Yeah. Chris, you make me say
these things. I hate myself for them.

1386
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,680
- I just want us to be together.
- We will be.

1387
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,160
You were very nervy
all through the ballet.

1388
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,440
Did you hate it?

1389
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,160
- No, I'm just out of sorts.
- Yeah.

1390
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,120
I thought you were gonna pass out.

1391
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,480
Low blood sugar. I'll be better soon.

1392
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,760
I still can't do it with you tonight.

1393
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,240
I'm not over my little dose of whatever.

1394
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,480
Did the cleaner put one of my
tennis shirts in with your gear?

1395
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,680
No. What are you doing?

1396
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,440
Really? Just let me have a quick look.

1397
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,440
- I can't find it anywhere.
- No. Look, I'll check, I'll check.

1398
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:21,360
- I've got everything arranged in there.
- OK. I wasn't gonna disturb anything.

1399
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,160
'Cause I don't know
where else it can be.

1400
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,080
She's always bloody
mixing my stuff in with yours.

1401
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,200
Is this it?

1402
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,840
See, I knew it!
She always bloody does that.

1403
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,840
I've got to have words
with her about it.

1404
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,520
It's really...

1405
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,320
What did you just put in your pocket?

1406
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,000
- Oh, it's just my pill box.
- What do you mean a pill box?

1407
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,440
A pill box. You know
what a pill box looks like.

1408
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,200
Let me have a look at it.
What pills are you taking?

1409
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,840
No, they're just my pills. I need them.

1410
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,520
No, no, no, it's for stress,
'cause you stress me so much.

1411
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,800
- Guess what?
- What?

1412
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,280
I got tickets for the theater
for tomorrow night.

1413
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,320
You haven't. That's not like you.

1414
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,640
- What for?
- The Woman in White.

1415
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,520
- I heard it's great.
- I thought you hated musicals.

1416
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,320
No, that's not so.

1417
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,840
- And anyway, you love his music.
- Well, that's great.

1418
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,840
I'll have to meet you
outside the theater,

1419
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,280
'cause I'll be coming
straight from the gallery.

1420
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,080
Why don't you take the chauffeur?

1421
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:15,760
I'll grab a taxi, and with any luck
I can get an hour of tennis in.

1422
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,800
You're so sweet.

1423
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,360
You knew how much
I wanted to see that.

1424
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,200
All right, come to bed,
because you're tired, my darling.

1425
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,080
OK, I will.

1426
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,720
- Hello?
- Hello, Nola?

1427
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,240
When you get off work today,
come right home.

1428
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,320
I have some good news.

1429
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,760
Everything's taken care of,
but I'm reluctant to talk on the phone.

1430
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,720
You've got to meet me
right after work.

1431
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,480
We have... plans to make.

1432
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,760
OK. I'll cancel my agent appointment.

1433
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,560
It's good. This is good.

1434
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,440
I'll see you soon. Bye.

1435
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,880
- Was it him?
- Yeah.

1436
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,480
So, you'll have to be prepared
to cash flow the first six months.

1437
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,720
Is that right, Chris? A half year?

1438
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:09,800
Yes.

1439
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,520
A half year should do it, maybe less.

1440
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,240
Good. Jolly good.
Well, see you next time.

1441
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,360
Good.

1442
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:27,600
Sayonara indeed. I thought you
showed some interesting ideas there

1443
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,760
for developing their capacity.

1444
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,360
- I'm excited about this venture, Rod.
- Good, good.

1445
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,200
- Playing a little tennis later?
- Yes.

1446
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:49,720
Amazing energy. Love it. Envy it.

1447
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,440
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Chris.

1448
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,160
I'm a friend of Nola's,
your neighbor from next door.

1449
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:03,440
We met here last...

1450
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,920
I'm sorry, I don't let anybody in.

1451
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
But... but, do you not remember?
We met...

1452
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,640
She asked you something
about your trouble with your mice,

1453
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,280
and you mentioned
something about peanut butter.

1454
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,360
- Oh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

1455
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,320
I'm Chris Wilton, the tennis instructor.

1456
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,800
Well, what's the trouble?

1457
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,720
No trouble at all really, and I...
I don't mean to disturb you.

1458
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,720
I was wondering if I could...
could look at your TV reception.

1459
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,280
- We seem to have trouble next door.
- Oh, with the TV?

1460
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,360
Yes.

1461
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:39,400
We're getting some interference,
and it's Nola's favorite TV night.

1462
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,680
So I don't know if it's the
aerial on the roof or if it's us.

1463
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,760
- It's in there.
- Thank... thank you.

1464
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,840
I have to take my medicine.

1465
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,800
There was no trouble before.
I had it on and it was fine.

1466
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,840
Didn't you say your name was Harris?

1467
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,280
Mrs. Eastby?

1468
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,440
It's lan.

1469
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,440
Mrs. Eastby?

1470
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,440
Mrs. Eastby? It's lan.

1471
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:44,200
I'm going down the corner shop.
Can I get you anything?

1472
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,200
Mrs. Eastby, are you all right?

1473
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,040
- Hi, princess.
- Hi.

1474
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:18,800
D'you ever get that
portable CD player we talked about?

1475
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,920
Yes, I did.
Thank you so much for helping me.

1476
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Excellent.

1477
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,400
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye.

1478
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,360
Nola.

1479
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,160
Excuse me.

1480
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,120
Hello.

1481
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,160
Where are you?

1482
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,920
I'm almost there. I'll be two minutes.

1483
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,080
- Good evening.
- Hello.

1484
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:22,160
- How much?
- That's two pounds, please.

1485
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,760
Two pounds.

1486
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
- Two pounds. My tickets?
- Yes. Thank you.

1487
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,920
It's a terrible mess in there, sir.

1488
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,040
Well, I think it's pretty obvious
what's happened here.

1489
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,120
Someone's robbed
and killed the old lady.

1490
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,520
As he, or they, were running out

1491
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:58,080
they've run into the Rice woman
coming in, so they've shot her too.

1492
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,440
Either out of panic,

1493
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,520
or because they saw a chance
to make an additional score.

1494
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,200
Poor unsuspecting soul
came home at the wrong moment.

1495
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,400
He's cleared out the house
of all prescription drugs, sir.

1496
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,840
Oh, no, it's definitely
a drugs-related robbery.

1497
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,280
He might have known there
was an old lady living in flat 8.

1498
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:13,680
Probably cased her.

1499
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,120
Was surprised by running
into the other woman.

1500
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,200
She picked the wrong time to come home.

1501
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,920
Some people just don't have any luck.

1502
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,920
Yeah, I just spoke to her.
This is unbelievable.

1503
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,880
Half an hour ago I came down the stairs,

1504
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,560
knocked on Mrs. Eastby's door
'cause I couldn't...

1505
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,840
Do you need anything from the car?

1506
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,960
Yeah. You can tell the
exhibits officer to get a move on,

1507
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:35,280
- 'cause this is getting ridiculous.
- Yeah, this is quite important.

1508
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,280
She usually bakes today, and
I thought maybe she'd run out of stuff.

1509
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,040
So I asked her if she
needed anything, and then

1510
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,480
- So, half an hour ago? Spoke to her?
- She didn't answer.

1511
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:43,280
- Yeah, half an hour ago. Yeah.
- So whoever it was, was still in there.

1512
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,080
That's terrifying. I can't believe that.

1513
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,800
- So someone was in there?
- And you spoke to Nola Rice,

1514
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,840
- and did she say anything?
- Sorry to interrupt.

1515
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,640
Could we send the
photographers in now, please?

1516
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:52,840
No, hang on. If you just wait.

1517
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:55,280
We've just got to get the
exhibit officer in there first.

1518
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:58,600
Chris, Chris, can you
liaise with this man here?

1519
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:01,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just catch him there.

1520
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,640
Well, I ran...
Yeah, I bumped into Nola right here...

1521
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,600
Scenes of Crime will be
on their way very shortly, all right?

1522
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:06,960
- Yeah...
- Yeah, I spoke...

1523
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,200
I bumped into her here.
We talked and we chatted.

1524
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,160
I recommended a piece
of music equipment.

1525
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:13,680
- She'd bought it. Yeah, and...
- Music equipment? What was that?

1526
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:17,080
Nothing. It was a portable CD player
which reads MP3s, CD rewrites...

1527
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,160
It's drugs, guv.
Someone after money for some drugs.

1528
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,320
Well, Mrs. Eastby wasn't wealthy.

1529
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,680
- They don't care.
- Drugs?

1530
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,600
Yeah, definitely drugs.
Someone after money for 'em, and...

1531
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,760
They'll kill you for a pound
if they wanted to, you know.

1532
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,240
Well, it's a sorry state of affairs,
isn't it?

1533
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:32,680
Well, it's not as if the old lady
had any enemies. She rarely went out.

1534
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,040
- Used a shotgun.
- A shotgun?

1535
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:35,800
That's a... That's a bit obvious,
isn't it?

1536
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,000
- Somebody must've seen something.
- Oh, not if it was sawn-off.

1537
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:41,040
They can make them pretty small.
Catherine, love, you can't park there.

1538
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:43,320
Leave that clear.
We've got the SOCO coming down.

1539
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:47,360
Did you like the musical last night?

1540
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:52,000
Yeah, I did. It was good fun.
Pretty music.

1541
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,480
Yeah, he's very good.

1542
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,240
I'm gonna get tickets
for Mummy and Papa.

1543
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,360
Good.

1544
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:05,600
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

1545
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:09,920
Oh, my God! Nola!

1546
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,760
- Nola Rice.
- What?

1547
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:16,760
She was killed in a burglary.
A... a drugs burglary.

1548
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:20,400
What? Here, let me see that.

1549
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,280
Jesus Christ!

1550
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,280
Apparently, she was
coming home from work,

1551
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:32,320
and someone who was already there
who'd burgled another flat and rob...

1552
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,920
And shot an old lady,
ran into Nola by chance, and...

1553
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,960
She was entering the building,
and he was running out and he shot her.

1554
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,320
Oh, my God.

1555
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,400
Hello?

1556
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:52,040
Yeah. Yeah,
we've just this second read it.

1557
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,680
Isn't itjust terrible?

1558
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,040
I never got along with her,
but this is just tragic.

1559
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:00,120
- It's tragic.
- Does Tom know?

1560
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,400
I've just called him.
He can't believe it.

1561
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,720
I know.

1562
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:07,320
Wait, wait, that must be him.
I'll call you back.

1563
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,160
Hello?

1564
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,720
Yeah, we've just read it,
and Mummy just called.

1565
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,640
Well, yeah, yeah, I know.
I mean, wrong place at the wrong time.

1566
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,080
I suppose she must've...

1567
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,800
I mean, disturbed a burglar
or burglars, or whatever.

1568
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:21,160
I mean, it doesn't... It doesn't say
how many of them there were.

1569
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,960
Well, even Mummy's really shaken up,

1570
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,240
and you know they
weren't exactly friends.

1571
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,560
It says here that there's been a rise
in drug-related crime in the area

1572
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:30,520
over the past year.

1573
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:33,240
Did you hear that? Yeah.

1574
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:37,680
I just can't believe it.
It's just... I know.

1575
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,400
Mummy.

1576
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:49,560
I've got something to tell you.

1577
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,640
But I want Chris to be here.

1578
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,840
Chris?

1579
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,880
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

1580
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,960
He was just in here. Chris?

1581
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:02,640
Chris?

1582
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,320
He was just here.

1583
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,040
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1584
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,560
Just wait. Wait, wait. Chris?

1585
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,080
Where are you? Chris?

1586
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,840
Well, what did you want to tell me?

1587
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,600
Well, I just really want him to be here.

1588
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,000
Hang on, there he is. There you are!

1589
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,680
- Can we tell her now?
- Sure.

1590
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,000
Well, I wanted you to be here.

1591
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,600
Well, what is it?

1592
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,160
Mummy...

1593
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:08,000
You can finally
crack open the champagne.

1594
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,800
It looks like I'm pregnant.

1595
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:12,120
- When did you hear?
- This morning.

1596
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:16,000
- Oh, I'm so delighted.
- Oh, good.

1597
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,120
Alec?

1598
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,920
Alec? Come here.

1599
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,560
We're both walking on air.

1600
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:26,760
Well, you're walking on air. Your
husband looks a bit shell shocked.

1601
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,720
- 'Cause I've exhausted him, poor thing.
- What?

1602
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,040
Chloe's pregnant.

1603
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:32,600
Oh, what a great day.
Oh, my darling, congratulations.

1604
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:35,040
I'm absolutely thrilled.
I couldn't be more pleased.

1605
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,760
Thank you so much.
It's such a relief.

1606
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,800
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

1607
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,440
- Yes?
- Phone call, sir. Your secretary.

1608
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:41,880
It's wonderful, isn't it? Look at her,
doesn't she look gorgeous?

1609
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,720
- Margaret, I'm pregnant!
- Congratulations! That's wonderful.

1610
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,240
Thank you, Margaret.

1611
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:49,640
Sam?

1612
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:52,280
Yeah, there's a message for you
that a Mike Banner,

1613
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:54,240
Detective Mike Banner, called.

1614
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,440
He wants you to call him
at Shepherd's Bush police station.

1615
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,960
Yeah. No, I don't think it's urgent,
but he left a number.

1616
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,000
- Banner?
- Sweetheart...

1617
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,440
I bet it was that night...

1618
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:07,800
- You better give me the number.
- Look, that's flattering.

1619
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,760
Well, the last time you went,
he said everything was fine, didn't he?

1620
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,000
Yes, and he just made me
completely calm down.

1621
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:18,280
Oh, I just can't believe it.
It's marvelous.

1622
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,920
OK. Thanks, Samantha. Bye.

1623
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,560
He just seemed odd,
there was something weird.

1624
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,880
- Granny would have been thrilled.
...alternative medicine.

1625
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:31,120
Granny would have loved it.
I wish she could be here.

1626
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:34,000
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Congratulations!

1627
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,840
Detective Banner, please.

1628
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,920
This is Chris Wilton.

1629
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:42,600
Oh, hello.

1630
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:45,160
This is Chris Wilton. You called?

1631
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,120
Oh, yes. I was wondering if there
was a time you could drop in here?

1632
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,440
Or if it's more convenient,
we can come and see you.

1633
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,920
- In reference to what?
- I'd rather not explain on the phone.

1634
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,280
It's just a few questions, and I'm sure
you'd prefer it to be discreet.

1635
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,360
I've no reason to bring a lawyer, do I?

1636
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:04,440
I certainly hope not.

1637
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,560
- Chris Wilton. Detective Banner.
- Good afternoon.

1638
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:16,640
- How do you do? Take a seat.
- Thank you.

1639
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:19,560
This is nothing to be alarmed about.

1640
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:23,680
We're just doing a routine investigation
into the Betty Eastby-Nola Rice murders.

1641
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:28,000
Were you acquainted
with either of the victims?

1642
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,440
Peripherally, I knew Nola Rice.

1643
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,280
How?

1644
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,480
She was engaged for a time
to the man who's now my brother-in-law.

1645
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,280
That's...

1646
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,080
...Tom Hewett?
- That's correct.

1647
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:46,160
They broke up. A year ago. More.

1648
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,600
When did you last see her?

1649
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,840
Oh, God, I can't remember.

1650
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,520
At the Tate Modern.
My wife and I ran into her.

1651
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,040
But that was a long time ago.

1652
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,520
Have you seen her since?

1653
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,720
Not that I recall.

1654
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,120
Have?

1655
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,760
Have you ever seen this?

1656
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,720
No. What is it?

1657
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,640
Are you aware
that Nola Rice kept a diary?

1658
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:32,840
No.

1659
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,840
As you can see...

1660
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,840
...you're all over it.

1661
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,440
Yes, I can see that.

1662
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,880
Do you still claim
that you haven't seen her,

1663
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:56,480
except for more than a year ago
at the Tate Modern?

1664
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,080
You can't blame me for trying to hide
the fact that I had an affair with her.

1665
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,080
But you people have to protect me here.

1666
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,800
I hope you don't think
I had anything to do with her murder.

1667
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,840
How long did your affair go on?

1668
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:19,960
It began casually
when she was still engaged to Tom.

1669
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,920
They broke up, she moved away.

1670
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,760
She came back and I ran into her
at the Tate Modern, and it began again.

1671
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:32,160
God, have a heart.

1672
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,360
My wife is gonna have a baby.

1673
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:37,880
This will devastate her.

1674
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:40,480
Did you...

1675
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:44,720
...promise that you were going
to leave your wife and marry Miss Rice?

1676
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,200
No, I did not.

1677
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:49,920
I mean, it's possible
she had that fantasy.

1678
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:54,160
And, obviously, she wrote that I did.

1679
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,320
But I tried to finesse
that point with her.

1680
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,640
I didn't want the
sexual relationship to end,

1681
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,800
but I'm not gonna break up my home.

1682
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,480
My wife and I are
trying very hard to have a baby.

1683
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:15,200
We've seen several
fertility doctors, et cetera.

1684
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:19,880
You can check that out if you like,
but I beg you to be discreet.

1685
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:22,000
But you did lead her on,

1686
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,880
so that she had the impression
you were unhappy at home.

1687
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:27,840
I tried to tip-toe around it
and not lead her on,

1688
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,680
but she's going to believe
what she wants to believe.

1689
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:37,000
Look, don't irresponsibly run roughshod
over this and wreck people's lives.

1690
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:40,480
I mean, there is no case
because I would not harm anyone,

1691
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,640
much less Nola Rice.

1692
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,920
Isn't it obvious
that somebody killed her neighbor,

1693
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,000
and she walked in when it was happening?

1694
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,400
God, I beg you, don't go on
a fishing expedition over this and...

1695
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,800
...wreck people's lives.

1696
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,960
My family, my marriage is at stake.

1697
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,680
We just have to
check out everything in a murder case.

1698
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:10,160
OK, but I'm not your man.

1699
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:13,880
I know it's not the most
honorable thing to cheat on your wife,

1700
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:16,200
but that does not make me a murderer.

1701
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:19,280
We're... obligated
to review the situation.

1702
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,360
I understand
it's sensitive stuff for you.

1703
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,040
And if we have to talk to you again,

1704
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:25,440
we'll do everything in our power
to keep it very private.

1705
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,040
Your personal life's your own.

1706
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:30,960
We're not making any moral judgments,
just investigating a crime.

1707
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:43,240
I understand.

1708
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:45,800
Look...

1709
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:48,080
...if you have to get
in contact with me again,

1710
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:50,160
which, God in heaven,
I hope you don't,

1711
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:52,200
please call me on my mobile.

1712
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,680
This is my number.

1713
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,160
Thanks.

1714
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,840
One other thing.

1715
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,320
Do you own or have access to a shotgun?

1716
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:05,960
Me?

1717
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:07,360
No.

1718
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:11,320
My father-in-law shoots
on the estate, but not me.

1719
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,560
You can check it out, but...

1720
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,520
...I beg you to consider mine
and his position.

1721
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,680
Of course.

1722
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,640
Thank you.

1723
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:36,280
So, what do you think?

1724
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,600
I think it's what it looks like.

1725
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:40,720
Someone robbed and killed Mrs. Eastby,

1726
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,360
who was surprised leaving,
and killed Nola Rice.

1727
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:48,960
Yeah, I know. I know, it's got
drug robbery written all over it.

1728
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,040
He's 'specting a baby.

1729
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,640
OK, he's not gonna win
a medal for fidelity, but...

1730
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,400
...we can find out discreetly enough

1731
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,480
whether the Hewetts
had a shotgun unaccounted for.

1732
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:05,440
I don't think that he would know the
first thing about stealing one though,

1733
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:08,320
never mind sawing one off.

1734
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:12,120
It's a bit of a stretch.
He's got no previous convictions.

1735
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:13,920
Not even a speeding ticket.

1736
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,800
The coroner says
that Eastby was killed first.

1737
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:19,200
- Yeah.
- There's no sign of a forced entry.

1738
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,520
So Mrs. Eastby knew the killer,
if she let him in.

1739
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:23,080
Well, come on, Mike.

1740
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:25,000
Ninety percent
of the crimes we go out on,

1741
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,200
people open their doors
and invite the criminals in.

1742
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,600
Yeah, I know, you're right.
I'm just thinking out loud.

1743
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:32,640
- It's just he's got a real motive.
- Yeah, maybe.

1744
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:37,320
But a motive, as you and I
both painfully know, is not a case.

1745
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,440
I'm torn because the Rice murder
was clearly an afterthought,

1746
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,360
but I'd love to pursue it a little more.

1747
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:45,800
But I'm reluctant to fish around
and cause problems for everybody.

1748
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,160
Well, if something develops,
we can pursue it.

1749
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,960
I doubt anything's
gonna drop into our laps.

1750
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,400
Chris.

1751
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,120
Nola...

1752
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,440
...it wasn't easy.

1753
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:10,200
But when the time came,
I could pull the trigger.

1754
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:15,080
You never know who your neighbors are
till there's a crisis.

1755
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:20,880
You can learn to push the guilt
under the rug and... go on.

1756
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,840
You have to.

1757
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,440
Otherwise it overwhelms you.

1758
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,680
And what about me?

1759
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:31,480
What about the next-door neighbor?

1760
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:35,240
I had no involvement
in this awful affair.

1761
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:41,600
Is there no problem about me
having to die as an innocent bystander?

1762
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:47,920
The innocent are sometimes slain
to make way for a grander scheme.

1763
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,240
You were collateral damage.

1764
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,800
So was your own child.

1765
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,040
Sophocles said:

1766
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,720
"To never have been born

1767
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:07,800
may be the greatest boon of all."

1768
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:12,480
Prepare to pay the price, Chris.

1769
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:15,560
Your actions were clumsy.

1770
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:17,320
Full of holes.

1771
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:20,600
Almost like someone
begging to be found out.

1772
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:27,080
It would be fitting
if I were apprehended

1773
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:29,040
and punished.

1774
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:33,880
At least there would be
some small sign ofjustice.

1775
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:36,960
Some small...

1776
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:41,080
...measure of hope
for the possibility of meaning.

1777
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:46,640
Chris Wilton killed them.
I see how he did it.

1778
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:48,480
What?

1779
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:51,240
It's as we speculated

1780
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:53,720
and said was too elaborate,
but that's what he did.

1781
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,880
He killed the next-door neighbor first
to throw us off the scent

1782
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:58,640
and set up the appearance of a robbery.

1783
01:58:58,720 --> 01:58:59,720
He waited in the hall.

1784
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,680
He knew she'd be back
the same time as usual,

1785
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:05,040
and he killed her, making it seem like
she surprised a burglar running out.

1786
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:07,240
He planned it all so he could
make the theater in time

1787
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:09,560
to strengthen his alibi,
if one became necessary.

1788
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:12,160
Now, I haven't figured out
the weapon problem,

1789
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:13,720
and I know it's a lot to ask a jury,

1790
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,960
but the correctness of it
came to me in my sleep

1791
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:17,800
and I am going to break this case.

1792
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,720
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, Mike.

1793
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:20,760
What?

1794
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,800
Not that your dream
isn't of primary interest to a jury.

1795
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:24,120
What's the bad news?

1796
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:27,080
There was another shooting
in the area last night, 4am.

1797
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:29,880
A drug addict killed.
Looks like a drug sale turned nasty.

1798
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:33,200
What, and he confessed
to killing two women before he died?

1799
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:34,960
No, he didn't have to.

1800
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,240
The old woman's wedding ring
was right in his pocket.

1801
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:42,160
- No.
- Name and date engraved right on it.

1802
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:46,360
- I don't believe it.
- I know. I know.

1803
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:48,760
Your case looked good, lots of motive.

1804
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,080
But his motive
was pretty strong too. Heroin.

1805
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,800
Junkie with a long string
of convictions.

1806
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,400
Killed by one of his own, no doubt.

1807
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,320
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

1808
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,720
You can traumatize me
with the rest of your dreams.

1809
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,200
No, wait.

1810
02:00:02,240 --> 02:00:06,240
What if Wilton did it, threw the
jewels away, this guy finds them?

1811
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:11,040
I don't know.
See what tonight's dream tells you.

1812
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:13,840
I'm sure a jury will be interested.

1813
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,760
Come on.

1814
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,360
I give up.

1815
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,240
I knew Wilton didn't do it.

1816
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,640
He's another poor schmuck
who cheated on his wife.

1817
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:26,040
When you see those pictures
of Nola Rice, you can see why though.

1818
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:29,520
What a world. Am I right?

1819
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,960
Careful, careful.
I'm always afraid they'll drop.

1820
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,040
- Oh, chill out, Dad.
- Babies are so, so soft.

1821
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:38,080
Right. Champagne.

1822
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,360
- I think he's got your eyes, Chloe.
- Really?

1823
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:42,800
I think he's got
your coloring darling, I really do.

1824
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:46,120
Mummy, you can't tell anything yet.
They change all the time.

1825
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:49,040
- My nephew.
- Uncle, Uncle Tom.

1826
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,760
- Oh, look at these flowers.
- No, he does look like Christopher.

1827
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,320
Actually, speaking of which, didn't you
move into Alan Sinclair's old office?

1828
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,760
- You lucky swine.
- Oh, Mummy, look, he's dreaming.

1829
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,320
Let's work on number two. Come on.

1830
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:02,760
Come on, he is a handsome boy.
Look at that face.

1831
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,080
Yeah, he's gorgeous.

1832
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:06,200
Right, here we are. Eleanor. Please...

1833
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:07,640
- Chloe...
- Good stuff, Papa.

1834
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:09,200
- Thank you, darling. There you are.
- There we go.

1835
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:11,440
- It's all right, you stay there.
- I'll pass them round, shall I?

1836
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:12,480
Please do.

1837
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,640
- What a good idea.
- Darling, have one.

1838
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:15,920
- To Terence Elliot Wilton.
- Yes.

1839
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,400
With parents like Chloe and Chris,

1840
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,280
this child will be great
at anything he sets his mind to.

1841
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:22,880
- Thank you, Mummy.
- He will. He...

1842
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,880
Do you know what,
I don't care if he's great.

1843
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,280
I just hope that he's lucky.

1844
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:27,960
- Oh, lovely.
- What a lovely thought.

1845
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:29,360
- He probably will be.
- Absolutely adorable.

1846
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:31,280
- Mummy, are you sure I'm allowed this?
- Yes, yes.

1847
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:34,200
- Yes, of course you are.
- You haven't had any for months.

1848
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,640
I'd get it down you now, while you can.

1849
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:37,000
Isn't he handsome?
My God, he's handsome.

1850
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:39,240
Bet you any money
the next one's a girl.

1851
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,800
What are you saying about him?

1852
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,880
I was just saying he's got
the most adorable cheeks.

1853
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,920
We were just saying how handsome he is.
Just so extraordinarily handsome.

1854
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,280
I wonder what he's thinking.

1855
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:51,600
Well, you know, they said
he was a thinker. The nurses.

1856
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:53,320
- Deep thoughts. Deep thoughts.
- Here we are.

1857
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:55,320
- To Terence.
- To Terence.

1858
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:58,080
- To Terence.
- And all that sail on him.
